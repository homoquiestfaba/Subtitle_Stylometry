always different for me.

I'd been an elf at santaville

I knew the names
of every reindeer,

how many lords were leaping

before I learned arithmetic.

Ok, what'd you get
for Christmas last year?

Oh, that's really great.

by the time I was a teenager,

little sales manager
you've been this year.

Santa and I are like this.

182
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,197
He knows I'm way too busy
for that stuff.

[Joy to the world playing]

186
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,250
I mean it, honey.
3 years is way too long.

00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,217
We all miss you.

188
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,253
I wish I could, dad,

189
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,155
But we launch a new line
the first week of January.

190
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,560
It's huge. There's no way
I can take time off.

191
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,326
I understand.

192
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,995
You must be doin'
a heck of a job.

193
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,897
I just wish you didn't
have to be so far away.

194
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,101
Well, you could come
to Boston.

195
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,038
It is my understanding
that trains go both ways.

196
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,542
Yeah. Well, I guess that's
somethin' we have in common,

197
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,010
'Cause santaville
never closes either,

198

So I can never leave.
What would the kids say?

199
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,883
Um, maybe that Santa's
visiting his daughter.

Honey, you know Santa
doesn't have any children.

201
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,189
Oh. Right. Santa has elves.

Everybody knows
how to play checkers.

00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,979
You make the games here
or at the north pole?

That's a very good question,

anyone here anymore,

think about it.

to 80 degrees in that place?

287
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,970
Th-they think it makes people
spend more.

288
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,105

from heatstroke?

- Not good.
- Not good. Not good.

to practicing law.

missing my choir practice?

357
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,245
No, Brenda, I don't mean
for you to miss choir practice.

358
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,379
I know you have a solo.

359
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,215
- Clear out.
- I just meant...

360
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,050
I'll do it if you want,
Ms. Crosby.

361
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,284
Look, just call me, ok?
I have to go.

362
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,286
[Sighs] Hi. Sorry. Business.

363
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,322
- No problem.
- How's my father? Is he ok?

364
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,557
Oh, sure. Yeah. He's fine.

365
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,258
Listen, I have my truck
parked right over here.

366
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm still not exactly clear
on what happened.

367
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,429
How did he get hurt?

368
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,996
Doctor said it
was the worst

369
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,332
Sleighing accident
he's ever seen.

370
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,366
Of course, he said it was

371
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,568
The only sleighing accident
he's ever seen, so...

372
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,471
Actually there were
34 sleighing accidents

373
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:15,208
In new england just last year.
It's not funny.

374
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,508
Right. Very serious.

375
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,445
Driving a sleigh
in the middle of the night,

376
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,246
That is so typical.

377
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,413
He's lucky
he didn't break his neck.

378
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,285
Uh, I think it would take more
than a head-on with a tree

379
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,118
To keep your dad down.

380
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,419
Busted up his leg
pretty good, though.

381
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,456
Won't be driving anything
for a while.

382
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,460
How l... did the doctor say how
long he'd be in the hospital?

383
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,262
Oh, he's home.

384
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,198
Home? It hasn't
even been 2 days.

385
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,134
You ever try to keep Nick
somewhere he didn't wanna be?

386
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,301
Point taken.

387
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,106
Don't worry, though. I've been
takin' good care of him...

388
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,439
Me, Ginny, Earl.

389
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,277
Sounds like he doesn't
even really need me here.

390
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,445
Are you kidding? That's all
he's been talking about.

391
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,315
Oh. Good.

392
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,622
Nick says you like it
in the city.

393
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,422
Uh-huh.

394
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,392
Must keep you
pretty busy, though,

395
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,827
Work and all.
He sure misses you.

396
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,696
I'm sorry.
What was your name?

397
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,100
Peter. Peter. Peter lowdell.
It's ok.

398
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,133
Oh. Peter. Right.

399
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,369
Peter, do you work
for my father?

400
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,736
I used to be on the payroll.

401
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,738
Now I'm more
what you call a volunteer.

402
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,409
Pick up odd jobs
around town, though,

403
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,578
Paint signs for the locals,
that kind of thing.

404
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,514
Mainly I like Nick.
I like it here.

405
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,650
It's a nice place.

406
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,153
Right.

407
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,326
Green Mountain number 57
departing Chester

408
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,130
For white river junction.
All aboard.

409
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,272
You don't remember me, do you?

410
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,207
Should I?

411
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,176
I don't know.

412
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,377
We talked about the ballet once.

413
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,479
Sorry.

414
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,583
Long time ago.

415
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,167
Wow. The inn look deserted.

416
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,169
They don't serve lunches
anymore.

417
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,502
Business was too slow.

418
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,504
Dinner's only on the weekends.

419
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,572
You're kidding.

420
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,875
Wow. That place was always
packed this time of year.

421
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,680
Families never missed
celebrating Christmas.

422
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,554
There she is!

423
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,623
Dad! Oh, my God!

424
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,625
Oh, I'm sorry you had to come
all this way, honey.

425
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,594
- Oh, no. Stop. A-are you ok?
- Oh, I'm fine.

426
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,928
You didn't tell me
he was in a wheelchair.

427
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,165
Oh, I'm not in a wheelchair.
I mean,

428
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,433
I'm in a wheelchair, but I can
get around great on crutches.

429
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,802
- No, you can't.
- Mind your own business.

430
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,639
You know, I should
be really angry at you.
What were you thinking?

431
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:04,576
Well, I'd been thinking about
enterin' dasher in the derby.

432
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,245
Dad...

433
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,314
Dasher is 20 years old.
Neither one of you

434
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,649
Has any business
riding around in a sleigh.

435
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,319
Don't you start, too.
I've been gettin' it
from all sides, honey.

436
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,253
Good. You deserve it.

437
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,224
- That's what I told him.
- [Clears throat]

438
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,726
Listen, it's just great
havin' you back here.

439
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,727
Now we can get started.

440
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,429
- Well, dad, i...
- I've even hung the mistletoe.

441
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,430
You just worry
about getting better.

442
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,866
Hey, I'm not worried
about anything, honey,

443
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,000
Not with you back.

444
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,239
It's gonna be like old times,
holly home for Christmas.

445
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,240
Who's hungry?

446
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,241
Speaking of which,

447
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,343
I was thinking about
your pot roast this morning.

448
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,777
Oh, you should taste it, Peter.

449
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,979
She makes it with,
uh, carrots and potatoes,
a-and she has a light sauce.

450
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:41,881
Can't wait.

451
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,716
It's not bland
like your Turkey meatloaf.

452
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,650
You like my Turkey meatloaf.

453
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,286
I hate your Turkey meatloaf.
It's terrible.

454
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,486
You always eat it.
You've never complained.

455
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,255
You... you put ketchup
and mustard and all...

456
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,389
No, that's all
that you give me.

457
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,590
I-I've been tryin' to humor you
by makin' you feel good.

458
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,460
- You know what'd make me feel...
- Ok!

459
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,427
I'll make the pot roast.

460
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,929
[Sighs]

461
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,474
Well, he's got a pot
for the pot roast.

462
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,377
That's about it.
Have to go to the grocery store.

463
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,644
Still pacing yourself?

464
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,380
Excuse me?

465
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,981
That's how you phrased it.

466
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,984
365 days a year,
you have to pace yourself

467
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,255
With this whole
Christmas spirit thing.

468
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,957
We have met before.

469
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,894
You should tell him.

470
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,495
What? Tell who?

471
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,364
That you're not staying
for Christmas. He's...

472
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,000
He's getting his hopes up.

473
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:38,470
I'm sorry. Exactly when did
I invite you to discuss my...

474
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,440
[Cellphone rings]

475
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,707
[Ring]

476
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,641
Here.

477
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,313
You can borrow my truck
to go to the market.

478
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:46,978
[Ring]

479
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,382
You should probably get that.

480
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,016
[Ring]

481
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:50,982
Yeah, Brenda?

482
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,051
Mr. holt's Celtic line
is ready for shipping.

483
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:56,423
Yes. Yes.
Have them shipped right away.

484
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,373
Holly?

485
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,041
Holly Crosby?

486
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,845
It's della, della Wallace.

487
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,412
Well, Wallace now.

488
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,881
Della Hamilton from high school.

489
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,450
Oh. Della.

490
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,953
Wow. I-it's been forever.
I can't believe it.

491
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:27,753
I know.

492
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,456
Oh, you look fabulous.

493
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,725
I almost didn't recognize you
without your little elf suit.

494
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,727
Yeah, my claim to fame.

495
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,431
With the little pompom
on your hat.

496
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,531
Quite the fashion statement.

497
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,600
Yeah, and all that red.
I used to say

498
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,903
I could see you coming
a mile away.

499
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,372
I remember.

500
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,606
Oh, it's so good to see you.

501
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,410
How's your dad? Is he ok?

502
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,378
Yeah, ok enough to want me

503
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,013
To cook this pot roast
I haven't made in years.

504
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,384
Yeah, it's always something.
My family's the same way.

505
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,918
Oh, you have a family.
That's... that's great.

506
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:03,556
Yeah, living the glamorous life
of the soccer mom and loving it.

507
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,359
Roger and I have 3 boys now.

508
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:06,925
Roger...

509
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,126
Oh, Roger Wallace.

510
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,095
Oh, you remember.

511
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,598
Used to read the announcements
in high school.

512
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,835
Oh, yeah. Right.
Roger, with all the...

513
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,669
Oh, that was just an allergy.

514
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,971
His face cleared right up
in college.

515
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,409
He's got his own lumberyard now.

516
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,076
Wow. No kiddin'?

517
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,110
Yeah.

518
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,614
So, are you seeing anybody?

519
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,883
Me? No.

520
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,952
No. Who's got the time?

521
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:33,953
Uh, you know what?

522
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,423
The three of us
should get together for coffee.

523
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:39,526
- Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, oh, don't be silly.

524
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,995
We'll meet you at the inn
tomorrow. 4:00?

525
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,763
How does that sound?

526
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,698
Yeah. Ok. That sounds great.

527
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,068
- Great. It's a date.
- All right.

528
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,037
[Sighs] It seems so long ago.

529
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,440
I mean, I know
it was different for you,

530
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,673
'Cause you had to be there,

531
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,511
But for the rest of us,
it was so special.

532
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,380
I mean, we never missed
a tree lighting ceremony,

533
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,816
And we looked so forward
to the holidays at santaville.

534
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,654
Now it seems nobody
finds the time anymore.

535
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:11,123
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

536
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,658
Yeah.

537
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,860
Yeah.

538
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,763
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

539
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,065
Ok. Bye.

540
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:25,837
Mmm. Peter, was that not
the star on the top of the tree?

541
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,538
That was good.

542
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,708
It was good? It was wonderful.

543
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,209
It was wonderful, holly.

544
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,511
Thanks, dad.

545
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,712
Which reminds me,
we should save a little
somethin' for Earl,

546
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,182
'Cause he's gonna stop by
after his shift.

547
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:36,949
How is Earl?

548
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:37,849
He's doin' well.
He's doin' well.

549
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,218
He's just, uh,
not lawyerin' much anymore,

550
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,188
'Cause he's doin'
double Santa duty,

551
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,558
For us and the mall,
so he's kinda lost interest.

552
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,892
Which is why it's wonderful

553
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,530
That I'm gonna have you around
to help out.

554
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,564
Yeah, dad, about that...

555
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,468
Here. You know,
let me clear some of this away.

556
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:56,636
Mm-hmm.

557
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,440
Dad, I came because I wanted
to make sure that you were ok.

558
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,476
I appreciate that, honey.
I really do.

559
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:05,478
But I can't stay.

560
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,847
Well, I didn't think
you were movin' back home.

561
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,549
I figured you'd leave
right after Christmas.

562
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,083
N...

563
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm not staying for Christmas.

564
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:15,855
What do you mean?

565
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,557
I can stay
for a couple more days,

566
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,193
But I need to get back
to the city, back to my work.

567
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,061
Honey, it's Christmas.

568
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,895
Yeah. I-it's not
about Christmas, dad.

569
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,065
There are people
who depend on me.

570
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,165
I depend on you.

571
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,467
I... i know, and I'll...
I'll do everything that I can.

572
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:33,139
I'll hire someone to
help you out until you
get back on your feet.

573
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,175
I'm not gonna have
some stranger in my house.

574
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,276
Holly, we're family,

575
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,278
And family
takes care of family.

576
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,516
Nick, I could handle things
around here,

577
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,716
The... with the cooking,
the cleaning.

578
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,554
You hear that?
With him cookin',
I could starve to death.

579
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:50,557
I'm glad you're home, honey.
But it reminds me

580
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,258
Earl is not gonna
make the Turkey this year.

581
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,092
Holly's here.

582
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,128
- Dad!
- His Turkey's very dry, honey.

583
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,929
Have you
been listening to me?

584
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,865
Yes, honey,
but you're just tired

585
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,500
From the train ride up here,
which reminds me

586
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,268
We'll talk about it
in the morning

587
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,903
When you make
your holiday breakfast.

588
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,707
You're gonna love her scones.

589
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,208
[Sighs]

590
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,644
Welcome home, honey,
and merry Christmas.

591
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,588
[Sighs]

592
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,326
[Cellphone rings]

593
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,327
[Ring]

594
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,061
Hello.

595
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:29,795
- Holly.
- Oh, Mr. Jennings. Hi.

596
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,962
- How's your dad?
- No, he's ok.

597
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:35,266
I-I'll definitely be in the
office next week, no problem.

598
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,335
Well, then you'll be
the only one.

599
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:39,270
I'm havin' my skiis waxed
as we speak,

600
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:43,042
And our clients'll all be
into vacation mode by next week,

601
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,843
Which is what
you should be doing.

602
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,113
Uh, yeah.
I don't need a vacation.

603
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,314
I don't want a vacation.

604
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,584
Which, as I recall,
is exactly what you said

605
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,220
This time last year
and the year before.

606
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,854
Uh, yeah, but I love my work.

607
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,591
There'll be plenty of work
after the holidays.

608
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,958
Meantime, we got you covered.

609
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,961
Look after your dad
and try to enjoy yourself.

610
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,031
Yeah. No, see,
that's the thing. I...

611
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,298
- Give your dad our best.
- No, wait. Mr...

612
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,734
And, holly, merry Christmas.

613
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,038
Wait. No. M-Mr. Jennings.
[Groans]

614
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,807
[Groans]

615
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,316
What?

616
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,295
"Past due." "Urgent."

617
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,030
Dad, what have you been doing?

618
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,868
All these urgent notices,
these bills.

619
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,103
I'm just a little behind,
that's all.

620
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,003
A little behind?

621
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,338
Dad, some of these bills
are 6 months old.

622
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,007
Well, we had
a couple slow years,

623
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,377
A-and I kept up
until my savings ran out.

624
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,844
Why didn't you tell me?

625
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,313
Honey, you have your own life.

626
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:57,116
I'm not gonna trouble you
with my problems.

627
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,950
Besides, it's December,

628
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,287
And that's always
our best month, remember?

629
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,690
They can come after
your assets, dad.

630
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:04,923
Do you know what that means?

631
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,027
Who's gonna do
a thing like that to Santa?

632
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,663
These bills
aren't made out to Santa.

633
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,832
They're made out to Nick Crosby.

634
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,701
You always were a worrier.

635
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,036
Honey, you have to have
a little faith.

636
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,071
Wonderful things
can happen at Christmas.

637
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,442
Well, then you better come up
with a real miracle, dad.

638
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:28,314
Otherwise, this time next year,
there won't be a santaville.

639
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,101
Thank you for seeing me here

640
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,402
On such short notice,
Mr. corwell.

641
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:55,808
Holly, I just wish
we were meeting under
better circumstances.

642
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,244
Around here,
we all love our Santa.

643
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,246
You've known my father
for 30 years.

644
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,115
This bank loaned him the money
to buy the property,

645
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,284
To renovate the buildings,
to create santaville.

646
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,955
You know the economic impact
he's had on the community,

647
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,722
The tourists he's brought in...

648
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:11,523
Of course he has.

649
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,259
I used to take my family
every year.

650
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,996
It was a family tradition.
Now my grandkids,

651
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,298
They've got, like, 500 channels.

652
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,834
What do they care
about santaville?

653
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,270
All the time
and love my father

654
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:27,940
Has put into this town,
that has to mean something.

655
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:28,907
Yes, it does.

656
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:29,942
It means the world

657
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,379
To anyone who remembers
what santaville once was.

658
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,445
But it's still there.

659
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,248
People only drive
through here now

660
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:39,351
Because we're on the way
to the ski lifts.

661
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,321
We're lucky
if they even stop for gas.

662
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,892
Why would they stop
for santaville?

663
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,126
I'm sorry, holly.

664
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,498
I've already extended
your father more credit
than I should have.

665
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,981
Dad!

666
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:57,997
Earl, are you here?

667
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,565
Supposed to be out there
on that sleigh.

668
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,800
Have a heart. I'm freezin'
my bells off out there.

669
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,270
Besides, haven't had
a visitor since lunch.

670
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,538
Well, kids used to play hooky
just to come here in December.

671
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,406
It's the Internet.

672
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,408
They're sending
virtual Christmas cards

673
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,077
And living virtual lives. Hey!

674
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,513
Ran into John corwell
on my way back from the mall.

675
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,615
Says holly was up to see him.

676
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,086
Yeah. She's takin' care of
a couple of things for me.

677
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,020
What kind of things?

678
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,290
She's takin' care of 'em.
She always does.

679
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,359
Nick...

680
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,395
I been your friend,
your lawyer

681
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,497
Since longer
than I can remember.

682
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,297
Whatever's goin' on,

683
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,633
You know I'll help
in any way I can.

684
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,403
I know that, Earl.

685
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:41,974
You don't have 50 grand
stuck in that boot, do you?

686
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,309
$50,000?

687
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,277
It's funny how some numbers
will make the hair

688
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,447
On the back of your neck
stand up.

689
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,215
Earl...

690
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,283
Gonna be all right. Don't worry.

691
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,585
Get back out there.

692
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:01,326
[Clears throat] Ho ho ho!

693
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,271
When I saw that sleigh
upside down

694
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,973
And your dad all catawampus
in the snow,

695
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,410
I'm tellin' you, honey,
my heart stopped.

696
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,114
It was a sweet thought, though.

697
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,984
I'll give him that.

698
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,919
Sleigh ride under a full moon.

699
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,621
Heh. He can be quite the charmer
when he wants to be.

700
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,357
Is there something
I should know about?

701
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,326
Heh. You tell me,
and we'll both know.

702
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,030
He flirts. I flirt back.

703
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,398
Gets us through the day.

704
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,469
Well, thanks for
taking care of him, Ginny.

705
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,404
I know he can be...

706
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,505
Difficult sometimes.

707
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:51,410
He's not so bad, you know,
once you get used to him.

708
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:55,047
And he sure has perked up
since you got home, honey.

709
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,416
Sure.

710
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,920
Sweetheart, is there something
that you wanna talk about?

711
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,722
Oh. No, nothing. I'm fine.

712
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,856
I just, um...

713
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:09,628
You know, I think that my...
My friends are runnin' late.

714
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,429
[Telephone rings]

715
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,166
Well, I'm here
if you ever need me.

716
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,234
Ok?

717
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,504
[Ring]

718
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,308
[Ring]

719
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,110
Santaville inn.

720
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,392
I'm not staring. I swear.

721
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,130
Uh-huh.

722
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,031
But I'm wondering...

723
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:48,067
And I know this'll
sound like a line. Uh...

724
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,501
But do you come here often?

725
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:53,371
Yeah, why would that
sound like a line?

726
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,174
I'm genuinely curious.

727
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,342
You don't look like a local.

728
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,545
Not for a long time.

729
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,980
And you're not exactly
the santaville type yourself.

730
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,485
I am staying here at the inn,
but I'm in from out of town

731
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,320
Visiting an old college friend
and his wife.

732
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,189
I was actually supposed to meet
here at 4:00, but, uh...

733
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:14,293
Your friends wouldn't happen
to be Roger and della Wallace?

734
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,461
How'd you know?

735
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,196
I... i was supposed
to meet them, too.

736
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,398
Wait a second.
Do you think they...

737
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:24,335
Yeah. Yeah, we've been set up,
big time.

738
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,038
Heh heh.
[Cellphone rings]

739
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:28,574
Well, gee,
I wonder who that could be?

740
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,177
- Ben, is that you?
- Hey, Roger.

741
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,277
Yeah, I'm here.

742
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:33,679
Sorry I can't come.

743
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,513
Oh, no.

744
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,614
Kids have fevers.

745
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:36,615
Fever, huh?

746
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,616
All 3 boys.

747
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,717
All 3 boys.

748
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,319
Wow. That's terrible. I'm sorry.

749
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,820
Say hi to my friend.

750
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,389
Really? What's her name?

751
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,224
Holly Crosby.

752
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,194
Holly Crosby.
That's a pretty name.

753
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,661
What's she look like?

754
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:50,461
Great.

755
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,064
How good-looking?

756
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:52,731
Exquisite.

757
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:54,265
Wow, that good-lookin', huh?

758
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,167
- Say hi.
- Ok, I will.

759
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,537
Thanks, man.
I'll catch up with you later.

760
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,770
Yeah, later, man.

761
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:00,471
Bye.

762
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,040
He wants me to introduce myself

763
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,477
And explain his sons are sick.
You get the idea.

764
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,579
Yeah. Della.

765
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,081
Hi. I'm Ben Richards.

766
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:11,450
You do not have to do this.

767
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,351
Oh, yes, I do.

768
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:16,187
It would mean so much
to Roger and della.

769
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,757
See over there?

770
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,459
Oh, yeah.

771
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,693
This is incredible.

772
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:26,132
I didn't think places
like this still existed.

773
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,832
They are
an endangered species.

774
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:31,336
And your dad put all this
together himself?

775
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,638
Yeah, pretty much.

776
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,574
I mean,
he was the creative force.

777
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,507
But it was my mom

778
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,310
Who had all the business sense
in the family.

779
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:42,848
I mean, she knew how much he was
into the whole Santa thing,

780
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,253
And... and this way
he could make all those
other kids really happy

781
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,720
And still support his family.

782
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,455
Wow. Heh. You must have had,

783
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,359
Like, the most amazing
childhood on record.

784
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,160
[Chuckles]

785
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,827
I mean,
you grew up in santaville.

786
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:01,532
Uh... heh.
It... it had its moments.

787
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,702
You mind if I ask you

788
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:09,508
How your dad affords to keep
this place open all year round?

789
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:13,278
Um, he can't.

790
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,480
Not anymore.

791
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,714
Oh, yeah? What do you mean?

792
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,617
Oh. Well, look around.

793
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,885
I mean, all these
beautiful buildings,

794
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,254
But there's no people.

795
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,356
Times have changed.

796
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,458
Nobody's interested in
a traditional Christmas anymore.

797
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:30,729
So now he's
in a bit of a pickle.

798
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,299
How bad is it?

799
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,167
He could lose everything.

800
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:38,337
Come on. This is
prime new england property,

801
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,370
Charming little town.

802
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:42,241
I mean, you know
how the world works.

803
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,642
It's gotta be worth somethin'.

804
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,944
Oh. [Scoffs]
Selling is not an option.

805
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,747
Well, what about a loan then?

806
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,184
He couldn't borrow enough
to buy a candy cane.

807
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:56,554
In that case, it sounds to me
like you guys are in need

808
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,590
Of the services
of a good financial advisor.

809
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,160
Sure. I'll just Google one up.

810
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,530
Well, there's a rumor
goin' around

811
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,732
That this new guy,
Ben Richards,

812
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,867
Might know a thing or two.

813
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:10,402
You? Seriously?

814
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,803
I can't promise anything,
but...

815
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,439
I might know some people.

816
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,707
People? What...
What does that mean?

817
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:19,911
Just means I can make
a couple of phone calls.

818
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:20,945
If you'd like.

819
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:21,980
Are you kidding?

820
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,381
Yes. Um, please.

821
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,352
Gosh, i... i am in
way over my head here.

822
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:30,821
Anything you could do for...
I just... i would be so...

823
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,858
Thank you.

824
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,362
You're welcome, holly.

825
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,868
Dad!

826
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,379
[Creak]

827
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,011
Oh.

828
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:54,913
Sorry. I... i...

829
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:55,881
No, that's ok.

830
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,284
I was looking for my father.

831
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:01,253
I think he's in the house.

832
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,554
Is this yours?

833
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,424
It's just a hobby.

834
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:09,361
No. They're...
They're beautiful.

835
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,095
Thank you.

836
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,862
Does my father
know about this?

837
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,865
- I would say probably.
- Probably?

838
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,536
Well, I leave one
under his tree every year,

839
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,004
But we've never actually
really talked about it.

840
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,574
I have noticed he makes a point
never to come back here.

841
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:27,512
Think he still wants
to believe in the magic.

842
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,920
Have you ever considered
marketing these?

843
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:40,392
I mean, you just don't find this
kind of craftsmanship anymore.

844
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,397
Like I said, just a hobby.

845
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,301
Well, you must
really like nutcrackers.

846
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:53,070
Someone told me a story
about the ballet
a long time ago.

847
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,673
Been hooked ever since.

848
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,008
Clara, Fritz,

849
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,946
Herr drosselmeyer.

850
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,420
Peter...

851
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,956
Hi.

852
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,393
You make things.

853
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,462
Yeah.

854
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,701
You just left.

855
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,606
I came back.

856
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,477
Yeah.

857
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:40,452
I... i really have to
go find my father.

858
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,620
Can we talk later?

859
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,823
Sure.

860
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,561
So I'll just see you.

861
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,931
Ok.

862
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,084
So, Morgan, you've been
a good little girl all year?

863
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,119
You've got a chimney?

864
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:15,854
Good.

865
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,723
You've got a list.

866
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:18,756
Tiara.

867
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,860
Ok, we might have
a little trouble with the pony,

868
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,062
But a charm bracelet, yeah,
red scooter,

869
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,033
Makeup set.

870
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,039
Dad.

871
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,172
Well?

872
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:36,007
Well, what?

873
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,576
Well, what's the plan
with corwell?

874
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,079
Oh. There's no plan.
He couldn't help us.

875
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:41,947
What do you mean?

876
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,649
W... you're mortgaged
to the hilt, dad.

877
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,116
The bank's in line
with everyone else.

878
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:46,885
What did you expect?

879
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,454
I... i expected
a little loyalty,

880
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,889
Maybe a little faith
in an old friend.

881
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:51,722
Doesn't work that way.

882
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,525
Then what are
we gonna do about it?

883
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,994
I met someone today,
a financial advisor.

884
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,465
A financial advisor.
That's good. That's good. Yeah.

885
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,066
He's gonna try to help us.

886
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,400
Try? He's...
Wh-what does "try" mean?

887
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,670
I don't know, dad.
50 grand's a lot of money.

888
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,637
I'm... I'm sorta wingin' it here.

889
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,974
Well, we gotta figure out
somethin', holly.

890
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,442
You have to stop this.
You have to!

891
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:12,744
Yeah, I know, dad. I get it.

892
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,481
You're a wonderful man,
and this is your life,

893
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,717
And the clock is ticking,
but maybe if you hadn't lived

894
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,619
In such a blissful
state of denial for so long...

895
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,490
Do I look blissful to you?!
Is this blissful?!

896
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:27,158
Holly, I'm trying
to save my home, our home,

897
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,461
And I thought
you cared about that.

898
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:30,796
I do care, dad, but...

899
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,732
But see, that's the thing.
There is no buts, ever.

900
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,534
You're either in, or you're out.

901
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,867
That's the way it works.

902
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,804
This is everything your mother
and I ever worked for,

903
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,642
And if I lose santaville,
then I have nothing.

904
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,777
Nothing.

905
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,483
You have me!

906
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,521
[Groans]

907
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,994
Holly.

908
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,230
Ben. Hi.

909
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,198
I was just comin' to find you.

910
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,837
You do know
it's December, right?

911
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,071
What is it?

912
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,072
I wanted to tell you
right away.

913
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,575
I made those phone calls
I was tellin' you about.

914
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,645
I don't know.
This never happens.

915
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,579
What?

916
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,514
I don't wanna
get your hopes up too much,

917
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:25,283
But these people
are very interested.

918
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:26,084
Seriously?

919
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:26,884
It's incredible.

920
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,753
They got great ideas,
very creative.

921
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,521
Well, tell me.

922
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,557
No, I don't wanna say
too much.

923
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,225
It's very fluid,
and I don't wanna jinx it.

924
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,161
We'll call 'em in the morning.

925
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,062
Oh, come on, Ben.

926
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:37,763
Not until I'm sure.

927
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,229
Think of it like having to wait

928
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:42,100
Until Christmas Eve
to open your presents.

929
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:45,036
Wait. You open your presents
on Christmas Eve?

930
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,104
Sure.

931
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,138
What?

932
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,840
No, it's just that Santa
comes on Christmas Eve.

933
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,308
The presents
are for Christmas morning.

934
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,278
Ok. I'll remember that
from now on,

935
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,245
But the point
is I may have just found

936
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,915
That Christmas miracle
you've been hopin' for.

937
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,785
Thank you so much.

938
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,520
Oh! This is gonna be great.

939
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,592
Thank you, Ben.

940
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,848
Covered bridge.

941
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,201
Hey.

942
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,170
Hi.

943
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,639
I got your note.

944
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:56,341
Great.

945
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,245
My mom used to bring me here

946
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,247
When things would get
a little too crazy.

947
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,951
Sometimes we wouldn't even talk.
We'd just listen to the water.

948
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:09,220
I'd be all geeked out
about something or other,

949
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,724
And that sound
would be so relaxing.

950
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:17,628
She told me stories, and...
And we'd laugh, and...

951
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:22,167
Yeah, and then I'd just forget
what was even bothering me.

952
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,402
She always knew just what to do.

953
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,838
She sounds like
a great person.

954
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,006
She was.

955
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,610
Nick never talks about her.

956
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,613
Ah, you noticed.

957
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:39,349
None of my business.

958
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,794
When I was little,
family was his whole life...

959
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:50,395
Me and my mom.

960
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,164
When she died, he changed.

961
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,299
I was 12.

962
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:57,669
It's like the only way
he could hang on

963
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:00,971
Was to go all Santa
all the time.

964
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,875
A heart big enough
to hold the whole world,

965
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:10,314
But when it came
to his real family, me, well...

966
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,249
So you left.

967
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,652
Yep.

968
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:20,759
That day in the toy shop,
why'd you disappear like that?

969
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,393
My parents were in a hurry.

970
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:26,331
We, uh, still had a long drive
ahead of us.

971
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,398
Visiting relatives?

972
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,034
Back to school.

973
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,036
No, wait.
I-it was Christmas break.

974
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,102
Everyone was out of school.

975
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,340
Yeah, well, they kept
the dorms open just in case.

976
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:36,573
In case of what?

977
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:39,745
In case your parents wanted to
fly to Europe for the holidays

978
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:42,347
And taking you along didn't
exactly fit into their plans.

979
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,952
Your parents left you in
boarding school over Christmas?

980
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,287
On the plus side, I got a lot
of extra studying done,

981
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,191
Which meant I graduated early,
moved to college,

982
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,325
Which really simplified

983
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,295
Mom and dad's plans
for the world cruise.

984
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,898
That must have been awful.

985
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,700
No. It was...
It was normal to me.

986
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,369
Mmm...

987
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,037
Actually all worked out.

988
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:09,074
I went to college
for, like, a decade,

989
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,275
Got several degrees,

990
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:15,113
And then dad tried to squeeze me
into his world of business.

991
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,747
I rebelled, he cut me off,

992
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:20,918
So I decided to do
some traveling of my own.

993
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:24,322
I remembered a certain elf

994
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,258
With a love of the ballet.

995
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,794
Here I am.

996
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:30,896
You came back here
because of me?

997
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:34,900
That and Christmas
365 days a year.

998
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:36,334
[Laughs]

999
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:43,173
I would have traded places
with you in a heartbeat.

1000
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:48,279
Believe me, it wasn't all
candy canes and sleigh rides.

1001
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,080
Ah, it doesn't have to be,

1002
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,418
As long as you have
someone who loves you

1003
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:56,186
And wants you to be happy,

1004
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,523
And that's
what you had here, holly.

1005
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,326
It's what you still have here.

1006
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,995
It's all I ever wanted.

1007

[Ring]

1012
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,311

Holly.

1014
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,113
Ben, hi.

1015
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,323
Tellin' you, holly,
I've never seen a deal
close this quickly.

1016
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:37,428
I mean, those folks are
even willin' to pay off
all your father's bills,

1017
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,363
Wipe the slate clean.

1018
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,430
That's a lot of money.

1019
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:42,934
Aw, 50 or 60 grand,
small change to these people.

1020
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:45,003
Well, it's a fortune
around here.

1021
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,337
What do they get out of it?

1022
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,573
Well, the timing
couldn't have been more perfect.

1023
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,807
These guys just quietly
closed a deal

1024
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:53,177
For controlling interest in 2
ski resorts just north of here,

1025
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,213
And the way they see it,
santaville's just another way

1026
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,281
To draw more families
to the area.

1027
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,150
You know, stop here
on the way up, on the way back.

1028
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,286
You know, some kind of
package deal, maybe,

1029
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,489
Free lift tickets
with every park pass,

1030
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:05,290
Somethin' like that.

1031
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,324
Yeah, that could...
That could work.

1032
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,126
And after all, Roger's been
tellin' me for years

1033
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,261
This little burg
is about to explode, so...

1034
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:16,067
And anyway, point is your dad's
not hangin' in the wind anymore.

1035
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,235
He's got partners now.

1036
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,338
Oh, he won't let anyone
tell him how to run this place.

1037
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,306
Oh, no, no, no.
Silent partners. Absolutely.

1038
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,442
Don't worry.
Your dad's still the man.

1039
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:29,881
[Sighs] It sounds perfect.
Thank you.

1040
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:32,217
Think he'll go for it?

1041
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,386
How could he say no?

1042
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,255
No. I've never needed anyone's
help to run this place

1043
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:42,592
Besides holly and her mother,
and I don't intend to start now.

1044
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,261
It's a good deal, Mr. Crosby.

1045
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,197
It's better than you'll find
anyplace else.

1046
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,232
I need money, not partners.

1047
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,600
Silent partners, dad.
You'd still be in charge.

1048
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:54,372
Oh, and how would these silent
partners get their money back?

1049
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,306
They do want
their money back, right?

1050
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,410
Aw, eventually, of course,
and with fair market interest,

1051
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:02,279
But not until
you're back on your feet.

1052
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:07,351
But in the meantime,
they'd own a piece of my home.

1053
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,286
Technically that's true.

1054
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,319
But it would better
than losing your home,

1055
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,489
Which is what'll happen
if you don't do this soon.

1056
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,523
Not interested.

1057
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,625
At least read it.

1058
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,962
I don't have to read it.
I know exactly what it says.

1059
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,397
It's a lot of legal words
that boils down to one thing.

1060
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,068
You gave up
on santaville years ago,
and you're doin' it again.

1061
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,669
Gave up?
Dad, I went to college.

1062
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:27,371
I got a job, a career.

1063
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,440
Right, and you were
supposed to come back here

1064
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:32,944
And be my number one elf
and help me run this place.

1065
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:36,380
I mean, that... that's all
I ever really was to you,

1066
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,247
Just some silly mascot

1067
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,052
Dressed up in a costume
all these years.

1068
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,220
You know better than that.

1069
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,956
How would I know?

1070
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,356
When did you ever tell me?

1071
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:52,197
Since mom died,
when did you once say to me...

1072
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:00,705
Good day, Ben.

1073
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:16,486
You are a damn fool,
Nick Crosby.

1074
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,025
Shut up.

1075
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,743
[Vehicle approaching]

1076
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,087
Heard you were leaving.

1077
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,689
Without saying good-bye?

1078
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,323
Good-bye, Peter.

1079
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,325
You know, sometimes people

1080
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,129
Don't know how
to say what they feel.

1081
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:00,397
The words just won't come out.

1082
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,000
Talk about everything
except what...

1083
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,436
Really matters to him the most.

1084
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:09,207
Yeah.

1085
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,075
Yeah, it's funny.

1086
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,310
I always thought
I was a great listener.

1087
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,180
I mean, I got 30 years
experience, so I ought to be.

1088
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:20,051
Turns out I'm great at listenin'
to everyone but you,

1089
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:22,387
And I'm really sorry, holly,

1090
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,653
And I wanna fix that.

1091
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:27,357
I just wanted you
to be my dad.

1092
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,360
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

1093
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,097
But you were always so busy

1094
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,399
Being jolly and merry
for everybody else,

1095
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,567
Always Santa.

1096
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,670
Well, maybe that's 'cause
it's easier to live in a world

1097
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:43,308
Where wishes do come true, ok,
where everybody is happy,

1098
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,675
Where nobody ever leaves me.

1099
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:47,245
I couldn't live
in that world, dad,

1100
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,815
Pretending like the past
never happened.

1101
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,517
I still miss her all the time.

1102
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,385
So do i. So do I, honey.

1103
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:59,356
But you never talk about her.
It's like she was never here.

1104
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,425
She was here.

1105
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,796
Some days, I think she still is,

1106
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,433
Because I can see her.

1107
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,303
I can see her in your eyes,
your smile.

1108
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:16,506
And when you laugh,
I can hear her.

1109
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:21,345
She's been here a lot
these last few days.

1110
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,183
Really?

1111
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,153
Yeah.

1112
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:31,788
It's a wonderful thing
havin' you come back home.

1113
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:35,325
I miss you, too, dad,

1114
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,494
So much.

1115
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,304
Please don't leave,
honey, not yet.

1116
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:02,887
Mmm, scones.

1117
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,623
You know, i... i thought about
what you said last night

1118
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,493
About how I never
talked about your mother.

1119
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:10,227
Dad, you don't have to.

1120
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,295
No, no, no. You're right.

1121
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,664
You're right. I haven't,
and it's very selfish of me,

1122
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:17,567
Because she was
an amazing woman.

1123
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:19,469
I remember.

1124
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:21,939
But there's a lot
you don't remember,

1125
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:26,311
And I want you to.
Important things.

1126
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,213
So...

1127
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:32,817
I figured it was about time
we opened this up.

1128
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,851
Go ahead.

1129
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,694
Dad...

1130
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:49,667
In here is every letter,
card, and note

1131
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,635
Your mom ever sent to me.

1132
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:56,406
I mean, a lot of the notes
are silly.

1133
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:57,308
I saved everything.

1134
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,777
"I'll always love you,"
and stuff that...

1135
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,180
She'd sneak in my pants
in the morning, and...

1136
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,715
Then I'd find it later.

1137
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,651
Uh, she was funny.

1138
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:12,356
Oh, and this is the first
Christmas card we ever made you.

1139
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,457
Remember?

1140
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:15,392
Ah.

1141
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,294
Oh, and there's pictures.

1142
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,230
Remember when
you won the spelling bee?

1143
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:23,501
You were in the third grade, and
you beat the sixth graders. Huh?

1144
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:28,338
And this is your mom and I's
first date.

1145
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,606
Fancy.

1146
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:34,312
And this is from our honeymoon,
when we went to wisconson dales.

1147
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:39,516
Lot of people go to Vegas, but
not good enough for your mom.

1148
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,387
Oh, and this.

1149
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:46,956
The night I asked her
to marry me...

1150
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,361
I gave her this ring.

1151
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:55,333
And our wedding rings
are in here, too.

1152
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,534
And I want you to have this,

1153
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,537
And maybe one day...

1154
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,240
You'll need 'em.

1155
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,614
And then there's this.

1156
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:17,421
Mistletoe?

1157
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:21,359
This is from the first night
I met your mom.

1158
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,829
My friends were havin' a party,
and I almost didn't go,

1159
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:27,432
But I did,
and I walked in the door,

1160
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:33,270
And I saw your mom
standing in the moonlight
under the mistletoe.

1161
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,408
Moonlight and mistletoe.

1162
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,675
Yeah.

1163
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,779
And so, I don't know
what got into me,

1164
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,482
But I went right up
and kissed her.

1165
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:45,916
And it could've gone either way,

1166
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:50,355
'Cause your mom was
very beautiful, and I was, uh...

1167
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:51,254
Me...

1168
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:55,759
But as luck would have it,
it went my way,

1169
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,529
And about a year later,
you were born.

1170
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,433
That must have been some kiss.

1171
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:03,300
I think she thought so.

1172
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,805
And that's why you never
forget to hang the mistletoe.

1173
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,708
Yeah. Well, there was
a lot of Christmas magic

1174
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,476
In the air that night for me.

1175
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:16,012
We all need a little
Christmas magic once in a while.

1176
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:19,350
And if the mistletoe helps,
I figure, "why not?"

1177
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:22,952
You might need some
one day, too, so...

1178
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,055
But that's me. I'm just...

1179
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:28,559
Probably just
a romantic old fool.

1180
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,398
Anyway, I want you to...

1181
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:34,699
Take care of her.

1182
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,066
I will.

1183
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,668
And you're not old. Heh.

1184
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,771
I know. And I was thinkin'
about that other thing,

1185
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:46,043
About the contract, and if
you think it's a good thing,

1186
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:47,577
I'll sign it.

1187
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:49,046
You mean it?

1188
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:49,947
Yeah.

1189
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,482
You're very smart, holly.

1190
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:52,383
You're like your mom.

1191
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,819
And it's time
I started listening to you.

1192
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,888
You won't regret it, dad.

1193
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,123
I know. I know.

1194
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:03,360
And I got Earl lookin' at all
the legal mumbo jumbo right now.

1195
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,662
Everything's gonna be ok.
I promise.

1196
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,565
I know, holly.

1197
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,537
I know.

1198
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,449
There you go.

1199
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,015
Thanks, Ginny.

1200
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,625
[Sighs]

1201

[Door opens, bell rings]

1202
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:50,074
Decide to stay?

1203
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:52,510
Yeah.

1204
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,445
I'm glad.

1205
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,482
I, uh, noticed

1206
00:56:57,515 --> 00:57:00,685
That you've been working
in here all morning,

1207
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:04,522
And I thought
you might like hot coffee.

1208
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:05,556
[Toy train whistle blows]

1209
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,592
Oh. You read my mind.

1210
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,598
I wanted to thank you

1211
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,466
For being there last night.

1212
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:18,002
I didn't do anything.

1213
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:22,205
No, you have a way of
simplifying the truth.

1214
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,708
What you said really helped.

1215
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:28,845
For the first time in years,
dad and I actually talked.

1216
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,449
He even agreed
to sign the contract.

1217
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:35,720
So everything works out.

1218
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:38,222
He gets to keep santaville,
and, uh...

1219
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:41,758
You get to go back to the city.

1220
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,229
Yeah.

1221
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:49,567
I was planning on taking
the sleigh out tonight.

1222
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,469
Why don't you come with me.

1223
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,939
Uh, I'd like to,
but I'm meeting Ben.

1224
00:57:55,973 --> 00:58:00,010
He has to get the contract
to his people right away.

1225
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:03,212
Mmm.
Maybe I should get people.

1226
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:05,248
Makes you sound more important.

1227
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:08,519
The investors, ok?

1228
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,787
What's the rush?

1229
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,289
They need to get
this deal together

1230
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,323
Before the end
of the quarter,

1231
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,826
Or else their tax liability
on the money doubles.

1232
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,260
And we can't have that.

1233
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:20,531
You really
don't like business, do you?

1234
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:21,732
Been there.

1235
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,266
[Toy train whistle blows]

1236
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,269
I prefer sleigh rides.

1237
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,507
Maybe another time.

1238
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:32,208
Sure.

1239
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,612
I'm not goin' anywhere.

1240
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,135
Ok, now where does this go?

1241
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:00,870
Um, on the top, Earl...

1242
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,073
- Oh.
- Where it always goes...

1243
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:03,540
Every year. Yeah. Yeah.

1244
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,711
Try not to swallow
this one whole, Nick Crosby.

1245
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:09,046
Ooh. Pie.

1246
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,280
You act like I'm made of pies.

1247
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,283
Well, see, that's our secret.

1248
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:16,185
You make the pies,
and I eat the pies.

1249
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,055
- [Scoffs]
- It's like words and music.

1250
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,591
We belong together,
you know,

1251
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,593
Like hot and toddy.

1252
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:28,232
Only Santa could get away with
a line like that. Mmm.

1253
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,966
Wow. Look at you.

1254
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,001
You look great, honey.

1255
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,269
Thank you.

1256
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,371
Somebody's got a hot date.

1257
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:37,608
No, it's not a date.
I'm just meeting Ben for dinner

1258
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:39,343
To look over the paperwork.

1259
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:44,013
Um, speaking of which, Earl,
do you have the contract?

1260
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,250
Uh, yeah.

1261
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:46,950
Yeah.

1262
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:47,852
Anything I should know about?

1263
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:52,857
Um, n-no, it's all
pretty standard stuff.

1264
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,625
I-it seems fine to me.

1265
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:57,094
Great. Dad, do you have a pen?

1266
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,328
Mm-hmm. Course I have a pen.

1267
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:01,231
Heh. [Stammers]

1268
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:02,633
I'll go get one.

1269
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:03,600
Ok, you get it.

1270
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,370
Usually have a pen.

1271
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,976
Wow. I'm impressed.

1272
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:14,744
I thought your dad
threw in the towel.

1273
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,146
Christmas is a time
for miracles.

1274
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:20,083
Heh. I'm gonna remember that
from now on.

1275
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,385
I can't thank you enough, Ben.

1276
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:25,355
I mean, I feel like
this enormous weight

1277
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:28,192
Has been lifted
off my shoulders.

1278
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,226
Was happy to do it.

1279
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,094
For the first time in years,

1280
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,898
I'll be able to enjoy
the holiday with my father,

1281
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,266
And it's because of you.

1282
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,001
[Scoffs] I can't take
all the credit.

1283
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,238
I mean, you're the one
that sold him on the idea.

1284
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,105
Remember that.

1285
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,039
And let's not forget
our silent partners.

1286
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,243
They're the ones puttin' up
all that money.

1287
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:47,344
I know,

1288
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:50,848
But still, I want you to know
how much it means to me.

1289
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,218
And I was thinking
if you're not too busy,

1290
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:58,322
Maybe you wanna celebrate
Christmas here with dad and me.

1291
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:02,827
We could have della and... and
Roger and their... and their...

1292
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,062
Holly, you ok?

1293
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:09,299
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1294
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,466
It's just...

1295
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,805
A minute ago, you said,
"our silent partners."

1296
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,141
No. Did I?

1297
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,341
That's weird. Sorry.

1298
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,377
Guess I just got caught up
in the moment.

1299
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,848
Your silent partners, obviously.

1300
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,049
But semantics aside,

1301
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:29,018
I would be honored to join you
and your father for Christmas.

1302
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,319
Really? Great.

1303

[Cellphone rings]

1304
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,256
Oh. I'm sorry.

1305
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:35,158
Speaking of partners,
this is them right now.

1306
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,462
Better go give them
the good news. You excuse me?

1307
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,230
Yes. Yes. Go. Go.

1308
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,398

1310
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:47,304
Don't leave.

1311
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:50,307
Guess what.

1312
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,176
I got the signed contract
right here in my pocket.

1313
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,043
You did it, Ben. Great.

1314
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,145
I know.
I couldn't believe it either.

1315
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,784
I thought we were
dead in the water, bro.

1316
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,720
Oh, hi. You know,
he's still on the...

1317
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,390
You know what? Just leave it.
I'll go find him.

1318
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:10,960
Of course it's in there
exactly the way you wrote it.

1319
01:02:10,995 --> 01:02:11,694
You're jokin'.

in black and white

- I don't know.

legalese you came up with.

This is working just like it
did in killington, man.

[Sighs] Yeah, right.
That and my charm, of course.

I'm so sorry, dad.

1335

I wanted this so much for you,
and I let my guard down.

1336
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,433
You gotta
give yourself a break.

1337
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:50,566
You didn't know, honey.

1338
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:51,567
I should have known.

1339
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,103
I should have never
trusted him.

1340
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,341
Honey, you can't blame
yourself for trusting people.

1341

He rode in
on his big white horse,

1342
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,412
And I bought the whole act,
no questions asked.

1343
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,280
He's a total pro.

1344
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:03,780
He's done it before.

1345
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,417
Holly, it was not your fault.

1346

- Earl, please.
- No.

1347
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:10,354
If I had read the contract

1348
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,322
Like I was supposed to,
like you asked...

1349
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:14,457
Earl, stop.

1350
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,960
I don't know what it is.
I just... i can't seem to focus.

1351
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,495
You don't have to explain
yourself to anyone.

1352
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:20,563
I'd read a paragraph.

1353
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:24,401
I couldn't remember where I was,
what I'd just read.

1354

You're the last person to know
that you've lost your touch.

Earl, look,
it's not your fault.

1357
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:39,782
You got it?

1358
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,251
This is not your fault.
It's my fault.

1359
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:46,390
It's my name on that contract.
I signed it.

1360
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,156
Ok?

1361
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,327
I should have read
the fine print.

1362
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,629
It seems to me we should
stop worrying about
who's to blame here

1363
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:57,266
And start talkin' about
what are we gonna do about it?

1364
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,035
Exactly.

1365
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,870
Except that I signed
the contract,

with this sort of thing?

Well, it's not right.

01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:22,426

and I'm not gonna let him do it.

I was helping you.

lost santaville yet,

without a fight.

01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:30,393
On a night like this,
it's no way to live life.

1396
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,262
You didn't see
my father's face.

1397
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:37,001
I'm not feeling very sympathetic
towards Ben at the moment.

1398
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,637
Maybe he'll reconsider,
tear up the contract.

1399
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:41,270
Never,

1400
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,372
And he's got the only copy.

1401
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:46,576
Fat chance I'll get
another look at it.

1403
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:50,547
How am I gonna get $50,000?

1404
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,717
Just have to bring
more visitors to santaville,

1405
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,318
A lot more.

1406
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,088
Christmas is less
than 3 weeks away.

1407
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:03,359
We haven't had that many
visitors in the past 5 years.

1408
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,262
Besides,
people came to santaville

1409
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,331
Because they wanted to.

1410
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:10,334
It meant something to them.

1411
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:11,301
Della said so.

1412
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:15,104
Even Mr. corwell called it
a family tradition.

1413
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,341
They remember what it was like.

1414
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:19,543
Mmm. It hasn't changed
that much.

1415
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,777
No, it hasn't.

1416
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:23,347
Times have changed,

1417
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,083
But they still remember.

1418
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,352
Everybody remembers.

1419
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:31,687
The whole town remembers.

1420
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,791
They remember what santaville
used to be,

1421
01:06:34,823 --> 01:06:39,228
Because it's the way
they want it to be.

1422
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,397
You're right.

1423
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,270
If we could find a way
to show them

1424
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:51,508
That it's not all in the past,
that santaville is still here,

1425
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:55,344
That it's still
just the way they remember...

1426
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,446
They'd come back.

1427
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:00,449
They'd come back.

1428
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,522
Yeah.

1429
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:09,393
Yeah. I don't get this.
What's it called again?

1430
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:10,459
It's a blog, dad.

1431
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,098
It's like a journal,
but you write it on our website.

1432
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,065
We have to get the word out,

1433
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,368
Not just to the town,
but everywhere.

1434
01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:20,469
Yeah, but what
do I write about?

1435
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,737
You write about Santa's day,

1436
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,373
You know, like... like toys
and reindeer and elves.

1437

It was brilliant.

get the word out, folks.

We gotta make people
remember this.

1461
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:38,347
Uh, how are we gonna do that?

I think I'll be bloggin'.

the mistletoe.

on our mind, honey.

would understand.

about Ginny.

though.

01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,140
There's no reason
you and your father

1571
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,777
Have to walk away
from this empty-handed, ok?

1572
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,212
[Scoffs] Are you...
Are you trying to bribe me?

1573
01:13:36,244 --> 01:13:38,647
No. That's not what I meant.

1574
01:13:38,682 --> 01:13:40,883
We must have you
really nervous, Ben.

1575
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:41,784
What's the matter?

1576
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,020
Afraid you're gonna lose
your finder's fee?

1577
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:47,056
Heh. Was just tryin'
to do you a favor.

1578
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,825
Yeah, I've had enough
of your favors.

1579
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,561
This place is my home.

1580
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:55,565
Your heartless soul
isn't welcome here anymore.

1581
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,165
Get out.

1582
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,069
You can't win this, holly.

1583
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:04,440
You know that.

1584
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,752
I was out there
with my grandkids,

1585
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,219
And we had a wonderful time.

1586
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,622
They just loved it.
It was so magical.

1587
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:20,490
That's great, Mr. corwell,

1588
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:22,559
Because we're
kind of in a crunch here.

1589
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,562
Mr. Richards came by
to introduce himself
to me a few days ago.

1590
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,663
Then I don't need to tell you
what's at stake.

1591
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:30,567
If you could use the money
we've made so far

1592
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:31,968
As a kind of good-faith payment

1593
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,003
To secure the rest
of what we need...

1594
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:36,506
You've deposited
nearly $28,000,

1595
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,607
And that's very impressive,

1596
01:14:37,641 --> 01:14:41,077
But it still leaves you
with a substantial debt load.

1597
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,911
People are coming
from all over.

1598
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,947
We still have 4 days
before Christmas.

1599
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,617
And then there's January,
which as you know,

1600
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:50,119
Is the slowest month
for any holiday business.

1601
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,888
This property has been
the lifeblood of my family.

1602
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:56,626
My father cannot lose this.
I won't let it happen.

1603
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,528
I'm sorry, holly.

1604
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:01,164
I am, too.

1605
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:03,132
I forgot how great it was

1606
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,302
To have all those little
smilin' faces runnin' around.

1607
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:10,540
Yeah. It really brought
the old place back to life.

1608
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:12,275
Turns out people do remember

1609
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:15,277
With a little help
from your awesome plan.

1610
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:18,882
Oh. Well, we... we wouldn't have
gotten anywhere without Peter.

1611
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:22,686
Yeah. You and Peter
make a good team.

1612
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:27,390
I read your blog.

1613
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,958
Today was really sweet,
the way the encouraged the kids

1614
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:31,927
To give a toy to a needy child.

1615
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,097
Yeah. Yeah,
it was sweet and...

1616
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,198
Took a long time.

1617
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,666
You know, that reminds me,

1618
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,234
Uh, all the kids are back now,

1619
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:41,003
A-and they've all got
long lists for Santa,

1620
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,271
And Santa's busy,
and he was wondering

1621
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:46,942
If maybe his daughter could
take over the blog and...

1622
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:47,811
For a little while.

1623
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,613
Don't you mean
Santa's number-one elf?

1624
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:50,478
No. Santa has a daughter,

1625
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:54,217
And it's time the world
got to know her.

1626
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:56,753
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

1627
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,122
Ok, dad,
why don't you go to bed.

1628
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:00,923
I'll... i can finish up here.

1629
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,925
Well...

1630
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:03,491
Ok.

1631
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:04,560
- Ok.
- Night, honey.

1632
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,295
Good night.

1633
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:13,168
[Sighs]

1634
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,171
This doesn't even come close
to what we owe.

1635
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,375
I have a little bit of savings,
some equity in my condo.

1636
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,277
I could take out
a second mortgage, but...

1637
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,278
It's not enough.

1638
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:24,980
Talk to Nick about that?

1639
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,150
Yeah, you know what he'd say.

1640
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:29,085
And he'd be right.

1641
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,319
Excuse me?

1642
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:33,256
It is my money.
I can do what I want with it,

1643
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:37,160
And I am not gonna
let these people take my home.

1644
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:39,629
Heh.

1645
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:42,632
What are you smiling at?

1646
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,066
Nothin'.

1647
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,804
It's just that you said,
"my home,"

1648
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,972
Not "his," "my."

1649
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,175
You know what I mean.

1650
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,810
I know up until
a couple weeks ago,

1651
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,680
You couldn't wait to take
the first train out of here.

1652
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:59,982
Let's not make a big deal
about this, ok?

1653
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:01,083
I am still going home.

1654
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:04,620
I'm just tired
and worried about my dad,

1655
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,856
And I misspoke.

1656
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,158
Of course.

1657
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,060
Why do you keep making those?

1658
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,698
Don't you have enough already?

1659
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,002
I like it.

1660
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,437
It's what I do,

1661
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:23,271
Who I am.

1662
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,979
Take this piece of wood.

1663
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:35,819
Who would ever guess
that somewhere hidden in here

1664
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:36,786
Is the charming prince

1665
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:41,023
Who will save Clara
from the evil mouse king?

1666
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:42,891
Yeah, I know the story.

1667
01:17:42,926 --> 01:17:49,131
And all you have to do
is find him and let him out.

1668
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,267
You make it sound so easy.

1669
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,201
It is.

1670
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:54,871
Eh, see how rough it is?

1671
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:59,275
Sand it down,
always going with the grain.

1672
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:04,012
And once you've made it
completely smooth...

1673
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,883
You decide on a face.

1674
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:09,252
How do you decide?

1675
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:10,853
You just know.

1676
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:16,059
It's a face you wanna look at
for the rest of your life.

1677
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:20,196
That would be a nice face.

1678
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,000
A very nice face.

1679
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:35,911
Peter! Are you in there?!

1680
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:37,781
Ah, there you are.

1681
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:38,347
Hi, holly.

1682
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:39,315
Peter, I'm so sorry.

1683
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:42,251
I just stepped out for a minute.
I didn't know.

1684
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:44,019
Know what? Wh-what's wrong?

1685
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,453
Well, there was
a customer in the bar,

1686
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,455
And he just fell in love
with your nutcracker,

1687
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:48,957
And he told Chuck
he totally had to have it,

1688
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:53,528
So Chuck named a price
that he thought was gonna be
way too crazy for anybody,

1689
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:56,399
And the guy just bought it.

1690
01:18:58,267 --> 01:18:59,534
Sorry.

1691
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:01,270
For how much?

1692
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:03,306
[Clears throat]

1693
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,414
[Laughs]

1694
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,117
$500?!

1695
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,383
Let me get this straight.

1696
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,353
This guy actually paid
all that money

1697
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:20,355
For one of these little toys?

1698
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,557
They're not toys, Earl.

1699
01:19:21,589 --> 01:19:24,928
They're handcrafted works of art
made by a master craftsman.

1700
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,430
We're still
talkin' about Peter, right?

1701
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:28,396
No offense.

1702
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,397
None taken.

1703
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,034
It's his craftsmanship
that makes them unique.

1704
01:19:32,068 --> 01:19:33,436
Each one is different.

1705
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:34,070
$500 different.

1706
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,572
No, it's like snowflakes.

1707
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:37,406
Exactly.

1708
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,206
We're selling snowflakes,

1709
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,909
And people wanna buy
these snowflakes

1710
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:42,278
So they can make
their own family tradition...

1711
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:44,547
You know,
bring them out every year,

1712
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:45,815
Pass them on to their children.

1713
01:19:45,849 --> 01:19:47,249
Yeah, but these
all belong to Peter,

1714
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,084
And we can't ask him
to do that.

1715
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,086
I wanna do it for you, Nick.

1716
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:51,753
Thank you, Peter.

1717
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,289
But that makes Ginny in charge

1718
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,893
Of my mystery gift under
the tree Christmas morning.

1719
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:59,261
Uh, if you're a good boy.

1720
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,063
[Laughs]

1721
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,998
How many more
of those nutcrackers

1722
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,399
Do you have at the workshop?

1723
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:04,800
[Sighs] I don't know.
40. Maybe more.

1724
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,537
Well, I can set up
a booth where everybody can see.

1725
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,238
And I'm gonna sell 'em
on the website.

1726
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,474
Dad's getting hundreds of hits
on his blog now.

1727
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:13,408
- Yep.
- But we have to move fast,

1728
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:15,278
So we can get these
to people for Christmas.

1729
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,380
So you really think
this is gonna work, honey?

1730
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,214
I really do, dad,

1731
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:21,350
With a little bit
of Christmas magic.

1732
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,355
[Laughs]

1733
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,935
So how we doin'?

1734
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:41,537
I haven't finished
adding up all the sales.

1735
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:44,540
So we're still
not out of the woods.

1736
01:20:44,572 --> 01:20:45,942
Not yet,

1737
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:49,211
But we're close.

1738
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,352
You still have it.

1739
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,355
I looked for it last night.

1740
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:02,290
I found it buried
in my old jewelry box.

1741
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:05,861
I thought
it might bring us luck.

1742
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,367
Maybe a little
Christmas magic?

1743
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:18,006
I can't imagine my life
without santaville.

1744
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,112
Or you.

1745
01:21:24,712 --> 01:21:29,351
It's a face I could look at
for the rest of my life.

1746
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:42,364
What happens if we lose?

1747
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,070
- Holly?
- I've been trying to reach you.

1748
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:50,272
- I just got off the slopes.
- You have to hear this idea.

1749
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,575
I told you to take
some time off this Christmas.

1750
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:56,012
I know, Mr. Jennings,
but this is really important.

1751
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:56,912
Ok. What's up?

1752
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:59,082
I found these
one-of-a-kind nutcrackers.

1753
01:21:59,115 --> 01:21:59,983
Nutcrackers?

1754
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:01,316
Yeah. They're unique.

1755
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:02,585
Really?

1756
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,920
Come and get it!
It's one of a kind.

1757
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,555
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

1758
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,124
Straight from Santa's workshop!

1759
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:10,525
Nutcrackers made
by one of Santa's elves.

1760
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,429
- One of a kind!
- Signed at the bottom.

1761
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,529
Straight
from Santa's workshop!

1762
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,031
- I cannot believe this, Ginny.
- What?

1763
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,434
Just in time,
we're gonna make it.

1764
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:19,534
Oh, honey.

1765
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,105
There are orders coming in
from all over the country,

1766
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,138
Even some from Europe.

1767
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:27,275
Everybody needs Santa,
no matter where they live.

1768
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:31,014
* deck the halls
with boughs of holly *

1769
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:34,050

1777
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:00,743
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1778
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:03,445
Merry Christmas!

1779
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:04,812
Well, everybody,

1780
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,316
It's almost
midnight Christmas Eve,

1781
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,052
So Santa can't talk long,

1782
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,354
'Cause I got
a previous engagement.

1783
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:14,357
You know, you should
really be in bed, too.

1784
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,292
[Scattered laughter]

1785
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,461
Uh, before Santa leaves,

1786
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,396
There's something
I wanna say to you.

1787
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:25,168
I grew up here,
and every memory I have

1788
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:30,673
Is connected to this place
and all of the people in it.

1789
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,076
I went away for a while,

1790
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:34,442
A long while,

1791
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:37,280
Because I was convinced
that all the love

1792
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:41,284
And kindness and generosity that
I remembered from this place

1793
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:44,153
Was a thing of the past.

1794
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:47,156
And I know now how wrong I was,

1795
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,357
Thanks to you...

1796
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:50,458
And all of you.

1797
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:54,597
There still is a place
where people care in this world,

1798
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,498
Where they wanna help.

1799
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,802
And that's why you're all here,

1800
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:02,270
Because you remember, too,

1801
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:06,374
And you wanted to keep
this one magical place

1802
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:08,576
Open for the next generation.

1803
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:09,578
Yeah.

1804
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:10,278
Right.

1805
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:12,448
But we didn't reach our goal,

1806
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,784
So this'll be the last Christmas
for santaville.

1807
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,652
[Moans]

1808
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,323
It was going so well.

1809
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,658
Honey, it's ok. We tried.

1810
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:27,130
We tried really hard,
but we came up a little short.

1811
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:28,463
It's over now.

1812
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:29,798
I love you.

1813
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:33,768
Holly! Holly, wait!

1814
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,271
Mr. Jennings?

1815
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:38,574
Brenda showed me
the santaville website.

1816
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:39,342
The woodcarvings are...

1817
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,443
We think
they're just wonderful.

1818
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,778
And so do our customers.

1819
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:47,415
I wanna make global
handcrafts the exclusive
distributor, holly.

1820
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,352
With you running things
up here,

1821
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:52,188
We could sell 'em
all over the world.

1822
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:53,455
But they're... they're not mine.

1823
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:55,191
Um, Mr. Jennings,
this is Peter lowdell.

1824
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:56,792
He's the artist.
He made all of these.

1825
01:24:56,824 --> 01:24:59,827
Love your work, Peter.
What do you say? You interested?

1826
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:02,330
Well, you know
I carve these by hand.

1827
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:04,267
They don't come from a factory.

1828
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,202
Wouldn't want it
any other way.

1829
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:08,403
And my shop
would have to stay here.

1830
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,472
You could sell them online,

1831
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:12,407
But I wanna make sure
everyone knows that santaville

1832
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,577
Is the only place
you can buy them in person.

1833
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,513
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

1834
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:20,748
Peter, are you sure?

1835
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:26,189
I never would've made them
if it wasn't for this place.

1836
01:25:26,222 --> 01:25:29,891
If it's what you want,
it's what I want.

1837
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,496
Mr. Jennings,
you can tell our customers

1838
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,531
That I'll be
looking after things up here

1839
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:37,532
Personally.

1840
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:38,634
Young man,

1841
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:42,437
I think you're going to be
very busy for quite a while.

1842
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,506
In the meantime,
how many do you have left?

1843
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,542
- Um, none.
- We're... we sold out.

1844
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:51,214
Well, you could
commission one...

1845
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:54,417
For say, $8,000.

1846
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:55,684
Yeah. Is that legal?

1847
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:57,320
You bet it is...

1848
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,887
For another 4 minutes.

1849
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,424
Done.

1850
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:02,590
Yes!

1851
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:03,726
Right!

1852
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:07,562
[Cheering]

1853
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:11,367
Wait.

1854
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,736
Merry Christmas after all.

1855
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:14,936
Merry Christmas.

1856
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,204
Ok.

1857
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,941
[Cheering and applause]

1858
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,449
[Narrating] Christmas was
always different for me.

1859
01:26:27,483 --> 01:26:30,452
It was always better.
I just forgot that for a while.

1860
01:26:30,486 --> 01:26:33,256
Dad and Ginny run santaville
together now.

1861
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:34,656
Peter and I were married there,

1862
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,492
Complete with moonlight
and mistletoe.

1863
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,328
And by the next Christmas,

1864
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:41,697
Santa will have
a new little elf to train.

1865
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:45,334
So don't forget to come and
visit all of us at santaville,

1866
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:47,669
Where every day
truly is Christmas.

1867
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,638
From Santa's
loving daughter, holly.

1868
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:55,344
* ...And a happy new year
