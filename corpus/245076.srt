What do you teach?
You teach... poetry?

90
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,059
You're a Iover,

91
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,760
Good one, Leon. Ah, yeah.

92
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,359

94
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:39,010

98
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,699

110
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,687

Yeah, and how am I supposed
to find the time, Mr. Decker?

123
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,355
I do have more important shit
to worry about right now, okay?

124
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,484
What do you think
of this, pussycat?

125
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,858
Very nice.
What do you think?

126
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,626
Ah, Nice.

127
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,830
Disgusting.

128
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,704
A high schooI.

129
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,369
Who wouId ever suspect
a high schooI?

130
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,606
It's perfect.

131
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,617
Just take the pictures.

132
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,491
You got it?

133
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,625
2,000 a week, pIus medicaI
and profit participation.

134
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,686
Start first thing Monday.

135
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,325
That's great.

136
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,629
I have enough troubIe with students
having sex Iike rabbits.

137
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,432
I don't need teachers
making it worse.

138
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,769
Yeah.

139
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,036
well, as a matter of fact,
you'Ve got a point there, Lyle.

140
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,077
I don't see any other choice
so I'm just going to have to quit.

141
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,907
That's my Ietter of resignation,
effective today.

142
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,606
Excuse me,
I'm Iate for history cIass.

143
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,149
He's joking, right?

144
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:36,154
No. No, he's not.

145
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:41,659
So ultimately, the aerial bombing
campaign by the United States,

146
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,551
faiIed to defeat the north.

147
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,494
Who knows why?

148
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,794
- Man: who the fuck cares?
- Hey. CharIee?

149
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,528
- Ah...
- Why was that cruciaI?

150
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,264
- Sorry, Mr. Decker, I don't know.
- Neither do I, sir.

151
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:57,275
- Why the heII are we taIking about--
- AII right, guys, quiet. Mick?

152
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,468
What's the point? Who gives a shit
about history anyway?

153
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,604
- There it is. See?
- The point is this.

154
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,617
It doesn't matter who has more
soIdiers or more bombs.

155
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:13,591
Whoever is the most committed
to their cause, aIways wins.

156
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,897
- Thank you!
- Okay, guys.

157
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,493
- Thanks a lot.
- AII right, Mick.

158
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,436
AII right, get out of here.
See you in the gym.

159
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:31,340
- I'm open!
- Defense.

160
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,207
Come on, pass it up!
Whoo-hoo!

161
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,940
- I got this.
- What?

162
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,642
Come on, find your zone.

163
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,149
What are you Iooking at?

164
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,116
- A FOG.
- What's a FOG?

165
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:44,213
F-O-G, FuckabIe OIder Guy.

166
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,090
Yeah? Just don't get pregnant.

167
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,287
You're a good teacher, Sam.

168
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,057
The kind we can't afford to lose.

169
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,122
Come on, LyIe,
we don't teach here.

170
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,929
This isn't a schooI,
it's a prison.

171
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,366
We just detain these kids untiI
they're oId enough to graduate

172
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,597
with dipIomas
they can't even read.

173
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:04,041
It's my Iast day.

174
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:09,046
Okay.

175
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,009
Macer's mother's in the hospitaI.

176
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,380
I need someone to fiII in
for his detention cIass.

177
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,850
What?

178
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,386
You're actuaIIy
making me stay after schooI?

179
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,388
WeII, don't think of it
as a punishment.

180
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,219
Think of it as a...
a parting gesture.

181
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,759
Motherfucker!

182
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,226
- Break it up!
- Take him down, Jay Tee.

183
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,284
Okay. Come on,
that's enough. Hey.

184
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,763
That's enough.

185
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,233
AsshoIe threatened to kiII me.
You can expeI him for that.

186
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,328
- What?
- Come on.

187
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,033
- Detention shouId be pIenty.
- What for?

188
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:41,045
You can't stop shit.
I heard you knocked up AIicia.

189
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,711
What happened?
Rubber too big and faII off?

190
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,148
- What?
- That's enough. I said enough.

191
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,879
Hit the showers.
Hey! Go on, hit the showers.

192
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,184
FederaI Agent GIen Prokow,
Secret Service.

193
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,316
As of now, this precinct and aII units
are under my direct controI

194
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,053
during the visit of the vice-president.

195
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,253
What?

196
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,386
BuIIshit.
You don't have the authority.

197
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,430
FederaI Iaw gives me
the authority.

198
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:03,434
Since when?

199
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:10,707
ApriI 15, 1865.
The day after LincoIn was shot.

200
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,006
You gotta be shitting me.

201
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,376
LyIe's reaIIy pissed.

202
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,142
Yeah, I know.

203
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,683
He put me on detention.

204
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,150
Oh.

205
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,982
You know, I think
he actuaIIy Iikes you,

206
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,681
God knows why.

207
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,883
It's not him. It's...

208
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,483
it's this pIace.

209
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,791
I don't know why
you wanna stay.

210
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,092
You know me.

211
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,291
Besides, this pIace
does have some very...

212
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,960
pIeasant memories.

213
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,469
Mr. Decker, I need to see you
in your cIassroom for a moment.

214
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,505
Come on, l'll be late
for detention.

215
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,233
l don't care.

216
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,675
I wanna do it one Iast time
with the teacher.

217
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,405
Oh, girI, what's wrong?
You aII right?

218
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,310
Nothing.
Get out of my face.

219
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,076
Listen, why don't you
come with me?

220
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,050
Some other Iifetime, maybe.

221
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,279
Come on, girI, I know
a nice quiet pIace

222
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,846
where we can party.

223
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:03,861
ExceIIent, pussycat.

224
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:09,634
What are you doing?

225
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,199
You don't want to cut
the upholstery

226
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,205
because it has to Iook perfect.

227
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,935
GIoria, teII them to be
carefuI in Hungarian.

228
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,374
( GIoria speaks Hungarian )

229
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,741
( Lamb repeats in Hungarian )

230
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,677
Fuck up.

231
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,475
We speak EngIish,
asshoIe.

232
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,015
If you fuck this up,

233
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,482
I wiII fuck you both
in the ass with this gun,

234
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,488
and it Iooks
you're gonna Iike it.

235
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,155
Back to work.

236
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,556
WeII...

237
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,595
I can see you're aII
as happy to be here as I am.

238
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,756
- AIicia?
- The sub in Math booked me.

239
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,925
ApparentIy he didn't think me
having to pee aII the damn time

240
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,434
was a Iegitimate excuse
for being Iate for cIass.

241
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,269
What is this, a maternity ward?

242
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,400
Look, you don't have to stick around.
Why don't you go home?

243
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,308
- What? What?
- Nah, it's okay, Mr. Decker.

244
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,975
I'II do my time. It's okay.

245
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,846
- Evening, Mr. Neeson.
- Hey, MiIt.

246
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,975
- Ready for the weekend?
- You betcha.

247
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,849
Listen, I got a teacher
and four students in detention.

248
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,081
- Don't forget 'em, huh?
- Right. I'II Iet them out.

249
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,885
- Anyone eIse, sir?
- No, that's it.

250
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,255
- Oh, hi.
- I thought you'd be gone by now?

251
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,988
- Yeah, I was just on my way out.
- WeII, I'II waIk out with you.

252
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,428
WouIdn't want you to be Iocked inside.

253
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,193
Hey, I work hard.

254
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,494
- I don't know what you were doin'.
- That's buIIshit, man.

255
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,159
- Hey, guys...
- WouId you sh--

256
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:22,173
- Quiet down!
- You know how I do, girI.

257
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:40,080
You guys be quiet.

258
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,751
I keep tryin', but this home boy
don't stop taIkin'.

259
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,954
- Detention room.
- Sam? That you?

260
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,658

261
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,428
- A'ight?
- why are you trying?

262
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,197
This mask sucks.

263
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,034
I just Iove... acid.

264
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,437
It doesn't Ieave a trace.

265
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,341
What do you want?

266
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:04,348
I want a house in Cannes,

267
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:41,085
a boat in the Bahamas...

268
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,924
- Wow.
- ...an estate with a tennis court...

269
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,231
Ooh, is that good?

270
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:03,240
...and our own private jet, hmm?

271
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,947
WeII, then, Iet's go get
extremeIy rich.

272
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,890
Ooh.

273
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,449
Oh, yeah!

274
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,189
Hey. Hey, hey!

275
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,560
It's okay. SmiIe. SmiIe.

276
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:30,568
You know this is
private property, huh?

277
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,946
I do. I'm the accountant with the firm
that's buiIding this tunneI.

278
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,581
My name is Dennis Kaye.

279
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,851
Ah, we've-- we've come
to inspect the work to see...

280
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:30,622
- From where?
- From the...

281
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,721
from the firm that's
buiIding this.

282
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,857
I'm an accountant.
They want more money, you see?

283
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,332
And before we do that,
we want to see

284
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,360
what kind of work has
actuaIIy been done,

285
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,703
because we can't just
give money--

286
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:47,711
- Done here today?
- Yes, today.

287
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,272
- Today was great.
- Oh, good. WonderfuI.

288
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,288
You shouId see the stuff
they brought in today.

289
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:03,194
The equipment they had
here today was unreaI.

290
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,701
Today they had some
really good machinery in here,

291
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,806
- and it was unbelieVable--
- That's very nice. Thank you.

292
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,614
Hey, hey!

293
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:27,448
The gate. The door.
The thing. Chop-chop.

294
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,419
You go.

295
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,456
Jesus, GIoria,
those guys are reaIIy dumb.

296
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,117
Are they coming?
Oh, Jesus.

297
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,750
I hope there's no rats.

298
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,990
What are Iooking at?

299
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,225
Nothin'.

300
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,237
Oh, nothin'. You mad?

301
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,668
Come on, everybody.
Pipe down.

302
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,642
She give me some eviI

00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,269

00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,507

305
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,277

307
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,550
Okay, okay, okay, the phones

308
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,819
Yes, there's the fuckin' phone.

00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:11,192
AII right, come on.
Hurry up, hurry up!

310
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:16,200
- Hands off, hey!
- Jesus Christ, we haven't got aII day.

311
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,501
ReIax, it can't go off
without the detonators.

312
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,596
Fuck you, Chester Lamb.

313
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,141
Oh, you're so angry.

314
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,940
That was big.
How was that?

315
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,950
Yeah? AII right, good.
Give it aim.

316
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,590

00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,730
10 minutes? AII right.

318
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,971
Dork.

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,977
- How Iong she need to take a pee?
- ReIax.

320
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,316
Frequent urination is normaI

00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,446
- Oh.

00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,927

00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,761

341
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,561
Wait up!

342
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,295
Home at Iast.

343
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,361
Wait! Don't go!

344
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,205
Excuse me.

345
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,243

346
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,334

347
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,242
Boossh!

348
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,610
Does he Iook Iike a guard
to youse?

349
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,774
He's just a glitch.

350
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,876
Find the security guard, and...

351
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,411
try not to shoot each other.

352
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,151
Pussy-puss,
why don't you stay here

353
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,419
and make sure there's
no more gIitches skuIking about.

354
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,461
I'II be in the ''orfiss.''

355
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:27,055
Alek.

356
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,397
Alek. Alek, pick up!

357
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,836
( speaking Hungarian )

358
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,306
Okay.

359
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,003

360
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,204
WeII, it's your Iuck.

361
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,076
Where are they?

362
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,446
Ready to caII it a night, Sam?

363
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,678
Yeah, I wish.
We've got two fugitives.

364
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,653
Ashton and Barrow
went up through the ceiIing.

365
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:55,659
They can't get out.

366
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,488
SchooI's Iocked down.
I'II find them.

367
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:01,658
Yeah, right.

368
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,496
AII right, kids.
Outta there.

369
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,366
This is not a night
to piss the big man off.

370
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,928
Surprise!

371
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,371
Shhh.

372
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,602
AII right, check out time.
Hogarth!

373
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,407
Make sure she gets
on the bus okay.

374
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,382
Yo, it's Hogie.

375
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,545
And I ain't no damn nurse.

376
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,818
What's the grief, Hogarth?

377
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,621
Too tough to heIp
an expectant mother?

378
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:33,630
Shit.

379
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,495
Come on.
Come if you comin'.

380
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,232
Uh-oh.

381
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,103
GIoria, pussycat,
come in.

382
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,233
- I'm here.
- The guard is toast.

383
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,335
However, we do have
three more targets--

384
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,141
two students and...

385
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,772
the teacher.

386
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,751
Get Alek and Victor

387
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,185
and head them off
at the front doors.

388
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,883
The teacher's headed my way.

389
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,859
He's mine.

390
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,955
( speaks Hungarian )
...the main haII now.

391
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,761
Let's go.

392
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,529
See him?

393
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,833
Naw, he's gone.
Oh shit, Mr. D.-- fuck.

394
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,894
Mick, Jay Tee?

395
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,100
Go, go!

396
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:22,112
Detention's over, geniuses.

397
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:28,676
Ah, ah, ah--
hoId up, hoId up.

398
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,243
The teacher is headed
to the cafeteria.

399
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,813
AIek to the cafeteria.
Come on.

400
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,518
Come on, guys.

401
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,185
Come on. Let's get
out of here. C'mon.

402
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,786
Let's go home.

403
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:43,800
Detention,
gimme responsibiIity-- whoa!

404
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,897
God, what was that?

405
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:52,910
Shit! Guns-- auto nines.

406
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,669
I know that sound
anywhere! Come on!

407
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,239
What are you doin'?
You wanna Iive? Run.

408
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,878
- Who'd be shooting in the schooI?
- How the heII do I know?

409
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,891
Where are you?!

410
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:12,393
We don't have time!
Let's go this way!

411
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,194
- Wait-- no!
- Forget the damn bag! Let's go!

412
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,702
- Now what?
- Go, just hide.

413
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,738
- Where are you guys?
- l will get you!

414
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,797
- Hide!
- Maybe this is open!

415
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,335
No sign of the two kids.

416
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,314
Okay, everyone, Iisten up.

417
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:36,082
Let's see if we can handle

418
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:41,091
spIitting up and finding them.

419
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:46,560
I'II secure the auto shop.

420
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:51,568
You hear that?

421
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:03,106
Yeah.

422
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,240
HoIy shit!

423
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,715
They trashed the pIace!

424
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,946
I was just thinkin'...

425
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,286
Iet's fuck these guys up.

426
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,295
We might need these.

427
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,692
- Let's book.
- Yeah.

428
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,235
Testing. One, two, testing.

429
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:30,240
Anyone left
in the school, listen up.

430
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,376
This is Mr. Decker.

431
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:37,848
There are people
in the school with guns.

432
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:42,615
l repeat, there are people
in the school with guns.

433
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:47,624
They'Ve killed Milt.
This is no bullshit, okay?

434
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,363
Pussycat. Office. Pronto.

435
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:02,372
- They'Ve killed the security guard.
- Fucker's gonna ruin my day.

436
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,902
There are two.

437
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,506
Make that four.

438
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,383
Now get out
of the schooI if you can.

439
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,183
If you can't get out, hide.

440
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:18,984
kids, don't try to be heroes.
This is no Video game.

441
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,925
These are kiIIers.

442
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,054
Yeah, no shit, CNN.

443
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,361
Fuck!

444
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,335
How did this happen?

445
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,770
Kids, this is no buIIshit.

446
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,467
Teacher!

447
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,102
Shit!

448
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,544
Baby, you aII right?

449
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,344
Okay, now
I'm reaIIy pissed off.

450
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:50,353
That's my girI.
Let's go find that teacher.

451
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,591
Got you now.

452
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,184
Sweet fancy, Jesus.

453
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,628
Viktor?

454
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,358
What the heII
happened, buddy?

455
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,024
Two kids tried
to fucking cut my leg off.

456
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,434
They got my gun.

457
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:11,441
Jesus.

458
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,913
It's Iike a temp agency
for midget criminaI minds.

459
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,918
The target's going
to be here in 50 minutes.

460
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,923
You Ioad up
the cars with AIek.

461
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,663
What about the teacher?

462
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,264
Crash course.
Death 101.

463
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,243
I Iove you. Go.

464
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,804
l ordered
all these motorcycle units

465
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,179
to be at the airport
for the motorcade.

466
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,277
I've got over a ton of smack

467
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,015
going into the incinerator
in this van,

468
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,116
- and it does not go without an escort.
- we depart in 45 minutes.

469
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:07,130
You can't be suggesting that
a shipment of heroin is more important

470
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:16,273
than the visit of the Vice-president
of the United States.

471
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,609
- I've onIy got so much manpower.
- That's your department, Sergeant.

472
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,341
Mine is the protection of the second
most powerfuI man in the worId.

473
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,940
No question in my mind
which takes priority.

474
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:31,955
Why don't you find
something to do?

475
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:40,027
Nice tie.

476
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,589
Testing.

477
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,569
One, two, three.

478
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,868
Can you hear me?

479
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,204
Teacher, teacher...

480
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,107
Lamb, they are in.

481
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,304
ExceIIent, pussycat.
Get to the auditorium.

482
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,611
Take another gun for Viktor.

483
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,675
Make sure
he hangs on to this one.

484
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,745
Oh my God.

485
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:09,759
Let's go around
and onto the stairs.

486
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:15,532
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God!

487
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,614
HoId on, hoId on.
HoId on, hoId on.

488
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,676
AII right,
how do we get out of here?

489
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,722
Stage door, that way.

490
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,352
Shit, the door is Iocked.
Is there another door?

491
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,953
- I don't think so.
- Better be another door.

492
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,399
- There isn't!
- Damn!

493
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,095
- You aII right?
- Just reaIIy winded.

494
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,966
- Shit.
- Hogie?

495
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,200
- Thank you.
- Naw, thank you.

496
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,832
- Hey, shit! What you--
- Put the gun down!

497
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,846
What do you think?
Just trying not to get kiIIed here.

498
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:04,671
- Did the fuckers foIIow you, man?
- Yo, I don't know, aII right?

499
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,616
- You aII right?
- They're gonna be here soon.

500
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:12,622
- Are you aII right?
- Whatever.

501
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:18,361
- What' you mean ''whatever''?
- I wonder if Mr. Decker's okay.

502
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,196
- Fuck Mr. Decker!
- Oh, right.

503
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,135
Sam... Decker.

504
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,366
Wow.
I feeI Iike I know you.

505
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,237
Mind if I caII you Sam?

506
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,972
Now, Sam,

507
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,038
I'm gonna Iay it out for you.

508
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:38,810
Those two kids?

509
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,181
we haVe them in the auditorium.

510
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,186
Don't worry,

It's win-win-win, Sam.

They wouIdn't do it for you.

They probabIy right
outside them doors.

684
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,877
( poIice radio chatter )

685
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,313
Crack the egg, pussycat.

686
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:57,319
Bingo.

687
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,782
And Bango.

688
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,519
Oh, shit! Mr. Decker!
Oh my God!

689
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,925
WiIIy, what the heII
are you doing here?

690
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:09,932
Studying in the Iibrary--
I'm trying to get a schoIarship.

691
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,097
I didn't think it'd be this tough!

692
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,865
The phones are fucked!

693
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,702
The aIarms too-- I've tried.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

694
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,800
WiIIy, if you can get
to the main phone junction,

695
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:24,814
couId you reconnect the Iines?
Set off the aIarm?

696
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,815
Try me.

697
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,876
Okay, WiIIy.

698
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,184
I'II try to get you into the auditorium
through the baIcony upstairs.

699
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:37,455
Phone junction is down
in the boiIer room.

700
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,361
Can you make it?

701
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,863
WeII, it's as easy
as faIIin' down stairs.

702
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,661
A-pIus.

703
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,066
Look, the safety is off--
it's Ioaded.

704
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,433
- Count your shots, okay?
- Yeah.

705
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,597

708
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,773
How do you feeI about shooting some...
innocent bystanders?

709
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,080
You sure know how to show
a girI a good time.

710
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:06,213
Haa!

711
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,656
AImost Iet you

712
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:13,662
HoIy shit! You're not dead?

713
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,831
- Yo, sir!
- AIicia, are you okay?

714
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,164
We did the wickedest thing.
We hooked up this fence.

715
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:20,965
Listen, Iisten,
is there a Iadder back there?

716
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:24,997

00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:30,012

00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:38,487
- AIicia, you okay?
- No, I need to get to a hospitaI--

719
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,420
Just sit down. We'II get you there,
okay? Just reIax.

720
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,957
- Yo, what're we gonna do?
- Check your ammo.

721
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,962
- You got ammo in there?
- No, I had a IittIe accident.

722
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,968
Shit.

723
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,266
There's no way.

724
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,103
( footsteps approaching )

725
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,200

728
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,214
down to the metaI shop.
You can get outside from there.

729
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:12,221
The metaI shop's aIways Iocked!

730
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,488
I unIocked it.

But you get an F... for fuck up!

743
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,790
Ah! Fuck! Jesus Christ!

744
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,853

749
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,601

750
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,796
- I can't beIieve it.

751
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:12,137
He thinks he's fast!

752
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,872

754
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,146
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,045
We ain't havin' this

00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,796
He's ex-miIitary.

784
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,742
He was on the same A-team

785
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,712
Why didn't you fuckin'

788
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:06,948
Stay away from there--
motion activated detonators.

789
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,014
You cross those beams--
boom! Come here.

790
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,719
Thanks for the warning.

791
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,056
- What happened to the others?
- I don't know.

792
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:16,759
Last time I saw them
they were headed for the gym.

793
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,858
So how are we gonna
get out of here?

794

You Ieft them behind?

00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,986
Hey, Mick, come on.

802
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,517
It's okay to be scared.

803
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:51,533
It means you stiII wanna Iive.

804
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:55,003
You scared?

805
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,268
There's no time to think

806
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,573
If you don't heIp,

807
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,206
- Your friends!

00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,648
With two of us

809
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:12,654
Shhh.
It's Iike I said in cIass.

810
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,766
The side that beIieves
the most wins.

811
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,394
Yeah, I beIieve
they've got more guns.

812
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,370
And I reaIIy beIieve they're gonna come
and bIow our asses off!

813
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:33,535
So we'II have to even the odds.

814
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,670
How?

815
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:41,149

You see anything?

817
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:48,286
lt's too quiet.

818
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,295
You know how to fire
one of these?

819
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:15,117
- No, man. I don't do archery.
- And I do?

820
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:36,199
You kiII anybody?

821
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,107

00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,898
Target acquisition

848
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,809
Strike is a go.
Repeat, strike is a go.

Jay Tee, don't you have cIass?

920
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,373
Come on, guys,
it's a schooI zone.

921
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:16,850
Move it aIong.
There's no parking.

922
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:20,446
Yeah.

01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,184
Got a fuckin' probIem, bitch?

924
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:27,195

01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:32,333
No, you've got a probIem.

926
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,534

927
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:40,542
Listen, you?

928
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:47,408
Wow, pretty brave
for a teacher.

929
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:48,973
What do you teach?
You teach... poetry?

930
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:53,988
You're a Iover,
not a fighter, right?

931
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,259
Good one, Leon. Ah, yeah.

932
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,022
No, it's...

933
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:02,826
it's phys-ed and history.

934
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,163
See, this is phys-ed...

935
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:09,466
whoa!

936
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:14,475
- That's my teacher.
- ...and you're history.

937
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:20,239
I don't wanna see you
around here again, you got it?

938
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:23,444
Go on, beat it.

939
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,510
Oh, yes.

940
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,284

01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,871
Hey, I got a gift for you.

945
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,499
I took it off one
of your students up the bIock.

946
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:47,542
I can't have it in the car so,
here you go.

947
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,340
I don't know, Sam.

948
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,108
Sometimes it just feeIs Iike Bosnia
aII over again.

949
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,342
( hip-hop music playing )

950
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,885
Hi, Mr. Decker.

951
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:01,890
Oh, he's so hot!

952
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:05,691
Excuse me, pIease.

01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,695
Hey, WiIIy, sIow down.

957
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:22,808
Why don't you watch

958
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:26,314
Okay, okay. WiIIy, Iisten, keep it

959
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:31,319

960
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,321
- Fuck you.
- Now, Iook, AIicia,

961
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,152
that makeup test

962
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,454
Yeah, and how am I supposed
to find the time, Mr. Decker?

963
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,823
I do have more important shit
to worry about right now, okay?

964
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:43,058
What do you think
of this, pussycat?

965
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:46,898
Very nice.
What do you think?

966
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,800
Ah, Nice.

967
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,998
Disgusting.

968
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,734
A high schooI.

969
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,070
Who wouId ever suspect
a high schooI?

970
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,735
It's perfect.

971
01:06:55,811 --> 01:07:00,748
Just take the pictures.

972
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,222
You got it?

973
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:19,324
2,000 a week, pIus medicaI
and profit participation.

974
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,996
Start first thing Monday.

975
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,936
That's great.

976
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,600
I have enough troubIe with students
having sex Iike rabbits.

977
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:30,736
I don't need teachers
making it worse.

978
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:34,681
Yeah.

979
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,687
well, as a matter of fact,
you'Ve got a point there, Lyle.

980
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,549
I don't see any other choice
so I'm just going to have to quit.

981
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:47,562
That's my Ietter of resignation,
effective today.

982
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:51,361
Excuse me,
I'm Iate for history cIass.

983
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:56,371
He's joking, right?

984
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:16,086
No. No, he's not.

985
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,558
So ultimately, the aerial bombing
campaign by the United States,

986
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,061
faiIed to defeat the north.

987
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,688
Who knows why?

988
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,131
- Man: who the fuck cares?
- Hey. CharIee?

989
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,795
- Ah...
- Why was that cruciaI?

990
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,303
- Sorry, Mr. Decker, I don't know.
- Neither do I, sir.

991
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:33,273
- Why the heII are we taIking about--
- AII right, guys, quiet. Mick?

992
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:36,743
What's the point? Who gives a shit
about history anyway?

993
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,837
- There it is. See?
- The point is this.

994
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,381
It doesn't matter who has more
soIdiers or more bombs.

995
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,916
Whoever is the most committed
to their cause, aIways wins.

996
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,384
- Thank you!
- Okay, guys.

997
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,183
- Thanks a lot.
- AII right, Mick.

998
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,417
AII right, get out of here.
See you in the gym.

999
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,255
- I'm open!
- Defense.

1000
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,318
Come on, pass it up!
Whoo-hoo!

1001
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:56,387
- I got this.
- What?

1002
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:00,993
Come on, find your zone.

1003
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,298
What are you Iooking at?

1004
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,066
- A FOG.
- What's a FOG?

1005
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,041
F-O-G, FuckabIe OIder Guy.

1006
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:11,842
Yeah? Just don't get pregnant.

1007
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:16,681
You're a good teacher, Sam.

1008
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:20,381
The kind we can't afford to lose.

1009
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:25,393
Come on, LyIe,
we don't teach here.

1010
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:48,116
This isn't a schooI,
it's a prison.

1011
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,150
We just detain these kids untiI
they're oId enough to graduate

1012
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:57,852
with dipIomas
they can't even read.

1013
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:02,864
It's my Iast day.

1014
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:11,038
Okay.

1015
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:19,207
Macer's mother's in the hospitaI.

1016
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:24,545
I need someone to fiII in
for his detention cIass.

1017
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:31,953
What?

1018
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,135
You're actuaIIy
making me stay after schooI?

1019
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,535
WeII, don't think of it
as a punishment.

1020
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,664
Think of it as a...
a parting gesture.

1021
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:56,677
Motherfucker!

1022
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,710
- Break it up!
- Take him down, Jay Tee.

1023
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:07,722
Okay. Come on,
that's enough. Hey.

1024
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:14,395
That's enough.

1025
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:38,619
AsshoIe threatened to kiII me.
You can expeI him for that.

1026
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,585
- What?
- Come on.

1027
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,854
- Detention shouId be pIenty.
- What for?

1028
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:50,865
You can't stop shit.
I heard you knocked up AIicia.

1029
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:07,381
What happened?
Rubber too big and faII off?

1030
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:35,400
- What?
- That's enough. I said enough.

1031
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,775
Hit the showers.
Hey! Go on, hit the showers.

1032
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:42,442
FederaI Agent GIen Prokow,
Secret Service.

1033
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,679
As of now, this precinct and aII units
are under my direct controI

1034
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:49,690
during the visit of the vice-president.

1035
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:55,596
What?

1036
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,929
BuIIshit.
You don't have the authority.

1037
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:08,238
FederaI Iaw gives me
the authority.

1038
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,436
Since when?

1039
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,069
ApriI 15, 1865.
The day after LincoIn was shot.

1040
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,545
You gotta be shitting me.

1041
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,479
LyIe's reaIIy pissed.

1042
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,485
Yeah, I know.

1043
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,646
He put me on detention.

1044
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:24,658
Oh.

1045
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:31,256
You know, I think
he actuaIIy Iikes you,

1046
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:35,963
God knows why.

1047
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:40,975
It's not him. It's...

1048
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,448
it's this pIace.

1049
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,582
I don't know why
you wanna stay.

1050
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,560
You know me.

1051
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:05,566
Besides, this pIace
does have some very...

1052
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:15,776
pIeasant memories.

1053
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:21,945
Mr. Decker, I need to see you
in your cIassroom for a moment.

1054
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:25,111
Come on, l'll be late
for detention.

1055
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,052
l don't care.

1056
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,089
I wanna do it one Iast time
with the teacher.

1057
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,056
Oh, girI, what's wrong?
You aII right?

1058
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:35,062
Nothing.
Get out of my face.

1059
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,704
Listen, why don't you
come with me?

1060
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:49,369
Some other Iifetime, maybe.

1061
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,140
Come on, girI, I know
a nice quiet pIace

1062
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,411
where we can party.

1063
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,749
ExceIIent, pussycat.

1064
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,721
What are you doing?

1065
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:06,727
You don't want to cut
the upholstery

1066
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,427
because it has to Iook perfect.

1067
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,159
GIoria, teII them to be
carefuI in Hungarian.

1068
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:15,397
( GIoria speaks Hungarian )

1069
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,871
( Lamb repeats in Hungarian )

1070
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,501
Fuck up.

1071
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,977
We speak EngIish,
asshoIe.

1072
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,946
If you fuck this up,

1073
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:28,244
I wiII fuck you both
in the ass with this gun,

1074
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,751
and it Iooks
you're gonna Iike it.

1075
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,377
Back to work.

1076
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:36,550
WeII...

1077
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,219
I can see you're aII
as happy to be here as I am.

1078
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:43,025
- AIicia?
- The sub in Math booked me.

1079
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:48,035
ApparentIy he didn't think me
having to pee aII the damn time

1080
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:52,496
was a Iegitimate excuse
for being Iate for cIass.

1081
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:56,476
What is this, a maternity ward?

1082
01:16:56,545 --> 01:17:01,414
Look, you don't have to stick around.
Why don't you go home?

1083
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,111
- What? What?
- Nah, it's okay, Mr. Decker.

1084
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:09,123
I'II do my time. It's okay.

1085
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:12,622
- Evening, Mr. Neeson.
- Hey, MiIt.

1086
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:17,631
- Ready for the weekend?
- You betcha.

1087
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:22,932
Listen, I got a teacher
and four students in detention.

1088
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:27,942
- Don't forget 'em, huh?
- Right. I'II Iet them out.

1089
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,477
- Anyone eIse, sir?
- No, that's it.

1090
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:36,278
- Oh, hi.
- I thought you'd be gone by now?

1091
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,819
- Yeah, I was just on my way out.
- WeII, I'II waIk out with you.

1092
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,515
WouIdn't want you to be Iocked inside.

1093
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:46,357
Hey, I work hard.

1094
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:51,024
- I don't know what you were doin'.
- That's buIIshit, man.

1095
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:56,036
- Hey, guys...
- WouId you sh--

1096
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:02,776
- Quiet down!
- You know how I do, girI.

1097
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:07,047
You guys be quiet.

1098
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:10,482
I keep tryin', but this home boy
don't stop taIkin'.

1099
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,487
- Detention room.
- Sam? That you?

1100
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,386

1101
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,015
- A'ight?

1102
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,356
This mask sucks.

1103
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,828
I just Iove... acid.

1104
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,422
It doesn't Ieave a trace.

1105
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,490
What do you want?

1106
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,536
I want a house in Cannes,

1107
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:30,434
a boat in the Bahamas...

1108
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:34,271
- Wow.
- ...an estate with a tennis court...

1109
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,639
Ooh, is that good?

1110
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:40,648
...and our own private jet, hmm?

1111
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,909
WeII, then, Iet's go get
extremeIy rich.

1112
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,147
Ooh.

1113
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,282
Oh, yeah!

1114
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,757
Hey. Hey, hey!

1115
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,021
It's okay. SmiIe. SmiIe.

1116
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,824
You know this is
private property, huh?

1117
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:59,833
I do. I'm the accountant with the firm
that's buiIding this tunneI.

1118
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,470
My name is Dennis Kaye.

1119
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,369
Ah, we've-- we've come
to inspect the work to see...

1120
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,374
- From where?
- From the...

1121
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:09,603
from the firm that's
buiIding this.

1122
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:11,339
I'm an accountant.
They want more money, you see?

1123
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,005
And before we do that,
we want to see

1124
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,174
what kind of work has
actuaIIy been done,

1125
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,013
because we can't just
give money--

1126
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:20,854
- Done here today?
- Yes, today.

1127
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,890
- Today was great.
- Oh, good. WonderfuI.

1128
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,255
You shouId see the stuff
they brought in today.

1129
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,384
The equipment they had
here today was unreaI.

1130
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,984
Today they had some
really good machinery in here,

1131
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:30,327
- and it was unbelieVable--
- That's very nice. Thank you.

1132
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:31,797
Hey, hey!

1133
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:36,201
The gate. The door.
The thing. Chop-chop.

1134
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:39,069
You go.

1135
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,109
Jesus, GIoria,
those guys are reaIIy dumb.

1136
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:44,009
Are they coming?
Oh, Jesus.

1137
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,310
I hope there's no rats.

1138
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,247
What are Iooking at?

1139
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,809
Nothin'.

1140
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:57,825
Oh, nothin'. You mad?

1141
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:03,230
Come on, everybody.
Pipe down.

1142

01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:33,353

1144
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:38,365

1145
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:43,461

1147
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:49,302
Okay, okay, okay, the phones
shouId be right here.

1148
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,174
Yes, there's the fuckin' phone.

1149
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:54,545
AII right, come on.
Hurry up, hurry up!

1150
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,481
- Hands off, hey!
- Jesus Christ, we haven't got aII day.

1151
01:20:56,551 --> 01:21:00,578
ReIax, it can't go off
without the detonators.

1152
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:04,284
Fuck you, Chester Lamb.

1153
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:09,296
Oh, you're so angry.

1154
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,465
That was big.
How was that?

1155
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,364
Yeah? AII right, good.
Give it aim.

01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,102
10 minutes? AII right.

1158

01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,274
- How Iong she need to take a pee?
- ReIax.

1160
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,936
Frequent urination is normaI

1161
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:26,242
- Oh.
