00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,500
Hey, your lawyer
has been notified.

182
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,169
Now let me tell you something,
okay. And you listen.

183
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:23,257
And you listen real good,
you worthless piece of shit.

184
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,259
You've got two alternatives.

185
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,595
Number one. You give us Kane.

186
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:30,515
And we put him
away for a long time.

187
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:33,101
Number two.
You don't give us Kane.

188
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,354
And we put the word
out you snitched.

189
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:36,896
Ah!

190
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:37,480
N~_

191
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,148
Ah!

192
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:42,777
Yeah. We put the word
out you snitched.

193
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,737
Gave us his whole pipeline.

194
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,572
And uh...

195
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:50,034
I'll give you... maybe...

196
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:50,993
...a week?

197
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:51,744
Yeah, maybe.

198
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,538
[BULLET]
A week? A week?

199
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:57,667
A week, best, before he
finds you and kills you.

200
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,546
So your best bet...
option number one.

201
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:02,630
Man, you're bluffing, man.

202
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,050
People saw me come in here.
People know I'm here.

203
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,176
[BULLET]
Yeah, you're right.

204
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:08,052
You're bluffing!

205
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:11,514
You're right. Only one
way to find out.

206
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,559
We're gonna go get coffee.
You do what you got to do.

207
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:15,560
Okay, okay, okay, okay-

208
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,395
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

209
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,272
[LEROY stammers]

210
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,315
L-I changed my mind.

211
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,609
I'll give you what you need.

212
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,363
My charge can get reduced,
right, if I do this?

213
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:29,031
You guys are gonna work
with me. That's what they say.

214
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,949
You're gonna work with me.

215
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,201
You start writing.
We'll see what we can do.

216
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,494
[LEROY] Yes, sir.

217
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,978
[door closes]

218
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:04,192
Lukas Kruger.
Kane's right-hand man.

219
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,318
Is he talking?

220
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,446
Eh... More like whining.

221
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,573
But he signed it.

222
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:15,995
How'd you get him to sign this?

223
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,456
You don't want to
know that, Captain.

224
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,707
[CAPTAIN BLANCHE sighs]

225
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,710
You're right.
I don't want to know.

226
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,545
[BULLET]
But Leroy said that uh...

227
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:27,340
Kane has something big
going down in the A.M.

228
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,843
So it looks like we'll
be doing an all-nighter.

229
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,055
Works out of a
art studio downtown.

230
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:39,310
Kruger. I want the
gorilla, not the monkey.

231
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,021
One animal at a time, Captain.

232
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,649
[CAPTAIN BLANCHE laughs]

233
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,446
[ESTES] Man, you really had Leroy
snitchin' like a little bitch.

234
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,073
[BULLET]
All day, brother.

235
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,617
[men laugh]

236
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,880
Detective, I want to see
what my client just signed.

237
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,590
Wait a minute.
What'd you just say?

238
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,511
I said I want to see what
my client just signed.

239
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,181
Wow. Leroy must be doing
pretty well for himself.

240
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,266
Pricey lawyer like you...

241
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,101
Don't fuck with me, Marasco.

242
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,520
You had no business having
him sign an affidavit

243
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:23,771
without me there.

244
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,982
He signed it on his own.

245
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,111
Look, the affidavit is on file
at the clerk's office.

246
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,114
You want a copy, I'm sure
they'll give it to you.

247
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,241
But as for me...

248
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,703
I'm running late, sweetheart.

249
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,830
Merde!

250
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,878
Special Agent Daehn.

251
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,843
So what can we do for you,
Special Agent Daehn?

252
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,012
I'm here to talk about
the ongoing investigation

253
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,514
of the Kane cartel.

254
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,766
[BULLET]
What, the feds need our help?

255
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:04,061
Usually us local cops
are in the way.

256
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,397
Well, actually the Attorney
General wants to investigate

257
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,984
new evidence that might lead
to Manuel Kane's innocence.

258
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,819
You took him down, detective.

259
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,988
Do you have any idea what
this evidence could be?

260
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,323
Sure...

261
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,199
Non-existent.

262
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,870
I caught Kane red-handed.
He's guilty as hell.

263
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:26,208
And the men he killed...
were good cops and friends.

264
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:30,755
Okay, well, this could just be a
last-ditch legal effort, but...

265
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:34,550
...we'd still like to review any
files you may have on Kane.

266
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,138
All my files on Kane...
they're all up here. Heh.

267
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:43,184
And no psych in his right mind
would go in there unarmed.

268
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,478
Okay, well um...

269
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:49,106
Would you mind if I shadowed
him on the investigation?

270
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:53,027
I hear you have quite
the reputation, detective.

271
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,363
Look, shadow me all you want.

272
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,866
But when I turn a corner,
my shadow disappears.

273
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,910
And I ain't no
fuckin' babysitter.

274
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,579
So, we're on then at twelve.

275
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:06,165
Stay in your own lane, Agent.

276
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:08,292
Special Agent.

277
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,842
Is he always this grumpy?

278
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:21,806
Grumpy? He was
actually in a good mood.

279
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,307
Great.

280
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:24,683
Well, thank you.

281
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,387
I'd like to speak to
this man privately, please.

282
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,103
You listen to me clearly.

283
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,898
You can tell your father

284
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:16,068
that if anything
happens to my daughter,

285
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,780
I will personally
escort you both to hell.

286
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:25,828
I will track you down using
my last penny to the last day.

287
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,705
Like the dogs that you are.

288
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,584
And I don't care if
they have to execute me.

289
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,545
I've accepted my fate.

290
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,672
Have you, Governor?

291
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:40,926
My daughter... is my
whole world to me.

292
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,511
It's a dangerous man,

293
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,433
whose very meaning for
existence is threatened.

294
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,018
Remember that.

295
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:55,316
Yes, Governor.

296
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,194
And you remember...

297
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,613
My father and I...

298
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:03,782
We're the only bloodline
left in this shit world.

You do your part;
we all get what we want.

300
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,750

301
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,377
Yes.

302
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,173
[MANUEL] Good.

303
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,343
Soon you'll get the information
you need to release me.

304
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,887
Guards! Get me out of here.

305
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:42,196
Great art claims
to understand death.

306
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,697
But, y'know...

307
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:48,619
It's not until you've looked
down the barrel of a gun...

308
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:53,040
...that you truly understand
the meaning of death.

309
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:55,918
This country was founded
by thieves and murderers,

310
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,420

social misfits.

311
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:02,216
But you know what those misfits
did, the first chance they got?

312
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:05,970
They dumped their Bible
and picked up a gun.

00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,430
This country is built
on the barrel of a gun,

314
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,975
not a fucking constitution.

315
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,937
There shouldn't be stars on
the flag, there should be guns.

316
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,648
We are the poor with guns.

317

and we will fuck you up!

00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,451
you're not just fucking with me,

he has one week.

for Vanessa, for her birthday.

given to her by Frank.

00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:11,606
Explain, explain!

534
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,109
Please, please tell me how
you just leave my child.

535
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,611
Wh-What-- How-- What do you
mean bad guys took him?

536
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,656
What does that--
What does that fuckin' mean?

537
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:20,156
No, no.

538

These people, they're
bad people. They'll--

539
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:22,575
Hello, 911 ?

Don't you understand?

541
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,957
We can't. We have
to do what they say.

542
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:32,419
Now I will get him back.

543
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,921
I will get him back.

Thank you.

And thank you, Mr. Yung.
We'll see you next Thursday.

548
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,980
Let's get this...

00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:55,650
Okay...

00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:01,906
Excuse me... please.

00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,286
[door closes]

553
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:10,165
I heard about your little visit
to San Quentin this morning.

554
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,918
Was that part of
the instructions? No.

555
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,379
There are things a father
can imagine happening

556
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:19,507
to his daughter that
are worse than death.

557
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,134
And whatever the worst
you can imagine,

558
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,428
I make it happen everyday.

559
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:29,976
One more mistake...
and the worst happens.

00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,150
God! How could I be so stupid?

562
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,746
Why do you think
they're doing this?

563
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,877
It's probably because I'm
the governor's daughter.

564
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,629
Really?

565
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,714
Your dad is the governor?

566
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,718
M)' grampa is a cop.

Get in.

573
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:57,605
You.

574
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:01,150
You expecting someone else?

575
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,111
Where's my grandson?

576
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:06,781
Safe... for now.

577
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,244
But if my son is executed,
your baby boy is gonna join him.

578
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:18,167
Three years ago, your testimony
put my son in prison.

579
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,671
Your new testimony is
gonna get him released.

580
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:23,715
What's this?

581
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:26,259
[CARLITO]
A legal document.

582
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:30,054
Where you officially recant your
testimony against Manuel Kane.

583
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:33,182
Your son murdered three cops.

584
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,602
It's gonna be tough
covering that up.

585
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,271
[CARLITO]
Hmm... Look closer.

586
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:43,443
[BULLET] You want me
to say I killed 'em?

587
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,237
You were taking money
from Manuel Kane...

588
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:50,742
...to turn a blind eye from
some of his business affairs.

589
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,036
When the investigating
officers found out about it

590
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,705
you killed them and
blamed it on him.

591
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,124
A very selfish thing to do.

592
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,209
No one is gonna believe it.

593
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:04,672
Well for your grandson's sake,
you better hope they do.

594
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:08,426
And when that gets to the
governor and he pardons my son,

595
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,386
we'll turn Mario
over to his mother.

596
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:13,431
How do I know
you'll release him?

597
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,974
Trust me.

598
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:24,692

Um... There is one more thing.

00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,617
This is awkward.

602
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:35,578
We should've told
Detective about this first.

603
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,581
We're going to need you
to sign this as well.

604
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,210

you with the execution.

the one who's fucked.

for your grandson.

00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,751
Do I trust him?

711
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,798
Sometimes...
it's not by the book.

712
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:29,176
It's not in your head,
it's in your gut.

713
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:32,179
Feel it.

714
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:38,310
Let's just go back
to the station.

715
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,647
Detective!
This isn't the wild west.

716
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:43,774
Let me help you.

717
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,028
[BULLET]
You can't.

718
00:49:48,237 --> 00:49:49,655
[keys clatter]

719
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:53,367
Stay out of my way.

720
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:55,244
Bullet, come on.

721
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:58,247
Shit.

722
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,630
Alright. Sorry, mister.

723
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,968
Sorry, sorry. Don't--

724
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:12,094
[MAN coughs]

725
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:18,475
[helicopter in distance]

726
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:28,986
[ESTES sighs]

727
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:34,825
I know cops go bad
sometimes, but...

728
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:38,287
...it's bullshit.
Frank's no cop killer.

729
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,164
Yeah, there's no way.

730
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:42,541
And what the hell do
they even have on him?

731
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:57,890
[beeping]

732
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:00,976
[CARLITO]
Good day, Detective.

733
00:51:01,185 --> 00:51:02,811
Have a seat.

734
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:12,738
You made my friend,
Kruger, very unhappy.

735
00:51:14,782 --> 00:51:18,410
I didn't sign this last night,
and I'm not signing it now.

736
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,454
So if you came for a killing,

737
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:21,997
let's get to it.

738
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:23,624
Heh. We will.

739
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:26,085
I promised
Kruger here the honors.

740
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:27,461
It's the life you can save

741
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,381
that'll give you the
impetus to sign.

742
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,511
Hey, hey, there's movement.

743
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,429
You think he slipped in
without us seeing?

744
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:39,723
One-teen-ninety to
dispatch. Be advised.

745
00:51:39,932 --> 00:51:41,934
Marasco's in his apartment.

746
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,060
We're gonna need backup.

747
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:46,313
Respond code two.
Tell 'em to come easy.

748
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:47,648
Let's go.

749
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:53,195
[CARLITO] You know, judging
by your actions last night,

750
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:58,158
you don't fully appreciate the
danger your grandson is in.

751
00:51:58,367 --> 00:52:01,287
I'm not a nice man, Detective.
You've read my file.

752
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:03,372
I do horrible things to people.

753
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,167
Men, women, children.

754
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:09,878
Mario won't be an exception.

755
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,401
Get the kid.

756
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,074
Grampa, help please!

757
00:52:39,283 --> 00:52:41,327
[BULLET]
Mario! You be strong.

758
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:42,536
[CARLITO] Go ahead.

759
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:44,246
Take his fingers off.

760
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:47,082
One, two...

761
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,334
[BULLET]
No! No!

762
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:48,876
Wait, wait, wait!

763
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:50,919
[MARIO] Please, please!
Don't let them do this!

764
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:55,049
[CARLITO]
Now you listen to me, Detective.

765
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:58,927
I will take him apart
one piece at a time.

766
00:52:59,136 --> 00:53:01,138
One finger at a time.

767
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:04,683
You sign it.

768
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:33,087
Thanks for signing.

769
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:36,882
[BULLET groans]

770
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:42,596
Let's just try and see if
we can get him to come out.

771
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:44,014
We gotta try to
take him in easy.

772
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:44,848
Okay-

773
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:46,850
[g u n cocks]

774
00:53:47,935 --> 00:53:50,646
Any last words?

775
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:52,773
Just two...

776
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,108
"Fuck" and "you"!

777
00:53:54,525 --> 00:53:56,443
[knocking]

778
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:57,903
[ESTES] Hey Frank.
Estes, Tarvis...

779
00:53:58,112 --> 00:54:00,614
Come on out, man.
We just wanna talk to ya.

780
00:54:02,074 --> 00:54:04,159
Come on out.
We just wanna talk.

781
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:16,547
Come on out, Frank.

782
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:20,676
It's Estes, Tarvis...
We just wanna talk.

783
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:22,594
[TARVIS]
Hey Frank, it's Tarvis, man.

784
00:54:22,803 --> 00:54:26,181
We know you didn't do anything.
Come out and talk to us.

785
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:39,611
Whoa, whoa, hey.
What are you doing?

786
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,822
Easy. We told 'em to come easy.

[muffled gunfire]

791

They' re gettin ' away.

792
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:24,967
Frank, drop your gun.

793
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:26,969
Frank, drop your gun now!

794
00:56:27,177 --> 00:56:28,428
[BULLET]
They're gettin' the fuck away!

795
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:30,764
Drop your gun... now!

797
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:35,978
Get him.

[siren wails in distance]

801
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:17,102
Get their uniforms.

[phone rings]

803

Governor Johnson.

804
00:57:27,988 --> 00:57:30,282
[CARLITO] Alright,
I've got your confession.

805
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,326
I delivered you
your man to the cops.

806
00:57:32,534 --> 00:57:34,286
Now let my son out.

807
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:38,165
Listen, the pardon is
still in a process.

808
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,499
It has to go through judicial--

809
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:41,418
No. Wait, wait, wait, stop.

810
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:44,004
You don't understand.
I don't want excuses.

811
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:45,005
You make it happen.

812
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:47,090
Don't be an asshole
for God's sake!

813
00:57:47,299 --> 00:57:48,842
I'm just a governor.

814
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:50,886
I want it done just
as fast as you do.

815
00:57:51,094 --> 00:57:52,387
I want my daughter back.

816
00:57:52,596 --> 00:57:54,973
Then you better use all
the influence you have

817
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:56,808
on those judges.

818
00:57:57,017 --> 00:57:59,603
Because if my son's not
released by noon tomorrow,

819
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:02,439
your baby girl is
worse than dead.

820
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,441
[GOVERNOR JOHNSON] No, listen.
I just need some time!

821
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,776
We don't--

822
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,656
Goddamn it!

823
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:12,199
Fuck!

[indistinct chatter]

825
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:48,193
[AGENT DAEHN] I've got to give
it to him. He's thorough.

826
00:59:08,547 --> 00:59:09,673
[FBI AGENT]
Take a look at this.

827
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:10,549
What is it?

828
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:12,968
[FBI AGENT]
A suicide note.

829
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:15,804
He wanted to kill Marasco-
make it look like a suicide.

830
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:17,472
Insurance against
the confession.

831
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:19,599
Yeah, suicide note...

832
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:21,351
It's gotta be a stitch up.

833
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,812
I didn't even know
Marasco could write.

834
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,857
Let me tell you something.
I know Frank.

835
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:28,900
He's no cop killer.

836
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,949
[whispering]
You almost got it?

837
00:59:36,158 --> 00:59:39,619
[MARIO]
Almost there.

838
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:41,371
[whispering]
Just a little closer.

839
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,915
I'm trying

840
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:50,964
[door opens]

841
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,263
Princesa Durmiente!

842
00:59:58,472 --> 00:59:59,598
Wake up!

843
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,559
Get the kids in the van.
We need to leave now.

844
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:05,353
I was awake.

845
01:00:05,562 --> 01:00:07,397
Yeah, sure.

846
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,569
We're gonna take
a little journey.

847
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:22,370
[JESSICA] Ah! Ow!

848
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:29,211
[CAPTAIN BLANCHE]
So how long have they had him?

849
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:33,173
Too long. 1:45 yesterday.

850
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:37,469
I'm sorry, Frank.
I should've known.

851
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,054
[CAPTAIN BLANCHE]
We all should've.

852
01:00:39,262 --> 01:00:42,808
Well... shoot. That ain't
gonna get my grandson back.

853
01:00:43,016 --> 01:00:44,184
We gotta do something.

854
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:45,435
[phone rings]

855
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:46,895
Yeah.

856
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:48,188
Looks like the
governor is coming up

857
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:50,148
with the attorney general.

858
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:56,571
[ATTORNEY GENERAL]
Kane is getting desperate.

859
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,658
He means what he
says, Mr. Governor.

860
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:01,910
I fear that if Manuel
Kane is executed,

861
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:03,829
the same will happen
to your daughter.

862
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:06,081
I'm betting Mario will be next.

863
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:12,379
[GOVERNOR JOHNSON] Now, I've gotten
several of these in the last few days.

864
01:01:12,587 --> 01:01:16,299
It doesn't excuse my actions.

865
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:19,010
Or lack of action.

866
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:23,390
I take full responsibilty for
the death of four good cops.

867
01:01:25,684 --> 01:01:27,352
And detective...

868
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,022
I believe you have the right--

869
01:01:31,231 --> 01:01:34,109
He's gonna kill her.
You know that, don't you?

870
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:38,822
I can't let that happen.

871
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,032
We have to do the right thing.

872
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:43,243
[BULLET]
Well, you send in a posse,

873
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:46,288
you might as well put a gun
to both them kids' heads.

874
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:52,210
I know... So what do we do?

875
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,755
[BULLET]
We don't do anything.

876
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:01,970
And what I'm gonna do...
you don't want to know.

877
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,765
I won't be needing
that, Captain.

878
01:03:49,202 --> 01:03:51,454
[BULLET]
Okay, pretty naked lady.

879
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:53,707
Where's Kane?

880
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:56,459
Get the fuck out of here
or I will have your badge.

881
01:03:56,668 --> 01:03:59,796
You know, when people
wake up in the morning,

882
01:04:00,005 --> 01:04:01,256
they see the sunshine.

883
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:03,717
I wake up, I see the
shit in the streets.

884
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:06,011
And I gotta clean it up
'cause it's my job.

885
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:08,596
And I like my job.

886
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:10,974
