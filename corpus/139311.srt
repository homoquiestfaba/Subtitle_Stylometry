1
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:30,984
Another one coming down.

2
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:32,246
Hang on.

3
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:22,066
THE MASK

4
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:36,148
I got those...

5
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,445
concert tickets you wanted.

6
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,952
You're kidding!

7
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,817
For Friday night?

8
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,756
Stanley, this is great.

9
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,456
What time do I pick you up?

10
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:48,462
Here's the thing.

11
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,227
My best girlfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

12
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,098
so could we get an extra ticket
for her?

13
00:01:56,705 --> 00:02:00,471
They're sold out. That means
there's no more.

14
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,710
I can't let her sit home all alone.

15
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:08,772
I'll tell you what.

16
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,317
Go with your friend.

17
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,882
I couldn't do that.

18
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:15,354
No, come on.

19
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,988
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

20
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,153
Really, you are.

21
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:25,063
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best.

22
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,801
That was the most sickening display

23
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:35,400
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.

24
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:37,069
I'm wearing her down.

25
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:40,478
Buddy, you need a little
change of pace.

26
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:43,483
Tonight, I'll take you
on a love safari.

27
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:47,009
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle.

28
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,079
Tell me more, bwana.

29
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:52,991
The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.

30
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,552
Only the cr me de la cr me
need apply.

31
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,890
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?

32
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,299
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.

33
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:03,599
This will be the perfect...

34
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,003
night on the town.

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,681
Hold the phone.

36
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:23,918
Killer at three o'clock.

37
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,017
Stand back and observe.

38
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,517
Where do I open an account?

39
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,358
New accounts,right here.

40
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,921
You're lucky, I was on my way out--

41
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,626
Hold this for me, please?

42
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,931
I'll hold anything you want.

43
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,373
Can you help me?

44
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,199
So...

45
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,467
what kind of account do you want?

46
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:47,838
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
just terrible with things like that.

47
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,210
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

48
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,679
Ipkiss, Stanley lpkiss.

49
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:55,340
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.

50
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,145
Pleasure's all mine.

51
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,116
May l?

52
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,551
What?

53
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:02,487
I'm such a mess.

54
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,156
Oh, of course.

55
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,495
That's what they're there for.

56
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,795
As I was saying, that tie...

57
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:17,861
reminds me of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests.

58
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:20,874
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

59
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,137
It sort of looks like...

60
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,041
a young woman riding bareback.

61
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:28,139
Sort of...

62
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:29,740
Lady Godiva or something.

63
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:32,676
Of course.

64
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:36,190
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

65
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,223
I don't know.

66
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:54,236
Bright colors...

67
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,833
It's a power tie.

68
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,741
Supposed to make you feel...

69
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:59,871
powerful.

70
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,347
Does it work?

71
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:09,650
Now, how about that account?

72
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:10,884
We have...

73
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,052
several different plans.

74
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:14,424
Savings.

75
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,056
Checking.

76
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:21,692
Savings and checking.

77
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,999
Savings and CD's.

78
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,403
Checking and CD's.

79
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,374
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.

80
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:31,310
Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress.

81
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,480
Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out.

82
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:51,331
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.

83
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,333
Keep it down back there.

84
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,097
We'll try.

85
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,333
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But...

86
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,308
the motion detectors are a pain.

87
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,641
But you can pull this off, right?

88
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,647
You talking to the Doctor.

89
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,649
I do have one question.

90
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,514
Which is?

91
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,111
What's Niko have to say about this?

92
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:15,712
Nothing.

93
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,658
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man.

94
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,592
Everything is his grift.

95
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:25,928
He owns you, he owns this club,
he owns this whole stinking town.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,367
Things change.

97
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:33,305
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

98
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,140
He's the only one who's napping...

99
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,942
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call.

100
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:44,143
But we need cash...

101
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:46,482
so first we take the bank...

102
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,021
then we take Niko...

103
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:50,353
and then, my friend,
school is out.

104
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:54,825
And this whole city is our playground.

105
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:03,097
Bub, watch where you're going!

106
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,314
Hang on, hang on!

107
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:23,647
Don't get your panties in a twist.

108
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,919
What the hell is it?

109
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:28,154
I don't know...

110
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,424
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

111
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,234
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

112
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:36,270
I'm here for the Civic.

113
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:40,171
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

114
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,936
What?!

115
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,034
All I wanted was an oil change.

116
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:48,276
Lucky we caught these problems
before they caused serious trouble.

117
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:52,252
Sign right here, and press down hard.

118
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,922
- There's no price.
- There will be.

119
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,515
I've no car.
I need a car tonight.

120
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:04,024
Bring around the loaner.

121
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:05,929
The loaner?

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,093
The loaner?

123
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:39,729
It's a classic.

124
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:53,242
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley lpkiss.

125
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:56,715
Humungo in the banking business.

126
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,945
- Not really.
- Let's get in this joint.

127
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:03,983
How you doing, buddy?

128
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,822
- It's Charlie!
- How you doing?

129
00:10:06,894 --> 00:10:09,454
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.

130
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,124
Good to see you.

131
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,963
Come on, gals.

132
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,094
See you on the inside.

133
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:27,405
This is a mistake.

134
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:33,353
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

135
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:36,549
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him.

136
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:38,353
This isn't fair.

137
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,688
Watch it, I'm a bleeder.

138
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,957
Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here.

139
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,342
Jeez.

140
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:11,317
Mr. Ipkiss!

141
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:13,087
Hi.

142
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:16,023
Are you okay?

143
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:17,689
Me?

144
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,027
I'm great..

145
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,032
Really good.

146
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:22,331
I never felt better, really.

147
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:24,428
I'm just...

148
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,767
catching some air.

149
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,705
Your car, sir.

150
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,108
That's not my car.

151
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,769
It matches the ticket.

152
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,307
Alright...

153
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:39,410
I'll take it.

154
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:43,284
But I am very angry!

155
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,383
Believe this?

156
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:50,019
You drive in in a Porsche...

157
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:35,635
Hey, Mister!

158
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,304
Hold on!

159
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,572
I know CPR!

160
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:22,516
Hey, you!

161
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,108
What are you doing down there?

162
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,785
I'm just looking for...

163
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,752
my mask!

164
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,553
I got it.

165
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:47,941
Do you have any idea what time it is?

166
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:49,737
Actually, no.

167
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:54,076
My new carpet!

168
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:57,948
Well ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit.

169
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,046
You know...

170
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,246
What?

171
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,148
Nothing.

172
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:09,628
Well, that's what you are, lpkiss,
a big nothing.

173
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:17,770
Aren't you due at the lab
to get your bolts tightened?

174
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,567
I should have said that.

175
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,874
Hey, you.

176
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,816
Milo!

177
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,482
No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.

178
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:02,975
What do you want?

179
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,847
You want me to throw that?

180
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,511
I'm very tired.

181
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:09,351
I'll throw it one time.

182
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:12,449
I won't throw it with you
attached to it.

183
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:17,724
You ready?

184
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,356
Get it.

185
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,593
Ipkiss!

186
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,966
Turn down those cartoons!

187
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:25,505
Alright, Mrs. Peenman!

188
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:34,271
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

189
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:36,077
That's correct.

190
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,142
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking.

191
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:42,211
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

192
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,258
and adopt a more socially
acceptable image.

193
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:49,592
The book is "The Masks We Wear"
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

194
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,426
Thank you for being here.

195
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,799
What's the matter with you?

196
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,031
What is it?

197
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:02,372
What are you looking for?

198
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:05,412
You like this thing? You like it?

199
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,246
"The Masks We Wear".

200
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:13,585
"That's correct.

201
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:17,249
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking".

202
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,430
Yeah, right.

203
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:09,637
Smoking!

204
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,738
It's party time.

205
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,179
P-A-R-T-Y

206
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,377
Why? Because I gotta.

207
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,153
MANAGER

208
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:28,990
QUIET PLEASE

209
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:04,227
Snooze!

210
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:32,682
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

211
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:44,967
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate.

212
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:47,804
squeeze me gently

213
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:06,760
Hey, mister...

214
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:08,795
you got the time?

215
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,456
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

216
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:16,834
Look at that!

217
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:21,034
Time to honk your nose and pull
your underwear over your head.

218
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:29,273
Come on!

219
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:39,287
Step right up here, don't be shy!

220
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,519
Nobody likes...

221
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:42,892
a bashful leather head.

222
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,055
Move it!

223
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,497
For my first trick...

224
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:49,900
I'll do something for you, son.

225
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:57,466
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

226
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,614
Now...

227
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,608
Sorry, wrong pocket.

228
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:05,982
For you...

229
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:08,982
a little body English.

230
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:15,227
A French poodle.

231
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:19,528
The dog was rabid, had to put it down.

232
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,735
At last but not least, my favorite.

233
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:37,375
A Tommy gun.

234
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,630
This is incredible.

235
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:54,326
With these powers I could be...

236
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,265
a superhero.

237
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:01,432
I'd fight crime,
protect the innocent...

238
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:05,171
work for world peace.

239
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,837
But first...

240
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:10,039
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

241
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:16,723
Hold onto your lug nuts...

242
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,782
it's time for an overhaul.

243
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:07,730
It was a dream.

244
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,739
It was a dream.

245
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,608
I must lay off the cartoons.

246
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:32,662
Lt. Kellaway. You know anything
about the disturbance last night?

247
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:36,393
Disturbance?

248
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,701
Some prowler broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

249
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,240
Attacked?

250
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:42,969
You didn't hear anything?

251
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:47,343
She unloaded a couple of rounds
of buckshot 5 feet from here.

252
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:49,507
Look at the floor.

253
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,074
He put that right in my floor,
then he jumped out...

254
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:55,610
the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

255
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,486
This is...

256
00:23:57,557 --> 00:23:58,717
impossible.

257
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,659
Those pyjamas are impossible.
This happened.

258
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:05,396
See, I have...

259
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,626
an inner ear problem.

260
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,898
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that so?

261
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:19,578
Here's my card. If you recall
anything unusual about last night...

262
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:22,206
anything at all, call me.

263
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,909
You bet. Thank you.

264
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,077
And good luck...

265
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:28,445
cracking the case.

266
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:44,136
Oh, my God, I'm late!

267
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:47,397
Keys, keys...

268
00:24:47,474 --> 00:24:49,271
Where's the keys?

269
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:51,635
Damn.

270
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,544
Get the keys.

271
00:24:54,614 --> 00:24:55,808
Find them.

272
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:01,015
Get the keys.

273
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,725
I am so late.

274
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,865
Good boy.

275
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:19,201
Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it.

276
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,667
I want a proctologist standing by.

277
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,765
The best one you can find.

278
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:58,675
Can you tell me what happened?

279
00:25:58,745 --> 00:26:02,511
- No, you can quote me.
- Looks like some Mob tactic.

280
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:06,916
She broke the case. Come on,
get these rubbernecks out of here.

281
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:19,525
Where were you last night?
We looked all over for you.

282
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,534
Did you happen to look outside,
in the gutter?

283
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:24,160
Did you check the paper?

284
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:26,068
Your girlfriend got a great review.

285
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:28,164
Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo

286
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:31,074
You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing.

287
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:35,877
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

288
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:38,747
If you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

289
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:41,116
you might get some work done.

290
00:26:41,188 --> 00:26:44,988
Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's.

291
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:46,491
Really?

292
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,226
The next time she comes in...

293
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,767
send her to my office.

294
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,069
You bet.

295
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,334
Gee, I wish "my" daddy
owned a bank.

296
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:08,677
Then I could be a rich
little creep too.

297
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,648
You think she'll ever come back?

298
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:14,312
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.

299
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:18,016
Girls like her always look for
the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.

300
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:20,355
You don't know that.

301
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:23,487
She's an artist. She's...

302
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:25,758
- sensitive.
- Forget her.

303
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:29,928
She'll rip out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappe".

304
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:33,871
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.

305
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,036
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

306
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:39,373
red hair...

307
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,311
full, pouting lips...

308
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:43,713
a white blouse, green jacket...

309
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:45,045
and a name tag.

310
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,382
You really narrowed it down.

311
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,615
Too bad she's already taken.

312
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:54,159
Hello there, may I be of assistance?

313
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:56,252
Stanley lpkiss?

314
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,894
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

315
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:07,803
I canceled my subscription because
they kept stealing--

316
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:10,741
No, actually, I want to ask you
a few questions.

317
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,472
Really? About what?

318
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:17,243
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

319
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,482
Me?

320
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:24,550
I don't even have a car.

321
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:27,252
You know, 'cause they pollute.

322
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:29,818
You don't own an '89 Civic?

323
00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:34,032
Oh, that car, yeah.

324
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:38,629
It's coming back to me.

325
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:41,173
Miss... What was your name?

326
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,538
Peggy Brandt.

327
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:44,803
Wait a minute.

328
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:46,607
Peggy Brandt?

329
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,204
Of "Ask Peggy"?

330
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:51,043
That's right.

331
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:54,018
You printed one of my letters
last year.

332
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,555
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

333
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,156
You're Mister Nice Guy?

334
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:05,888
Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

335
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:09,298
100's of women are looking
for a guy like you.

336
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:13,532
Really?

337
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:16,769
You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

338
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:19,539
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.

339
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:27,320
Why are you covering this story?

340
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:31,118
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

341
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:33,352
I'm looking to become a real reporter.

342
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:37,453
When you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

343
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,724
Anything?

344
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:40,766
I won't make trouble for you.

345
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,358
I just want the truth.

346
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:47,705
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.

347
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:53,573
If you think of anything...

348
00:29:53,646 --> 00:29:55,511
this is my number.

349
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:57,375
This is my...

350
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,884
you know, personal number.

351
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,556
100's of women are looking
for a guy like me?

352
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:05,989
Sure.

353
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:08,924
I'm one of them.

354
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:19,268
120 yards.

355
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:26,070
Hello, Dorian.

356
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:32,015
Thanks for dropping by.

357
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:36,385
Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home.

358
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:00,004
The cops...

359
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,913
tried to shut the club
down this morning.

360
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:08,647
They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams.

361
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:11,246
When I hear things like that...

362
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:14,782
I start losing my concentration.

363
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:17,523
My game...

364
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:20,725
it goes straight to hell.

365
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:25,427
You could too.

366
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,099
205 yards.

367
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:31,268
I'm fed up with you...

368
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,612
but....

369
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,341
I'll cut you a break.

370
00:31:37,016 --> 00:31:40,008
One week to get out of town.

371
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:42,145
After that...

372
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:46,886
I'll use your empty little skull
to break in my new nine iron.

373
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,725
Are you okay?

374
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:31,361
Your car, sir.

375
00:32:34,908 --> 00:32:36,876
I am now.

376
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,088
Tina, come on.

377
00:32:58,231 --> 00:32:59,823
You can't.

378
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,325
You can't.

379
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,370
Go on.

380
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,502
I don't believe it.

381
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:33,129
Stupid.

382
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:36,868
She would never...

383
00:34:02,862 --> 00:34:04,796
No way!

384
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,258
Hold on, Sugar.

385
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:38,525
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

386
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,809
Somebody,stop me.

387
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:05,519
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

388
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,786
I better make a little stop.

389
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:18,070
EDGE CITY POWER
"SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"

390
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:19,798
How's it going, Freeze?

391
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:21,362
It's looking good here.

392
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:25,707
You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.

393
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:26,836
Do it.

394
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:30,405
The doctor is about to operate.

395
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,402
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

396
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:08,918
Cops!

397
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,395
Not on the list, not in the club.

398
00:36:39,152 --> 00:36:40,585
How do?

399
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:47,889
You on the list?

400
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,125
No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

401
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,860
Franklin, Grant...

402
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,231
and Jackson.

403
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:06,105
That's it! No one gets in.

404
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:13,545
Now we present the most beautiful
flower of the Congo Bongo...

405
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,746
Miss Tina Carlyle.

406
00:37:30,536 --> 00:37:31,798
Beautiful.

407
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:36,498
Love makes me treat you...

408
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:40,012
The way that I do
Gee, baby...

409
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,378
ain't I good to you

410
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:46,509
There's nothing too good...

411
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:49,146
for a boy that's so true

412
00:37:49,222 --> 00:37:53,352
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

413
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:56,953
I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

414
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:59,554
A diamond ring...

415
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:01,463
a Cadillac car...

416
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:04,628
And everything

417
00:38:04,704 --> 00:38:07,468
Love makes me treat you...

418
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,906
the way that I do

419
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:12,877
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

420
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:18,044
Love makes me treat you...

421
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:20,381
the way that I do

422
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:23,479
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

423
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:28,083
There's nothing too good...

424
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,061
for a man so true

425
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,826
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

426
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:40,634
I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right

427
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:45,773
- Why are you here?
- There's trouble.

428
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:47,403
You better come upstairs.

429
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:50,240
Come on, let's go.

430
00:38:55,922 --> 00:38:58,755
They got me paying taxes...

431
00:38:58,824 --> 00:39:00,621
for what I gave to you

432
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:04,629
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

433
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,914
Let's rock this joint.

434
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:42,058
Smoking.

435
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:46,530
What happened?

436
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:51,965
Someone hit the joint before us.

437
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,904
Get that, Doc.

438
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:58,436
Suck on that.

439
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,447
Son of a bitch!

440
00:41:09,588 --> 00:41:11,180
Who did this, man?

441
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,986
Who?!

442
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:15,190
Him!

443
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:17,855
That's the guy.

444
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,228
The guy dancing with Tina?

445
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:22,096
He's dead meat.

446
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,328
Come on.

447
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,807
I want this place cleared now.

448
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:27,962
Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

449
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:30,092
Party's over, let's go!

450
00:42:30,803 --> 00:42:32,134
Get out of here.

451
00:42:33,706 --> 00:42:34,673
Get lost!

452
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,872
Okay, Twinkle Toes.

453
00:42:37,943 --> 00:42:40,411
Where is my money, tell me now.

454
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:50,013
You've got 17.5 %  in T-bills
amortized over the fiscal year.

455
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,317
8 %  in stocks and bonds.

456
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,950
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

457
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:57,587
Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible.

458
00:42:58,464 --> 00:43:00,125
Ice this deadbeat.

459
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:07,504
Shoot him!

460
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:13,844
Thanks.

461
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:24,114
You got me, partner.

462
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:38,968
Hold me close,Red.

463
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:40,903
It's getting dark.

464
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:48,809
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

465
00:43:53,018 --> 00:43:56,044
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas.

466
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,886
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.

467
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:08,365
Pardon me.

468
00:44:17,076 --> 00:44:18,668
Thank you.

469
00:44:20,479 --> 00:44:21,707
You love me.

470
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,772
You really love me.

471
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:32,820
You're not going anywhere.

472
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:40,857
Drop it, Tyrel!

473
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:47,271
Drop it.

474
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:53,434
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

475
00:44:54,747 --> 00:44:57,443
What I got is probable cause.

476
00:44:57,516 --> 00:44:59,882
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.

477
00:44:59,952 --> 00:45:01,783
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

478
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:04,482
And one was wearing a big,
green mask.

479
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:07,184
For once, you're right.

480
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:09,659
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

481
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:13,323
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

482
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:14,798
Cuff him.

483
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:18,428
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.

484
00:45:18,504 --> 00:45:21,337
Call that high-priced
lawyer of yours.

485
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:23,739
We'll go downtown for a chat.

486
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:25,674
Get him out of here.

487
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:48,892
I know you're in there.

488
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,260
Police!

489
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:56,607
Open up!

490
00:45:56,675 --> 00:45:59,371
Oh, my God.

491
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:05,572
I know you're in there!

492
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:13,317
Open up!

493
00:46:13,392 --> 00:46:17,328
Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers.

494
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:22,591
Stop it.

495
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:24,931
I'm coming, okay.

496
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:27,528
I'll be right there.

497
00:46:31,643 --> 00:46:33,907
Let's go, move it!

498
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:35,913
Alright!

499
00:46:41,653 --> 00:46:43,245
Hi, Lieutenant.

500
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:47,019
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

501
00:46:47,092 --> 00:46:49,026
Won't you come in?

502
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:53,330
Where were you last night?

503
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:55,961
Here, mostly.

504
00:46:56,034 --> 00:46:57,001
Something wrong?

505
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:59,060
What do you know about The Mask?

506
00:46:59,138 --> 00:47:01,231
"Mask?"

507
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:03,001
Don't insult my intelligence.

508
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:06,875
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

509
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:09,573
There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas.

510
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,180
May I see those pajamas?

511
00:47:16,488 --> 00:47:18,046
Those pajamas?

512
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:21,024
Those pajamas...

513
00:47:22,294 --> 00:47:23,454
were stolen.

514
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:26,191
Somebody stole your pajamas?

515
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,770
What is this city coming to...

516
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:41,074
when a man's pajama drawer is
no longer safe!

517
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:47,876
Look at that guy.

518
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:51,116
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say.

519
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:56,394
That's one hell of a rubber mask.

520
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:57,759
Lab reports?

521
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:02,392
We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches Tyrel's men.

522
00:48:02,468 --> 00:48:03,992
He beat them to the punch.

523
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:08,904
Get the bank employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named lpkiss.

524
00:48:08,974 --> 00:48:11,465
You figure it was an inside job?

525
00:48:11,543 --> 00:48:15,138
I need some prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday.

526
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:19,641
50 grand...

527
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:24,348
to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops.

528
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:27,756
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

529
00:48:27,826 --> 00:48:30,590
every low life in this town.
Understand?

530
00:48:30,662 --> 00:48:33,790
I want him here tomorrow, alive.

531
00:48:35,634 --> 00:48:37,033
You still here?

532
00:48:37,102 --> 00:48:39,036
Come on, let's go.

533
00:48:44,142 --> 00:48:45,837
What are you looking at?

534
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,003
You.

535
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:48,671
You're losing it.

536
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:52,513
I'm not losing anything...

537
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:54,449
except maybe some extra baggage.

538
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,112
What's that mean?

539
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:01,790
You didn't fight much last night
when that freak kissed you.

540
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,091
Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

541
00:49:06,331 --> 00:49:07,923
Maybe you did...

542
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:12,930
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

543
00:49:14,606 --> 00:49:15,903
I'll tell you one thing.

544
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:20,374
It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me.

545
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:34,618
We have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late?

546
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:36,661
If I must put up with--

547
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:39,526
Back off, monkey boy...

548
00:49:39,598 --> 00:49:43,295
or I'll tell your dad you treat
this place like your piggy bank.

549
00:49:43,368 --> 00:49:45,268
Or we should call the IRS...

550
00:49:45,337 --> 00:49:48,568
and arrange a vacation for you
at Club Fed?

551
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:53,643
That'll be all.

552
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:58,678
Genius.

553
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,413
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.

554
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:06,355
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

555
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:07,858
I'm not sure.

556
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:11,328
I haven't exactly been myself lately.

557
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:13,421
You don't look real fabulous.

558
00:50:13,498 --> 00:50:15,489
Really, do I look bad?

559
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:20,262
Don't worry. This'll put the color
back in your cheeks.
