00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,441
[man] Okay.
The right combination

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:11,542
is to say X
is one of those

4
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:13,545
and two of these.

5
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:17,349
Um, well, let's take
the equation number two.

6
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:23,355
If I make a picture that
satisfies all the X, Y, Z points

7
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:25,558
that solve this equation,

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,027
well, first of all,
the origin is not one of them.

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,866
X, Y, Z, it being zero, zero,
zero, would not solve it.

10
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,936
So, what are some of the
points that do solve it?

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,440
Now, let's see
maybe if X is one and...

12
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,709
[student]
Oh!

13
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,711
[woman] <i>Katelyn Ogden
was a lot of things,</i>

14
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,515
<i>but she wasn't
particularly explosive...</i>

15
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,449
[screams]

16
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,684
[students clamoring]

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,352
<i>...in any sense
of the word.</i>

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,654
[teacher chattering]

19
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,623
<i>She was a sun dress
of a person...</i>

20
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>cute, airy, inoffensive.</i>

21
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,797
<i>She was quickly becoming
the Dalton twins'</i>

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,566
<i>number one marijuana customer
at Covington High.</i>

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,135
<i>But that's hardly a reason
to pop like a zit.</i>

24
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,038
She's all over me!

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,106
<i>Spraying all over us.</i>

26
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,810
<i>I wasn't close
with Katelyn.</i>

27
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,245
<i>She was just,
you know, a classmate.</i>

28
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,981
<i>Someone I sat behind or
passed in the halls every day</i>

29
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,884
<i>from kindergarten
to senior year.</i>

30
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,454
<i>We ran
in different circles.</i>

31
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:29,590
<i>But lots of people liked her.
Guys especially.</i>

32
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,626
I was gonna ask her
to prom.

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,927
She was so hot.

34
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,531
I even narrowed down motel
room options to two choices.

35
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,069
[whimpering]
She was so open-minded.

36
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,504
<i>Jed Hayes was
particularly crushed.</i>

37
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,307
[students screaming]

38
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,042
- Mara!
- Oh, my God, Tess!

39
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:51,045
- What... What happened?
- Katelyn exploded.

40
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,346
What? Like a bomb?

41
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,281
No. Like... a balloon?

42
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,718
What?

43
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,587
Oh, my God, your shoes.

44
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:03,092
[Mara] <i>Everyone
quickly realized</i>

45
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:05,726
<i>Katelyn Ogden was not
a suicide bomber,</i>

46
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,065
<i>seeing as the only thing
that blew up was Katelyn Ogden.</i>

47
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,067
<i>Her desk remained unscathed
by the Ogdenblast.</i>

48
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,502
[both exclaim]

49
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:19,174
<i>The only damage her
clothes took was cosmetic.</i>

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,177
This isn't right.
She was just a kid.

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,713
<i>It wasn't right.
She was just a kid.</i>

52
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,548
This is fucking
disgusting.

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,017
<i>And it was very
fucking disgusting.</i>

54
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,520
<i>After
the unprecedented event,</i>

55
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:36,191
<i>all of our third-period class
got taken to the police station.</i>

56
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,293
<i>Which was very exciting.</i>

57
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:40,628
<i>We got asked a lot
of important questions like...</i>

58
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,064
Did Katelyn ever say
anything suspicious?

59
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,634
About wanting to blow up?
All the time.

60
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:51,942
I was kidding.

61
00:02:57,113 --> 00:03:00,282
<i>Then they took all our clothes
and let us shower.</i>

62
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,319
Will I get these back?

63
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,020
Do you want these back?

64
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,627
<i>I only washed my hair.</i>

65
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,830
<i>Then they gave us a bunch of ugly-as-shit
sweat suits and made us wait.</i>

66
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,834
[sighs]

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,310
It was like
a Cronenberg movie.

68
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:29,979
[chuckles]

69
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:40,724
What do you think
happened?

70
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,193
- Aliens?
- It wasn't aliens, bro.

71
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,562
[boy 1] I'm just saying.
She was there, then she wasn't.

72
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,765
It's not fair.
She was so nice.

73
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,567
I was gonna ask her
to prom.

74
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,302
She was very
open-minded.

75
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,671
When the hell are they gonna
let us out of here?

76
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:56,841
When they know it's
not gonna happen again.

77
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:58,908
When what's gonna
happen again?

78
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:03,180
[imitates explosion]

79
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,086
[retching]

80
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:10,486
[vomiting]

81
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,421
[Mara] <i>It happened again.</i>

82
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,859
It happened again a lot.

83
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,823
I'm not going to school
tomorrow.

84
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:47,324
No shit, sweetheart.

85
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,385
- Are you hungry?
- No, not really.

86
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,022
Do you wanna talk?

87
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,859
I think I just wanna
go to bed.

88
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,362
Okay, kiddo.

89
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,300
- You know, we thought it was a shooter.
- [sighs] Dad...

90
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,602
We didn't have any information.
They didn't tell us anything.

91
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:33,070
And...

92
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:38,243
I'm just trying to say that
we're so glad you're okay.

93
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:43,850
And that your classmates are just
regular assholes and not evil.

94
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,387
That is a silver lining.

95
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:55,995
Good night.

96
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:04,470
[alternative rock music
plays softly]

97
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,319
[phone chimes]

98
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,527
- Ugh.
- [typing]

99
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:38,037
[chuckles]

100
00:06:55,656 --> 00:07:00,094
[singing "Hey, That's
No Way to Say Goodbye"]

101
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,851
- Is this song...
- Yeah, it is definitely sexual.

102
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,721
Right on.

103
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:30,390
[song continues,
sung by Run Night Run]

104
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:08,297
I always wondered what happens
to those when someone dies.

105
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,299
Fuck me.

106
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,568
I need drugs.

107
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,104
Shrooms?

108
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,838
- Oh! Shrooms?
- No.

109
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:21,075
Yeah. It's like weed,
but a fungi.

110
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,710
I've never had shrooms.

111
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:25,247
I honestly cannot think
of a better time to start.

112
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,350
It's a terrible time
to start.

113
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:31,320
I would love to start.

114
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,360
You're gonna make
yourself sick.

115
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,162
Nuh-uh. You brew 'em in liquid
so that you don't get sick.

116
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,064
That's what
Native Americans do.

117
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:43,833
- In pumpkin spice lattes?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,967
Pumpkins.
Thanksgiving. Duh.

119
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,404
- Duh.
- [chuckles]

120
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:50,272
- Here.
- [gasps]

121
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,875
Oh, my God. I fucking love it.
[chuckles]

122
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:57,345
[Mara] <i>Tess McNulty and I have been
best friends since elementary school.</i>

123
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,414
Will you be
my best friend forever?

124
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,150
Obviously.

125
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,889
<i>When Tess' shitbrain dad
walked out on her and her mom,</i>

126
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:09,559
<i>we spent a few days
at the beach,</i>

127
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,228
<i>and we saw these baller
old chicks in kimonos</i>

128
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:14,998
<i>smoking a hookah
with their toes in the sand.</i>

129
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's do this.

130
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,902
<i>It remains our life plan.</i>

131
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,405
- To Katelyn.
- To Katelyn.

132
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,578
No. No.

133
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,613
Stop. Stop!

134
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,616
This is... Put...

135
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,653
Are you done?

136
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:41,158
[sighs] I didn't know Katelyn
that well beyond social media.

137
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,760
Yeah, I know. Me neither.

138
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:45,229
- Did she get into college yet?
- I don't know.

139
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:47,363
I know she wanted
to be a journalist though.

140
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:50,200
Oh. We have too many excellent
journalists as it is.

141
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,507
Did Katelyn at least
get laid before everything?

142
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,375
Oh, yeah.
She was a total slut.

143
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,445
- You know what? Good for her!
- I agree.

144
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,248
Get it while
the getting is good.

145
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,348
The only downside
is high school boys.

146
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:08,853
I know. I cannot wait to be old.
I can't wait to be a cougar.

147
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:12,456
I'm gonna be like, "Come hither, young
man, and pleasure me eagerly. Whoo!"

148
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,292
Hey, mind if I join
you guys?

149
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,598
Tess, don't look now,
but there's a boy staring at us.

150
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:25,735
I think he's staring
at you.

151
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,806
Ah. Right you are.

152
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,075
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey, Mara.

153
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,611
- Hey, Tess.
- Hi, Dylan.

154
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:34,845
Thanks.

155
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,547
- How you guys doing?
- All right.

156
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:39,182
Definitely the best memorial
service I've ever been to.

157
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:40,518
Best funeral, too.

158
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:44,189
Second best for me.
My dad's was better.

159
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,690
Well, holy shit, Dylan.

160
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:50,094
Oh, it's okay. The Ogdens can
just try harder next time.

161
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,864
Well, holy shit, Dylan.

162
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,331
Am I bombing
this banter thing?

163
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,368
Like the end of
<i>Dr. Strangelove.</i>

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,068
Don't you think that movie
is kind of ruined now?

165
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,770
Yeah, I kind of do.

166
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,039
What's going on?

167
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:02,607
Yeah, actually,
what is going on?

168
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:06,611
Oh, I thought talking to you
at the funeral might be icky.

169
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:08,947
- Icky?
- It's an adjective.

170
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,783
Yeah, I know it's an adj...

171
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,853
Oh, holy shit!

172
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,956
- You're the guy! You have a crush on me!
- Hello.

173
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,359
- [Tess] What's going on?
- This is the guy. This is dick pic Dylan.

174
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,760
Ew! You sent her
a dick pic?

175
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,596
No, that would be gross!

176
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,332
He sent me pictures
of Richards.

177
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:29,134
- That's worse!
- How is that worse?

178
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,403
- Why did you text me that?
- The Richards?

179
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:33,706
No. The declarative
statement.

180
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,612
Katelyn exploded
in the middle of precalc,

181
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:42,282
and it got me thinking about
life, in an ironic way,

182
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,452
and what would happen
if I popped, you know.

183
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,687
And then you said,
it might happen again,

184
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,559
and I was like, I gotta get shit
done, in case she's right.

185
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:02,736
Do you wanna go
to the ladies' room with me?

186
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,371
Uh...

187
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,239
Come on. It'll be fun.

188
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:07,840
She's gonna go to the
bathroom and throw up

189
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,608
because she just drank
a shitload of mushrooms,

190
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,944
and she wants you
to hold her hair back.

191
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,948
- [snaps fingers]
- Oh. In that case...

192
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,983
[vomiting]

193
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:22,121
I'm not usually like this.
I can usually really hold my drugs.

194
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,658
[chuckles]

195
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,459
Also, I usually never
do drugs.

196
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:27,762
We live in strange
and unusual times.

197
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:29,497
That is so true.

198
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,734
[chuckles]

199
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,936
There are a lot of you.

200
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,639
[chuckling]

201
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:40,774
How many?

202
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,643
I'll throw up if I count,
but more than one.

203
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:45,579
That's awesome.

204
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:48,583
- You should make out.
- All right.

205
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:51,785
How do I do that?

206
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,188
With your tongues.

207
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,889
Oh, shit.

208
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:10,069
I saw Katelyn's dad scratch her stick
figure sticker off the back of his car.

209
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:14,209
I always wondered what happens
to those when someone dies.

210
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:17,445
- What happens is, I get shroomed.
- [chuckles]

211
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,048
Hey, did you see Katelyn...

212
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:22,283
Go boom? No.

213
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,253
Did you?

214
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,522
I only heard it.

215
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:32,327
It's weird being right there
and missing it.

216
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,464
[gasps] Like,
I'm sad I missed it,

217
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:37,598
and that makes me
feel terrible.

218
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:42,438
Yeah. No, it must be
so invigorating.

219
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,939
Invigorating.

220
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,545
- Oh. Okay.
- [retches]

221
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:55,783
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,626
Thanks for saying
you like me.

223
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,126
Sure.

224
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,697
Hey, would you want to come
with me to the homecoming game?

225
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,302
What?

226
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:17,273
I'm trying to think
of a reason to say no.

227
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,110
- I could give you some.
- Shoot.

228
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:25,715
Well, maybe just
homecoming sucks?

229
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,150
Yeah, but it's fun
to make fun of.

230
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:31,220
- Plus, Halloween.
- Mm. Yeah, okay.

231
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:36,826
Then maybe I'm just a guy who is
interested in grief-induced sex.

232
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:40,462
Way sluttier girls than me,
though.

233
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,965
Probably wouldn't stick around
while I hurled either.

234
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,301
True.

235
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:47,837
Well, maybe you just
don't really know me.

236
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,473
But I do know you.

237
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:53,077
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

238
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,245
You're in a bunch
of my classes.

239
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,947
You're a movie nerd.
You're pretty cute.

240
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:01,851
Your dad died when a bunch
of manure fell on him.

241
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:05,789
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I just realized I said that out loud.

242
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:09,593
- Now you have to come to the game with me.
- I really do.

243
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:12,129
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

244
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,363
I blame the shrooms.

245
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,800
Okay. Yes. Thank you.

246
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,403
My dad was a farmer.

247
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:21,605
But he died
of a heart attack.

248
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:24,941
The rumor of him being crushed
to death by shit is false.

249
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:28,678
And impossible, if you've seen
any <i>Back to the Future</i> movie.

250
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,649
Kids are cruel.

251
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,955
- I'm... I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

252
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:39,957
We're all cruel.

253
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:47,965
Today was weird.

254
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,737
Tonight was all right.

255
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:56,508
Yeah.
Tonight was all right.

256
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,484
This isn't gonna become
a regular thing, right?

257
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:08,853
The intoxication?

258
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,492
No. No. I just needed...

259
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,093
[sighs]

260
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:17,929
I don't know what I needed.

261
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,633
Have you cried yet?

262
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,805
Have you?

263
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:28,641
I cry all the time.

264
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,646
[Tess] <i>It's just not the same
without the blood.</i>

265
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,550
[Mara] <i>I just look like
a stupid prom queen.</i>

266
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:40,118
I should have just dressed up
as a sexy witch too.

267
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:43,789
I'm just a normal witch.
I'm not even cleavagey.

268
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,425
Girl, your sexiness
is unavoidable.

269
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,530
Shit. They've built her
a shrine.

270
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,600
[Tess chuckles]
Hey, there's dick pic.

271
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,569
Hello, Quaker Oats.

272
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:58,770
Are you supposed
to be Carrie?

273
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,805
Yes! Oh, my God,
thank you!

274
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,209
Yeah. No, it's great.
I mean, it would have been really cool...

275
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,844
- Don't say it.
- I know. Katelyn fucked it up.

276
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,381
I mean, she didn't
intentionally...

277
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,051
You're making it worse.

278
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,556
Your hat. Ha-ha!

279
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:19,092
Hey, will you stop?
I don't know you.

280
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:22,028
[shouting, exclaiming]

281
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,930
[laughs]

282
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:28,301
So, what gives,
Hipster Oats?

283
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,369
Our football team
are the Quakers.

284
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,471
[chuckles]
No, not your costume.

285
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:34,707
The crush
you say you have on me.

286
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:39,112
I want, like, a timeline.

287
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:44,617
So...

288
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,152
First day of school.

289
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,122
New town
after my dad died.

290
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:52,792
First time I saw you is right after Spiros
introduced me in front of the class.

291
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:55,160
You must be Dylan.
Welcome.

292
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:58,031
Class, I'd like for you
to meet Mr. Dylan Hovemeyer.

293
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:02,836
He's new here, so please,
don't be yourselves. Be nice.

294
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,906
[hisses]

295
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:09,943
It was a good
first impression.

296
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:13,780
A few weeks later,
I saw you at the Moonlight,

297
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,617
<i>and when Jed tried wrapping
his arm around you...</i>

298
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,988
[shouting]

299
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:23,924
And then, on the day
after the election...

300
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,359
[whistle blows]

301
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,094
Mara,
why are you wearing that?

302
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:29,330
Because
I'm motherfucking grieving.

303
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,330
You got detention
for the profanity.

304
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,300
Motherfucking worth it.

305
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:37,238
It's clichéd,
but you wrote a poem last spring

306
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:41,809
that made me feel like you understood
me, even though we barely talked.

307
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,111
I friended you
on Facebook afterwards.

308
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:46,013
I looked at your pictures
sometimes.

309
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,850
I even gave you my number,
but I think you forgot

310
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:51,086
or never saved it
in your phone.

311
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,190
I hoped we'd run into each other
during the summer but never did.

312
00:18:55,324 --> 00:19:00,596
And then it was senior year and I
thought, why try? We're going to college.

313
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:06,802
And that made me sad,
because you seemed so cool and original.

314
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,804
But then...

315
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,006
- [people clamoring]
- [gasps]

316
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:14,443
When Katelyn died,
I didn't see you anywhere.

317
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:15,777
[alarm bell ringing]

318
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,148
You had two backpacks.
One of them was hers.

319
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,086
Are you okay?

320
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:26,620
I don't know
what to do with this.

321
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,790
I can take care of it
for you.

322
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:40,102
When what
happens again?

323
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,870
[imitates explosion]

324
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:47,309
And when you said
it might happen again,

325
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:51,080
I thought, whoa,
maybe I've been wasting my entire life

326
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:54,250
preparing for a year
that may never come for me.

327
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:55,651
So fuck it.

328
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,452
I'm gonna tell you
how I feel.

329
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,088
I'm gonna spend
my savings on a car.

330
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:03,225
I'm not gonna be
scared anymore. I'm not...

331
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,696
Wait, are-are you even
listening to me?

332
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,964
Oh. Yeah. Sorry. No.

333
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,001
[chuckles] Seriously,
that was wonderful.

334
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,502
I don't want you to think
I was not paying attention...

335
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:18,107
'Cause it kind of looks like you're
just taking pictures of the game.

336
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,376
No! No. Not of the game.
Never of the game.

337
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:26,416
I'm waiting for
the "We Love Cocks" moment.

338
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,587
I would have never guessed that
was what was about to be said.

339
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,790
- [both chuckle]
- Okay. Look.

340
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:35,993
Every game, Harper Wie,
Perry Love and Steve Cox,

341
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,796
for just one brief moment,
line up

342
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:41,098
for the
"We Love Cocks" moment.

343
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,234
- That's so immature.
- It really is.

344
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,177
I have a moment for you...

345
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:56,947
where I knew
I liked you.

346
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,317
You like me?

347
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,385
Maybe.

348
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,890
It was, like,
forever ago.

349
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:11,962
And I was just chilling, and then you
looked me in the eye and you said,

350
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:13,465
"Mara...

351
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:17,201
we love cocks."

352
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:21,072
Mara...

353
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,775
we love cocks.

354
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:29,281
- [explosion]
- [people clamoring]

355
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,249
- [man] Oh, fuck!
- Did something happen?

356
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:33,284
[clamoring, screaming]

357
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,023
[gasps]

358
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:13,324
[Mara] <i>Perry Love was that guy
that just made everything better.</i>

359
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,995
<i>He was like air conditioning.
And then he was news.</i>

360
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:19,563
<i>We all became news.</i>

361
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:22,668
<i>The popping was given the sexy
moniker of "The Covington Curse."</i>

362
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:25,004
[scoffs] <i>Stupid fucking curse.</i>

363
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:26,972
<i>By the way,
Perry Love was gay.</i>

364
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,041
<i>I didn't even know that
until the memorial.</i>

365
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:33,111
And when my bro came out to us
in sixth grade, we loved him.

366
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:34,980
Oh, come on.

367
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:37,015
Because he was
our best bro.

368
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:39,918
And we're progressive
like that.

369
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:42,522
Our boy...

370
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,727
Our boy was too much rock
for this world, bitch!

371
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,062
[shouting, cheering]

372
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,499
<i>It was a nice moment.</i>

373
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:55,767
<i>Of course, what we didn't
know at the time was...</i>

374
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,970
School's canceled.

375
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:02,176
For how long?

376
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,813
But we're just gonna keep
applying to colleges.

377
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:11,051
So you'll be all set
once this blows over.

378
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:18,792
Well, at least now
you can't say,

379
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,361
"Things were so much harder
back in my day."

380
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:24,998
You're right.

381
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:28,067
You have it way worse.

382
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,574
[vehicle approaching]

383
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:49,858
[speakers:
rock music playing]

384
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:55,696
Oh, my God.

385
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,734
Of course you don't drive a
Hyundai or something like that.

386
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:01,903
It reminded me
of this Springsteen song.

387
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:04,305
- Which one?
- The one about the milk truck driver.

388
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,474
There's a Springsteen song
about a milk truck driver?

389
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:10,143
- Guess you'll have to find out.
- I swear to God, I'm never gonna find out.

390
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:11,979
I just bought it today.

391
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,082
- Why?
- [chuckles]

392
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,452
Uh, I was saving up
for a college car,

393
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:20,554
but then I thought
I might die tomorrow.

394
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:22,990
- So I went to the dealer...
- Of milk trucks.

395
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:26,828
And I saw it and I laughed and I
thought other people would laugh too.

396
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:29,464
It was cheap, so why not?

397
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,300
Just get me through
till graduation, baby.

398
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,302
That should be
our school slogan.

399
00:24:34,436 --> 00:24:36,471
[chuckles]
It really should.

400
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:37,739
You ready to go?

401
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:39,606
In your milk truck?

402
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,877
- Fuck, yeah.
- [man] <i>Fuck, no!</i>

403
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,513
We are never
forgetting them!

404
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:47,549
- Whoo!
- [people cheering]

405
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:49,550
[dance music playing]

406
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,553
- I love you, bro.
- I love you too, man.

407
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:54,690
I love you guys too.

408
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:00,060
I really need this drink.
Can I take it? Please?

409
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,063
- Why, why, why?
- Please, please. I'm gonna grab it.

410
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:04,333
- Okay?
- Okay.

411
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:05,935
Have fun.

412
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,413
You wanna go for a walk?

413
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,213
I love walks.

414
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:30,525
- How's your drink?
- It's very tequila-y.

415
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,195
[chuckles] Wait,
are you drinking...

416
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:33,962
Yeah, you're drinking
straight tequila.

417
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:36,399
I mean... no?

418
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:38,967
I'm just drinking beer.

419
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,603
Drink big, bro!

420
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,905
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

421
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,375
What if alcohol
is what makes it happen?

422
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,611
[gasps] No!

423
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,715
[both laughing]

424
00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,755
What do you think does?

425
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,992
Um, I don't know.

426
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,694
- That's not good enough!
- Well, I don't!

427
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:08,699
It's the cosmic bullshit
of the universe, right?

428
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:11,167
- Lame.
- I'm sorry.

429
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:19,042
I'm writing this book
called <i>All The Feels.</i>

430
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:21,477
It's about this guy who,
when he touches people,

431
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,281
he takes all their feelings,
and then they die.

432
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:29,186
I just wanted you to know something
about me no one else does.

433
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,623
- Are you drunk?
- Oh, dude, yeah.

434
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:34,658
- Are you?
- No.

435
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:38,162
How many cups
have you had?

436
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,565
I don't know.

437
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:43,367
Oh, shit.

438
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,272
Tell me something,
just for me.

439
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:54,378
Okay, well, um,
after my dad died,

440
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:59,184
I would go to this old
barn with a tape player

441
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,453
and dance by myself.

442
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,356
Like, to Bon Jovi.

443
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,458
Yeah, I'd just
cry and dance

444
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,361
and then rewind
and cry and dance.

445
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:14,598
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

446
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:17,402
And people are
literally blowing up.

447
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:22,907
Actually, uh,
they're not just people.

448
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,841
They're seniors.

449
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,244
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

450
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:31,249
Also,
we stopped walking.

451
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,454
- The shocks keep coming.
- [chuckles]

452
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,567
I really wanna
kiss you, man.

453
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,270
Yeah?

454
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,406
Yeah.

455
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,293
[people chanting]

456
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,097
[people cheering]

457
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,133
- [exclaims]
- [chuckles]

458
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,670
We should... We should
probably go, right?

459
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,905
No.

460
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,311
You taste like tequila.

461
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:36,817
- [explosion]
- [people screaming]

462
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,597
Fuck me.

463
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,040
[camera shutter clicks]

464
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,709
[woman] <i>Special Agent Rosetti.
Thank you, ladies, for coming in.</i>

465
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,812
Let me be the first to say,
I'm... I'm truly sorry.

466
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,916
- It's okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it could be worse, right?

467
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,385
We could be Republicans.

468
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,289
[chuckles]
That was funny.

469
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,023
Thank you.

470
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:19,793
So, you ladies
blow people up?

471
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,428
Uh, no, ma'am.

472
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,531
Do you think there's someone
killing everyone?

473
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,768
I think we've effectively
ruled that out.

474
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:31,237
I mean, unless there's a mad
scientist or a warlock on the loose.

475
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:32,639
Kids are literally
blowing up,

476
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:35,542
so, I mean, that could be
a possibility, right?

477
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,944
If you believe
in warlocks.

478
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,014
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

479
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:45,452
Do you have any idea
why it's happening, though?

480
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,188
At the moment, no.

481
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:51,859
But we're close
to figuring it out.

482
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:56,396
Or so I'm told.

483
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,868
Wait, so what you're saying
is, we're fucked.

484
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:02,905
No. What I'm saying
is that I need help.

485
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:07,809
Listen. Everyone's scared,
and scared people all want the same thing.

486
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,577
Which is?

487
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:11,714
To survive.

488
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,683
- Right.
- Yeah.

489
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:17,085
- We would actually love to survive.
- Yeah.

490
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:19,019
- That'd be sick.
- [Rosetti] Good.

491
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,656
So bring me something.

492
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,426
Uh, what do you want?

493
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,763
[laughing]
Drugs?

494
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:29,264
That's what she said.

495
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:31,466
She thinks drugs
is making us pop?

496
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,868
I think it's less
accusational and more,

497
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:37,839
what the holy fuck is going on,
let's rule shit out-onal.

498
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:41,743
So, you're not gonna tell this
Scully wannabe they came from us?

499
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:45,713
Girl, do I look like
Benicio Del Toro to you?

500
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:49,352
[chuckling] I don't know
what that means.

501
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:52,589
I don't either.
I need to rewatch <i>Traffic.</i>

502
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:55,390
We're gonna sidebar.

503
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:57,694
- Do your thing.
- Okay.

504
00:31:00,563 --> 00:31:02,032
What? What do you think?

505
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,834
I think we gotta
get rid of them.

506
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:06,969
- I got her to go for it too.
- Okay.

507
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:10,840
All right, uh, we're down.
What do you want?

508
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:14,711
That's the best part.
America's reimbursing me.

509
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:19,048
- So you're buying...
- Everything.

510
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:25,286
God bless America!

511
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,323
Okay.
I'm gonna get the keys.

512
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:28,757
Keys?

513
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,062
Uh, we don't keep our shit
at home.

514
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,698
We hide it.

515
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:37,001
Never know when the feds
are gonna fuck ya.

516
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:40,504
I have a question.

517
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:42,072
Suitcase-related?

518
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,640
Suitcase-related.

519
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:46,110
- Leaving Jersey tomorrow.
- Yeah.

520
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:47,744
Getting the fuck
outta Dodge.

521
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,713
Do you guys think
it's Covington?

522
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,583
I don't know what it is,
but I also don't really want to find out.

523
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:56,387
So how you been holding up
during all this garbage?

524
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,721
Hanging in, yo.

525
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:01,057
Started making out
with a real sweet boy.

526
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,059
No shit! Who?

527
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:06,529
- Hovemeyer.
- [all laughing]

528
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,865
You know,
the world is a cra...

529
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:20,611
[shouts] Fuck!
Go, go, go!

530
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:22,347
Fuck.
It's flooded with Joe.

531
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:24,316
Hurry! Jenna, come on!

532
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:27,451
Wait. I can't see anything.
I can't...

533
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:30,388
- Put your foot on the brake.
- His shoes are there.

534
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,656
I'll move his shoes.
Just steer.

535
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,558
- [Jenna shouts]
- [gasps]

536
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:53,578
[country music playing
on radio]

537
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:04,122
[country music
continues playing]

538
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,010
Mara!

539
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:26,879
Mara!

540
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,184
Mara!

541
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,086
Mara!

542
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,456
Mara.

543
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:39,390
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

544
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,461
[gasping]

545
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:45,131
Are you okay?
Where's Joe and Jenna?

546
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:47,232
I think
they're dead.

547
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:49,100
They are?

548
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:53,472
I tried to get them off,
but they won't come out of my clothes.

549
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:56,509
I thought it was you.

550
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:18,698
No.
Dude, the sweat suit?

551
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:21,701
Sorry, I just didn't
have time to think.

552
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:23,703
I'm not wearing this.

553
00:34:27,305 --> 00:34:28,908
Hey, I called Rosetti.

554
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:31,144
Smart.

555
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:43,089
What was it like?

556
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:45,625
It...

557
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,830
It really fucking sucked.

558
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:03,776
[chuckles]

559
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:06,748
What the hell
is this <i>ET</i> bullshit?

560
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,652
Hey. Hey.

561
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,320
Hey, get your fucking hands
off of him!

562
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:16,222
- Hey, get your fucking hands off...
- Hey, don't grab her!

563
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:18,758
- Put her down! Stop!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

564
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:21,329
- Mara!
- Get your fucking hands off of me right now!

565
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:23,130
- Mara!
- I said, get off!

566
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:37,312
Mara, I'm Dr. Rolanda.

567
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:39,647
We're here
to help you, okay?

568
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,751
Help yourself, lady.

569
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:02,871
[indistinct conversation]

570
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:04,439
Okay.

571
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:07,309
This is just going to be monitoring
your vitals. That's all it is.

572
00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:10,713
We're just gonna do
a little bit of blood work.

573
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:13,048
Just making sure that
everything is normalized.

574
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,684
We're gonna get you
out of here in no time.

575
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:19,021
- Okay, okay.
- All right. It's okay, it's okay.

576
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,958
ET.

577
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:31,033
Elliott.

578
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:36,772
ET.

579
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,076
Elliott.

580
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,111
[Mara] ET!

581
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,048
Elliott!

582
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:49,319
ET!

583
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:01,096
Hey, Mara.

584
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,835
Mara. Hey.

585
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:07,971
Yo.

586
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:11,975
Where are we?

587
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:15,145
I don't know.

588
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:17,613
But I think they're
doing tests on us.

589
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:19,716
The whole class is here.

590
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,931
They asked me
a bunch of questions.

591
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:37,734
Like what?

592
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:40,536
Like what I've had to eat and
drink in the past couple months,

593
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:42,606
and the places
I've visited.

594
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:45,975
And my list
of sexual partners.

595
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:48,111
What did you say?

596
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:52,582
I just told them...
your mom.

597
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:55,784
- [both chuckling]
- Nice.

598
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:59,091
- I knew you'd like that one.
- Mm.

599
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,196
Have you ever done it?

600
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,435
Are you gonna ask me?

601
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,239
I don't actually care.

602
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:17,508
You don't?

603
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:19,976
No.

604
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:24,049
Just don't, like, screw anyone
while you're my girlfriend.

605
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,052
Am I your girlfriend?

606
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:30,888
- Are you?
- Am I?

607
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,391
Do you wanna be
my girlfriend?

608
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:42,434
I guess that would be fine.

609
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,173
Cool.

610
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:56,916
What's gonna happen
to us now?

611
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:01,253
I think we just,
you know, date.

612
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,657
No, I meant
in this plastic world.

613
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:06,425
Oh.

614
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:12,932
I think...
this is our life now.

615
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,313
[Mara] <i>So, our beloved government
quarantined us in tents,</i>

616
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:31,651
<i>trying to make pills that would
keep our blood inside our bodies.</i>

617
00:39:31,784 --> 00:39:33,184
<i>It was a blast.</i>

618
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,189
What's your name
for the record, please?

619
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,922
Mara Carlyle.

620
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,326
Cox. Steve Cox.

621
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,727
- Cole.
- Cole what?

622
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,297
Cole wants a lawyer.

623
00:39:45,064 --> 00:39:47,933
- How old are you, Becky?
- Seventeen.

624
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:50,170
- Seventeen.
- I'm 17.

625
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:52,638
Not for long.

626
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,842
[woman] What can you tell
me about Katelyn Ogden?

627
00:39:55,975 --> 00:39:58,645
She's hot. I'd tap it.

628
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:00,980
I was gonna take her
to prom.

629
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:03,183
Tell me about Perry Love.

630
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,451
He was hot.

631
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:06,386
I'd tap that too.

632
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:09,055
- What did you dream about last night?
- Doughnuts.

633
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:10,655
You can ask my lawyer.

634
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,993
- Do you get angry, Becky?
- Yeah, I'm angry all the time.

635
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,763
- Are you angry right now?
- Fuck, yeah.

636
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:19,999
What is it you want
to do in college?

637
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,871
Stay alive.

638
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,143
[Mara] <i>At least
we were comfortable.</i>

639
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,545
Ugh.
So uncomfortable.

640
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,650
Always smells weird
in here.

641
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:39,119
Like feet
and cinnamon buns.

642
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:41,923
Yeah, more feet.

643
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,394
You okay?

644
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,399
What if it happens
to you?

645
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:55,969
- It won't.
- How do you know that?

646
00:40:57,637 --> 00:40:59,340
Promise.

647
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,541
I can't promise you.

648
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,478
No, why?
Just promise me.

649
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,380
Promise or I'll scream.

650
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,621
- [laughs] Stop it.
- Promise. Please.

651
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:15,622
It'll be fine.

652
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:17,892
That's not
very convincing.

653
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:21,663
But if you go, like,
I'm coming.

654
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:24,264
And if I go,
I'm taking you too.

655
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:29,037
I'm serious.
We're being roomies down there.

656
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,872
'Cause we both know
we're not going up there.

657
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:33,141
I'm fucking down.
I love you. Oh, my God.

658
00:41:33,274 --> 00:41:35,343
- I love you too.
- Down to that.

659
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:39,281
[both exclaim quietly]

660
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:44,419
[man shouting
on video game]

661
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:49,724
I am so bored!

662
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,461
I'm so bored!

663
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,628
How long do we have to stay
in this condom?

664
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,096
A while, I think.

665
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,634
At least we know
we're super healthy.

666
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,505
- We should try to break out.
- I already tried that.

667
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,507
[man] Why would we try
and break out?

668
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:06,843
I got here as soon
as I heard about this place.

669
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:08,376
This is where
they're going to cure us.

670
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,346
Those conservative weirdos
with the signs,

671
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,715
they said
that we were cursed.

672
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:16,920
Everyone's online trying to figure
out why it's happening and who's next.

673
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,788
Whose fault
do they think it is?

674
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,922
Bro, it's no one's fault.

675
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,926
But if it's a curse,
it's someone's fault.

676
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:26,096
But, bro, there's no curse.

677
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:28,029
I don't care
why it's happening.

678
00:42:28,163 --> 00:42:29,965
I just want to figure out
how to stop it.

679
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,335
Maybe we just
have to graduate.

680
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:39,275
I'm looking at you right now and
really feel like we should make out.

681
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:41,010
Stop.

682
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,246
- Stop making that face.
- What face?

683
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:53,656
Hey. How are you doing?

684
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,359
Right now?
[chuckles]

685
00:42:56,493 --> 00:43:00,398
No. I mean, like,
with the Daltons and everything.

686
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:04,200
Can we talk
about it later?

687
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:08,539
I just want you to know
you can talk to me.

688
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,906
I'd rather just
make out with you.

689
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,812
- But later, I mean.
- There is no later.

690
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:19,550
That was
fucking deep, son.

691
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:22,553
That's what
your mom said.

692
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,588
Ah! That was great!

693
00:43:28,158 --> 00:43:30,394
<i>We know
these are scary times.</i>

694
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:35,332
<i>But with your help, we are sure a
cure is right around the corner.</i>

695
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,839
Now, we know
this hasn't been ideal,

696
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:44,841
but we're doing everything we can to help
solve this problem as quickly as possible.

697
00:43:44,976 --> 00:43:48,646
We in Washington will continue
to push forward to find a cure,

698
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:53,118
so that you good kids can go back to
the lives that you so richly deserve.

699
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:55,954
Now, does anybody have
any questions?

700
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:57,420
- Yeah.
- Yes.

701
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,456
Firstly, thank you
for talking to us.

702
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,925
- Super cool.
- You're very welcome.

703
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,427
Secondly, how come whenever
someone from Washington

704
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:05,230
says that they're doing
everything to help us,

705
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:09,567
it usually means that nothing is
getting done and we're all screwed?

706
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:15,306
Uh, perhaps my PowerPoint
wasn't clear...

707
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,342
Oh, no. It was clear.
It just sucked.

708
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:20,945
Unless this is a magical
slide show that can cure us,

709
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:24,850
I don't get what you're doing
that can actually help us.

710
00:44:24,983 --> 00:44:27,486
Hey, I get it. I do.

711
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:29,488
You have every reason
to be angry.

712
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:33,993
But I just want all of you to know that
you have all of our thoughts and prayers.

713
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:36,095
[derisive laughter]

714
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:38,063
I don't want that shit
unless it works.

715
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,932
If you can't fix us,
then just tell us.

716
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,802
We have too many assclowns
lying to us as it is.

717
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:44,436
Mara is right.

718
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,171
You politicians don't care
about us.

719
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:49,140
The only people
who care about us is us.

720
00:44:49,274 --> 00:44:52,010

- Quakers! Yeah, baby!

721
00:44:52,144 --> 00:44:54,979
Quakers! Quakers!
Quakers! Quakers!

722
00:44:55,113 --> 00:44:57,649
Quakers! Quakers!
Quakers! Quak...

the Christmas decorations?

I don't think people felt very
festive this year, you know.

Oh, my God!
This is so cool!

742

A real one too.
Not one of those fake ones.

- Room!

747
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:08,577
Are they really gonna call
the pill the Snooze Button?

748
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,947
That's what that Dr. Rolanda
lady said on the news.

749
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,450
Oh, yeah. I know her.
She's pretty professional.

750
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:16,819
For a bitch.

751
00:48:16,952 --> 00:48:19,855
She can call it whatever she
wants as long as it works.

752
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:21,692
True that.

00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:25,796

We know you smoke pot.
You're terrible at hiding it.

758
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:38,908
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

759
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:42,079

the cool dad.

I'm just joking.

Come on.

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,476
Is this what
adulthood is like?

763
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:14,411
Yeah.

764
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:18,516
It's like this, except with more
anxiety and complete terror.

765
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:22,319
We just gotta get you
through graduation.

766
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:27,492
Everyone keeps saying that.
You really think that's the winner?

767
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:31,797
I gotta think something.

768
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,469
Sick tree!

769
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,993
I don't think I've ever been
in a girl's room before.

770
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:04,597
I mean,
one that I've dated.

771
00:50:04,729 --> 00:50:07,699
Well, I guess you can
tick that off your bucket list.

772
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:11,903
Also, I got you a present.

773
00:50:12,037 --> 00:50:15,073
No! I haven't had time
to get you one.

774
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:18,810
What?

775
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:22,482
[chuckles] What is it?

776
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:26,017
It's my body...

777
00:50:27,718 --> 00:50:31,022
in a sexual situation.

778
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:38,530
Oh. [nervous chuckle]

779
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:40,665
Never gotten that
before.

780
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:43,769
- [exclaims]
- Oh, you okay?

781
00:50:49,942 --> 00:50:51,844
Can I tell you something?

782
00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:53,813
Yeah.

783
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,152
I'm just so glad I didn't
explode all over you.

784
00:51:01,587 --> 00:51:03,622
I just kept thinking,
please don't explode.

785
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:05,657
Please don't explode.

786
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:08,828
- You guys have it so tough.
- So tough.

787
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:12,933
I really like you.

788
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:16,603
I really like you too.

789
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,622
Do you think
we're safe now?

790
00:51:37,492 --> 00:51:40,061
I don't know.
I hope so.

791
00:51:40,193 --> 00:51:42,495
I say we just stick to the
plan, go back to school

792
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:44,497
and take it
one day at a time.

793
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:45,899
What?

794
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:49,803
- What to what?
- The school part.

795
00:51:51,338 --> 00:51:53,106
You didn't hear?

796
00:51:53,673 --> 00:51:55,108
No!

797
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:57,245
[Tess] Come on. Go!

798
00:51:57,378 --> 00:51:59,847
Move! Come on!

799
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:02,283
Move!

800
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:06,921
All the other classes are
meeting at the community center

801
00:52:07,053 --> 00:52:08,789
so they don't catch
our disease.

802
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:10,491
Why?

803
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:12,659
It could be worse.

804
00:52:12,792 --> 00:52:15,329
- How?
- We could be like Katelyn.

805
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:18,966
[Spiros] <i>Katelyn wasn't the
first person I saw blow up.</i>

806
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,270
When I was stationed,

807
00:52:22,404 --> 00:52:27,542
I saw a buddy of mine, Mark
Jensen, step on a land mine.

808
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:29,777
No goodbyes,
no last words.

809
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:33,114
Just... that's it.

810
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,318
That was it.

811
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:39,888
I'm not about to sit here and tell
you that everything is gonna be okay,

812
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:42,123
because that's bullshit.

813
00:52:42,257 --> 00:52:43,826
I mean, I don't know.

814
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:48,797
But I do know that
I will help you graduate.

815
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,266
- That sound good?
- [students] Yeah.

816
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,635
Yeah?

You're not gonna abduct us
again, are you?

824
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:35,244
Firstly, I never did that.

825
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,046
Secondly, no.

826
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,748
We're really confident
that the Snooze...

827
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:41,051
Don't say it.

828
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:45,220
Snooze Button.

829
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:47,122
Fuck.

830
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:48,858
What do you have
against it?

831
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,061
- Literally just the name.
- Okay. What would you call it?

832
00:53:52,193 --> 00:53:54,963
I don't know.
Something sciencey.

833
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:57,968
It has a sciencey name
that nobody remembers.

834
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:01,672
Why? 'Cause it's a dozen syllables long.
Hence, the nickname.

835
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:05,007
Thank you so much for FBI-splaining
the concept of nicknames to me.

836
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,044
You're welcome. Now get out of here.
You're healthy.

00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:13,149
Why are you still here?

838
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:16,352
In my office?
'Cause I work here.

839
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:19,321
No, like, if you think
it's all done and cured,

840
00:54:19,455 --> 00:54:20,990
why are you still here?

841
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,759
There are a dozen grunts that
can take my blood pressure.

842
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:24,895
You have a badge.

843
00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:26,996
Everyone here has a badge.

844
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:30,868
You don't think
it's done, do you?

845
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,806
You know what they say.
Hope for the best...

846
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,842
Prepare for the worst!

847
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,877

Is that a sex thing?

848
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:45,217
No. But maybe. Ready?

849
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,454
- Yeah.
- You're good. Just go forward.

850
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:51,890
Am I gonna hurt myself?

851
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:55,360
You probably will,
but it won't be my fault.

852
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,828
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. I'm just scared.

853
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,697
- Why are you scared?
- I don't know.

854
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:01,633
- I'm so trustworthy.
- I'm so nervous.

855
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:03,267
It's okay.

856
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,103
But you need to be careful
'cause this is a dangerous place.

857
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,505
Okay. Wait, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

858
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,141
What am I
getting myself into?

859
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:12,776
Stand right here. Ready?
And now you're gonna twirl.

860
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:16,246
- One, two, three.
- This is fun. I like this.

861
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,083
- Okay.
- Okay.

862
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,451
- Are you ready?
- No.

863
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,188
Okay, I'm ready.

864
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,327
Were you prepared?

865
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,799
No.

866
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:39,104
I was like, what should I get my boy
toy for Valentine's-slash-his birthday?

867
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:44,210
And I thought,
he had it so tough when he was a kid,

868
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:48,747
he would dance by himself
in a barn to '80s music.

869
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:51,384
["And We Danced"
by the Hooters playing]

870
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:58,890
So, maybe he'd like to know
he wasn't by himself anymore.

871
00:56:06,498 --> 00:56:08,433
- This is cool.
- Yeah?

872
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:10,536
Yeah.

873
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:14,272
Thanks, Mara.

874
00:56:16,642 --> 00:56:18,877
[both chuckle]

875
00:56:22,347 --> 00:56:26,385
["And We Danced"

876
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:29,957
[Mara laughs]

877
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,297
[both chattering]

878
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,720
Can we talk
about something?

879
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:01,988
You're pregnant.

880
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:03,823
I am. It's triplets.

881
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:06,460
- [gasps] My seed is mighty!
- It is.

882
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:12,032
- Okay. Go on.
- Uh, okay. Um...

883
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,535
What happens
after we graduate?

884
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:19,240
You mean, like, with us?

885
00:57:19,374 --> 00:57:20,973
Yeah.

886
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:22,642
I actually haven't thought
that far ahead.

887
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,646
- I know it's silly, but...
- I know I want to be with you.

888
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:28,649
Yeah?

889
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:31,751
Yeah. I mean...

890
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:35,723
You're, like, the best thing to come
out of spontaneous combustions for me.

891
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:38,191
- The very best?
- The very best.

892
00:57:38,325 --> 00:57:39,792
- I love you.
- Fuck!

893
00:57:39,926 --> 00:57:41,261
[gasps]

894
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:42,996
- You can't say that!
- I'm so sorry!

895
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:44,999
You can't say that!

896
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:47,167
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry. I screwed that up.

897
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,236
- Yeah, you did!
- Oh, my God!

898
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,772
- Say it to me later on, okay?
- No.

899
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:54,775
Okay. Yeah, I'll say it.
[chuckles]

900
00:57:54,908 --> 00:57:56,911
[laughs]

["And We Danced"

902
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:03,319
Hey. Um...

903
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:09,223
Maybe this summer,
we can just drive around for a while.

904
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:11,659
I'd like that.

905
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:15,396
If we're not
fleshy dead bits.

906
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,632
If we're not
fleshy dead bits.

907

[song continues, ends]

908
00:58:29,811 --> 00:58:32,913
- [pop ballad plays]
- Have you heard of the infinite monkey theorem?

909
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:36,116
No, but I'm way into
how that sounds.

910
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:40,153
It's the idea of, like,
if you have infinite monkeys

911
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:42,389
and you give them
all infinite typewriters

912
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:46,162
and an infinite amount of time,
they'll write Shakespeare.

913
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:48,363
The word "Shakespeare"?

914
00:58:48,497 --> 00:58:50,300
No, like,
a full play of his.

915
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:52,033
Sound like pretentious
fucking monkeys.

916
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:54,736
- Stop.
- Can't they write something else?

917
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:58,240
They'll literally write every book
ever written, because they can't not.

918
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:01,010
- They can't... not.
- Mm-hmm.

919
00:59:01,144 --> 00:59:02,979
I think about this
a lot.

920
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:04,914
Okay.

921
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:07,550
I think it helps explain
what's happening.

922
00:59:07,684 --> 00:59:10,887
You think monkeys are writing
books that make us explode?

923
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:13,922
No, the idea that because
you can't say with certainty

924
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:15,457
that something
won't happen,

925
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:18,493
then eventually it has to
happen, like the Big Bang.

926
00:59:19,662 --> 00:59:22,698
I like my idea about evil
monkeys writing plays better.

927
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:28,771
This is taking forever,
isn't it?

928
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:33,410
I don't think
she's coming.

929
00:59:35,545 --> 00:59:37,782
No one's ever been
scared of me before.

930
00:59:38,815 --> 00:59:40,049
Let's go somewhere else.

931
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:42,351
No. This is where we go.

932
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:44,520
This is our spot.
This is our thing.

933
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:49,426
I know. But maybe
it's not our thing anymore.

934
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:59,170
Whatever.

935
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:08,677
The last thing I want is for you
to feel like science fair projects.

936
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:11,549
Because of your help,
the CDC and the FDA

937
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:13,984
have been working around
the clock with Washington

938
01:00:14,118 --> 01:00:19,322
to make the Snooze Button available
over the counter to all Americans.

939
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:22,694
So, what is
the Snooze Button?

940
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:28,233
For starters, it's not,
sadly, a cure, but it is...

941
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:31,268
a treatment.

942
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:34,072
Give you an example.

943
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:35,673
Sometimes you're typing
on your computer

944
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:39,578
and, out of nowhere,
it turns off, crashes.

945
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:43,881
When that happens to us,
we're not so lucky.

946
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:48,553
- Can I get a volunteer?
- [man] Yeah.

947
01:00:49,419 --> 01:00:50,854
[Dr. Rolanda] Steve, great.
Come on up.

948
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:53,258
[students cheer]

949
01:00:55,258 --> 01:00:57,594
Okay. Yes.

950
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,465
- This is for our bros.
- [students] Yeah!

951
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:02,366
- [students cheer, whistle]
- Okay. Steve.

952
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:05,335
- Can I get you to pat your head, please?
- That's it?

953
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:07,171
Can you rub your belly?

954
01:01:07,303 --> 01:01:09,674
[Steve] Yeah, come on.

955
01:01:09,808 --> 01:01:11,477
Okay, stand on one foot.

956
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:14,179
Jump up and down.

957
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,049
This is bullshit.

[gasping]

959
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:25,891

Come on.

- [screaming continues]

967
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,654
Come on.

[screaming, clamoring]

973
01:02:31,191 --> 01:02:33,426
[Dylan] Mara! Mara!

974
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:36,396
Come on.
This way is faster.

975
01:02:36,528 --> 01:02:38,764
- What the fuck is happening?
- They were wrong. They were...

976
01:02:38,898 --> 01:02:40,800
[groans]

977
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:42,769
We need you...

978
01:02:43,903 --> 01:02:45,773
[gasping]

979
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:09,763
[gasping continues]

980
01:03:16,236 --> 01:03:17,872
[Dylan] Mara!

981
01:03:19,105 --> 01:03:23,377
[whimpering, crying]

982
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:30,817
Are you okay?

983
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:33,255
No. Are you?

984
01:03:33,387 --> 01:03:35,857
I'm just glad
you're still here.

985
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:23,906
[no audible dialogue]

986
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,610
[Mara] <i>A fragment of his
jawbone hit my forehead.</i>

01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:35,585
Mara! Mara!

989
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,856
<i>I never felt anything.</i>

990
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,892
Okay.

991
01:04:43,026 --> 01:04:44,728
Oh, my God.

992
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:47,564
Hey.

993
01:05:13,391 --> 01:05:15,893
<i>All I remember
is wanting to die.</i>

994
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:52,663
Honey?

995
01:05:54,264 --> 01:05:57,068
Um, Dylan's mom called
for you.

996
01:05:58,736 --> 01:06:01,173
She just wanted to see
how you were doing.

997
01:06:45,683 --> 01:06:47,586
[Tess] Mara,
can you open the door?

998
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,023
Please.

999
01:06:53,692 --> 01:06:56,695
Mara, I just want to
make sure that you're okay.

1000
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:03,201
[laughing, exclaiming on video]

1001
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:10,141
[Dylan] <i>Oh, my God.</i>

1002
01:07:14,746 --> 01:07:17,650
All right,
you're gonna need vodka,

1003
01:07:18,282 --> 01:07:19,618
dry vermouth,

1004
01:07:19,752 --> 01:07:21,485
grenadine and ice.

1005
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:24,589
Mix three parts vodka...

1006
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:30,962
with one part vermouth.

1007
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,903
Fill with ice...

1008
01:07:36,769 --> 01:07:38,304
and stir...

1009
01:07:40,573 --> 01:07:43,943
before pouring
into a martini glass.

1010
01:07:45,178 --> 01:07:47,747
Okay. And then,
with the grenadine,

1011
01:07:47,881 --> 01:07:52,653
you're gonna basically pour the entire
fucking bottle into the martini.

1012
01:07:54,421 --> 01:07:58,024
And now you have my brand-new
cocktail, which I've called,

1013
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,160
"All of My Friends
and Boyfriend Are Dead."

1014
01:08:05,564 --> 01:08:07,099
[sighs]

1015
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,669
Well, I have a couple
of questions.

1016
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:13,373
Oh. Okay, but hold on.

1017
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,675
No, please don't.

1018
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:23,984
- You can have the next one.
- Okay.

1019
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,522
- I'm not equipped to deal with this.
- I know, right?

1020
01:08:27,654 --> 01:08:31,893
But I've literally found one thing
that makes that feeling go away.

1021
01:08:33,327 --> 01:08:34,862
What is it?

1022
01:08:35,563 --> 01:08:37,832
[whispers] Alcohol.

1023
01:08:37,965 --> 01:08:39,199
Shh.

1024
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:42,769
- Why are you whispering?
- 'Cause it's a secret.

1025
01:08:43,437 --> 01:08:45,806
'Cause I'm underage.

1026
01:08:46,607 --> 01:08:48,376
Don't tell anyone, though.

1027
01:09:16,304 --> 01:09:18,740
[humming drunkenly]

1028
01:09:24,645 --> 01:09:27,181
[gasps] Tessy!

1029

Mara.

1030
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:32,186
Tessy!
Let's go fuck shit up.

1031
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,956
- How did you get here?
- I walked, yo.

1032
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,958
- That's, like, ten miles.
- I know.

1033
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:38,992
I'm fucking Wonder Woman.

1034
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:41,296
Come on.
Let's go do something.

1035
01:09:43,163 --> 01:09:45,966
Let's go throw water balloons
full of red paint at kids.

1036
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,001
Mara.

1037
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,304
No.
We have to go to school.

1038
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:50,604
Oh! Fuck school!

1039
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:52,574
No! I can't fuck school!

It really fucking sucks. And I'm sorry.

1042

for seven fucking months.

1043

I don't want to die.

Well...

1045
01:10:09,258 --> 01:10:10,427
then don't die.

1046
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:12,428

- No.

you actually stop existing.

in Florida with the sinkhole?

and a sinkhole opened.

right down into it.

His brother heard him
shouting from the next room.

1199
01:26:54,483 --> 01:26:59,956
He ran over and found this giant
pit where the room used to be.

1200
01:27:00,856 --> 01:27:03,626
He could hear his brother
screaming for help,

1201
01:27:03,759 --> 01:27:06,895

to help him.

1202

his body out.

he didn't deserve it.

deserve this.

got nothing to do with it.

That's a good line.

1211
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:41,464
I stole it
from Clint Eastwood.

1212
01:27:41,597 --> 01:27:42,966
Oh.

1213
01:27:49,506 --> 01:27:51,408
I think Dylan got it.

1214
01:27:53,709 --> 01:27:55,945
The answer, I mean.

1215
01:28:02,452 --> 01:28:03,887
God.

1216
01:28:04,921 --> 01:28:07,158
What am I supposed
to do now?

1217
01:28:11,294 --> 01:28:14,064
Do you want to come over
for dinner next week?

1218
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:18,837
Yeah, sure.

1219
01:28:20,304 --> 01:28:21,572
Thanks.

1220
01:28:28,913 --> 01:28:30,982
Are you okay?

1221
01:29:37,448 --> 01:29:38,917
I'm sorry.

[Mara] <i>Everyone left,

1228
01:31:06,774 --> 01:31:09,544
<i>It was super anticlimactic.</i>

1229
01:31:11,544 --> 01:31:14,347
<i>The man was like,
"Hey, the Snooze Button works.</i>

1230
01:31:14,481 --> 01:31:16,283
<i>We just got
that last batch wrong.</i>

1231
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,886

this new batch is legit."</i>

1234
01:31:47,347 --> 01:31:49,150
You sure
this thing is safe?

1235
01:31:49,284 --> 01:31:50,985
I mean, compared to what?

[song continues playing]

1237
01:32:07,636 --> 01:32:10,571
Call us every hour.
Or even more often.

1238
01:32:10,704 --> 01:32:12,039
Yeah. Call us a lot.

1239
01:32:12,173 --> 01:32:14,643
You know,
I actually think I will.

school, which makes sense.</i>

<i>They're also going to make a memorial
for the departed, which makes less sense,</i>

1244
01:32:52,714 --> 01:32:54,683
<i>because,
let's be honest...</i>

1245
01:32:56,585 --> 01:32:59,122
<i>that sappy shit's
gonna suck.</i>

1246

<i>By the end

[pounding]

1252
01:33:29,452 --> 01:33:32,323
<i>So, what did we learn?</i>

1253
01:33:33,288 --> 01:33:35,392

it's all a...</i>

<i>Fuck this shit, man.</i>

1256
01:33:42,198 --> 01:33:45,469
<i>The world is a fucking cruel piece
of shit and nothing makes sense,</i>

1257
01:33:45,602 --> 01:33:48,304
<i>and the only thing you can do
is put your middle fingers up</i>

1258
01:33:48,438 --> 01:33:50,607
<i>and be all, like,
fuck you, life!</i>

1259

I'm gonna get my bachelors of bullshit,</i>

<i>I'm gonna write some books</i>

1263
01:34:00,118 --> 01:34:03,521

but do really well online.</i>

1264
01:34:03,654 --> 01:34:05,456
<i>I'll probably date
some nice boys.</i>

1265
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:06,958
<i>I'll probably marry
a few of them.</i>

1266
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:10,494
<i>And sometimes, late at night
when the world is quiet...</i>

1267
01:34:11,194 --> 01:34:13,363
<i>I'll tell them about Dylan</i>

1268
01:34:13,497 --> 01:34:15,466
<i>and what he meant to me,</i>

1269
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,803

every day.</i>

1270

I'm gonna be president.</i>

And I'll tell him...</i>

1275
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:34,851
That's President Bitch
to you, motherfucker.

1276

<i>The Big Bang happened out of
nowhere, for no reason.</i>

1277
01:34:38,788 --> 01:34:42,158
<i>Or maybe God set it all
into motion. Who knows?</i>

1278
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:44,564
<i>But then, like,
the dinosaurs died</i>

Fuck, man.

1281
01:34:52,137 --> 01:34:54,673
<i>And volcanoes erupt,
and drunk drivers drive,</i>

1282
01:34:54,806 --> 01:34:59,944
<i>and sinkholes collapse,
and sometimes people explode.</i>

1283
01:35:00,078 --> 01:35:03,249
<i>And I guess that just means
bad shit's gonna happen.</i>

1284
01:35:03,382 --> 01:35:05,250
<i>It's inevitable.</i>

1285
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:06,817
<i>And so, here we are.</i>

1286
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,553
<i>I'm gonna live the life
I want to have right now.</i>

1287
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:13,391
<i>I'm not gonna waste time waiting for
a day that may never come for me.</i>

1288
01:35:13,924 --> 01:35:14,860
<i>So fuck it.</i>

1289
01:35:14,994 --> 01:35:16,528
<i>I'm gonna stay
at the beach house</i>

1290
01:35:16,662 --> 01:35:19,064
<i>and smoke a hookah
with my toes in the sand.</i>

1291

<i>I don't know what's gonna happen next.
I hope it's cool.</i>

I could die any second now.</i>

01:35:25,204 --> 01:35:26,772
<i>Hell, so could you.</i>

1294
01:35:26,905 --> 01:35:30,109
<i>Nothing's fair,
but it's a beautiful world,</i>

1295
01:35:30,243 --> 01:35:32,844
<i>and I'm happy
I get to be here.</i>

1296
01:35:33,713 --> 01:35:35,682
<i>If only
for a little while.</i>
