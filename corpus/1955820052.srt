"In fond memory of Dulcinea,

11
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,563
beloved member of our community."

12
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,525
"Rest in peace, Toby. We will miss you."

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,320
[sobbing] I'll miss me too.

14
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,404
Hmm.

15
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,282
There is something very wrong here.

16
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,785
I'll say.
Look at this guy and his dumb beard.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,622
[chuckles]
And what kind of crazy name is Artephius?

18
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,791
No, I mean my headstone.

19
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,751
"Puss in Boots, great guy.

20
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,628
Did some neat stuff."

21
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,254
"Did some neat stuff"?

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,758
This is no sufficient epitaph
for a hero such as myself.

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,552
[giggles]
Actually, it says "Pus in Boots."

24
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,762
What?

25
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,223
Ugh. A disgusting word.

26
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,517
This must be corrected posthaste!

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,519
Don't you think
we should be more concerned

28
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,896
with the fact that we have graves?

29
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,732
Yes, this is also troubling.

30
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,150
Is it not, Babieca?

31
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,235
[chuffs]

32
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,737
Although he cannot make words anymore,
he agrees.

33
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,573
Wait, if we have graves,

34
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,035
maybe we're g-g-g-ghosts!

35
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,122
[screams]

36
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,834
Do not be ridiculous, Toby.

37
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,212
I have never been a ghost before,
and I am not going to start now.

38
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,340
Maybe we should see if someone
can explain what happened.

39
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,883
An excellent suggestion.

40
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
We go!

00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,939
[wind whistling]

42
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,490
I know it's early,

43
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,326
but doesn't the town seem kind of...
empty?

44
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,954
Mm-hmm. Something is amiss.

45
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,832
Look at how my whiskers
are sticking straight out.

46
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,167
That is a sign of danger.

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,548

You're all alive!

-[neighs]
-Oh!

52
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,641
Is it weird that she hugged
the horse first?

53
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,935
[both] Ooh! [grunting softly]

54
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,563
-Oh!
-[grunts]

55
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,606
Aah!

56
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,817
When you didn't come back,
we assumed you'd died.

57
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,235
We had funerals.

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,070
[chuckles] I played the bagpipes.

59
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,823
Nuh-uh, we weren't dead.
We were in the Netherworld,

60
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,825
where we joined up with a wizard
and the Zephelim

61
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,494
to defeat the Blind King,
who turned out to be Evil Puss,

62
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,955
so that the Tiny Queen
could rule once more!

63
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,335
Mm-hmm, but did you hear what I just said?
I played the bagpipes.

64
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,254
Hmph.
I feel like you should be more impressed.

65
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,423
But why did you have funerals?

66
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,342
We have only been gone a day or so.

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,843
Are you mad?

68
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,137
You've been gone just over a year now.

69
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,598
-[all scream and gasp]
-Wait.

70
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,018
Didn't someone say time worked different
in the Netherworld?

71
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,144
No.

72
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,729
Why, does it?

73
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,774
Yeah. It was that Artephius guy.

74
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,818
Or he would have said it
if he hadn't been slacking off.

75
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,861
Shirker.

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,155
Pajuna, where is everybody?

77
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,199
You don't know?

78
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,742
They're all gone.

79
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,911
-Where?
-I don't know.

80
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,829
Scattered to the wind, I imagine.

81
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,831
And you'd better go too.

82
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,792
Go on. Scoot! Shoo!

83
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,835
They won't like you being here.

84
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,963
-Who won't?
-[Raul] Us!

85
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,547
Us won't.

86
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,299
Ha!

87
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,218
A few thieves? [chuckles]

88
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,761
This is not a problem.

89
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,555
No, Puss. Hundreds of thieves.

90
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,183
San Lorenzo is a thief town now!

91
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,061
Never!
I will now demonstrate to them

92
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,523
that this is still very much
a cat-human-pig-goblin-cow town.

93
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,149
Also, skeletons.

94
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,194
-[groans]
-Pablo, remember me?

95
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,197
The name is Raul, and, no, I do not.

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,991
[gasps] You have forgotten me?

97
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,243
Then let me jog your memory.

98
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,160
Oy!

99
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,246
[all grunting and exclaiming]

100
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,289
Ha-ha!

101
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,752
[all grunting and exclaiming]

102
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,547
Ha!

103
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,508
[Raul] Oh, right.

104
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,218
Now I remember. [groans]

105
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,928
Puss in Boots. [groans] Right?

106
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,763
Puss in Boots?

107
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,308
The former protector of San Lorenzo?

108
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,351
They say he did some neat stuff.

109
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,772
Fiends, allow me to show you
what sort of neat stuff I did.

110
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,274
[grunts]

111
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,608
[all exclaiming]

112
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,777
-[thief crying]
-Hyah!

113
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,492
[thieves shouting]

114
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,287
[grunting]

115
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,373
[laughter]

116
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,708
[Puss panting]

117
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,835
Fine. You have won the first round.

118
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,546
Apparently I'm fatigued
by all the inter-wordly travel.

119
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,841
How about you let me go
and we just say best two out of three?

120
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,844
Um, we have to ask the boss.

121
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,472
Um, I am sorry. The boss?

122
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,601
[laughter]

123
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,188
[groans] This guy?

124
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,440
Well, well, well.

125
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,691
Puss in the Boots.

126
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,818
I thought you were dead.

127
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,446
And I do hate to be wrong.

128
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,032
You think you can just steal San Lorenzo?

129
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,826
I already have, Puss in the Boots.

130
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,496
And it's not San Lorenzo anymore.

131
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,666
It's The Fortress of El Moco.

132
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,835
What? It is not a fortress.

133
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,923
No, but it will be
after I blow up the town

134
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,300
and build a fortress in its place!

135
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm getting one last shipment
of explosives tomorrow,

136
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,055
and that should be enough.

137
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,475
Then, boom, no more town!

138
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,811
This I will not allow.

139
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,354
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

140
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,022
Really, very, really.

141
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,650
I am the sworn protector of San Lorenzo,

142
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,985
and that means that I must get rid of you

143
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,196
and bring back the San Lorenzans.

144
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,157
You're going to find that very difficult

145
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,119
-when you have no arms or legs!
-[chuffs]

146
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,954
I enjoy a challenge.

00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,163

[El Moco grunts]

151
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,919
[Dulcinea] Whoo!

152
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,171
Ha! Toby! Artephius!

153
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,548
[both panting]

154
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,590
-Yah!
-Yah!

155
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,092
[Toby panting]

156
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,261
[Puss] I will make San Lorenzo
as it once was!

157
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,178
[grumbles]

158
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,223
So swears Puss in Boots!

159
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,727
[wind whistling]

160
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,730
[somber music]

161
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,903
I cannot believe I left San Lorenzo
unguarded for a year.

162
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,739
And now it is on the verge
of being destroyed.

163
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,992
I have failed everyone.

164
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,202
Don't be silly, Puss.

165
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,079
You haven't failed anyone.

166
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,874
You saved the Netherworld,
and you blocked the portal.

167
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,209
That's some neat stuff.

168
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,295
-[grumbles]
-Sorry, too soon.

169
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,546
I could have protected them.

170
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,340
I should have protected them.
And I still can!

171
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,635
I will find every single child,
woman, skeleton,

172
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,389
man, horse, goblin,
and, uh, whatever Kid Pickles is.

173
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
He's human.

174
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,850
Agree to disagree.

175
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,894
I will find them all,
bring them back here,

176
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,438
and we will get rid of the thieves,
together!

177
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,649
Then everything will be just exactly
the way it was.

178
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,319
But...
what if they don't want to come back?

179
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,862
It's been a year.

180
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,572
They might be happy where they are.

181
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,407
They cannot be happy where they are.

182
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,826
They can only be happy in San Lorenzo.

183
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,204
Because that is where... eh...

184
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,581
that is where they belong.

185
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,378
Maybe you think they can only be happy
in San Lorenzo

186
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,506
because that's where you were happy.

187
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,257
What? Nonsense.

188
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,844
I am a loner, a nomad, a free spirit!

189
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,638
Uh-huh. You say that a lot.

190
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,057
I will save San Lorenzo
from being destroyed

191
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,100
and make it as it once was.

192
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,436
But how are we going to find everyone?

193
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,773
Hey! Maybe we can use this to find 'em.

194
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,776
[gasps] The dowsing rod.
Where did you get it?

195
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,944
My robe.

196
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,196
Uh, but I thought it was broken.

197
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,156
Yeah, I fixed it a while back.

198
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,617
[shouts]

199
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,077
[exhales weakly]

200
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,749
Hey, rod, we're looking
for the lost San Lorenzans.

201
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,584
Where's the nearest one?

202
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,421
[rod warbling]

203
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,550
[gasps]

204
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,009
Someone is still there!

205
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,177
Give me that!

206
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,554
Hear me, rod!

207
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,391
Where is the nearest one
who is not Pajuna?

208
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,309
[rod warbling]

209
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,979
[gasps] Someone is still there!

210
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,940
Duh. Artephius just said that.

211
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,860
[Artephius groans]

212
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,861
Oh!

213
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,948
[rod warbling]

214
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,994
Of course.

215
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,914
Someone has taken refuge
in the Mole Kingdom.

216
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,085
I wonder who could be down here.

217
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,922
The mayor? Kid Pickles?
He may be part mole. It is hard to say.

218
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,010
-[indistinct chatter]
-[maniacal laughter echoes]

219
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,052
[rod clatters]

220
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,310
[blowing raspberries and humming]

221
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,029
Ah, Eames, you're, like,
the funnest guy ever.

222
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,739
[laughs] Why, thank you, Sire.

223
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,909
And if I do say so, you're the handsomest
mole king I've ever known.

224
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,369
Oh, my gosh!

225
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm the handsomest mole king
I've ever known too!

226
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,749
What are the odds?

227
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,417
-Oh!
-This guy really gets me.

228
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,003
[groans] Eames.

229
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,880
You know, as I think about it,

230
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,134
do we really need to bring Eames
back to town with us?

231
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,261
Let us not disturb him. We go. Hurry!

232
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,141
[laughter continues]

233
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,562
[blowing raspberries]

234
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,731
Oh! Oh!

235
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,317
Eames! Surprise!

236
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,528
[laughs] Dulcinea? Puss!

237
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,907
Whoa!
I thought you guys were dead or some junk.

238
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,617
I even came to the funeral.

239
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,620
That cow played some kind
of hilarious flute bag.

240
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,663
-Oh!
-It was insane.

241
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:08,459
It was like... [moaning]

242
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,585
It was weird.

243
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,088
Well, what happened was,
we went to the Netherworld and--

244
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,255
Ah, bup-bup-bup.

245
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,257
Not into long stories, kid.

246
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,801
But wait. Hold up.

247
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,261
You guys sure you're not dead? Let me see.

248
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,641
-[grunts]
-Stop that.

249
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,268
Please stop. I am alive.

250
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,187
Can you not see that I am alive?

251
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,815
You must stop. This is humiliating.

252
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:31,982
I am not dead.

253
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,317
-I want to get poked!
-[gasps]

254
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,527
Whee!

255
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,947
[grunting and laughing] It tickles.

256
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,949
Stop it. Stop it. [laughs]

257
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,243
Uh, what do you think, Royal Adviser?

258
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,455
Your Majesty, it is my official opinion
that they are not dead

259
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,082
and we should have fudge.

260
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,668
Fudge! Great job, Royal Adviser.

261
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,420
Fudge for everyone!

262
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,338
[all exclaim, giggling]

263
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,382
[gasps] Oh!

264
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,259
Ah!

265
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,260
[Toby] Yay!

266
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,636
[all chomping]

267
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,055
[groaning]

268
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,558
[panting]

269
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,476
Royal adviser?

270
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,562
Wow, Eames, that's wonderful.

271
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,021
I know. Isn't it?

272
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,109
Accidentally falling into the Mole Kingdom
was the best decision I ever made.

273
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,653
Oh, I'm so happy in my new life.

274
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,654
What?

275
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,283
Everyone in San Lorenzo ignored me
and treated me like garbage.

276
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,909
And you were the worst!

277
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,287
Me? What did I do?

278
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,206
[shouting] Ow! Trout! Ow! Ow!

279
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,375
A gesture of affection, my friend.

280
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,794
Now come back up to San Lorenzo
with me at once!

281
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,172
-No way!
-[groaning]

282
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,090
You're mean, Puss in Boots!

283
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,135
I'm not going back, not unless you...

284
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,722
not unless you admit I'm your best friend.

285
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,599
What? Never!

286
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,393
I would sooner admit that Attila the Hun
is my best friend,

287
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,061
and he and I barely know each other.

288
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,647
We have hung out, like, what,
one, two, three times, tops.

289
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,608
You are dead to me, Eames.

290
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,235
I will never speak to you again!

291
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,695
Fine by me!

292
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,113
Sorry, Eames.

293
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,448
Sorry.

294
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,411
[all moaning and chomping]

295
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,332
Ah, don't let him get to you, champ.

296
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,584
You want some fudge?

297
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,710
No!

298
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,131
You want some fudge?

299
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,050
Maybe.

300
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,427
-Ha! I knew you did.
-[barking]

301
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,887
[panting]

302
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,056
-Who's my royal adviser?
-I am.

303
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,807
-Who's my royal...
-It's me. It's me.

304
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,145
[Puss] Huh, can you believe that guy?
The nerve.

305
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,606
Eames, best friend. Ha!

306
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,982
Look!

307
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,819
[Cleevil] Grow! Grow! Grow!

308
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,071
I need some cooperation here!

309
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,365
Grow! Grow! Grow!

310
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,535
Grow! Grow! I'm done being--

311
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,827
[Señora Zapata] Cleevil!

312
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,621
What is with the yelling?

313
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,123
Talking to your plants
makes 'em grow faster,

314
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,711
so I figured yelling at your plants
would make 'em grow even faster.

315
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,630
Come on, you stupid plants!

316
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,382
I believe in you!

317
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,426
-Cleevil!
-[screaming] Ghost!

318
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,844
[Puss groans]

319
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,515
Ha. Pretty solid for a ghost.

320
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:13,018
That is because I am not... dead.

321
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,813
[Toby] Yay! [giggling]

322
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,190
[all exclaim softly]

323
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,610
[laughter]

324
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,153
[Cleevil] Oh, yeah!

325
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,364
Did you know that you are not dead?

326
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,032
[Toby giggles]

327
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,701
Oh! Puss in the Boots!

328
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,120
I thought I would never see you again.

329
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,955
And I...

330
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,164
[Puss] Hmm?

331
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,586
...had no strong feelings about that
because I dislike you.

332
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,170
So I see.

333
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,381
What happened to you guys, anyhow?

334
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,425
Well, we went to the Netherworld and--

335
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,803
Okay, I was looking for, like, a one,
maybe two-word answer.

336
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,972
My friends... [grunts]

337
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,099
...I have sworn to return you
to your home,

338
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,268
making all as it once was.

339
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,103
To San Lorenzo!

340
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,898
[all cheer]

341
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,150
[Wimblegurp grunting]

342
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,527
Did I stutter? It is time to go.

343
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,821
San Lorenzo will be destroyed tomorrow

344
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,449
if we do not return at once
and fight off the thieves.

345
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,160
We cannot go, Puss in the Boots.

346
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,037
What? Why not?

347
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,831
Well, you see...

348
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,834
when the thieves took over San Lorenzo,

349
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,711
we were forced to flee.

350
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,130
[Cleevil]  For days,
we ran through the woods,

351
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,965
tired and hungry.

352
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,010
[Kid Pickles]  Then we got here,
and we found a bunch of vegetables,

353
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,428
and we ate 'em all.

354
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,556
I do not understand.

355
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,099
So you ate some vegetables.

356
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,018
Why does that mean you cannot leave?

357
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,728
[Fonvil] Because...

358
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,688
they ate all the vegetables,

359
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,609
and they're gonna stay here
until they grow enough to replace 'em!

360
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,487
Ha!
So you are holding my friends prisoner.

361
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,990
What? No. They're just doing what's right.

362
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,451
They felt bad about eating all our crops,

363
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,162
so they promised to stay
and help us grow more.

364
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,497
It's only fair.

365
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,375
Yes, Puss. It is called common decency.

366
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,752
Maybe you should try it sometime.

367
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,545
[scoffs] Would you--

368
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,756
What is it with you and that sword, man?

369
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,842
You point it at people all the time,
like point, point,

370
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,387
pointy-point, point-point-point,
point, point.

371
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,806
I am insecure about my height.

372
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,308
The vegetables
are the goblins' livelihood.

373
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,852
We cannot leave until they are replaced.

374
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,022
And did you know that vegetables
take a long time to grow?

375
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,984
Hey, look!
I think a new cucumber is coming in.

376
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,527
Grow!

377
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,406
Oh, false alarm. It's a caterpillar.

378
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,867
And it ate all the cucumbers.

379
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,374
It's weird. Goblins are supposed
to be good at farming.

380
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,543
Why do I stink at this?

381
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,795
[grunts]

382
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,547
Goblins, hear me now!

383
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,841
It is vegetables you desire, yes?

384
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,551
[Fonvil] Uh, yes?

385
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,388
So if I can provide you with vegetables,
my friends can go?

386
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,473
Hmm, that seems all right.

387
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,685
Then I will find you the vegetables
you desire.

388
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,771
Ha! Onward to vegetables!

389
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,356
And glory! Ooh!

390
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,733
-[thud]
-[gasps]

391
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,736
I'm gonna stay here, if that's okay.

392
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,238
[giggles] I think Wimblegurp missed me.

393
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,406
That will be fine.

394
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,576
We will return shortly
with the vegetables, and glory!

395
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,538
Hey, before you go,
I wanted to ask you about Cleevil.

396
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,582
Uh, what is she?

397
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,958
I beg your pardon?

398
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,796
I mean, she keeps saying she's a goblin,
but she's got a neck, man.

399
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,632
Goblins don't have necks.
Look at her and look at me.

400
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,800
Neck. No neck.

401
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,926
Neck. No neck.

402
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,303
Neck. No neck.

403
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,763
It's freaking me out.

404
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,182
Is she-- Is she a troll?

405
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,476
No, they-- they have the big hair.

406
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,144
We will return

407
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,023
with the greatest array of vegetables
you have ever seen!

408
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,524
Neck.

409
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,029
[crickets chirping]

410
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,989
Huzzah! Jackpot.

411
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,991
Come, let us raid the radishes

412
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,118
and root through the rutabagas!

413
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,578
-[man] Don't touch them!
-[gasps]

414
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,249
[both scream] Ghosts!

415
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,002
[Puss] Wait! We are not ghosts.

416
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,754
See, we went to the Netherworld, and we--

417
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,631
Yeah, yeah, fun story.

418
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,591
We've been living out in the woods.

419
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,468
Just out in the open?

420
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,346
-Uh-huh, getting back to basics.
-[nervous chuckle]

421
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,724
It's been wonderful, just great.
Marvelous.

422
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,227
We love the bears!

423
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,478
We sure do!

424
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,437
Bears?

425
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,106
Yep, yeah, they're the greatest.

426
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,526
And those are their vegetables,
so you'd better not touch 'em.

427
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,031
Have you two been... living with bears?

428
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,700
Yes! And it's great!

429
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,160
So great!

430
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,163
We aren't living
in constant terror at all!

431
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,790
Nope, not at all!

432
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,543
And they protect us from the wolves!

433
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,753
[laughs] Mostly.

434
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,840
[laughter]

435
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,552
-I'm scared. It's a fun job.
-[laughter]

436
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,262
-[laughing]
-What the--

437
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,931
[snoring]

438
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,767
Well, you need fear no bears or wolves,

439
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,562
because I am here to bring you
back to San Lorenzo.

440
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,771
We must be there by tomorrow

441
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,315
to fight off the thieves
before they destroy the town.

442
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,900
-We leave at once!
-[bear growling]

443
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,696
Oh, I don't think the bears
like that plan. [chuckles]

444
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,030
Huh?

445
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,992
Ooh. [whimpering]

446
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,535
-[growling]
-[gasps]

447
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:27,082
At this point, it's important to move
very slowly and carefully.

448
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,751
[woman] We learned that the hard way.

449
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,087
[whimpers] Do you think

450
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,799
there is anything that would
convince the bears

451
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,342
to let you leave?

452
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,888
Yep. They sure do love honey.

453
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,682
And they haven't had any in a while,

454
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,268
which is why they're so antsy.

455
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:52,608
Well, bears, we will bring you some honey

456
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,028
to exchange for our friends

457
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,156
and all of your vegetables.

458
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,866
But to do that,

459
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:06,705
we will have to leave very slowly

460
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,665
and carefully.

461
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,542
Night terrors!

462
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,628
Oh, no, the terrors of night!

463
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,004
-[roars]
-Whoa!

464
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,008
[grunts] Whoa!

465
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,386
[groaning and panting]

466
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,474
[Dulcinea] Oh! Oh! [whimpering]

467
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,683
Dulcinea!

468
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,479
[grunts] No, chase me!

469
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
Over here!

470
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,024
[panting, grunts]

471
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,861
Ha-ha!
Fortunately, bears cannot climb trees.

472
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,863
[bears growl and roar]

473
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,367
Ah! Bears can climb trees.

474
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,327
[grunting] Ah!

475
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,037
[grunts] You will have your honey.

476
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,497
This I swear!

477
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,624
-[roars]
-Ah!

478
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,834
[suspenseful music]

479
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,504
[roars]

480
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,674
We will return with everyone by tomorrow

481
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
before the fiendish thieves
blow up the town.

482
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,762
We will, for the people of San Lorenzo!

483
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,348
And... maybe a little for you?

484
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,560
No! I have sworn to protect them,
and they need me.

485
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,650
They need me...
in a way I have never been needed before.

486
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,443
Whatever you say, Bootsy.

487
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,821
Rod, bring us to bees!

488
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,156
What? No, no, no, no, no. This is madness.

489
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,157
[both grunt]

490
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,994
We're looking for honey, aren't we?

491
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,163
Oh, you want me to ask it
to bring the bees to us?

492
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,165
Ah, even worse.

493
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,711
The thing is, you see, I dislike bees.

494
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,796
You mean you're afraid of bees.

495
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,256
I...

496
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,674
dislike them.

497
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,676
But you need bees to get honey.

498
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,554
Ha! That is what the bees
want you to believe.

499
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,264
Bees are manipulative creatures,

500
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,767
what with the lying and the tricking
and the stinging me for no good reason.

501
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,769
There must be some other way
to get the honey.

502
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,105
Like, what if we make it ourselves?

503
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,524
If bees make honey,
they must use a recipe,

504
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,109
so we must find this recipe.

505
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,362
Now, where does one find recipes?
In books!

506
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,448
And who has more books
than anyone we know?

507
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,991
Tranche the Ogre!

508
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,617
Puss, we are not going to--

509
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,037
Ooh, Miguela will be there!

510
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,832
I can find out why she never answered
any of my 600 letters.

511
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,876
I have a theory.

512
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:20,797
[distant moaning and groaning]

513
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,469
Artephius, please tell me that horrifying
groaning is coming from you.

514
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,305
[groans]

515
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,391
[moaning and groaning]

516
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,564
Zombies!

517
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,486
[fast, lively flamenco music playing]
