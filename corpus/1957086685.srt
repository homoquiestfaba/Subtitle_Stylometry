1
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,664
Please, sweetie, tell
me more about your day.

2
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:10,602
I saw Elmo at the zoo
and monkeys...

3
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,439
Really?
- Next to, to lot

4
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,606
of scary monsters.

5
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,874
I have to go.

6
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,242
Hey, hey, where you going?

7
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,412
Sweetie.

8
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,747
Hey.
- Hey.

9
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,852
You know, I need you to
level with me on something.

10
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,588
What was Elmo doing at the zoo?

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,089
He wasn't.

12
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,090
She just had way too much
sugar, mixing everything up.

13
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,091
It's driving me crazy.

14
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,498
Well, you know, I guess
this Elmo is a lot more

15
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,334
important than Daddy these days.

16
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,436
You know she misses you.

17
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,905
Not as much as I miss you.

18
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,574
I know, yeah, but
look at the bright side.

19
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,443
I mean, I'll be home in 23 days.

20
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,780
22 days and 45 minutes.

21
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,784
I have a surprise for you.

22
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,785
Really?
- I'll be right back.

23
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,765
Hey man, I'm gettin'
some strange readings

24
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,765
from the bottom.

25
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,401
Should we stop drilling?

26
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,579
No.

27
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,579
We could be at the
cusp of a reservoir.

28
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,217
Okay, but safety procedure
says we should shut

29
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,686
down if we can't
determine the cause

30
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,121
of the fluctuations.
- The safety procedure

31
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,956
also tell you that some jackass
from Holter Energy's gonna

32
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,592
call and get me fired
unless I start her up again?

33
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,061
Well then if you shut
her down now they may

34
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,764
offer you a bonus to
turn it back on again.

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,699
I'm not debating with you.

36
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,667
All right, I'm shutting it down.

37
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,667
Hey, hey, hey!

38
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,605
Relax, okay?

39
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,407
Look, man, I'm
gonna go get Billy.

40
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,775
The two of you can
figure it out, okay?

41
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,478
Billy's gonna say keep pumping.

42
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,478
Yeah whatever, man.

43
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,816
Are you ready?

44
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,816
Yeah.

45
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,759
So do you like it?

46
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,462
Baby.

47
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,932
Baby, baby, baby.

48
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,900
Billy.

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Billy.

50
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,638
Man, I'm on my lunch break.

51
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,141
I know, man, we got a
possible blow out on deck.

52
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,977
Honey, I gotta go.
- You don't like my surprise?

53
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,211
- No, no, I love your surprise
I just really gotta go.

54
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,849
I'll call you back.
- No, no, no, don't hang up!

55
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,686
- What's going on, Jack?

56
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,887
- We got the motherload coming.

57
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,089
- Even now while a
well was about to blow.

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,026
- Shut up, man.

59
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,995
- Move over.

60
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,736
Great, shut her down.

61
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,172
You should know better.

62
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,172
Shut her down!

63
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,313
Geez.

64
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,448
Get outta here!

65
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,555
Get down to the third floor!

66
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,425
- Come on, man,
what are you doing?

67
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,394
- Jake.

68
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,095
Go!

69
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,397
Get outta here now!

70
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,869
Go on, get out!

71
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,869
Come on get out!

72
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,878
- Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

73
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,878
- Come on.

74
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,618
Come here, I think this
place is gonna blow!

75
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,453
Leo!

76
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,348
- The right temperatures
and conditions have

77
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,852
to occur precisely in order
for these tubes to form.

78
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,654
Now, the lava on the surface cools

79
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,591
while the flow
underneath continues

80
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,493
eventually draining
into a catch basin,

81
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,962
which allows these
tubes to become hollow.

82
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,297
You know, these
tubes run for miles.

83
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,833
Now, there is a theory that there

84
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,236
are larger and longer tubes
that are below the surface,

85
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,773
which apparently occurred
during the Ice Age.

86
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,476
Okay, well, that's
all we have time for,

87
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,780
which brings me to
the announcement

88
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,148
of the students that'll be going

89
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,682
on the research trip
with me tomorrow.

90
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,683
Your names are on this board.

91
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,424
- Yes!

92
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,993
- Okay, class dismissed and I will

93
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,495
see those of you at
6:30 AM tomorrow.

94
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,602
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

95
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,805
My car wouldn't start.

96
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,805
- You weren't late,
you were absent.

97
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,109
- Can you please give me
a break just this once?

98
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,611
- Do I treat anybody
differently in this class?

99
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,481
- This is really
gonna affect my grade?

100
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,816
- Yes, it will.

101
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:32,450
- You promised me I could go.

102
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,654
- You promised that
you wouldn't be late.

103
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,559
- Is Brandon going on the trip?

104
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,993
- Yes, Brandon's
going on the trip.

105
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,229
- Well, what if I go
and I just observe?

106
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,230
No extra credit.

107
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,302
- Observe Brandon or the research?

108
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,804
- Come on, please.

109
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,272
Please, I really need this.

110
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,107
- Look.

111
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:55,942
- Please.

112
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,443
- One last time.

113
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,512
I swear, if you're late for
one more class you're out.

114
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,513
Sister or no sister.

115
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,150
Right.
- Okay?

116
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,418
- Thank you.

117
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,418
- Come on.

118
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,662
- I'm gonna make a brief statement

119
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,898
and then I'll take
all your questions.

120
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,605
Last night at
approximately 11:30PM

121
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,676
the Holter Energy offshore
rig Transocean Alpha

122
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,447
lost contact with
our central office.

123
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,719
Telemetry from the vessel
was lost at that time.

124
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,787
We sent out helicopters at dawn

125
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,924
to the last known coordinates
of the Transocean Alpha.

126
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,761
We have been unable to
locate the platform.

127
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,764
We're coordinating
with the Coast Guard.

128
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,269
We have four helicopters, 30
vessels searching the Gulf.

129
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,208
We will do everything
humanly possible

130
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,878
to locate our workers and
deliver them safely to shore.

131
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,414
- Is there an oil spill?

132
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,049
- Now, there's no sign of
an oil spill on the surface.

133
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,819
The Transocean Alpha has an
emergency release mechanism

134
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,657
that detached the rig
from the pipeline and cap.

135
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,760
We believe that the crew
detached the rig itself

136
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,663
and it's now free-floating
in the ocean.

137
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,198
We've set up a
search grid and we're

138
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,968
confident that we'll find her.

139
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,803
I'm gonna turn over the
rest of the press conference

140
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,307
to our chief engineering
officer, Ray Miller.

141
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,308
Ray, could you?

142
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,147
- The Transocean Alpha is the
most technologically-advanced

143
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,916
oil platform on the planet and we

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,152
are certain that we
will locate her soon.

145
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,021
- Sir, is it a possibility
that the rig sunk?

146
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,023
- It's possible, but unlikely.

147
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:57,029
Transocean Alpha is a 40,000
ton, 250 foot tall platform.

148
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,765
Now, right now we are
speculating that a rogue wave

149
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,635
may have hit the
platform and caused it

150
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:06,004
to become dislodged
from the pipeline.

151
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,039
It is highly unlikely
that any wave

152
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,045
can capsize the platform,
however we are sending ROVs

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,614
down to the well cap to make sure

154
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,416
that the Transocean
Alpha did not sink,

155
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,387
and we will be updating you
as soon as we know anything.

156
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,524
So if you'll excuse us, we
do have a lot of work to do.

157
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,060
- Okay, how about one question?

158
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,095
- Mr. Capilla, can I get
a one-on-one interview?

159
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,095
Mr. Capilla!

160
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,799
- Mr.
Miller, the people

161
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,634
have a right to know!

162
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,634
Mr. Miller!

163
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,574
- Yes.

164
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,444
Yes, Vernon, you genius.

165
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,314
Handsome and brilliant.

166
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,082
- Handsome maybe, but brilliant,

167
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,317
that's a bit of a stretch.

168
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,319
- I knew that you
were attracted to me.

169
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,286
- Serious, what have you found?

170
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,226
- I cross-matched the
samples from the Gulf

171
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,095
and then I ran that
against the Arnold samples.

172
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,164
- And?

173
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,164
- And...

174
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,170
chemically they match 99%.

175
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,106
- Yeah, but there's no way
the explosion in Arnold

176
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,908
would have left
deposits in Florida.

177
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,376
- I know, unless...

178
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,011
- It was an extinct
volcano in the Gulf.

179
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,212
So I was right.
- Right.

180
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,547
And maybe we'll find
that volcano on our trip

181
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,451
to Black Point, then you can
call it the Vitrini Volcano.

182
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,187
- Now that would be
very interesting.

183
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,555
- Did you book the
satellite time for INSA?

184
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,390
- Yes.

185
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,792
- Okay, great.

186
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,126
Thanks.

187
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,828
- I told you so.

188
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,828
Told you.

189
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,241
- Look, I still think we
should shut down the other rigs

190
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,677
till we find out what happened
to the Transocean Alpha.

191
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,180
- Are you crazy?

192
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,815
Those rigs are pumping half
a million barrels a day.

193
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,417
I'm not shutting anything down.

194
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,819
- It could cause an
ecological disaster.

195
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,121
It could fill the entire
Gulf of Mexico with oil.

196
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,190
- Safety valve on the ocean floor

197
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,258
would prevent anything
like that from happening.

198
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,228
Yeah, but it could fail.
- Not possible.

199
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,197
Thank you.
- Where are we?

200
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,431
- Well, ROV is
remaking its descent.

201
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,567
We should reach write
off some time tomorrow.

202
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,769
- Good.

203
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,437
Call me when it
gets to the bottom.

204
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:22,073
I'll be hiding from
the press till then.

205
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,074
- What about Project Subterranean?

206
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,948
- Would you excuse us?

207
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,183
Would you come into the
office for a second?

208
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,423
Never bring up
Project Subterranean

209
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,658
around anyone without
the proper clearance!

210
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,161
- I'm sorry.

211
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,662
I just think we need to step
things down until we find out

212
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,631
what happened out there.
- Subterranean is pumping

213
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,299
more than the other
rigs combined and I

214
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,835
am not stepping anything down.

215
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,973
If you break protocol
again, I will fire you.

216
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,441
Now, get out of my office.

217
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,651
- Hey, what's up?

218
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,119
- I know how you can
forget to eat sometimes

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,554
when you're all wrapped
up in your work.

220
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,656
- Thank you, that's sweet.

221
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,092
- You're welcome.

222
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,226
So are you going on the trip?

223
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,095
I'm tagging along,

224
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,930
but there's not enough
room on the short bus

225
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,265
for me so I have to ride with you.

226
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,767
- I don't think that's
the best of ideas.

227
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,803
- Why not?

228
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,005
- You're a student
who also happens

229
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,440
to be my boss's little sister.

230
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
It's not right.

231
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,011
- Okay.

232
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,347
Well, what if I rode
in the back seat?

233
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:40,219
It would be like Driving
Miss Daisy only sexier.

234
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,423
- Are you here to visit
me or harass my staff?

235
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,326
- I was just bringing
Brandon coffee and a muffin.

236
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,561
- I know how much

237
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,196
of a slave driver you can be, sis.

238
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,664
I mean, look at the poor guy.

239
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,599
He hasn't seen the outside
of a lab in six weeks.

240
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,434
- I know, poor thing.

241
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,434
Is that true, Brandon?

242
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,703
You're a little pasty.

243
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,274
- I can take it from
you guys one at a time,

244
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,309
but when you gang up
on me, it's not fair.

245
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,611
Can I just?

246
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,046
- Okay, we're getting
an early start

247
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,080
in the morning so get some rest.

248
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,348
And, Brandon, you're taking her.

249
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,348
What?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,522
- See, that wasn't
so bad, now was it?

251
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,692
- It depends on your
grounds of comparison.

252
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,530
That's Antoinette's.

253
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,530
This is mine, thank you.

254
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,201
Here you go.

255
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,170
Here you go.
- Thanks.

256
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,310
Okay, so everybody gather around.

257
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,380
So I've been thinking
that the Gulf itself

258
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,982
was created by a giant volcano.

259
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,518
Yes, Nelson?

260
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,986
- What about the meteor that
killed the dinosaurs theory?

261
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,622
- Well, that's not proven.

262
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,090
Yes, it could have
been an impact crater,

263
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,128
but I'm saying that it
was a reverse caldera.

264
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,697
Now that's kind of like
when a soap bubble pops

265
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,600
leaving an indentation
on the surface tension

266
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,303
of the water for a split second.

267
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,239
That's the Gulf and the
indentation is a volcano.

268
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,741
Okay, so we have a
grid for you guys

269
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,743
to follow and you
need to stick to it.

270
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,212
Use your GPS and don't
go out of the square.

271
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,381
I need soil temperatures,
rock samples,

272
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,850
tilt and swell
measurements every 15 feet.

273
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,851
Any questions?

274
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,889
Okay, I'll see you
back here at three.

275
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,889
Be observant and be safe.

276
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,331
- Do you wanna be my partner?

277
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,502
- Because you like me or
because you need an A?

278
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,737
- Actually, both.

279
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,344
- I don't think so.

280
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,327
- SO2 reading is 5 point ppms,

281
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,965
which is significantly
above average considering...

282
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,577
- Hey, Emily, check
this out, check this.

283
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,578
What does this say to you?

284
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,249
Ha, that's very funny, very funny.

285
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,218
Okay.

286
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,218
- What are you gonna give me?

287
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,288
- What's your deal?

288
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,258
- My deal is that you can't
stop focusing on science

289
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,229
for one second and
focus on biology.

290
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,167
- Thank you.

291
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,503
- You're such a schmuck sometimes.

292
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,092
- All right, everyone,
back into the vans.

293
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,496
Becky, can you get
a headcount for me?

294
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,496
- Sure, Dr. V.

295
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,933
- How is it for you?

296
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,168
- I don't know, just
everything seems abnormal.

297
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,035
Just not right.

298
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,537
- Yeah, same here.

299
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,972
- I found an
alligator on the shore that

300
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,240
looks to have been boiled.
- Three, four, five.

301
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,742
- Now we'll see when the
samples get run through the lab.

302
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,211
- You don't even have
to run the samples.

303
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,113
I tell you it smells like
sulfur dioxide all over there.

304
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,381
You were definitely right.

305
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,816
There's something
going on out here.

306
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,783
- All right, I'll
see you back there.

307
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,252
- Okay.

308
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,252
Here, I'll take that.

309
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,588
No, no, no, no, no, you don't.

310
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,623
No, you don't,
you're skinny enough.

311
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,224
They can squeeze you in the van.

312
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,292
- You think I'm skinny?

313
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,560
- Sure.

314
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
- Thanks.

315
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,434
- Seven, eight, nine, 10.

316
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,204
We're all good, Miss V.

317
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,305
- Great.

318
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,305
Buckle up.

319
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,716
- How can I help you, Ray?

320
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,716
- Something you need to see.

321
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,157
- All right, what am I looking at?

322
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,391
- Video from the
ROV descending down

323
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,761
to the well site of
the Transocean Alpha.

324
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,598
- My god, what is that?

325
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,000
What happened?

326
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,768
- I won't really know
until I get a sample up

327
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,437
to the surface but
that looks like magma.

328
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,540
We must have drilled
into a pocket of lava.

329
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,276
- Who else knows about this?

330
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,111
- I dismissed the technicians
from the telemetry lab

331
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,111
before the signal came in.

332
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,749
- No one can know about this.

333
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,385
- Well, what are we gonna do?

334
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,420
We can't just say we lost
a 40,000 ton drilling rig.

335
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,056
- I'll handle that.

336
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,291
- We are drilling on
extinct lava tubes

337
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,927
and apparently some of
them aren't so extinct.

338
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,296
We need to tell the authorities.

339
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,999
- You need to get
with the program, Ray.

340
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,434
If the authorities investigate
then they're gonna find out

341
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,870
about Project Subterranean,
and if they find out

342
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,608
about that then we are
both going to jail.

343
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,011
You weren't worried about
safety when you got your profit

344
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,614
participation check from
the project, were ya?

345
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,517
We can pump out of
there for generations

346
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,386
and no one would know.

347
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,388
- We have a press update
on the Transocean Alpha.

348
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,390
What am I supposed to tell them?

349
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,792
- Well, you tell them
that we have reason

350
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,094
to believe that the rig was hit

351
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,095
by a rogue wave, washed hundreds

352
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,631
of miles out to sea
and presumed sunk.

353
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,700
- They're gonna want
confirmation on that.

354
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,735
- And they will get it.

355
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,705
I'm gonna have the Beta
Horizon decommissioned,

356
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:52,610
towed 200 miles out, just edge
of the ocean shelf, scuttled.

357
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,346
Tomorrow, you go down
and take pictures

358
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,281
and I will issue a sad
statement of condolences

359
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,950
to the members of the
families of the workers.

360
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,253
- That's a huge undertaking.

361
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,454
- I'll handle that.

362
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,923
You go handle the freaking press.

363
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,593
And meet me at the bone
yard tomorrow morning.

364
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,529
- Yes, sir.

365
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,405
- Get me Butch Sanders.

366
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,924
- See anything interesting?

367
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,661
- What are you doing here, Brad?

368
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:46,231
I thought you were
somewhere in Iceland?

369
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,779
- Can a guy say hi to his
ex and not have a reason?

370
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,205
- That's right, you always
had a reason, right?

371
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:58,109
- I've been analyzing your data

372
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,111
and I think you may
be on to something.

373
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,847
- You've been looking
at my research?

374
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,548
- I still have
access to the server.

375
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,016
You son of a bitch.
- I told you to

376
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,618
change the password.

377
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,153
Look, easy, I'm a good guy, okay?

378
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,153
I'm here to help.

379
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,623
You want me to help?

380
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,824
- Obviously you haven't traveled
halfway across the world

381
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,594
because you don't know anything.

382
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,762
So why don't you just spit it out.

383
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,164
- How about over dinner tonight?

384
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,232
- No.

385
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,232
- Coffee?

386
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,604
- Fine.

387
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,671
- Come on, I'm buying.

388
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,672
- Fine.

389
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,247
- Don't touch me.

390
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,548
- Sorry, sorry.

391
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,382
Just coffee.

392
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,885
- No, I can't right now.

393
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,986
You just have to go onto FTP,
download the Black Point doc.

394
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,987
Okay?

395
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,390
I gotta go, I'll call you back.

396
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,390
Thanks.

397
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,561
Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,796
Antoinette told me you weren't

399
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,963
feeling very good so I
brought you some things.

400
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:56,801
- Well, I'm better
now but thank you.

401
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,802
- You're welcome.

402
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,327
- Yeah!

403
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,663
- All right, welcome to the Back

404
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,698
to the Beach Bikini Contest.

405
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,334
I want you to do me a favor.

406
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,702
Watch where you're
walking at 'cause things

407
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,170
can get slippery when wet.

408
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,372
In about five more
minutes we're gonna

409
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:39,543
bring out the fire round of girls!

410
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,046
- I don't know, Shauna,
a bikini is one thing,

411
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,881
but being sprayed down by
a water gun is another.

412
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,650
- Come on, live a little!

413
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,152
You're not gonna have
that rocking body forever.

414
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,387
- What if my parents see this?

415
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,655
Or worse, what if
your brother sees it?

416
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,656
- He'd probably flip
out and kill me.

417
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,892
- Hey, my bathing suit, girl.

418
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,093
Give us a big smile,
give us some love.

419
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,597
Show us who's winning $1000.

420
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,467
- Relax, no one's
ever gonna see that.

421
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,703
- He had a camera.

422
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,705
- All we need is a
little liquid courage.

423
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,706
Tequila.

424
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,310
- I hate you.

425
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,310
- That's my sorority sister.

426
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,749
- No!

427
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,757
- Okay, ladies, this is it.

428
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,292
We're gonna march
you out one at a time

429
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:31,061
so Tommy the fireman
can hose you down.

430
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,297
And do me a favor, sell
it, because there's

431
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,101
over $1000 up for the
winner, all right?

432
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,436
Are you ready?

433
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,436
No!
- Yeah!

434
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,578
- So I tell the Sherpa
that I wanna try

435
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,446
to reach the summit
before nightfall,

436
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,916
but my command of the Nagari
language isn't that good

437
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,585
and so he's looking at me sideways

438
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,921
and the other
Sherpa's cracking up.

439
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,556
- So what did you say to him?

440
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,792
- Apparently I asked him
to spend the night with me.

441
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,261
No?

442
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,796
- Yeah.

443
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,036
And he looked like he was up
for it until I cut him off.

444
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,304
- You know, we've been
sitting here for over an hour

445
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,440
and you've been regaling
about all your adventures

446
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:21,146
and travels but you haven't
gotten to the point, Bradley.

447
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,449
- You remember our
supervolcano theory?

448
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,851
- Yeah, my theory.

449
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,053
- Whatever.

450
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,220
Yeah, the theory that
the Gulf of Mexico

451
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,856
was created by a
supervolcano millions

452
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,358
of years ago during
the continental drift?

453
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,226
That theory, the one laughed
at by most scientists?

454
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,096
- Yeah, and I'm still
trying to prove it.

455
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,231
- I think you may
have found proof.

456
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,834
- How?

457
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:46,337
- I was analyzing your data
on the chemical composition

458
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:50,040
of the Alvera Volcano
and the samples you

459
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,610
took from the Panhandle.

460
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,610
- Yeah, I know they match.

461
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,213
- That's not all they match.

462
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,949
- What do you mean?

463
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,484
- They match the chemical makeup

464
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,787
of the crude oil being
pumped by Holter Energy.

465
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,623
I got a sample of it
from a friend of mine

466
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,758
when the drilling
platform went missing.

467
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,394
- And it matches exactly?

468
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,228
- Yeah.

469
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,397
That means that wherever
Holter is drilling,

470
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,501
it must be over some old vents
or lava tubes or something.

471
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,337
I mean, this could
lead to the big one.

472
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,307
- But how do they
know where to drill?

473
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,875
I mean, the alignment
of the platforms.

474
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,875
I mean, how can they tell?

475
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,179
- They must have
access to the ground

476
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,714
imaging scans you've been making.

477
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,715
- Yeah, but I haven't
published those yet.

478
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,716
- Yeah.

479
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,983
- Have you seen the seismic
readings we've been getting?

480
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,218
They're disturbing.

481
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,687
- The president is on the brink of

482
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,821
declaring a moratorium
on drilling.

483
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,822
That's what I find disturbing.

484
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,492
What's going on, Butch?

485
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,429
- Rumblings here and there.

486
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,101
Real concern is the oil
temperature heating up.

487
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,369
- What's causing it?

488
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,406
- I don't know yet, but
we'll figure it out.

489
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,775
- Did you take care of
that other little problem?

490
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,712
- The decommissioned rig
was scuttled last night.

491
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,713
No witnesses.

492
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,818
- It looks like you
have a job to do, Ray.

493
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,453
Take pictures, schedule a press

494
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,254
conference for tomorrow morning.

495
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,923
- That can wait, this can't.

496
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,057
We need to shut down
this facility now!

497
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,359
It's too damn dangerous!

498
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,428
- That wasn't a request, Ray.

499
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,897
I will handle this
down here now get going

500
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:57,402
unless you wanna check out
my early retirement plan.

501
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,042
- All right, all right, I'm goin'.

502
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,910
- The guy is such a wimp.

503
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,048
- I can take care of him.

504
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,183
- Forget about him.

505
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:17,322
How many barrels of oil a day
are we pumping outta here?

506
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,225
- 277 barrels a minute.

507
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,760
- That's good, good, but we need

508
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,763
to get as much product outta
here as quickly as possible.

509
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,533
Are your men all in line?

510
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,534
- My guys are tight as a drum.

511
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,736
- Good.

512
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:32,971
- They're making
more money in a week

513
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,971
than they normally make in a year.

514
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Nobody's talking.

515
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,910
- Then increase the flow.

516
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,880
Can you give me 600,000
barrels of oil a day?

517
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,650
- I can push it as
far as it'll go.

518
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,827
470, that's the best I can do.

519
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,530
- When was the last
time you manually

520
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,098
aligned the conductors?

521
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,733
- Never.

522
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,734
That's what computers are for.

523
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,972
- Let me show you how I became CEO

524
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,509
of the most profitable drilling
company in North America.

525
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,712
It wasn't by sitting
in front of a computer.

526
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,048
Crank it up when I tell you.

527
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,790
Now!

528
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,694
- 520!

529
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
- More!

530
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,343
- 600,000!

531
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,179
- What I tell ya?

532
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:20,144
- All right, without further
ado, we have Kimberly from LSU!

533
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,585
Go Kimberly, go Kimberly,
go Kimberly, go Kimberly!

534
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,487
Go Kimberly!
- Look at how how she is.

535
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,955
I can't do this.

536
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,290
- Please, you are so much
prettier than she is.

537
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,859
Okay, well, you don't
have to show 'em

538
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,728
the girls if you don't want to.

539
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,962
- Do I have to be assaulted
by a water pistol?

540
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,299
- Yes, but I promise I'll look
like a bigger slut than you.

541
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,768
- Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

542
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,939
No, but $1000 is.
- Yo, Tommy, cool her off!

543
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,913
Next up we have Annie
from Florida State.

544
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,389
- All right.

545
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,292
- Annie, Annie, Annie.

546
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:30,682
Now, for our final contestant,
Shauna, Queen of the Jungle!

547
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,423
Show me what you got,
show me what you got.

548
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,458
Show me what you got,
show me what you got.

549
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,528
Show me what you got,
show me what you got.

550
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,165
Woo, ooh, that's what
I'm talking about, baby!

551
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,584
Go Shauna, go Shauna!

552
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,020
Go Shauna, go Shauna, go!

553
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:14,658
Go Shauna, go Shauna,
go Shauna, go Shauna!

554
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,659
- Help!

555
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:22,066
Help, help!

556
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,270
Help, help, help me!

557
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,723
- Shauna, are you okay?

558
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,897
We gotta go, come on.

559
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,901
Come on!

560
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,968
Shauna!
- Annie!

561
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,968
- Shauna!

562
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,872
Shauna, Shauna!

563
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,049
- No.

564
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,101
- A magnitude 5.6 earthquake hit

565
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,003
off the coast of
Miami this afternoon.

566
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,573
What followed on the
beach has scientists

567
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,808
and local officials
scratching their heads.

568
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:16,012
Over 100 people were killed
by what some observers

569
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,416
describe as a
superheated wall of steam

570
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,486
that hit the beach shortly
after the earthquake.

571
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,521
We now go live to
Colonel Anderson.

572
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,590
- Mayor Alvarez has
enlisted the services

573
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,259
of the National Guard to
investigate what's going on.

574
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,761
As soon as we have
some information,

575
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,497
I will release a press statement.

576
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,497
- About a dozen
Downtown businesses...

577
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,868
- A steam tsunami.

578
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,503
- Is that possible?

579
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:42,005
- I've seen the results of
one once off of Micronesia.

580
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,275
- So we have a
supervolcano on our hands.

581
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,978
- I know of a abandoned
missile silo off the coast

582
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,980
from the Cuban Missile Crisis.

583
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,215
It's deep.

584
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,517
I can get good gas and temperature

585
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,252
and tilt readings from there.

586
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,419
Okay.
- Wanna come?

587
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,654
- No, I can't.

588
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,922
I mean, they're gonna warn people.

589
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,290
I kinda need a
better understanding

590
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,892
about what's happening too.

591
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,959
- I'll go with you.

592
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,959
- All right, let's go.

593
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,197
Hey, be careful.

594
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,131
- I will.

595
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,966
I'll see you guys later night.

596
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,201
Brandon, we need to
go to Holter Energy

597
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,603
to see if they know anything
about the situation.

598
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,872
- What, why them?

599
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,807
- I don't know, I
just have a hunch.

600
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,944
The choice of drilling sites
is a little bit suspect.

601
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,146
- Well, can you fill
me in on your hunch?

602
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,146
- Yeah, I'll let
you know in the car.

603
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,322
- I'm sure you all
are aware by now

604
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,326
that Jacob was killed in the
blow-off at Subterranean.

605
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,695
So until we can figure
out what happened

606
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,298
that facility will
remain decommissioned.

607
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,034
- Understood.

608
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,034
We're depending on you now, Ray.

609
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,638
Matter fact, we took
a vote of the board

610
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,577
and if you're willing we'd
like to nominate you as CEO.

611
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,882
- There are some things that Jacob

612
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,882
did you all should know about.

613
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,852
- We know about everything, Ray,

614
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,923
and we're all liable if this
thing should get outta hand.

615
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,560
We wanna give you Jacob's cut.

616
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,464
And as an added
motivation we're gonna

617
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:19,470
give you 40% of all the revenue
produced by that facility.

618
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,209
Now we need you to
pump everything out

619
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,215
of there you can in a month
and then we shut it down.

620
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,584
Then we fill that damn thing with

621
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,387
concrete and nobody
knows anything.

622
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,588
- 50%.

623
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,895
- Done.

624
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:48,199
- I have the ROV video
of the scuttled rig.

625
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,202
At my news conference today I will

626
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:54,638
announce the loss of
the Transocean Alpha.

627
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,808
I will also inform
the public that Jacob

628
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,278
died of a heart attack
upon hearing the news.

629
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,716
- That is a nice touch.

630
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,985
- Thank you.

631
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
Thank you.

632
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,857
Meeting's adjourned.

633
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,305
You can invite the press up
to the conference room now.

634
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,557
- All right, we're here.

635
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,065
- So what happened?

636
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,065
- What do you mean?

637
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,203
- Antoinette never talked about
you two after the divorce.

638
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,973
- We divorced,
that's what happened.

639
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,509
- But you still
love her, don't you?

640
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,813
- Yeah, probably always will.

641
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,515
- I'm sorry.

642
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,817
- It's all right.

643
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:15,486
And it's good to see
you again anyway.

644
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,756
Last time I saw you...

645
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,859
You were just an awkward
little high school girl

646
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,060
with a mouth full of braces.

647
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,696
- Thanks for reminding me.

648
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,696
- That's what I'm here for.

649
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,938
- We have confirmed the location
of the Transocean Alpha.

650
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,043
There were no survivors.

651
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,515
It was washed out to
sea by a rogue wave

652
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,686
and sank from the
damage it had sustained.

653
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:55,291
Our hearts go out to the
families of the crew members.

654
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:59,562
Recovery of any remains
is highly unlikely,

655
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,232
but our search and rescue teams

656
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:05,301
will be combing the
waters through Tuesday.

657
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,302
- Why isn't Jacob Capilla here?

658
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,876
- That is the other reason
why I have gathered you all.

659
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,743
There is other sad news.

660
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,718
Upon discovering the fate
of the Transocean Alpha,

661
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,857
Jacob Capilla suffered a massive

662
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,858
heart attack and died last night.

663
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,204
I have been named as interim CEO

664
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,074
and will be in charge
of recovery efforts.

665
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:50,080
Our thoughts and our prayers
go out to the Capilla family.

666
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,084
That is all for now.

667
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,991
- Tilt meters are setup and ready.

668
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:01,926
- The gas chromatograph
and thermal

669
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,727
imaging sensor are ready.

670
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,929
- All right, good.

671
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,030
Just stick close behind
me and do as I say.

672
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,699
It's gonna be a long climb down.

673
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,701
- Don't worry, I've got your back.

674
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,814
- Yes, but not all of the wells

675
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,050
are necessarily congruent
with the radar maps.

676
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,153
I mean, coincidence may
still be a possibility.

677
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,856
Don't we wanna investigate?

678
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:32,690
- Yeah, I do.

679
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,690
That's what we're doing.

680
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,930
- Dr. Vitrini, I
don't have much time.

681
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,399
Frankly, I wouldn't see you
at all during this crisis,

682
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,336
but the outrageous
messages you left

683
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,404
with my secretary,
they got my attention.

684
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,473
Who is this?

685
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,608
I'm Brandon.
- This is Brandon Rice,

686
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,608
my research partner.

687
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,245
- You got five minutes.

688
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,883
- I'm sorry to hear about
your Transocean Alpha.

689
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,985
So am I, but that's
not why you're here.

690
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,986
- No, it's not.

691
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,423
I wanna know exactly how
you got hold of my research.

692
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,926
- Excuse me?

693
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,961
- My research, how exactly
did you get hold of it?

694
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,765
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

695
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,766
- I think you do.

696
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,203
I mean, you're the chief engineer

697
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,203
and scientific officer of Holter.

698
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,808
Your department is the one
who placed the well sites.

699
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,678
Now each one of those well sites

700
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,282
matches the ground radar
scans that I have been mapping

701
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,785
in the Gulf Coast for
the last 10 years.

702
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,355
But do you know what I
can't quite figure out?

703
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,258
Is how those volcanic tubes would

704
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,961
lead you to the oil reserves.

705
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,263
- This is preposterous.

706
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,266
I don't waste my time
on academic research.

707
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,635
I conduct my own.

708
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,904
I choose the spots based
on mineral deposits.

709
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,006
You know, you are
as crazy in person

710
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,143
as you sound on those messages.

711
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,179
Well, I guess I had
to hear it for myself.

712
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,180
Five minutes are up,
there's the door.

713
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,323
- If you have discovered
volcanic activity and you're

714
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,325
putting millions at
risk for the sake

715
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,995
of your profit I will find out.

716
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,798
And when I prove it I will make

717
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,168
sure your ass ends up in jail.

718
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:31,408
- I suggest you leave now
before I call security.

719
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,631
- All right.

720
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,236
I just used these
a few months ago.

721
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,537
They should be good.

722
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,537
- Let's hope so.

723
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,909
- All right, just
stay close behind me.

724
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,411
- I got your back, remember?

725
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,411
- All right.

726
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,081
- Got it?

727
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,218
Okay, let's do this.

728
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,529
Doing okay?

729
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,347
- Something's not right.

730
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,347
It's hot as hell in here.

731
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,184
Go back!

732
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,719
Go back, come on!
- What?

733
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,853
My god, my god!

734
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,089
Go back up!
- I'm going!

735
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,891
Go back!
- I'm going, I'm going!

736
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:56,026
- Go, hurry!

737
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,262
Go!

738
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,733
Keep going, keep going!

739
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,435
Keep on going!
- It's so hot.

740
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,437
- Keep going!

741
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,305
Keep going!

742
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,139
Go!

743
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,275
Go!

744
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,275
Go!

745
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,179
Go, hurry!

746
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,179
Go!

747
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,215
Run!

748
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,315
- I'm confused.

749
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,315
I'm confused, did that go well?

750
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,186
- I got what I wanted.

751
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,187
- What was that thing you
planted under his desk?

752
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,423
- We need to get evidence.

753
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,225
- What are you doing right now?

754
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,493
Are you doing this here?

755
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:04,961
This is not legal,
I don't think it.

756
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,564
- Well, despite popular belief,
two wrongs do make a right.

757
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,565
- Yeah, it worked out fine.

758
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,371
Wait till the cost
reports come in.

759
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:17,474
The scrap metal alone is
worth more than my house.

760
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,891
I'll come by after
I finish up here.

761
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,993
What the hell?

762
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,973
Let me call you back.

763
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,993
Get me Butch!

764
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,397
- Damn!

765
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,987
Come on, come on, come on.

766
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,156
Come on, come on, come on.

767
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,538
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

768
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,539
Come on!

769
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,256
- It's a wireless repeater.

770
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,262
That means whoever was
downloading information

771
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,965
from your computer had
to be physically close.

772
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,668
It was that woman from
the university today.

773
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,669
She knows we stole her research.

774
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,739
- How long ago she plant this?

775
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,908
- 10 minutes.

776
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,879
- Depending on her network,
she coulda copied a quarter

777
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,082
of your hard drive
before you shut her down.

778
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,321
- She was looking for
proof and the way my luck's

779
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,557
been going today she's got it!

780
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,998
I like you, Butch.

781
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:03,573
Question is, can I trust
you the way Jacob did?

782
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,476
- Anything you need.

783
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,746
Anything.

784
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:23,593
- I want you to find
this bitch and kill her.

785
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,932
And I want you to destroy her lab

786
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:33,937
and every ounce of
research you find in it.

787
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,772
- Consider it done.

788
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,055
This is important.

789
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,158
I need you to go
to the university.

790
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,159
Find Dr. Vitrini's lab.

791
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,163
Burn it.

792
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,368
And I mean to the ground.

793
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,885
Something's not right.

794
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,121
- Yeah, the repeater's
not working.

795
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,957
- Let me try something,
let me see this.

796
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,327
- Son of a bitch!

797
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,800
- They're shooting at us.

798
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,001
Go, go, go!

799
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,001
Go!

800
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,345
- Is anyone behind us?

801
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,547
- I don't know.

802
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,915
I think we lost him.

803
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,884
- What the hell is going on?

804
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,085
Why the hell are
they shooting at us?

805
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,353
- I don't know.

806
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,320
Obviously we're on the right path.

807
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,321
Who are you calling?

808
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,321
- Emily.

809
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,524
You call the cops.

810
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,027
Emily, neither one

811
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,630
of you are picking up
your phones right now.

812
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,165
I need to speak to Brad.

813
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,466
- Yes, I'd like to
report a shooting.

814
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,067
- Give me a call when
you get this message.

815
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,803
- No, no, no, we're okay.

816
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,803
Yes, my name is Brandon Rice.

817
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,740
And Antoinette Vitrini.

818
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,742
V-I-T-R-I-N-I.

819
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,244
Yes, that's her.

820
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,281
Yes, she's sitting
right next to me.

821
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,954
Okay, we'll be right there.

822
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:33,657
- What?

823
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,093
- We need to go
back to the campus.

824
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,060
- Why?

825
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
- Our lab is on fire.

826
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,305
- Where, in Miami?

827
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,373
- According to a theory
that I've been working on,

828
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:55,811
and that's why Holter Energy's
drilling is so reckless.

829
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,781
I mean, look, this
is no coincidence.

830
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,815
They have my files.

831
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,751
- Why haven't there
been any eruptions?

832
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:04,019
- Look, the tragedy at
Miami Beach was the result

833
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,121
of eruptions and
there's gonna be more.

834
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,257
Someone is trying to kill me.

835
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,160
It's not because I'm crazy.

836
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,962
It's because I know something and

837
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,962
they don't want anyone to know.

838
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,001
- Look, I can call Colonel
Anderson at the Guard Bureau.

839
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,971
Let them know your theory on
Holter Energy and Miami Beach,

840
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,205
but that's the best I can do.

841
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,673
- Okay, so why the National Guard?

842
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,041
- They're investigating
the incident.

843
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,041
I'll let you know what they say.

844
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:31,347
Yeah, yeah, tell him
I'm working on it.

845
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,149
I know, just do what you can.

846
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,918
- Is anything salvageable?

847
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:35,919
- Not much.

848
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,953
- What about my computer?

849
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,790
- The LCD is toast, but the
hard drive should be okay.

850
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,795
- Is that Emily?

851
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,364
- No, I gotta take this though.

852
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,364
- All right.

853
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,837
- Have you lost your mind?

854
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,706
- We've got a problem, you and I.

855
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:57,807
- I figured that much when I saw

856
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,576
your guy point an AK at my head.

857
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,077
Let me guess, you
torched the school too?

858
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:04,280
- Look, you march into my
office with that psycho

859
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,615
then you plant a
bug under my desk?

860
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,018
- I didn't do that, she did.

861
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,353
- And we were trying
to kill her not you.

862
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,421
- Coulda fooled me.

863
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,958
- You are on those files.

864
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,360
I paid you well for that research

865
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,963
and you're gonna go
to jail right along

866
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,098
with me if you don't do something.

867
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,035
- What do you want me to do, Ray?

868
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:29,038
- You get the files from
her then you silence her.

869
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,440
- What?

870
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,641
- They're gonna be
looking at me closely now,

871
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:34,343
but if there are no
files there's no proof.

872
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,012
And if there's no
Dr. Vitrini then

873
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,147
there's nothing that they can do.

874
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,148
- I didn't sign up for this.

875
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,086
- I don't think you have
a choice here, Mr. Rice.

876
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:44,921
- Okay.

877
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,857
I'm gonna, I'm
gonna need a minute.

878
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,225
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

879
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,225
- You got 30 minutes.

880
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,031
- Okay, so the police have
the National Guard coming.

881
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,232
- We need to get as much
info off that hard drive

882
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,135
as we can to make this
case against these jerks.

883
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,370
- Okay.

884
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,638
- You know what,
I'll deal with it.

885
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:02,606
- Are you sure, I
can do that quick.

886
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,606
- No.

887
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,764
- Come on, come on, go!

888
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,433
Into the ball!

889
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,035
- I'm trying, coach!

890
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:34,304
Come on!

891
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,067
- There's no license
plate on the front, okay?

892
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,535
- Right, right, right, yeah.

893
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,437
Sure, sure, we'll.

894
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,206
We'll finish it later.

895
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,075
- Okay.

896
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:48,844
- Sir, Chief Michaels,
Brandon Rice.

897
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,979
- Thank you.

898
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,848
I'm gonna grab
Antoinette real quick.

899
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,782
- As soon as they're done we'll

900
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,782
head back to the base with you.

901
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,759
Ride's here.
- That was quick.

902
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,759
- Yeah.

903
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,401
- What are you doing?

904
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:13,970
- Nothing, I'm just seeing
what we're working with here.

905
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:15,705
- Okay.

906
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,808
- What's the plan once
we get to the base?

907
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,543
- Well, we need to
find the main door

908
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,711
and relieve the pressure
if we get the chance.

909
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,913
- Wait, like lancing a boil.

910
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,913
- Correct, if we find it.

911
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,484
- Okay.

912
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,788
- I'm gonna download the
EDMS for the harmonic tremors

913
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,524
and that'll narrow
our search for us.

914
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,960
- Do you have the GNS hardware?

915
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,295
- It's right here.

916
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,295
- Great.

917
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,331
- Okay, I'm gonna
run to the truck.

918
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,134
- How long do you need?

919
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,237
- 10 minutes.

920
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,237
- Perfect.

921
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,441
Come on.

922
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,244
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

923
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,881
Got it.

924
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,026
Antoinette!

925
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,027
- What's wrong?

926
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,964
Where's Brad?

927
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,803
Look, I need you to
calm down, Emily,

928
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,804
and tell me what happened.

929
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,742
- He's dead.

930
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,011
- What?

931
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,445
Who did this?

932
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:31,214
- I tried to.

933
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,214
I'm so sorry.

934
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,651
He almost made it.

935
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,855
I tried.

936
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,855
I'm so sorry.

937
00:57:56,472 --> 00:57:57,507
- Yeah.

938
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,175
- Is it done?

939
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,844
- What do you think?

940
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,779
- You're running
out of time, Brandon.

941
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,180
- So are you, Ray.

942
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
- What do you mean?

943
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,618
- I'm not a killer, never
have been and never will be.

944
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,720
- You are making a big mistake.

945
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,022
- No, no, no.

946
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,390
You made the mistake
when you chose

947
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,059
to build an illegal
drilling facility

948
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,827
in the heart of Downtown Miami.

949
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,662
- How do you know
about the facility?

950
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,864
- I'm not stupid.

951
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,832
Out of all the images I gave you,

952
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,500
the most promising were in
the heart of Downtown Miami.

953
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:26,736
And that's when
Holter bought up all

954
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:28,937
that factory space and
spent all kinds of money

955
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,440
in construction trying
to refurbish it.

956
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,842
But there was never
anything in the press

957
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,842
about what it was for.

958
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,614
That must have been a
bitch to keep quiet.

959
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:41,217
- You are smart, Brandon.

960
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,353
You gonna die smart.

961
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,621
- I'm smart enough to tell the

962
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,621
authorities everything I know.

963
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,257
That's exactly what
I plan on doing.

964
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:55,865
Hey, five minutes, guy.

965
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,533
Ready to go.

966
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:58,601
- Look.

967
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,601
This isn't your fault.

968
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:03,672
I really, really
need you right now.

969
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,275
Look, there's a truck
outside taking us

970
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,276
to the National Guard.

971
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,276
Let's go, okay?

972
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,858
- At ease.

973
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:27,095
Tactical Team Bravo,
I have Mayor Alvarez,

974
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,865
the chief of police, and two
civilian scientists on the way.

975
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,301
I want the command center
up and operational,

976
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,336
running, in 30 minutes.

977
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,337
Fall out!

978
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,643
Yes, general, it's done.

979
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,911
30 minutes.

980
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,911
Yes, sir.

981
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,057
- Anybody out here?

982
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:55,224
Are you crazy, lady?

983
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,961
Get outta town,
gotta get outta town.

984
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,955
- Gentlemen, this
is Dr. Vitrini.

985
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,591
- Dr. Vitrini, Colonel Anderson.

986
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:29,892
This is Mayor Alvarez.

987
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,892
Private, park that vehicle.

988
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,465
- Well, first we have
to locate the lava dome.

989
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,434
It's gotta be somewhere
in Miami, obviously.

990
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,969
I need a helicopter and
some radar equipment.

991
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,105
- Lieutenant, make sure
there's a pilot on alert.

992
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,707
The airspace will be
closed within an hour

993
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,676
because of the air so you
better do this quickly.

994
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,644
- Brandon, go and
get the GNS setup.

995
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:50,046
- Okay.

996
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,280
- All right, I got a theory.

997
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,849
It's the cold cap, which you guys

998
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,150
tested during the
BP spill in 2010.

999
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,686
- Didn't work.

1000
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,621
- That's 'cause you injected
directly into the sea bed.

1001
01:00:58,621 --> 01:00:59,856
- What is a cold cap?

1002
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,057
- It's liquid nitrogen.

1003
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,458
We attempted to
freeze the oil spill

1004
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,360
at the epicenter, turning
the water into ice

1005
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,095
and the oil into a solid.
- Creating a cap made

1006
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:08,263
of ice thus containing the oil.

1007
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:09,332
- And who are you?

1008
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,767
- Her accomplice.

1009
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,635
- Okay, the cold cap doesn't
work under the water.

1010
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,137
It works underground,
but I'm gonna

1011
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:16,605
need massive amounts
of liquid nitrogen.

1012
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:17,540
- That shouldn't be a problem.

1013
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,775
Every oil company in the state

1014
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:21,276
owes us from picking
up their mistakes.

1015
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:24,813
Lieutenant Sanborn, get Eldridge
from the 143 on the horn.

1016
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,215
Tell him we need immediate access

1017
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,884
to the nearest
chemical plant stat.

1018
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,152
What else?

1019
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,319
- Okay, I'm gonna
need heavy digging

1020
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,587
equipment and a
platoon or two of men.

1021
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:32,855
- And what are you
gonna do with them

1022
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,490
- I'm gonna find
the access and the

1023
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,491
spill-off point of the lava dome.

1024
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,894
- I'm gonna open it
up and cool the lava

1025
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,763
that comes out with
liquid nitrogen.

1026
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,432
- A liquid nitrogen bomb.

1027
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,933
- More or less.

1028
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,702
- You find the dome, you'll
have the equipment and the men.

1029
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,669
- All right, thank you.

1030
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:47,904
Emily's gonna stay with you.

1031
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:48,871
She knows everything
that's going on

1032
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,139
so utilize her as you want.

1033
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,908
- There's a tactical
uplink in the chopper.

1034
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:52,909
Radio us when you
have the coordinates.

1035
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,876
- All right.

1036
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,144
- Emily, come over here with me.

1037
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,144
- Wouldn't wanna be
in your shoes, mayor.

1038
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,183
- Okay, the cold
cap's in progress.

1039
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,617
- Why, that's never
gonna work, you know it.

1040
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,019
- It's gonna give us some time.

1041
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,387
- Okay.

1042
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,387
GNS is in sync.

1043
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,203
- Okay, so you're good?

1044
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,572
- We just crossed
the dome's perimeter.

1045
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,573
We're in it now.

1046
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,278
- Okay, move to the next grid.

1047
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:34,916
- Antoinette, there's something
that I need to tell you.

1048
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,917
- What?

1049
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:38,821
- It was me.

1050
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:40,856
- What are you talking about?

1051
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:42,625
- I sold your research to Holter.

1052
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:45,026
- Come on, Brandon, get serious.

1053
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,462
What are you doing?
- I am serious.

1054
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:51,199
They contacted me and
I needed the money.

1055
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
And...

1056
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,403
I'm sorry.

1057
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,006
- Next grid.

1058
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,711
- Did you hear what I said?

1059
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:04,647
- You know what, I don't wanna
ever see your face again.

1060
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,150
- I know.

1061
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:09,584
- So who was your contact?

1062
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,585
- Ray Miller.

1063
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,356
- So when we went to his office

1064
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:18,994
to confront him you just
pretended not to know him?

1065
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,329
I mean, he tried to shoot us.

1066
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,032
And that thought didn't
even cross your mind?

1067
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,835
- One thing I can think
of is why the hell

1068
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:27,835
is this happening?

1069
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:33,276
I know I screwed up, I'm sorry,

1070
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,512
but you need me and
we're the only people

1071
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,381
who know how to stop this thing.

1072
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,615
- So why did they need my data?

1073
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:41,851
- They theorized
that in areas where

1074
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:44,119
there's high volcanic
temper and sediment,

1075
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,923
there's also greater possibility
of large oil reserves.

1076
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,092
- So Brad was right.

1077
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:52,894
They were using my mapping
data to place their wells.

1078
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,230
- How did Brad find out?

1079
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,398
- Well, the oil samples at Holter

1080
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,101
matched the chemical
components of the Alvera rock.

1081
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,504
- Right.

1082
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,572
- Damn it, Brandon!

1083
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Next grid.

1084
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,056
- Where is she?

1085
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:24,626
- She's in a helicopter
surveying the area.

1086
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,962
They're meant to land back
here when they're done.

1087
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,664
- Look, I need to get her alone.

1088
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,967
- Yeah, well, she's
been surrounded

1089
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,737
by the top brass ever
since she got here.

1090
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,910
- You think of something
and get back to me.

1091
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,911
- Aye, aye, sir.

1092
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,237
- That's it!

1093
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,472
It's on Olive and Third.

1094
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,275
- That's the worst place possible.

1095
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:14,809
- Yes, smack bang Downtown.

1096
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:15,978
Let's get back to base.

1097
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:16,912
- How are we supposed to vent this

1098
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:17,847
in the middle of the city?

1099
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,115
- When we get it back I need you

1100
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:21,549
to map out various
venting scenarios.

1101
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,686
Anything on land's gonna be dicey.

1102
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,656
Dr. Vitrini to Colonel Anderson.

1103
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,460
- Colonel Anderson, over.

1104
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,895
- We located the lava
dome at Olive and Third.

1105
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,731
- Olive and Third, copy.

1106
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:38,333
- Did you manage to locate
the liquid nitrogen?

1107
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,935
- We've located
about 400,000 gallons

1108
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:43,004
in containment units at
the O'Hare Chemical Plant.

1109
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,240
- How quickly can you
get that downtown?

1110
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,909
- I have four semis waiting
on their loading dock

1111
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,077
as we speak.

1112
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:50,178
- Are these trucks
temperature-controlled?

1113
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,647
- Yes.

1114
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:54,082
- We're just seeing where we're
gonna pinpoint the cold cap.

1115
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,718
- I'll have my men shovel
out to Olive and Third

1116
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:58,219
and wait in the center
till further notification.

1117
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,355
- Okay, sounds like a plan.

1118
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:01,656
- How far is the
chemical plant to base?

1119
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:03,359
- It's close, right
across the freeway.

1120
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,827
- Okay, great, is Emily there?

1121
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,796
- Yes, standing right next to me.

1122
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:09,531
- Emily, look, I need
you at the chemical plant

1123
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,500
to run the static air against the

1124
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,469
thermal protection of the trucks.

1125
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,871
These need to be at
200 negative degrees

1126
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,108
to maximize the LN2
that we're using.

1127
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,310
- Copy.

1128
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,645
How do I get to
the chemical plant?

1129
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,113
- I'll have someone escort you.

1130
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:27,315
Private, take Miss Vitrini
to the chemical plant.

1131
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,853
- Right away, sir.

1132
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,625
- We're out of time!

1133
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:42,797
- I'll monitor the harmonic
tremors to determine the

1134
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,266
speed the lava's moving
through the conduits.

1135
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:46,902
It'll be on clock.

1136
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,204
- Yeah, but it's a
ticking time bomb.

1137
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,205
How far away are we
away from the base?

1138
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:05,087
- All good?

1139
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:07,856
- Cooler's on as low as it'll go.

1140
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,191
- I hope it's enough.

1141
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,626
We should head back.

1142
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,595
- There's supposed to be another
platoon at the south dock.

1143
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:13,596
Should we check?

1144
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:14,830
- Let's do it.

1145
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,830
- This way.

1146
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,603
- Colonel, Chief?

1147
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,811
All right, so this
is the lava dome.

1148
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,846
This is the area that we're
gonna be penetrating carefully.

1149
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,115
- That's a big area.

1150
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,650
Where exactly do you
plan on piercing it?

1151
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,519
- Well, Brandon and I are
working on that right now.

1152
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,953
- The team on the ground is
using a gravity gradient meter

1153
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,556
to determine actually how deep

1154
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,624
below the surface the dome is.

1155
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:43,859
- Well, now, hold
on, there are some

1156
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,127
high rent districts
down in that area.

1157
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,595
- Well, not anymore.

1158
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:48,696
Colonel, I assume you have
the explosives and the

1159
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,332
engineering teams on standby
with the liquid nitrogen.

1160
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,835
- We have some, it all depends
on how deep we have to go.

1161
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,371
- Okay, we need to get prepped.

1162
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:57,372
- Well, I don't know about
blowing a hole in South Miami.

1163
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,774
- There's going to be an eruption

1164
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,109
in Miami in the next few hours.

1165
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,844
Now we can let it
destroy the entire city

1166
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,379
or we can tell it where to
erupt and contain the situation.

1167
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,380
It's your choice.

1168
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:13,022
- Which way to the South Dock?

1169
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,391
What are you doing?

1170
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,391
- His job.

1171
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,833
You Vitrini girls have
become a liability.

1172
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,835
- Who are you?

1173
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:26,802
- Shh.

1174
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,604
- What's going on?

1175
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:31,140
- Patience, you'll find out.

1176
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,850
- Hello?

1177
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:43,017
- I need you to listen closely

1178
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,354
if you want to see your
sister alive again.

1179
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,357
- Who is this?

1180
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,025
- Ray Miller.

1181
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,527
- Don't listen to
him, it's a trap!

1182
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:52,862
- Shut her up.

1183
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,862
Come here!
- No!

1184
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,565
- What do you want,
you son of a bitch?

1185
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,401
- Come to the chemical
plant and you come alone.

1186
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:03,505
Bring the laptop with the
files that you stole from me.

1187
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,506
Fair exchange.

1188
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,677
You got 15 minutes or she's dead.

1189
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,855
Kill her, get rid of the body.

1190
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,123
- No, let me go!

1191
01:09:21,124 --> 01:09:23,292
- Shut up and move, darlin'!

1192
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:34,270
- What are you doing?

1193
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,938
- Just get me a timeline of
the best way to vent the dome.

1194
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,173
- Where are you going??

1195
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,173
- I'll be back.

1196
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:46,514
- Move it, cupcake.

1197
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,515
Move along.

1198
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:51,687
- Help, somebody help me!

1199
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,856
- Bitch, shut up, shut up!

1200
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,859
Play nice.

1201
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
Bitch!

1202
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,642
- Miller!

1203
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,513
I've got what you want!

1204
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:53,513
- Bring it up here.

1205
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,820
- You come down.

1206
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:02,023
- Look, this is not a negotiation.

1207
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:04,024
The stairs are to your right.

1208
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,104
- You can't hide forever!

1209
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:01,383
You are really trying my
patience, pretty girl.

1210
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,244
- Six, two, five, zero, zero.

1211
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,212
You son of a bitch.

1212
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,252
How's this coming?

1213
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:39,755
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

1214
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:44,026
We don't have time for this.

1215
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,894
Got you.

1216
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,894
Okay, go to the next screen.

1217
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,470
- I have your files
on my computer.

1218
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,041
- Hand it over.

1219
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,041
- I wanna see my sister.

1220
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,710
- She's safe, trust me.

1221
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,446
- No, I wanna see my sister now.

1222
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,816
I have them backed up.

1223
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,719
They're on my server,
they're encrypted.

1224
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,162
- Now why in the hell would
you wanna go on and do that?

1225
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,328
Fine, I have someone who
can retrieve them for me.

1226
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:23,565
- Brandon, I don't think he's
gonna be any help to you.

1227
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,668
He told me everything.

1228
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:28,970
So either you're gonna kill
me or you're gonna hand

1229
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,305
over my sister and I'll
give you the backup files

1230
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,275
with the encryption
key to the server.

1231
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,043
- All right, look, I'm
gonna count to three.

1232
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,512
If you don't hand me that computer

1233
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:39,881
by then I'm gonna shoot
you and your sister.

1234
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,882
One!

1235
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,050
Come on, two!

1236
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,053
Three!

1237
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,129
- Let go of my sister.

1238
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,487
- You bitches!

1239
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:40,409
- Colonel!

1240
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,343
- What happened to you?

1241
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:42,177
- It's a long story.

1242
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,812
She needs a medic.

1243
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,847
- Get a first aid kit.

1244
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,548
Here, sit down.

1245
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:47,616
Now, hold on a second.

1246
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:48,817
If there's something you need to

1247
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,052
tell me now is the time to do it.

1248
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,052
- You guys, I have something here.

1249
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:56,157
This dome is roughly
2500 cubic yards wide.

1250
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,292
It's 200 feet below the
surface, but look at this.

1251
01:14:58,293 --> 01:14:59,795
- Smaller and
stronger every minute.

1252
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:02,364
- We have an hour at best
before this volcano erupts.

1253
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,901
- Please tell me you
have a venting scenario.

1254
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,302
- Wait, wait, venting?

1255
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,403
I thought we were
preparing for a cold cap?

1256
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:10,205
I have to evacuate the base.

1257
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,807
- Wait, we're gonna
use the nitrogen,

1258
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,775
but only to direct the lava flow

1259
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:17,111
from the eruption to
here in the Miami Canal.

1260
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,313
- And the Miami Canal runs
into the Biscayne Bay.

1261
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,883
- Right, and we're gonna vent
the dome next to the canal.

1262
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,318
- And then the magma's gonna run

1263
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,920
down this canal like a lava tube.

1264
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,555
Fill up that bay.

1265
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:27,823
- There's only one problem.

1266
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,324
What?
- It's 200 feet

1267
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,226
beneath the surface and
we have no time to drill.

1268
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,661
- We don't have to.

1269
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:35,096
- Colonel, send your
company, send the trucks.

1270
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:38,366
Get all hands on deck to
1101 North River Drive.

1271
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,135
- I do not want to send 100
men on a suicide mission.

1272
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,571
Are you sure this
is the right call?

1273
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,505
- There's a well down there.

1274
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:44,673
- It's 150 feet deep.

1275
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,041
It's the only chance that we have.

1276
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,776
- Colonel, I have
never seen this man

1277
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:50,544
miscalculate mathematical
scientific equations.

1278
01:15:50,545 --> 01:15:53,948
I will take full responsibility
for his findings.

1279
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,450
- Okay, leave now.

1280
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,685
I'll be right behind you.
- Thank you, thank you, sir.

1281
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:58,685
- Sergeant, get some
Humvees available.

1282
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,991
I need an open channel.

1283
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,329
Attention
all companies and lieutenants.

1284
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,697
Your immediate orders
are to take all equipment

1285
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:14,068
and vehicles to 1101
North River Drive.

1286
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:17,138
I repeat, 1101 North River Drive.

1287
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:20,976
Company, move out.

1288
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,246
- All right, let's go.

1289
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,426
How did you know about this place?

1290
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:13,128
- I did the blueprint
design engineering.

1291
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,229
Ray would never tell me where
it was, but I figured it out.

1292
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,432
You're full of surprises.
- Follow me.

1293
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,842
Let's move.

1294
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,352
There's 20 pounds of C4
on the bottom of the well.

1295
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,860
400 canisters of LN2 on
the ground each rigged

1296
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,996
with its own C4 to blow two
seconds before we blow the well.

1297
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,066
And on the far wall
it's five pounds of C4

1298
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:54,136
to breach the well and detonate.

1299
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:57,673
- Okay, and the nitrogen's gonna

1300
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,907
coat the walls of the facility.

1301
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:01,275
- And the lava will flow
right into the canal.

1302
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,277
- So how are we gonna blow it?

1303
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:03,979
- Long range, half a mile.

1304
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,348
I'm looking for a signal now.

1305
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:10,483
Okay, let's go.

1306
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,991
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1307
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:36,945
- You okay?

1308
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,945
- Yeah, for now.

1309
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,822
- I'll meet you at
Olive and Third.

1310
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,822
- All right.

1311
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,383
- Take cover.

1312
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:16,818
- Are we at a safe distance?

1313
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,420
- I don't know,
we're gonna find out.

1314
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,420
- Three, two, one, detonate!

1315
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,592
- What happened?

1316
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,793
- It's not going off?

1317
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:25,594
- Damn it, I don't have a signal.

1318
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,062
We must be too far away.

1319
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:30,064
All right, folks, it's time
for us to save our skin.

1320
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,065
Move out.

1321
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,969
Brandon, I said move out!

1322
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,375
- I just need to take this
close enough to get a signal.

1323
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,912
Don't let them out of the car.

1324
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,652
- Deville, follow me!

1325
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:53,822
Drive.

1326
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,023
- Why are we leaving him?

1327
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:57,591
- He has to get
closer for a signal.

1328
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,592
He will be all right.

1329
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,642
Damn it!

1330
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:21,476
Okay.

1331
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:25,980
Okay.

1332
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,981
All right.

1333
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,023
Damn it.

1334
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,060
Damn.

1335
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,528
Come on!

1336
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:41,363
Come on!

1337
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:46,233
Shh.

1338
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,202
Damn!

1339
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:49,637
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1340
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:54,609
No!

1341
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,083
Of course.

1342
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,723
All right.

1343
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,164
Okay.

1344
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,665
- He dit it, and it's working.

1345
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,137
Mission accomplished, all
personnel return to base.

1346
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,806
I repeat, mission accomplished.

1347
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,243
All personnel return to base.

1348
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,020
- One year ago, Miami
averted annihilation thanks

1349
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,689
to the brilliant mind of
Dr. Antoinette Vitrini.

1350
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,958
- You're a celebrity.

1351
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,958
- Yeah, I think we
need to get away.

1352
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:53,762
- Where are you thinking?

1353
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,697
- I don't know, somewhere cold.

1354
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,098
- North Pole.

1355
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,533
- No, that's too cold.

1356
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,868
- Alaska?

1357
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,336
Yes, that sounds good.
- Okay.

1358
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,538
Will be standing by
to bring you the very latest.

1359
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:09,544
John, back to you.
