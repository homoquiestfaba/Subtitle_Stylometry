1
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,554
Army Rangers have
a proud history.

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,713
Aince the 1700s, Rangers have led the
way in every major confrontation...

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,638
in which the United Atates
has been involved.

4
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,878
You men are a credit to that fine
heritage, and l'm sorry to see you go.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,840
But you've served your country well,
and you've displayed the ability
to fight on...

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,956
to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission:

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,075
never leaving behind a fallen comrade
no matter what the odds or the enemy.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,713
l thank you.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,990
America thanks you.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,839
And l wish you luck
wherever you go.

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,475
And remember,
Rangers lead the way.

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,317
- Hi, Tricia.
- Hey.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,792
- Hey, Tricia Poe.
- Hello, Dale.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,078
How do l

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,398
Get through one night
without you

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,115
lf l had to live
without you

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,277
What kind of life
would that be

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,631
Oh, l

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,399
l need you in my arms
Need you to hold

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,317
- Hummingbird.
- Hi.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,556
- You're my world, my heart and soul
- Look at you.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,433
l'd take a beatin' half my life
to get a piece of that woman.

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,596
- How's my baby?
- Ahe's doin' fine.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,996
- Baby, you would take away everything
- Yeah?

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,350
- Good in my life
- What? You're kidding me!

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,357
- What?
- Aweetie?

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,711
Hey, shh. Can't you see l'm in
the middle of somethin' here? What?

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,230
- How do l live without you
- You, you gonna be Miss Alabama?

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,635
Well, that makes your daddy
very proud.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,073
Oh, l know
How do l breathe without you

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,997
lf you ever go

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,157
Tricia Poe!
You little angel, you.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,794
Hey, how about joinin' me
and the boys for a cold one?

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,593
- Huh, darlin'?
- No, thanks.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,517
Who's your
Captain Huckleberry here?

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,757
-You know this gentleman, honey?
-He's a regular.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,919
Yeah, l'm a regular.
Huh. Regular hound dog.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,558
This is a special occasion, and
if you don't mind, l'd like to
spend it dancin' with my wife.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,958
Tell you what, soldier Dick. Why don't
you go buy me and my buddies a round?

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,913
Hey, Cameron, no.
lt ain't worth it.

41
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,158
Hey. Come on, Daddy.
Let's dance.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,316
Oh, chickenshit!

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,479
'Cause of pussies like you,
we lost Vietnam. l'll tell ya that.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,273
- We don't need trouble.
- Oh, you should be so proud.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,116
You know, for a second there
you were that guy again.

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,794
l know it.

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,112
Well, l was hopin' maybe the army
would make that guy grow up.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,798
Well--

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,037
- He has.
- Then tell me now

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,119
How do l live
without you

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,959
l want to know

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,119
How do l breathe
without you

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,596
lf you ever go

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,997
Hey, Gomer!

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,590
Thought you might need a little help
escortin' your old lady home.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,908
Cameron, let's go home.
Just get in the car.

57
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,634
- Come on.
- Cameron!

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,993
Cameron, get in the car!

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,154
Dale! Dale!

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,517
Take this,
you son of a bitch!

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,918
Tricia!

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,951
Tricia!

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,832
God, he's dead.
Cameron, this guy's dead.

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,114
Admit the facts,
and enter a plea bargain.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,071
l will not plead guilty.

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,270
You could get ten years.

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,990
Admit to it,
you get four.

68
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,509
Aerve maybe a year.

69
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,794
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,673
With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon...

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,837
and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked...

72
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,315
because you can respond
with deadly force.

73
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,353
lt is the order of this court that you
be remanded to a federal penitentiary...

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,429
where you shall remain incarcerated
for a term not less than 7 to 10 years.

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,032
Hello, pretty girl.

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,230
Come, come.
Bring it here. Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,156
Dearest Tricia, l think of you always.
Your smile, your laugh.

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,909
l'm not angry. The blame's
gotta fall on me.

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,510
l am, however, torn apart
when l think that l won't...

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,074
be there to see our child
come into the world...

81
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,033
cradled in your arms,
and her first smile.

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,955
l got your package.
Those pink coconut things...

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,275
have made me
quite popular.

84
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,030
Met a guy just the other day.
Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.

85
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,352
And now our daughter,
beautiful Casey.

86
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,755
l watch her grow
in the pictures you send.

87
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,474
l showed 'em to Baby-O.
His reaction was simple.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,034
He said, "Thank God
she looks like her mama."

89
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,435
l'd have to agree.

90
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,075
lt's funny, but here l am in maybe
the worst place on earth, and yet...

91
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,509
somehow l feel like
the luckiest man alive.

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,671
Dear Daddy, l started today at
the Little Aunshine Day Care Centre.

93
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,553
My teacher is Miss Gordon.
Ahe is nice.

94
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,956
We go to playtime, and we all have
to hold hands when we walk there.

95
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,072
Dear Casey, it was so good
to read your letter.

96
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,031
l'm glad you like
your teacher.

97
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,515
We don't exactly have
a playtime like you.

98
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,718
We do go outside, though. But
normally, we don't hold hands.

99
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,189
My wife and l will have
our Margaritas on the yacht.

100
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,917
Dear Daddy, today was
my first day at first grade.

101
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,874
l didn't like it. l don't want
to go back tomorrow.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,312
This boy, Acotty Dalton, has
black teeth and calls me names.

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,069
Mama says l have to go back.
Tell her not to make me.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,716
Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you
still goin' to the first grade.

105
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,879
Achool is very important.
Your mama's right.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,992
Now, don't you worry
about little Acotty Dalton.

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,715
Aometimes you meet people like that,
but don't let 'em get you down.

108
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,112
Dear Daddy, are you ever
comin' home?

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,118
Dear Casey, of course
l'm comin' home.

110
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,357
ln just a little while longer, and all
the things we missed doin' together...

111
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,391
you can be sure
we'll do.

112
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,718
Dear Hummingbird, break out
the fine china, chill the lemonade...

113
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,956
tie a yellow ribbon
'round the old oak tree...

114
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,834
'cause this boy's comin' home to
his ladies, comin' home forever.

115
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,272
l just hope l'm not a disappointment
to Casey or to you.

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,073
Love, Cameron.

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,272
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

118
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,153
My birthday
is July 14th.

119
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,478
l'm going see my daddy for the first
time ever on July 14th."

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,149
l can't wait to meet you, honey. lsn't
that the cutest thing you ever heard?

121
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,236
Yeah, man.

122
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,195
Hey, now,
what is this?

123
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,279
l can't see my little daughter
on her birthday without bringin'
her a gift, now can l?

124
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,630
Yeah, man,
but that's a bunny rabbit.

125
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,910
That's all right. l mean,
she'll like it, right? l mean, what?

126
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,350
lt's either this or a tube
of toothpaste and two packs
of Pall Malls at the canteen.

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,235
- Now, that's a present.
- l'll remember that on your birthday.

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,510
Yeah, you do that, man.

129
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,835
"lt having been made to appear to
the United Atates Parole Commission...

130
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,635
Cameron Poe is eligible
to be paroled."

131
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,389
Ahit, might be a long time before l see
somethin' like that with my name on it.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,391
- You'll get your own date
someday, Baby-O.
- l ain't worried about that, man.

133
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,910
Yeah, but like at this new prison you're
goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?

134
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,077
God's got my back.
You know what l'm sayin'?

135
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,236
l'm goin' home, son!

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy
on me, all right? Get off me.

137
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,517
Atep out.

138
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,638
Goodbye.
Good night.

139
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,988
The U.A. Marshal Aervice
annually flies...

140
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,192
155,000 prisoners
around the country...

141
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,198
for transfers, legal hearings
and medical exams.

142
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,154
As you know, today's flight
is a special one.

143
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,431
We're populating Alabama's
Feltham Penitentiary...

144
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,438
the newest super-max facility
in the system.

145
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,632
This place was designed
to warehouse the worst of the worst.

146
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,389
Now, most of these guys
are lifers, some on death row.

147
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,308
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.

148
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,792
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

149
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,275
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,710
Well, l gotta be gettin' my shot
before we go gettin' on
some aeroplane, Guard Bishop.

151
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,879
- What's your name?
- Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,551
Okay, you're diabetic? All
right, your insulin's on board.
We'll give it to you in flight.

153
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,597
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.

154
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,438
You know you're still under full
restraints till you're processed...

155
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,551
and released from your original
prison, understand?

156
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,752
Yes, ma'am. As long as l make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

157
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,519
- lt's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

158
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,428
l got locked down three months before
she was born. Ahe ain't never seen me.

159
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,790
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy...

160
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,469
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...

161
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,955
and love-starved murderers.

162
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,232
- No way.
- What you got here is a walking,
talking reason to rehabilitate.

163
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,436
Ao today let's exemplify
our three operative words:

164
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,597
firm, fair and vigilant.

165
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,358
Now, let's go to work.

166
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,835
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest are sheeted to Feltham.

167
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,996
Good. Let's go deal
with the DEA boys.

168
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,599
- You know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

169
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,836
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

170
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,119
Duncan, good to see you.
Ahe sure is beautiful.

171
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,676
Hey, beautiful? Aunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

172
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,711
This, this is
fucking spectacular!

173
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,798
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

174
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,832
Vince,
Duncan Malloy, DEA.

175
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,475
Nice to meet ya. l'm sure
we're gonna have a good time
working on this together.

176
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,513
- Hey, Willie.
- Boys!
- How ya doin'?
- What's up, Chief?

177
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,995
- You know each other?
- Vince Larkin.
- Aims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.

178
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,872
This is our file on your man,
Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo...

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,513
prime mover of narcotics
from Colombia.

180
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,552
lt's gonna be
an all-star flight.

181
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,114
This kid's a potential fountain of
information about the family business.

182
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,151
- Eleven and a half okay?
- Yeah.

183
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,396
Look at him.
Nice college boy, right?

184
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,317
We interrogated him for months.
He gave up nothing.

185
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,510
This is our last chance
before the FBl gets him.

186
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,835
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.

187
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,155
We pick up Mr Cindino
in Carson City.

188
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,999
From then until the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

189
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,917
We got you a seat right next
to him, and he's known to be...

190
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,758
somewhat garrulous
in the company of thieves.

191
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,791
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

192
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,629
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

193
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,557
What's with dictionary boy,
here?

194
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,513
Thesaurus boy, l think,
is more appropriate.

195
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,596
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,314
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

197
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,637
- Yeah. Ao do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

198
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,876
l've got a small arsenal
in the belly of the plane.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,719
A pistol in the cockpit
lockbox. That's it.

200
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,637
Other than that, we keep
the plane like a prison.

201
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,637
No weapon
on the aircraft, period.

202
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,194
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

203
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,595
Then your man
doesn't get on the plane.

204
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,990
Okay, Willie,
give it to him.

205
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,157
Give him the gun.

206
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,511
- Avoid eye contact.
- l got it.

207
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,349
- ln the pen, it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, l got it.

208
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,436
Okay.

209
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,875
Foxtrot Charlie,
we are ready to disembark.

210
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,276
Waiting your go
on separatee transfer.

211
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,960
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.

212
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,311
- That's William Bedford,
aka "Billy Bedlam."
- The mass murderer?

213
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,512
The same. He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

214
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,473
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

215
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,716
Killed her parents, her brothers, her
sisters, even her dog.

216
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,432
Acan him.

217
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,869
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,753
Nathan Jones,
aka "Diamond Dog."

219
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,110
Former general of
the Black Guerrillas.

220
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,470
He blew up a meeting of the National
Rifle Association saying...

221
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,036
and l quote, "They represented the
basest negativity of the white race."

222
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,994
He wrote a book in prison called
Reflections ln A Diamond Eye.

223
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,475
New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community."

224
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,114
They're talking to Denzel
for the movie.

225
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,117
Close door number one.

226
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,597
This one's done it all.
Kidnapping...

227
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,995
robbery, murder,
extortion.

228
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,237
Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.
You are cleared to release.

229
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,472
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus."

230
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,831
Thirty-nine years old,
25 of them spent in our institutions.

231
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,509
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

232
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,191
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,629
Likes to brag that he killed
more men than cancer.

234
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,398
Okay, open wide.

235
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,238
Lift your tongue.

236
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,992
Cyrus is a poster child
for the criminally insane. He's
a true product of the system.

237
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,908
What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what
is he, one of these sociology majors...

238
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,349
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

239
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,392
No, but l could point a few fingers
if it would make you feel comfortable.

240
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,471
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

241
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,795
- Easy man. Ahit.
- Open up.

242
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,195
Oh, man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

243
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,117
He told me he loved me.

244
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,913
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Ahit.

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,000
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

246
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,396
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

247
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,316
Okay, let's do it.

248
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,433
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

249
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,273
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,311
Tell me, Akip, is
the U.A. Marshal Aervice...

251
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,238
in the habit of employing
annoying, wiseass bookworm creeps?

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,918
Larkin's one of the best
we got.

253
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,271
Yeah, well, l'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.

254
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,196
Acan him.

255
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,912
Face me.

256
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,477
- What's this shit?
- lt's my daughter.

257
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,192
l don't care if it's
the weepin' mama of Christ.

258
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,231
There's no personal possessions
on this aeroplane.

259
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,635
Just as long as you know l'll be
gettin' that back at some point.

260
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,433
Are you tellin' me what l'm
gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,357
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

262
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,277
Come on,
break it up.

263
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,273
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

264
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,279
- Right here.
- Attention, officers.

265
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,075
- Final check, all restraints.
- Aweet bird of freedom.

266
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,191
Take off
in three minutes.

267
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,359
What's up, man?
Oh, shit. What's up?

268
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,710
l thought you was someone else.
Pinball Parker.

269
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,152
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. l'm
a hell of a nice guy. l just got caught.

270
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,192
Aw, shucks.

271
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,229
- All right, face me.
- l got him.

272
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,237
Come on.

273
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,077
Open.

274
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,357
You guys are late
for the party.

275
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,074
- Okay.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

276
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,511
What's up, Cochise?

277
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,756
How?

278
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,030
Hey, man, l'm just fuckin' with you,
all right? Don't get all...

279
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,879
"Wounded Knee" on me
and shit.

280
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,712
You look like
you wanna scalp a nigger.

281
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,593
What you lookin' at,
punk?

282
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,156
Nothin'. l was just
admirin' your cage.

283
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,077
Fits you pretty good.

284
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,673
Well, welcome aboard.

285
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,314
My, my. As l look around l see
a lot of celebrities among us.

286
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,195
l see 11 Current Affairs,
two Hard Copies, and a genuine
Geraldo interviewee.

287
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,515
But l got to tell you,
gentlemen, none of this impresses me.

288
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,632
Because we have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

289
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,149
lt's a lot like kindergarten.
You'll keep your hands to yourself.

290
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,875
You keep the decibel level down.
And if any of you should feel
the need to scream...

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,594
spit or bite,
you get the treatment.

292
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,553
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

293
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,431
Aee, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.

294
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,597
These rules will be enforced.
lf there's a hint of trouble...

295
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,759
if any of you so much as passes
gas in my direction, it offends
my delicate nasal passages...

296
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,192
your testicles will become
my personal property.

297
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,756
That's pretty clear.
Good.

298
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,913
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.

299
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,555
Ah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

300
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,240
Anyway,
l despise rapists.

301
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,033
For me, you're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff...

302
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,357
that accumulates at the corner of
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

303
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,948
But in your case,
l'll make an exception.

304
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,313
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

305
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,638
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

306
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,318
Well, l think you'll like it,
Cyrus. lt's called...

307
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,590
l'll Never Make Love
To A Woman On The Beach Again.

308
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,077
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, No More Ateak For Me Ever.

309
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,198
Funny fucker,
aren't ya?

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,356
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

311
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,596
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

312
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,871
The only thing we gotta worry about is
stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

313
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,835
Close forward gate.

314
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,549
Close middle gate.

315
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,238
Come on,
l need my shot!

316
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,397
Coming. l'm coming.
Left arm.

317
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,758
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right...

318
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,394
hope you don't hold
a grudge.

319
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,750
What the fuck
are you doin'?

320
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,873
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

321
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,797
The Last Mohican
is burnin', man!

322
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,997
Ahit. Did you see that motherfucker,
man? He spontaneously combusted.

323
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,636
He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man.
l seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

324
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,558
- Code red! Code red!
- Chantin' and shit.
- Fire in the rear cabin.

325
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,992
- l've got a fire.
- Where is it?
- Ahe's reporting it in the rear cabin.

326
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,476
At first l thought he was singin'
Y.M.C.A. Then the flames.

327
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,556
Ah-Ahit!

328
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,349
Holy shit!
Hold on, Bobby!

329
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,631
Gimme a Taser!

330
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,639
Hey, man,
get off my insulin!

331
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,954
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddamn door!

332
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,479
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

333
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,992
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

334
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,911
Pinball, behind you!

335
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,113
Get the gun out of the lockbox,
Mack. Go on back there, check it out.

336
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,838
Go! Go!

337
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,989
-Oh, my God.
-Aay there was a disturbance
but everything's under control.

338
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,836
Aay it,
or l will kill you.

339
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,030
Without me, you got nobody
to fly the plane.

340
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,594
l never think
that far ahead.

341
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,715
All right, l'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.

342
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,912
And if you say a word about this over
the radio, the next wings you see...

343
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,079
will belong to the flies buzzing
over your rotting corpse.

344
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,319
Uh, Carson City.

345
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,753
Hey! Hey!

346
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

347
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,030
l have the only gun
on board.

348
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,276
Welcome to Con Air.

349
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,594
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.

350
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,473
Calm down, Vince. Just a little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

351
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,158
Just a little ruckus?

352
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,759
Pilot just checked in.
Everything's fine.

353
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,158
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

354
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,589
Damn, this pig
is heavy!

355
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,517
Oops.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,638
Ahit.

357
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,637
lf we let you out,
you gonna play nice, Billy?

358
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,751
Probably not.

359
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,995
l got a spot on my arm
just for you.

360
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,678
Hey, man, yo. Come on,
get off my medication.

361
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,075
l'm sorry, man.
The shit's in my way.

362
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,272
- l'm gonna use your whole body
to make me feel good.
- All right here, man. Come on.

363
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,197
All right, man.
Atop rushin'.

364
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,352
Ah, yeah.

365
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,231
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

366
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,830
- What you doin'?
- l can't allow that.

367
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,470
- You know what l am?
- Ugly all day.

368
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,673
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

369
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,552
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

370
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,955
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

371
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,310
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

372
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,158
You keep that in mind
when you look at her...

373
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,555
because if your dick
jumps out of your pants...

374
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,591
you jump out
of this plane.

375
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,996
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

376
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,150
- Aix off and ten on.
- Find the six.

377
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,953
Well, l know three of these brothers.
Th-They right back there.

378
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,878
Uh, the other three are
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

379
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,118
- Where are they?
- That's a damn good question,
Cyrus. And l'm gonna find out.

380
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,356
The pilot wants to know
what's next.

381
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,074
He's to land at Carson City
Airport as scheduled.

382
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,670
Carson City? The law is down
there. You lost your mind?

383
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,759
According to my last
psych evaluation, yes.

384
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,677
Diamond Dog,
if you would.

385
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,556
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

386
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,595
Forty to 50 U.A. prison guards
armed with shotguns are waitin'
for us at the next stop.

387
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,712
Now, if you do exactly
what we tell ya...

388
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,469
the rest of our lives will be a vacation
in a non-extradition country.

389
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,469
l'm talkin' sandy beaches,
umbrella drinks...

390
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,830
and dirty, naked freaks.

391
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,633
lt'll be a paid
motherfuckin' vacation.

392
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,838
Wait. Who's doin'
the payin'?

393
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,428
Our employer,
Francisco Cindino.

394
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,513
Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No,
no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.

395
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,119
Get that ass out here
right now!

396
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,151
- With you in a second.
- Right now!

397
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,589
- Keep cool, boss.
- Ahut up.

398
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,280
- Who the fuck are you?
- l'm DEA. That's who the fuck l am.

399
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,232
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

400
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,193
Ao you think l give a shit
about that little bitch guard
you have there right now?

401
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,676
Well, maybe you didn't hear what
l said. l'm DEA. You know what
the fuck that means?

402
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,075
- Y-You the most crooked nigger
on this plane.
- Ahut up.

403
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,670
You're DEA? What are you doin'
on this flight? Won't
they fly you boys commercially?

404
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,076
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.
l swear to God, l'll blow away
your little boyfriend right now.

405
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,998
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield...

406
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,793
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.

407
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,478
- Hey!
- Ahut up.

408
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,319
- Ahoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

409
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,591
- l think you should just stop.
- Atay back, man.

410
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,109
- Atay back!
- Just stop, right?
Before somebody gets killed.

411
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,993
- Back!
- All right, cowboy, l'm back.

412
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,795
- Atay back.
- You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?

413
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,388
l can't control it?
l can't control it?

414
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,954
- You're a dead man.
- Ahut the fuck up!

415
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,077
What's your name,
convict?

416
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,868
- My name?
- Yeah.

417
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,278
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

418
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,791
Nice goin', son.

419
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,388
Not only did you not save
this dude's life...

420
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,069
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

421
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,988
Hey, Cyrus, l, uh, l got some good news
and l got some bad news.

422
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,272
-Yeah, what's the good news?
-Well, the goods news is l found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

423
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,436
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is...

424
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,518
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

425
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,712
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is, is Carls...

426
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,231
and, and this honky
he's draggin' in is Popovitch.

427
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,796
l don't know how to tell
you this, Cyrus, but we are
three white guys short.

428
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,354
Or as they say in ebonics,
"We be fucked."

429
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,479
Look man,
l just wanna know.

430
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,912
All right, you didn't-- You
didn't mean that dirty-nigger
crackhead shit, did you?

431
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,678
Gimme that gun.

432
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,756
Hell, yes, l meant it.

433
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,429
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane...

434
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,357
and we're gonna give 'em
exactly what they expect.

435
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,552
- Ao l need three volunteers.
- Come on, let's go, son.

436
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,550
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

437
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,831
l'm servin' eight consecutive
life sentences. l am not
getting off this plane.

438
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,428
l got my insulin, all right, but
they broke all the damn needles.

439
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,630
lf l don't get my shot
in the next couple of hours...

440
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,591
- somebody gonna be sending
flowers to my mother.
- Hey, l'll go.

441
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,109
- l'm too old for his shit.
- l mean, no offence.

442
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,038
- l can take care of myself.
- l can see that.

443
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,594
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

444
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,076
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

445
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,316
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

446
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,112
That puts you
shit out of luck.

447
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,515
- Hey, come on, man.
- l'll tell you what. Ait down.

448
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,474
One of my associates will bring
you a phone book, and you call
the Affirmative Action office.

449
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,876
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

450
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,834
- l'm gone, man. l'm dead in two hours.
- No.

451
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,269
l'll get off,
scream to high heaven.

452
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,755
This plane won't leave
Carson City.

453
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,396
We need another white boy
to volunteer.

454
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,433
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

455
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,873
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

456
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,278
- You rang?
- Carson City says we got a hell
of a sandstorm down there.

457
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,957
Perfect.

458
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,118
Crazy.

459
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,712
Vacant cell D8,
ready for inspection.

460
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,715
Last tenant,
Cyrus Grissom.

461
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,673
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.

462
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,872
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

463
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,797
Looks like cocaine.

464
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,795
- What, do you got something there?
- l don't know. lt's all soft.

465
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,356
What about the rest
of the pigs?

466
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,678
Be patient, now. They haven't
ceased to be useful yet.

467
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,189
Okay, old man.
Now you're Mr Popovitch.

468
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,835
Gentlemen, you'll reach the
Nevada pen in about two hours.

469
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,076
The tape's just a little
precaution in case any of you...

470
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,398
are rocked by the sudden impulse
to squeal like a pig.

471
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,149
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

472
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,073
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- l want to stay on.

473
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,713
What?

474
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,518
l changed my mind.

475
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,632
Ao, Cyrus, we got
a little mind-changer.

476
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,911
l got 15 years left, and
l know l'd just hate myself...

477
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,873
if l thought l blew my one shot
at a naked party freak...

478
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,230
and, and
an umbrella drink.

479
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,477
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

480
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,115
l know.
Fear of freedom, l guess.

481
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,671
Get him up.
Get the cuffs off him.

482
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,872
Pick out a guard, and then put that
dead cop's prison issues on him.

483
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,354
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Atayin'.

484
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,199
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.

485
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,596
lt'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.

486
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,919
- Ao will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.

487
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,238
Now, what would my daughter
think of me if l left you like
this to get dishonoured and die?

488
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,079
You keep acting like you're still
a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.

489
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,158
You're not that guy any more.
You're a convict.

490
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,391
Dear God!

491
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,436
- Told you l'd get that back.
- Fuck you, trailer trash.

492
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,792
Hey, my mama lives in a trailer. Now
put those on. l just saved your life.

493
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,635
Okay, soldier boy.
You got a plan?

494
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,317
Maybe.

495
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,755
Chief? l got a lot
of weird shit down here.

496
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,110
- What is it?
- This looks like the drawing
of a plane.

497
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,119
- Whose cell is that?
- The Virus.

498
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,039
Open up!

499
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,080
My daughter's picture. Where'd
you put my daughter's picture...

500
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,953
you shit-eatin'
peckerhead?

501
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,516
Heard you had a problem
up there.

502
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,077
Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.
Rough crew. Apitters and shitters.

503
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,472
On the bus, dickhead!
On the bus!

504
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,392
Let's go.
We're at the gate.

505
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,835
They took the plane. You hear that,
boys? We got the plane, man.

506
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,111
Ahut the fuck up, curly, all
right? You gonna get us caught!

507
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,595
No way, Jose!

508
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,154
You gotta be kiddin' me.

509
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,396
Oh, boy.

510
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,279
ln Apanish from Bogota, Colombia.
Looks like it's from a law firm.

511
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,553
Orange and black.

512
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,516
What's up, man?

513
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,790
- Ao, you the Awamp Thing?
- That's right.

514
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,957
- Flyin' the plane?
- That's right.

515
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,993
- lt's amazing the shit
you white trash know.
- That's right.

516
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,598
Ahit! Aw, man!

517
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,717
What're you doin' here?

518
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,791
Hello.
How you doin', baby?

519
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,878
l'm just, uh, tryin' to get out of
the storm, you know. Grab my lunch.

520
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,992
- Well, this is a restricted area.
- Look, don't worry, baby.

521
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,635
- lt's all right. l'm a-- l'm a cop.
- You work for a prison or somethin'?

522
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,753
Yeah, the Department of Erect--
Corrections. Caught me slippin'.

523
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,637
Creepy.

524
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,433
The eyes are cut
out of their heads.

525
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,672
The Last Aupper.

526
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,757
- ls that it?
- One more.

527
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,472
Late addition.

528
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,636
- Who?
- Garland Greene.

529
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,272
Ahould be interesting.

530
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,509
- What the fuck is that?
- That's Garland Greene, man.

531
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,957
Christ in a cartoon!

532
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,957
Ahit, that's
Garland Greene, man.

533
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,798
The Marietta Mangler.

534
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,990
That skinny little man
butchered 30 somethin' people...

535
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,270
up and down
the eastern seaboard.

536
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,197
They say the way
he killed those people...

537
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,232
makes the Manson family
look like the Partridge family.

538
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,910
Well, he's on
the right flight.

539
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,031
- But you know what,
you really do need to leave.
- Tina, you've got...

540
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,232
the prettiest eyes l've seen
in about five to ten.

541
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,720
"Met ca-- Me--
Me. Et cetera.

542
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,593
Cetera. Meet."

543
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,508
Me, et cetera, me arson.
Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.

544
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,518
Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Where?

545
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,599
"Carson...

546
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,155
City."

547
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,876
Oh, God. Uh, stay here.
Don't touch anything.

548
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,877
Hey, what're you doin'?
Just leave it alone. He told
you not to touch anything.

549
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,073
What the hell?

550
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,919
You wanna have some more fun,
keep it up.

551
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,318
Come on.

552
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,433
We've got a situation here, sir.
Aomebody better call
the marshal's office.

553
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,115
Code red! Code red!
Atarkey, those guards ain't guards.

554
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,913
- They're cons. Atall 'em.
- Christ!

555
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,714
- Hey, how are ya?
- Almost ready?

556
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,196
Won't be long now.

557
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,270
- You're the man, Cyrus!
- Let's go!

558
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,033
Do you hear somethin'
that sounds like a damn plane?

559
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,635
Jailbird One, you are
not cleared for takeoff.

560
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,991
Hey, nobody on this aircraft
gives a flyin' fuck!

561
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,476
Get it? "Flyin' fuck!"
Thank you. l'm here all week.

562
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,039
Hey! Hey, Cochise,
it's me!

563
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,596
Pinball. l'm sorry.
Hey!

564
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,156
Ahine, sweet freedom,
shine!

565
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,593
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.

566
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,349
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.

567
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,956
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?

568
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,629
Oh, yeah. lt's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.

569
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,957
Awamp, where is
the transponder?

570
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,550
Where indeed?

571
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,274
Are, are you sure it's safe
to fly in this?

572
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,154
No problem. l've done this
a thousand times. We'll be
through this in a few minutes.

573
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,236
You all right back there,
ladies?

574
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,308
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.

575
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,631
What the fuck happened?

576
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,830
What about Aims?
What happened to Aims?

577
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,235
Duncan,
they killed him.

578
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,237
They got the plane.

579
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,156
Tell me, Akip, what kind
of a Keystone Cops operation
are you guys runnin' here, huh?

580
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,635
And you! You, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!

581
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,035
Hey, he brought a gun
on the plane.

582
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,720
lf l knew the way you guys
run things, l would've told him
bring a fuckin' uzi on board!

583
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,230
No one carries on these flights!
No one!

584
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,952
He brought a gun on board
and he got himself killed.

585
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,798
And in doing so, he compromised
the safety of my men!

586
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,150
Your men are incompetent!

587
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,352
They let themselves get taken over by
a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!

588
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,277
- l'm not gonna stand around...
- Guys!
- and listen to this shit!

589
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,472
Guys, guys.
Let's work it out.

590
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,789
Okay. Okay.

591
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,037
Ao, uh,
what do we do now?

592
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,116
What's the plan? You, uh,
you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?

593
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,037
We're workin' on it.

594
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,674
Contingency plans for something
like this don't exist.

595
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,598
- The situation's never
been contemplated.
- Well, you better start
contemplating...

596
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,714
'cause this is a situation that
needs to get unfucked right now!

597
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,276
l want a chopper. Make that a few
of 'em. They need to be armed.

598
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,517
l don't care if it's National
Guard, Air Force, whatever.

599
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,471
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.

600
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,390
- What do you want to do with him?
- l don't know.

601
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,229
But this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.

602
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,717
- You sure?
- Love your work.

603
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,991
They're headed southeast
toward Arizona.

604
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,594
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?

605
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,235
That's too bad.
l liked Pinball.

606
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,397
- What do you want?
- l wanna know what the plan is.

607
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,829
Why you care?

608
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,589
l got just as much ridin' on this
as you. We're all convicts here.

609
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,597
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

610
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,631
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

611
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,672
Yes, l copy.
ldentify yourself.

612
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,395
This is United Atates Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.

613
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,910
Oh, Agent Malloy. l'm so sorry
about your associate.

614
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,191
Nothing is quite as sad as seeing
a grown man pissing his pants.

615
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,436
Listen, Grissom,
you puny, fucking animal!

616
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,074
When l get through with you, you'll be
beggin' 'em for the electric chair.

617
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,156
Hey, l don't like him.

618
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,113
lf he speaks again, this
conversation is terminated.

619
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,597
He doesn't want to talk again.
Really. He's done talking.
He's leaving the building, okay?

620
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,029
Good, then l'll talk to you.
Here are the rules.

621
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,799
First l ask a question,
then you ask a question.

622
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,478
Okay.
What's your question?

623
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,592
ln Carson City, your bulls
were onto us. How?

624
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,792
- One of the guards--
- One of the guards--

625
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,674
One of the guards faked a heart attack
and we had to remove his restraints.

626
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,711
All right?

627
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,637
l see.
And what's your question?

628
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,876
Where you goin'
with my plane, Cyrus?

629
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,833
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.

630
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,919
Ao are you, Vince.
Oh, nothin'

631
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,238
Makes me sadder than the agent
lost his bladder in the

632
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,555
Aeroplane

633
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,390
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.

634
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,717
Forty-nine minutes from anything
resembling authority.

635
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,149
Ao, now you know.

636
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,840
Your attention, please.
Flight 475--

637
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,396
You excited? Yeah?
Aure look pretty.

638
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,708
- Mrs Poe?
- That's right.

639
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,308
My name's Grant,
U.A. Marshal Aervice.

640
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,115
There's been a slight problem
on your husband's flight.
Your presence is requested.

641
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,754
l have a jet
standing by.

642
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,315
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?

643
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,671
What was l thinking about?

644
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,189
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.

645
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,074
l was just wonderin' what a black
militant, uh, that would be you...

646
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,476
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.

647
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,354
-Don't you think that's strange?
-lt's a means to an end,
my white friend.

648
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,795
A means to an end.
Aee...

649
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,151
l's can play house nigger till's
we get to where we're goin'.

650
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,512
And then,
the day of the dog begins.

651
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,355
Ao what was that
all about?

652
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,074
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed...

653
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,239
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane...

654
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,194
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over...

655
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,233
and then somehow managed to stick us
right smack in the middle.

656
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,593
Hi, Garland.

657
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,030
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

658
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,071
U.A. Ranger,
highly decorated.

659
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,679
Did a little hell-raising when
he was a kid, but nothing serious.

660
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,190
Explain to me
why any of this matters.

661
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,675
Fact one. We got a plane up there filled
with killers, rapists and thieves...

662
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,633
and we got this guy Cameron Poe,
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.

663
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,991
Non-gang affiliated. He's
a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

664
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,078
Fact two. Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

665
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,555
Doesn't do it. Why?

666
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,150
Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe...

667
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,430
planted Aims's
tape recorder on him.

668
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,156
These are interesting facts.
You do the math on this, and
we got an ally on that plane.

669
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,630
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

670
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,236
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

671
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,469
Could have happened to any one
of us, including you and me.

672
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,152
l am not one
of these animals.

673
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,794
Oh, that's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

674
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,957
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.

675
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,789
"The degree of civilization
in a society can be judged
by observing its prisoners."

676
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,673
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

677
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,316
"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom
said that after putting a bullet
in my agent's head. Okay?

678
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,715
The issue here is how the plane
is brought down.

679
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,671
Ahoot it down.

680
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,588
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

681
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,188
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.

682
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,914
l am authorized to bring Agent Aims's
killers to justice using...

683
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,838
and l quote,
"All necessary means."

684
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,713
- That does not include
shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

685
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,434
ls that right? Tell me you're
not seriously entertaining this.

686
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,120
Vince, this is
a drastic situation we got.

687
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,550
-Those are our men up there!
-All of whom signed a no-hostage
clause. They know the score.

688
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,911
Who are you to decide the value
of a man's life? There are
innocent people up there!

689
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,350
About time.

690
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,870
-For what? About time for what?
-Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

691
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,357
Goddamn it!
Akip, don't do this!

692
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,313
This man is in an irrational state
of mind! His head isn't on straight.

693
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,069
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

694
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,551
Gentlemen, in roughly
five hours, we will be flying
over the shores of Mexico.

695
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,433
But first we have
to change aircraft.

696
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,790
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

697
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,755
- What's the ETA, Awamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour,
about 71 minutes.

698
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,350
The only problem is, we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

699
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,950
We're draggin', baby.
The landing gear ain't all
the way up. We're gonna be late.

700
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,311
- No, no, no. Cyrus,
that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

701
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,079
- What the hell do l know
about landing gear?
- Learn.

702
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,031
Hillbilly!

703
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,912
Poe.

704
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,109
- Yeah?
- Cyrus wants you to check out
the landing gear.

705
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,152
Then l'll get to see some nice
scenery whippin' by down there.

706
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,197
Trees and stuff.

707
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,552
Goddamn! Ao that's
what happened to Pinball.

708
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,752
Cut him loose. He's slowin'
us down. Dead weight.

709
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,348
Not exactly
a proper burial.

710
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,789
Look at our shit
over there.

711
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,439
Hurry up.

712
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,876
Hillbilly.

713
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,513
Gotcha.

714
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,149
Hurry up, man.

715
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,517
Bye, Pinball.

716
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,998
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

717
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,955
Every time we get her waxed,
l get ten feet from the car wash
and then, pow, bird shit.

718
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,277
Well, it's supposed to be
good luck.

719
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,749
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

720
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,076
- You were in the "Q," right?
- Yeah.

721
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,431
And l heard you say
you had 15 years.

722
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,278
That's right.

723
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,313
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

724
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,238
Yeah.

725
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,794
Yeah. Funny thing.

726
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,550
l was on north block.
l don't know you.

727
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,877
Well, you know what,
uh, pal?

728
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,391
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly shit.

729
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,750
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block...

730
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,078
and l didn't want to know 159
of them, which included you.

731
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,509
What do you think
about that?

732
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,437
Yeah.

733
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,714
He's a font
of misplaced rage.

734
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,038
Name your cliche. Mother held
him too much, or not enough.

735
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,754
Last picked at kick ball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

736
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,195
Now he's so angry, moments of
levity actually cause him pain.

737
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,833
Gives him headaches.

738
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,474
Happiness, for
that gentleman, hurts.

739
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,516
What's wrong with him?

740
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,632
My first thought would be
a lot.

741
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,918
- Hello.
- Hello.

742
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,156
- Hi. l'm, l'm Vince Larkin.
- l'm Tricia Poe.

743
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,670
Nice to meet ya.
This, this must be Casey.

744
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,473
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.
- Nice to meet ya.

745
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,391
Ao how are you doin'?

746
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,750
l'm sorry. That's, uh-- Acratch
that. Dumb question. You--

747
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,156
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.

748
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,431
Maybe you could just tell me
exactly what's going on here and--

749
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,358
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.

750
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,358
Actually, that's w-why l wanted
to talk to you.

751
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,829
Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get
the rims, man?

752
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,838
My personal shit's
down in the belly.

753
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,068
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

754
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,077
Men!

755
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,675
lt seems that your husband,
Cameron...

756
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,030
had an opportunity to get off
the plane and he didn't do it.

757
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,628
And l was hoping
you could...

758
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,150
maybe help me
figure out why.

759
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,477
That would make two of us.
l don't know.

760
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,511
l mean, it's possible,
it's, it's not uncommon...

761
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,349
that some parolees actually fear
their release date.

762
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,950
A certain degree of institutionalization
sets in. Fear of coming home.

763
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,435
- Fear of living in society.
Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

764
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,155
That's not Cameron. l mean, if you, if
you knew him, if you read his letters...

765
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,919
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that--

766
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,033
l mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna--

767
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,797
l mean, look, he's got this little,
this little girl to come home to.

768
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,795
Wouldn't you...

769
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,876
do the same thing?

770
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,638
There'd have to be a pretty strong
reason to keep me on that plane.

771
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,672
Well, knowing Cameron,
l'm sure there is a good reason.

772
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,311
Uh, maybe, if you, if you do
see him or if you talk to him...

773
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,433
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?

774
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,869
Be kinda nice
to have him around.

775
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,671
You got it.

776
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,796
Vince, line one.

777
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,991
This body fell out
of the sky.

778
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,193
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

779
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,515
We got a problem here
with a corpse.

780
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,518
Yeah, it fell out
of the sky.

781
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,471
l don't think
he's an astronaut.

782
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,478
Then what's this got
to do with me?

783
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,160
lt's got your name
written all over it.

784
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,953
Last transponder tag
was in Arizona.

785
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,310
Body falls here,
in Fresno.

786
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,079
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

787
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,713
- They're coming back.
Can you get me Chief--
- Devers.

788
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,671
Please. Thank you.

789
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,950
- Vince?
- Turn around.

790
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,753
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield. lt's
a small strip about 100 miles from here.

791
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,475
Horseshit! We're tailing the
transponder tag into Arizona.

792
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,795
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

793
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,195
lt had a note on it.

794
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,153
We got 'em vectored
at 12:00 and 30 miles.

795
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,114
- Vince, please, son.
We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

796
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,470
lt was to me!
The note on the body was to me!

797
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,670
- You're chasing the wrong--
- Aw, shut up.

798
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,028
Hello?

799
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,148
Guys, guys! l need a plane
or a chopper now!

800
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,589
Hey, you and me both.
l'm all out.

801
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,280
l've got to get to Lerner Airfield
and l've got about 50 minutes.

802
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,436
Got a fast car,
you can drive it.

803
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,549
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
l'm with the Marshal Aervices.

804
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,148
Aend whatever you got. Aheriff,
state trooper, national guard.

805
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,589
Hold on one minute.

806
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,635
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

807
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,069
lt's only a matter of time
before they find the weapons hold.

808
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,914
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Aervices.

809
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,837
How do you think
l got the number?

810
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,716
"...appears to the United Atates
Parole Commission that--"

811
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,271
Poe.

812
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,597
Man! Oh, yeah!

813
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,588
Put the bunny
back in the box.

814
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,990
l knew you was a punk.
And l was right.

815
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,112
You been playin' us
all along.

816
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,629
You a free man.

817
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,435
l said, put the bunny...

818
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,915
back in the box.

819
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,910
Die, punk!

820
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,514
Why couldn't you put the bunny
back in the box?

821
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,350
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.

822
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,072
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.

823
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,599
Holy shit!

824
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,712
Abort! Abort! Abort!

825
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,436
lf that aircraft's carrying
30 prisoners, l'm Elvis Presley.

826
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,199
"Uncle Bob's Acenic Tours."

827
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,952
Ahit!

828
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,789
Three hundred fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

829
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,593
We need to get
to Lerner Airfield now!

830
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,790
Get me Vince Larkin.

831
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,995
Two went down,
one came up.

832
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,192
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

833
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,914
Most murders are crimes
of necessity rather than desire.

834
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,079
But the great ones,
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...

835
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,395
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you--

836
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,311
l got nothing in common
with them, with you.

837
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,750
Don't you talk to me!
They were insane.

838
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,190
Now you're talking
semantics.

839
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,029
What if l told you insane
was working 50 hours a week
in some office for 50 years...

840
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,754
at the end of which
they tell you to piss off?

841
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,155
Ending up
in some retirement village...

842
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,478
hoping to die before suffering
the indignity of trying to make
it to the toilet on time.

843
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,236
Wouldn't you consider that
to be insane?

844
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:19,753
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane!

845
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,118
One girl...

846
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,196
l drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

847
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,118
lt's my daughter's birthday
today.

848
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,198
Ao please feel free
not to share everything with me.

849
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,548
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.

850
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,875
We're putting this baby
down in a sandbox.

851
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,313
Lerner Tower,
do you copy?

852
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,352
Lerner Tower,
are you there, Phil?

853
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,559
Come on, answer me.

854
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,114
l am landing.

855
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,191
Oh, my God.

856
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,356
Look out!

857
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,433
Lerner Airfield.
l'm so glad to be here.

858
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,154
Thank you
for choosing Con Air.

859
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,959
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- l don't know. Have patience.

860
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,709
The last guy who told me to have
patience? l burned him down,
and bagged his ashes.

861
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,717
Cyrus, it'll be here.

862
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,355
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

863
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,549
l hope he likes sand.

864
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,797
-Muchacho, run and check out the
tower. Have a look-see, yeah?
-All right.

865
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,151
You come with us.

866
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,388
- Let's go. We're gettin' off.
- Boss, l can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

867
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,988
- You shouldn't move him.
- l'm getting him off of this plane.

868
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,908
You, you can't move him. He's
too far along. He could go into shock.

869
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,190
Ahe's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

870
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,550
l'm not leaving
without you, or you.

871
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,478
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

872
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,717
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

873
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,274
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck or hit the fence.

874
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,709
- l suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

875
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,070
Just go.

876
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,397
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
l'm gonna get you that needle.

877
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,080
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

878
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,679
Fuck.

879
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,314
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

880
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,795
Awing low, sweet chariot

881
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,753
Comin' for
to carry me home

882
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,395
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

883
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,114
- lt's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

884
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,073
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

885
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,751
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

886
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,668
l can't think of a thing
l'd like better...

887
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,998
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

888
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,874
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

889
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,958
l mean, l don't know him that
well myself. Just what l read.

890
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,038
Like how he firebombed
that senator's yacht with two
of his own cousins on board.

891
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,435
Ao what's your point?

892
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,949
Why would he sweat
about killing some hired guns
once they'd served his purpose?

893
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,709
- Now think about that.
- What exactly are we discussing here?

894
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,115
Poe don't want me
to off the pigs.

895
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:02,789
Well, it's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards.

896
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,354
And my own proclivities
are, uh...

897
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,600
well-known and, uh,
often-lamented facts of penal lore.

898
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,439
What l'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

899
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,199
Cyrus, this is your barbecue,
man, and it tastes good.

900
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,472
But l was just sayin' to Mr Dog over
here, that if it was my barbecue...

901
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,195
l'd wait for that old jumbo jet
in the sky before l start
killin' our only leverage.

902
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,914
- Ahut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high
and get laid?

903
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,393
- Ahit.
- Oh, fuck this!

904
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,832
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

905
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,394
Poe's right.
We're goin' to Plan "B."

906
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,193
Gonna get a refuelling truck
and a tractor.

907
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,595
Ao get back there
and dig the plane out.

908
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,512
No. Yes!

909
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,071
- Viking, 'bout time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?
- Right.

910
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,354
- l'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

911
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,074
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

912
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,636
"Many hands make light work."
My daddy taught me that.

913
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,149
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

914
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,114
- Nothin'.
- Aelf-educated man.

915
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,797
-Have you found Vince Larkin?
-We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

916
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,514
Of course, you're having trouble
reaching him!

917
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,031
He's off saving the rain forest
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

918
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,995
Holy shit!

919
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,397
Hey! We've got company!

920
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,476
Hey!

921
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,989
We've got company!

922
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,993
Go get Cyrus.

923
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,678
Yo, Cyrus!

924
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,356
How long we got
till they get here, Nathan?

925
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,109
Ten, twelve minutes, tops.

926
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,476
Hey, what's your name?
Wanna play?

927
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,477
Nice jet.

928
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,637
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all l care.

929
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,548
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.

930
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,075
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

931
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,918
Freeze!

932
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,516
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

933
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,234
- l'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

934
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,510
- l got your message.
- Where are the troops?

935
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,234
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

936
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,954
Uh-huh. ln a minute.

937
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,595
Listen, Poe,
can l lower this?

938
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,632
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

939
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,718
Aorry, boss, but there's only
two men l trust.

940
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,070
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

941
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,715
- Ao Cindino was running
a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.

942
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,354
lf you can't trust a Aouth American
drug lord, who can you trust, huh?

943
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,748
- That was a joke.
- l'm glad you told me. Now
l gotta get back to the plane.

944
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,198
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

945
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,517
l can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

946
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,200
You got a friend on board?

947
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,029
Aee, l knew l was right
about you. l read your file.

948
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,516
You're not such a bad guy. Just always
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

949
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,676
Goodbye, Larkin.

950
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,875
l spoke to your wife.

951
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,269
- ln person?
- ln person.

952
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,111
And your little girl.

953
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,998
You saw Casey?

954
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,159
lf this thing goes bad, Larkin,
l'm afraid my daughter...

955
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,352
won't understand.

956
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:32,553
lf you talk to my wife again,
you tell her...

957
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,477
l love her.

958
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,313
Ahe's my hummingbird.

959
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,877
But l couldn't leave
a fallen man behind.

960
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,232
You'll do that for me,
won't you, Larkin?

961
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,319
Aure l will.
What are you gonna do for me?

962
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,715
What do you think
l'm gonna do?

963
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,717
l'm gonna save
the fuckin' day.

964
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,029
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

965
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,870
- l want this aeroplane out now.
- Come on, men!

966
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,715
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

967
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,155
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

968
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,758
Are you sick?

969
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,156
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

970
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,230
- l am sick.
- You take medicine?

971
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,351
There is no medicine
for what l have.

972
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,519
- Wanna sing?
- Aing?

973
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,108
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?

974
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,719
Yes, l do.

975
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,594
He's got the whole world
in His hands

976
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,676
He's got
the whole wide world

977
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,631
Come on.

978
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,788
He's got the whole world
in His hands

979
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,993
He's got the whole wide world
in His hands

980
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,398
He's got the whole world
in His hands

981
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,229
He's got the whole world
in His hands

982
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,113
lt's on the ground. Repeat.
The plane is on the ground.

983
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,071
But it won't be for long.
Where the hell are ya?

984
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,191
We're westbound
near the Lerner cutoff.

985
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,951
Where's Cindino?

986
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,310
That's my fuckin' plane!

987
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,037
Cyrus, help me.

988
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,230
- Looks like you missed your connection.
- We were-- We were coming to get you.

989
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,031
Please.

990
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,752
- Cy--
- --Onara.

991
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,155
No!

992
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,833
- Don't kill me.
- l'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.

993
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,269
Listen, l need a syringe.

994
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,551
Oh, no!
Drugs'll end you, son.

995
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,636
ls there a first aid kit
around here?

996
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,274
Well, there might be one in the
fire truck over on the boneyard.

997
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,632
All right, thanks. You just
stay here and don't panic.

998
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,718
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.

999
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,469
- Let's get it on.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Lock and load!

1000
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,196
Considering my audience, l'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.

1001
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,915
This is the boneyard.
This is the hangar.

1002
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,837
This is our plane.

1003
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,555
- What's that?
- That's a rock.

1004
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,352
Okay.

1005
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,677
The convoy will enter
the boneyard through here.

1006
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,031
lnitially, we take out the first car.
Then we take out the last...

1007
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,833
creating a trap,
an airtight cage...

1008
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,157
filled with lots and lots
of dead people.

1009
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,510
Nathan, set everybody
in their position, yeah?

1010
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,555
Bring me
those propane tanks.

1011
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,198
Whoo, go girl.

1012
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,278
Let's go, let's go. Get 'em in there.
lf they give you any trouble, kill 'em.

1013
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,118
What can l do?

1014
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,277
Take this. Go into
the boneyard, yeah?

1015
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,676
- Anybody gets through,
you scratch their eyes out.
- You got it.

1016
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,633
Come on, little piggy.

1017
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,398
Closer. Closer. Closer.

1018
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,431
Christ.
They'll be slaughtered.

1019
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,875
This is Larkin.
Tell your men to fall back!

1020
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,718
Now.

1021
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,712
Come on, you stinking
piece-of-shit car!

1022
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,994
- What are you gonna do?
- What you doin', man?

1023
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,596
Well, Baby-O...

1024
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,110
it's not exactly mai tais
and Yahtzee out here, but...

1025
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,108
let's do it!

1026
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,120
Gonna see what happens
now, bitch!

1027
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,639
Bishop.

1028
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,039
- Get the fuck off me!
- l'm gonna bust your ass!

1029
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,473
Leave her alone, man!

1030
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,470
Get behind the truck!

1031
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,272
Get behind the truck!

1032
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,389
- When you wake up, Bishop,
l'll be Johnny 24.
- You wanna fight somebody?

1033
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:43,038
Don't treat women
like that!

1034
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,359
Aw, shit!

1035
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,599
Whoa! Whoa!

1036
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,160
Get back to the plane!

1037
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,239
Oh, my god!

1038
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,593
Okay!

1039
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,357
You might better
get yourself a seat now.

1040
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,789
- Come on.
- Oh, shit! We're in.

1041
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,876
Just take it and let's go.
Get ready to move.

1042
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,589
We're tied up!

1043
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,234
- Now, come on!
- Okay, l'm comin'.

1044
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,551
- Go for the tyres!
- Fuck the tyres!
l'm goin' for the pilot!

1045
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,237
lsn't that your car,
Malloy?

1046
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,432
Couldn't be.
l left mine at the office.

1047
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,592
On any other day,
that might seem strange.

1048
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,436
Gotta get her nose up!

1049
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,080
Fuckers!
Come on!

1050
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,988
- When this is over,
so are you, you little prick!
- Okay.

1051
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,477
Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye.

1052
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,748
Go, girl!

1053
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,110
Aweet home Alabama

1054
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,629
All right!

1055
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,115
Where the skies
are so blue

1056
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,549
Define irony.

1057
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,716
Bunch of idiots
dancing on a plane...

1058
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,709
to a song made famous by a band
that died in a plane crash.

1059
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,029
ln Birmingham
they love the governor

1060
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,073
We all did
what we could do

1061
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:20,839
Now Watergate
does not bother me

1062
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,192
Does you conscience bother you
Tell me true

1063
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,108
Aweet home Alabama

1064
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:35,438
Aomeone alerted the authorities
at Carson City.

1065
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,358
Aomeone told them
about our Lerner rendezvous.

1066
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,392
Aomeone even killed
poor Billy Bedlam.

1067
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,275
Now, could this all
be coincidence? Perhaps.

1068
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,995
Then someone went
and tied a rope to our plane.

1069
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:54,352
Ao l ask you,
what is going on?

1070
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,110
And l answer.
We have a traitor in our midst.

1071
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:03,074
Now, how do we flush
a traitor?

1072
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,873
l don't know,
but at the count of three...

1073
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,309
l will find out who is
on my team and who is not.

1074
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,556
That would be one, two--

1075
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,070
Wait! lt was me.

1076
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,792
lt was me.

1077
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,754
Don't listen to him, man.
T-T-The insulin made him crazy.

1078
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,838
You have been near death
the entire trip?

1079
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,872
- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.
- No, he's, he's flipped out,
man. He's nuts.

1080
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,752
lt's pretty clever,
huh, bitch?

1081
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,475
- No! Jesus!
- No, that's clever!

1082
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,509
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

1083
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,757
My birthday is July 14th.

1084
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,997
l'm gonna see my daddy
for the first time ever...

1085
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,556
on July 14th."

1086
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,875
Make a move,
and the bunny gets it.

1087
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,876
- Let's take him out, Larkin.
- Not yet!

1088
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,479
Fire!

1089
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,477
Goddamn it, Malloy!

1090
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,830
- Cease fire!
- Get up here!

1091
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,434
- What are we waiting for?
- That is my plane!

1092
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,676
You got it, Agent Malloy?
You with me?

1093
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,473
Or do you need me to draw it
in crayon, like usual?

1094
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,319
l got a bad feeling, son.

1095
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,194
- l'm feeling like maybe
l'm not supposed to make it.
- You're gonna make it.

1096
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,674
Cyrus Grissom, this is
Apecial Agent Vince Larkin.

1097
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,952
We will shoot the plane down
if you do not respond now.

1098
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,719
All l can think about is like,
there ain't no God.

1099
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,479
That He don't exist.

1100
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,550
- Hey, where you goin'?
- l'm gonna show you God does exist!

1101
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,392
Fire!

1102
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,557
Malloy, you son of a bitch!
Cease fire!

1103
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,038
Yes!

1104
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,511
Freeze, little bitch boy!

1105
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,477
- Awitch to missile.
- Roger that, Two.

1106
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,830
Arming missiles.

1107
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,076
Malloy, don't you do it!
Get in his way.

1108
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,553
Ahit!

1109
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,549
What the hell
are you doing, Larkin?

1110
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,636
- l got no move, sir.
- Atupid bastard!

1111
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,794
- No! Poe!
- Land this thing!

1112
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,356
- Where the hell is the Virus?
- l'm the new captain.
Put this thing down.

1113
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,038
Target locked, sir.

1114
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,879
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't you do it!

1115
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,195
- Don't shoot!
- Don't fire.

1116
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,799
- Who is this?
- ldentify yourself.

1117
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,115
- This is Cameron Poe.
- Yes!

1118
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,037
Poe!

1119
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,835
Poe!

1120
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,953
- l repeat, target is locked, sir.
- Malloy, he's got the plane!

1121
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,596
We're not over civilian population.
Now is the time, sir.

1122
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,598
- Don't fire.
- Malloy, listen to him! He's a friend!

1123
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,439
He's just trying to get home
to see his wife and kid! Don't fire!

1124
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,710
Now's the time, sir.

1125
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,112
- Hold fire.
- Air?

1126
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,834
- l said hold fire!
- Thank you.

1127
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,158
Poe!

1128
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,119
Poe!

1129
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:43,038
- Cyrus!
- What?

1130
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,718
All right, Poe,
the Las Vegas Airport.

1131
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,195
lt's just past the strip.
Can you see it?

1132
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,550
Well, viva Las Vegas.

1133
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,389
lt's right there, man. You can
make it. All the runways are
cleared. Come on, do it, Poe.

1134
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,192
Put this thing down.

1135
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,869
Listen here, big daddy.
We got one engine shot to shit...

1136
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,878
zero fuel,
and we're droppin' too fast.

1137
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,437
The strip's where l'm gonna
land. Only the word is crash.

1138
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,191
Ahould've shot 'em down
over the open desert, Larkin.

1139
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,311
Now the civilian casualties
will be enormous.

1140
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:29,757
Atrap in, ladies. We're goin'
for a night out in Vegas.

1141
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:35,508
He's got the whole world
in His hands

1142
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,349
He's got the whole world
in His hands

1143
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,314
- He's got the whole wide world
in His hands
- Ahut the fuck up, you freak!
We're gonna die!

1144
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,555
- Can he make it to the airport?
- No way, sir.

1145
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,633
All right. We're gonna need
police cars, uh, fire engines,
emergency service vehicles,

1146
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,479
anybody who knows CPR.

1147
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,157
Oh, this is beautiful!

1148
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,231
Wake up, Cyrus!

1149
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,191
ln His hands

1150
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,752
Little, bitty babies

1151
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,639
Cyrus, wake up!

1152
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,310
Atay with me.

1153
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:59,598
Will the driver of the
white corvette please move
your car or it will be towed.

1154
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:02,234
We are shit outta road!
l'm outta here!

1155
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,551
Before l kill you, Poe,
l just wanted you to know...

1156
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:21,309
that the last thing that little
Casey Poe ever gets to smell...

1157
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,352
will be my stinking breath.

1158
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,357
Freeze!

1159
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,597
Okay, lady,
hold it right there!

1160
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:49,634
- How am l doin', son?
- You're doin' fine.

1161
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,036
Check you out at the hospital,
son. You're gonna be fine.

1162
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,870
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.

1163
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,150
Ao what are you
gonna do now?

1164
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,989
l started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and l'm gonna get to it.

1165
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,836
Thank you.

1166
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,713
You take care,
Aally Bishop.

1167
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,151
Hey, Poe.

1168
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,669
Next time, take the bus.

1169
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:10,115
Come on, sweetie.
Go with Ginny and your mom.

1170
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,916
- Cyrus.
- Grissom.

1171
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,473
Move!

1172
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,710
Come get it!
Come on now!

1173
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,512
- That gun work?
- Yeah.

1174
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,790
Well, shoot
that piece of shit!

1175
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,038
Jesus!

1176
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,630
- What the hell is that?
- You pull over.

1177
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,352
Yeah, sure.
How 'bout this?

1178
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,311
You ain't gettin' near
my daughter. Buckle up.

1179
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,355
Just so's you know,
Marshal Larkin...

1180
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,189
there's now three men
l trust.

1181
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,356
Am l one of 'em?

1182
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,114
This is a weird thing to be
on a plane full of hard asses.

1183
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,472
- You okay?
- No.

1184
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,795
Good. l'm glad we didn't
shoot it down, huh?

1185
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,275
Oh, yeah, worked out
much better this way.

1186
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,955
Listen, l--

1187
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,753
l wanna apologize
about the car.

1188
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,916
l know a good body shop
in Fresno if it's insured.

1189
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,748
- l was bored with that car anyway.
- lt worked out nicely then.

1190
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,552
How do l

1191
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:34,391
Get through one night
without you

1192
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:38,832
lf l had to live
without you

1193
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,350
What kind of life

1194
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,870
Oh, now

1195
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,356

Need you to hold me

1196

Without you

1202
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:16,075
A little dirty.

1203
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,555
Casey, sweetie, you take
your daddy's present now.

1204
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,796

Baby, l don't know

01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:37,157

1209
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:41,751
lf you ever leave

1210
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:43,359
- Baby, you would take away
- Happy birthday, darlin'.

01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:48,600

New shooter comin' out, new shooter.
Does the new shooter feel lucky?

1220
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:21,916
Well, does he?

1221
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,077
Yes, yes he does.

1222
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,073
Big wheels keep on turnin'

1223

Carry me home to see my kin
