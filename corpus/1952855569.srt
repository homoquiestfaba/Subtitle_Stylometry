Now, the first ship.

37
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,653
A week after getting married, John!
I received a signal.

But what if you take other than a sign?
Then you'll start from scratch.

43
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,267
Throughout my life this day
I waited.

44
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:08,897
This marriage further.
Otherwise the marriage will not occur.

45

In the UK, little lords and ladies
I thought I was doing.

00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,675
This is changing, John.
Every day.

00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,005
All continents are invaded.

00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,962
On the river

These new arrivals
people are so vile.

55

Slow down!

62
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:19,456
That honor belongs to me.

The cradle of the human species.

76
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,746
The man she finds the city. . .

77
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,317
. . . Mizungular treasures to plunder
Africa will occupy.

No Mizungu Opar'a
touches.

80
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,581
Spiritual strength to me.
I'm not a fighter.

81
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:11,774
For this, I called you.

82

Forever
I can live here.

316
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:47,148
I hope it is not without me?

An elephant and who knows what sirtindayim
I'm going to hazard.

Prove it!

323
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:26,111
At worst
do you do in a bathroom!

324
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,609
Absolutely perfect!

325
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:20,110
I introduce my family.

326
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,704
That Chebo. The most important of my family
is one of the members.

327
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:45,239
The most important member of the mean.

328
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:47,951
Also introduce others.

329
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:49,599
I just wonder.

330
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:51,967
Do not be afraid.

331
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:54,714
Little need to get used to.
Fiancée's family amazes me.

332
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:04,978
I agreed.
You're my first friend.

333
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,313
I will invite them to tea.

334
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:12,050
Who is he? Many friendly
does not seem friendly.

335
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:16,272
The chief of the herd.

336
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:19,362
To undermine the authority of
He thinks I'm back.

337
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,524
Where are you going?
Works to correct!

338
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,473
How horrible
a barbarity!

339
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,223
I'm sorry for being a witness to this.

340
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:47,209
Received by the first opportunity
was going to kill me!

341
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:49,613
Is that rule of the forest? Everyone
trying to kill each other?

342
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:54,213
Maybe. But the two armies on the battlefield
not face its more brutal.

343
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:57,989
Both good in this world and
There are primitive violence.

344
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:04,649
Will try to attack again?

345
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,102
No. Defeated. To come close to us again
lot of it is shattered.

346
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:13,574
Find a new family
forced. Or are you going to die.

347
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,900
Come on.
Home will go to appeal.

348
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:24,972
Here, we may be dry.

349
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:39,905
I think woman's hand
touching is required.

350
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,234
Thank you very much.

351
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,117
Very friendly.

352
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,240
My father's books.

353
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:10,835
I learned to read myself, but
never fully understand.

354
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,512
Most of the time only
I was looking for paintings.

355
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:19,383
My childhood was like.

356
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,713
Just like your childhood
Such as London to pass.

357
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:26,111
The worlds
I know separates.

358
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:29,784
Very nice house.

359
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:34,590
I love you, John.

360
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:36,581
Smokin 'in the tree you wear
dolassan I love you.

361
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:20,695
What happened?

362
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,367
Nothing.
A moment too old.

363
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,211
Incredible! In front of it
coding 'spread' the man standing.

364
00:39:36,314 --> 00:39:37,996
Divided into two!
My turn.

365
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,575
No, no, you
guns do not work.

366
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,223
Dinamitlerinle you play!

367
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,180
The worst areas of engagement
made for a weapon.

368
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,862
Let's see what you gonna do?

369
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,084
How many
able to locate the carrier?

370
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,561
Fifteen. Different villages.

371
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,135
Are most good.
Fine.

372
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:54,371
We'll set off at dawn.

373
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,201
Back to the fucking idiots.

374
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:01,931
What's happening?

375
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,537
Be careful!

376
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,253
Tonga, an old friend.

377
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,450
Is an old friend?

378
00:41:24,793 --> 00:41:27,952
This is a huge snake and
fear of freaked me out!

379
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:30,595
Harmless. Come on
take it outside.

380
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:03,620
Dress!

381
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,455
I think I stayed a little late.

382
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,355
What is this?

383
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:17,866
Need to go.

384
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:32,009
Do you see that?

385
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,374
Do not be afraid. Most of all
courage respect.

386
00:42:36,026 --> 00:42:37,640
That is in question can not be faint.

387
00:42:48,419 --> 00:42:48,830
Wait.

388
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,778
Some of them do you mean?

389
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,764
Their friends
You could say that.

390
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,069
Headed off to Oparin.

391
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,438
Attack them and
need to avoid.

392
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,188
On a war
can not win.

393
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,798
Tarzan is right.
This time, very different!

394
00:43:58,278 --> 00:44:00,750
Tarzan what you find in a woman
The heart has been softened.

395
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:02,637
We're not soft.

396
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:06,173
Mizungular could beat us.
Do Kokanalardan more powerful?

397
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:07,958
Wadebelelerden, Molinassalardan?

398
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:09,572
Yenmistik them all!

399
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:13,863
Mizungularin softened the heart between
Tarzan can not help us.

400
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:16,300
People come here and
yenemeyecegimizi says!

401
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:17,639
They are not my people.

402
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,184
Your people then who?

403
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:21,107
We do not.

404
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,132
To me you're a
Mizungu look like.

405
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,291
Please.

406
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,179
Mizungular kötülerdir and
Mizungu said to me.

407
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:31,062
Going to let it go like it
we Mizunguyuz.

408
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,392
In the coming days
will be more war.

409
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,726
Do not be mad.
We need you.

410
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:38,717
I could
I'll do anything.

411
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:54,303
Both make you what to do
as well as kollayamazsin me.

412
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:56,328
Take me to the river
find one.

413
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:59,040
All this until the Captain
Dooley, let it lead me Chiromo'ya

414
00:44:59,315 --> 00:44:59,933
I'm so sorry.

415
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:02,713
Why?

416
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:12,600
Dooley'i fighters in the river
They found as many seriously injured.

417
00:45:13,664 --> 00:45:14,900
Timsahlardan saved him.

418
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,268
This was good for him.

419
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,290
Died in peace.

420
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:26,709
So what works for him
What happened to him?

421
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:55,614
Used a short time ago.

422
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:58,086
All of these
found in a region.

423
00:45:58,567 --> 00:45:59,184
Use a machine gun!

424
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,171
Mbikolarin the slightest
do not even have a chance.

425
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,432
Forest Ravens'dan know better.
They know how to defend themselves.

426
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,281
No they did not see the power of a machine gun.
Will make a massacre.

427
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:09,929
Yes. So Ravens'i
I have to stop!

428
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:26,201
Shake a rope and
skip to the other side.

429
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,643
Upload ll.

430
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,328
Do you çildirdiniz?

431
00:46:38,594 --> 00:46:39,624
This is formally committed suicide!

432
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:42,714
Shut up!

433
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:46,593
What did he say? I did not deserve the money
White said it was a coward!

434
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:48,584
Inmekle down the river
something to do, he said.

435
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:53,493
Maybe you
Mr. Wilkes is a korkaksindir!

436
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,567
This is the person that can pass the rope to the other party
2 times the fees on your face!

437
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,545
Wait here.
Keep your gun ready!

438
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,222
Is not more than me
where should our together!

439
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:37,605
The Lost City to look at
do not have the courage.

440
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:53,912
Go here.

441
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:56,692
Come on, Jane, c'mon!

442
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,652
Get 4 men and follow me.

443
00:48:07,712 --> 00:48:08,845
Keep your business!

444
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,757
I can not believe!
We killed him!

445
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:19,356
This way.

446
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,432
What happened?
I can not believe! Struck me.

447
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:29,518
You better believe!

448
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,223
Back off!

449
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:00,112
Tell me what to do.

450
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:01,965
Do not touch it.
Rip it.

451
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:02,996
Yirtsana!

452
00:51:25,412 --> 00:51:27,953
I isirdiysa
Will die within 20 minutes.

453
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:30,424
Do not touch it.

454
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:31,935
But the dead!

455
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:35,058
Fucking asshole!

456
00:51:35,436 --> 00:51:36,775
Pray at the mouth of
get the poison out.

457
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:38,937
Where is he?
A cobra bit him.

458
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:40,551
I'm gonna die!

459
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,027
We are all going to die.

460
00:51:42,095 --> 00:51:42,919
This way!

461
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:55,175
More
can not take it!

462
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,265
Do a little sikistirayim?
Very late.

463
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,226
Let me go.

464
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:02,109
No, I left you, John.

465
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:10,932
This way.

466
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,626
My head is spinning!

467
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:26,490
To point us away from it
Mrs. Porter, a very akillicaydi.

468
00:53:28,001 --> 00:53:29,889
But a movement that has been wasted.

469
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:33,561
Us for repair it yourself major
you will be saving the inconvenience.

470
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,994
Any discomfort in your crazy
movements is not the reason not to participate.

471
00:53:37,544 --> 00:53:38,677
Be reasonable.

472
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:40,874
Here, for a long time
I do not think dayanabileceginizi.

473
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:43,963
Clayton us for assistance. Still alive
that'll help him.

474
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:47,156
Until you are a coward or a liar!
I do not ever help you.

475
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,250
Such a shame.

476
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:51,756
Share the treasure and fame. . .

477
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:07,135
Traces on the tree
going to the right.

478
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:09,641
Keep away from there
I prefer.

479
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,084
If you still live in
rode above us.

480
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:14,139
The snake should have killed him.
Let's go.

481
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:19,940
Such a shame. I myself
I wanted to kill.

482
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:33,576
Hey, more careful

Are you still worried?
No.

486
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:37,743
You are wrong!

487
00:58:50,177 --> 00:58:52,066
Now who
wants to go back?

488
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:54,983

Let's go!

496
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,146

They bury us alive!

505
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:55,828
It's a trap!

506
01:01:58,574 --> 01:02:00,188
Afraid to get in. Flashlights!

507
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:07,466
Lighthouses close!
Moving on!

508
01:02:13,782 --> 01:02:15,670
Find a way to us.

Pull blocks.

Anyone entering the die there.
The road to Opar'a sacred.

What is it?
Worms do not have anything else.

521
01:04:40,401 --> 01:04:42,220
Schiller, Ackerman!
Come here!

522
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,601

We can continue.

Let's go.

527
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:33,748

Everyone is firing position!

531
01:06:00,216 --> 01:06:01,761
Schiller, open the door!

532
01:06:02,688 --> 01:06:03,580
Kill him!

533
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:07,116

Was it worth it?

604
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:30,804
