<i>...public enemy number one in the United States...</i>

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,123
<i>...is drug abuse.</i>

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,007
<i>In order to fight and defeat this enemy...</i>

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,961
<i>...it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive.</i>

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,363
<i>For nearly a year,
I have been devoting increasing attention...</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,331
<i>...to a problem which strikes at the
very heart of our national well-being:</i>

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,561
<i>Drug abuse.</i>

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,611
<i>I did not condone any drug abuse,
and we'll do everything possible to reduce...</i>

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,688
<i>...this serious threat to our society.</i>

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,047
<i>Drugs are menacing our society.</i>

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>They're threatening our values and
undercutting our institutions.</i>

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,008
<i>They're killing our children.</i>

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,765
Thank you very much.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,885
<i>...and when it comes to
drugs and alcohol, just say“no.”</i>

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,770
<i>Reagan says he will make it
a priority of his presidency...</i>

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,207
<i>...to stop drug abuse in the United States.</i>

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,164
<i>This is your brain on drugs.</i>

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,609
<i>Those who smuggle and sell drugs are
as dangerous to our national security...</i>

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,411
<i>...as any terrorist or foreign dictatorship.</i>

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,241
<i>The Reagan administration
is spending billions on two wars...</i>

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,368
<i>...the war on drugs at home
and the struggle for</i>

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,681
<i>Nicaragua abroad.</i>

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,650
<i>If we do not act decisively
in defense of freedom...</i>

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,526
<i>...new Cubas will arise from
the ruins of today's conflicts.</i>

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,728
<i>We will consult closely
with the Freedom Fighters.</i>

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,280
<i>The anti-communist
rebels known as the “contras”...</i>

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,200
<i>...an army founded and funded by the CIA.</i>

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,650
<i>Crack cocaine...</i>

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,924
<i>...a drug epidemic unlike any that's ever
probably existed in the history of the world.</i>

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,931
<i>For five dollars, you can begin
the process of addicting people.</i>

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,963
<i>Waging the war on drugs has
...one hundred billion dollars over the last ten years.</i>

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,721
<i>The crack trade has triggered a spasm of
gang warfare in south-central L.A...</i>

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,802
<i>...and DEA agents are swarming throughout.</i>

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,684
<i>How many of you have crack houses...</i>

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,047
<i>...in your neighborhood?</i>

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,409
<i>No brave law enforcement officer...</i>

<i>...no teacher, no doctor,</i>

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,049
<i>need be told how hard and cruel
America's drug problem has become.</i>

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,326
<i>By nineteen eighty-four,</i>

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,324
<i>Congress was preparing
to cut off funds to the Contras.</i>

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,247
<i>High-level government officials began looking
for other ways to continue the aid program.</i>

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,331
There must be no Soviet beachhead
in Central America.

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,401
Good morning.

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,120
Who the fuck are you?

45
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,720
Gary Webb. San Jose Mercury-News.

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,241
What do you want?

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,086
I called you about the government seizure of
property of accused narcotics dealers?

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,841
Yeah. The accused. Yeah, that's me.
Come on in.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,922
Okay, great. Thanks.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,085
- My last house, this sweet pad in Laguna -
- Yeah?

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,044
Charges didn't stick and
the feds still didn't give it back.

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,641
- But you did it?
- Did what?

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,050
Well, off the record, I mean, you sold the dope.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah, but you're missing the point.
They took the freaking roof over my head.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,761
Look, wait a sec...

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,645
All this stuff that you bought
with the drug money - the houses,

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,410
the cars, what have you -

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,691
...you lose it because it's
the crime that paid for it, right?

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,762
Did it, didn't do it... Who gives a shit?

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,522
Can't take a man's shelter.
Anyway, they didn't prove it, did they?

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,045
LA Sheriff's Department - nobody move!

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,610
- Let me see your hands!

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,808
Christ. Here we go again.

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,922
- Down, motherfucker down!
- Get the girl!

65
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,087
Secure the girl!

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,922
Look, I'm a reporter.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,081
Shut the fuck up!

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,127
Better get that story out there.

69
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,561
- San Jose Mercury News -
- Hey!

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,610
I'm a reporter!

71
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,569
Quite a ruckus over there, huh?

72
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,405
<i>Yeah, this guy almost broke my fucking arm,
the prick.</i>

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,921
All right.

74
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,925
Hey, wait a minute.

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,441
Where...

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Yeah, I'm sorry. We ran outta inches.

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,882
Look, you cut the kicker and you're gonna
blow the whole point to this thing.

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,645
The government takes
these people's shit, all right?

79
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,206
Their cars, their houses,
they take everything forever.

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,169
This is before they're convicted.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,766
<i>Even if they're acquitted,
they don't get it back.</i>

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,605
They're drug dealers.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,406
Alleged drug dealers, with rights.
Because this is America.

84
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,645
Four minutes until deadline.

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,922
Well, take my name off the story.

86
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,247
<i>God, you can be such an asshole.</i>

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,571
I'm an asshole because
I believe in due process?

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,248
<i>Come on. This is our job.</i>

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,331
<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

90
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,808
It's ticking.

91
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,084
<i>It's still ticking.</i>

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,409
And...

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,170
...don't call back.

94
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,801
This guy just had a shotgun in his ear.
Give him a break.

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,288
No, there was no shotgun. All right, look,

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
you're gonna have
to wait to read the article.

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,602
Your son is sixteen. Just FYI.

98
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,290
- I see you! Get rid of it. Honey?

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,209
Come on, don't do that.

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
- That's bad.
- That's amazing parenting.

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,764
- “Don't do that.”
- Don't do that.

102
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,604
It's really not a big deal.

103
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,241
Would somebody watch this?

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,404
I gotta show you guys something.

105
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,129
New addition to the family...

106
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,682
Oh my god!

107
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,046
Dad!

108
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,210
Holy...

109
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,442
This is a '71 Tiger Sports Triumph.

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,762
It's a beautiful bike
or it was a beautiful bike...

111
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,682
...and we're going to make it beautiful again.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,807
This is the only deal.

113
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,366
- You and I have to rebuild it together, okay?
- Hey, hotshot.

114
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,805
- Okay. I love you, Dad.
- All right. I love you.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,241
- We're happy.
- Goddammit.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,044
Yes?

117
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,089
- We talked about this.
- Come on...

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,361
- No, “come on." No.
- Look at him.

119
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,124
- Look at this. Look at the bike...
- I see it.

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,561
Look at this face.

121
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,244
Inside my head.

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,251
Me and my boy riding side by side,
to the mountaintops...

123
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,651
- Touching the sky.
- Isn't that right?

124
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,001
- Anything happens to him while he's on that bike
- Nothing's going to happen to him.

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,163
...I will cut these off
while you are sleeping.

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,562
- Wow.
- I thought you already cut those off.

127
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,166
While I'm sleeping!

128
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,887
Dad, you hang out with
some insanely bad people.

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,450
Don't eat your hair.

130
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,362
Well...

131
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,602
...bad guys are usually more
honest than good guys.

132
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,324
And more fun.

133
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,171
- Life lessons by Gary Webb.
- No, Mom. You actually have to read this.

134
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,083
I did already. It's great.

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
You guys gotta go, come on.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,168
You heard the lady!

137
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,130
Come on! Who wants to ride
in the green machine?

138
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,242
- Dad's taking us?
- I'm taking you.

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,249
You're not going in your PJ's, are you?

140
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,571
Come on, guys!

141
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,085
- Let's get smushed.
- That's where I sit.

142
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,646
Got it? Step in like sardines.

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,125
Bye, Momma!

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,531
Bye Momma!

145
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,290
- Bye, Momma!
- Bye.

146
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,090
Bye Momma!

147
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,688
- One, two, three...
- Bye, Mom!

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Here you go.

149
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,003
- It's probably cold.
- Thank you.

150
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,402
Hey, I know how bad you want
to do the Guv today.

151
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,245
Some real reporter work.

152
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,601
Yeah. How that shit gives you satisfaction,
I'll never know.

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,131
Hey, that story this morning?

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,401
That was a big one.

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,927
- But not “the" big one.
- Yeah, what would that be?

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,202
Catching Clinton breaking into Watergate?

157
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,601
Hey.

158
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,843
Rich Kline, LA Times. How you doing?

159
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,805
My editors are pissed that
we missed the drug forfeiture story.

160
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,410
I'm sure they are.

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,324
It's an amazing job, by the way.
You got any advice for me, or...?

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,923
Ah, yeah. Don't let the assholes win?
I don't know.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,685
Hey, who's Coral Baca and
why does she keep calling me?

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,330
Nobody?

165
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,689
She called five times...?

166
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,366
- <i>Hola?</i>
- Hi, this is Gary Webb.

167
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,445
<i>He finally calls. I like your work.</i>

168
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,404
You follow my work?

169
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,410
<i>I do now.</i>

170
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,764
Okay, what can I do for you?

171
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,647
<i>It's what I can do for you.</i>

172
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,405
Okay, what can you do for me?

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,445
<i>My boyfriend Raffie's</i> in <i>prison,
for cocaine trafficking.</i>

174
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,206
<i>That's Rafael Cornejo.</i>

175
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,331
Was that Columbian?

176
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,287
- <i>Nicaraguan.</i>

177
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
- Nicaraguan.

178
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,240
<i>He has this gorgeous house
the government just took.</i>

179
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,085
<i>Good story, no?</i>

180
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,690
Yes, it is. I just wrote it.

181
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,891
<i>But Raffie's story is different.
He sold drugs for the government.</i>

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,405
You want to say that again?

183
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,411
<i>He brought four tons
of cocaine into the country...</i>

184
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,091
<i>...for the U.S. government.</i>

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,845
Look, you have a very lovely voice.

186
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,129
- Thank you-
- <i>I've copied every piece of paper.</i>

187
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,766
<i>Selling drugs for the government.</i>

188
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,044
<i>Have you written that story?</i>

189
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,643
This is the thing you need to see.

190
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,606
Wait a minute.

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,010
You gotta be kidding me.

192
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,085
Grand Jury transcript?

193
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,966
How'd you get ahold of it?

194
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,765
The government turned it over
on discovery by mistake.

195
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,330
Yeah, some mistake.

196
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,289
It was Russell Dodson.

197
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,364
Federal prosecutor Russell Dodson?

198
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,569
The little bitch.
I called the cops on him once.

199
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,605
Called the cops on the feds?

200
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,564
His goons were sneaking around my house.

201
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,604
Could have been rapists.

202
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,929
I think I'm gonna like you.

203
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,248
So who's this Danilo Blandon?

204
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,845
Wait.

205
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,764
Ok. Let's see.

206
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,124
That's who sold drugs for the government.

207
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,965
He was a friend.

208
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,128
He played with my kid.

209
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,571
Then he rats.

210
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,371
He's probably the biggest trafficker
in the whole country.

211
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,602
Way bigger than Raffie.

212
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,406
Why use whale to catch catfish?

213
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,003
- That make sense to you Gary Webb?
- Not very much sense. No it doesn't.

214
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,924
You have more documents?

215
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,088
Everything is at my house.

216
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,090
You want to come over?

217
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,561
Why don't you just send the documents
to my office? How's that?

218
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,242
First things first, Gary Webb.

219
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,968
Raffie's got court tomorrow.

220
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,524
- Yeah?
- Be there.

221
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,247
Am I late?

222
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,442
The judge called an early recess.

223
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,808
It could be fifteen minutes or so.

224
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,003
- Right. Yeah. So we've got time.
- There's my boyfriend, Raffie...

225
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,603
He looks friendly.

226
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,001
He doesn't like seeing me with other men.

227
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,447
And there is the little bitch.

228
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,524
Russell Dodson.

229
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,925
Be right back.

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,211
So, Dodson. Gary Webb,
San Jose Mercury News.

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,924
- You always follow people into bathrooms?
- No. Not really.

232
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,730
So why is the local news
interested in this case?

233
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,884
I'm not.

234
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,210
But I am interested in Danilo Blandon.

235
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,329
Never heard of him.

236
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,408
Then why is he on your witness list?

237
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,770
You had this guy cold on major
narcotics trafficking

238
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,365
and you let him walk.

239
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,726
Why?

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,602
I have his grand jury transcript.

241
00:13:59,760 --> 00:13:59,965
I know.

242
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,165
I've seen some screw ups outta
you guys but boy is that a big one.

243
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,282
So what's the story? Feds use
a bad guy to catch other bad guy?

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,210
- Do you even know what you have there?
- Yes, I know what this is.

245
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,521
Well, it's unheard of. It's a gift.

246
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,965
And I asked around about Danilo Blandon.

247
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,242
- No one has seemed-...
- We're talking here.

248
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,688
I'm telling you...

249
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,242
...whatever I got near,
it made him very nervous.

250
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,366
I know what I saw.

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,602
- And I've been doing this a long time,
- okay? So -

252
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,081
Don't do old and wise. I hate that.

253
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,440
I'm not old.

254
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,125
Come on. It's why you brought me in here.

255
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,440
To go after stories like this.

256
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,444
- But we're not the LA Times.
- We're not small-time, either.

257
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,921
There's more here, I promise you.

258
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,609
Get more info on Blandon
and then we'll take it to Jerry.

259
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,404
I gotta get back to San Jose.

260
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,210
Okay.

261
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,808
Hello, hello!

262
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,970
Smells good.

263
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,885
Who's Coral?

264
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,044
She's hot.

265
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,884
She drove a Camaro.

266
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,610
Of course she did.

267
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,211
She left this?

268
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,569
- Eat it.
- Mom, can we start?

269
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,008
- Yes.
- Yes. That looks so good.

270
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,448
- Yummy.
- Hello, gents.

271
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,281
- Hi.
- Why does she know where you live?

272
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,731
I don't know.

273
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,761
- She's a source.
- Yeah? For a story about strippers?

274
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,360
No. But that's a good one, though.

275
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,089
Drug dealers.

276
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,367
Okay. That's better.

277
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,924
Is it happening again?

278
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,770
- No.
- Is what happening again?

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,081
Come on.

280
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,922
Nothing.

281
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,088
- What's in the box?
- Eat your food.

282
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,371
- What happened with her?
- Nothing.

283
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,090
What happened with her?

284
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,090
Nothing.

285
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,290
I mean, I'm not going to do this again.
It's why we left my family, my friends...

286
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,971
- I know, I know.
- ...left Cleveland, moved out to California,

287
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,922
which I hate...

288
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,123
...all this stupid sunshine and shiny happy faces...

289
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,925
- Sunshine is so dumb. It's terrible.
- I'm being serious.

290
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,241
I know; well so am I.

291
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,200
Baby...

292
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,684
I'm not going to screw this up.

293
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,285
Understand?

294
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,404
Don't smile.

295
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,009
She said there's another hearing tomorrow.
Seriously, I fucking hate you.

296
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,889
I love you.

297
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,451
...dismiss all charges against Mr.Cornejo.

298
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,889
We are no longer proceeding
with the case, you Honor.

299
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,406
Hey.

300
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,931
Hi.

301
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,081
So what's going on?

302
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,766
I don't know. They've
been up there for a while.

303
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,248
The charges against Mr,
Cornejo are dismissed.

304
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,163
You are free to go.

305
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,690
What?

306
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,971
Very impressive, Gary Webb.

307
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,565
What just happened?

308
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,768
You terrified them.

309
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,851
They just stuffed
Danilo Blandon under a rug.

310
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,925
He's off their witness list.
No Blandon, no case.

311
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,648
Raffie walks.

312
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,771
Hey, hey, hey-

313
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,242
So you used me to get this
fucking case dropped?

314
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,368
I'm just the bimbo, remember?

315
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,241
Yeah, fuck you.

316
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,607
Be happy, Gary Webb.

317
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,921
You thought you were
getting a piece of cheese,

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,241
but I just gave you the mouse.

319
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,125
There's your story.

320
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,204
Danilo Blandon.

321
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,610
West coast...

322
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,251
Sorry about the air conditioning.

323
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,691
Come on in.

324
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,921
- How you doing?
- Pretty well.

325
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,411
You represent Ricky Ross,
the crack dealer?

326
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,003
Alleged crack dealer.

327
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,682
“Freeway Ricky Ross.
Biggest dealer in Los Angeles...

328
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,560
...the epicenter of the national
crack epidemic" L.A. Times.

329
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,080
Who do you write for?

330
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,242
- San Jose Mercury News.
- Never heard of them.

331
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,727
Russell Dodson is the
prosecutor on your case?

332
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,450
That's public record. Yes.

333
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,523
What about Danilo Blandon?

334
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,250
- Maybe.
- Because I think he's going to testify

335
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,327
gainst your client tomorrow.

336
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,085
No, you've got that backwards.

337
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,363
Blandon and my client
are friends and associates.

338
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,922
If he's going to testify,
he'll be testifying for Ricky.

339
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,930
That would be awkward.

340
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,605
Why's that?

341
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,609
Because he's a government informant.

342
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
That's bullshit.

343
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,803
I have a Grand Jury transcript
released on discovery by mistake...

344
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,410
...by our Russell Dodson.

345
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,161
In it is evidence of Blandon testifying
against other drug dealers.

346
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,445
Goddammit!

347
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,602
Jesus, does that make sense.

348
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,968
You would not believe the horseshit
that Dodson puts me through...

349
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,082
...every time I ask him who
his secret weapon is.

350
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,087
Well it's not just Ricky,

351
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,170
it's probably half a dozen guys
he's going to testify against-

352
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,561
Fuck me! They block me!

353
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,404
Every time I ask for something.

354
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,726
Claiming - get this -

355
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,609
National Security.

356
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,809
National security and crack
cocaine in the same sentence?

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,809
Does that not sound strange to you?

358
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,361
Ok, what exactly do you want?

359
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,241
Who's this?

360
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,210
He's a reporter.

361
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,848
So what do you know about Danilo Blandon?

362
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,443
I don't know him.

363
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,969
Come on Ricky. Danilo's going
to testify against you tomorrow.

364
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,321
He's the witness they've been hiding.

365
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,403
Man, there ain't no way
they flipped Danilo!

366
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,609
Sit down, and listen to what he has to say.

367
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,850
They didn't flip anyone.

368
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,370
Ricky,

369
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,250
Blandon was working for
the government the entire time.

370
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,368
- You for real?
- Yeah.

371
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,363
He for real?

372
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,882
Blandon a snitch?

373
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,083
Look here, man,
he was a thousand time heavier than

374
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,082
I'll ever be.

375
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,891
He's LA, New York, Atlanta,
He's everywhere.

376
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,201
I couldn't sell it fast enough
to keep up with supply.

377
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,044
- Slow down.
- Wait. You mean demand.

378
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,770
No. I mean supply.

379
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,161
I was buying a hundred kilos a week.

380
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,208
Selling three million dollars a day.

381
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,408
And still couldn't get rid of
that inventory fast enough, man.

382
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
It was raining coke.

383
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,209
- Allegedly, Ricky.
- Allegedly.

384
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,611
Allegedly.

385
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,687
Look here, man. I gave him...

386
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,765
...six million a week. Allegedly.

387
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,568
- That's impossible.
- Is it?

388
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,607
- I'm exaggerating, Fenster?
- Yeah, I hope so.

389
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,808
How do you sell that much
cocaine on the street?

390
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,604
Look here, man, we used to cook it.

391
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,920
With baking soda.

392
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,249
We called it Ready Rock.
Powder was for rich folks.

393
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,010
Holy shit.

394
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,242
Look here, man, I was just the elf.
Blandon was Santa Claus.

395
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,927
This is where Ricky ran his operation.

396
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,689
No, don't get out of the car!

397
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,003
Are you out of your fucking mind?

398
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,561
How did this happen?

399
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,086
Exactly. Which is why we're
going to get the hell out of here.

400
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,766
What about this doesn't piss you off?

401
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,526
It's complicated for me.

402
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,921
Whatever the hell happened,
all this shit has run downhill,

403
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,081
right here.

404
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,529
I need to speak with Blandon.

405
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,761
He's a protected witness.
How are you going to do that?

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,963
Yes, I know. I can't.

407
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,888
But you can.

408
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,051
<i>Mr. Blandon.</i>

409
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,927
During the years when you
were acting as a paid

410
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,565
informant of the U.S. government.

411
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,090
The years you say you wholesaled cocaine
to my client in Los Angeles...

412
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,440
...was the government aware that you were

413
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,251
smuggling tons of cocaine
into the United States.

414
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,330
Objection. Relevance. Inflammatory.

415
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,402
The government called this witness,
your honor.

416
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,086
He is a paid confidential informant.

417
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,243
The jury has a right to know
the scope of his expertise.

418
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,683
Overruled.

419
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,082
- Approach, your honor?
- Later.

420
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,165
Mr. Blandon?

421
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,241
Yes.

422
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,129
- Yes what?
- The government knew.

423
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,449
- Knew everything?
- Objection. Speculation.

424
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,568
Sustained.

425
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,046
Mr. Blandon...

426
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,602
...how much money did you
take in from cocaine sales

427
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,365
while you were working
for the U.S. government?

428
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,091
One and a half billion dollars.

429
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
That's correct.

430
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,164
What did you do with that money?

431
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,610
We made so much money we had to keep an
apartment just to keep the cash.

432
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,966
It was floor to ceiling dollars.

433
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,641
We had to rotate the money
from the top to the bottom...

434
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,765
...to prevent mold from
coming on the money from

435
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,767
the humidity.

436
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,648
What the fuck does this say?

437
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,808
Did he have a partner
or a government agency he

438
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,570
was working with?

439
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,407
Mr. Blandon, were you working
with a partner at that time?

440
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,607
Yes.

441
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,329
Norwin Meneses.

442
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,765
That's correct.

443
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,161
Wait a second, what exactly
is happening here, your honor?

444
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,329
Clearly, this reporter
is giving direction to counsel.

445
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,448
- Approach.
- Thank you.

446
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,603
Your honor, this man
in the first row is a reporter

447
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,284
and he's giving questions to counsel.

448
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,243
If he is, and I'm not saying that he is...

449
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,243
Well, he is.

450
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,608
Ok, he is. But there's nothing in
the rules that says he can't.

451
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,886
I don't like it.

452
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,962
But I'm not going to stop it.
For now.

453
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,970
Then I am compelled to warn
the court that this door leads to

454
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,526
very sensitive national security matters.

455
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,887
Then maybe you shouldn't
have opened it.

456
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,771
Mr. Blandon, is it true
that you and Norwin Meneses...

457
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,765
...were in communication with
the federal government together?

458
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,401
Can you tell us who in the
federal government you

459
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,130
were in communication with?

460
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,924
Who were you working with?

461
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,804
The FBI?

462
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,164
Mr. Dodson can't answer
that question for you, Mr. Blandon.

463
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,761
Remember, you're under oath.

464
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,602
The DEA?

465
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,803
No.

466
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,207
It was the CIA.

467
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,045
The Central Intelligence Agency.

468
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,602
Yes.

469
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,447
So, Mr. Blandon...

470
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,447
...what did the CIA have you do?

471
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,204
Objection! Relevance, your honor!

472
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,762
Overruled. Mr. Blandon,
answer the question.

473
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,562
We were asked to support...

474
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,608
...a free and democratic Nicaragua
- the Contras...

475
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,250
...the rebels...

476
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,207
...by sending planes into
Nicaragua and raising money here

477
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,760
in the U.S. for the war.

478
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,929
Mr. Blandon...

479
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,526
...did the CIA specifically know
that you were selling cocaine...

480
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,604
...to buy guns and supplies
to support its cause?

481
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,890
Objection! This line of
questioning has absolutely no relevance.

482
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
Overruled.

483
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,687
They knew who we were.

484
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,327
Why else would they come to us?

485
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,610
<i>The day Ronald Reagan got elected,
the Cubans and the Soviets started triggering...</i>

486
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,041
...revolutions all over
South and Central America.

487
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,406
And when they got Nicaragua...

488
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,005
...that put them fifty miles
from the Panama Canal.

489
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,445
Reagan drew the line in the sand.

490
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,160
And that's where America was
going to win the Cold War. Except...

491
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,040
...Congress hated Reagan's guts,
so they wanted nothing to do with him.

492
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,765
They were never going to
fund his little Contra war.

493
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,611
So the White House needed money.
Lots and lots of money.

494
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,727
Guys, that's the eighties.

495
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,722
It's ten year old news.
What's the story?

496
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,403
Jerry, just let him finish.

497
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,726
Look, one of the DEA's most wanted
- not only not in jail for eternity...

498
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,370
...but apparently
on the government payroll.

499
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,602
Admitting in open court
that he brought in thousands

500
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,200
of kilos of cocaine to the US every day.

501
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,122
For them.

502
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,889
For who?

503
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,371
The US government.
Or with them.

504
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,727
Or at least while
they were looking the other way.

505
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,762
Jesus.

506
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,763
That little stunt
you pulled in that courtroom...

507
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,889
I got complaints
from Justice in Sacramento and Washington.

508
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,041
Yeah, but I got Blandon.

509
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,246
Jerry.

510
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,331
This is the biggest
story the Merc's ever had.

511
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,768
That's what worries me.
A lot of blind spots, you know?

512
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,247
We don't know Washington.
We don't do International.

513
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,202
We do now.

514
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,170
We do, do we? How many
CIA sources to you have?

515
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,242
- None yet.
- Get one.

516
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,524
What are they saying officially?

517
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,371
They're not even calling me back.

518
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,330
Holy shit.

519
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,646
Gary...

520
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,604
You get some sources on the record,
see where we're at.

521
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,330
Watch your ass.

522
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,242
<i>The success of Communism in
Central America poses the threat...</i>

523
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,570
<i>...that a hundred million people from Panama
to the open border at our south...</i>

524
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,723
<i>...could come under the control
of pro-Soviet regimes.</i>

525
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,888
<i>If we cut off the freedom fighters...</i>

526
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,124
<i>...we will be giving the Soviets
a free hand in Central America.</i>

527
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,089
Mr.Meneses?

528
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,925
Hi. Gary Webb. How are you?

529
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,449
Ok. What took you so long?

530
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,404
How's that?

531
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,040
No other reporter
has ever tried to find me.

532
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,088
Are you a friend, Mr. Webb?

533
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,084
Because your country
is no longer a friend of mine.

534
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,284
I'm not an enemy.

535
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,800
You play golf?

536
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,250
Hockey.

537
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,287
Step into my parlor.

538
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,245
The five iron.

539
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,762
A perfectly designed club.

540
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,086
In golf, if you have a five iron,
you don't need anything else.

541
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,926
If you use it, like a tool.
You can carve any shot in the game.

542
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,561
You can even slice a man open
if you know how to use it properly.

543
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,401
So, guns for drugs...

544
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,242
You know, it's easy to think that
this situation was only about drugs.

545
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,761
But you need to look at
it from our point of view.

546
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,083
If the Contra movement would
have no friends and no money...

547
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,766
...we would have been forced to live under
a government that tells you what to say,

548
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,247
what not to say, what to think,
what not to think.

549
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,527
If you were me,
would you sit still and watch as your

550
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,089
children are forced...

551
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,969
...to live a life of
irrelevance and servitude?

552
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,089
And you watched
from the deck of your yacht?

553
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,525
My yacht?

554
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,764
Norwin, you were arrested for trafficking
narcotics for the first time in 1975.

555
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,127
That's ten years before the Contra war.

556
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,444
Come on, you're not a freedom fighter.

557
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,082
I thought you were my friend.

558
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,004
Just looking for the truth.

559
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,889
Well you're gonna get the truth.

560
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,122
You got someone else down here
I could talk to?

561
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,891
I can introduce you to my banker, Mr. Baier.

562
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,564
I'd like that.

563
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,928
Come, I show you the airstrip now.

564
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,605
<i>So when did all of this start?</i>

565
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,247
They were always looking
for ways to raise money to fight this war.

566
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,242
There was this one time when Ollie...

567
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,440
Ollie went to his friends in Washington,

568
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,888
- and this is years ago-
- Oliver North?

569
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,371
Oliver North.

570
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,325
No, Oliver Hardy. Yes, Oliver North.

571
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,847
So he said why don't we use the cash
seized from the cocaine arrests...

572
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,287
...to fund and support the Contra war?

573
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,050
Of course, they declined you know.

574
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,167
But as you can see,

575
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,403
Ollie wasn't the only
person with ideas like this.

576
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,245
<i>Did it have to be drugs?</i>

577
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,722
The ends justify the means.

578
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,446
Yeah, write that down.

579
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,250
You Americans don't
want coconuts or bananas.

580
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,091
You want cocaine,
and I know where to find cocaine.

581
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,728
<i>And my pilots were already flying
from Central America to the United States.</i>

582
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,404
<i>And they were American.</i>

583
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,289
How long ago was this shut down?

584
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,246
Eight to ten years ago.

585
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,682
The land is now privately owned.

586
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,249
If I was in the CIA and I was risking my life
overseas doing something illegal...

587
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,766
...believe me, I would want someone
like me to help do the job.

588
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,442
Write this name down: Fred Weil.

589
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,364
W-E-I-L

590
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,603
That's the guy you have to talk to.

591
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,640
What was stored here?

592
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,730
Weapons. Cash.

593
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,531
Lots and lots of cash.

594
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,409
These pilots, do you know their names?

595
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,403
I don't know.

596
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,480
Now that you know the truth,
you will be faced with the

597
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,363
most important decision of your life.

598
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,090
Oh yeah. What's that?

599
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,888
Deciding whether to share it or not.

600
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,367
You have a family? You married?

601
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,969
Like I said.

602
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,801
The pilots used little airstrips
in Florida, Arizona, California.

603
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,331
Come.

604
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,370
I'll take care of it.

605
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,360
Down on your knees.
Keep your head down.

606
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,321
Don't answer that.

607
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,889
Passport.

608
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,401
Yes, we have to go now.
We're leaving.

609
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,801
Nice and calm.

610
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,929
Nice and calm.

611
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,162
You're where?

612
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,242
I'm in DC. And look, don't worry.

613
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,088
You want me here.

614
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,361
Trust me on this, Anna.

615
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,407
The guys are getting nervous.

616
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,681
You're supposed to be back here.

617
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,604
<i>Look, I changed planes in Miami.
I kept all my receipts.</i>

618
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,042
I'll pay for my own damn flight back
home if I have to, all right?

619
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,928
We can't do this on the phone,

620
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,968
and I don't want
to do this on the phone.

621
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,367
Look, I've got to go.

622
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,686
Fred Weil?

623
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,768
Gary Webb, San Jose Mercury-News.

624
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,247
I don't talk to the press.
Call Public Affairs.

625
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,723
I spoke to Norwin Meneses.

626
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,683
That's classified. How did you get it?

627
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,963
Got it from a drug dealer.

628
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,846
Perfect.

629
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,004
Listen, I was John Kerry's lead investigator on
the senate subcommittee that investigated this.

630
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,289
You have no idea
what you're getting into.

631
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,687
Why don't you tell me?

632
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,364
Tell me what I'm getting into.

633
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,403
I'm on the National
Security Council now.

634
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,246
And I have the trust
of the President and his cabinet.

635
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,887
It took me ten years
to get back to that place.

636
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,361
Your name goes nowhere near this.

637
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,969
This conversation never happened.
You have my word on that.

638
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,120
You ever done anything like this before?

639
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,361
No.

640
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,646
Has your paper?

641
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,091
Not that I'm aware of.

642
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,607
Some fancy information that you have there.

643
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,810
And dangerous.

644
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,968
I'd be remiss if I didn't
tell you that other reporters

645
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,890
have been down this rabbit hole.

646
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,804
Seasoned reporters.
Who knew their way around Washington.

647
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
And Central America.

648
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,440
- So what are you telling me?
- I had an American citizen...

649
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,764
...a rich Republican Party fund-raiser,
a White House favorite, in my office..

650
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,683
...upset about things he was hearing.

651
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,764
He believed in freedom
and defeating communism...

652
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,764
...but not in laundering
narcotics money for guns.

653
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,526
And he's sitting
in my office in the U.S. Senate...

654
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,447
...and he gets a phone call
telling him that if he talked to me...

655
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,125
...he'd die.

656
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,323
This is your ticket out of small time,
right?

657
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,366
- You're going to make your bones on this.
- This is a true story

658
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,330
My friend, some stories
are just too true to tell.

659
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,570
That's bullshit.

660
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,846
Yeah?

661
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,609
And yes, it is.

662
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,888
Congratulations.
You figured that out.

663
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,363
“Too true to tell.”

664
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,602
<i>Welcome to San Francisco
International airport.</i>

665
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,160
<i>Please do not leave your bags unattended.</i>

666
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,770
Sometimes I wish I could just climb
inside that head of yours

667
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,521
...and see all the shit you carry around.

668
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,090
Really?

669
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,925
No. Not really.

670
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,409
There's too many bad guys.

671
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,410
And ghosts.

672
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,451
And scary monsters running around.

673
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,122
Well, what do you want me to do,
Sue? Do something else for a living?

674
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,761
No.

675
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,250
This one just scares me.

676
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Be careful.

677
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,241
Hey.

678
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
Yeah.

679
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,645
Jesus.

680
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,921
Hello?

681
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,769
<i>It's Russell Dodson.</i>

682
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,130
Hello, Russell Dodson.

683
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,403
<i>Listen, we haven't
handled this right at all.</i>

684
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,847
<i>Before you print anything,
there's a few guys from</i>

685
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,241
<i>D.C. that would like
to sit down with you.</i>

686
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,689
<i>You should hear them out.</i>

687
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,325
I'm listening.

688
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,361
Gary.

689
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,045
Thanks for coming.

690
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,771
I'm Agent Miller,
and this is Agent Jones.

691
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,765
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No.

692
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,288
How about one of those cappuccinos?

693
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,610
Just got a new espresso machine probably
cost the tax payers thirty grand.

694
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,251
No, I'm fine.

695
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,884
Get him a cappuccino.

696
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,928
Now we don't agree
with everything that happens in

697
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,646
our agencies, so this
is a little awkward for us.

698
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,048
But you're getting
into some sensitive areas.

699
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,170
There are ongoing operations
you're in danger of exposing.

700
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,411
Operations that have taken months,
years to set up.

701
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,769
Thousands of man hours,
millions to fund.

702
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,090
And how do you know that?

703
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,923
We know you were in Nicaragua.
We know you saw Meneses.

704
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,810
Am I being followed?

705
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
What's your angle, Webb?

706
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,926
Some governmental informants are scumbags?

707
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,970
Look, I was under the impression that
you guys had something to say to me?

708
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,923
But, to answer your question, no.

709
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,168
My angle is that the
American government knew drugs were

710
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,402
put on the streets
to fund an illegal war.

711
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,603
What you want to say happened,
never happened.

712
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,169
Then why am I here?

713
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,925
American kids...

714
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,764
...were going to die in that war.

715
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,890
American kids did die.
They're still dying.

716
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,606
Just not the ones you care about,
apparently.

717
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,611
We'd never threaten your children, Mr. Webb.

718
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,409
My children?

719
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,329
What did you say?

720
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,764
I'm writing the story.

721
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,844
Okay. I'm about to press “send”.

722
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,646
<i>We're ready. All hands on deck.</i>

723
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,410
Don't over-edit it.

724
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,160
<i>Don't worry.</i>

725
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,880
Anna.

726
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,447
<i>Gary. I got it.</i>

727
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,242
<i>Go enjoy your family.</i>

728
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,882
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

729
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,566
All right last one in is a rotten egg!

730
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,444
Is it cold or warm?

731
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,442
- It's warm.
- Ready?

732
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,648
All right; precious cargo.

733
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,811
Dizzy yet?

734
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,046
- No.
- Okay.

735
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,202
Come on, Momma!

736
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,362
- Come on, Mom, get in.
- Why do they gang up on momma?

737
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,161
- You have to dry my hair!
- Where you going, Dad?

738
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,648
- Dad...
- Don't!

739
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,928
Dad, it's up! It's online!

740
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,526
Mom!

741
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,602
Oh my god, Mom, check this out.
It just went up. It's everywhere.

742
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,448
Gary!

743
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,726
For the better part of a decade,

744
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,531
a San Francisco Bay-area
drug ring sold tons of cocaine...

745
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,809
...to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of
Los Angeles and funneled millions...

746
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,446
...in drug profits to
Latin American guerrilla army run

747
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,965
by the US Central Intelligence Agency...

748
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,003
...a Mercury news investigation has found.

749
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,720
This drug network opened the first
pipeline between Columbia and...

750
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,081
Hey.

751
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,250
Hey.

752
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,690
You did it.

753
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,604
Yeah.

754
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,962
Want to go fool around in the woods?

755
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,882
Yeah.

756
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,611
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, I do.

757
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,641
- Don't look, don't look.
- Hey, come on!

758
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,082
<i>You should see our switchboard!
It is lit up like a Christmas tree!</i>

759
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,162
<i>We're getting calls
from all over the world. Gary.</i>

760
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,685
What do you want to do?

761
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,240
Well, it's just the beginning,
isn't it?

762
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,089
I think there's more to do.

763
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,567
<i>Got to keep riding out the story.
Keep digging.</i>

764
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,448
Anything you need.

765
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,762
Okay? But take a victory lap.

766
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,042
<i>Hey, that graphic you guys used?</i>

767
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,691
The crack pipe on the CIA emblem?

768
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,722
Are you out of your mind?

769
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,723
It's like the CIA is cooking
crack in their basement.

770
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,009
Gary. That was my idea,
so blame me, but come on.

771
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,650
We got their attention, didn't we?

772
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,081
We're just calling
to say thanks for doing this.

773
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,643
<i>- There is a lot of pride here this morning.
- Congratulations, buddy.</i>

774
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,091
Hey. Gary.

775
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,525
<i>Yeah?</i>

776
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,085
You did it.

777
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,804
<i>This is the big one.</i>

778
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,129
<i>Enjoy yourself!</i>

779
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,128
Let's focus on the Washington Post,
New York Times and the LA Times.

780
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,049
And get Richard
Zuckerman on the phone.

781
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,846
What interests me is who is gonna tell me
how we missed this goddamned story.

782
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,684
How'd the San Jose Mercury News,

783
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,604
a paper one-fifth the size
of the Los Angeles Times...

784
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,609
...and three hundred
miles away-scooped us...

785
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,846
...on one of the most
important stories in this city in,

786
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,127
in what? Twenty years?

787
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,527
How about you, Rich?
Didn't you cover Ricky Ross?

788
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,250
- Parts of it.
- Yeah, apparently the wrong parts.

789
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,840
We had Blandon in one of our stories.

790
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,524
- As what?
- A government source.

791
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,761
He's also apparently almost single-handedly

792
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,609
responsible for the crack epidemic.

793
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,131
Which, by the way, started right here...

794
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,086
...in Watts,
five fucking miles from where we're sitting.

795
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,167
Look, I don't need to tell you this...

796
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,325
...but if this story stands,
some of your people are going to jail.

797
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,846
<i>The idea that any one person
could have played a decisive</i>

798
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,170
<i>role in the crack epidemic...</i>

799
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,687
- ...is absurd.
- <i>What about Norwin Meneses?</i>

800
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,249
We have no documentation...

801
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,971
<i>...that this guy ever
did any business with us.</i>

802
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,321
This Gary Webb, he's got nothing.

803
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,324
<i>He's got drug dealers and
money launderers as sources.</i>

804
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,448
Rich, you know this guy Webb.
What do you think?

805
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,250
It's thin.

806
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,248
Except that he posted all
his sources on the Merc website.

807
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,163
- So?
- So nobody's done that before.

808
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,449
I need every line of that story taken
apart and checked for inaccuracies.

809
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,648
Get Dominic Brady
back here from Washington.

810
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,162
- I want at least fifteen people on this thing.
- What if we're over reacting?

811
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,049
I mean, it's the San Jose Mercury News.

812
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,407
Is anyone even going to pay attention?

813
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,923
<i>A reporter for the
San Jose Mercury News suggested...</i>

814
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,606
<i>...that the CIA might have played a role...</i>

815
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,967
<i>...in permitting Nicaraguan
drug dealers to distribute...</i>

816
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,807
<i>...crack cocaine in south central
Los Angeles during the 1980's.</i>

817
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,244
That had enormous resonance within
the African-American community.

818
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,160
We have been faked out,
we have been tricked,

819
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,049
and we have been undermined.

820
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,090
If they had put that crack
in Beverly Hills,

821
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,328
it would be a presidential issue.

822
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,609
We love our children.
Just like you love yours.

823
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,126
I think it is enough information here...

824
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,926
...to say to the CIA,
you stand accused.

825
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,561
<i>President Clinton will be back out
on the campaign trail next week -</i>

826
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,849
I've got...

827
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,766
...requests for you from CNN, CNBC...

828
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,283
...Jerry Springer,
Geraldo Rivera and Montel Williams.

829
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,286
The London Times and Le Monde
are sending in to interview you...

830
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,768
...and Sixty Minutes
and Dateline both want you, but

831
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,285
only if you don't do the other one.

832
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,926
And I just got the call last night...

833
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,961
...the National Press
Association Journalist of the Year...

834
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,082
...is Mr. Gary Webb.

835
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,611
Congratulations. Gary.

836
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,406
On, baby!

837
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,363
Thank you.

838
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,124
Life's beautiful.

839
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,443
<i>It's checking out Richard.
I spoke with the banker in Panama City.</i>

840
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,082
<i>His name is Hans Yorg Baier.
He met with Webb. He confirmed...</i>

841
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,521
...he laundered drug money for the Contras.

842
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,409
<i>Norwin Meneses was his client.</i>

843
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,927
Are these sources reliable enough?
For the Post?

844
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,764
I mean, they're all drug dealers.

845
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,644
The banker isn't a drug dealer.

846
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,685
<i>Also, there's this American ex-pat that had
a ranch in the jungle for thirty years.</i>

847
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,526
<i>And he let these two American pilots
land and take off from his airstrip.</i>

848
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,604
And, he let them store
dope on his property.

849
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,720
You're talking to drug
dealers and money launderers.

850
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,649
I'm talking to Langley.

851
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,886
<i>Well, I'm filing.</i>

852
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,928
You guys do whatever you want with it.

853
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,931
So what's our point of view?

854
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,520
That Webb doesn't have any
legitimate sources...

855
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,082
That the CIA would never use these
low-lifes and in fact denies it,

856
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,480
in fact denies it unequivocally.

857
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,604
That basically, he's a
fraud and so is his story.

858
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,927
'll take that upstairs
and see if it'll fly.

859
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,241
Yeah, you're going to turn into a chip.

860
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,725
Hey, wait you guys, it's on.

861
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,404
Come here, it's on.

862
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,450
<i>In tonight's Eye on America,
accusations...</i>

863
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,251
<i>...underscore the word

864
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,800
<i>...short of explosive.
hat the CIA...</i>

865
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,324
<i>...knowingly and intentionally did what amounts
to pump crack cocaine into Los Angeles...</i>

866
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,322
That's not what he said.

867
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,925
<i>...to help fund rebels in Nicaragua.</i>

868
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,166
You never said “intentionally.”

869
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,403
<i>Whether or not these claims prove true,
they anger they...</i>

870
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,045
<i>A lot of people are saying...</i>

871
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,327
...of course,
including people in Congress...

872
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,123
that the CIA intentionally addicted
African Americans to crack cocaine.

873
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,687
Right. Well, what you and others are
doing is putting words in my mouth.

874
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,966
We never made that claim.

875
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,687
<i>What have you got to prove that
Americans working in the US government...</i>

876
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,206
<i>...collaborated in selling
crack cocaine into the</i>

877
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,011
<i>African American community of Los Angeles?</i>

878
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,243
<i>Well, first of all, we never
said that Americans working</i>

879
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,680
<i>in the government were doing this.</i>

880
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,326
<i>These were Nicaraguans
working for the CIA-run army.</i>

881
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,449
<i>Okay. It's not CIA-U.S. officials.</i>

882
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,681
<i>Not that we know so far.</i>

883
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,683
<i>Okay. It's not U.S. officials.
Okay. Go ahead.</i>

884
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,322
What the CIA wanted to do was to fight
a war that Congress didn't want.

885
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,606
And the ripple effect of that

886
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,529
- what happened in south Los Angeles
and other American cities

887
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,204
- well that was a mistake.

888
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,362
This is a smoking cannon...

889
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,762
...that leads all the
way to the White House.

890
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,605
<i>We have no evidence...</i>

891
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,444
...of a conspiracy by the CIA...

892
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,251
...to engage in encouraging
drug traffickers in Nicaragua...

893
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,249
I am going to make somebody...

894
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:03,207
...pay for what they have done
to my community and to my people.

895
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,044
Don't give me the conspiracy bull -

896
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,648
There has never been
a conspiracy in this country.

897
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,441
Senior Baier...

898
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,921
Hello?

899
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,764
It's Fred Weil.

900
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,208
You haven't seen the east coast papers yet?

901
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,406
No.

902
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,204
It's 4 AM.

903
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,282
I was you once. Gary,

904
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,642
<i>I started down this road.
Though nowhere near as far as you are.</i>

905
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,409
<i>When they saw...</i>

906
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,689
...I wasn't gonna stop, they
'controversialized' me.

907
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,322
<i>Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?</i>

908
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,721
<i>They make you the story.</i>

909
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,525
<i>And you have a history of schizophrenia,
you're a liar, you're a homo...</i>

910
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,523
...you beat your dog...

911
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,283
...you're a pedophile -

912
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,402
it doesn't matter if none of it's true.
The point is...

913
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,922
<i>...no one remembers what you found.
They remember you...</i>

914
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,723
<i>...and you're nuts.</i>

915
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,049
<i>You cease to exist.</i>

916
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,410
<i>You there?</i>

917
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,969
Yeah, I'm here.

918
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,321
<i>Remember, you get the most flak...</i>

919
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,366
<i>...when you're right above the target.</i>

920
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,889
<i>That's when they empty
all their guns into you.</i>

921
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,521
<i>When you're about
to drop a bomb on the on the Kremlin...</i>

922
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,291
<i>Or in this case,
the Central Intelligence Agency.</i>

923
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,763
<i>Hang in there. Gary.</i>

924
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,086
Morning.

925
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,371
You guys don't look so good.

926
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
Morning, Gary.

927
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,885
Good morning.

928
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,610
We just want to take your temperature,
you know, get

929
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,001
your perspective before we weigh in here.

930
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,647
About what?

931
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,764
Well, the CIA's response to you for one.

932
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,042
Well, there isn't one really, is there?

933
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,606
Still nothing?

934
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,722
Not a single source? I mean

935
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,449
...at this point,

936
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,843
I'll take anybody who takes home
a check from the CIA. Anyone.

937
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,524
They're a secretive organization,

938
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,251
Jerry. I mean, that's what they do.
They're secretive. They don't talk.

939
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,480
Well, at least the Washington
Post isn't saying we got

940
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,522
all our facts wrong.

941
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,761
Because they're not.

942
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,565
But what the Post is saying is that
we're just here to attest to the moral

943
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,246
purity of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

944
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,721
Gary, Walter Zuckerman is a living legend.

945
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,610
Yeah, who thinks his job
is to defend the CIA.

946
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,801
He used to work for them.

947
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,924
He was a media intern for
god's sakes. Am I crazy?

948
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,606
I mean reading this stuff
is like reading Pravda circa 1953,

949
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,444
you guys. I mean,
what am I missing here?

950
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,366
Gary, cards on the table.
We got a call from Corporate this morning.

951
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,800
They are getting a little nervous.

952
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,047
And so we're just going to take a beat,
step back,

953
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,168
look at the big picture
on behalf of the paper.

954
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,130
We don't want to print anything else
until we get our ducks in a row, ok?

955
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,924
And we're keeping you in the loop.

956
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,762
No big deal

957
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,161
- Gary, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

958
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,005
I just got a call.

959
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,044
NBC's cancelling their segment on the
story. They're not gonna run it.

960
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,804
And you're not going to believe this,
but we've heard

961
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,570
the Washington Post is going
to say you're an active

962
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,449
part of Ricky Ross' defense...

963
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,284
...that your involvement verges
on complicity and that

964
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,324
you and Ricky Ross are telling
this fairy tale together.

965
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,889
- It's not funny.
- Come on.

966
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,281
- It's funny.
- No, our careers could be on the line.

967
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,448
Look, we drew blood.
They're going to say anything.

968
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,965
Would you?

969
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,886
What?

970
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,527
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

971
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,285
You think I'd make some shit up?

972
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,925
No.

973
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,443
- You're my editor.
- I know.

974
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,283
It's my name on this story but it's
your name on that damn door.

975
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,404
Don't forget that.

976
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,290
Right there.

977
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,691
It's Rich Kline.

978
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,730
<i>It's Gary Webb.</i>

979
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,090
Really?

980
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,888
Ok.

981
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,445
Hello?

982
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,284
What's happening here, Rich?

983
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,607
The only people you have in your story...

984
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,250
...is the former Director of the CIA,

985
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,681
the current Director
of the CIA and - guess who -

986
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,047
...a bunch of CIA officials.

987
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,204
<i>Are you following up on anything
I wrote or are you</i>

988
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,691
<i>just talking to the CIA?</i>

989
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,285
I can't be talking to you.

990
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,531
<i>Why?</i>

991
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,644
I don't know. I'm sorry.

992
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,648
Son of a bitch.

993
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,090
What the fuck.

994
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,766
Hey!

995
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,250
What the hell you doing?

996
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,850
I can see you!

997
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,285
Son of a bitch

998
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,646
Son of a bitch!

999
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,683
I saw him and I chased
him down the goddamned street.

1000
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,762
Ok, so then you tried to shoot the guy.

1001
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,969
I fired a warning shot.

1002
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,765
I have a family to protect.

1003
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,881
Did he try to break in?

1004
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,760
No. He was at the back of my car.
He wasn't trying to steal it.

1005
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,287
I don't know what the hell he was
doing but he was there.

1006
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,085
See his fingerprints or some shit.

1007
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,891
He was messing with it,
I don't know what he was doing.

1008
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,851
What are you doing?

1009
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,850
Do you have any reason to believe
your family's in danger, Mr. Webb?

1010
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,400
No.

1011
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,205
No.

1012
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,526
Dad!

1013
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,600
What is that?

1014
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,326
That's Ian.

1015
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,886
You can't - put that shit down.

1016
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,405
Hey dad! Dad!

1017
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,321
All these people just came down and
are looking through all your shit!

1018
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,690
Can I help you?

1019
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,682
You can't be in here.

1020
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,603
- It's a crime scene.
- It's not a crime scene.

1021
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,564
Excuse me, this is my house
- what are you doing?

1022
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,563
Who the fuck are you?

1023
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,564
Hey, will you put this down?
This is my shit! This is my house!

1024
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,608
Get the fuck out!

1025
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,170
Get the fuck out of here!

1026
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,770
Ian, anybody comes down here,
hit them with that.

1027
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,285
I see you!

1028
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,920
I know you had a hard night
last night but I need to warn you...

1029
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,122
before you come into work
tomorrow that the next week

1030
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,084
or so is going to be rough.

1031
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,728
Now Dateline thinks you lied to
them so they're coming after you.

1032
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,326
And so is Nightline,

1033
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,767
and every other major that
hasn't had their shot yet.

1034
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,050
Well, the story's tight.

1035
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,170
It's not perfect.

1036
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,084
Well, Jerry put the brakes on.
I need to keep going.

1037
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,402
I'm not done, Anna.

1038
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,404
And I need you to protect me so
I can finish what we started.

1039
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,922
It's not the story now.

1040
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,924
This is about you.

1041
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,921
The New York Times gave us a courtesy call.
They went into everything.

1042
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,008
Every closet and corner of your life.

1043
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,324
Every speeding ticket, every bar fight,
every libel suit

1044
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,765
That's gossip, that's not news.

1045
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,767
And now Jerry's talking
about you working out of the

1046
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,410
Cupertino office for a while.

1047
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,006
Jerry's out of his mind.
That's not happening.

1048
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,923
Hey bud, come on in.

1049
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,969
That's not a good idea.

1050
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,684
Ian, go to your room.

1051
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,205
What is this?

1052
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,682
They found out about that woman?

1053
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,725
The woman in Cleveland,
at the Plain Dealer.

1054
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,325
Yeah? And?

1055
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,722
Why didn't you tell us the whole story?

1056
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,241
What the fuck.

1057
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,003
Look, who I do or what the fuck I do in my life
is not your concern, you understand that?

1058
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,560
- This is between my wife and I, god -
- Excuse me.

1059
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,847
It's between my wife and I,
goddammit it's not your fucking concern.

1060
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,125
You can take any man's life,
put in under a microscope.

1061
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,289
You can dissect it, turn a simple
man's life into a circus sideshow,

1062
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,970
you know that.

1063
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,924
What about the rest of me?

1064
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,242
Can we focus on that?

1065
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,370
Dad, what happened in Cleveland?

1066
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,881
Come on.

1067
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,924
There's no such thing as
a little mistake, Ian.

1068
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,406
One wrong turn and you're lost.

1069
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,442
- Keep turning trying to get back-
- You sound like a writer, writing.

1070
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,004
I'm asking my father
what happened in Cleveland.

1071
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,930
I screwed up.

1072
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,650
Who was it?

1073
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,683
A reporter in the newsroom.

1074
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,809
What was her name?

1075
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,010
- Why does that matter?
- It matters to me.

1076
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,410
Barbara.

1077
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,004
Did you love her?

1078
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,610
No.

1079
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,809
Do you love mom?

1080
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,363
I love your mother.

1081
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,083
You, your brother, your sister,
your mother...

1082
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,925
You're everything to me.
You're all I got.

1083
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,288
I couldn't stand losing that.

1084
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,729
What happened to her?

1085
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,083
She committed suicide.

1086
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,850
That's really shitty.

1087
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,602
Yeah it was.

1088
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,208
Is that why we left Ohio?

1089
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,404
Because you ran away?

1090
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,560
Yeah, we needed a fresh start.

1091
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,251
God, I'm really disappointed in you.

1092
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,405
Mom's amazing.

1093
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,400
<i>We don't have a choice, Gary.
This is the only option</i>

1094
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,244
<i>on the table right now.</i>

1095
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,362
<i>Good for you to get out
of the line of fire for a beat.</i>

1096
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,411
<i>You can cool off, pop out
some easy human interest stuff.</i>

1097
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,689
Dad, what's in Cupertino?

1098
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,683
It's the paper's bureau for losers.

1099
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,285
Where I won't get in trouble.

1100
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,245
Or so they think.

1101
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,402
Maybe just don't go, Daddy.

1102
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:08,329
I know. But honey, Daddy's
got to go to work.

1103
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,448
We've got the house to pay for
and all these school clothes.

1104
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,568
You guys are growing like weeds.

1105
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,771
Look after them.

1106
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,765
You guys be good.

1107
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,050
Photos. Your old records.

1108
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,806
- Some of Christine's drawings.
- Ok.

1109
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,324
That kind of thing.

1110
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,251
I hate this.

1111
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,810
I know.

1112
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,644
I don't want to be alone.

1113
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,288
I'm no good at it, you know that.

1114
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,160
Maybe some time apart will be a good thing.

1115
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,729
Well, it's got to be.

1116
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,126
Ok.

1117
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,242
I love you, daddy.

1118
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,288
- Bye.
- Love you too.

1119
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,609
Love you, daddy!

1120
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,240
I was told that the
Police Department is having trouble

1121
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,641
keeping the troopers' horses healthy...

1122
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,408
Yeah, I hear it was bowel trouble?

1123
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,570
Constipation.

1124
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,126
I have you on record as working
in Nicaragua with John Cullen

1125
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,368
and Barry Reid between '81 and '85.

1126
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,171
<i>Yeah, I worked with Reid,
but I don't know Cullen.</i>

1127
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,242
You got any contact info for Reid?

1128
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,210
<i>Last I heard he was in New Orleans.
I think he died though.</i>

1129
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,726
I'd like to review your flight logs.
Names of pilots-

1130
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,325
<i>I can't do that, Mr. Webb.</i>

1131
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,050
Is there anyone else I can speak to?

1132
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,441
<i>I don't know, maybe if you try back
in a week you can talk to my boss.</i>

1133
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,090
Is Cullen residing in Lake City?

1134
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,931
<i>Down in Florida maybe? Look,
I can't talk to you.</i>

1135
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,566
You didn't even open the box I gave you.

1136
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,805
What? Oh honey, I can't open that.

1137
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,005
You can't?

1138
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,809
Look, I gotta focus.

1139
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,890
You understand? I gotta focus
so I can finish this thing.

1140
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,410
And then what happens?

1141
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,410
Then it's done.

1142
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,564
And then what?

1143
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,445
Then what? What? I didn't choose
what's happening here, Sue.

1144
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,251
I didn't choose this.
I don't want to fucking be here in

1145
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,164
this shitbox. Away from home.

1146
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,404
Come on. What is this?

1147
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,410
What do you mean?

1148
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,969
Can't you see what this
is doing to all of us?

1149
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,004
That's not fair.

1150
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,600
Look, you are who you always were, Gary.

1151
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,648
No regret...

1152
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,282
...no blame, no judgment, it's just a fact.

1153
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,081
I guess it's me who's changed.

1154
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,564
What are you saying?

1155
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,607
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

1156
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,605
You do know.

1157
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,604
Say it!

1158
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,329
I don't know.

1159
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,604
Don't turn on the light.

1160
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,723
I'm John Cullen.

1161
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,924
Do you know that name?

1162
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,408
What you found here, Gary, is a monster.

1163
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,605
I was recruited by the Agency...

1164
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,768
...out of college.

1165
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,931
I knew Spanish and Law...

1166
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,967
...and I wanted to do good.

1167
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,324
I wanted to fight some evil empire.

1168
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,651
I went to Central America.

1169
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,444
Made nice with radicals.

1170
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,566
Slept with some of the pretty ones.

1171
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,048
And turned in names.

1172
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:57,609
Then I started noticing
that they were disappearing.

1173
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,809
Permanently.

1174
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,767
The people that we hunted...

1175
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,608
Murdered...

1176
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,404
All they had...

1177
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:15,249
...was a deep desire to reform the
government and have free elections.

1178
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,728
That's it.

1179
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,525
After I left the Agency,

1180
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,285
I worked my way
into a major drug cartel.

1181
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,402
It was early Medellin.

1182
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,371
I solved logistical issues.

1183
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,248
Bringing supply into the United States.

1184
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,400
Paved the way, you might say...

1185
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,046
...as the traffic grew. And grew.

1186
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:49,163
Well someone in Washington knows what
you do and is doing nothing to stop it.

1187
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,766
It's all lies and corruption, Gary.

1188
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,686
You become attracted to the power,
then you become addicted to the power...

1189
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,331
...then you're devoured by the power.

1190
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,288
Your thing and my thing,
are they connected?

1191
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,650
Are they the same?

1192
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,561
Yes. They are the same.

1193
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,689
Danilo Blandon.

1194
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,765
This is him. Yesterday.

1195
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,606
This is you here. Today.

1196
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,603
Nobody wants to hear your sad story,
Gary.

1197
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,530
You can go on record.

1198
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,768
And end up dead?

1199
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,405
No.

1200
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,250
Then why are you here?

1201
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,245
I'm confessing.

1202
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,444
Who else am I going to tell?

1203
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,445
Anna?

1204
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,920
Who is it?

1205
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,685
It's Gary

1206
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,325
It's six in the morning.

1207
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,050
I found him. Or he found me.

1208
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,770
- Who?
- The asset.

1209
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,320
It's the piece I've been missing.
The only thing I didn't have.

1210
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,529
It's what you kept asking for.
So I can keep going.

1211
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:07,767
He was a part of the operation, Anna.
You understandthat? CIA.

1212
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,007
Look if I can just get him to go on record,

1213
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:12,888
he'll confirm everything.

1214
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,769
He came to my goddamned motel room.

1215
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,120
- I'm not finished with it.
- You gotta talk to Jerry about this.

1216
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,048
Calm down.

1217
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,281
I'm not finished!

1218
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,769
Look, I'm trying to keep you on the payroll,
ok? I'm trying to save your career.

1219
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,566
I know I'm not just gonna sit back
and be quiet and do nothing

1220
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,210
so I can collect your goddamn check.

1221
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,884
- I understand.
- You know that. You know me.

1222
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,200
I'm gonna keep going.

1223
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,611
I'm gonna finish this.

1224
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,604
For you.
Or I'm gonna do it for somebody else.

1225
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,840
Look, there's a staff meeting tomorrow.

1226
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,207
We'll talk about it there. OK?

1227
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,245
OK.

1228
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,563
OK.

1229
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,205
Morning, Gary.

1230
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,763
I wanted to run a couple
ideas past you guys.

1231
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,569
About this asset, the CIA asset.

1232
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,210
Gary, have a seat.

1233
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,565
- Hey Pete.
- Hey.

1234
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,085
When'd you get in from Washington?

1235
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,084
No easy way to say this,
Gary so I'm just going to say it.

1236
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,242
We've had Pete backtrack
a few of your leads.

1237
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,445
Why didn't you tell me?

1238
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,409
Well I'm telling you now.

1239
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,562
Pete, why didn't you say anything?

1240
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:11,201
We didn't like some of the some of the
stuff that Pete brought back, ok?

1241
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,601
Some of your sources
have changed their stories.

1242
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,761
Of course they did.

1243
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,401
Well, they're saying they never said
the things you have them saying.

1244
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,608
Well that's how they operate, Jerry.

1245
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,404
- “They"?
- The Agency.

1246
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,601
They deny everything.

1247
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,411
Everyone who works with the CIA,
the CIA denies everything.

1248
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,649
Did you ever get an actual
CIA operative on the record?

1249
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:30,842
We never made that claim.

1250
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,127
I think that's been
very clear at this point.

1251
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,402
Did you not tell them about
the guy who came to my hotel room?

1252
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,000
But he said he's not going
on the record, Gary.

1253
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,603
- No. I think I made-
- Did you get anyone who works

1254
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,087
for the CIA on the record?

1255
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,041
Who is this guy?

1256
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:45,928
Outside Counsel.

1257
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,283
OK, let me catch you up
to speed here, counselor.

1258
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,768
The CIA uses people who work for the CIA.

1259
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,161
They also use people who work with the CIA.

1260
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,048
You get the difference.

1261
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,771
We don't operate in a
courtroom or in absolutes, Gary.

1262
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,604
We operate in shades of grey.

1263
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,082
I didn't realize truth
was a shade of grey.

1264
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:03,604
Anyone else?

1265
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,802
It's not what you can prove,
it's what people say they remember.

1266
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,763
Your word against theirs.

1267
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,411
Would have been wonderful to get a couple
of innocent people on the record.

1268
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, well nobody a part
of this story's innocent, Jerry.

1269
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,969
You know, call Norwin Meneses.

1270
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,083
He's in Managua.
He's in a prison.

1271
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,844
He was happy to speak
to me when I came down...

1272
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,843
He said he never spoke to you.

1273
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,044
You kidding me?

1274
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,163
I was in Managua for three days,
you know this-

1275
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,810
I know you were in Managua.

1276
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,082
He said you never got
inside the prison.

1277
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,566
He said he never saw you.

1278
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,404
Well there were five hundred
other people who did.

1279
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,409
Yeah, but can you prove it?

1280
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,084
What, you mean, like did I bring home
a t-shirt from the prison gift shop?

1281
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,243
Do you have any proof you were
actually inside that prison?

1282
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,606
I bribed my way in.

1283
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,090
For Christ's sake.

1284
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:49,323
It's a third world country.
What did you expect me to do?

1285
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,401
What about all my notes?

1286
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,530
Legally, they're just your notes.
All it means is you wrote them.

1287
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,090
You could have made them up later.

1288
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,764
- Fuck you.
- Easy Gary.

1289
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,166
Fuck you both.

1290
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,969
You questioning my ethics?

1291
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:03,170
Thinking I'd re-engineer a goddam thing.

1292
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,324
- How fucking dare you!
- Calm down.

1293
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,688
What about this Swiss banker? Baier?

1294
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,564
Yeah, what about him?

1295
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,085
- I can't find him.
- We're going to have to

1296
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,241
look a little harder then.

1297
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,810
No one's heard from him, Gary.

1298
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,764
This is crazy. This is nuts.

1299
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:21,000
The CIA can't take a piss without
getting their dicks caught in their fly

1300
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,724
but they're absolutely fantastic at this.

1301
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,326
I mean, look at you guys.
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1302
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,208
Like I'm lying.

1303
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,964
- This is-
- That's what you're doing!

1304
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,081
Nobody's saying that.

1305
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,288
- This is not personal. Do not-
- How is this not personal?

1306
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,611
Look, we got into this together,
so we're going to get out of it together.

1307
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,448
How are we going to get out of it?

1308
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,810
We are going to print an open letter...

1309
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,285
...saying that some mistakes were made.

1310
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,925
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

1311
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,048
Come on, there's a bigger
picture here, open your eyes.

1312
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,884
My eyes are wide open.
Know what I see?

1313
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,804
I see a bunch of people who are
worried about their reputations.

1314
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,524
Terrified that the Post
or the Times aren't going to

1315
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,046
pluck you from the foothills of San Jose...

1316
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,849
...and give you a job on the mountaintop.

1317
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,163
You know Jerry, you print that letter,
you can't undo it.

1318
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:12,566
Not ever. You become a paper that tells the
truth only when you fucking feel like it.

1319
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,246
<i>Some of the heavyweights of American
journalism have examined Webb's work...</i>

1320
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,449
<i>...and found it reckless, often wrong.</i>

1321
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,729
<i>Just this week, Webb was
pulled off the CIA story...</i>

1322
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,280
<i>...after his own executive
editor admitted the articles...</i>

1323
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,643
<i>...oversimplified the origins
of the crack epidemic.</i>

1324
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,760
<i>He also wrote,</i>

1325
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:36,442
<i>“I feel that we did not have proof
that top CIA officials knew.”</i>

1326
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,122
<i>Many Americans do seem willing
to believe that their own government...</i>

1327
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,402
<i>...could have been involved
in drug smuggling.</i>

1328
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,040
<i>Despite the criticism of
Mr. Webb's work...</i>

1329
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,761
<i>...he is scheduled to receive the
Bay Area Journalist of the Year Award.</i>

1330
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,601
<i>Some within the organization are
debating whether he is worthy of this-</i>

1331
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,365
Where the fuck's my bike?
Come on. Come on!

1332
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,683
Hey, excuse me,

1333
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,525
have you seen a bike that was here?
motorcycle?

1334
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:06,527
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1335
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,290
God!

1336
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:18,650
Come on.

1337
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,969
What are you looking at?

1338
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,969
- He's here!
- I see his car!

1339
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,411
Daddy!

1340
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:29,765
Dad!

1341
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,888
Hey munchkins!

1342
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,170
How are you?
How you doing?

1343
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,404
Good to see you. How you doing, kiddo?

1344
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,407
What happened to your hand?

1345
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,166
That's just a little scratch.
It's nothing.

1346
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,605
You ever coming home?

1347
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,011
Working on it kiddo, we're working on it.

1348
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,525
Mom! Dad's here!

1349
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,090
Hi, chicken.

1350
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,603
- Hey mom.
- Look at you.

1351
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,410
Come on, Christine, let's go.

1352
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,160
You look beautiful.

1353
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,324
I look beautiful.

1354
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,321
Come in.

1355
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,761
What's this?

1356
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,606
It's a long story.
It's nothing. It's boring.

1357
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,840
Hi.

1358
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,005
How you been?

1359
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,811
Really good, considering.

1360
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,203
I've decided to continue
writing on my own...

1361
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,249
...without the paper.

1362
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,527
You're resigning?

1363
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,090
Yeah.

1364
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,929
- Well that's good.
- Yeah.

1365
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,847
I mean, you know.
Walk away. Fresh start.

1366
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,808
Make room for something new.

1367
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:48,651
Yeah.

1368
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:53,969
Thanks for coming with me.
It means a lot.

1369
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,003
Tonight's going to be a good night.

1370
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,406
Journalist of the Year

1371
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,085
Yeah. You ready? You look ready.

1372
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,288
- You guys behave.
- Love you guys.

1373
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,004
Where's Ian?

1374
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,728
No way.

1375
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,122
No way.

1376
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,886
What?

1377
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,170
What?

1378
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,921
This is great!

1379
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:22,802
Yeah.

1380
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,241
Oh man. Look at her.

1381
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,362
You did it! You did it! You did it!

1382
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,965
Thank you.

1383
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,730
I'm so proud of you.

1384
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,407
- Thank you.
- I'm super proud of you.

1385
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,328
All right! Yes!

1386
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,247
I'll follow you.

1387
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,249
Yeah, don't drive too fast.

1388
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,602
- Well what?
- We'll see.

1389
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,606
Unbelievable!

1390
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,570
Unbelievable.

1391
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,365
Congratulations.

1392
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,604
Congratulations, Gary! Good job!

1393
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,808
Thank you, thank you.

1394
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,683
Good to see you, good to see you.

1395
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:41,648
My first story was about a dog that
should have died, but wouldn't.

1396
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,120
I was twenty-two.

1397
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,965
It was a stupid little feature,
but I was proud of it.

1398
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,765
I put it in a frame
and hung it on my wall.

1399
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:57,726
And believed I joined a secret
guild of reporters that day.

1400
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,041
If there was ever a believer,
it was me.

1401
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:07,768
My last story was about a police
horse in Cupertino, California...

1402
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,008
...who died of constipation.

1403
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,891
Actually, it's not a joke.

1404
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:20,209
But to begin with a dog
and end with a pile of horseshit...

1405
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,764
...there's a kind of poetry in there,
somewhere.

1406
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,841
But this, this is horseshit.

1407
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,361
Me being up here.

1408
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:38,929
Look, I know I pissed off
a lot of people over the years.

1409
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,570
Many of whom are
in this room right now.

1410
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,924
But I think that's what good
investigative reporting does.

1411
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,604
It ruffles feathers.

1412
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,810
But I was never fired.

1413
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,407
And my editors never
threw me under the bus.

1414
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,090
And that's because I never
wrote anything until now...

1415
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:05,725
...that really mattered to a lot of people.

1416
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,689
Mattered in a scary way.

1417
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,649
I'm not going to take it back.

1418
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:18,961
Make nice to save my job.

1419
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,329
Because I thought my job...

1420
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,291
Sorry.

1421
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,244
I thought my job was
to tell the public the truth.

1422
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:42,728
The facts, pretty or not.

1423
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,167
And let the publishing of those facts...

1424
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,129
...make a difference...

1425
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,006
...in how people look at things.

1426
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,242
At themselves,
at what they stand for.

1427
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,330
That's shame on me.

1428
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,240
This is the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

1429
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,603
And for a while...

1430
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,402
...a long while, it was an honor.

1431
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:58,723
Before we say goodnight,
there's one more item of business.

1432
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,611
Hey dad.

1433
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,968
Hey bud.

1434
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,204
You ok?

1435
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,122
I'm not sure.

1436
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,809
Well, I'm really proud of you.

1437
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,244
Thanks bud.

1438
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,565
Listen.

1439
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:49,762
I've done a lot of things
that I'm not proud of.

1440
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,162
But I've never stopped loving you.

1441
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,324
Not once.

1442
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,404
I know.

1443
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,648
- I need some air.
- Yeah.

1444
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,444
Hey dad, don't go too far.

1445
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,084
<i>This town hall meeting allows the
South Central community to interact...</i>

1446
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:48,561
...with the director of Central intelligence.

1447
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,964
Please join me in welcoming CIA Director,
John Deutch.

1448
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,844
How are we supposed to trust...

1449
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,289
...the CIA officials to investigate themselves?

1450
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,243
Is Gary Webb in the house
is the first thing I want to ask?

1451
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:16,685
Is Gary Webb in here?

1452
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,321
Gary Webb is the reporter
for the San Jose Mercury News

1453
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,164
who broke the story wide open.

1454
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:26,326
Allow Gary Webb to have full access to the
Investigator General's full documentation...

1455
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:30,371
...and comparatively go through
it as the investigation goes on.

1456
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,930
There's no question
in my mind there is a complicity

1457
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,889
in the flow of drugs into this country.

1458
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,601
<i>Same pilots, same airstrips,
same airplanes...</i>

1459
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:11,965
<i>...carrying guns and drugs at the same time.
And people knew it.</i>

1460
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,562
South Central Los Angeles and
every other city in America

1461
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:18,086
<i>...are owed an explanation.</i>
