1
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,816
This is stupid.

2
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:42,187
The whole movie
Is just stupid.

3
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,359
Makes perfect sense
Why i'm here.

4
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:49,927
Because this is...

5
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,029
Well, i mean,
It's a good part.

6
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:55,499
I'm directing.

7
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,101
I'm playing a mafia guy.

8
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:02,104
I've
always wanted to play A mafia guy.

9
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:03,873
I thought it would
Be very good.

10
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,074
You might think
It's a great opportunity,

11
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:09,010
But it's not.

12
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:11,813
You know what?

13
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:13,714
Who cares?

14
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:16,517
Ha! I'll just
Bite my tongue,

15
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,987
Think happy thoughts,
And get through this.

16
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,056
Sir, your coffee's
Brewing right...

17
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:34,131
Who am i kidding?

18
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:39,404
Sir, it'll be about Ten more minutes On the coffee.

19
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:40,970
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,809
I'm screwed.

21
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,229
So i have this problem.

22
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,299
I have these constant nightmares
Of spoof movies.

23
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,301
Ugh!
It's so frustrating.

24
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,102
I'm totally haunted
By 'em.

25
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,572
Plus, i have
This other problem.

26
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,441
I get sleepy sometimes,
And i fall asleep.

27
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,343
The worst part is,
I never know...

28
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,014
Hey.

29
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,918
You were asleep
For a while that time.

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,521
I'm sorry. I have this...
I know.

31
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:41,824
You have problems.

32
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,791
We all do.

33
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:46,026
I moved to l.A.
Six months ago,

34
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:49,028
And randy was one of
The first friend i made here.

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,833
He's genuine,
And that's hard to find.

36
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,735
I moved here to be
Closer to my family,

37
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,002
And right now, i'm currently
Working with elderly people

38
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:58,838
At a nursing home.

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,907
I guess i just wanted to do
Something special with my life.

40
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,008
I wanna be
Your boyfriend.

41
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,479
What'd you just say?

42
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,247
I said there's not
Enough sugar on this.

43
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,583
Let me get
Some more here.

44
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:14,551
You're so silly.

45
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:16,386
She's so great.

46
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,087
So i work in
The entertainment industry...

47
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:20,222
Oh!

48
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,225
So i work in
The entertainment industry,

49
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,994
And i work for
A great studio.

50
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,662
Sunshine studios.

51
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:30,531
They put out some of
The highest-quality films.

52
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:36,003
Quality might not
Be the word, but completed.

53
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,170
They have a lot of
Completed films.

54
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:41,708
But completed films
With a lot of heart.

55
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,342
Well, you know,
Maybe not heart,

56
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:48,113
But completed films
That include a running time.

57
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:51,081
Actually, i think
They might be having

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,483
Real financial problems.

59
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,051
Hey, ben.

60
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,787
My name's actually randy.

61
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:58,187
I don't know
Why the guys call me ben.

62
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,689
It's funny though.

63
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,994
Okay, take a look
At this gun.

64
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,996
All right?
It's totally fake.

65
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,598
Is it real?

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,333
It's totally fake.

67
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

68
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,268
After the blank
Goes off right here,

69
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,370
Yeah.
All right?

70
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,039
A blood pack is going
To go off lightly

71
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,773
On your leg
Right there.

72
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,875
I feel like you're not
Listening to me, randy.

73
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:23,477
Randy, randy.

74
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,445
Yeah?
Okay.

75
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,512
Did you get that?
Yeah.

76
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:27,647
You're gonna use
Live ammunition.

77
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,215
Which is cool.
Seriously?

78
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:32,684
I'm cool with that.
Seriously?

79
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,086
There's nothing to Be nervous about.
You'll be fine.

80
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,855
Oh, i'm not nervous.
I'm excited.

81
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:39,189
<i>I get to work with
The c.J. Waters.</i>

82
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,424
Yeah, whatever.
I'm gonna do this to him.

83
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,026
Watch it, c.J.
Your day has come.

84
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,529
And here it is in slo-mo.

85
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,999
Watch it,
c.J. Your day has come.

86
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,244
So an actor doesn't show up,

87
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,713
And some genius here
Decides to put an idiot p.A.

88
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:10,617
In his place because
They wear the same shirt size.

89
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,652
And to think,
A few months ago,

90
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:16,522
I was so excited to work for
A real movie studio.

91
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,156
I hate it here.

92
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,059
I tell all my friends
I work at target.

93
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,528
Quiet on the set!

94
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,729
Quiet!

95
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,564
Cameras are rolling.

96
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:29,900
Sir, can i just say,
It is an honor To work with you.

97
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:31,502
I want you to shut up.

98
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:33,737
I loved you in that movie
When you were a cop,

99
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,605
And you were on
That missing persons case,

100
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:37,206
Only it was a lemur
From the zoo.

101
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,941
It was a ferret.

102
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,476
No, i'm pretty sure It was a lemur.
I would remember.

103
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,344
It was a drama.

104
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:45,446
Why are you even acting?
You're a p.A., aren't you?

105
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,682
In the eighth grade,
I joined troop 1984

106
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:50,050
Of the thespian society,

107

It's written Right over there.
Right? You see it?

118
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,573

My contacts in.

119
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,941

Down, down, down.

00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:44,184
Bulldog three to greyhound six.
We have reached our objective.

181
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,385
<i>This is greyhound six.
What is your position?</i>

182
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,054
<i>Bulldog three. Over.</i>

183
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,554
We are under heavy fire.

184
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,790
<i>We're on our way,
Bulldog three. Out.</i>

185
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,566
Uh, guys,
We're rolling.

186
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:04,601
Cut!

187
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,269
Oh, come on!
Shit!

188
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,171
Can someone get me
An iced tea, please?

189
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:09,706
What is with
The helmet?

190
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,874
You're taking me
Out of my character.

191
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:15,310
Cut! Damn it, ben.

192
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:17,145

Time today.

00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,679
I'm doing paperwork.

194
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,514
So they let me try out
The acting thing.

195
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,084
We found out that
I wasn't "cut out" for it,

196
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:25,518
Which is okay,
Because i'm back to Doing what i love,

197
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,955
Being a production
Assistant again.

198
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:29,723
I'm working on
My lifelong project,

199
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:33,059
Which is a screenplay
About a small boy

200
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:37,462
And my, or his, tricycle,
Who was abused.

201
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,931
It's a drama.

202
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:44,735
<i>The ghost story.
Take 19. Marker.</i>

203

A war, the mafia, ghosts.

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,787
We just have to
Hold on to hope.

225
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,323
No hope.
We're all gonna die out here.

226

Is there anybody
Out there?

248
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:46,539
Who is that?
Anyone?

249
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,574
Who is that?

250
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:50,576
Is that a lifeboat?

251
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:53,079
No. It's okay,
Don't worry.

252
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,314
I'll be fine, okay?

i'm all alone.
I need some company.

255
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:05,422
I've got, like,
12 seats in here.

256
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:08,158
Are you sure there's Not enough
room on That driftwood for me?

257
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,428
Hm-mm. No. I wish there was,
But i'm a little cramped.

258
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,897
You could save
Both of us.

259
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,831
I'm starting to lose
My power of sight.

260
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,101

Still out there?

261
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,502

Actually, this is
Really hot.

277
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:13,180
That beautiful night,
And the moon and everything.

278
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:17,251
But you can't swim,
And there wasn't Room for you on the boat.

279
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:20,253

286
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:31,929
Hi.
Hi.

00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,397
How you doin'
Over there?

288
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,333
I'm not doing
Well at all.

289
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:38,235
I can tell that.
Listen, do you need A nap or something?

290
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,669
No, i don't need
Any nap!

291
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,838
I'm just not strong
Enough to cock it.

292
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Did you just decide To waste everyone's Time today?

293
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,008
Was it
A conscious decision?

294
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,843
How dare you
Talk to me like that?

295
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,845
Because this is how
You cock a gun.

296
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,213
You see that? Just like that.
Is that close enough for you?

297
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,615
I can't do it
When it's not my size.

298
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:57,151
You have to get me a gun
That's right for me.

299
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:59,552
Not your size?
You're the size Of a peanut.

300
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:01,088
This is the size
Of a shotgun.

301
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,923
That's how you cock a gun.
I've told you ten times.

302
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,493
<i>You know what? Titanic has one anchor.
We don't need two.</i>

303
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:10,162
Oh, really?
Yes.

304
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:12,198
You like that?
Let's give you A little bit more.

305
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,666
I'm sorry you can't C-c-cock the gun,
But you're f-f-fired!

306
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:19,337
Thank you.
It'll be A good thing to get Rid of you anyway.

307
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:21,938
I'm glad. Bye, bye, bye.

308
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:29,445
Guys, we gotta talk.

309
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:32,115
Oh. Oh, boy.

310
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:33,316
I, uh...

311
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:35,550
I'm afraid i, uh...

312
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,119
I have horrible news
For all of you.

313
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:40,521
You're all gonna be
Looking for another job.

314
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,458
In a nutshell,
The movie that we made

315
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,260
That we hoped
Would make money,

316
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,861
Came out and...

317
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:51,998
We didn't make zero.

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
I know that sounds
Pretty good,

319
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:55,734
But it's actually
Bad news,

320
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:59,138
Because we ended up
Owing money.

321
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,507
You see, shipping costs,

322
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,742
And the print costs,

323
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,145
Put us in a position
Where we owe

324
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:09,246
More than
It actually made.

325
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,281
I wish we made zero.
Believe me.

326
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:13,917
Excuse me one second.

327
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:18,354
Yes?

328
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:20,222
I'm in an important meeting.

329
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:22,023
Please.

330
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,259
<i>Mr. Storm, you wanna
Look out the window, please?</i>

331
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,628
Mm-hmm.
Okey-dokey.

332
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:36,302
<i>Sir, we're all over here.
Yeah. Uh-huh.</i>

333
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:42,275
<i>Okay. See you over here.</i>

334
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,775
Went to the wrong office
Again, didn't i?

335
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,743
I'll be right there.
Yeah.

336
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:48,213
Keep up the good work. Bye.

337
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:51,248

Everybody take a moment
And give wes

340
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,489
A big round of applause
For shitting on our studio.

341
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:02,525
You know what? Actually,
To be fair, it was steve's idea.

342
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,826
Was it? The shitting
On the studio part?

343
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:08,897
Was it your idea, steve?
Did you direct it, steve? Who directed it, steve?

344
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,165

It was wes, yes.

These are great numbers. Look at this.

349
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,209
Whoo whoo whoo whoo whooo!

350
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,676
Now, what the film
Actually did was...

351
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,047
...A little worse.
Perhaps like this.

352
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,349
You know what i'm saying?
You know what i'm saying, wes?

353
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,218
I'm expecting
Big things--

354
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Wes, i really don't
Wanna hear you talk.

355
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:39,389
I just wanna thank you
So much for begging me

356
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,857
To let you
Direct this film,

357
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,727
Because we just lost
$55 million.

358
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,729
And of course,
We're gonna need You to pay that back.

359
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,999
I don't have
That kind of money.

360
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,200
We'll take it
Out of your paycheck.

361
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,103
Shouldn't take that long.
Write that down, ben. Ben, ben?

362
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:58,106
Take it out of his paycheck.
Shouldn't take too long.

363
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:01,175
People, we gotta
Start over.

364
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,909
We gotta
Get back to basics.

365
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,112
What makes a good film,
A good movie?

366
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,380
The script.
Craft services.

367
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,582
Paris hilton?
Cream.

368
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:12,184
Ice. Vanilla extract.

369
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,587
It's true. Why?

370
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:19,123
Because that's what's
Payin' for the movies.

371
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:23,694
I started making ice cream
In the late 1970's.

372
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,995
And that's where
All my fame and fortune,

373
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,031
That's where it came from.

374
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:31,868
My company was called
30 flavors.

375
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,803
No one could even imagine
Back then.

376
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,373
Thirty flavors of ice cream.

377
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:43,878
That's when robbins
Came up with 31.

378
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:49,149
So i... I had
To call it quits.

379
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:52,486
You know,
Open a movie studio.

380
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:54,554
Rum raisin. Ech!

381
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:57,490
Why couldn't I have thought of that?

382
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,091
I'll tell you why.

383
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:01,593
You don't want
To give a kid liquor

384
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,894
With raisins in it.

385
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:04,896
What... What's that
Teaching us?

386
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,764
What's that teaching us?
What's that teaching our kids?

387
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,966
I even tried it.
I tried drinking rum,

388
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:12,436
Put raisins in it,
It's hideous.

389
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:14,370
Can you imagine freezing
That up, putting it on a cone,

390
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,272
And havin' a kid...

391
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:20,042
What? What? What? What?
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,177
First things first.

393
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,447
I will be leaving
My little brother lester,

394
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,583
Who i don't think
Many of you have met yet,

395
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,718
Will be taking over
For me.

396
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,187
I think dad would've
Liked it that way anyway.

397
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,288
He's a terrific guy.
I know you're gonna like him.

398
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,557
He is kind-hearted,
He's sweet.

399
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,192
He's like a puppy dog.

400
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:41,461
You could tickle him
On the chest.

401
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,963
He's like a pussycat,
But he's also conscientious.

402
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:47,099
I think he'll have
More of the temperament

403
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:49,701
For this kind of work
Than i do.

404
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:53,871
I am having a problem
Keeping my heart beating.

405
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:57,608
Therefore, without Any further ado,
I'll be taking my leave,

406
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,045
And introducing you To my little brother Lester.
Hang ten.

407
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:04,480
Run a tighter ship.

408
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,256
I'd like to thank
My big brother

409
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:17,524
For giving me This opportunity.
Thanks, bro.

410
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:22,028
I do understand
That you're havin' a problem.

411
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,764
So he sent me here
To take care of business.

412
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:29,802
Apparently, there's been
Some problems with, uh...

413
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,436
Your films.

414
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:37,241
I need to understand
What's goin' on around here.

415
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:39,977
He seems nice.
Totally.

416
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,313
I guess one thing
He didn't tell you

417
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,080
Was that i just
Got let out of prison.

418
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:48,251
I was in prison
For killing some people.

419
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:51,520
I slaughtered
A whole family.

420
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:58,526
He probably told you that
You could scratch my tummy.

421
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:03,731
He mentioned it.

422
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,999
But that ain't gonna happen.

423
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,734
Because all these pictures
That you make,

424
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,269
And they just keep tankin',

425
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,970
And that's really
Burnin' my ass.

426
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:15,574
I'm here to find out
What you're gonna do about it.

427
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:21,579
Boom, i got one! Okay? Buddy flick.
Road trip, right? Everybody likes road trips.

428
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,348
All of a sudden,
We're gonna have campfires.

429
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,148
There's water skis,
There's boobs,

430
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,950
And then a hurricane comes,
Spins everybody around.

431
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,319
Everybody's, like,
We're gonna die.

432
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,487
I haven't paid back
My student loans.

433
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,055
Slam, right into
The middle of the desert.

434
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:36,492
Only thing to eat,
Low-fat yogurt.

435
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,160
Let's see it.

436
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:40,128
We didn't get
A chance to make it.

437
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,165
But we made something Much better.
I'm sure You're gonna like it a lot.

438
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah.
It's much better Than his...

439
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:51,138
Let me see how you look
With this hat on.

440
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,340
I think you look
Kinda cute there.

441
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:56,843
Wanna try on my glasses?
No.

442
00:21:56,845 --> 00:22:00,579
I want my hat back.
You can have it. It's all yours.

443
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:03,582
<i>I can't believe You ever dated him.
He's such a pig.</i>

444
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:07,518
<i>Aren't all men?
They're such pigs.</i>

445
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,186
<i>I know.</i>

446
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:13,457
That one has green hair.
No one has green hair.

447
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:16,292
<i>Come on, cheryl.
Say something.</i>

448
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,328
<i>I'm on my period. I'm grouchy.
I don't wanna talk.</i>

449
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,329
Why the fuck did you
Let them do that to you?

450
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,531
I was ganged up on
By a group of girls.

451
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:27,068
Why?

452
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,237
You didn't get
To see the whole thing.

453
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:34,040
And you need
Some new shoes, my dear.

454
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,709
He didn't get to see it all.

455
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,412
I know we were gonna do
That stupid road trip thing,

456
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:40,481
But i mean, he was late,

457
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:43,115
So i took matters
Into my own hands.

458
00:22:43,117 --> 00:22:44,484
It's what anyone would do.

459
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:48,487
I don't know
What his problem is.

460
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,623
Shit, wes,
Light a match! Oh!

461
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,592
Five minutes.
I've heard enough.

462
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:56,927
I was five minutes late,
She's going on... Wah, wah, wah.

463
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:59,897
Let's get honest here.
I'm trying to work on Some concepts.

464
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:02,699
<i>Air bud meets days of thunder.
That's real stuff.</i>

465
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:06,969
Dress me up as some dude-chick
Hybrid in your terrible movie...

466
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:09,505
God. Still hit that though.

467
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:12,441
I'd like to hear
From somebody else.

468
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:25,852
They don't speak english.

469
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,254
I realize that.

470
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,289
We keep trying
To fire 'em,

471
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,024
But they keep
Showin' up anyway.

472
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:36,528
Let's see it.

473
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:44,100
<i>¿Por que, jesus, por que?</i>

474
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:19,965
<i>You're fired.
Gracias, señor.</i>

475
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:23,869
<i>While they were making
Titanic 2,</i>

476
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:27,104
Myself and brian
Wrote a screenplay,

477
00:24:27,106 --> 00:24:28,940
And we put together
A nice little script,

478
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:31,140
And we got tom hanks
Attached.

479
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,577
Tom hanks?

480
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,978
It's the biggest name
Sunshine has ever...

481
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,546
Tom hanks?
Yeah.

482
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:39,615
It's about the life
Of albert einstein.

483
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:41,550
We got exclusive rights
To the story.

484
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:44,386
It's about his life, and it
Delves into his personal past,

485
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:47,321
And his struggles Trying to come
up with The theory of relativity.

486
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:50,091
You mean the mc-squared thing?

487
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:51,992
Right. Exactly.

488
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:54,895
But what about his hair?

489
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:59,131
I can make my hair
Like albert einstein. Look.

490
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:02,702
I'm albert einstein.
Sunshine studio...

491
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:05,137
I know the theory
Of relativity.

492
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,108
It's official, man.
Our boss is insane.

493
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,944
I think we should
Take our script to sony.

494
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,746
Let me give you
Something, sir.

495
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,447
I think you're really
Gonna like this.

496
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,582
What's the most popular
Film genre?

497
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,451
It's gotta be
Martial arts, right?

498
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:26,154
And what's the most popular
Martial arts movie of all time?

499
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:27,956
<i>Kill bill.</i>

500
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,393
<i>Yes, kill bill is definitely...
Right behind that is ninja.</i>

501
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:37,331
<i>And after that,
The third most popular Is the prequel kid ninja.</i>

502
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:40,667
I'm gonna give you guys Something

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,503
The prequel to the prequel.
Let's see it.

504
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:51,043
<i>Where are the diamonds?
In my diaper.</i>

505
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:55,379
<i>Well, give them back.
You'll have to Fight me for them.</i>

506
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:01,251
<i>Counter punch.</i>

507
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,855
You know that you can
See their hands.

508
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,123
Not exactly,
But close.

509
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,925
Thanks, steve.

510
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:10,960
Babies can't stand On their own.

511
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:14,395
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

512
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,598
It was steve's idea.
You gonna blame it on him now?

513
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,001
If you just play The rest of it,
You'll see...

514
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:23,136
<i>uh, baby's crying.</i>

515
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:28,507
How come people
Don't like my ideas?

516
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:31,210
<i>The reviewer said
- the ghost story</i>

517
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:33,345
Didn't make sense.

518
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:36,347
It's a love story
On a haunted luxury liner

519
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,083
That's hijacked
By the mafia

520
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,818
In the middle of
An iraqi war zone.

521
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,953
What part of that
Does not make sense?

522
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:45,690
Here's what i'm
Gonna do now, okay?

523
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,264
Whoo!

524
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:58,701
Improv.
Oh, okay.

525
00:26:58,703 --> 00:27:02,504
I need somebody
To write a script.

526
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:04,238
Anyone.

527
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,773
Anyone in here.

528
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:09,143
I don't care if
You're the fucking janitor.

529
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,177
If you don't bring it to me...

530
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:14,581
I'm going to start
Firing this weapon.

531
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:18,250
I'm out!

532
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,022
He just said anyone.

533
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,923
I'm an anyone.

534
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,826
Ding dong.
Idea at the door.

535
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:29,560
A fat guy
Wanders into a zoo,

536
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,595
Loses his friggin' wallet,
Doesn't know where it is.

537
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:34,665
A gorilla picks it up Who has an innate ability To count.

538
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,100
What's this?
A second climax?

539
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:41,004
All of a sudden,
He realizes animals Have feelings, too.

540
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:43,439
I'm taking speech classes
At a community college.

541
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,906
I'm trying to further
Myself right now.

542
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:47,575
I got 64 credit hours
Under my belt.

543
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:49,410
But i'm an idea hamster.

544
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:51,712
I never stop
Generating ideas.

545
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:54,715
If you're gonna be a bear,
Be a grizzly.

546
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,483
Right now, i'm workin' on
My "hot words."

547
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:59,519
That's including but not
Limited to boom, bam,

548
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:01,821
What up, listen up,
Here comes the mother ship,

549
00:28:01,823 --> 00:28:04,757
Shotgun blast, you know.
They're attention grabbers.

550
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,760
People are responding,
They build confidence, They build energy.

551
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:09,528
Doesn't even matter
What you're sayin'.

552
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,496
Ooh, hop on the pain train
On this one.

553
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:15,066
Check this out.
Idea at the door. Ding dong.

554
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:21,504
One ping, and one ping only.

555
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,640
Periscope up.
We found the friggin' idea.

556
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:25,841
I hate the sound
Of his voice.

557
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:28,010
Reminds me of the sound
Your body makes

558
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,611
When you try to
Hold in a fart.

559
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:32,446
Hello. Hello. Hey, sleepyhead,
You ignoring me?

560
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:34,549
This is an $85 shirt.

561
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:36,350
Let's not forget
What tupac told us.

562
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,887
Tryin' to make a dollar
Out of 15 cents here.

563
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:41,855
Boom, boom. That was loaded.
Put that away.

564
00:28:41,857 --> 00:28:44,024
I'm pretty sure
She's into my ideas.

565
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:46,392
Like, she knows
A good man when she sees one.

566
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:48,728
Right now, i know that i'm
Gettin' those looks from her.

567
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,198
I'm gettin' those, "hey,
what's up on A late-night mistake" look.

568
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,567
And that's the way she operates.
I know how she is.

569
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,503
She said "what up?"
Earlier Over at the potato salad In the break room.

570
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:00,938
I catch her lookin'
All the doggone time.

571
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:11,380
Remember to smile, randy.

572
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,548
Oh, hey, wendy.

573
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,650
You ready for
Poetry club?

574
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:18,987
I have this neighbor,
And her name's wendy,

575
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,955
And she's kinda wonderful.

576
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:26,094
But i can never tell her.
I'm way too insecure.

577
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,863
I'm damaged goods,
If you know what i mean.

578
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:32,665
I think i like you, wendy.
Love you, really.

579
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,000
Matter of fact,
I love you a lot Since i met you,

580
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:38,104
And i wanna have Babies with you.
A lot of babies.

581
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:40,039
Like, quintuplets.

582
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:42,573
She does not have a clue.

583
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:45,176
I'm pretty good
At hiding my feelings.

584
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:47,112
This is
My grandma's ring.

585
00:29:47,114 --> 00:29:51,314
I was wondering if maybe You'd
wear it on Your finger forever.

586
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:54,184
And okay,
You can turn around now.

587
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,918
You don't
Want to.

588
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,554
It was a stupid idea.
You hate it, you hate me.

589
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:02,257
I'm sorry.
Sorry to upset you.

590
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,827
You don't have to give me
The silent treatment, though.

591
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:08,796
I mean, two can
Play at that game.

592
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,998
No, they can't.

593
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,968
Why did she do that?
I'm so stupid.

594
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,470
She's so pretty.
Oh, great, I'm evicted.

595
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:20,606
I'm evicted.

596
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,641
Randy? Did you hear me?
I'm evicted.

597
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,476
Did you say something?

598
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:28,147
Oh, you had
Headphones on.

599
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:29,981
Oh, thank god.

600
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:33,384
I have those ipod ones,
And you can't hear a thing.

601
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:35,987
What are you doing?

602
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:37,954
I was just
Lockin' up.

603
00:30:37,956 --> 00:30:40,090
I'm neurotic,
So i gotta lock it Like, 50 times.

604
00:30:40,092 --> 00:30:44,894
<i>I'm like jack nicholson In as good as it gets.
"Step over the crack."</i>

605
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:46,996
Are you okay? I'm okay.
I'm totally okay.

606
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:50,498
Look, i got a present.
An eviction notice. Ready?

607
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:55,970
I can't wait to hear
All the poems today.

608
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:58,205
I love poems.

609
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,174
I know you do.

610
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:04,777
I don't think randy
Actually knows what a poem is.

611
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,347
I truly believe He thinks he does.
But he's trying, though.

612
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:13,051
This is... This is
A totally original poem.

613
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:20,191
"I am black,
Grew up in the hood,

614
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:22,226
"have no parents,
Shot by cops,

615
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:26,296
"bling bling, blang blang, Bling bling,
bust a cap, Bust a cap, bust a cap.

616
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:28,597
"Sixteen years old
And never found love,

617
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:34,136
"speak in rap,
Wanna fly like a dove Up above the clouds.

618
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:36,538
The clouds."

619
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,274
Some people think they can
Do the spoken word.

620
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:42,476
A bit of times,
It does come out

621
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:44,912
Like verbal diarrhea
Of the mouth.

622
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:48,815
"The clouds calls rain..."
Wait, i'm sorry.

623
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:51,017
That's okay. We understood
Where you were going.

624
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:56,688
I am the head of
Poetry survivors.

625
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,023
There are some dues
That we do have to pay.

626
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:04,395
Each member has to pay
A small fee of $1,500 a week.

627
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:06,796
I know it seems hefty,
But it covers

628
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,200
Quite a few different aspects,
For one, my rent.

629
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:15,171
Um... And if i'm homeless,
I certainly can't hold up A theater group.

630
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:17,840
So here at
This poetry club,

631
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:22,543
We are trying To showcase Original works.

632
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:24,445
It's a policy.

633
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:26,914
Was that yours?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

634
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:31,185
Really? About being
Black and 16?

635
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:32,819
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

636
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:35,221
Are you sure
It was yours?

637
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,957
Well, uh, no.
Not all of it.

638
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,894
But the dut-dut. I'm sorry.
I found it On the internet.

639
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,795
Okay. Okay.

640
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,730
But i can read my script
If you like.

641
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:48,332
No, no.
That's okay.

642
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,567
Maybe next week.

643
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,603
Randy always wants
To read his script.

644
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:54,537
He gets so into it.
I hate it.

645
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:00,809
He assigns everybody parts,
And it's so long and boring.

646
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:06,548
Looks like you and randy
Have been going out a lot.

647
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,783
Yeah, i guess so.
Yeah. That's great.

648
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:12,353
I mean, he's got a lot
Of great qualities.

649
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,621
He... He's a guy.

650
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:16,390
He's a great guy.

651
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:18,758
What exactly
Do you see in him?

652
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,029
Look, i know He's not perfect,
But neither am i.

653
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:25,697
Do you know what he does
Every morning?

654
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,766
I don't know.
Copy down Shakespeare and call it His own?

655
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:31,602
He goes to His grandma's At the nursing home.

656
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:36,140
And she has alzheimer's.
She wouldn't even know If he came or not.

657
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:38,409
But he goes every day.

658
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:41,145
That's why he wants To be a screenwriter,
You know.

659
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:43,512
So he can make Lots of money And be able

660
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:46,015
To take care of her
The proper way.

661
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,918
There's not a lot Of guys left like that In the world.

662
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,155
Oh, my god.
I'm such a bitch.

663
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,523
I mean, i had no idea.

664
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,658
I... I totally thought
He was kind of an idiot,

665
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,860
But i was so wrong.

666
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:03,930
Hey, randy.
Are you getting sleepy?

667
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:13,038
Hey, ben.

668
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:20,311
Ben!
The guys have been Having a great time Here at work.

669
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:24,714
They've been calling me ben,
Which i just think is so funny.

670
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:26,850
Ben, damn it, ben!
Benjamin! Ben!

671
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:30,819
Ben, where is My coffee, ben? Ben.

672
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,989
They have
This good one, right?

673
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:35,657
They made out
My paycheck to ben,

674
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,993
Which is just
So hilarious.

675
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:40,428
I tried to explain that
To the bank.

676
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,230
They didn't get it,

677
00:34:42,232 --> 00:34:46,166
Which is a serious problem,
Because i can't pay my rent now.

678
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,535
"Ben."

679
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:50,471
Did you just eat that?

680
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:52,705
Yeah.

681
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,276
My name's ernie.

682
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,378
I'm 38 years young,

683
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,715
And i'm a production assistant
Here with randy,

684
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:05,582
Which is great.

685
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:09,753
It's always been my dream To
become a production Assistant.

686
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:12,389
Some people
Like to dream high.

687
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:17,093
But if you set Your goals too high,
You might not ever reach 'em.

688
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:21,963
The shitter's
Clogged again.

689
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:25,599
Um, apparently, target
Was looking for someone

690
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:28,069
With more "people skills."

691
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:31,139
I would've killed
For that job.

692
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:36,809
Don't worry about it, man.
I'll take care of it For you, okay?

693
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:39,545
You just,
You know, relax.

694
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,283
I have a very weak stomach.

695
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:48,920
I can't really do
The toilets or sometimes,

696
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:52,524
Take out the trash,
'cause i'll gag sometimes.

697
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,159
Usually always.

698
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:59,995
That and fish filets
From mcdonald's.

699
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:02,231
It's something
With the sauce.

700
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:06,269
It's like the white
And the green.

701
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:09,271
Just thinkin' about it
Makes me wanna...

702
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:11,506
I can't even think
About fish.

703
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:14,308
It just...
Sorry.

704
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,746
Sorry. I have
These nightmares.

705
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:21,481
I know we were
Doin' this interview.

706
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:24,517
I dream of these spoof movies
All the time,

707
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,953
And i hate it.

708
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:28,954
I don't know
Where it comes from.

709
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:31,190
Maybe my childhood.
Maybe a...

710
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,097
<i>you have to love
Naked gun.</i>

711
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:41,298
Why aren't you laughin'?
Laugh!

712
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,534
Dad, it was funny The first few
hundred Times we watched it.

713
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,536
What if we watch
Something else?

714
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:51,440
<i>That's a great idea. What about
Naked gun 33 1/3, huh?</i>

715
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,942
How about
I get the popcorn?

716
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,810
You stay there.
I'll get it.

717
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:58,079
Okay, dad.
Oh, man.

718
00:37:05,553 --> 00:37:07,721
Thanks, man.

719
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:11,657
It's just, last time,
I started throwin' up When i tried to fix it.

720
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,226
No biggie, man.
I understand.

721
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,694
I owe you big time.

722
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:21,133
Is it bad in there?
You have no idea.

723
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:24,768
Overall, my lifelong
Dream and goal

724
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,772
Is to find and marry And settle
down with A beautiful woman.

725
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:33,143
He's not comin'.

726
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:35,411
If he isn't, I'm in charge.
Right, wes.

727
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:37,846
You see the way He was acting?
He was looking for

728
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,348
Any reason to punch
Someone on their ass.

729
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,783
You know what?
Steve's in charge. No, i'm good.

730
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:44,985
So do you guys think That was
a real gun He was packin'?

731
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:48,256
You bet it was.
Hi there.

732
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,990
Michael foster,
Lester's lawyer.

733
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:54,261
Lester's been arrested
For killing his parole officer.

734
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:57,163
He shot and killed
About 20 people.

735
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:59,731
That's awful.
You're tellin' me.

736
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:02,134
So what's gonna
Happen to him now?

737
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:04,369
He'll get about
Five or six days in jail.

738
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:06,371
He'll be out on parole Soon enough.
I am His lawyer after all.

739
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:08,640
Really?
No.

740
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,475
I'd say the electric chair's About
the best he can Hope for now.

741
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:12,309
<i>Que horrible.</i>

742
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:15,111
You're probably wondering Who
is going to Take over the studio

743
00:38:15,113 --> 00:38:17,514
In lester's absence.
It's his wishes

744

No more fives and sixes In the office.

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,425
Hey, nancy.
Thank you, michael.

747
00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:32,959

A girl's name?

748
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:35,062
Wes! So lame.

I have to get going,
And i'm gonna leave you In the capable hands of nancy.

751

Let me just be the first To say
we're really Glad to have you here.

753
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,640
You have some
Pretty big shoes to fill.

754
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:53,444
Shut up, fat face. And you.
You ever laugh at my name again,

755
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,747
I'll put my arm Down your throat,
Grab hold of your balls,

756
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:59,182
Pull 'em out And kick you In the nuts.

757
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:01,251
All right, son?

758
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:05,722
You might have noticed I've got a
bit of a complex About my name.

759
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,057
Now...

760
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,928
Now that we all know Who's got the
biggest Set of bollocks around here,

761
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,630
Let's get
Down to business.

762
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:18,899
I'm here to make sure
You hit your deadlines.

763
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,034
You have a couple of days.

764
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:23,637
So far, you're filling
Those shoes nicely.

765
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:26,072
Shut it.
So i'm here

766
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:29,342
To give you some inspiration.
In fact,

767
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:31,344
I'm gonna tell you
A story.

768
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:34,346
Once upon a time,
In the east end of london,

769
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:37,415
There was a little lad.
He used to go to the movies

770
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,218
Every sunday with his auntie.
His name was nancy.

771
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,055
<i>Nancy's favorite movie
Was a movie called snatch,</i>

772
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:48,691
Because it had this big,
Fierce guy in there.

773
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:51,160
His name was
Bullet-tooth tony.

774
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:54,229
Now bullet-tooth tony...

775
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:59,067
Had a gun, and it was
A desert eagle .50.

776
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:04,071
A bit similar to this one.

777
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:09,342
Now... If you lot
Don't write this script,

778
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:12,445
I'm gonna end up shootin'
At least six of ya.

779
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,514
So let's get it done,
Shall we?

780
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:21,320
<i>Now!
No me mate, por favor.</i>

781
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:31,027
I'm just reading
The u.S. Mandated set of rules

782
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,697
For all businesses.

783
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:38,133
I don't know exactly
If it specifically says

784
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,703
It's illegal to bring
A gun to work

785
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,538
And threaten your employees,

786
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,809
But i'm pretty positive
It says it here somewhere.

787
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,679
I know you can't
Bring two guns,

788
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:54,415
Or have two people
Bring a gun at the same time.

789
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:12,162
'Ello there.

790
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:14,398
I'm bullet-tooth... Ah!

791
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:22,939
Yep. Right here. Right here.
No, that's not it.

792
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,606
I think
It's a great idea.

793
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,241
Really? You're not
Just saying that?

794
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,543
No. I think
He'll love your script.

795
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:29,945
I think people will
Really connect with it.

796
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:32,213
I've never read it.

797
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:34,549
Here's what happened.

798
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,351
The script is really long,

799
00:41:36,353 --> 00:41:39,319
So i took a week
Off of work to read it.

800
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:41,621
I was at my apartment
Out on the balcony,

801
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:45,558
It was really windy,
And the pages started Blowin' everywhere.

802
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,394
All over the place.
And when i say everywhere,

803
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:51,129
I mean everywhere.
They were all over My neighborhood.

804
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:54,298
It's over 600 pages.

805
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,469
And here's the thing.
He didn't number them.

806
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:01,071
You have to number
Your pages always.

807
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:04,441
So i didn't
Get to read it.

808
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:07,076
Let me ask you A question
about My script that you read.

809
00:42:07,078 --> 00:42:10,079
The father scene Where my father
was Abusive to the character,

810
00:42:10,081 --> 00:42:12,313
Do you think the color
I picked for the tricycle

811
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:14,349
Matches the emotional
Tone of the scene?

812
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,751
Um, i...
What color was it?

813
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:18,253
What was it?

814
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:21,088
I can't quite remember.
I'm forgetting.

815
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,956
Green?
No, green was my big wheel.

816
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,992
Red?
No, it wouldn't be red.

817
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:27,360
So aren't you A little worried
about The length of your script?

818
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:29,362
No. Why, do you think
It's too short?

819
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:31,498
He said it should be,
Like, 90 pages.

820
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,132
So you should probably Hurry up
if you want To finish it, right?

821
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,603
Yeah, i better get goin'.
I've only got four hours left.

822
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:39,371
It's not due till
Tomorrow morning.

823
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:41,272
But my bedtime's 10:00.
Where are you going?

824
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:43,508
Randy, i drove you today.

825
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,743
No running in the halls.

826
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:48,244

827
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,246

Okay? Love you though.

829
00:42:52,785 --> 00:42:56,218
I'm sorry.
I actually Didn't mean that Last part, okay?

00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,253

831
00:42:58,255 --> 00:43:00,288
Huh? No. Gotta go!

Oh, no.

00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:45,360
Oh, god.

834
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:49,096

Hi, randy.

Well, back to work.

838
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:07,346
Oh, no.

839
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:17,688
What happened?

840
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,161
Fifteen. Eight.

841
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,164
Ninety-seven.
Eight. Okay.

842
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,502
And... 90.
Done.

843
00:44:37,438 --> 00:44:40,307
So i'm stealing that little
Prick's tricycle script.

844
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:43,544
I can't lose my job.
How am i gonna do it?

845
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:45,344
Easy. Rule

846
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:50,349
What?

847
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:06,630
Shit!

848
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,740
Something about smoke alarms.
I don't know. I always forget.

849
00:45:24,446 --> 00:45:27,648
Rule

850
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,383
Wait, i don't think that's...

851
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:38,424
Today is the day
I get to pitch my script.

852
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:42,160
This could be the beginning
Of my new life.

853
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:45,564
Apparently, i peed
My pants last night,

854
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:48,165
And i think there might have
Been a fire in my apartment.

855
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,337
Well, guys...

856
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:59,308
You must admit,
All your ideas are crap.

857
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,712
So, matt and brian
Apparently have a script

858
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:08,482
With a big name attached,
So, matt, brian.

859
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,787
I can't work there anymore.
That is not a studio, okay?

860
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:16,856
It's a joke. I've never
Heard of one of their movies.

861
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,025
Tom hanks.
We had tom hanks.

862
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,525
Tom hanks on A letter Of intent.

863
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,261
Go away. Get out.
Come on, man, let's go.

864
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,399
Fantastic, randy.
Thanks for joining us.

865
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:32,203
I don't suppose There's any chance
of you Comin' out with a screenplay

866
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:33,671
Or anything?

867
00:46:33,673 --> 00:46:36,239
I think you're all
Gonna really like it.

868
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:38,341
Love it, really.

869
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:41,543
I've been working on it
My whole life.

870
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:44,146
It couldn't be crappier
Than wes' idea about a tricycle.

871
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:48,349
Yeah, it was stupid.
What?

872
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:50,485
Am i not
Speakin' english?

873
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:53,955
Wes here wanted To do a movie About...

874
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:57,357
Some abused kid On a tricycle.
Same old tired crap.

875
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,628
Abuse happens every day.
Just suck it up. Whatever.

876
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:09,635
I can't believe it.
I was going to pitch A very similar idea

877
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:12,004
About a tricycle
And an abused kid.

878
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:17,241
So what's your idea? My idea.
You probably Want my idea.

879
00:47:17,243 --> 00:47:19,810
Oh, jesus christ.

880
00:47:19,812 --> 00:47:22,278
Jesus christ.

881
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,515
I would like to thank you all
For joining me

882
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:27,851
For my last supper.

883
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:30,986
Now, first things first.

884
00:47:30,988 --> 00:47:36,323
Must we all be on
The same side of the table?

885
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:38,860
I don't understand.
There's no chairs.

886
00:47:40,797 --> 00:47:43,697
Perhaps a few of you Could move
to the other Side of the table.

887
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:47,167
That way, we could
See each other.

888
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:49,536
Forget it.

889
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:52,638
I'm afraid i have
Some troubling news.

890
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,477
One of you
At this very table

891
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:01,612
Is going to betray me.

892
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:06,616
Now, i won't say who.

893
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:10,720
I don't think
That's the right thing to do.

894
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:15,858
Judas!

895
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:21,697
But i will... I will say that
It's none of you six men.

896
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,801
Nor is it you.

897
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:30,537
Or you.

898
00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:36,943
No. Or you.

899
00:48:40,113 --> 00:48:43,215
It is not you.

900
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:45,449
Or judas.

901
00:48:46,952 --> 00:48:49,353

00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:52,055

912
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,213
There's no plot.
Script?

913

No script.
Good.

914
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:29,054

I'm frustrated.
Spoof movies!

925
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:07,753
All the time, every minute,
I fall asleep, you know,

926
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,221
And i dream
Of these spoof movies,

927
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:10,790
And i hate it.
I wanna be...

928
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:14,759
Sorry. When i think of
A spoof movie,

929
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,096
I just... ...
I kinda get upset.

930
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:22,132
<i>But i wanna dream of art movies,
You know, like the piano.</i>

931
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:24,634
<i>Or pi.
Those are art.</i>

932
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:28,005
Not spoofs.
Not at all.

933
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:30,472
Randy.

934
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:53,126

Congratulations.
Let's do a spoof movie.

937
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,267
I got a lot of Brainstorming to do On the spoof movies.

938
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,036
I love spoof movies.

939
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,341
Do i think they'll do it?

940
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,411
It's possible.
Do i think i could

941
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:17,947
Kill one of them
And get away with it?

942
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,715
It's possible.

943
00:51:22,585 --> 00:51:26,020
It's possible.

944
00:51:26,022 --> 00:51:29,590
So stupid! So stupid!

945
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:37,429

946
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:01,784
Oh, sorry, kitty.

947
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,387
Wait a second.
I don't have a cat.

948
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:08,957
This isn't my apartment.
- Hello?

949
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:17,564
So...

950
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,933
Why are you so sad?

951
00:52:19,935 --> 00:52:22,302
Wendy, i did
Something horrible.

952
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:25,771
I did something i said
I would never do my whole life

953
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:30,376
I sold my soul.
I'm making a spoof movie.

954
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:34,545
You can never talk to me
Again if you don't want to.

955
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:36,580
First of all,
I like spoof movies.

956
00:52:36,582 --> 00:52:39,783
No, you don't.
You're always talking In our poetry club

957
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:42,452
How you hate 'em
And they're stupid...

958
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:44,654
No, i don't.
Everybody else does that.

959
00:52:44,656 --> 00:52:47,856
And besides, who cares
What everybody else thinks?

960
00:52:47,858 --> 00:52:52,928
This is your big chance To make a movie.
You should be happy.

961
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,231
You, right now, are like
A proverb to my soul.

962
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:58,066
I'm gonna do it.

963
00:52:58,068 --> 00:53:01,735
I'm gonna make that
Piece of crap spoof movie,

964
00:53:01,737 --> 00:53:05,705
And it's gonna be The best piece of
crap That anybody has ever made.

965
00:53:05,707 --> 00:53:08,408
Can you make me
One pinky promise?

966
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,943
You've got
Both of 'em.

967
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:12,845
Can you just not make
A drama about a tricycle?

968
00:53:14,414 --> 00:53:16,148
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.

969
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:19,517
I'm kidding, randy.

970
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:22,353
I read your script,
Remember, about your abuse.

971
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:25,722
Yeah. That actually
Wasn't about me, remember?

972
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:29,426
That was about my cousin.
The character, my cousin.

973
00:53:29,428 --> 00:53:30,760
Then why did you
Call him randy

974
00:53:30,762 --> 00:53:32,963
And have the same
Parents' names as yours?

975
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:35,965
And how he also
Had a brother named joshua?

976
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:39,568
You're right.
Making A spoof movie's A great opportunity.

977
00:53:44,706 --> 00:53:47,575
So it's the big day. Oh!

978
00:53:47,577 --> 00:53:49,443
It's the start of
Pre-production,

979
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:51,845
And i have got
A lot of pressure on me.

980
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:54,314
You know,
Because i'm in charge.

981
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:56,115
But it's okay,

982
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:58,384
Because everyone says
I work best under pressure.

983
00:54:07,093 --> 00:54:10,494
Speak english!
Speak english!

984
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:25,907
Where's randy?

985
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:28,743

1019
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,725
I thought the new boss Was supposed
to fire Alejandro and guzman.

1020
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,493
I thought he did.

1021
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:07,827
I thought you told me You were gonna Say something.

1022
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:09,963
I told 'em
They were fired.

1023
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:12,598
But when i was in the meeting,
I came in, i didn't Expect to see them.

1024
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,233
It was so awkward.

1025
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:16,469
I told 'em.
I don't think They understand.

1026
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:19,338
It's probably 'cause
They don't speak english.

1027
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,806
Maybe you should try
To say something again.

1028
00:56:21,808 --> 00:56:24,576
You're probably right.
I feel so bad.

1029
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:27,511
I know. They're
Such great guys.

1030
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:30,581
Just don't tell 'em
I said anything, okay?

1031
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:32,182
Okay.

1032
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:35,384
All right, guys.

1033
00:56:35,386 --> 00:56:37,753
Bad news again.

1034
00:56:37,755 --> 00:56:40,422
You're fired.

1035
00:56:40,424 --> 00:56:42,290

<i>Adios.</i>

1038
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,064
I heard a voice in the...

1039
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:53,667
I'm sorry.
It's the...

1040
00:56:53,669 --> 00:56:56,469
You know, square...

1041
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,304
Cold thing.

1042
00:56:58,306 --> 00:57:01,873
Bottom line, boom.
I was born to do casting.

1043
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,942
Okay? My brain farts
Are box office gold.

1044

See, here's what it says.
"Refrig..."

1045
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:07,711

You can say the word.

Refrigerator. That's really good.
Now just use it!

1047
00:57:11,251 --> 00:57:14,917
Acting is reacting. You're doing
None of these things.

To hang those up.

1072
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:50,667

<i>No, ernie.
It's The little kid From jerry maguire.</i>

1079
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:22,394
Wait a minute.
This used to be The bathroom.

00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,663
We're just doing
A little editing here.

1083
00:59:31,537 --> 00:59:34,271
Who's your brother?
Because all visitors Are supposed to check in

1084
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:38,375
With lewis in the lobby,
And he's a stickler.

1085
00:59:38,377 --> 00:59:40,409
His name is lester,
Lester storm.

1086
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,678
Don't recall.
He's your boss.

1087
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,413
I thought I was the boss.
I'm taking over for you.

1088
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:47,014
Randy, randy, randy,
He owns the studio.

1089
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,884
You are the director,
Which means you are Not in charge.

1090
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,019
Hold it, hold it.

1091
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,153
You're the director?

Time ago, sir.

01:00:03,364 --> 01:00:07,064
That was three days ago.
I know. It's been, Like, 72 hours.

1097
01:00:07,066 --> 01:00:09,301
He's makin'
A spoof movie.

1098
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:11,603
No, ernie!
It's really, really funny.

01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:13,104
Uh-huh.

1100
01:00:13,106 --> 01:00:15,439
Spoof movies.
I hate them. Hate them.

1101
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:18,542
I don't care
What you call 'em.

1102
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:22,845
It's just cheap, cheap parody.
It can even be expensive.

1103
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:25,281
<i>They tried to do
Gone with the breeze.</i>

1104
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:27,283
They couldn't even
Get the fires going.

1105
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:29,150
It was like a breeze.
Just a breeze.

1106
01:00:29,152 --> 01:00:31,119
Huh? I don't get it.
I don't get it.

1107
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:33,121
I don't get spoof movies.

That scared the crap
Outta me.

1120

A bad guy in a movie, um...

I don't know
How to put into words...

1122
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:17,525

You know, i'm starting to
Get used to this makeup thing.

1152
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:40,296
I mean, it's a gift.
I never knew i had it,

1153
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,299
But i'm pretty good at it.

1154
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:47,803
Kind of regret not wearing it
More as a child.

1155
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:49,504
Maybe i should try it.

1156
01:02:52,108 --> 01:02:55,042
What up, what up?
Tryin' to make an honest dollar.

1157

Staple your lips together.

Now keep it shut.

1184
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:04,234
Right. Saving caps.
What are we gonna do?

1185
01:04:04,236 --> 01:04:08,404
You know what, sir?
I actually don't have Any ideas on this matter,

1186
01:04:08,406 --> 01:04:11,040
But randy has quite a few.
Go ahead, randy.

1187
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:12,642
Randy?

1188
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:15,477
You understand the queen's
English, randy? Spit it out.

1189
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:17,345
Just tell him Your ideas.

1190
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:20,649
Come on, randy.
Just let it out. Go ahead.

1191
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:24,585
Get off my shoes, randy.

1192
01:04:24,587 --> 01:04:28,755
That's what we don't Need in a leader, right?
Am i right?

1193
01:04:28,757 --> 01:04:31,224
It was kind of like
Being pinched really hard

1194
01:04:31,226 --> 01:04:33,226
In the nut sack.

1195
01:04:33,228 --> 01:04:35,495
My dad used to pinch me
Really hard

1196
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,796
When i wouldn't salute him
Or call him sir,

1197
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:40,666
Or get the towels In the
bathroom Aligned just perfectly.

1198
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,167
They had to be perfect,
The his and her towels.

1199
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:46,337
I mean, aligned just right,
Or, oof!

1200
01:04:46,339 --> 01:04:49,606
He also used to shoot me
With a bb gun, and that hurt.

1201
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:51,608
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1202
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:53,476
If you mess with me,

1203
01:04:53,478 --> 01:04:56,278
I will cut your throat
Like a stick of butter.

1204
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,714
Like a stick
Of butter. Like.

1205
01:04:58,716 --> 01:05:00,550
No. I mean...

1206
01:05:00,552 --> 01:05:02,552
If you mess with me,
I will cut your throat...

1207
01:05:02,554 --> 01:05:04,619
You're not scary.
"If you mess with me,

1208
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:07,956
I'll cut your throat Like a stick of butter,"
Is the line.

1209
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:12,359
If you mess with me,
I will cut your throat Like a stick of butter.

1210
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:14,428
Okay?
It was bad.

1211
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,697
I'll tell you,
You're too cute...

1212
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:19,699
If you mess with me,
I will cut your throat Like a stick of butter.

1213
01:05:19,701 --> 01:05:22,035
That's the best you got?
Ow! What?

1214
01:05:22,037 --> 01:05:24,703
If you mess with me,

1215
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:28,206
I will cut your throat
Like a stick of butter.

1216
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:31,141
I knew it!
Get out of my way!

1217
01:05:32,243 --> 01:05:34,378
What's wrong with that guy?

1218
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:38,682
I don't know.
What's this guy's problem?

1219
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,585
I'm gonna fuckin'
Knock him across the wall

1220
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:43,720
In a second here.
I don't...

1221
01:05:43,722 --> 01:05:47,056
What's he afraid of, ya know?
I celebrate christmas,

1222
01:05:47,058 --> 01:05:52,060
I go to the ymca
On occasion.

1223
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:54,261
I walk to the park.

1224
01:05:54,263 --> 01:05:57,198
Sometimes, i sail on boats.

1225
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,801
Randy? Hey, i'm sorry, dude.

1226
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:04,104
Come on. We got off
On the wrong foot.

1227
01:06:04,106 --> 01:06:08,841
I feel bad. I was just Readin' my lines, right?
You wrote the lines.

1228
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:11,010
If you come out here,
We give it a chance,

1229
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:13,344
We'll start over.
How's that sound?

1230
01:06:14,914 --> 01:06:16,648
All right.

1231
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,150
You're startin' to make me
Look like an asshole.

1232
01:06:20,152 --> 01:06:23,487
If you don't come up,
I'm gonna go out to my truck,

1233
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:26,522
Get my filet knife,
And gut you like a fish.

1234
01:06:29,593 --> 01:06:33,194
Startin' to make me
Look like an asshole.

1235
01:06:33,196 --> 01:06:35,363
'Cause acting,
That's like a tennis match.

1236
01:06:35,365 --> 01:06:38,066
It's like, you fire
Me a line and then you fire one.

1237
01:06:38,068 --> 01:06:40,034
And then it's
Back and forth.

1238
01:06:40,036 --> 01:06:42,103
Who wins, i don't know.
That's how the scene plays out,

1239
01:06:42,105 --> 01:06:44,338
<i>but, um... When
A few good men came out,</i>

1240
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:47,841
Were you gettin',
Like, mad ass?

1241
01:06:47,843 --> 01:06:49,142
I'm married.

1242
01:06:49,144 --> 01:06:50,644
That's cool.

1243
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:53,411
You know what?
I need to talk To the director,

1244
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,714
If he's awake.

1245
01:06:55,716 --> 01:06:57,516
Randy!

1246
01:07:01,987 --> 01:07:05,089
Okay, patrick,

01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:09,110
<i>Daddy? Hey, baby.

I gotta quit
Smokin' cigarettes.

1276
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:38,602
Dad, it's me. Listen.
What you're doin' is A very brave thing.

1277
01:08:38,604 --> 01:08:41,004
You should be proud.
I am.

1278
01:08:41,006 --> 01:08:44,340
I'm just the wrong guy In the
wrong place At the wrong time.

1279
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:47,877
Wait a minute.
That's not my dad.

1280
01:08:47,879 --> 01:08:52,547
My dad's supposed to be Flying a
fighter jet into An alien spaceship.

1281
01:08:55,051 --> 01:08:57,085
Who's drivin' this ship,
Stevie wonder?

1282
01:08:57,087 --> 01:08:59,186
Sorry.

There's some tang In the cooler.
I'll get some tang.

1284
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,023
They still make tang?
They do.

1285
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:05,591
I love tang.
You know they make Grape tang now.

1286
01:09:05,593 --> 01:09:08,628

01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:14,566
<i>Push it!</i>

1290
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:16,769
Yippie-kai-yay, mother...

01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:20,004
Yippie-kai-yay, mother...

1292
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:28,645
Yippie-kai-yay, moth--

01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:32,314
He pushed the button!
He pushed the button!

I love him.
He pushed the button.

1295
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:38,420
I love my dad.
Guys, actually,

1296
01:09:38,422 --> 01:09:40,121
He didn't push
The button in time.

1297
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:41,489
What?

1298
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,391
He only missed it
By a few minutes.

1299
01:09:43,393 --> 01:09:45,393
Yeah, exactly.

1300
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:48,395
Actually, he missed it
By about an hour and a half.

1301
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:52,299
Oh, look. It just
Touched the earth.

1302
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:55,001
Are we gonna...

1303
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:04,342
Randy!
Get up.

1304
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:07,544
Wastin' the talent's
Time here.

1305
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,547
I'll talk to you, cuba.

1306
01:10:10,549 --> 01:10:13,482
Sorry about that.
I dozed off there.

1307
01:10:13,484 --> 01:10:17,420
Hey, i was hopin' I'd get a
chance To talk to you, wolfgang.

1308
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,722
Can i call you wolf?
Yeah.

1309
01:10:19,724 --> 01:10:22,090
Great. Listen, dawg,
You had a great performance,

1310
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,259
Especially those Last few takes.
It was so good.

1311
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,594
It was great.
There's nothin' I can even say.

1312
01:10:26,596 --> 01:10:28,395
It was amazing.
Thank you.

1313
01:10:28,397 --> 01:10:33,500
I do have some notes,
Mainly about your dialogue. Not working.

1314
01:10:33,502 --> 01:10:35,568
You want me to do
Something different?

1315
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,704
I'm just tryin' to do
The lines like in the movie.

1316
01:10:37,706 --> 01:10:40,873
Yeah, that's what i was Hoping for, too,
along With the rest of the crew.

1317
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:43,876
Really, what i was hoping For was
maybe that you Did some research,

1318
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:48,246
And maybe rented the movie
Once or twice or once.

1319
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:53,318
Really researched it,
Because you obviously Don't know what a code red is.

1320
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,321
I don't need To rent the movie.
I was in the movie.

1321
01:10:57,323 --> 01:10:59,389
I know what
A code red is.

1322
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,458
Were you an extra?
An extra?

1323
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,728
Mm-hmm.
I was one of the leads.

1324
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:08,064
That's why they
Cast me in this role.

1325
01:11:08,066 --> 01:11:10,298
It was a role
I played in the movie.

1326
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,767
I get it.

1327
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,302
This is an issue
Of industry terminology.

1328
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:19,673
You see,
a lead is One of the focus characters In the film.

1329
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,375
You were probably
A lead background extra,

1330
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:24,377
Which is more like
A set piece or a prop.

1331
01:11:24,379 --> 01:11:27,613
I had a pretty good Role in that movie.

1332
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:30,749
I was not a prop.

1333
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,717
No reason to raise
Your voice, okay?

1334
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,486
Who's raising their voice?

1335
01:11:34,488 --> 01:11:37,721
No reason to scream.
I think there's just A miscommunication here.

1336
01:11:37,723 --> 01:11:40,424
What we're spoofing
Is a military courtroom drama

1337
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:44,327
That had jack nicholson,
Tom cruise and Denzel washington.

1338
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:48,865
It wasn't Denzel washington.
It was me.

1339
01:11:48,867 --> 01:11:51,233
Okay?

1340
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:55,570
I'm the actor Who played the guy Who did the code red.

1341
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,571
Agree to disagree.

1342
01:11:57,573 --> 01:12:00,474
Why are we shooting this
In a spaceship?

1343
01:12:00,476 --> 01:12:02,243
Because that's
Where it happened.

1344
01:12:02,245 --> 01:12:04,778
You know what?
Maybe you oughta Rent the movie.

1345

To fight with you, okay?

1348

01:12:17,391 --> 01:12:18,890
"You ordered the code red."

1351
01:12:18,892 --> 01:12:22,060

And it's the moment...

1378
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:29,584
You said you loved me.

1379
01:13:29,586 --> 01:13:32,253

One of those.

1380
01:13:32,255 --> 01:13:34,221
What did you think About what i said Or didn't say?

1381

Just a minor issue, randy.
We're missing all of Our footage.

1400
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:32,571
We only have one tape.
Should we have More than one?

1401
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:35,573
Hey, news flash, randy.

An observation, randy?

And does weird Little thing with them,
Then he brings them back

Read it again.

1507
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:50,627
That's a good idea.
Would you like that, Randy? Yeah?

1508
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:54,564
"Once upon a time, there were
Two dead, naked bodies."

1509
01:20:56,032 --> 01:20:57,867
Come on,
Snap out of it.

1510
01:20:57,869 --> 01:20:59,669
I can't breathe.
Oh, you can breathe.

1512
01:21:01,204 --> 01:21:03,472
You ready
To quit faking?

1513
01:21:03,474 --> 01:21:06,274
Oh. Oh, great.

Or you'll feel The back of my hand.

1520
01:21:31,063 --> 01:21:33,097

1524
01:21:46,009 --> 01:21:48,544
No, you can't.
Yes, i can.

1525
01:21:48,546 --> 01:21:51,279
It's our wits
That make us men,

1526
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,282
And you do not Have any wits.
You've none at all.

1527
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,550

Downright stupid.

1528
01:21:56,552 --> 01:21:59,820

1530
01:22:02,324 --> 01:22:04,189
Before you cut
Your bollocks off.

1531
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:07,192
In fact, if you
Got into a fight,

1532
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:11,963
You'd probably
Run away and piss yourself.

1533
01:22:11,965 --> 01:22:16,468
Jesus christ.
You cannot Even stay awake for Five minutes.

1534
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:28,210
I'm alive!

1535
01:22:28,212 --> 01:22:30,612
It was a joke.
You're an asshole.

Okay, now you're
Being mean.

Your script.

1552

I can't breathe
Right now.

1593
01:25:34,973 --> 01:25:37,271
I might have thrown The ring into The l.A. River.

1594
01:25:37,273 --> 01:25:39,407
No, you didn't.
No, i did.

1595
01:25:39,409 --> 01:25:41,810
I threw it hard. I threw it really far.
I'm a baseball player.

1596
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:44,144
No, you didn't. No, i did.
I know what i did.

1597
01:25:44,146 --> 01:25:47,180
I threw it.
Are you calling me A liar again?

1598
01:25:47,182 --> 01:25:51,484
Randy, i've, uh,
Had it the whole time.

1599
01:25:51,486 --> 01:25:54,921
Wait a second.
This is my grandma's Cubic zirconium...

1600
01:25:54,923 --> 01:25:57,589
I mean, diamond.

1601
01:25:57,591 --> 01:26:00,692
So i thought It was just The box that i threw.

1602
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:02,661
I guess it...

1603
01:26:02,663 --> 01:26:05,663
So we're doin' this?
I mean, we're...

1604
01:26:05,665 --> 01:26:07,464
We're really
Getting married.

1605
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:09,867
I guess so.
Okay.

1606
01:26:09,869 --> 01:26:12,335
Well, first things first.

1607
01:26:13,771 --> 01:26:18,107
Oh! This feels good.
It feels like, It feels right.

1608
01:26:18,109 --> 01:26:19,908
That's the wrong finger.

1609
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:22,077
Of course it is.
Let me try that again.

1610
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:24,179
All right.

1611
01:26:24,181 --> 01:26:27,081
It feels right, Doesn't it?
It feels perfect.

1612
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:29,483
Still the wrong finger.
Okay, we'll try That again.

1613
01:26:29,485 --> 01:26:31,818
It would be This finger.
I know that.

1614
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:33,620
So i guess this means
We should kiss.

1615
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:36,289
Okay. Yeah. I mean,
It's standard.

1616
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,457

Kissed a woman.

1648
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:49,137
Forget it. Action.

1649
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:51,304
Chicken.

1650
01:28:51,306 --> 01:28:53,506
That was it.

1651
01:28:53,508 --> 01:28:56,776
It just came to me
One night.

1652
01:28:56,778 --> 01:29:00,479
Flavor number 32,
Chicken ice cream.

1653
01:29:00,481 --> 01:29:03,581
Everybody loves chicken.
Everybody eats chicken.

1654
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:07,252
You put the rainbow
Sprinkles on it for the kids,

1655
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:08,920
Call it chicken salad.

1656
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:11,989
I know it sounds...
That sounds silly.

1657
01:29:11,991 --> 01:29:14,691
So anyway, the studio...

1658
01:29:14,693 --> 01:29:18,560
Uh, pretty much went under,

1659
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,397
And i lost pretty much
Everything i had,

1660
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:23,765
But it was
A blessing in disguise,

1661
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:26,301
Because i think
It gave me the time

1662
01:29:26,303 --> 01:29:30,871
To really pursue
My calling,

1663
01:29:30,873 --> 01:29:34,408
My life calling
Which is, of course,

1664
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,511
Opening up
My ice cream shop again,

1665
01:29:38,513 --> 01:29:43,516
And i called it
32 flavors.

1666
01:29:43,518 --> 01:29:46,151
Beat that,
Mr. Robbins.

1667
01:29:46,153 --> 01:29:48,687
Actually, i think
They have 50 flavors now.

1668
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:51,555
Oh, 50 flavors.
What are you talking about?

1669
01:29:51,557 --> 01:29:53,691
No, they do.
They have, Like, 50 flavors.

1670
01:29:53,693 --> 01:29:56,727
Don't say that.
Don't say it again.

1671
01:29:56,729 --> 01:29:59,562
You know, we really
Only need one camera here.

1672
01:29:59,564 --> 01:30:01,865
If you'd put your camera
Down, please, and leave.

1673
01:30:01,867 --> 01:30:03,967
I'm trying to speak
To the...

1674
01:30:03,969 --> 01:30:06,335
Just put it down.
I'm sorry.

1675
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:09,338
I'm starting to sweat.

1676
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:18,379
Fifty flavors.
Who told her that? Shit.

1677
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:22,582
So we wrapped on The tricycle picture,
It went great.

1678
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:26,052
No one actually watched it,
Which was good because

1679
01:30:26,054 --> 01:30:30,122
I'm actually trying
To let that part of me go.

1680
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:34,625
The film was not About my cousin.
It was about me.

1681
01:30:34,627 --> 01:30:38,596
I'm so proud Of you, honey.
Thanks, babe.

1682
01:30:38,598 --> 01:30:40,731
But i am working on
A brand-new script.

1683
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:43,167
It's wonderful.
It's about a small boy Who's afraid of fire,

1684
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:47,603
Because his dad would Actually
put out cigars On his neck.

1685
01:30:47,605 --> 01:30:49,739
That one's about
My cousin.

1686
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:52,108
That one's about
My cousin, so...

1687
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:54,009
So, we're married now.

1688
01:30:54,011 --> 01:30:57,812
Yeah, it's goin' great.
What else is new?

1689
01:30:57,814 --> 01:31:00,948
Oh, yeah, we had
Coitus last night.

1690
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,850
Yes, we did.

1691
01:31:02,852 --> 01:31:07,187
But, baby,
can you Never call it coitus Ever again?

1692
01:31:07,189 --> 01:31:08,989
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, babe.

1693
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:12,692
Hey, i'm gonna go Get that coffee for you.
She's a coffee nut.

1694
01:31:14,027 --> 01:31:17,997
So... I think marriage life
Is really good for us.

1695
01:31:17,999 --> 01:31:19,664
Especially randy.

1696
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:23,968
He's changed so much,
You probably wouldn't Even recognize him.

1697
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,604
He's really learning
How to deal with his past.

1698
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:29,472
He's really maturing.

1699
01:31:29,474 --> 01:31:32,309
He's just growing up.

1700
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:34,577
Randy?

1701
01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:36,745
Are you getting sleepy?

1702
01:31:42,786 --> 01:31:46,254
You shut up, You shut up.
Pecker, pecker!

1703
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:49,856
Pecker. Yah, yah.
Pecker, pecker.

1704
01:31:49,858 --> 01:31:53,894
Now i'm tired,
And daddy's gonna Take a piss.

1705
01:31:55,296 --> 01:31:58,197
So wes and i decided
To start a production company.

1706
01:31:58,199 --> 01:32:01,301
It's going great.
I'm finally living Out my dreams,

1707
01:32:01,303 --> 01:32:03,001
Which is amazing.

1708
01:32:03,003 --> 01:32:05,037
With wes and ben's,
You're getting An amazing deal.

1709
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:08,307
We can take your script And make it into A blockbuster.

1710
01:32:08,309 --> 01:32:10,774
I'm talking big.
Let me talk about quality.

1711
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:13,577
Capital "q."

1712
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:22,052
Why are you crying?

1713
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:30,058
Yes. I'm gonna enjoy this.

1714
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:33,094
So i'm still learning
American law.

1715
01:32:33,096 --> 01:32:36,331
Apparently you need
Some kind of a permit

1716
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:38,498
So that you can
Carry a gun.

1717
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,134
And they don't like it When you shoot someone,
I can tell you that.

1718
01:32:41,136 --> 01:32:45,771
I went abroad,
And i'm rooming with lester.

1719
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:48,174
In a cell with lester.

1720
01:32:48,176 --> 01:32:51,542
But you know,
We got a theater group goin'.

1721
01:32:51,544 --> 01:32:54,512
<i>Everybody's involved.
It's mamma mia!</i>

1722
01:32:54,514 --> 01:32:58,182
Yeah, but we've had to
Push it back.

1723
01:32:58,184 --> 01:33:02,086
Our lead guy Got stabbed in
the showers By the understudy.

1724
01:33:02,088 --> 01:33:06,322
Apparently picked up
The wrong piece of soap.

1725
01:33:08,293 --> 01:33:11,126
The show will go on.

1726
01:33:18,566 --> 01:33:20,634
I know. It's okay.
You want whipped cream.

1727
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:24,038
I hope you just didn't Miss your
chance To read your poem.

1728
01:33:31,844 --> 01:33:35,114
This is unbelievable.
Everyone else sees This, right?

1729
01:33:35,116 --> 01:33:36,982
You are a nightmare.

1730
01:33:36,984 --> 01:33:38,983
An absolute nightmare
To work with.

1731
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:41,685
Yeah, cheryl.
Why don't you Say something?

1732
01:33:41,687 --> 01:33:43,521
Come on, cheryl.
Say something.

1733
01:33:43,523 --> 01:33:45,522
I'm on my period, I'm grouchy,
I don't wanna talk.

1734
01:33:45,524 --> 01:33:47,557
So i know randy's an idiot,

1735
01:33:47,559 --> 01:33:50,760
But he did help me
To find my gift.

1736
01:33:50,762 --> 01:33:52,861
My gift of makeup.

1737
01:33:52,863 --> 01:33:54,863
I started my own
Makeup line.

1738
01:33:54,865 --> 01:33:57,366
I actually named it
After randy.

1739
01:33:57,368 --> 01:34:00,535
It's called... Ignorance.

1740
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:06,141
Randy doesn't get it,
But, oh well.

1741
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,879
Booger!

1742
01:34:15,015 --> 01:34:17,150
He was trying
To make me laugh.

1743
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,585
Apparently, there was
Some mix-up thing

1744
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:21,486
With randy
And the internet.

1745
01:34:21,488 --> 01:34:26,291
I solved that problem
For him, and i'm married.

1746
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,859
Reached my ultimate goal.

1747
01:34:28,861 --> 01:34:31,895
So... Where is she from?

1748
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:35,432
Uh...

1749
01:34:35,434 --> 01:34:38,801
The republic
Of yugoslavia.

1750
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:41,036
Not from around here.

1751
01:34:41,038 --> 01:34:43,539
It's funny
How these things work out.

1752
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:45,740
Because i actually
Was thinking about

1753
01:34:45,742 --> 01:34:47,841
Buying a wife
On the internet.

1754
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:50,644
But my credit card--
I was way, way over the limit,

1755
01:34:50,646 --> 01:34:53,214
So when randy came
To me with this,

1756
01:34:53,216 --> 01:34:55,082
I jumped on it, so...

1757
01:34:55,084 --> 01:34:58,251
Originally, i was
Gonna go asian,

1758
01:34:58,253 --> 01:35:03,122
But i think this actually
Worked out better for me.

1759
01:35:03,124 --> 01:35:06,892
So, um... And we're
Really, really happy.

1760
01:35:06,894 --> 01:35:11,329
We are...
You're happy, right?

1761
01:35:19,837 --> 01:35:23,005
I've never been fired
So many times in a day.

1762
01:35:23,007 --> 01:35:24,940
Cut.

1763
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:28,211
I'm pumped.
I'm friggin' pumped.

1764
01:35:28,213 --> 01:35:30,678
Listen to this.
I got a job as a disc jockey.

1765
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,314
I'm bart the deejay.

1766
01:35:32,316 --> 01:35:35,750
That's tight, right?
I'm working for z94.3 fm.

1767
01:35:35,752 --> 01:35:37,718
They gave me
This cool time slot.

1768
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,354
I'm working mondays,
2:00 to 5:00 a.M.

1769
01:35:40,356 --> 01:35:42,623
I'm doin' this thing
On the air now.

1770
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:46,259
I'm, like, what up? Boom.
I'm goin' bart-listic on you.

1771
01:35:46,261 --> 01:35:50,095
Everyone in the studio's,
Like, that's tight.

1772
01:35:50,097 --> 01:35:52,097
I'm pretty much coverin'
All the big stuff.

1773
01:35:52,099 --> 01:35:55,267
I'm doin' intersections,
Cars, water main breaks.

1774
01:35:55,269 --> 01:35:57,901
I'm doing traffic.
Mostly traffic.

1775
01:35:57,903 --> 01:36:00,204
But let's be honest.

1776
01:36:00,206 --> 01:36:02,806
Being on the radio Doesn't hurt
in The ass department, right?

1777
01:36:02,808 --> 01:36:05,642
Boom! We're gettin'
Bart-listic on you.

1778
01:36:07,978 --> 01:36:12,314
Musical.

1779
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:14,250
Marker.

1780
01:36:19,188 --> 01:36:21,922
Wes' ideas
Are very good,

1781
01:36:21,924 --> 01:36:24,724
And i should
Listen to him more.

1782
01:36:24,726 --> 01:36:26,726
Is that too many metaphors?

1783
01:36:26,728 --> 01:36:30,197
Maybe it is.

1784
01:36:32,766 --> 01:36:35,268
Why aren't you laughin'?

1785
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:37,403
Why couldn't i have
Thought of that first?

1786
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:41,139
Hit the deck!

1787
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:45,942
He started to struggle,
And i started to Beat him in the head,

1788
01:36:45,944 --> 01:36:48,379
Again and again and again.

1789
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:54,484
But they ordered us
To do it.

1790
01:36:54,486 --> 01:36:57,119
Bobby? What's his name?

1791
01:36:57,121 --> 01:37:00,088
It's randy.
Randy?

1792
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:01,690
Randy?

1793
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:06,294
'Cause i'm uncomfortable Being
nude in front of Other people.

1794
01:37:06,296 --> 01:37:09,597
Never let go.
Promise you'll Never let go.

1795
01:37:09,599 --> 01:37:11,765
I got hot cocoa.

1796
01:37:11,767 --> 01:37:15,768
I'm starting to lose
My power of sight.

1797
01:37:16,904 --> 01:37:19,038
Oh, you got me.

1798
01:37:21,774 --> 01:37:23,375
Push it. Push
The fucking button!

1799
01:37:25,913 --> 01:37:28,112
Let me talk to him.

1800
01:37:28,114 --> 01:37:30,981
Dad, it's me. Listen,
What you're doing

1801
01:37:30,983 --> 01:37:32,417
Is a very brave thing.

1802
01:37:32,419 --> 01:37:34,251
So...

1803
01:37:34,253 --> 01:37:36,553
So stupid.
What a stupid opening.

1804
01:37:36,555 --> 01:37:39,356
Stupid, stupid.

1805
01:37:39,358 --> 01:37:41,557
...Over at
Craft services.

1806
01:37:43,094 --> 01:37:44,793
You screwed up
Big time, randy.

1807
01:37:44,795 --> 01:37:47,895
Can i help you?

1808
01:37:47,897 --> 01:37:50,064
Too late.

1809
01:37:50,066 --> 01:37:52,434
I think you're lost.

1810
01:37:52,436 --> 01:37:54,935
Did you call cut
Already?

1811
01:37:54,937 --> 01:37:57,971
Can i go home And get my contacts?
No!

1812
01:37:57,973 --> 01:38:01,608
Look right over there
At the card and read it.

1813
01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:04,344
Yeah, we speak english.

1814
01:38:04,346 --> 01:38:06,846
We just find it easier
To never do it.

1815
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:08,947
We don't have
To work very hard.

1816
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:11,650
We get out of jobs
That we don't wanna do.

1817
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:15,253
And they can't fire us.
That's a big plus.

1818
01:38:15,255 --> 01:38:17,455
Yeah. Very.

1819
01:38:17,457 --> 01:38:19,690
Can you guys Move your car?
It's in my spot.

1820
01:38:19,692 --> 01:38:21,658
<i>No ingles.</i>

01:38:25,929 --> 01:38:27,830
Great. I don't
Speak spanish.

1822
01:38:29,132 --> 01:38:32,334
So it's the big day.

Oh, i get it now.

01:38:51,918 --> 01:38:55,388
Action. I work best
Under pressure.

1829

1830
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,627
So it's the big day.
Oh!

1831
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:08,031
I didn't even mess up.
