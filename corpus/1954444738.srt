No, I'm telling you, this guy came
out of a tree up at Houdini's place.

369
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,363
And he tore my gold tooth out, look.

370
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,722
Can you give a description?

371
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,934
Yeah, yeah. He was
about three feet tall,

372
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,396
had a green suit, and striped socks,
and a little hat, and a little hat.

373
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,732
And I bet he had little gold
buckles on his little black shoes.

She's a great girl,
how could you do such a thing?

414

Well, you got drunk,
so I decided to break our date

The chump gets lured in,
he forgets everything else.

All he sees is that
money in front of him.

426
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,942
And then he gets
that look in his eye,

427
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,070
and you know he's a dead man.

428
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,889

- Cody!

1048
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,587
Are you all right.
What has he done to you?

1049
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,780
Surprise!

1050
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,467
Don't take another step.

1051
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,177
Cody, run! Get out of here.

1052
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,905
- I'm not leaving without you!
- Go!

1053
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,059
What will you do now, Cody?

1054
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,583
You think you can beat
me here in my home?

1055
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:10,759
Take your damn ring back,
I don't want it anymore.

1056
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,878
Run!

1057
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,244
A game of hide and seek. How lovely.

1058
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,845
(LAUGHS)

1059
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,398
You know you won't get out.

1060
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,991
(CACKLING)

1061
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,477
- (GASPS)
- Shh!

1062
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,146
Don't scream. He'll hear us.
Come on. We got to find a way out.

1063
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:50,875
- Cody, I've tried.
- We'll do it together. Now come on.

1064
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,460
That's what you think.

1065
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,498
We're right back where we started.

1066
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,458
There's got to be a way out of here.

1067
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:09,526
Let's try this one.

1068
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,345
Déjà vu.

1069
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,946
Ah.

1070
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:23,202
Let's try this one.

1071
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,631
What are we gonna do?

1072
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,133
I got an idea.

1073
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,914
Bridget?

1074
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:49,141
Bridget!

1075
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,716
Bridget!

1076
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,385
Ah! Are you all right?

1077
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,554
I saw him. I saw the leprechaun.

1078
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:03,264
- Where is he?
- He's back in the tunnels.

1079
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:06,016
I managed to get away. Come on.
You're not gonna believe this.

1080
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,518
But I actually found
a way out of here.

1081
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,854
- Well, let's go.
- Wait. Do you still have the coin?

1082
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:10,938
Yeah. Why?

1083
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,440
Leave the damn thing here.
That's all he wants.

1084
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,442
But, Bridget, as long as we have
the coin, he can't hurt us.

1085
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,736
- We're dead without the coin.
- No. Listen to me, Cody.

1086
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,573
If leaving the coin keeps
that creep from following us,

1087
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,158
we've got to do it.

1088
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:25,202
- But...
- No. I know it's scary.

1089
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,554
It'll be okay.

1090
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:33,019
Give me the coin and let's
get out of here, please.

1091
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,195
I love you, Cody.

1092
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,383
(BRIDGET LAUGHING)

1093
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,558
LEPRECHAUN: You lose. (LAUGHS)

1094
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,606
I fooled you. Now there's
nothing to protect you.

1095
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:20,090
I have the gold coin and
there's no stopping me now.

1096
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,384
You can't outsmart a genius.

1097
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,327
Where's Bridget?

1098
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,514
Don't hurt him.

1099
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:30,309
- I'll go with you.
- Yes, you will.

1100
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:34,897
But first it's time to finish this
annoying boy off once and for all.

1101
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,874
Like hell.

1102
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:43,305
BRIDGET: Cody! No!

1103
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,932
Cody, no!

1104
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,678
He's dead?

1105
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,587
It's over?

1106
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,860
It's really over?

1107
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,552
Cry as you may. Cry as you might.

1108
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:08,530
It's gonna be one hell
of a wedding night.

1109
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,951
In your dreams.

1110
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,707
Ahhh!

1111
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,735
Real milk chocolate, genius.

1112
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,336
Ahhh!

1113
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,469
He's gonna blow.

1114
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,392
(ENERGY CRACKLING)

1115
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,989
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

1116
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,809
How did you know it wasn't me
you gave the coin to before?

1117
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,831
He kisses differently than you.

1118
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,235
Whose kiss you like better?

1119
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,903
I'll have to think about it.

1120
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,504
(BOTH LAUGH)

1121
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,675
BRIDGET: Are you gonna keep it?

1122
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,849
Trust me, it's not worth it.
