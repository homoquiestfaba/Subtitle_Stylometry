1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,760
- To a wonderful film. You were great.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,000
- What a romantic you are.
- To the agency and my little protege.

3
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,000
Bless you.
Thank you, daddy.

4
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,600
Eight years at Berlitz,
that's what you learn?

5
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,480
He learned chin the first month
and then chin-chin.

6
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,440
Am I right?

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,920
I can't be clever.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,080
It was really beautiful,
what you guys did.

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,120
It was beautiful,
and you guys are great.

10
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
I love the food here.

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,120
The nicest thing about the film
is that we get to handle guns.

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
- I had never done that.
- Peter.

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
- Very rare.
- What?

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,120
- How are you?
- Wow. Ben, how are you?

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
Outstanding, sir.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Excuse me.
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,040
- Of course.
- How are you?

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,880
- Sheila.
- Ladies.

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,560
- Hi, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,320
I'm a big fan of your writing.
I thought Bay of Pigs was great.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,880
Actually, I didn't write it,
I just got the credit. I was fired.

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,400
Didn't I talk to you a couple
of years ago when you both worked...

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,920
- at MGM with Laddie?
- That's right, by God.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,920
So are you still at ICM?

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,080
- I'm at TriStar.
- You're at TriStar.

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,920
- You'll have to say hello to Mike.
- I will.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,440
He's not there anymore,
but I'll hunt him down.

28
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,440
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,280
- Please?
- Be right back.

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,920
Hold the fort, kiddo.
I have my own office this way.

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,520
- What is the matter with him?
- He's sick.

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,880
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,720
This is the last time. I promise.
I just need some cash tonight.

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,800
- How are you?
- I lost my credit cards.

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
The money will be on your desk
first thing in the morning.

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,720
How's the new one coming along?
I hear you got Dickie Gere.

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
- That is great, man.
- I got everybody in the movie.

38
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,560
Look, you're sick.

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,080
This is all I have in cash.

40
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Please, don't drink it in here.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,840
- Man.
- That's fine, Peter.

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
I'll messenger it over to you
in the morning.

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,400
I don't want it.

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,760
I think it would be the best thing
if you don't contact me again.

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,520
- What's your name?
- Terri.

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,520
- Terri, I am going to buy you a drink.
- I'm okay. Thanks.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
Bud, please. Buy the lady a drink
and another one for you.

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,160
I'm Benjamin. Ben.

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,560
Benny Goodman, that's me.
I think you're sexy. That's right.

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Look at those eyes.
Sexy like a kitty cat.

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,200
You turn me on

52
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,400
You're not too tall
You're not too short

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,240
You're not too round

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,920
You're like a cat
The cat in the hat

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
Look at those eyes.
Honest to God.

56
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,080
You're luminescent, baby.
What?

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,920
- You've been drinking all day.
- Of course.

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,560
Speaking of drinks,
here is yours.

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,080
- Thanks.
- Down that hatch.

60
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,600
And here is mine.
Cheers. Come on.

61
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,080
There we go.
Let's do it to it.

62
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,440
I just thought
of an amazing concept.

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,640
What do you say
we finish these...

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,760
and we go back
to my apartment on the beach!

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,160
I'll throw a movie in the VCR...

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,120
and mix you up
a gooey blender drink.

67
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,520
Sound good? Sound sexy?

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,840
Bud, give me another.

69
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
I really wish you'd come home with me.
You're so cute.

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm really good in bed too.
Believe me.

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,920
And you smell great...

72
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,920
and you look great
and your hair's great.

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
Look, I've got to wake up early
in the morning.

74
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,760
I have to go. Thank you.

75
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,520
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

76
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,000
Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much.

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,840
That's it, pal.
We're closing up now.

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm gonna finish this.

79
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey, Mr. Erection,
you want a date?

80
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,920
The room is 20.
You pay for it.

81
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,680
But only because I think...

82
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,040
that the concept of surrender...

83
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,720
fits with the big picture right now.

84
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
Hey, get outta the street!

85
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,360
I don't remember
if I started drinking...

86
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,200
because my wife left me or...

87
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,560
my wife left me
'cause I started drinking.

88
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
Fuck it anyway!

89
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,520
Next, please.

90
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,720
One moment, sir.

91
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,160
Sign the back
of the check, please.

92
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,720
- Can't you just cash it as it is?
- Is there a problem?

93
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
I'm a little shaky right now.

94
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,360
I had brain surgery.

95
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,520
I'll go get some lunch,
and then I'll come back...

96
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,080
and take care of it then.

97
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,200
Next I'll have a gin and tonic.

98
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,200
Do you know what time it is?

99
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,720
You should be drinking coffee.

100
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
You're a young guy.

101
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,880
It's none of my business...

102
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,240
but if you could see
what I see...

103
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
you wouldn't be doing this
to yourself.

104
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,680
I understand
what you're saying.

105
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,520
I appreciate your concern.

106
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,000
It's not my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

107
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,520
Please, serve me today,
and I'll never come in here again.

108
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,680
If I do, you can 86 me.

109
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
Stop fucking with me!

110
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,200
I can 86 you anytime I want to.

111
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,720
I don't give a fuck what you do.

112
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
That one's on the house, son.

113
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
Were you in Los Angeles
for the earthquake?

114
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,080
- It was pretty scary.
- Did you have a lot of damage?

115
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
- Just a little bit.
- Are you desirable?

116
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,480
Are you irresistible?

117
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,840
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me,
it would help.

118
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,440
If you kissed me, and I could taste
the sting in your mouth, it would help.

119
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,200
If you drank bourbon with me naked...

120
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,160
if you smelled of bourbon
as you fucked me, it would help.

121
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,320
It would increase
my esteem for you...

122
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,120
if you poured bourbon on your naked body
and said to me, "Drink this".

123
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,280
If you spread your legs and you had
bourbon dripping from your breasts...

124
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,160
and your pussy and said,
"Drink here"...

125
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,360
then I could
fall in love with you.

126
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,880
Because then I would have a purpose:
to clean you up.

127
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,280
And that would prove...

128
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,720
that I'm worth something.

129
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,360
I'd lick you clean so that you could
go away and fuck someone else.

130
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,400
Our business is
to make our customers happy.

131
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,440
Next, please.

132
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,760
I am back.

133
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,640
I've got my check,
and, baby, I'm ready to sign.

134
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,480
There.

135
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Steady as a fucking rock.
Excuse my French.

136
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,000
Want to have dinner with me?

137
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,000
But what's the back end like?

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,400
By the time we're through
with P and A...

139
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,320
the "above the line"
is gonna take it to about 15.

140
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,360
With something like this,
what would Disney think?

141
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,880
Messages.

142
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,200
What did Diller say?

143
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,040
Listen, I'm very busy.
Just kidding.

144
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,680
Can I call you back on this?

145
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,200
Ciao for now.

146
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,720
Could somebody fix the phones
around here?

147
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
- Good morning.
- Mr. Simpson's looking for you.

148
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,080
He wants you to go in
as soon as you get...

149
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,320
- Are you all right?
- Outstanding.

150
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,160
But I have to go
to a very important meeting.

151
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,680
Could make a couple million
for the company.

152
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,520
What?

153
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,360
You should go in there now.

154
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,360
- Hi, Bill.
- Take a seat.

155
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,080
We're gonna let you go.

156
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,160
This is too generous, Bill.

157
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,640
We really liked having you around,
but you know how it is.

158
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm sorry.

159
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,000
What are you gonna do now?

160
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,520
I thought...

161
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,520
I thought
I'd move out to Las Vegas.

162
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,000
My name is Yuri Botsov.

163
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,160
Where you from, Yuri?

164
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,720
You sure don't sound like you come
from around these parts.

165
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,320
That is very true.

166
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Very good observation.
I am from Latvia.

167
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
Very tough place.

168
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,000
I hear this,
but I am not a tough man.

169
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,480
I am a humble man who is here to learn
from my friends in the New World.

170
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,960
This must be Yuri's friend.

171
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,760
Sera is my gift to you all.

172
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,320
You will find her a very willing girl
for each of you...

173
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,480
just as we arranged.

174
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,160
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

175
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,960
Do you wanna watch?

176
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,120
Are you scared?

177
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,280
It's all right.

178
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,960
It's okay.

179
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,280
I bring out the best
in the men who fuck me.

180
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,960
It's not easy,
but I'm very good.

181
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,560
It's amazing. I haven't worked
for a really long time...

182
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,240
and I can just turn on a dime.

183
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,520
I can just become
who they want me to be.

184
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,240
I walk into that room,
I know right away...

185
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,560
this is their fantasy,
and I become it.

186
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm that service.
I perform it, and I perform it well.

187
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm an equation mostly.

188
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,760
Thirty minutes of my body
costs $300.

189
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,080
That's just to get into the room.

190
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
It's about $500 after that.
We negotiate.

191
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,400
But it's a performance.

192
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,000
It's definitely a performance.

193
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,760
I am very pleased with how
you've moved up in the world.

194
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,520
It is, after all,
a glamorous world I showed you.

195
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,960
Why did you leave me
in Los Angeles?

196
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,440
Because you are sly.

197
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,640
You knew there was more money
here in Las Vegas.

198
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,640
You don't need to fear me, Sera...

199
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,960
because we belong together.

200
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,480
Don't we?

201
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,280
- Are you lonely?
- I am lonely, Yuri.

202
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120
So am l.

203
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,760
Janek, we called you last night!

204
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,080
There was no one home.

205
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,920
We're 30 miles
outside of Las Vegas.

206
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,960
Someone saw him there yesterday.

207
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,800
No, this is the end of it!

208
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,400
Yuri knew what he was doing.

209
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,920
That was a red light.

210
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,920
I walk, you stop.

211
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
Are you sorry?

212
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,160
Good.

213
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,200
Three towels in each room
and a complimentary bar of soap.

214
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,240
If you run out of soap,
you can buy an extra bar.

215
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,840
Feel free to use our pool,
but use it at your own risk.

216
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,080
- There are three towels in your room.
- Do you have vacancies?

217
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,560
We do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

218
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,560
Linens are provided for you.
Rooms are $29 a night.

219
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,760
You pay at the beginning of each week.
Maid service is optional.

220
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,600
Maid service is optional.
It costs $3.50 a day.

221
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,760
Feel free to use the pool,
but use it at your own risk.

222
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,920
We don't have a lifeguard.

223
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,920
No kids, no pets and no guests
after 11:00 at night.

224
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,920
You've been provided
with three towels.

225
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,960
We expect when you check out
there will still be three towels.

226
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
There's a complimentary
bar of soap.

227
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,680
I walked into the room,
and he was lying on the bed.

228
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,040
He had his arms
behind his head...

229
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,520
and there was
just hair everywhere.

230
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,400
He was really, really fat.

231
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,800
He had a large erection.

232
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,480
I remember he was so proud
of his large erection.

233
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,640
I asked him where my money was,
and he pointed to the dresser.

234
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,480
And then I asked him
what he wanted...

235
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,000
and he said,
"Lie down, I'm on top".

236
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,480
He started pounding me
really hard.

237
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,680
I had to bite my tongue
to keep from crying.

238
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,320
He did that for awhile,
and then I started to get up.

239
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,160
He pushed me back down,
and he held my hair.

240
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,680
He was pulling it,
and he stuck his penis in my mouth.

241
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,280
I tried to get up again,
and he said...

242
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,360
"Stay there, baby,
I'm gonna come on your face".

243
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,960
So he did.

244
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,960
Then he rubbed his semen
all over my face and in my hair.

245
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,240
Then he kicked me off the bed
and told me to leave.

246
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,080
- Are you working?
- What do you mean? I'm walking.

247
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Just wait one second.

248
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,480
Great ass!

249
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,600
- Want some?
- Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?

250
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,920
That's pretty funny.

251
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,600
I wonder if you'll take $250
to fuck me?

252
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,920
That is, if you'll come
to my room for one hour...

253
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,280
I will give you $500.

254
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,600
- You're pretty drunk.
- Not really.

255
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,240
My room's not far.
It's The Whole Year lnn.

256
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,360
You could drive with me if you want
or we could walk.

257
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,080
Or I could give you cab fare.

258
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,760
- In the car.
- Whatever you want.

259
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,240
Why don't you give me the money
in the car?

260
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,440
I'm Ben.

261
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
I'm Sera.

262
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,720
Sarah with an "H"?

263
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,400
With an "E". S-e-r-a.

264
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,240
You wanna start the engine?

265
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,400
What this room needs
is more booze.

266
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,400
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

267
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,680
Want a drink?
I'm having one.

268
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,440
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila,
if you can spare it.

269
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
Your drink's here.

270
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,080
For 500 bucks, you can do
pretty much whatever you want.

271
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,920
- You can fuck my ass.
- Oh, my God.

272
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,800
You can come on my face.
Whatever you want to do.

273
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,560
Just keep it out of my hair.
I just washed it.

274
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,680
Just because my feet
were too big in the morning

275
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,120
Just because I can't remember
your mother's name

276
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,600
Just because I put the octopus
in the bed

277
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,520
Just because, because
because, because Bill Cosby

278
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
You wanna fuck now?

279
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,560
Maybe something to drink first.
More tequila?

280
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,040
Whatever.

281
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,640
What's the story?
Are you too drunk to come?

282
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,760
I don't care about any of that.

283
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,600
There's time left.
You can have more money.

284
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,600
You can drink all you want.

285
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,760
Just stay.
That's what I want.

286
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,880
I want you to talk or listen.

287
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,440
Just stay.

288
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,720
So, Ben with an "N"...

289
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,960
what brings you to Las Vegas?

290
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,560
Business convention?

291
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,920
I came here
to drink myself to death.

292
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Cashed in all my money...

293
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,880
paid my American Express card...

294
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,040
gonna sell the car tomorrow.

295
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,720
How long is it gonna take
for you to...

296
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,240
drink yourself to death?

297
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think about four weeks.

298
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,560
I don't know for sure,
but I think.

299
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,440
I got enough
for about 250, $300 a day.

300
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,440
That should do it.

301
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,760
What am l? A luxury?

302
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,480
You're a luxury,
and your meter just ran out.

303
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,720
That's a nice watch.

304
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,240
You do like it?

305
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,360
You can talk
a little bit more.

306
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,720
I don't have to be anywhere.

307
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Talk.

308
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,200
In Los Angeles...

309
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,240
I kept running out of booze
and the store would be closed...

310
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,480
because I forget
to look at my watch.

311
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,560
I used to live in Los Angeles.

312
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,320
But I don't anymore.

313
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,600
I think the tough times
are finally behind me.

314
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,880
There'll always
be bad things, but...

315
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,280
my life is good.

316
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,800
It is as I want it to be.

317
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,600
It's good.

318
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,000
It's good being here with you.

319
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,040
Shit.

320
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,920
Hey, Bill.
How are you?

321
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,040
Is this a full night's work?

322
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,520
I'm really sorry.

323
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,800
It was such a slow night,
and I couldn't score.

324
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
What do you think?

325
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,240
You're just a 16-year-old girl
on Hollywood Boulevard?

326
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,240
Is that what you think?
ls that what you play?

327
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Here.

328
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,120
Go ahead.

329
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,680
I could kill you, Sera.

330
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,720
You work tonight,
and you bring me the money.

331
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,920
It doesn't matter how late.

332
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
I will.

333
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,400
He cut me a couple of times.

334
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,040
He'd always say,
"Never on the face".

335
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,920
So, he cut me right here.

336
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,240
He cried...

337
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,520
and I felt sorry for him.

338
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,840
In his mind,
I'd done something bad...

339
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,520
but in my mind
I hadn't done anything bad.

340
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,680
He's kind of paranoid.

341
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,160
This ring is a ruby.
It's my lucky ring.

342
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,880
This watch is real gold.
It's not plated.

343
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,320
It's the real thing.
Feel how heavy it is.

344
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,320
- These rings, $3,000.
- One thousand.

345
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,400
One thousand?
Look what you're getting.

346
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,640
It's a ruby. It's my lucky ring.
It's a beautiful thing.

347
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,880
I can put that in.
Two thousand dollars.

348
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,880
- I can't give you more than a thousand.
- But I just added the ring.

349
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,120
- Synthetic ruby.
- Look...

350
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,440
What can I do for you?

351
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Five hundred.

352
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,480
Five hundred dollars
for a 1993 Rolex Daytona watch.

353
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,000
I'll do it.

354
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,360
- How are you doin'?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

355
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,040
Are you here for the convention?

356
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,120
I didn't think I was that obvious.

357
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,800
- It was just a wild guess.
- My name's Paul, honey.

358
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,360
- Vodka Seven.
- And for the lady?

359
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,920
- Are you ready for another one?
- Sure.

360
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,200
- I'll have a margarita.
- Good choice.

361
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,000
Are you alone?

362
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,800
Or are you using me
to make someone jealous?

363
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Alone. I'm here alone.

364
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,960
Thank you.

365
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,120
Cheers.

366
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,160
Where are you staying?

367
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,520
Right here at the hotel.
Why?

368
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,520
I thought
you might be looking for a date.

369
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,000
"A date"?
What are you, a hooker?

370
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,600
What exactly do you mean
by a date?

371
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,840
I got a wife waiting
for me at home.

372
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,840
- I just came over to talk.
- I'm sorry. I guess I misunderstood.

373
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,680
- I guess you did.
- Just keep your voice down.

374
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,040
I won't bother you again.

375
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Here, have another one on me.

376
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,360
Christ.

377
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,880
Maybe you should give it a miss
for tonight.

378
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't know, it's just...

379
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,040
I really like this guy.
I've never felt anything...

380
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:53,880
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

381
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,960
It's weird.
I feel kind of confused about it.

382
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,440
We were with each other
only one night...

383
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,720
but I felt like
the relationship...

384
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,080
I felt like there was
a relationship being formed.

385
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
I was kind of scared.

386
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,560
I don't think
I should see him again.

387
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,640
But I look for him.

388
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,640
I went out last night.
I was looking for him.

389
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,480
Where's your car?

390
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,080
I sold it this morning.

391
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm gonna take cabs from now on.

392
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,800
What's it tonight?
Another 500 to watch you sleep?

393
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,400
- What's up?
- I was looking for you tonight.

394
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,400
I don't know
if you have a boyfriend...

395
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,240
or a girlfriend...

396
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,240
but, if you have
some free time...

397
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,880
I thought maybe
we could get some dinner.

398
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,320
Are you serious?

399
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,800
I think you know I'm serious.

400
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,400
I'll pay you if you like,
but I just want to see you.

401
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,040
I can't have dinner with you.

402
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,360
We could get prime rib.

403
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,200
They've got it on sale for $2.99.

404
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,720
I love that dress.

405
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,880
I had a really good night.

406
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,560
I think things
are finally picking up.

407
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,640
We made so much money.
Look.

408
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,360
Come here.

409
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,400
Now listen.
Do you hear?

410
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,920
They're talking about me.

411
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
Are you all right?

412
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,360
Get out.

413
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,440
Do not come back here.
I'll not see you again.

414
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,040
Do you still wanna have dinner?

415
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,880
I think I put too much salt on it.

416
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,520
- It's not good.
- It's good.

417
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,720
- Why are you a drunk?
- Why am I a drunk?

418
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,320
Is that really
what you want to ask me?

419
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,720
Then this is our first date
or our last.

420
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,240
Until now,
I wasn't sure it was either.

421
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,240
First.

422
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,240
It's our first.

423
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,200
I just wanna know.

424
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,920
Why are you killing yourself?

425
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,360
Interesting choice of words.

426
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,520
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

427
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,080
Is your drinking a way
to kill yourself?

428
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,840
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

429
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,040
Shoot.

430
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,040
Can I have another one?

431
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,680
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

432
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,800
Good night.

433
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,680
- I had the most wonderful...
- Why don't you stay at my place tonight?

434
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,760
Look, you're pretty drunk.

435
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,720
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

436
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,280
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

437
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,120
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

438
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,520
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

439
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,520
We'll talk about it tonight
at my place.

440
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,760
I'm not much good in the sack.

441
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,840
It's not about sex.

442
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,320
I'll make you up a bed
on the sofa.

443
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,960
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

444
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,960
As you know,
I am my own boss.

445
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,560
Do it, Ben.

446
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,680
I'll do it.

447
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,040
This is the home of an angel.

448
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,040
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

449
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,560
You look extremely beautiful.

450
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,640
I do?

451
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,240
It's really weird because...

452
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,080
you know...

453
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,920
it's just like
this thing's happening...

454
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,920
really quickly.

455
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,200
I just don't know
what's going on.

456
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,080
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

457
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,520
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

458
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,200
And it's just...

459
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,840
It's all happening really quickly.

460
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,880
I just felt like
we've been together for a long time.

461
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,040
It just felt so easy...

462
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,360
and I felt like...

463
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,880
I felt like I was me.

464
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,400
I didn't feel like I was...

465
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,400
trying to be somebody else.

466
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,000
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

467
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,000
What do you mean?

468
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,680
I think you should go
and bring all your stuff over here.

469
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,800
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

470
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,240
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

471
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,880
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

472
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,320
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

473
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,480
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

474
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,840
Right now I feel really good.

475
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,920
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

476
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,280
But that won't last forever.

477
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,560
All right,
you go back to your motel.

478
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,440
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

479
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,000
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash...

480
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,560
to take the taste
of come out of my mouth.

481
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,200
I'm tired of being alone.
That's what I'm tired of.

482
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,280
Don't you like me, Ben?

483
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,120
What you don't understand is...
No. See? No.

484
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,880
What?

485
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,840
You can never, never...

486
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,360
ask me to stop drinking.

487
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,640
Do you understand?

488
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,200
I do.

489
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,000
I really do.

490
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,440
I'm nuts about you.
