hiding in plain sight like that.

186
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:38,862
I have a few questions.

187
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,129
For example,

188
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,200
where can I find
your BFF Poison Ivy?

189
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,204
We need your help.

190
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,039
- Ivy is...
- Save it, honey.

191
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,407
I don't mix it up with
the costume crowd anymore.

192
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,344
I turned over a new leaf,
as it were.

193
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,844
Listen,

194
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,814
Ivy's fallen in
with the wrong crowd.

195
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,882
She and Jason Woodrue
are up to something,

196
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,483
and we have to stop them.

197
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,453
They're a lethal combo,
Harley.

198
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,821
Lots of people
could get hurt or killed.

199
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,556
Ivy could get hurt or killed.

200
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,124
Nuh-uh.

201
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,326
I am done with capes
and tights and masks.

202
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:14,063
Just trying like hell
to lead a normal life.

203
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,199
Really?
Funny that you're not, say

204
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,867
using your
psychiatric training

205
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,268
to make a decent living,

206
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,503
instead of dressing up
in skimpy red and black

207
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,439
for a minimum wage, plus tips.

208
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,809
Pretty weird way
to kick a habit.

209
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,877
You've got to be just itching
to get back in the game.

210
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,315
Nice try, but you're
on your own, Nightwig.

211
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:36,252
You haven't reported to
your parole officer in months.

212
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,921
I should just drag
your crazy ass

213
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,321
back to jail right now.

214
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,023
Oh, yeah?

Sorry, kiddo, but you're
getting the payback

220

for every pinch,
goose and butt-slap

221
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,814
I've gotten
for the last three months.

Give up?

225
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,407
Just when things
are getting interesting?

226
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,444
Fat chance!

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

235
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,190
Some girls like Mace.

236
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:25,560
I prefer a little
low-grain Joker venom.

237
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,633
Only useful thing
I ever got from that ass-hat.

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,055
Don't know
what you expect to find.

My best people have been
over this place a dozen times.

243
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:02,632
No offense
to your best people,

244
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,135
but they're not me.

245
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,380
What is it?

246
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,480
Oh, yay, a leaf.

247
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,382
Kind of like all of these.

248
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:21,416
No,

249
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:22,752
not like those.

250
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,619
It's a completely
different phylum

251
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,555
from every other leaf in here.

252
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:29,758
Great, you're the world's
greatest florist, too.

253
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,227
Look closely.

254
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,165
Have you ever seen
a leaf like this?

255
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:35,732
Can't say that I have.

256
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,267
That's because
it isn't from our planet.

257
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,105
Not even from our dimension.

258
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,171
Wait, you mean

259
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,574
Jason Woodrue?

260
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,376
That freak was here?

00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,143
This is bad.

262
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,146
Your forensic people are bad.

263
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,214
This...

264
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,685
Is catastrophic.

265
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,554
Nightwing, this is Batman.
Come in.

00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,554

00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,756
Everything okay?

268
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,157
He should've
reported in by now.

You want me
to send out a search team?

Besides...

275
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,272
Nightwing can handle himself.

- (GROANS)
- HARLEY: I know, I know, freaking stupid.

277
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,411
Bringing him back to my place.

278
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,712
But what was I supposed to do?

279
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,347
I couldn't just let him go.

280
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,348
He knows the secret location
of my hidey-hole.

281
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,584
He'd blab to Batman for sure.

282
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,387
Could've just killed him,
dumbass.

283
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,321
HARLEY: Nah,
I'm not a criminal anymore.

284
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,557
Plus, he's kind of
too cute to kill.

285
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,592
And anyway,

286
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,493
maybe I should help out.

287
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,730
Sounds like Ivy could be in
some serious trouble...

288
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,498
Don't bother yelling for help.

289
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,435
This dump is condemned.

290
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,206
Nobody in the whole building
but us, Nightwig.

00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,208

292
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,340
Eh?

293
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:54,643
It's Nightwing.

294
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,079
Really?

295
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,613
Guess I was thinking of
that goofy mullet

296
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,482
you used to have.

297
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,517
Yeesh. That was like
a whole decade of bad-hair days.

298
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,319
Sticks and stones, lady.

299
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:06,088
I've taken trash talk from
bigger criminals than you.

300
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,390
"Criminals"?

301
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,191
If you hadn't noticed,
I went straight.

302
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,126
I'm a freaking waitress
already.

303
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,765
Oh, golly, that's right,
I stand corrected.

304
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,500
Check this out, smart guy.

got some dumb policy

00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:26,142
of not hiring former
costume super-villains.

308
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:29,112
Just like every other hospital
in the world.

309
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,813
There are other jobs.

310
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,449
Oh, sure.
I got a ton of offers.

311
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,485

You say I'm a criminal,

they say I'm a whore.

Well, I'm sick of other people
telling me what I am!

a heck of a workout.

Phew!

324
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,547
Definitely could use a shower.

325
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,717
I think better
when I don't reek.

326
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,285
Still got to figure out
what to do

327
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,489
about Nightwig over there.

328
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,221
Hmm, what to wear,

329
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,724
what to wear?

Hey, Nightwig,

337
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,605
is it true you
used to be Robin?

338
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:28,603
Hmph.

339
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:29,939
Ain't that
a kick in the pants.

340
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,876
Little boy-wonder
all grown up.

341
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,479
Okay, now...

342
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,614
Don't be getting
any funny ideas.

343
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:40,618
Too late.

344
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:43,585
It's funny.

345
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:45,688
I always kind of thought you
and Batman didn't like girls.

- You know, that book

with the headlights
and the eyeball-gouging,

348
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,362
I had to write a paper on it
back in college.

349
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:54,596
Got a B-minus.

350
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:55,864
Look, Harley, I...

351
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,600
Pretty lonely
these last few months,

352
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,201
if you know what I mean.

353
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,370
You don't meet
a lot of likely prospects

355
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,407

I don't want to,

Right now, I just really
need to find Poison...

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,285
Face it, sugar.

362
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,719
I got something you want,

363
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,823
and you sure as shooting
got something I want.

364
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,490
So, be a good boy,

365

I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1262
01:11:28,882 --> 01:11:32,018
It sounds to me
like you're a little bit blue.

1263
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,952
Oh, yeah?

1264
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:36,822
And that part about you being
wee-wee shy...

1265
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:38,558
That's rough.

1266
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,360
I had this cellmate at Arkham
with the same problem.

1267
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,594
I says to her,
"Sugar, we got a glass wall

1268
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:44,629
"and a toilet
in the middle of the floor.

1269
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:46,031
"You're in trouble."

(LAUGHING)

1271
01:11:48,036 --> 01:11:49,402
Can you help me?

1272
01:11:49,404 --> 01:11:51,036
Of course I can, silly.

1273
01:11:51,038 --> 01:11:54,005
I'm a regular

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1276
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:58,009
I'm legally required
to remind you

1277
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:00,112
that my doctorate
is purely honorary

1278
01:12:00,114 --> 01:12:02,850
and I'm not a currently
accredited mental-health professional.

1279
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,050
Okay.

1280
01:12:05,052 --> 01:12:07,919
Well, Wesey.
Okay if I call you Wesey?

1281
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:09,921
- I don't really like it.
- Well, Wesey...

1282
01:12:09,923 --> 01:12:12,157
- You could clearly benefit from therapy.

1283
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,093
I know I did.

1284
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:16,027
But one thing I learned is that
you never get the most out of stuff

1285
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:17,830
when it's just handed to you.

1286
01:12:17,832 --> 01:12:19,132
You gotta earn it.

Now, as everybody knows,

1289
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:26,873
the road to mental wellness
is paved with pit bulls.

1290
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,509
But all you got to do is
make it to that finish line

1291
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,811
way over there
to win a full year of therapy

1292
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:34,513

honest-to-goodness shrink.

I've got faith in you, Wesey.

Time to turn your life around and
start feeling good about yourself again!
