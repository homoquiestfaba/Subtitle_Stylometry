1
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,988
- Hey, hello there.
- Howdy.

2
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,690
- Did we miss anything?

3
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,893
- Nope, you're just in time.

4
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,369
- Stay away!

5
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,806
God.

6
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:05,509
Why?

7
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,293
God, why?

8
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,348
- Sorry, partner.

9
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,084
Nothing personal.

10
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:30,303
 

11
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,954
- Is it on?

12
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,923
- Relax, we're
rolling geek girl.

13
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,224
- You should talk.

14
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,527
You got me into this stuff.

15
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:14,798
- Oh, always a follower,
never a leader.

16
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:23,907
Pick of the week?

17
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,108
- "mischief night."

18
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:26,209
Jenny fields fights
Jack and Jill,

19
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,911
A supernatural goth duo.

20
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,080
As her friends die off
the town wonders,

21
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,182
"is Jenny the murderer?"

22
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,217
- You secretly wanna
be a monster hunter.

23
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,686
- Doesn't everybody...
what's your pick?

24
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,054
Come on, what's yours?

25
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:42,092
- All right...
come on.

26
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:45,095
"lady death..."
she kicks ass.

27
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,730
- She'll poke your eye
out with those boobs.

28
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:49,499
- Jealous?

29
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,037
Come on give me the Cam.

30
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:56,006
- Well, this is it,
the last hoorah

31
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,441
Of Megan and Abby Graves.

32
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:03,313
Meg's going to New York City
to become a marketing drone.

33
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:05,181
Bitch is abandoning me.

34
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,983
Nothing's gonna
be the same again.

35
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,952
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

36
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,121
You're breaking up the team.

37
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,922
What am I gonna do without you?

38
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,257
- I don't know.

39
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,693
You're hopeless.

40
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,428
- Hmm.

41
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,463
- Okay, see you next week.

42
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,965
Hey, you two coming
down on Saturday?

43
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,466
We're having a back issue sale.

44
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,969
- Can't, we're off to the
wilds of Arizona

45
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,738
To find the
"world's largest thermometer."

46
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,907
My life won't be
complete without it.

47
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:32,008
- Cool, cool.

48
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,346
- Do you see what
I have to endure?

49
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:38,014
- There you go.

50
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,617
- Dude, mom is gonna murder
you when she finds out.

51
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:44,988
- If mom finds out, I'll hunt
you down and kill you.

52
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,123
- Ladies and gentlemen, allow
me to introduce to you

53
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:50,593
The greatest power punk band
on the planet, calgary.

54
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,030
- Come on.

55
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:30,400
What's up?

56
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:34,003
- Dude, no means no.

57
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,807
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,909
- Kinda busy here.

59
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,345
- Yeah?

60
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:44,314
Busy find in your dick.

61
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,452
What's up with these morons?

62
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:52,021
- That's what I have you for.

63
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,702
This blows, Meg.

64
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,705
Why couldn't you
just work in Phoenix?

65
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,306
I love you.

66
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:13,009
And I miss you already.

67
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,746
And I know you're gonna
just kick ass in New York.

68
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,048
They don't stand a
chance against you.

69
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:22,919
I mean, who does?

70
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,060
- Can you please turn
that music off?

71
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,096
- I'll tell you what...
when you can kick ny ass,

72
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,497
You can change my tunes.

73
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:37,467
- Oh, great...
whatever.

74
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:41,404
Hey, look...
is that a vulture?

75
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:44,507
- The harbinger of doom.
- Great.

76
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:47,410
- No, it's not a vulture,
it's a hawk.

77
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,878
- Cool.

78
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,080
We could be at the
back issue sale.

79
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,851
But, no, you gotta
be adventure girl.

80
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:58,488
- I have the cutest toes
in the whole family.

81
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:01,658
- Oh.

82
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,227
Map quest us.
- I'm video recording.

83
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:07,263
- Map quest us.
- I will when I'm done.

84
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:09,566
- Abby.

85
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:14,473
- All right, where we at?
- Thirty Miles South of the 58.

86
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,943
- Yeah, we're out there.

87
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:36,860
- Do I have to do
everything myself?

88
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,328
- What?

89
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,497
- We have no service...
there is like zero bars.

90
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:49,505
- You know you're a sadist.

91
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,541
You're gonna miss
me, aren't ya?

92
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,744
- Oh, you wish.

93
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,647
You see any signs?
- None.

94
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:01,384
- Um, turn around.

95
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,991
- Stay away from me!

96
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:11,060
- The awesome day of the
Lord's judgment has come.

97
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,429
He is an angry God and he
never lets the guilty

98
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,797
Go unpunished.

99
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:19,235
Save, Jesus!
- Whoa, creepy.

100
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:32,181
- We're out there.

101
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,529
- Look, civilization.

102
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,799
- Good, I hope they
have "hot topics."

103
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:57,473
- I want food.
- I am starving.

104
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:00,310
If we get food poisoning,
it's your fault.

105
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:04,247
- Everything's my fault.

106
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:12,522
This is the heartland,
the salt of the earth.

107
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:15,358
- Peculiar.
- You're a couch potato.

108
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:19,662
- Hey, ladies, try the burgers,
they're killer.

109
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:22,966
- Check him out.
- Cute guy.

110
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:24,767
- Howdy, girls.

111
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,869
You have a seat
wherever you like.

112
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,539
- Smells great.

113
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,276
See?

114
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,945
- So, where you all from?
- Phoenix.

115
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:40,249
- Scottsdale, actually.
- What brings you

116
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,919
Around these parts?

117
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,022
- My sister thinks I need
to get out in the world.

118
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,890
- We're lost.

119
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:51,661
We're looking for the
"world's largest thermometer."

120
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:57,133
- Fifty Miles off at least.
- Tears, I had my heart set.

121
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:01,137
- Something to drink?

122
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,509
- Afternoon, darling.

123
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,878
- Reverend.

124
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,315
Becka.

125
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,228
- Good afternoon, reverend.

126
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,731
- So good to see you.

127
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:41,577
- Oh, don't mind, Becka,
she's, you know...

128
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,789
- Bless us, Lord,
for the bounty

129
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,025
That we are about to receive.

130
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,796
- Normal, huh?

131
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:07,970
- Hey, how about you guys just
grow up a little maybe.

132
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,273
- Okay.

133
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,311
- Whoa, you guys.

134
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:17,046
Check this place out.

135
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,283
It's sweet.

136
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,286
- Man, I don't know but
we're gonna be late

137
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,620
For blacksmiths.

138
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,089
- Oh, hey, we can't
miss the blacksmiths.

139
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,323
- That's right.

140
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:29,358
- What's the worse
that can happen?

141
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,798
- Now we don't have the world's
biggest thermometer

142
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,967
But we do have a doozy.

143
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,909
- Really?
- "Skull City Mine."

144
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:52,019
Becka, be still.

145
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:55,327
- It's just up
the road a stretch.

146
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,696
- What, so it's
like a gold mine?

147
00:13:57,697 --> 00:14:00,465
- It was before it went
bust back in '44.

148
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,635
Now it's a ghost town.

149
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,871
It's haunted...
I seen 'em.

150
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,239
- Haunted?

151
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,674
- We gotta go.

152
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,209
Come on.

153
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,045
- Right.

154
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,713
Let's just boogie
outta here, okay?

155
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:16,014
- It's a once in a
lifetime experience.

156
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:17,950
- Cool...
thank you.

157
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,619
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're going.

158
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,189
- Uh-uh, no, no...
no, no, no.

159
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,833
- You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

160
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,903
- Be still, Becka.

161
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:43,775
- Haven't seen your brothers
at church lately.

162
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:45,777
- They got school city
under control, Abraham.

163
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,479
I swear.

164
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,381
- Yes, they should.

165
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:52,584
We need everybody to
maintain prosperity.

166
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,954
Don't we?

167
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:59,057
- Yes, reverend.

168
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:01,893
- Everyone.

169
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:28,987
- Still can't shake that stare.

170
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:33,692
- You'd be bug eyed too if
you banged the preacher.

171
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:37,696
- How much further?
- Speak of the devil.

172
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,898
- "Skull City Mine."

173
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,701
Great.

174
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:45,170
I don't know why I let you
drag me to these places.

175
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,872
- Because you need a
life, little lady.

176
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,740
- Thanks.

177
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,342
I mean, why do we have to leave
the safety and security

178
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:52,177
Of "atomic comics?"

179
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,913
- Because there's more to
life than reading comics.

180
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:57,482
- Uh, there is?

181
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:03,555
- Check it out.

182
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:06,658
- It's not exactly
"Wally world."

183
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,876
Business is booming.

184
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:28,613
- Yep, come on.

185
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,482
- You know, we still have
time to have a spa day.

186
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:34,619
- Oh, come on, take a
walk on the wild side.

187
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:40,092
- Charming.

188
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:56,093
- Oh.

189
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:59,196
Ain't you two a
sight for swore eyes.

190
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,932
Welcome to
"Skull City Mine."

191
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,935
Two for the tour?
- Yep.

192
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:08,672
- Seven dollars a head...
sign in here.

193
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,344
It's a self guided tour.

194
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:14,845
The whole town is just the
way they left it

195
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:16,380
After it went belly up.

196
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:19,517
School, power station,
bunk houses.

197
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:23,687
Over 30 buildings in all.
- Cool.

198
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:27,658
And, uh, you guys have
ghosts too, right?

199
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:32,463
- This place is
crawling with spirits.

200
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:38,202
Oh, you're the
skittish one, I take it.

201
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,205
Where was I?

202
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:45,943
Oh, we have a real live
working blacksmith shop.

203
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,312
Jonah puts on a
demonstration every hour

204
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:51,282
On the hour.

205
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,818
Shame, you just missed it.

206
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:55,553
- It's on the map.

207
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:58,589
- Well then, you're good to go.

208
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:05,262
If you need anything, I'm mama.

209
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,097
- Thanks, mama.

210
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:11,969
- Oh, and watch out
for them ghosts.

211
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,906
They ain't too friendly.

212
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,876
- Let's go.

213
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,654
"this site was discovered
with Garrison Agburn

214
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:33,724
"dug where he found a
skull and struck gold."

215
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,593
- Special.

216
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:40,631
- "at it's peak 1,000
people lived here."

217
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,739
- What's that?

218
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,207
- The entrance to
the mine shaft.

219
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,943
- You said, "shaft."

220
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:54,778
- "hangman's tree.

221
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,382
"eighteen people were hung
here for stealing gold."

222
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:00,851
- These are the ghosts?

223
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:03,621
- Yeah, Agburn lost his mind

224
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,790
And accused them all of
being demon spawn.

225
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,260
This place is amazing.

226
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:12,796
- I want a latte to go.

227
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,110
Do you see that?

228
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,946
- It's just the wind.

229
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:35,686
- Is that moving?
- I'm telling you, wind, Abby.

230
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,922
- The wind isn't blowing
that hard, Meg.

231
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:41,558
- Okay, that's creepy.

232
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,062
- Yeah, very creepy...
I'm out.

233
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:48,999
- Oh, come on...
this place is awesome.

234
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:56,640
- That was freaky, Meg.

235
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,576
- Oh, you're being
ridiculous, Abby.

236
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:03,213
- I'm gonna wait in the car.

237
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,783
- We just got here...
let's go.

238
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:09,553
- Come on.
- You come on.

239
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,147
Wow, look at this place!

240
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,816
- I assume this is where
they dumped the bodies?

241
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:42,086
- No, that's where
they keep the gold.

242
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:51,862
- Look, it's cute
guy from the diner.

243
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:54,898
- Cute guy?

244
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:58,369
- Wait a minute.

245
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,838
Something's wrong.

246
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,773
- Don't mess with me.

247
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:08,412
- He's bleeding.

248
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:11,448
- Meg, it's not funny.

249
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:15,753
- Sh, don't move.

250
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,089
They're coming.

251
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,566
- Help!

252
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,536
Please!

253
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:19,516
- Jonah Lee, come in.
- Go on, over.

254
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:22,352
- I gotta couple of Phillies
heading your way.

255
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:25,289
- I'm not done with
the first batch.

256
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,239
- He's gone.

257
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:47,911
We gotta go.

258
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:49,279
We can't stay here.

259
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,447
We gotta go.

260
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:51,615
Abby, come on.

261
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:55,185
Abby.

262
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:01,525
Wait.

263
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:04,528
Wait there.

264
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:08,198
He might be alive.

265
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,533
- No, don't-don't-don't.

266
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:11,668
No, Meg.

267
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:14,138
Meg.

268
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:20,777
- Let's go!

269
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:22,679
Abby, come on...
get up!

270
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,582
Come on!

271
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:29,386
- What the hell was that?

272
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,456
Where's mama?
- Sh, don't talk.

273
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:36,093
Go, go.

274
00:23:36,094 --> 00:23:39,029
Come on.

275
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,578
We gotta make a
run for the road.

276
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,746
- We're Miles from anything.

277
00:23:55,747 --> 00:23:58,749
- We gotta make a
run for the road.

278
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,917
- We're next.

279
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,519
We're next.

280
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,524
- Just a matter of time!
- Go, go, now!

281
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:11,662
- Wait up!

282
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,197
- I'm sorry.

283
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:16,733
But this is the
way it's gotta be!

284
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:18,202
- Quiet.

285
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:21,505
- I'm sorry.

286
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:29,413
- Something's you gotta do.

287
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:32,115
Don't mean you
ever like it none.

288
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,088
- Come on.

289
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:21,965
- I ain't in no hurry.

290
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:27,337
Nope, however long it takes,

291
00:25:27,338 --> 00:25:30,574
It takes.

292
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,146
- No, stay away!

293
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:12,182
- We can help...
we're your friends.

294
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:16,853
- My little girl is gone.

295
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:18,322
- What's your name?

296
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,990
- Valerie.

297
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:22,726
- Valerie, I'm Megan...
this is Abby.

298
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:25,729
You need to come with us.
- No, he can't find me here.

299
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,197
- Meg, it's only a
matter of time, okay?

300
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:29,633
- We got separated...
I didn't know what to do.

301
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,401
- Come with us.
- Meg.

302
00:26:31,402 --> 00:26:33,804
- He was taking
pictures, you know.

303
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,673
- I'm not leaving her.

304
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:39,009
- You're with him.

305
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,677
Both of you stay away.

306
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:42,079
- No.

307
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,613
No, we're not here to hurt you.

308
00:26:43,614 --> 00:26:45,849
- Leave me alone.
- Valerie.

309
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,017
- Stay away.
- We want to help.

310
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:49,186
Remember us...
we're from the diner.

311
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:51,855
- I'm getting married soon.
- Valerie, come with us.

312
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,457
- No.
- Come on.

313
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,958
- I picked out my
wedding dress.

314
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,293
- Valerie, come with us!

315
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,962
- I picked out my
wedding dress.

316
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:07,471
- Don't look at me like that!

317
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:11,675
- Abby, move!

318
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:14,010
- I don't take no
pleasure in this.

319
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:17,047
That's the honest truth.

320
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:19,048
- Please.

321
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:28,058
- I answer to a higher power.

322
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,093
- No.

323
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:44,107
- This way...
this way.

324
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,942
- He knows this place.
- They gotta have a car.

325
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:47,811
Come on.

326
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:55,910
- Stay here.

327
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:11,092
Get in.

328
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:14,129
- What do I do?
- Find the keys.

329
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,116
- Keys...
- he's coming.

330
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:38,453
Come on, let's go.

331
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:57,272
- Mama?

332
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:59,874
Mama!

333
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,751
- There's like a million keys.

334
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:20,562
Come on...
come on.

335
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:22,263
- I can't think
with you talking.

336
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:25,033
Damn it.

337
00:29:34,176 --> 00:29:36,044
- He's coming...
he's coming.

338
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:37,212
- We don't have time for this.

339
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:39,881
Come on... come on...
come on.

340
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:43,084
Let's go!

341
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:03,504
Abby.

342
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:21,856
- I'll try to make
this painless.

343
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:47,849
- Come on!

344
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,718
Come on!

345
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,954
You heard me.

346
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:54,022
Come on!

347
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:56,357
Come on!

348
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:23,751
- Well, is he dead?

349
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:25,586
- I'm not checking.

350
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:27,355
- I didn't know you
could do that.

351
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:31,092
- Thanks for helping.

352
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:32,360
- What's that?
- What is it?

353
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:35,496
Flies?

354
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:55,049
- What's that?
- I don't know.

355
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,170
- Stay there.
- No-no-no,

356
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,338
You don't understand...
they killed my brother.

357
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:12,773
Have you seen my sister?

358
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:14,809
- Valerie?
- Yeah.

359
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,545
- She's gone.

360
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:19,847
- What about my...
what about Gordy?

361
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:23,451
- I don't know, man.
- What's happening?

362
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:26,987
- Hell if I know,
but it's over now.

363
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,391
We need his keys.
- They got to our car.

364
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:33,027
- We need his keys.
- I'm not going near him.

365
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:39,733
- Me either.

366
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,179
- I was in charge.

367
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,569
- Someone's coming.

368
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:06,310
I'm gonna talk to
him, okay, guys?

369
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:22,960
- You guys okay?
- We need a ride.

370
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,628
- A ride?

371
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,030
Where's your car?
- Back there.

372
00:33:27,031 --> 00:33:28,866
- Oh, in Skull City Mine?

373
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:32,336
Well, you all need a jump?
- No, uh, you don't understand.

374
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:35,072
- Something weird's going on.
- Abby.

375
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:37,107
- Something weird...
I don't get your drift.

376
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:40,210
- Look, sir...
- you can call me Caleb.

377
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:43,514
My friends call
me Cookie... what's your name?

378
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:46,416
- Megan...
this is Abby.

379
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:50,184
- I'm Pete.

380
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:52,286
- Hey.

381
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:56,557
- Look, look, Caleb, we're a
little wound up right now.

382
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,561
That blacksmith just
tried to kill us.

383
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:02,129
- The blacksmith
tried to kill ya.

384
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,398
- Yeah.

385
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,201
- Well, you're the ones
with blood on ya.

386
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,303
- It's not what it looks like.

387
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:14,441
- Where's the blacksmith now?

388
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:17,578
- Look, can we just get a ride?

389
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,414
- You know, this just
isn't adding up.

390
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:22,249
I mean, I-I gotta make
some sense outta this.

391
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,652
So, I-I think, uh, I'm gonna
go take a look around there

392
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:27,454
And-and then you
get your ride.

393
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:29,356
So why don't you guys
just jump in the back.

394
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:34,328
- No, we're not
going back there.

395
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,764
- Look, back off.

396
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:45,839
Now, you all might be
killers for all I know.

397
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,809
I can't take no chances.

398
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,413
Now get in the
back of the truck.

399
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:55,883
Get in the back!

400
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:59,553
Please.

401
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:08,695
- What are we gonna do?
- Stay cool.

402
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:12,800
- Who is this guy?

403
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:20,641
- Let's take a look around.

404
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:29,283
Don't do anything stupid.

405
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,530
- Guys, what are we gonna do?

406
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:44,998
We gotta get outta here.

407
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,767
- He's gonna find him.

408
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:51,305
- If he does,
we'll explain everything.

409
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:54,108
- Hold up.

410
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:02,416
That way.

411
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:06,220
- We gotta get outta here.

412
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:24,538
- Well, I'll be damned.

413
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:47,928
You all have anything
to do with this?

414
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,696
- No.

415
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:51,966
- That just sounds guilty.

416
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:54,428
You wouldn't believe us if we told you.

417
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,852
- C-can we go now?

418
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:58,921
- I told 'em you can't put

419
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:00,989
In charge of this thing.

420
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,793
Never mind a little God
fearing religious fanatics.

421
00:37:04,794 --> 00:37:09,498
No, you need somebody
who loves the job,

422
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:11,466
Who lives for it.

423
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,436
Craves it.

424
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,743
It was you who killed
him, wasn't it?

425
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,879
I can see it in your eyes.

426
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,916
You got the instinct.

427
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:30,519
- Please.

428
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,288
- He was a weakling,
my little brother.

429
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:36,758
That's what got his ass killed.

430
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:39,561
- Brother?
- Oh, exactumundo.

431
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:40,896
I've been wiping
his ass longer than

432
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:42,264
You been wiping hers.

433
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,366
- Oh, God!

434
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,201
- Oh, no God here,
little missy.

435
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:49,705
This is a godless place
if ever there was one.

436
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:53,075
And Jonah, well he just
didn't have the heart

437
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:55,110
For the job.

438
00:37:55,111 --> 00:38:00,482
But me, I got an
appetite for hurting.

439
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:02,484
Born to it.

440
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:05,354
- Abby, run.
- Not you, boy.

441
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,829
- Don't, sir...
please, don't.

442
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:16,832
- No!

443
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,001
- Oh, I got your attention!

444
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:21,837
Exacto.

445
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:24,706
Well, here's how we're
gonna play this game.

446
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:27,209
I'm gonna start singing
a little ditty

447
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,379
And when I'm done, I'm coming.

448
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,583
So if I was you,
I'd gain some ground.

449
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:37,052
And, hey...

450
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:41,023
No more guns...
no bullets anyway.

451
00:38:41,024 --> 00:38:45,594
I prefer to get up close and
personal with the ladies.

452
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:56,838
And you, I'm gonna
take my time with you.

453
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,063
- You first.

454
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:06,531
I'll lift you.

455
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:08,599
Come on...
oh, come on,

456
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,836
No girly [deleted], let's go.

457
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:14,405
Damn it, Abby.

458
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:17,141
- Baby, please don't go.

459
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:19,377
Baby, please don't go.

460
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:23,848
- What, like I planned it?

461
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:27,885
- Come on!
- I'm trying.

462
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:33,624
- Baby, please don't go
well I need you so.

463
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:39,864
Baby, please don't go.

464
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,502
- Come on.

465
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:01,652
- Ah, the wet stuff.

466
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:10,395
- Meg?

467
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:11,896
Meg?

468
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:14,999
- What?

469
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:19,137
- What the hell is this place?

470
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:21,205
This is a human
gaming preserve?

471
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:23,808
What about the guy's
face, the blacksmith?

472
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:27,345
And-and the ghosts?

473
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:39,390
- Abby-Abby-Abby-Abby-Abby,
it's okay.

474
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,592
It's okay.

475
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:46,597
- You wanna make this
interesting,

476
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:50,935
You gotta do better than this.

477
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:52,036
- Come here.

478
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:53,371
Come here.

479
00:40:53,372 --> 00:40:55,139
Okay, listen none of
that matters, all right?

480
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,874
What matters is getting
outta here alive.

481
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,543
Are we clear?

482
00:40:58,544 --> 00:40:59,844
- All clear.

483
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:00,945
- Okay.

484
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:04,048
Go... go.

485
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:21,265
- You're leakin'.

486
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:25,803
I like that in my women.

487
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:48,559
- Meg!

488
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,662
- Abby, wait up.

489
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,869
Abby!

490
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:23,628
Abby.

491
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:32,270
Abby.

492
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:03,534
- Your hopes and dreams
seem a long way off.

493
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:08,739
But mine are coming true.

494
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:12,370
Sweetie, you home?

495
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,483
Now, you're learnin'...
the trail's gone dead.

496
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:31,722
Quite a trick.

497
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:46,837
Should've givin' her
a running start.

498
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:21,839
Hey, where's the runt?

499
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,378
- What's the matter...
am I too much for ya?

500
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:31,015
- Oh, yeah.

501
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:36,020
I wouldn't go
there if I was you.

502
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:42,426
Come and get it.

503
00:45:50,602 --> 00:45:54,538
Hey!

504
00:45:56,541 --> 00:46:00,010
Real hangover, ain't it?

505
00:46:04,516 --> 00:46:08,219
- Where am I?

506
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:28,239
- If you get far enough away,
your head ain't gooey no more.

507
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,910
- Stay away!

508
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:28,933
- Come on, honey.

509
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,569
You and me had a date with
destiny from the get-go.

510
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,371
- Go to hell,
you son of a bitch.

511
00:47:34,372 --> 00:47:37,041
- This is hell.
- Do it!

512
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:38,676
I won't beg.

513
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:41,345
I won't give you the pleasure.

514
00:47:41,346 --> 00:47:46,350
- Well, I gotta admit
you got some pluck.

515
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:50,354
But you'll beg, all right.

516
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,194
They all beg.

517
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:08,367
- Did you see that guys face
after I kicked him

518
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:09,902
In the balls?

519
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:15,307
- Absolutely classic.

520
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:16,742
- Well, this is it,
the last hoorah

521
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,712
Of Megan and Abby Graves.

522
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:23,449
Meg's going to New York City
to become a marketing drone.

523
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,318
Bitch is abandoning me.

524
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,020
Nothing's gonna
be the same again.

525
00:48:28,021 --> 00:48:30,155
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

526
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:32,358
You're breaking up the team.

527
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,026
What am I gonna do without you?

528
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:38,330
- I don't know...
hopeless.

529
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:42,067
Look, Abby, I know that
I act like I don't care,

530
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:47,206
And all, but I'm really
gonna miss you.

531
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:51,110
And as cool as it is
to go to New York,

532
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:54,246
It really sucks, you know?

533
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:58,317
We have to grow up, right?

534
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:04,590
Wake up, we're heading out.

535
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:06,058
- Where am I?
- Come on,

536
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:07,993
The wilds of Arizona await.

537
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:09,561
You can sleep when you're dead.

538
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:13,665
- Hmm, it's a
comforting thought.

539
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:40,959
- You're a real hell
cat, ain't ya?

540
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,197
- This make you feel
like a big man?

541
00:49:45,198 --> 00:49:49,835
- Hey, this is my private digs.

542
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:53,705
I only bring the
special ones here.

543
00:49:53,706 --> 00:49:55,541
- Why are you doing this?

544
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:58,143
- Why, why, why?

545
00:49:58,144 --> 00:50:01,180
They all ask why.

546
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:02,948
Why does the sun rise?

547
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:07,419
Why does the hawk hunt?

548
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:14,226
I don't know, sugar,
but it sure feels good.

549
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:17,296
- You won't get away with this.

550
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:20,299
- They're gonna look for us.

551
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,835
- Honey, by the time
we're done with you

552
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:25,571
It'll be like you never
even came here.

553
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:28,407
I mean, we take
everything you got.

554
00:50:28,408 --> 00:50:40,152
Car, your identity, hell we
even take your very soul.

555
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:41,787
- You want money?

556
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,123
I have money...
I have a college fund.

557
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,595
- Not interested.

558
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,436
Old reliable.

559
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:38,710
- Please, God.

560
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,855
- No.

561
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,665
The only thing you got that
I want is your suffering.

562
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:38,503
- Megan.

563
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:57,956
Meg!

564
00:52:57,957 --> 00:52:59,558
Meg.

565
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,361
Meg!

566
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:16,408
- Now, we're gonna
have a conversation.

567
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:19,511
And if you answer truthfully,

568
00:53:19,512 --> 00:53:22,948
I'll make it painless.

569
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:30,689
But if you lie,
and I will know if you lie,

570
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,860
I'll make it messy.

571
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:41,466
Do we have an understanding?

572
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:44,903
- You don't have to do this.

573
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:47,072
- Do we have an understanding!

574
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:49,074
- Yes.

575
00:53:49,075 --> 00:53:51,243
Yes.

576
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:53,111
- Good.

577
00:53:53,112 --> 00:53:54,479
Good.

578
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,982
Okay.

579
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:00,719
Okay.

580
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:07,859
How did it feel to kill Jonah?

581
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,096
- What?

582
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:15,600
- You heard me.

583
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:17,335
- I don't know.

584
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:21,640
- Not good enough.

585
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:39,024
- What do you want from me?

586
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:43,762
- I want the truth.

587
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:46,465
- I don't know.

588
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:54,840
What do you want me to say?

589
00:54:54,841 --> 00:55:00,412
- I want you to say
that it felt good.

590
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:13,825
- Meg!

591
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,398
- What you did,
it wasn't right.

592
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:24,136
Now you're gonna get
your come-up ins.

593
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:25,704
Jonah just did his duty.

594
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:29,174
And he's a good man.

595
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:35,480
You naughty little.

596
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:13,739
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

597
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:21,914
How did it feel to
kill my brother?

598
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,482
- I loved it.

599
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:25,017
- Yes!

600
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:28,621
Was that so hard?

601
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:47,239
You and me,
we're birds of a feather.

602
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,674
I mean it.

603
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:50,442
Out of all the rest of 'em,
you're the first one

604
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:53,779
With a taste for the kill.

605
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,124
Better fly in here,
little birdy.

606
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,892
- Abby, no.

607
00:57:06,893 --> 00:57:08,761
Whatever you do,
don't come in here.

608
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,396
- No way...
I'm not leaving you.

609
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:13,833
- Run!

610
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:15,501
- You better get in here

611
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:18,137
Or you're gonna
see your sister's big red smile.

612
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:21,006
- Abby, no...
I'm ordering you to go.

613
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:22,875
- I can't.

614
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:24,243
- Whatever you got
in your hands,

615
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:26,478
You better drop, right now.

616
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:29,515
Drop it!

617
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,722
Mama?

618
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:38,424
- That's right.

619
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:41,760
Let her go or mama's history.

620
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:46,665
- Hey, you killed mama,
you're doing me a big favor.

621
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,467
Now sit your tail
right over there.

622
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:51,303
- Abigail Graves, leave!

623
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:56,041
- He's gonna kill you.
- He's gonna kill me, anyway.

624
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:59,211
- That's far enough...
now sit down.

625
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:03,682
Sit!

626
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:11,824
Now pay attention, runt.

627
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:17,529
I would like you to meet
the new, Mrs. Atwood.

628
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:30,609
Okay, darling, you may
now kiss the groom.

629
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:12,451
You ain't got the stones.

630
00:59:12,452 --> 00:59:15,254
- I don't need 'em.

631
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:36,675
Meg.

632
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:39,912
Meg.

633
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,114
Stay with me, Meg.

634
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:47,720
Come on.

635
00:59:47,721 --> 00:59:49,221
- Hey.

636
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:51,590
Help me.

637
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,092
Okay.

638
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,560
Did you get him?

639
00:59:54,561 --> 01:00:00,265
Good girl.

640
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:02,568
- Okay.

641
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:06,271
- I need you to press this
really tight, okay?

642
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:10,609
Hold it tighter.

643
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,044
Hold it tight.

644
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:13,912
We're gonna go home, okay?

645
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:17,082
- I don't wanna die.

646
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:20,552
- Here's the keys, okay?

647
01:00:28,061 --> 01:00:30,229
You got it?

648
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:33,766
Let's go.

649
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:24,291
Help me!

650
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:25,458
Help!

651
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:26,927
Help!

652
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:29,329
Please!

653
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,597
Help!

654
01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:33,133
My sister, please!

655
01:01:33,134 --> 01:01:35,635
I need your phone!

656
01:01:35,636 --> 01:01:38,705
Are you listening to me!

657
01:01:38,706 --> 01:01:40,907
- Hey, what's the matter?

658
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:43,243
Calm down...
calm down.

659
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:45,545
- My sister.

660
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:47,347
I need a hospital.

661
01:01:47,348 --> 01:01:50,116
- Oh, I'm so sorry...
we don't even have a doctor.

662
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:51,318
- What?

663
01:01:51,319 --> 01:01:52,619
- The closest one
is Sandsworth,

664
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,687
We're talking a good 50 Miles.

665
01:01:53,688 --> 01:01:55,589
- No!

666
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:59,826
- I'm so sorry, sweetie...
I'm really sorry.

667
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:06,700
I'm very, very sorry.

668
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:11,204
- What the [deleted] is
wrong with you people?

669
01:02:12,406 --> 01:02:15,675
- Cursed be he who judge
the Lord's work.

670
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:21,781
Cursed he who holds back
his sword for blood.

671
01:02:38,241 --> 01:02:41,677
- Meg... Meg.

672
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:45,347
- Abby, where are we?

673
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:48,850
- I don't know.

674
01:02:48,851 --> 01:02:50,519
- Look at these people.

675
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,023
- The awesome day of the
Lord's judgment is come.

676
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:59,328
He has prepared his people
for a great slaughter

677
01:02:59,329 --> 01:03:03,131
And has chosen their execution.

678
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:05,233
- Let us go.

679
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:07,936
Please.

680
01:03:07,937 --> 01:03:14,376
- By all that's holy
what have we wrong?

681
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:16,979
How did they get away?

682
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,248
- Let us go, please.

683
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:23,719
- Jonah, Caleb, mama,
they're all dead.

684
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,956
They killed them.

685
01:03:27,957 --> 01:03:32,094
- Darlene, Darlene, Darlene,

686
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:36,298
Your family has failed unity.

687
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:39,801
They were your duty.

688
01:03:39,802 --> 01:03:41,603
- I know.

689
01:03:41,604 --> 01:03:45,774
I understand.

690
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:48,944
- Say Jesus.

691
01:04:01,724 --> 01:04:02,858
- You okay?

692
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,493
- Yeah.

693
01:04:04,494 --> 01:04:07,763
- Where are we?
- I have no idea.

694
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:09,965
What the hell is going on?

695
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:13,502
- They're from the diner.
- Yeah.

696
01:04:13,503 --> 01:04:19,674
- May God be with you.
- And also with you.

697
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,566
- Darlene is in a better place.

698
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:40,767
Amen.

699
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:42,669
- Amen.
- Oh, my God.

700
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:48,642
- This is crazy.

701
01:04:48,643 --> 01:04:52,579
- The Atwood's have
paid for their sins.

702
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,748
- Sins?

703
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:56,783
This doesn't make any sense.

704
01:04:56,784 --> 01:04:59,486
- Abby, keep it together.
- Silence.

705
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:01,355
Have ya turned your
back on the savior?

706
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,823
- No!

707
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:05,392
- Have you taken for granted
the bounty the savior

708
01:05:05,393 --> 01:05:09,029
Has bestowed on you,
that he's bestowed on you?

709
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,230
- No.

710
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:13,600
- Before the savior came
a man was poisoned.

711
01:05:13,601 --> 01:05:16,003
Unity was lost!

712
01:05:16,004 --> 01:05:17,070
Is that what you want?

713
01:05:17,071 --> 01:05:19,306
- No!

714
01:05:19,307 --> 01:05:23,210
- Then we must offer
up their souls.

715
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,145
It is the pack.

716
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:29,716
Otherwise the savior will
take one of our own.

717
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:33,620
- What are you talking about?

718
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:35,989
- Call him!

719
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:40,494

Lord we call to you.

Yours the power and the
glory we call to you.

722
01:05:46,034 --> 01:05:49,570
Yours is the power and
the glory we call to you.

723
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:53,507
Yours is the power and
the glory we call to you.

724
01:05:53,508 --> 01:05:56,076
Yours is the power and
the glory we call to you.

725
01:05:56,077 --> 01:06:00,981

- keep it together.

730
01:06:13,995 --> 01:06:17,331
- Your wretchedness begs
for early release.

731
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:18,765
You're not worthy, child.

732
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,133
You're not long for this earth.

733
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:23,437
You are unworthy.

734
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:28,609
We are unworthy to be in
the presence of the savior.

735
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,978
To do so would provoke
out the demons.

736
01:06:30,979 --> 01:06:32,713
We must offer up their souls
for restitution

737
01:06:32,714 --> 01:06:35,115
For the failures of our people.

738
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,917

- Amen!
- Amen.

743
01:06:45,093 --> 01:06:48,261
- Amen.
- Amen.

744
01:06:48,262 --> 01:06:52,165
For we are unworthy...
for we are unworthy.

745
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:55,535
For we are unworthy...
for we are unworthy.

746
01:06:55,536 --> 01:06:59,506
- Save Jesus.

747
01:06:59,507 --> 01:07:02,509
For we are unworthy...
for we are unworthy.

748
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:06,279
- Save Jesus...

749
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:32,406
- Save Jesus.

750
01:07:32,407 --> 01:07:33,974
- Flies?
- The mine.

751
01:07:33,975 --> 01:07:36,510
There were flies at the mine.

752
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:40,347
- You do not follow this rule.

753
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:45,052
If you do not fear the
name of Lord, our God.

754
01:07:45,053 --> 01:07:46,820
- What is that smell?

755
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:49,223
Oh, God, it's awful.

756
01:07:49,224 --> 01:07:51,058
- The smell makes you crazy.

757
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:55,062
- It will overwhelm you
and your children

758
01:07:55,063 --> 01:08:01,035
For the indescribable plagues.

759
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:04,071
- Don't breath... don't breath...
it makes you crazy!

760
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:48,115
- Hey, hey, calm down.

761
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:03,197
Calm down...
calm down.

762
01:09:05,734 --> 01:09:07,534
The savior got to you.

763
01:09:07,535 --> 01:09:09,536
- Yeah.

764
01:09:09,537 --> 01:09:11,638
Demons the savior?

765
01:09:11,639 --> 01:09:15,542
- Yeah, she's right,
don't get near that smell.

766
01:09:15,543 --> 01:09:17,544
- What are you talking about?

767
01:09:17,545 --> 01:09:19,546
- We have to go...
come on.

768
01:09:19,547 --> 01:09:22,149
- Not without Megan, we don't.

769
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,687
- Cover your mouth.

770
01:09:41,836 --> 01:09:43,103
- Abby?

771
01:09:43,104 --> 01:09:44,338
- Meg.

772
01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:46,473
- The savior is gone.
Gone?

773
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:48,075
- Gone, yeah.

774
01:09:48,076 --> 01:09:49,410
- Can we get outta here?

775
01:09:49,411 --> 01:09:51,678
- It's getting strong,
too strong.

776
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:52,913
Comin' to feed.

777
01:09:52,914 --> 01:09:54,481
I'm telling ya, it'll happen.

778
01:09:54,482 --> 01:10:00,687
- The Lord will strike you
with wasting disease.

779
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:04,525
- And then.
- Fever and inflammation.

780
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:06,260
- How you doing?
- Good.

781
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:09,329
You're from the diner.
- Yeah, I'm Becka.

782
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,365
- What was that thing?

783
01:10:11,366 --> 01:10:13,567
- It's a demon.
- It got in my head.

784
01:10:13,568 --> 01:10:16,303
- Yeah, yeah, you
were possessed.

785
01:10:16,304 --> 01:10:20,641
- He will bring scorching
heat and drought!

786
01:10:20,642 --> 01:10:23,711
Please, please, please Lord

787
01:10:23,712 --> 01:10:27,448
spare us the scorch!

788
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:28,949
- Amen.

789
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,552
- He needs us to kill
so it can feed.

790
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:34,655
Gives off something
a-an odor or smell.

791
01:10:34,656 --> 01:10:36,990
I don't know.

792
01:10:41,563 --> 01:10:43,230
- Where's Becka?

793
01:10:43,231 --> 01:10:45,666
- If you breath it in,
it makes you kill.

794
01:10:45,667 --> 01:10:47,501
- What's it feed on?
- Souls.

795
01:10:47,502 --> 01:10:49,203
- Souls.
- Yeah.

796
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:52,639
The moment of death.

797
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,941
- It feeds on the
victim's souls?

798
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:55,008
- Yeah.

799
01:10:55,009 --> 01:10:57,644
Yeah, you've seen it.

800
01:10:57,645 --> 01:11:00,747
Right?

801
01:11:04,452 --> 01:11:05,853
- They're gone.

802
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:08,856
- So you guys are sacrificing
tourists to that thing?

803
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:11,058
- No, it's them.

804
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:13,660
They think unities luck
will go bad, if they don't.

805
01:11:13,661 --> 01:11:16,129
- How bad can it be?
- You've seen them.

806
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,500
The townspeople,
they're crazed.

807
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:21,401
That thing is no savior.

808
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,570
It's straight from hell.

809
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,472
The community's desperate.

810
01:11:25,473 --> 01:11:27,007
As long as the savior's
in charge...

811
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:29,810
- They'll do anything.
- Huh... yeah.

812
01:11:29,811 --> 01:11:33,013
Yeah, anything.

813
01:11:33,014 --> 01:11:35,282
- Abby.
- What, what?

814
01:11:35,283 --> 01:11:38,685
- Don't wait...
I'm holding you down.

815
01:11:38,686 --> 01:11:41,788
- No, you're not...
just keep going.

816
01:11:41,789 --> 01:11:43,624
- I need a minute.
- No, we have to go.

817
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:45,192
Let's go...
it's getting stronger.

818
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:47,327
We can't let it feed, come on!

819
01:11:47,328 --> 01:11:49,096
- Just give us a minute.
- Come on!

820
01:11:56,070 --> 01:12:01,008
- Becka, she lost her way.
- You're insane.

821
01:12:01,009 --> 01:12:05,579
- No, we are God's will.

822
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:14,721
- Wait a minute...
she's still alive.

823
01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:17,724
Let's go.

824
01:12:17,725 --> 01:12:21,628
- Abby.

825
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:30,537
- Run.

826
01:12:31,906 --> 01:12:35,709
R-r-run!

827
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:39,313
- Come on.

828
01:13:16,584 --> 01:13:20,854
- Luke, Luke, answer me.

829
01:13:26,761 --> 01:13:28,528
You hear me?

830
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,631
Luke... Luke.

831
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:35,202
They are coming.

832
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:38,872
We are coming.

833
01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:54,721
- Where are we?

834
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,924
We're just going
around in circles.

835
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:02,095
- You hear that?

836
01:14:02,096 --> 01:14:03,630
- It's gone.

837
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:07,334
It's gone.

838
01:14:07,335 --> 01:14:12,739
- I'm so sorry I made
us come here.

839
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,709
I'm so sorry.

840
01:14:20,548 --> 01:14:21,748
I'm sorry.

841
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,083
- None of that matters, okay?

842
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,918
What matters is getting
out of here alive, okay?

843
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:27,254
Remember?
- Yeah.

844
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:29,589
I'm so sorry, okay?

845
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,292
Why isn't he just
waiting out there?

846
01:14:32,293 --> 01:14:36,530
- I think he needs us...
he can't kill on its own.

847
01:14:36,531 --> 01:14:40,834
- You sure?

848
01:14:40,835 --> 01:14:44,504
- No, I'm not sure
about anything.

849
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:50,143
Meg, look.

850
01:14:50,144 --> 01:14:54,614
- Oh, no, not here...
not again.

851
01:15:04,892 --> 01:15:07,394
Think we can make it?

852
01:15:07,395 --> 01:15:10,097
- We've got to chance it.

853
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,557
- Hold on...
hold on, Meg.

854
01:15:22,558 --> 01:15:25,927
- Do not deny the savior!

855
01:15:29,432 --> 01:15:32,667
- It's them...
it's all of them.

856
01:15:32,668 --> 01:15:35,303
- Train wreck.

857
01:15:37,206 --> 01:15:39,007
Back off.

858
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:41,676
You hear me...
stay the hell away.

859
01:15:41,677 --> 01:15:44,212
- They're everywhere.

860
01:15:45,748 --> 01:15:47,048
- Get away from us.

861
01:15:47,049 --> 01:15:50,852
- Weep and moan you
evil Sheppard's.

862
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:53,755
Roll in the dust you
leaders of the flock.

863
01:15:53,756 --> 01:15:55,891
- Back off!

864
01:15:55,892 --> 01:15:59,594
- The time of your
spawn has arrived!

865
01:15:59,595 --> 01:16:02,631
- The savior.

866
01:16:07,203 --> 01:16:09,771
- They're turning...
we gotta get outta here.

867
01:17:15,037 --> 01:17:18,240
- I think they're dead.
- Good... let's get outta here.

868
01:17:18,241 --> 01:17:20,141
- Okay.
- Come on.

869
01:17:20,142 --> 01:17:23,678
Before you know it that thing.

870
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:55,143
- What was that...
where is it?

871
01:17:55,144 --> 01:17:57,178
- I don't know.

872
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:59,614
I don't know.

873
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,525
- Demon!

874
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:14,896
I will stuff you out.

875
01:18:14,897 --> 01:18:17,232
You did this.

876
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:18,767
- We're not running anymore.

877
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:21,569
- The savior is gone.
- We can do this.

878
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,172
- Unity is lost.

879
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:29,678
I will cover the mountains
with your flesh.

880
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,715
Fill the valleys
with your carcass.

881
01:18:33,716 --> 01:18:37,986
We will bring vengeance
on his enemies.

882
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:41,189
You have no place to escape.

883
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:43,491
- Abby!

884
01:18:48,631 --> 01:18:52,300
- Oh, God...
oh, Lord.

885
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:55,537
Do I not love thee?

886
01:18:55,538 --> 01:18:59,674
Do I not hate
those who hate you?

887
01:18:59,675 --> 01:19:03,411
Oh, Lord.

888
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:19,094
- It's over.

889
01:19:19,095 --> 01:19:20,328
- Yeah.

890
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:21,830
You okay.

891
01:19:21,831 --> 01:19:23,465
- Yeah.

892
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:25,233
You?

893
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:28,770
- Never better.

894
01:19:30,172 --> 01:19:31,706
- Where's the savior.

895
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:35,477
- He's dead, right?
- I hope so.

896
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:58,700
I'm proud of you.

897
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:01,669
- Ah, don't get all
mushy on me, it's gross.

898
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,405
- I mean it.

899
01:20:03,406 --> 01:20:06,107
You're gonna be fine.

900
01:20:06,108 --> 01:20:07,409
- I'm coming to new
York with you.

901
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:09,010
- You are?

902
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:10,245
- Yeah.

903
01:20:10,246 --> 01:20:15,483
Someone needs to
take care of you.

904
01:20:15,484 --> 01:20:17,318
- Can we get outta here?

905
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:20,622
- I thought you'd never ask.

906
01:20:24,593 --> 01:20:25,827
- Please, turn that off.

907
01:20:25,828 --> 01:20:27,529
You said, when
I could kick your ass.

908
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,998
- Okay.

909
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,003
No one's gonna believe us.

910
01:20:35,004 --> 01:20:38,373
- Yeah, who would have thought,
Megan and Abby Graves,

911
01:20:38,374 --> 01:20:40,675
"monster hunters."

912
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:21,349
- We have risen.

913
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:24,819
For we have made it.

914
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:30,091
Save Jesus.

915
01:21:30,092 --> 01:21:35,864
Save Jesus.

916
01:21:35,865 --> 01:21:38,399
Save Jesus.
