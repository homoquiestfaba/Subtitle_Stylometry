1
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,159
My name is A lit he a.

2
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,813
My story is true.

3
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:26,207
You're more likely
to believe me, however,

4
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:28,451
if I tell it as a fairy tale.

5
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:33,736
So, once upon a time,

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,547
when humans hurtled
across the sky on metal wings,

7
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,786
when they wore webbed feet

8
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,160
and walked
on the bottom of the sea,

9
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:45,574
when they held
in their hands glass tiles

10
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:48,142
that could coax
love songs from the air...

11
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:52,910
...there was a woman,
adequately happy and alone.

12
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,671
Alone by choice.

13
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:58,587
Happy because
she was independent,

14
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,701
living off the exercise
of her scholarly mind.

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,444
Her business was story.

16
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,423
She was a narratologist

17
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:10,208
who sought to find the truths

18
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:13,191
common to all the stories
of humankind.

19
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:17,258
To this end,
once or twice a year,

20
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:19,869
she ventured to strange lands.

21
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,611
To China, the South Seas,

22
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:24,855
and the timeless cities
of the Levant...

23
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:33,429
where her kind gathered
to tell stories about stories.

24
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,148
This way.

25
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,193
- Excuse me.
- This way, lady.

26
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:40,847
What are you doing?
Can you let go, please?

27
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,284
The mysteries of Istanbul.

28
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,356
A lit he a!

29
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:48,966
A lit he a!

30
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,514
Welcome!

31
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,211
- Welcome at last! Aw.
- Gunhan!

32
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:59,344
My dear friend.

33
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,823
- Oh, how wonderful!
- I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,521
- This is Amina.
- Amina.

35
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,329
From the British Council.

36
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,483
That fellow at the airport
manhandling my luggage,

37
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:09,702
did you see him?

38
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,944
What fellow?

39
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:14,731
He scuttled off
when you arrived.

40
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:19,953
Small, sheepskin jacket,
pink collar.

41
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:23,696
Interesting.

42
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,917
He was hot to touch.

43
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,311
Musky.

44
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,506
Perhaps he was a djinn.

45
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,987
An illegal taxi driver,
more likely.

46
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:35,945
Wearing too much cologne.

47
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,817
So, Professor,

48
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,341
you saying you believe in djinn?

49
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:43,257
I believe there are those
who need to believe in them.

50
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,389
Including me?

51
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:45,805
Djinn, ghosts,

52
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,591
aliens, whatever helps.

53
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,774
The hotel's arranged
a lovely surprise for you.

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,887
It's the Agatha Christie room.

55
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,193
In this room,

56
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:08,828
she wrote
Murder on the Orient Express.

57
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,600
So, how would you explain

58
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,993
the power of a thunderstorm

59
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,386
if you don't have the means

60
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,891
to measure and model
meteorological data?

61
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,784
How can you explain the seasons?

62
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:34,569
Autumn through winter
to spring and summer,

63
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,745
if you don't know that the Earth

64
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,424
orbits the Sun
while tilted on an axis?

65
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,664
Everything was mystery.

66
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:47,756
The seasons, tsunamis,
microbial disease...

67
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,847
What else could we do
but resort to stories?

68
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,894
As Dr. Binnie has
encouraged us to understand,

69
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,983
stories were once the only way

70
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,551
to make our bewildering
existence coherent.

71
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,335
That's exactly right.

72
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:04,033
We gave name
to the unknown forces

73
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:07,080
behind all wonder
and catastrophe,

74
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,498
by telling each other...

75
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,915
By telling each other stories.

76
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,699
Let me show you.

77
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:22,443
We told tales of specific,
powerful, relatable gods

78
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,838
ever present in all cultures,
in all mythologies,

79
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:28,884
from the Greeks,
to the Romans, to the Norse,

80
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,756
and so on, and so on.

81
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,107
The familiar descendant
of Zeus, Poseidon, Athena,

82
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,675
Thor, the whole gang,

83
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,330
find expression even today.

84
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,662
These are their vestiges.

85
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:48,841
The question remains,
what is their purpose?

86
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,371
What do we require of them now?

87
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:01,700
There is mythos,
and there is science.

88
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,139
Oh. Sorry.

89
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:10,622
Mythology is what
we knew back then.

90
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:13,755
Science is what we know so far.

91
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:20,762
Sooner or later,

92
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:23,591
our creation stories
are replaced

93
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,530
by the narratives of science.

94
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,901
Painstaking science.

95
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,927
And all gods and monsters

96
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:34,104
outlive their original purpose

97
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,562
and are reduced to metaphor.

98
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:39,762
Rubbish!

99
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,090
A lit he a!

100
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:49,511
A lit he a.

101
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:51,706
What happened?

102
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,142
I don't know.
She just fell.

103
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,057
She just fell.

104
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,127
Gosh.

105
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:05,483
Are you okay?

106
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,515
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

107
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:19,038
Why?
When I feel so well?

108
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,475
Forgive me, A lit he a.
Are you sure?

109
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,738
Apart from
the usual aches and pains,

110
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:25,436
there is nothing untoward.

111
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,133
There's no reason
to make a fuss.

112
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,028
So, what happened back there?

113
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,993
Lately, my imagination's
been getting the better of me.

114
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,711
Ambushing me.

115
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:40,886
I think it's a warning.

116
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,172
About what?

117
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,586
Not to be complacent.

118
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,936
To keep on my toes.

119
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,591
It manifests rudely
from time to time.

120
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,159
I try not to fight it off.

121
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:56,989
It takes charge for a moment,
and then it steps back.

122
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,556
What steps back?

123
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,670
Oh, Gunhan, it's
irrational. Pay it no mind.

124
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:06,520
You are behaving like
a child. Do you know that?

125
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:07,956
You know, I am actually a child.

126
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,205
If there is fate,
can we escape it?

127
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,207
Who can say?

128
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,012
But I tell you this,

129
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,231
in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul,

130
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:27,149
there are 62 streets
and 4,000 shops.

131
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,307
And in one of those shops,
there are three rooms.

132
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,199
In the smallest of those rooms,

133
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,810
there was a pile
of things unsorted,

134
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,532
old and new.

135
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:40,535
From the bottom of that pile,

136
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,146
I chose a memento.

137
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,825
Do you know what this is?

138
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,698
I'm not sure,
but it could be Cesm-i Bulbul,

139
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,221
a "Nightingale's Eye."

140
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,572
Around 1845, there were
these glassmakers in Incirkoy.

141
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:01,183
They were famous for this
spiral blue-white pattern.

142
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,229
Oh, please.
It's a gift from me.

143
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:05,124
Choose something less forlorn.

144
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:12,325
And, uh, if this
is Cesm-i Bulbul,

145
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:14,849
uh, is there a way
of authenticating it?

146
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:16,590
Well, they say
that if it is genuine,

147
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:18,592
sometimes you can see
specks of blood

148
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:20,028
from the lungs
of the glassblowers.

149
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:23,249
But this is more likely
a recent imitation.

150
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:26,015
It's been damaged by fire.
Pick something else.

151
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,321
No, thank you, Gunhan.

152
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,691
I like it.

153
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:33,588
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it has an interesting story.

154
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,156
Hello?

155
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,375
Good morning, Dr. Binnie.

156
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,898
- Good morning.
- This is room service.

157
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:05,117
- Yes.
- How do you like your eggs?

158
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,684
Er, runny, please.

159
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,077
- And with toast?
- Yes, but no crusts.

160
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,253
- Two eggs?
- Just one.

161
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,018
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

162
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:46,958
I'm going to close my eyes
and count to three,

163
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,307
after which I would be grateful

164
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,811
if you would be gone.

165
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,748
One,

166
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,034
two,

167
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,143
three.

168
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,453
Four,

169
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:05,827
five,

170
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,327
six,

171
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,372
seven, eight,

172
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,007
nine, ten.

173
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,397
I don't suppose
you speak English?

174
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,250
Deutsch?

175
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,557
Espanol?

176
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,448
Ellinika?

177
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:13,974
Einstein.

178
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:15,217
Einstein.

179
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,333
Television.

180
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,864
Transmitters.

181
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,310
I am a djinn of modest power,

182
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:49,923
but I begin to understand
these transmissions.

183
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,272
Oh!

184
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,622
You've learned
to speak my language.

185
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:56,625
This English is straightforward.

186
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,150
Its rules quickly learn, I find.

187
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:05,591
Nein, nein, nein.

188
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:06,984
Would you like this
little Albert for yourself?

189
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,333
No, no, no.

190
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,900
That can't be good for him.
Put him back.

191
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,162
- I could expand him.
- How?

192
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:12,380
We could speak with him.

193
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:13,904
- How is this possible?
- No, put him back.

194
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,644
- Is that your wish?
- This is not possible.

195
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,583
No. It's your obligation.

196
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:25,306
So, what will you wish for?

197
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,986
What is your heart's desire?

198
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:39,016
Now, let's, uh,
not get ahead of ourselves.

199
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,019
I need to take this slow.

200
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:45,370
I have all the time
in the world.

201
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:47,459
Tell me about yourself.

202
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,461
My name is A lit he a Binnie.

203
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,985
I am in Turkey for a conference.

204
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,422
And I return to my homeland
in a day's time.

205
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,597
Also?

206
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:02,256
Also, I have
a confession to make.

207
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,302
Something
I've never told anybody.

208
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:05,631
Excellent.

209
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,742
When I was young,
there was a boy.

210
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,265
Your first lover?

211
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:14,181
No, no, no.
He was not of flesh and blood.

212
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,443
A djinn?

213
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,576
No.

214
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,449
At that time, I found myself
in a school for girls.

215
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,364
Gaggles of girls.

216
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:28,195
I was... Well, I am
a solitary creature by nature.

217
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:31,242
And this boy, Enzo,

218
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:34,182
he came to me,
out of an emptiness.

219
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,379
Out of a need to imagine.

220
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,294
He told me stories in a language

221
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:42,581
that only we two spoke.

222
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,257
And he always disappeared
when I had a headache,

223
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:47,519
but he was never far away

224
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:50,000
when I couldn't move for asthma.

225
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,697
He was like this little Albert

226
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,307
you would not let me give you?

227
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,222
An emanation?

228
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:58,138
Only an emanation of an absence.

229
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:04,473
I feared he would leave,
and so I wrote him down.

230
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:11,132
And I filled this journal,
bulging with facts.

231
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:16,678
But the more realism
I tried to insert,

232
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,681
the more I began to doubt,

233
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,795
and, uh, it all began
to feel silly.

234
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,711
I felt silly.

235
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,170
So, after a time,

236
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,544
I burned it all
in the school furnace.

237
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,549
And after that,
he disappeared altogether.

238
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,423
And yet, I am here.

239
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,688
Contrary to reason, yes.

240
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:51,061
I am here,
and we have work to do.

241
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,717
Can you come back later, please?

242
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,676
It's room service,
Dr. Binnie.

243
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,721
I have your breakfast.

244
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,312
Just a minute!

245
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,098
Must close door.

246
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,437
Good morning.

247
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:20,655
Where would you like it,
Dr. Binnie?

248
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:21,917
Thank you. Oh, I can take it.

249
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:24,224
- Please, allow me.
- No. No, I can manage it.

250
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,835
Jolly good, Dr. Binnie.
I hope you are well rested.

251
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,576
Oh, that looks delicious.
Yes, I am.

252
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,404
What do you plan to do
on this fine day?

253
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:33,146
Uh, I'm not sure.
I'm improvising.

254
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,627
Well, I'd like to show you
a beautiful art gallery...

255
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:36,845
That's so kind. Thank you.

256
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,020
...this afternoon,
when you get a chance.

257
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,370
- Maybe another time.
- It will be great.

258
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:40,414
Thank you.
Have a beautiful day.

259
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,590
Okay. Jolly good. Enjoy.

260
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,833
Thank you!

261
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,807
A more convenient size, I see.

262
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,746
I do what I can to fit in.

263
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:30,160
Please.

264
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,336
I needn't have
ordered breakfast.

265
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,817
It's nan-e nokhodchi.
Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

266
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,626
It will melt in your mouth.

267
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:44,739
May I ask you something?

268
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:45,895
Anything.

269
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:50,204
How come you found your way
into my bottle?

270
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:52,815
Ah, it's quite a story.

271
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:55,794
That was my third incarceration.

272
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,883
You've been trapped
in a bottle three times?

273
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:00,233
I may be a djinn,
but I'm also a fool

274
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,844
with too great a fondness
for the conversation of women.

275
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,238
I need to be more careful
in the future.

276
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:06,782
How were you caught
in the first place?

277
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,199
By desire.

278
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,876
How else?

279
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:15,335
Who was she?

280
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,815
Sheba.

281
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,208
The Queen of Sheba?

282
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:19,731
She was my kin.

283
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:20,862
She was a djinn?

284
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,386
Her mother was a djinn.

285
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,474
Is that possible?

286
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:24,692
There are laws that allow

287
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:26,216
the union of djinn and mortals,

288
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,956
but they cannot produce
an immortal scion

289
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,262
the way a donkey and a horse

290
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,245
can only produce
a seedless mule.

291
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,008
So, what did she look like?

292
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:40,230
Other than a thick glade
of black hair on her legs,

293
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,622
she looked like
any other human being,

294
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:43,929
except, of course,
she was Sheba.

295
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:46,540
By all accounts,
she was very beautiful.

296
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:49,524
She was not beautiful.
She was beauty itself.

297
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,854
I was in every way free.

298
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:58,881
I would come in and out
of her sleeping chamber.

299
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,537
Sheba...

300
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:08,910
I knew as well as any
of her female slaves

301
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,937
the touches that made
her shiver with bliss.

302
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,593
Never have I wanted
a creature so.

303
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,876
And she desired you in return?

304
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,271
I was her plaything.
Her confidante.

305
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:23,534
I might have become more,
but for Solomon.

306
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:24,752
King Solomon?

307
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,754
Blessed be his memory.

308
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:29,017
He came from across
the deserts to woo her.

309
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,323
Didn't she go to him?

310
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:31,672
No. Never.

311
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,500
But it's in all the holy books.

312
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:34,980
All the stories
and the paintings.

313
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:36,764
And Handel wrote music about it.

314
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:38,375
Madam, I was there.

315
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,072
Solomon came to her.

316
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:09,430
He began with music.

317
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,457
I did all that I could
to dissuade her.

318
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:45,589
But when she used

319
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,460
the scented wax
of the Jabassa Bee

320
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:49,027
to remove the hair
from her legs,

321
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:50,724
I knew that I was lost.

322
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:53,074
But I, like a fool,
went on telling her

323
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,077
that her body
was rich and lovely,

324
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,732
but her mind
was richer and lovelier,

325
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:00,517
and more durable.

326
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,606
And she agreed
with all that I said,

327
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,240
and dropped a hot tear.

328
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:08,612
She began to set him tasks,
which seemed impossible,

329
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:10,744
to find a particular thread
of red silk

330
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,746
in the palace
of a thousand rooms,

331
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,619
to guess the secret name
of her mother djinn,

332
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:18,926
to tell her
what women most desire.

333
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,798
That does seem impossible.

334
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:22,060
Not for him.

335
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,583
He could speak
to the beasts of the earth,

336
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:26,020
and to the djinn
made of subtle fire.

337
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:29,110
He found ants to discover
the thread of silk,

338
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,199
and an ifrit to whisper
the mother's name.

339
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,032
Then he looked into her eyes

340
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:41,122
and told her
what women most desire.

341
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:44,846
She was astonished,

342
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:48,023
and told him he was right.

343
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,050
And so she granted him
what he most desired,

344
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,947
which was to wed her
and be taken to her bed.

345
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,814
He was a great magician...

346
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,294
...and imprisoned me

347
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:25,539
with a word of power
into a brass bottle.

348
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:53,828
She made no plea for me.

349
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,198
I was nothing to her.

350
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,137
A breath in a bottle.

351
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:16,653
And so, I was cast
into the Red Sea

352
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:20,289
and languished for 2,500 years.

353
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:27,228
Apart from sleep,

354
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,212
what does one do in a bottle
for 2,500 years?

355
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:33,258
Djinn don't sleep.

356
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,614
So, how do you manage then?

357
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:48,641
Well, for the first 100 years,
I rage against my fate.

358
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:50,382
I pray to Boschkolo
for my release,

359
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:51,818
and when that does not work,

360
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,298
I pray to any god I know,

361
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,256
and then to any god
I may not know.

362
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,955
And when, still,
I find no answers,

363
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,132
I spend my time in waking dreams

364
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:03,917
revisiting all the stories
of my life.

365
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:06,877
And when I have exhausted this
many, many times,

366
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:09,923
I return to my prayer
and my rage.

367
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:12,907
And then, finally,

368
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:16,388
I play a trick on myself.

369
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:19,280
I pray to remain in the bottle.

370
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,110
I beseech Boschkolo to keep me
always in the bottle.

371
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:24,677
And does that work?

372
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,157
To yearn for nothing?

373
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,028
To pretend to want nothing more

374
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:29,769
than to be contained
in a bottle?

375
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,249
No.

376
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,015
For a djinn, it is the closest
we ever come to death.

377
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,648
Do you know the answer
to her question?

378
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:39,823
What women most desire?

379
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:40,954
Yeah.

380
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:42,695
Do you not know?

381
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:44,218
If you do not know,
I cannot tell you.

382
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,394
Well, surely, we don't
all want the same thing.

383
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:50,007
Madam, your yearnings
are not at all clear to me.

384
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:53,314
I... I'm at a point in my life
where I have all I need.

385
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,882
I daresay I'm content,
and gratefully so.

386
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:57,014
Tell me.

387
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,407
Are you a wife? A widow?

388
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,671
- Um...
- A mother, perhaps?

389
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:04,219
I have no children,
no siblings, no parents.

390
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:07,285
I did once have a husband.

391
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:08,547
Ah.

392
00:28:08,571 --> 00:28:10,704
And what was the complexion
of this husband?

393
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:12,682
His complexion?

394
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:15,859
In the beginning,
it was glowing.

395
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,687
And in the ending?

396
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,210
It's not much of a story.

397
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:22,126
But it is a story.
It is your story,

398
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,780
and it is always wise

399
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,738
to understand those
who have a hold on you.

400
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:26,826
Please.

401
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:31,246
Well, okay, um...

402
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,183
We'd known each other
since our youth.

403
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,055
We, uh, married early.

404
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,013
In the beginning,
we took pleasure

405
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:41,841
in each other's minds
and bodies.

406
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:43,190
Um...

407
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:45,018
We passed the years comfortably,

408
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,436
and then as it happens,

409
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,197
it all evaporated,

410
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,267
and, uh... and we became

411
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,419
less.

412
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:55,443
And where is he?

413
00:28:57,141 --> 00:29:00,077
He's in Hackney,
with Emmeline Porter.

414
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:01,276
Mmm.

415
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,390
He told me I...

416
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,871
I was incapable
of reading feelings.

417
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,356
I was incapable
of reading his feelings.

418
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,271
...gonna have
a resolution.

419
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:21,446
This is exciting!

420
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,013
- It is exciting!
- No, it's not.

421
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,449
Let me guess.
No one dies in it.

422
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,190
No!

423
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:30,020
The way my brain
is wired is... is the...

424
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:33,023
the source both of my power

425
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,789
and, uh, and my solitude.

426
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,966
I suspect that's why
I like stories.

427
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,510
I find feelings through stories.

428
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:49,039
Perhaps you could
wish for him back.

429
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:51,195
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

430
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,457
No.

431
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:56,200
I... I thought, um,

432
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:01,118
I might grieve
a loss and betrayal, but, uh,

433
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:04,121
no, in fact, I was free.

434
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,840
I was like a prisoner

435
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:11,452
emerging from a dungeon
into the sunlight.

436
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,281
I expanded into the space
of my own life.

437
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:18,459
No, I could not wish for more.

438
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,462
You are a wise
and cautious woman, A lit he a.

439
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,117
But we all have desires,

440
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,013
even if they remain
hidden from us.

441
00:30:28,145 --> 00:30:29,949
That's as maybe.

442
00:30:29,973 --> 00:30:34,867
But I am also a narratologist,

443
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:37,348
and that is going
to be a problem.

444
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:39,611
It's going to be
a very big problem.

445
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,831
See, I know
all the stories there are

446
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:43,180
about trickster djinn,

447
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:44,485
and the ways in which
they manipulate wishing

448
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,573
to their own ends.

449
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:46,879
I am not one of them.

450
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:48,838
I am god-fearing and honorable,

451
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:51,101
and only here
to grant your heart's desire.

452
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,190
Well, even if that's true,

453
00:30:53,214 --> 00:30:56,391
how can you rely on those
called upon to wish?

454
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:01,222
How do you know
you can rely on me?

455
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,375
Well, I hope so.

456
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,204
With you, I certainly hope so.

457
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:09,423
There's a...

458
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:12,339
funny little story.
I mean, you probably know it.

459
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:14,298
Three friends lost at sea
in a tiny boat.

460
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,039
They pull up a magic fish,

461
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:17,605
who grants each of them
one wish.

462
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:18,737
The first one,

463
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:20,521
"I wish I were at home
with my wife."

464
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,696
He vanishes.

465
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,307
The second one,
"I wish I were playing"

466
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:24,612
"in the fields
with my children."

467
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:25,831
Off he goes.

468
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:28,355
And the third one,
"I miss my friends..."

469
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:29,400
"I wish they were here."

470
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,054
You've got it.

471
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:34,318
There's no story about wishing
that is not a cautionary tale.

472
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,233
None end happily.

473
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,148
Not even the ones
that are supposed to be jokes.

474
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,454
But you and I
are the authors of this story,

475
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:43,003
and we can avoid all traps.

476
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,094
Well, what if
I made no wish at all?

477
00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:50,097
Pardon?

478
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,599
What if I made no wish?

479
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:55,992
That would be an...

480
00:31:58,322 --> 00:31:59,560
That would be

481
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,998
catastrophic!

482
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,578
All right.

483
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,238
I need to tell you
about my next incarceration.

484
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:26,350
I'm all ears.

485
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:39,165
I will never know

486
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:43,082
how my bottle came from the
bottom of the Red Sea...

487
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:46,501
...to a palace
in Constantinople.

488
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,567
But I fancy somehow it involved

489
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,177
the killing of
an Ottoman warrior.

490
00:32:57,164 --> 00:32:58,687
The fall of an empire.

491
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:09,326
And a girl in love.

492
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,373
Merhaba.

493
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,634
Gulten lived as a slave

494
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:58,505
in the courtyard
of the concubines

495
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:00,029
in the seraglio.

496
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:20,353
When I appeared to her...

497
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:25,358
...she fainted.

498
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:28,100
And I had great trouble
rousing her.

499
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:36,717
I made it clear
that I meant her no harm,

500
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,545
for I was condemned
to the bottle.

501
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:40,112
Until you got your three wishes.

502
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,114
Until she got hers.

503
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:44,247
- Please.
- Okay.

504
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:45,726
Now, the poor girl told me

505
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,687
she was distractedly in love
with a beautiful man...

506
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,646
...and she wished immediately

507
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,084
to find favor in his eyes.

508
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,663
As it happens,

509
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:11,839
the one she most desired
was the splendid Mustafa.

510
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:13,648
Prince Mustafa.

511
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:18,281
Eldest son of
Suleiman the Magnificent,

512
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:21,351
and likely heir
to his mighty throne.

513
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,851
Had I known what was to come,

514
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,159
I would've risked
the furies of Iblis

515
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:30,317
to vehemently distract her
from her wish.

516
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:33,383
But without thinking,

517
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,168
I took my bottle
and conjured oils

518
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:37,628
to prepare her.

519
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,912
Oils of enchantment

520
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:44,157
once used only by Sheba.

521
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,878
I cautioned her
to hide the bottle

522
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:53,775
lest its powers
fall into other hands.

523
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:00,627
I went to Mustafa.

524
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:02,542
Gulten.

525
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:03,872
I whispered her name.

526
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:10,270
He sent for her.

527
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:14,491
It was so easy.

528
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,435
As a djinn,
I am endlessly curious

529
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,243
about the ways of humans.

530
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:29,917
So, in my spare time,

531
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:33,423
I took to wandering the palace
in search of its intrigues.

532
00:36:34,337 --> 00:36:35,836
And there, among the eunuchs,

533
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,577
the consorts,
and the concubines,

534
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,734
I first saw Hurrem.

535
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:42,234
The Laughing One.

536
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,766
She, too, was a slave

537
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,508
who had risen
through the center of them all

538
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,795
to become the Sultan's favorite.

539
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:10,001
Suleiman the Wise
saw none but her.

540
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:12,699
And she sought
to protect his throne

541
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:16,858
in favor of her own sons
over his beloved Mustafa.

542
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,926
And to this end,
she had the prince watched

543
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,734
by many probing eyes.

544
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,374
When I saw how Hurrem

545
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:39,378
made a masterpiece
of her manipulations,

546
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:43,276
I worried that my Gulten
might be caught in this web.

547
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:51,390
I tried to warn her
to be careful.

548
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:56,700
But she had already
decided on her second wish.

549
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:11,565
Such a mistake.

550
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:14,674
Because at this moment,

551
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,937
Suleiman, blessed be his name,

552
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,702
is being undermined.

553
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,595
His warriors believe
he is going soft,

554
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,337
more interested in his poetry

555
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,774
than ruling with a strong hand.

556
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:45,052
Hurrem fuels the rumors

557
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:47,054
that the military
want to take his throne

558
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:49,516
and replace him with Mustafa.

559
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,408
The prince has become a pawn

560
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:55,411
in the ceaseless game of power.

561
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:09,729
Suleiman the Magnificent,

562
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:11,470
Suleiman the Conqueror,

563
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:14,343
patron and protector of empires,

564
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:15,866
Suleiman the Father,

565
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,389
was left with a choice

566
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:20,460
that he knows
will break his heart.

567
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,446
Gulten, meantime, saw no reason

568
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,883
why she should remain unseen.

569
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:40,567
Given she was carrying the son
of the next Sultan.

570
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:48,681
Despite all my warnings,

571
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:52,729
she parades her newly swollen
breasts and belly.

572
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:56,428
And the whispers soon spread
throughout the seraglio.

573
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:05,940
The terrible plottings
move all too quickly.

574
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:34,466
Prince Mustafa comes innocently

575
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,686
into the presence of his father,

576
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,471
to reassure him of his loyalty.

577
00:40:50,463 --> 00:40:52,703
And
the mutes are waiting for him.

578
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:58,621
He cried out to his Janissaries,

579
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:00,231
who loved him,

580
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:02,973
but his voice was crushed
and his breath stopped

581
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,695
by the string
of his father's bow.

582
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,891
Gulten!

583
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,554
"Make a wish!"

584
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:04,754
"Save yourself, Gulten!"

585
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,868
Just a few words
and she could have been free

586
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:15,567
to bear her child in safety,

587
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:19,136
and I to spirit away at last
to the Realm of Djinn.

588
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,530
But she ran into the hands
of the assassins.

589
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:25,577
I was about
to take them by force,

590
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,971
when I was blocked
by a follower of Iblis.

591
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,342
Gulten!

592
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:30,623
She made
no wish to save herself.

593
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:34,801
No wish was made
to save us both.

594
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:44,177
So, there I was,

595
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:46,266
or there I was not,
might you say,

596
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,356
almost emancipated
and tethered to this world

597
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,924
by a third wish unperformed.

598
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:53,578
But you realize, don't you,

599
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:56,407
that you've just told me the
story of a woman who was doomed

600
00:43:56,431 --> 00:43:58,670
as a consequence
of the wishes she made?

601
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:01,325
Yes, but her failure
to complete the wishes

602
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,632
also doomed me.

603
00:44:03,656 --> 00:44:05,764
Could nobody else
complete the wish?

604
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:07,331
That was my hope.

605
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,202
And that would
finally liberate you?

606
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:11,857
That was my only hope.

607
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:14,033
But you were rendered invisible.

608
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:15,121
Like a ghost.

609
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:16,949
Wandering unseen.

610
00:44:16,973 --> 00:44:18,211
And your bottle,

611
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,170
hidden under the loosened stone

612
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:21,737
known only to the dead Gulten.

613
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:23,652
Yes, it was a predicament.

614
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:27,699
I tried to attract
the attention of someone,

615
00:44:27,723 --> 00:44:29,333
anyone that could help me.

616
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:32,356
My stars, how I tried.

617
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,924
I followed their scent,
their every step.

618
00:44:34,948 --> 00:44:37,143
Willing, pleading, screaming.

619
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:39,015
Anything to draw them to me.

620
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:11,830
And I do this piteously
for 100 years,

621
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:15,094
and with every failure,
my will begins to fade.

622
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:23,842
And then in 1620,

623
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:27,478
hope comes in the form
of a boy with a sword.

624
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:36,487
Murad! Murad!

625
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,068
Murad!

626
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,273
By some means,
this boy senses me.

627
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:06,189
I'm able to draw him
to the stone.

628
00:46:55,305 --> 00:46:56,350
Ibrahim!

629
00:46:57,003 --> 00:46:58,265
Gel.

630
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,355
Murad!

631
00:47:02,878 --> 00:47:04,508
Ibrahim!

632
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:06,118
And just as
I am about to be delivered

633
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:07,424
into their hands,

634
00:47:07,448 --> 00:47:08,904
their mother finds them.

635
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:12,951
She is Kosem,

636
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:15,171
a widow of the Sultan,
Ahmed the First.

637
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:17,521
And the boys are next in line
for the throne.

638
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:22,831
When I see the hair on his legs,

639
00:47:22,855 --> 00:47:25,572
I know that somewhere
in Murad's bloodline

640
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,555
pulses the power of a djinn.

641
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,273
I follow him everywhere,

642
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:32,841
determined to draw him back
to the stone.

643
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:35,887
But at the age of 11,
he ascends the throne

644
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:37,976
and becomes
Sultan Murad the Fourth.

645
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,979
And caught up
by the usual intrigues,

646
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:44,287
he is even more lost to me.

647
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:47,246
At 20, he leads
his armies to war.

648
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,987
He battles alongside his men

649
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:51,361
in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia.

650
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,950
Stories are told
of his recklessness,

651
00:47:54,974 --> 00:47:57,169
even with his own life.

652
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:06,246
I despair of
ever seeing him again.

653
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:12,165
Hope is a monster, A lit he a,
and I am its plaything.

654
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,969
So he died?

655
00:48:13,993 --> 00:48:15,342
Not in battle.

656
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,189
Back in Istanbul,

657
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:19,322
Kosem needs
to protect the throne.

658
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:21,150
She needs to protect Ibrahim.

659
00:48:21,174 --> 00:48:23,021
- The little brother?
- Yes.

660
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,964
He is last of the Ottoman line.

661
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:32,272
He has to produce male children.

662
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:39,453
So, Kosem locks him in a cage
lined entirely with sable.

663
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:48,568
Quite the prison.

664
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,073
And one
he will never want to leave.

665
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:08,937
It debauches him royally.

666
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:11,591
He believes the greater
the expanse of flesh,

667
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,289
the more intense the pleasure.

668
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:17,249
So, Kosem seeks out beauties
voluptuous and immense,

669
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:20,470
and brings them to his couch.

670
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:24,474
My fate turns specifically
on this fetish.

671
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:25,760
How's that?

672
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,043
You'll see.

673
00:49:58,488 --> 00:50:00,292
Murad is back.

674
00:50:00,316 --> 00:50:02,164
And though
he returns a conqueror,

675
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:04,799
he cannot shed
his robes of blood.

676
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,474
War had truly rotted his soul.

677
00:50:28,388 --> 00:50:30,235
I wait until he is alone.

678
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:33,412
I am determined to draw him
back to the stone.

679
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:36,589
I don't want to interrupt,
but I do have a question.

680
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:38,635
Did it matter to you
what kind of wish

681
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:40,226
such a man might make?

682
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:42,508
One so insatiable.

683
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:44,336
No.

684
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,295
Not even if
it were profoundly evil?

685
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,818
Not if it meant my freedom.

686
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:51,715
The truth is he has
other things on his mind.

687
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:55,652
He believes he is invincible,

688
00:50:55,676 --> 00:51:00,072
and to rule indefinitely,
he must be rid of all rivals.

689
00:51:13,128 --> 00:51:14,216
Ibrahim.

690
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:18,742
Ibrahim.

691
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,913
Kosem needs to stop him.

692
00:52:22,937 --> 00:52:25,176
Somehow, she needed
to distract him

693
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,855
from his bloodlust
with other gratifications.

694
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:36,211
First, she arranges for him
to be perpetually drunk.

695
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,191
And then she tries
something very shrewd.

696
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:41,671
Something that you might enjoy.

697
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,287
She sends to find,

698
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:51,661
from all corners of the empire,

699
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:54,664
the best storytellers.

700
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,966
Those who are not persuasive

701
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:19,341
flee in fear
or fall to his impatience.

702
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:31,329
There is only one

703
00:53:31,353 --> 00:53:33,462
who has the ability
to enchant him.

704
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,596
To soothe with stories,

705
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,536
to hold him hostage
to their unfolding.

706
00:54:02,036 --> 00:54:04,038
This is his only friend.

707
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:09,609
And that friendship
turns to love.

708
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,676
Since there is nothing else
for me to do,

709
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,199
I listen gratefully,

710
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:18,400
for I, too, love being lost
in his stories.

711
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,644
When the old man dies,

712
00:54:25,668 --> 00:54:27,994
all in the palace
flee to the streets,

713
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:32,042
for they fear Murad's grief
will incur fresh murder.

714
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:41,510
But he just sits, and howls,
and drinks until he is empty.

715
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:10,452
And my patience is rewarded.

716
00:55:11,584 --> 00:55:12,996
For in this state,

717
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,346
I am finally able
to get his attention

718
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,306
and draw him
back to the secret bathroom.

719
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,872
Oh, I know where this is going.

720
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:22,484
He's going to be too weak
to lift the stone.

721
00:55:22,508 --> 00:55:25,095
Too weak even to turn the latch.

722
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,038
So, he leaves and drinks
himself to permanent sleep.

723
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:32,929
Oh!

724
00:55:32,953 --> 00:55:34,713
And there I am,

725
00:55:34,737 --> 00:55:37,063
left to my own oblivion,

726
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:39,588
with no one to hear my voice,

727
00:55:39,612 --> 00:55:42,939
no one to know me,
nor feel me, nor sense me.

728
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:45,357
You can't imagine.

729
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:50,362
Well, actually, I can.

730
00:55:51,363 --> 00:55:53,756
Can you imagine the loneliness?

731
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,629
How it might overwhelm?

732
00:55:56,846 --> 00:55:58,824
I can.

733
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:01,479
We exist only
if we are real to others.

734
00:56:01,503 --> 00:56:02,654
Do you agree?

735
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:03,916
I do.

736
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,571
This, then,
is our fate, A lit he a.

737
00:56:06,595 --> 00:56:09,705
If you make no wish at all,

738
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:11,446
I will be caught between worlds,

739
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,560
invisible and alone,
for all of time.

740
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:18,433
Make a wish, A lit he a.

741
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:21,393
Make it your heart's desire.

742
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,163
I'd be more careful
if I were you.

743
00:56:33,187 --> 00:56:35,426
Obviously, you managed
to find your way out.

744
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,688
More or less.

745
00:56:36,712 --> 00:56:38,037
I'm beginning to think
I'm in the presence

746
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,149
of a trickster.

747
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,695
That would be so much better.

748
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:45,567
My work would be so much easier.

749
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:48,439
But the truth is,
I am just an idiot

750
00:56:48,463 --> 00:56:51,050
who has been
extravagantly unlucky.

751
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,966
Well, I have to take
your word for that.

752
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:04,739
So?

753
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,070
Ibrahim, I suppose,
becomes Sultan?

754
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,640
Ibrahim has
to be dragged to the throne.

755
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:34,746
He
Appoints one of his concubines

756
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:36,487
Governor of Damascus.

757
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,011
Her name is Sugar Lump.

758
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:41,168
By every measure, his favorite.

759
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,017
Had she not been free to roam,

760
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:47,933
she would not have found
the secret bathroom.

761
00:57:47,957 --> 00:57:50,153
Had she not decided
to take a bath,

762
00:57:50,177 --> 00:57:52,634
it would not have overfilled.

763
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:53,939
Had she not been clumsy

764
00:57:53,963 --> 00:57:55,550
as she walked across the floor,

765
00:57:55,574 --> 00:57:57,837
she would not have slipped,
smashed the stone,

766
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:01,188
- and found my bottle.
- Ah, yeah.

767
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:21,967
To be honest, I should
have been more dignified.

768
00:58:21,991 --> 00:58:24,709
But I began to beg, shamelessly.

769
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:53,042
"I wish you were back"

770
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:56,069
"in your bottle at the bottom
of the Bosphorus."

771
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:00,310
So here I am,

772
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:02,902
fallen into your careful hands.

773
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,230
Seems we cannot
escape each other.

774
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:09,561
You have me at your mercy.

775
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,090
This wishing...

776
00:59:18,918 --> 00:59:21,026
It's a hazardous art.

777
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,855
"I wish" brings
infinite unravelings.

778
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:24,987
Not necessarily.

779
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:26,031
Well, it's there
in all your own stories.

780
00:59:26,055 --> 00:59:27,119
I know, but...

781
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:28,730
You say you're not a trickster,

782
00:59:28,754 --> 00:59:32,124
and you say that you and I
are the authors of this story.

783
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:35,171
But I'm not able
to write myself out of it.

784
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:36,433
Correct.

785
00:59:36,457 --> 00:59:40,176
Why don't you just hop back
into your bottle

786
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,917
and I'll give it
to someone more gullible?

787
00:59:41,941 --> 00:59:44,876
Someone more desperate.
Someone more greedy.

788
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,051
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

789
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:47,139
Why not?

790
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:48,967
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

791
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:50,969
Well, I am not
making three wishes.

792
00:59:50,993 --> 00:59:53,145
Then you are sending me
to my oblivion.

793
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:54,625
Oh, you're impossible.

794
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:56,627
And you are giving me
a headache.

795
00:59:56,651 --> 00:59:58,324
All right. All right.

796
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,892
Here's what I'll do.
I will make three wishes.

797
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:02,024
- I will.
- Before you die?

798
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:03,808
Right now.
One after the other.

799
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:05,027
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

800
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:07,749
Number one. I wish
your headache were gone.

801
01:00:10,752 --> 01:00:12,338
Number two.

802
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,321
I wish for a sip of this tea.

803
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:19,781
And finally, I wish
for another one of those.

804
01:00:19,805 --> 01:00:21,130
You mock me.

805
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:22,827
Three wishes, perfectly simple,

806
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:23,959
and theoretically safe.

807
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:26,048
I was imprisoned
by Solomon precisely

808
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:28,703
because I cried out
my heart's desire.

809
01:00:28,727 --> 01:00:31,619
Only by granting you yours
may I earn my release.

810
01:00:31,643 --> 01:00:33,055
Yes, well,
I appreciate the symmetry,

811
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,622
but the thing is this,

812
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:37,407
I cannot for the life of me
summon up one eligible wish.

813
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:38,887
And you're asking me for three.

814
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:41,150
Is there any life in you?
Are you even alive?

815
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:42,978
You know, in some cultures,

816
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:44,719
absence of desire
means enlightenment.

817
01:00:44,743 --> 01:00:46,938
Then you are a pious fool.

818
01:00:46,962 --> 01:00:49,201
If I'm content, why tempt fate?

819
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:50,638
And you're a coward.

820
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:51,987
Don't goad me.

821
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,945
There is no human,
no angel, nor djinn

822
01:00:53,969 --> 01:00:55,207
that wouldn't grasp
at the chance

823
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,861
to fulfill
their deepest longings,

824
01:00:56,885 --> 01:00:58,341
and I am saddled with the one

825
01:00:58,365 --> 01:00:59,864
who claims to want
nothing at all.

826
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:01,387
A lit he a Binnie,
you are a liar!

827
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:04,695
You know, I am beginning
to wish we never met.

828
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:06,001
No! Nyet!

829
01:01:06,025 --> 01:01:07,176
Don't say that!

830
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:39,362
So...

831
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:43,018
that's happened to you before.

832
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,215
And it was bad.

833
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:48,197
'Twas bad.

834
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,437
'Twas bitter.

835
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,812
'Twas the cruelest wish of all.

836
01:01:55,814 --> 01:01:58,706
You were undone
by silliness yet again.

837
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,429
I'm here because of a genius.

838
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:04,823
Who was it this time?

839
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:07,434
She was Zefir.

840
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:13,396
Rarely among humankind
has there been such a wonder.

841
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:17,270
But you're here
because of her folly.

842
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,146
I ended up in this
as a consequence of Zefir.

843
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,778
And this is the story

844
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:31,042
you've been avoiding
telling me all along.

845
01:02:31,066 --> 01:02:34,766
This is the story I've avoided
telling even myself.

846
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,930
Zefir was a foundling,

847
01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:51,521
married at 12
to a wealthy merchant.

848
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,327
He was much older than her,
and kind,

849
01:02:55,351 --> 01:03:00,811
if you think keeping someone
like a bird in a cage is kind.

850
01:03:00,835 --> 01:03:03,466
There were two older wives,
who did not like her

851
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,361
and did not talk to her at all.

852
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,140
Everyone,
including the servants,

853
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:26,818
seemed to be mocking her.

854
01:03:40,005 --> 01:03:43,071
She had neither
etiquette nor learning.

855
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:44,986
She grew to no great beauty

856
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,969
and was angry
without knowing why.

857
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:05,180
As the fates would have it,
my bottle came to her

858
01:04:05,204 --> 01:04:08,555
as a love token
from her husband.

859
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:16,626
And when she had finished
satisfying him

860
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,106
and was finally alone,

861
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,219
she managed to prise it open.

862
01:04:51,424 --> 01:04:54,055
It was as if
she was waiting for me.

863
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,188
I saw at once
that she was sharp,

864
01:04:57,212 --> 01:05:01,062
and she saw that I was desperate

865
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:03,281
for freedom and conversation.

866
01:05:03,305 --> 01:05:06,023
I told her my story,
as I have told you,

867
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:10,288
and she revealed herself to me
by the things she had made.

868
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:12,271
Gel. Gel.

869
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:48,655
Gel.

870
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,339
She could have been remembered

871
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:03,254
like the genius da Vinci,

872
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:04,647
whose theories on flight

873
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,239
were the talk
of sultans and kings.

874
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:12,418
She was a skilled artist,
but no one saw her art.

875
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:21,272
She told me she was eaten up

876
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:23,492
with unused power.

877
01:06:23,516 --> 01:06:25,300
She thought
she might be a witch.

878
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:28,279
Except, she said,
if she were a man,

879
01:06:28,303 --> 01:06:32,109
her intellect would have been
ordinarily accepted.

880
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,459
She was a woman
ardent for learning,

881
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:37,723
and I knew
what her first wish would be.

882
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:56,742
And it delighted me

883
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:58,638
to fulfill this wish.

884
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,255
So, I taught her
histories, philosophies,

885
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:32,691
languages, poetry.

886
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,346
I taught her
astronomy, mathematic,

887
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:37,522
which was bliss to her.

888
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:40,090
I brought her
books and writings,

889
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:43,465
which we hid
in her collection of bottles.

890
01:08:03,877 --> 01:08:05,855
Sabah...

891
01:08:05,879 --> 01:08:07,335
Sabah...

892
01:08:25,246 --> 01:08:27,268
She could always
call on Aristotle

893
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:29,444
from a red glass jar,

894
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:32,229
or Euclid from a green,

895
01:08:32,253 --> 01:08:34,623
Pythagoras, Spinoza,

896
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:37,495
without needing me
to re-embody them.

897
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:50,117
We had the whole world
in her room,

898
01:08:50,141 --> 01:08:53,144
and I lost my heart to her.

899
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,890
'Twas my bliss
to make her happy.

900
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:03,937
To see her flourish.

901
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:08,246
And she flourished in every way.

902
01:09:08,637 --> 01:09:10,161
Totalmente.

903
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:22,671
She began to rebel

904
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:24,760
even against
the gestures of submission

905
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:26,327
that her husband required,

906
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:29,547
for she had acquired
a mastery of love-craft,

907
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:31,201
out of reach of any human

908
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:33,401
that had not
made love to a djinn.

909
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:54,398
His cravings
for her became an obsession.

910
01:10:04,693 --> 01:10:06,323
And when he would come to her,

911
01:10:06,347 --> 01:10:10,675
I would leave her room
and journey the skies.

912
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:14,442
I saw the mountains,
the oceans...

913
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,378
I saw the beasts of the forest,

914
01:10:17,402 --> 01:10:19,945
where no man treads.

915
01:10:19,969 --> 01:10:23,993
And when I would return,
she would be waiting for me.

916
01:10:24,017 --> 01:10:27,910
I would tell her of my day,
and she would faint with joy

917
01:10:27,934 --> 01:10:29,912
and disappointment.

918
01:10:29,936 --> 01:10:33,524
Why did she not
make a wish to be free?

919
01:10:33,548 --> 01:10:36,919
There was something
more important to her.

920
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:39,400
She had devised a "mathematica,"

921
01:10:39,424 --> 01:10:42,577
a language to explain the forces

922
01:10:42,601 --> 01:10:45,710
which bring space, and time,
and matter into being.

923
01:10:45,734 --> 01:10:47,364
She was Promethean, brave.

924
01:10:47,388 --> 01:10:49,627
But she could not solve
this puzzle.

925
01:10:49,651 --> 01:10:51,716
She needed a key,

926
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,743
a key to open the doors
of her perception.

927
01:11:05,537 --> 01:11:09,430
So, she used her second wish.

928
01:11:09,454 --> 01:11:13,022
I taught her to dream
as djinn do, awake.

929
01:11:44,706 --> 01:11:48,599
And this way,
the solutions came to her.

930
01:11:48,623 --> 01:11:52,342
She was able
to explain powers invisible,

931
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:55,563
electromagnetic fields
and forces...

932
01:11:55,587 --> 01:11:58,696
The very stuff
of which djinn are made.

933
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,437
You're electromagnetic?

934
01:12:00,461 --> 01:12:04,509
As you are dust,
I am made of subtle fire.

935
01:12:05,379 --> 01:12:07,792
And when she was
to bear a child,

936
01:12:07,816 --> 01:12:10,099
I was plagued with happiness,

937
01:12:10,123 --> 01:12:12,362
for I knew
it would strengthen us.

938
01:12:12,386 --> 01:12:13,909
She was carrying your child?

939
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:17,696
A child, of fire and dust.

940
01:12:19,654 --> 01:12:21,632
So, where did it go wrong?

941
01:12:21,656 --> 01:12:23,658
A lit he a, I loved her.

942
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:26,376
I loved the fervor of her mind.

943
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,508
I loved her anger.

944
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:28,639
I loved my power

945
01:12:28,663 --> 01:12:31,710
to turn her frowns into smiles.

946
01:12:33,451 --> 01:12:35,907
I loved her more than Sheba.

947
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:37,474
More than your own freedom?

948
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:38,954
Yes.

949
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:42,479
It became my greatest desire
to... to keep her,

950
01:12:42,503 --> 01:12:44,612
to remain her prisoner.

951
01:12:44,636 --> 01:12:49,356
The thought of being set free
sickened my heart.

952
01:12:54,385 --> 01:12:58,389
I caught myself stopping her
lest she make her third wish.

953
01:12:58,693 --> 01:13:00,129
Oh, gosh.

954
01:13:03,785 --> 01:13:05,613
I made a mess of it.

955
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,028
She began to accuse me
of trapping her,

956
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,769
like her husband.

957
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:16,992
I tried to make amends.

958
01:13:17,016 --> 01:13:20,672
To atone, I would
put myself in the bottle.

959
01:13:21,586 --> 01:13:23,128
To be sealed.

960
01:13:23,152 --> 01:13:25,590
That way, she could have
more power over me.

961
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:40,929
To be nothing in a bottle.

962
01:13:40,953 --> 01:13:42,607
I could do that for her.

963
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:47,109
And every time,
it would appease.

964
01:13:47,133 --> 01:13:50,721
Every time, except for the last.

965
01:13:50,745 --> 01:13:55,465
When, like a sudden squall,
all thunder and lightning,

966
01:13:55,489 --> 01:13:58,468
she began to weep and wail,
and said,

967
01:13:58,492 --> 01:14:01,558
"I wish I could forget
I ever met you."

968
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:09,764
And she did, on the instant.

969
01:14:14,856 --> 01:14:17,748
She was out. I was in.

970
01:14:17,772 --> 01:14:19,513
She'd forgotten me.

971
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:24,039
A lit he a, how can it be...

972
01:14:26,085 --> 01:14:29,480
a mistake to love
someone entirely?

973
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:56,202
I have a wish.

974
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:04,210
However, I'm afraid it may be
too much to ask.

975
01:15:08,823 --> 01:15:10,912
Is it within my power?

976
01:15:11,565 --> 01:15:14,525
I hope so. I do hope so.

977
01:15:17,136 --> 01:15:19,225
Is it your heart's desire?

978
01:15:19,878 --> 01:15:21,923
Yeah, I'm certain of it.

979
01:15:36,677 --> 01:15:37,939
See, erm,

980
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:40,942
I'm here to love you.

981
01:15:43,815 --> 01:15:45,077
And, uh,

982
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,082
I wish for you
to love me in return.

983
01:15:51,866 --> 01:15:54,739
You want us to make love-craft?

984
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,282
Yeah, that too.

985
01:15:57,306 --> 01:15:58,457
All of it.

986
01:15:58,481 --> 01:16:02,592
And you would
abandon yourself to this?

987
01:16:04,357 --> 01:16:06,030
Yes.

988
01:16:06,054 --> 01:16:07,229
Yes.

989
01:16:09,318 --> 01:16:13,298
I want our solitudes
to be together.

990
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:18,042
I want that love
professed in ageless tales.

991
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:22,569
I want that longing you felt
for the Queen of Sheba,

992
01:16:22,593 --> 01:16:26,311
and that love you gave
to your genius, Zefir.

993
01:16:26,335 --> 01:16:28,120
I want it.

994
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:42,308
Me?

995
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:45,790
You.

996
01:16:52,666 --> 01:16:53,972
You?

997
01:16:55,887 --> 01:16:57,149
Me.

998
01:17:04,678 --> 01:17:06,027
Is it too much?

999
01:17:07,115 --> 01:17:09,248
Is it all too much to ask?

1000
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:29,834
Come.

1001
01:17:43,151 --> 01:17:46,653
What are we to do
with longings awoken?

1002
01:17:46,677 --> 01:17:48,089
How can I persuade you

1003
01:17:48,113 --> 01:17:50,332
that I once found love
with a djinn?

1004
01:17:52,683 --> 01:17:55,381
In any case,
few would believe me.

1005
01:17:57,165 --> 01:18:00,691
Love is not something
we come to by reason.

1006
01:18:03,084 --> 01:18:05,149
It's more like a vapor,

1007
01:18:05,173 --> 01:18:07,325
a dream, perhaps,

1008
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,284
to lure us into the enchantment

1009
01:18:09,308 --> 01:18:11,049
of our own stories.

1010
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:14,332
If that's so,

1011
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,402
how are we to know
if it's ever real?

1012
01:18:18,317 --> 01:18:21,992
Is it a truth,
or simply a madness?

1013
01:19:08,933 --> 01:19:11,302
I leave for London today.

1014
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:12,937
Will you come home with me?

1015
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:18,072
It's not such
an easy place nowadays.

1016
01:19:19,247 --> 01:19:21,423
But it'll be better
if you're there.

1017
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,522
Over here, please.

1018
01:19:35,176 --> 01:19:36,308
Hands up.

1019
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,903
Please step out.

1020
01:19:46,927 --> 01:19:48,363
What is in your pockets?

1021
01:19:49,016 --> 01:19:50,104
Oh.

1022
01:19:51,105 --> 01:19:54,326
Uh, it's an empty bottle
and a top.

1023
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:56,913
Please put it through X-ray.

1024
01:19:56,937 --> 01:19:58,045
It is very delicate,

1025
01:19:58,069 --> 01:19:59,437
and I don't want it
to get damaged.

1026
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,265
It will not be damaged.
Please put through X-ray.

1027
01:20:01,289 --> 01:20:02,440
I would prefer that
it didn't go in the...

1028
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,814
Passport. Boarding pass.

1029
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,207
Thank you.

1030
01:20:16,609 --> 01:20:17,847
It's quite fragile.

1031
01:20:17,871 --> 01:20:19,003
Madam.

1032
01:20:23,268 --> 01:20:25,052
It's a saltshaker.

1033
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:33,844
Oh.

1034
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:36,561
No! No X-ray! Please!

1035
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:38,849
Stop, madam, stop.

1036
01:20:55,343 --> 01:20:56,431
Madam.

1037
01:20:56,997 --> 01:20:58,085
Oh.

1038
01:21:38,952 --> 01:21:40,345
In your own time.

1039
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:39,099
The air is thick here.

1040
01:22:40,187 --> 01:22:44,278
Full of insistent voices
and rushing faces.

1041
01:22:44,757 --> 01:22:46,474
Oh?

1042
01:22:46,498 --> 01:22:49,259
Like Tiny Einstein?

1043
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:51,435
Television, and phone towers,
and such?

1044
01:22:51,459 --> 01:22:53,176
Yes.

1045
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,963
Yes. All your
ingenious devices

1046
01:22:56,987 --> 01:22:58,747
all murmuring at once.

1047
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:00,618
Bend your head.

1048
01:23:07,345 --> 01:23:09,410
You hear all that?

1049
01:23:12,263 --> 01:23:15,242
I also see it and feel it.

1050
01:23:15,266 --> 01:23:18,245
I am a transmitter.

1051
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:20,010
Isn't it all too much?

1052
01:23:21,185 --> 01:23:22,466
I am a djinn.

1053
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:23,665
I can adapt.

1054
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,341
I'll soon get used to it.

1055
01:23:27,365 --> 01:23:29,212
She's back.

1056
01:23:29,236 --> 01:23:30,561
I believe she's back.

1057
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:32,520
Is she with someone?

1058
01:23:32,544 --> 01:23:34,565
No, I think she's
talking to herself again.

1059
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:36,306
Hello, Clementine.

1060
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:38,656
Fanny. Are you well?

1061
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,484
Did you have any trouble?

1062
01:23:40,508 --> 01:23:42,660
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

1063
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,488
With your foreign friends.

1064
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,403
Because we often ask ourselves,

1065
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:49,102
"Why would Dr. Binnie waste
her time and intelligence"

1066
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:51,800
"studying the ways of others
instead of upholding our own?"

1067
01:23:51,824 --> 01:23:54,324
Embarrassed by
our British culture, are we?

1068
01:23:54,348 --> 01:23:55,804
No. No.

1069
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:58,198
I am rather more likely
to be embarrassed by anybody

1070
01:23:58,222 --> 01:24:00,548
reflexly frightened
of anybody different.

1071
01:24:00,572 --> 01:24:01,679
What exactly are you saying?

1072
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,464
She's calling us bigots.

1073
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:04,508
Your word, not mine.

1074
01:24:04,532 --> 01:24:05,640
You misunderstand.

1075
01:24:05,664 --> 01:24:07,163
- Oh?
- It's not how they look, dear.

1076
01:24:07,187 --> 01:24:08,686
It's how they live.
What they believe.

1077
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,427
- What they eat.
- What are you on about?

1078
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:12,255
Everywhere one goes, ethnics.

1079
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:15,258
We are being overwhelmed,
and we're inviting our doom.

1080
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:16,607
It's not natural.

1081
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:18,740
Birds belong in the air.
Fish belong in the sea.

1082
01:24:18,764 --> 01:24:21,047
And that is how the good Lord
meant us to be.

1083
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:23,092
You're just spouting rubbish
from start to finish.

1084
01:24:23,116 --> 01:24:24,615
It's science.
It's a scientific fact.

1085
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:25,877
It's a false analogy.

1086
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:28,141
I mean, animals do have
a natural habitat.

1087
01:24:28,165 --> 01:24:30,360
It's true,
but human beings are capable

1088
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:32,493
of living in any environment
they bloody well choose.

1089
01:24:32,517 --> 01:24:33,711
That's not a fact.

1090
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,365
- What are you saying?
- It's an opinion.

1091
01:24:35,389 --> 01:24:36,584
And you're wrong.

1092
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:38,064
I'm not putting up
with any more of this.

1093
01:24:38,088 --> 01:24:40,283
Come away, Clem.
Let the crazy lady be.

1094
01:24:40,307 --> 01:24:42,198
We're never gonna get
any sense out of her.

1095
01:24:42,222 --> 01:24:44,503
You know, I've never
said this to you before.

1096
01:24:45,138 --> 01:24:47,551
But you're both pitiful.

1097
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:48,770
Shut your cake hole!

1098
01:24:48,794 --> 01:24:51,362
Pea-brained and pitiful.

1099
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:54,254
You, fuck face!

1100
01:24:54,278 --> 01:24:58,282
Stop your ivy growing
on our side of the wall!

1101
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,522
Why do I let them get to me?

1102
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:03,611
I should feel sorry for them.

1103
01:25:03,635 --> 01:25:06,831
But this is my home.
It's my sanctuary.

1104
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:13,123
I could wish them...

1105
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:16,363
That's not a wish, by the way.

1106
01:25:16,387 --> 01:25:17,755
I know.

1107
01:27:21,425 --> 01:27:22,687
My djinn.

1108
01:27:23,731 --> 01:27:24,926
How was your day?

1109
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:27,320
Every listening ear was yours.

1110
01:27:27,344 --> 01:27:29,931
Every voice, every scent,
and touch.

1111
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:31,696
You were everywhere.

1112
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,616
Back in a minute.

1113
01:27:57,678 --> 01:27:59,787
Whoever could that be
at this hour?

1114
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:00,931
It could be her.

1115
01:28:04,381 --> 01:28:07,297
Clem. Fanny.

1116
01:28:09,342 --> 01:28:11,823
Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

1117
01:28:13,651 --> 01:28:15,348
They melt in your mouth.

1118
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:34,846
This is my friend.

1119
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,892
He'll be staying for a while.

1120
01:28:38,806 --> 01:28:39,851
Hello.

1121
01:28:42,941 --> 01:28:44,682
- Hello.
- Hello.

1122
01:28:48,947 --> 01:28:50,707
My Djinn told me,

1123
01:28:50,731 --> 01:28:53,667
when they come together
in the Realm of Djinn,

1124
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:55,475
they tell each other stories.

1125
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:58,759
Stories are like breath to them.

1126
01:28:58,783 --> 01:28:59,871
They make meaning.

1127
01:29:01,829 --> 01:29:03,067
"Yes," I said.

1128
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:04,876
"That's just how
it is with us."

1129
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,637
Each story we tell is a fragment

1130
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:10,098
in an endless
shape-shifting mosaic.

1131
01:29:11,665 --> 01:29:15,800
And this small pebble,
like all stories, must end.

1132
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:20,935
If it's about wishing,
it's a cautionary tale.

1133
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,002
So, how will it go wrong?

1134
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:27,551
Perhaps, it already has.

1135
01:29:30,858 --> 01:29:33,359
Even though Truth
stood before them naked,

1136
01:29:33,383 --> 01:29:35,012
they turned their backs.

1137
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:39,495
So, Truth moved to the side
and waited in the shadows.

1138
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:41,149
In the days that followed,

1139
01:29:41,173 --> 01:29:44,674
the Djinn would accompany
the narratologist to her work.

1140
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:46,284
And when he wasn't with her,

1141
01:29:46,308 --> 01:29:49,505
he would go in eager
exploration of the world.

1142
01:29:52,489 --> 01:29:55,405
Today I had
such a marvelous day.

1143
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:59,689
I saw many things.

1144
01:29:59,713 --> 01:30:03,867
I watched a human look into
the living brain of another

1145
01:30:03,891 --> 01:30:06,503
and arrest a fatal bleeding.

1146
01:30:10,985 --> 01:30:12,770
I visited the Collider.

1147
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:18,515
A vast gizmo which probed
the essence of matter.

1148
01:30:21,648 --> 01:30:24,888
And then I saw a dish,
a great dish

1149
01:30:24,912 --> 01:30:28,612
that listens to the whispers
of stars long dead.

1150
01:30:30,744 --> 01:30:32,722
Humankind is...

1151
01:30:32,746 --> 01:30:34,661
is a wonder, A lit he a.

1152
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:37,988
I'm happy you think so.

1153
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:41,078
All of this since I was
trapped in Zefir's bottle.

1154
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:45,866
All these astonishments,
in less than 200 years.

1155
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,868
Yes, but, I mean,

1156
01:30:47,892 --> 01:30:52,176
that's just engineering
and technology.

1157
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,788
Despite all the whiz-bang,

1158
01:30:54,812 --> 01:30:56,944
we remain bewildered.

1159
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,819
When we can't contain the chaos,

1160
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:06,190
we are filled
with dread and panic,

1161
01:31:06,214 --> 01:31:08,497
and we turn on each other.

1162
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:11,021
But of course, you are human.

1163
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:13,178
That is your nature.

1164
01:31:15,528 --> 01:31:18,966
Yeah. So, the story
never changes.

1165
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,555
Hate prevails.

1166
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:27,192
It metastasizes
and outlives love.

1167
01:31:28,976 --> 01:31:31,607
I just want to talk about love.

1168
01:31:31,631 --> 01:31:35,655
Such a mess of
contradictions, all of you.

1169
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:36,786
Thank you very much.

1170
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:40,094
Humankind, what a conundrum.

1171
01:31:40,118 --> 01:31:42,836
You fumble around in the dark,

1172
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:45,969
and yet, you herd your
intelligence to great effect.

1173
01:31:45,993 --> 01:31:47,623
It is quite a story.

1174
01:31:48,909 --> 01:31:51,758
Cannot wait to see
where it goes.

1175
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:53,697
Or how it might end.

1176
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:55,762
That too.

1177
01:31:55,786 --> 01:31:59,722
A mortal will never know,
but a djinn might.

1178
01:31:59,746 --> 01:32:02,227
A djinn has all the time
in the world.

1179
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:06,512
Aren't you the lucky one?

1180
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:07,885
Maybe.

1181
01:32:08,886 --> 01:32:12,126
But you creatures
of dust have...

1182
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:13,649
have managed to eclipse

1183
01:32:13,673 --> 01:32:17,000
the power and purpose
of djinn and angel.

1184
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,220
You have no use for us.

1185
01:32:19,244 --> 01:32:20,613
Perhaps, we will wither and...

1186
01:32:20,637 --> 01:32:22,136
- And fade away?
- Yes.

1187
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,573
Yeah. Well, that used
to be the subject

1188
01:32:24,597 --> 01:32:26,662
of all my lectures and papers.

1189
01:32:26,686 --> 01:32:27,992
I know.

1190
01:32:30,603 --> 01:32:32,344
And yet, here you are.

1191
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,130
My impossible.

1192
01:32:38,045 --> 01:32:39,133
Yes.

1193
01:32:51,581 --> 01:32:52,756
Hello?

1194
01:32:58,196 --> 01:32:59,806
I'm home!

1195
01:33:09,773 --> 01:33:11,078
Hello?

1196
01:33:37,104 --> 01:33:38,671
Djinn?

1197
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:43,913
My love?

1198
01:33:47,941 --> 01:33:48,986
Djinn.

1199
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:54,382
What's this?

1200
01:33:56,994 --> 01:33:58,972
Can you hear me?

1201
01:33:58,996 --> 01:34:01,148
Djinn, speak to me.

1202
01:34:01,172 --> 01:34:02,739
Try to speak to me.

1203
01:34:04,697 --> 01:34:06,873
I wish you to speak to me.

1204
01:34:10,877 --> 01:34:11,965
Oh...

1205
01:34:26,893 --> 01:34:28,915
I was sleeping.

1206
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:31,158
Sleeping.

1207
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:35,008
Djinn don't sleep.

1208
01:34:35,032 --> 01:34:36,313
Let's go for a walk.

1209
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,793
A long, bracing walk.

1210
01:34:37,817 --> 01:34:39,360
I have prepared
something for us.

1211
01:34:39,384 --> 01:34:40,970
I have it all planned.

1212
01:34:40,994 --> 01:34:43,146
A wonderous night for us.

1213
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:45,322
It will be amazing.

1214
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:48,151
- The best time of our lives.
- Stop!

1215
01:34:48,175 --> 01:34:52,286
These electromagnetic fields,
I can push them from my head.

1216
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:53,877
I can push them away.

1217
01:34:54,965 --> 01:34:56,159
We'll go for a picnic.

1218
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:03,253
Ah, we'll play the ukulele.

1219
01:35:05,845 --> 01:35:09,129
A lit he a, there is a place
for me here.

1220
01:35:09,153 --> 01:35:10,391
These forces,

1221
01:35:10,415 --> 01:35:12,088
they will never go away,
not from this world.

1222
01:35:12,112 --> 01:35:14,308
I will overcome them.
I can do that for you.

1223
01:35:14,332 --> 01:35:16,484
You are my A lit he a,
and I love you.

1224
01:35:16,508 --> 01:35:18,268
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

1225
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:19,572
You don't think that I love you?

1226
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:22,708
Love is a gift.

1227
01:35:22,732 --> 01:35:25,101
It's a gift of oneself
given freely.

1228
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:27,345
It's not something
one can ever ask for.

1229
01:35:28,868 --> 01:35:30,063
I tricked us both.

1230
01:35:30,087 --> 01:35:31,760
The moment I spoke that wish,

1231
01:35:31,784 --> 01:35:34,850
I took away
your power to grant it.

1232
01:35:34,874 --> 01:35:39,115
I, more than anybody,
I should've known that.

1233
01:35:39,139 --> 01:35:41,291
I'm not going
to screw this up again.

1234
01:35:41,315 --> 01:35:45,469
My Djinn, if this world
is not for you,

1235
01:35:45,493 --> 01:35:48,366
I wish that you return
to where you belong.

1236
01:35:49,193 --> 01:35:51,282
Wherever that may be.

1237
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:19,647
Mommy!

1238
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:23,671
Come here, little monkey.

1239
01:38:23,695 --> 01:38:25,499
That's not Mommy.

1240
01:39:53,263 --> 01:39:54,501
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Ah, no!

1241
01:39:54,525 --> 01:39:56,527
Watch it.
Top striker in the league.

1242
01:40:05,492 --> 01:40:06,624
Did you see that?

1243
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:12,736
He would visit
from time to time,

1244
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,218
and they would grasp
each vivid moment.

1245
01:40:16,242 --> 01:40:19,134
Despite the pain
of the raucous skies,

1246
01:40:19,158 --> 01:40:21,789
he always stayed
longer than he should,

1247
01:40:21,813 --> 01:40:24,163
long after
she begged him to leave.

1248
01:40:25,295 --> 01:40:28,491
He promised to return
in her lifetime,

1249
01:40:28,515 --> 01:40:31,518
and for her,
that was more than enough.
