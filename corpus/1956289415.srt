1
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:52,815
Thousands of miles of tunnels
run across the United States.

2
00:00:52,948 --> 00:01:02,675
Abandoned subway lines, road
networks and deserted mines.

3
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:08,784
Many are no longer in use.

4
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:20,459
<i>Tonight's storm is causing all
kinds of problems around the bay.</i>

5
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:22,187
<i>Bea Givens will
have the forecast.</i>

6
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:24,585
<i>And we'll show you what
would happen to the bay</i>

7
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,937
<i>if some scientist's
predictions come true.</i>

8
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,180
<i>All on 7 at 11.</i>

9
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:36,135
<i>What has 12 million eyes,
192 million teeth,</i>

10
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,057
<i>and stretches from
the Golden Gate Bridge</i>

11
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:40,150
<i>all the way to the Twin Towers?</i>

12
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:42,064
<i>It's Hands Across America.</i>

13
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:44,876
<i>A 4,000-mile-long chain
of Good Samaritans</i>

14
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,220
<i>standing hand-in-hand</i>

15
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,799
<i>through fields of grains,
past purple mountains,</i>

16
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:51,705
<i>and across fruited plains</i>

17
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,932
<i>from sea to shining sea.</i>

18
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:55,246
<i>That's right!</i>

19
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:58,778
<i>This summer, 6 million people
will tether themselves together</i>

20
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:00,840
<i>to fight hunger in
the United States.</i>

21
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,801
<i>Visit your local
record shop to find out</i>

22
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:05,700
<i>how you can be a part
of Hands Across America.</i>

23
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,153
Put some meat on that one.

24
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,598
Yeah, I guess I missed
my chance to go pro.

25
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,512
Oh, shh...

26
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:25,520
Tell you what...

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,871
Right now, you could walk away
with a prize from the second level

28
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:32,286
or you could keep going for
a prize from the third level.

29
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,995
Okay, what do you think,
Addie, should we stop...

30
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,989
or keep going?

31
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,457
Don't look at me,
it's your birthday.

32
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,353
I want number 11.

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,619
Yeah?

34
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,525
That one?

35
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,314
- Yeah.
- All right.

36
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,227
Uh, yeah, that one.

37
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:54,010
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah.

39
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,041
That shirt better not
give her nightmares.

40
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:05,830
In trouble for winning
my daughter a t-shirt.

41
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,424
Haha, that's a new one.

42
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,877
She was terrified
when that came on TV.

43
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:18,722
You know...

44
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:20,979
You know they're filming
something by the carousel,

45
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,732
you should see if they're
looking for extras.

46
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:25,472
Ahh, I need another beer.

47
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,894
- Hm.
- I can't have a beer now?

48
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,440
Hey, how about the Big Dipper?

49
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:38,815
Addie, do you wanna try it?

50
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,946
Russel, you know she's
not big enough to do that.

51
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,714
And I, sure as hell,
am not doing it, so.

52
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,485
Whac-a-Mole!

53
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,453
Yeah, Whac-a-Mole guy,
that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

54
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,501
How many tickets?

55
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:56,509
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets!

56
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,056
Two tickets!

57
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:02,970
- Hey, Addie, come to the bathroom.
- I don't have to go.

58
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,976
Russel?

59
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:10,860
Russel.

60
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:12,664
Can you watch your
daughter, please?

61
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,359
I'm watchin'!

62
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,375
Baby, stay close, okay?

63
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,918
Oh, my God!

64
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,465
<i>And Sotuknang went
to Taiowa and said,</i>

65
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:24,238
<i>I want you to see
what I have done,</i>

66
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,777
<i>I have done well.</i>

67
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,494
<i>Taiowa looked and said,</i>

68
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,275
<i>It is very good,</i>

69
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:32,157
<i>but you are not done yet.</i>

<i>Now you must create life

71
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,778
<i>set it in motion

72
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:30,955

83
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,337
You guys sleep too much.

84
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:14,712
Come on, let's go.

85
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,119
Careful.

86
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,751
Hey, back to the house, first!

87
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:20,978
What, what, what?

88
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,477
Ew.

89
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:23,516
Come on.

90
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:24,758
You're too old.

91
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,008
Don't judge me.

92
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,525
Don't judge me.

93
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:29,845
Lil dude.

94
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,533
The Wi-Fi's not working.

95
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,819
You don't need the internet,
you got the outernet.

96
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,163
Good one.

97
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:38,071
Knock, knock.

98
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:39,134
Who's there?

99
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,572
- You.
- You who?

100
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:44,000
Yoo-hoo!
Open up the door!

101
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,355
My gosh,
what's wrong with you?

102
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:47,769
Can we get a dog?

103
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:48,886
No, we can't.

104
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,217
You should run
while you're here.

105
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,268
Jason, eat something.
Something.

106
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,230
What?

107
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,857
What's with all the attitude?

108
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:55,934
I'm sorry.

109
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,592
Yay! Track and field.

110
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:58,771
Whoa.

111
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,216
You don't want to run anymore?

112
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:01,466
You love track and field.

113
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:02,888
Eh, what's the point?

114
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,028
The Olympics.

115
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,066
I'm not gonna make it
to the Olympics, guys.

116
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,591
You could do anything
you set your mind to.

117
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,151
Can I drive while we're here?

118
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,176
- No.
- No.

119
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,153
Well, that's what I set
my mind to.

120
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,244
Where are you going, Jason?

121
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,716
- Jason?
- I'm getting something.

122
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,947
You need to come
and finish your food.

123
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,575
Sarah and Hailey drove
with parent supervision.

124
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,280
Yeah, well, you don't need
to know how to drive

125
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,010
when you're an
Olympic-caliber athlete.

126
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:24,922
My God.

127
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:26,705
You run.
You run on the sand.

128
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:27,682
Why?

129
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,823
Because it's harder.

130
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,658
Okay? No traction.

131
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,424
Practice on the beach,
you get on dry land,

132
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,463
you take off.

133
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,776
We're going to the beach?

134
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,065
Yeah.

135
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:39,830
Well, later, once we get settled.

136
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,445
What beach?

137
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:43,007
Santa Cruz.

138
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,952
Josh, Kitty and the girls
are gonna be there.

139
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,997
What are you doing?

140
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,493
It's a magic trick.

141
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,173
I left it here last year.

142
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,946
Okay, let's see it.

143
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,140
This thing's kinda bullshit.

144
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,196
Hey!

145
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,290
What, are we cursing
at the table now?

146
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:11,176
When you point a
finger at someone else,

147
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,001
you have three
pointing back at you.

148
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:17,717
What's that supposed to mean?

149
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,701
That's four fingers
pointing back at you.

150
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,601
So, what is it?

151
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:32,024
I think she has post-traumatic
stress disorder.

152
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,191
She wasn't in 'Nam.

153
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,120
Okay, she got lost.

154
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,143
For 15 minutes, that's...

155
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,449
That can be very scary.

156
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,250
You don't know what
happened to her.

157
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,209
Anything coulda happened to her.

158
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, so-so, h-how do we
get her to talk?

159
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:50,088
Look, I think we need to
encourage her to draw,

160
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,097
to write, to dance.

161
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:55,571
Anything to help her
tell us her story.

162
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,727
I just want my little girl back.

163
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:03,126
It's gonna be okay.

164
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,780
I need to have a smoke.

165
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,936
We have a summer home
by the beach

166
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:03,591
and don't go to the beach.

167
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:04,912
What about the beach right here?

168
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:05,850
What beach?

169
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,206
There is a beach right there.

170
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,331
That is not a beach.

171
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:10,428
That is a bay, that is a shore.

172
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,163
I'm talking about a real beach

173
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,501
with people and sand,
an amusement park.

174
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:17,578
There's, like,
it's crowded there, and, like...

175
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,866
There's weirdos at the beach...

176
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,889
I-I'm not going to that beach.

177
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,092
We're not going.

178
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:26,162
Okay, I guess
I can just cancel then.

179
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:27,758
Okay.

180
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,562
It just sucks, is all.

181
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,328
I mean,

182
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:35,258
you know, Jason really was
looking forward to it.

183
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,601
It's the first time we've
been back here since

184
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,742
Grandma died. I know it's

185
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:41,570
been pretty hard on him.

186
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,867
We leave before dark.

187
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:51,187
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

188
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,969
It's gonna be great.
You're gonna enjoy it.

189
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,702
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:57,163
Mm-hmm.

191
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:58,961
Are you really
not gonna kiss me?

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,281
Mm-mm.

193
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:04,203
You not gon' kiss me?
Hmm?

194
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:12,484
Where's your brother?

195
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:14,703
Your brother, where is he?

196
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:16,820
I don't know.

197
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,124
Really.

198
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:34,835
Jason?

199
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,680
Baby, that's why
you can't play in here.

200
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,186
Didn't this happen last year?

201
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,828
Zora, please.

202
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,873
Yeah!

203
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:15,366
That's right!

204
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:17,280
What is this?

205
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:21,694
Daddy's next home, baby!

206
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,195
Craw Daddy!

207
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,913
Ha-ha!

208
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,114
He's kidding, right?

209
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,966
He is not kidding.

210
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,407
It's got a cassette player
and everything!

211
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,721
Bucket seats!

212
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:34,828
Storage compartments!

213
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,938
Wow.

214
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:38,518
That's right.

215
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,274
It's even got
one of these, baby!

216
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:45,992
Oh, I got it, I got it.

217
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,523
They taught me how to do this.

218
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,328
It veers a little to the left,
so you gotta hold on to it.

219
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:01,187
Least, I got it really cheap.

220
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,977
Will we all fit, though?

221
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:04,164
You know, what?

222
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,125
Y'all are spoiled.

223
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:12,191
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

224
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,762
Spoiled!

225
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,903
Did you know that there's
fluoride in the water

226
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:29,396
that the government uses
to control our minds?

227
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,947
I forgot,

228
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:37,244
nobody cares about
the end of the world.

229
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,371
Maybe you could just tell us
what's supposed to happen

230
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:45,877
and then we can picture it.

231
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,682
Maybe you could
kiss my anus, Zora.

232
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,909
- Ew!
- Whoa, whoa!

233
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,150
Anus isn't a cuss word.

234
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,666
Why are you even
talking about anuses?

235
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:55,018
Why would you say that?

236
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,440
I would've actually,

237
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,572
preferred you use a curse
word, in this case.

238
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:01,307
Mom, I can see you laughing.

239
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,752
I am not laughing.

240
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,001
Where did you even learn that?

241
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,862
Okay, we don't always
have to be talking.

00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,039
Five minutes.

279
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,300
She can't even talk.

280
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:37,175
I don't why she can't talk.

281
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:38,245
What's gonna happen?

282
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,174
- If something happened...
- What's gonna happen? Okay.

283
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:41,230
She left!

284
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:47,468
My God.

285
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:48,511
Don't look.

286
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,948
- Is he dead?
- Don't look!

287
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,963
You gotta be kidding me.

288
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:42,119
Hey!

289
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:43,447
Hey, what's up?

290
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:46,007
I thought you guys said 2:30.
Where's the efficiency?

291
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:48,552
Wilsons, you know
we take our time.

292
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,896
- Hey!
- Oh, my gosh, guys!

293
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:52,794
So big!

294
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:54,786
So pretty!

295
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:58,379
Becca, Lindsey!

296
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,129
Look who's here!

297
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:05,138
Hi!

298
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,841
- No shit. You got the boat?
- Yup, I got the boat.

299
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,396
- Good for you, dude!
- Boom!

300
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:11,115
That's fuckin' awesome.
What you get, a dinghy?

301
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:12,208
Ah, shut up.

302
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:13,943
You gotta make sure
you have the essentials.

303
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,208
You got the life preservers?

304
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,052
Got that.

305
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,616
- You got a fire extinguisher?
- Got that.

306
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,927
You have a flare gun?

307
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,068
Ernngh!

308
00:24:20,552 --> 00:24:22,693
I knew you'd fuckin'
forget the flare gun.

309
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:29,645
You sure you don't
want anything to drink?

310
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:32,208
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- They're delicious.

311
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,591
Uh-huh, I'm sure, yeah.

312
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:39,200
You guys have a good
summer, so far?

313
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:41,209
Yeah, it's been great.

314
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:44,857
You good?

315
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,607
Yeah.

316
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:48,060
What?

317
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,294
I have a hard time just...

318
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,529
you know, talking.

319
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,216
Oh, I get that.

320
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:57,865
Yeah. No, I totally get that.

321
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,888
You guys, uh, want somethin'?

322
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,496
Got a full bar here.

323
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,857
No, all good. Water.

324
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,355
You want thirds, huh?

325
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,216
- Thank you.
- Okay.

326
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:09,216
Gotta get my wife
her medicine.

327
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,294
It's beautiful, isn't it?

328
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:13,433
Here you go.

329
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,521
Uh-uh.

330
00:25:14,857 --> 00:25:16,107
What do we say?

331
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:17,380
"I hate you?"

332
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:18,678
That works.

333
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:19,820
Yeah? Good.

334
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:22,836
Never stops.

335
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,797
I think about murdering
him sometimes.

336
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:28,109
- So nothing's changed, huh?
- Nope.

337
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,242
Ooh, actually...

338
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,086
A little something has changed.

339
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,437
Oh, my God.

340
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,281
Did you get something done?

341
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:41,070
Just, like, an itsy-bitsy little-
little thing.

342
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,383
Oh, God.

343
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,470
Well, you look just like
you did last year.

344
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:45,586
Oh, thank you.

345
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,125
Well, I mean, that's
the idea, you know.

346
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,460
Just a little bit
can go a long way.

347
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:51,367
Not that you need anything,

348
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:52,664
whore.

349
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,647
What was it?

350
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,951
Just a stupid tunnel.

351
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:13,294
Ugh, destroyed such baby shit.

352
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:23,641
Your brother's so weird.

353
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,516
He just has
a hard time focusing.

354
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,779
Are you going in the water?

355
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
No.

356
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:33,693
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

357
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:35,107
Hey, where are you going?

358
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,474
To the bathroom.

359
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:38,561
- Why don't you pee in the ocean?
- Why don't you pee in the ocean?

360
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:39,458
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

361
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:40,599
- Double jinx.
- Double jinx.

362
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:41,435
- Triple jinx.
- Triple jinx.

363
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,357
- Blackout.
- Blackout.

364
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:44,326
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

365
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:46,273
Did you ever wish
you'd kept dancing?

366
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:50,210
Sometimes, yeah.

367
00:26:50,663 --> 00:26:52,890
'Cause you were, like,
really good, right?

368
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,351
Yeah, well...

369
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:56,350
I peaked at 14.

370
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,069
Oh, I mean, didn't we all?

371
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,376
I think I could have been
a movie star.

372
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,462
If the girls hadn't been born
at exactly the wrong time.

373
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,056
I went to Stella Adler.

374
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:20,947
I was on two commercials
before I met Josh.

375
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:26,667
San Francisco was
a career killer.

376
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,222
Jesus! Watch it!

377
00:27:36,634 --> 00:27:37,821
Uck.

378
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:39,760
That's crazy.

379
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,103
Been having so many crazy
coincidences lately.

380
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:25,557
Jason!

381
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,314
- Jason!
- Jason!

382
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,455
- Where were you?
- I went to the bathroom.

383
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,431
No! You don't do that.

384
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:38,056
You don't run off
without telling me.

385
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:39,783
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

386
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,111
Okay, okay, we're all good.
We're good. All right.

387
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,112
I think we're gonna head out.

388
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,859
- Yeah.
- Okay?

389
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:03,667
You saw their new car, right?

390
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:05,615
He had to do it.

391
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,329
He just had to get that
thing to fuck with me, too.

392
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:09,836
That's mission accomplished.

393
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:11,907
Don't run inside!

394
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:19,688
Way to freak Mom out.

395
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:25,833
I'm gonna go say goodnight.

396
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:29,071
<i>11-11 tied in the 7th inning.</i>

397
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:34,287
You good?

398
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,299
I'm just gonna watch the
Giants highlights, okay?

399
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:42,799
I'll see you later
in the magic room.

400
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:45,830
- Night, night.
- Good night.

401
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:47,096
Phone off.

402
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,732
Mask off.

403
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:15,365
You thought I was dead.

404
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,740
Oh, no, I just...

405
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:22,279
I just didn't know
if you were lost, or

406
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:24,990
taken or...

407
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,756
By terrorists and perverts?

408
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:33,319
Stick with me.

409
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,139
I'll keep you safe, okay?

410
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,534
Look.

411
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,167
11:11.

412
00:30:58,238 --> 00:30:59,816
Bedtime.

413
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:29,127
Who's this?

414
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:38,843
I was thinking about getting
some fishing gear tomorrow.

415
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:42,741
Four rods, we could all go,
fish off the dock.

416
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:43,991
You know?

417
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:47,772
Of course,
there's the boat, too.

418
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:52,935
I'm just sayin',

419
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,014
if we could get out there
in open water...

420
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:58,256
I'm not trying to force anyone.

421
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:20,859
Hey.

422
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:24,773
Gabe, I wanna go.

423
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:27,380
Where you tryin' to go?

424
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,561
I can't be here, I...

425
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,936
It's too much.

426
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:33,725
You serious?

427
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:36,730
Being here, it, um...

428
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:43,269
It feels like
there's this, um...

429
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:47,589
black c-cloud just

430
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:51,120
hanging over me and, uh...

431
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:54,355
I don't feel like myself.

432
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:57,988
I think you look like yourself.

433
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:06,878
Okay, yeah.

434
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,819
When I was a kid,

435
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:28,835
I went to that boardwalk
with my parents.

436
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:31,726
I wandered off.

437
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,108
I don't know why, I just did.

438
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:37,296
I ended up in that
hall of mirrors.

439
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,851
There was another girl in there.

440
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:46,397
She looked like me.

441
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:50,155
Exactly like me.

442
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,552
You were in the hall of mirrors...

443
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:54,218
She wasn't a reflection.

444
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:56,265
She was real.

445
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,847
She was real.

446
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:03,382
Sh-She...

447
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,578
I ran as fast as I could.

448
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,894
My whole life, I've...

449
00:34:24,586 --> 00:34:28,297
I've thought that
she's a devil coming for me.

450
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:31,414
Okay, well, whatever happened

451
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:34,532
happened a-a long
time ago, right?

452
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,711
You know, how sometimes
things line up?

453
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:41,922
- Yeah.
- You know, like, coincidences?

454
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:45,552
Since we've been here,
they've been happening

455
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:48,014
more and more.

456
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,967
I think...

457
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:55,108
I feel like it means,
like, she's getting closer.

458
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:57,943
Who?

459
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,170
The mirror girl?

460
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,670
You don't believe me.

461
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,873
I-I-I do.

462
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,068
I do.

463
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,342
I'm processing, okay?

464
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:11,904
It's just...

465
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:15,068
I can't believe you

466
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:18,029
kept all this inside you
so long.

467
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:22,193
You know I'm here, right?

468
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,146
I'm pretty sure
I can kick your ass

469
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,779
so if she looks like
you, then...

470
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,803
Okay, bad joke.

471
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:36,420
All right, I'm sorry.
My bad.

472
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,420
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

473
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,131
Shit.

474
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,295
We lost power.

475
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,349
Perfect timing.

476
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:47,381
See, this is why Josh
has a backup generator.

477
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,420
Jesus!

478
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,818
Okay, we lost power,
go back to bed.

479
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,131
There's a family in our driveway.

480
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:59,880
There is not a family
in our driveway.

481
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,006
Huh.

482
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,568
Who is that?

483
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:10,576
It's a family.

484
00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:12,490
Y'all scared of a family?

485
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:15,267
The boogeyman's family

486
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,743
Okay, all right, enough-
enough of that.

487
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,159
Uh-uh.

488
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:20,949
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No.

489
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:22,824
What?

490
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:24,229
Zora, gimme your phone!

491
00:36:24,254 --> 00:36:25,582
- I'm not on it.
- Zora!

492
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:29,004
Is someone outside?

493
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,942
It's just a family standing outside.

494
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:34,254
It's probably the neighbors.

495
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:35,667
You're kidding me, right?

496
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:38,285
Hello, my name is Adelaide Wilson.

497
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,527
Are you seriously calling
911 right now?

498
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,485
Hurry up?
We lost power.

499
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,344
All right, sure, okay.

500
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,797
- Yes.
- You know what?

501
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,477
- What?
- I'm gonna fix this.

502
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:50,359
- No, we don't...
- I'll find out

503
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,093
- What?
- Who they are.

504
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:53,838
No, they haven't
but I know they're gonna...

505
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:56,093
Everything's gonna be fine.
Calm down, okay?

506
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:58,187
No, no, no, that's too long!

507
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,007
No! You don't understand.

508
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,506
How about we all
just try to keep calm?

509
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:05,585
- Gabe...
- Dad...

510
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,210
Keep our heads and everything's
gonna be all right.

511
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:10,210
Don't... w-w-wait, just one second.
Gabe!

512
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,432
Can't I have a vacation

513
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:23,136
and my whole family lost
their goddamn minds.

514
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:26,909
Hi.

515
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:28,995
Can I help you?

516
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:36,651
Okay.

517
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,010
If y'all out here
trying to scare people,

518
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:43,706
I think you picked the
wrong house for that.

519
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:48,682
Zora.

520
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:51,432
Put your shoes on.

521
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:58,026
Aight. I asked you nice.

522
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:01,643
Now, I need y'all
to get off my property.

523
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,697
Okay, let's call the cops.

524
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,221
I did.

525
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,940
They're 14 minutes away.

526
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,736
What? 14 minutes?

527
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,908
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

528
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:43,228
Okay, okay.

529
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:44,838
Jason, give me the bat.

530
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,190
What bat?

531
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,502
The baseball bat, the bat!
There's one in the corner.

532
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,588
- Here.
- Thank you.

533
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,479
- Gabe.
- All right, hold on.

534
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:53,690
- Let's just try this again.
- Gabe.

535
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,315
No, no, no, no, no.

536
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:57,869
All right.

537
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,775
- Gabe!
- I got this, I got this.

538
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:09,634
Now, I thought I already done
told y'all to get off my property!

539
00:39:09,736 --> 00:39:12,665
Okay? So if y'all wanna get crazy,

540
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:14,416
we can get crazy!

541
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:19,111
Now, the cops
are already on their way.

542
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,303
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

543
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,733
Hey!

544
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:43,399
They're going around.

545
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:44,961
Is the back door open?

546
00:39:45,094 --> 00:39:47,320
- Back door's open.
- Zora, no!

547
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:48,945
Gabe, Jason!

548
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:04,586
Now, I'm serious, man!

549
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:07,750
I will break your heads!

550
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,637
If I were you...

551
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:17,542
Gabe!

552
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:54,525
- The key!
- What?

553
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,821
- The hide-a-key!
- Hide-a-key?

554
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:59,415
Hide-a-what, shit!

555
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,614
Shit!

556
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:50,483
Oh, my God.

557
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:51,933
Just stay close.

558
00:41:52,732 --> 00:41:54,037
What's going on?

559
00:43:43,102 --> 00:43:44,274
What?

560
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:46,805
It's us.

561
00:43:57,508 --> 00:43:59,328
We don't have anything here.

562
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,828
- This is our summer home,
- Gabe.

563
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,086
We just got in today, so...

564
00:44:03,164 --> 00:44:04,446
Once

565
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:07,711
upon

566
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:11,602
a time,

567
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,693
there was a girl.

568
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:22,138
And the girl had

569
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:24,615
a shadow.

570
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,744
The two

571
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,010
were

572
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:32,346
connected.

573
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:35,518
Tethered together.

574
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:38,268
When the girl ate,

575
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,455
her food was given to her

576
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:42,791
warm

577
00:44:43,018 --> 00:44:44,596
and tasty.

578
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,459
But when the shadow was hungry,

579
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:50,146
she had to eat rabbit

580
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,435
raw

581
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:52,693
and bloody.

582
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:55,881
On Christmas,

583
00:44:56,497 --> 00:45:00,465
the girl received wonderful toys.

584
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:03,138
Soft and cushy.

585
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:07,899
But the shadow's toys
were so sharp and cold.

586
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:12,103
They'd slice through her fingers
when she tried to play with them.

587
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,798
The girl

588
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:17,493
met a handsome prince

589
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,386
and fell in love.

590
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:21,112
But the shadow,

591
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,229
at that same time,

592
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:26,402
met Abraham.

593
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:30,626
It didn't matter
if she loved him or not.

594
00:45:31,316 --> 00:45:35,324
He was tethered to the
girl's prince, after all.

595
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:40,418
Then, the girl
had her first child.

596
00:45:40,832 --> 00:45:43,098
A beautiful baby girl.

597
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,199
But the shadow

598
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,762
she gave birth to
a little monster.

599
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:53,175
Umbrae was born laughing.

600
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:56,082
The girl had a second child.

601
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,847
A boy this time.

602
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:00,043
They had to cut her open

603
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:03,011
and take him from her belly.

604
00:46:03,122 --> 00:46:06,450
The shadow had to do it all

605
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:09,114
by itself.

606
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:12,091
She named him Pluto.

607
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:15,160
He was born to love fire.

608
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:18,176
So you see, the shadow

609
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:20,192
hated the girl

610
00:46:20,317 --> 00:46:22,005
so much

611
00:46:22,098 --> 00:46:23,614
for so long.

612
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:26,119
Until one day,

613
00:46:26,237 --> 00:46:28,502
the shadow realized

614
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:31,635
she was being tested

615
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:33,581
by God.

616
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,767
Excuse me.

617
00:46:43,282 --> 00:46:44,532
Excuse me.

618
00:46:46,993 --> 00:46:48,372
What do you want?

619
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:50,587
You could have my wallet.

620
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,571
You could have the car.

621
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:54,189
Gabe.

622
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:00,798
You could have the boat,
for all I care.

623
00:47:01,423 --> 00:47:03,361
Nobody wants the boat, Dad.

624
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,041
How 'bout this?

625
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:08,400
You take me to the ATM...

626
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:19,439
What are you people?

627
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:27,432
We're Americans.

628
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:42,184
Tether yourself to the table.

629
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:45,708
Addie, don't do it.

630
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:47,629
Maybe I should cut

631
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:49,895
something off of you.

632
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:54,725
It's... It's okay.

633
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,897
Don't hurt my children.

634
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,639
Yo.

635
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:05,954
Hey, hey, hey! No!

636
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:08,190
Stop, please.

637
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:09,574
Get off me, man!

638
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:14,330
- Gabe!
- Daddy!

639
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,041
Please, please, please!
Stop!

640
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,393
Stop, please!

641
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:18,916
Gabe!

642
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:22,065
Wait! Wait!

643
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,541
Okay.

644
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:27,807
Okay.

645
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:35,735
Mom.

646
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,704
Little girl.

647
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,681
Run!

648
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:43,016
Go.

649
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:16,075
You want me, right?

650
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:25,551
He's not going.

651
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:26,864
Careful.

652
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:29,708
He has a te-emper.

653
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,965
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not.

654
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:04,402
Oh, shit.

655
00:51:10,043 --> 00:51:11,051
Okay.

656
00:51:12,847 --> 00:51:14,166
Don't be scared.

657
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:15,777
Look at me.

658
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:17,785
You're gonna be okay.

659
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,824
Show him one of your tricks.

660
00:51:25,535 --> 00:51:26,699
Okay.

661
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:31,348
Go play, boys.

662
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:39,011
Don't burn our house down.

663
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,275
Stop.

664
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:06,533
Please, stop.

665
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:15,553
Stop it!

666
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:20,521
Please, no, no!

667
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,698
What the fuck?

668
00:54:41,854 --> 00:54:43,339
Get off my car!

669
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:48,432
Come here!

670
00:54:48,987 --> 00:54:51,589
Come... goddammit,
get your ass over here!

671
00:54:57,198 --> 00:54:58,768
I said, come here.

672
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,690
Kid, I'm talkin' to you.

673
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:10,933
What do you want?

674
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:21,308
What?

675
00:55:28,213 --> 00:55:29,744
What do we want?

676
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:33,697
We want

677
00:55:33,822 --> 00:55:36,791
to take our time.

678
00:55:38,478 --> 00:55:40,791
We've been waiting for this day

679
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,330
for so long!

680
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:47,924
I call it

681
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:52,174
the Untethering.

682
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:15,970
That's yours.

683
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,348
It hangs to the left.

684
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,669
It hangs to the goddamn left.

685
01:01:26,947 --> 01:01:28,228
Jason?

686
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:49,405
Jason?

687
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,625
Come here.

688
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:20,795
It's your dad! Run!

689
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:24,732
Hey!

690
01:02:35,703 --> 01:02:37,562
Come on, come on, come on.

691
01:02:41,722 --> 01:02:44,456
Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go!

692
01:03:29,126 --> 01:03:31,384
Josh, what was that?

693
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,322
What?

694
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:34,009
I heard something outside.

695
01:03:35,175 --> 01:03:36,316
Okay.

696
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:38,339
Rustling.

697
01:03:38,472 --> 01:03:39,870
Walking, like a person.

698
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,901
There's a person walking
outside our fucking house.

699
01:03:41,925 --> 01:03:43,925
Could be a squirrel.
I don't know.

700
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,589
Would you please
get up and look?

701
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:48,253
I'm busy. I'm...

702
01:03:48,722 --> 01:03:49,722
I'm busy.

703
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:51,285
So.

704
01:03:53,823 --> 01:03:56,386
Maybe it's a-a pizza guy.
Maybe the girls ordered pizza.

705
01:03:56,448 --> 01:03:58,558
Get up and take a look,
I'm scared.

706
01:03:58,597 --> 01:04:00,636
Aw, I don't want to.
I wanna stay down here.

707
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:02,041
I wanna just stay in my cozy spot.

708
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:03,144
Get up and look.

709
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:04,425
Jesus Christ.

710
01:04:04,472 --> 01:04:06,535
Hey, uh, Ophelia, lights up.

711
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:08,098
<i>Lights up.</i>

712
01:04:08,856 --> 01:04:11,466
I think I heard the backup
generator go on, too.

713
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:12,864
What do you know about
the backup generator?

714
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:15,372
Can you stop being an asshole
for two seconds? Just look.

715
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,722
All right, I'm lookin'.

716
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:18,550
With my binoculars.

717
01:04:18,831 --> 01:04:20,433
I see nothing.

718
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,128
I see beautiful stars.

719
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:23,145
Are you really looking?

720
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,388
Yeah, I'm looking.

721
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:27,356
Oh, shit, no. Yeah, I...

722
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:28,341
There's somethin' out there.

723
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,371
Don't fuck with me, Josh.

724
01:04:29,396 --> 01:04:30,629
I'm not fucking with you.
I'm serious.

725
01:04:30,653 --> 01:04:31,608
There's something out there.

726
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:33,044
Look. Look behind the car.

727
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,234
Where? I don't see it.

728
01:04:35,273 --> 01:04:36,757
- By the car! Look.
- I can't...

729
01:04:37,093 --> 01:04:38,295
Ho, shit!

730
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,500

01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:04,802
<i>Here, we see a man
wearing red, who...</i>

901
01:17:05,823 --> 01:17:07,152
Okay, this...

902
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:09,854
<i>This seems to be a group
of individuals</i>

903
01:17:09,879 --> 01:17:12,605
<i>engaged in some sort
of demonstration,</i>

904
01:17:12,902 --> 01:17:14,214
<i>protest...</i>

905
01:17:14,952 --> 01:17:16,413
<i>It's not clear at this time</i>

906
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:18,896
<i>if or how these people are
connected to the attacks.</i>

907
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:20,069
What is that?

908
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:22,085
<i>They're forming what looks
like a human chain.</i>

909
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:23,401
What are they doing?

910
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:24,625
I don't know

911
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:27,265
but that would take a
shitload of coordination.

912
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:32,093
<i>Obviously, if you have children
watching this right now,</i>

913
01:17:32,118 --> 01:17:33,462
<i>to turn them away.</i>

914
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:35,735
<i>Not sure what's about to happen.</i>

915
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:40,899
We have to go.

916
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:42,595
What? You're joking, right?

917
01:17:42,665 --> 01:17:44,681
Zora, Jason, help your father.

918
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:46,642
She's tripping.
Where would we go?

919
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:48,478
- The police, right?
- No.

920
01:17:49,321 --> 01:17:50,961
We need to move and keep moving.

921
01:17:50,986 --> 01:17:52,048
We take the coast.

922
01:17:52,073 --> 01:17:53,110
We go to Mexico.

923
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:54,235
Mexico?

924
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:55,431
Okay.

925
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:58,056
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

926
01:17:58,493 --> 01:18:00,423
We got everything we need here.

927
01:18:00,517 --> 01:18:02,523
Food, water, backup generator.

928
01:18:02,548 --> 01:18:04,563
We're safe here as
we're gonna be anywhere.

929
01:18:04,588 --> 01:18:07,259
Tell that to Josh and Kitty.
They're right here.

930
01:18:09,868 --> 01:18:11,095
You're scaring the kids.

931
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:12,226
- Too late.
- Too late.

932
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:13,782
They think like us.

933
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:15,368
They know where we are.

934
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:17,892
They won't stop
until they kill us.

935
01:18:17,978 --> 01:18:19,259
Or we kill them.

936
01:18:19,368 --> 01:18:21,259
Then, let's make some
traps or somethin',

937
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:23,048
like some Home Alone type stuff.

938
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:24,071
That way, if she comes...

939
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:26,478
Tell me you did not just
reference Home Alone.

940
01:18:26,517 --> 01:18:27,712
You know what I'm talkin' about.

941
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,626
Gabe,

942
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,275
they've been planning this.

943
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,316
They have the upper hand.

944
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,081
This is the time to run,

945
01:18:34,106 --> 01:18:37,222
not to be sprinkling Micro
Machines on the floor.

946
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:41,456
- What are Micro Machines?
- What's Home Alone?

947
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:44,212
We're not going anywhere.
And that's final.

948
01:18:44,237 --> 01:18:47,307
You don't get to make
the decisions anymore!

949
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:55,292
So,

950
01:18:56,019 --> 01:18:58,628
does this mean we get their car?

951
01:19:01,823 --> 01:19:04,542
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

952
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:06,808
Who's got the keys?

953
01:20:40,677 --> 01:20:42,130
Get in the car, get in the car.

954
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:46,232
- I'm driving.
- No way.

955
01:20:46,286 --> 01:20:47,396
I told her, no.

956
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:49,589
Dad's leg is messed up.
You're handcuffed.

957
01:20:49,614 --> 01:20:51,411
It's not safe. I'm driving.

958
01:20:51,444 --> 01:20:52,827
- Zora!
- No.

959
01:20:52,913 --> 01:20:54,639
I have the highest
kill count in the family.

960
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:56,405
You don't have the
highest kill count.

961
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,069
I killed both twins.

962
01:20:58,132 --> 01:20:59,532
Wrong.
I just killed the second one.

963
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:00,765
I killed Kitty.

964
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,491
So that's one, one, one,
and two.

965
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,629
I killed two.
I killed myself and Josh, so.

966
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:07,567
It doesn't matter.

967
01:21:07,592 --> 01:21:09,888
- Zora, get in the back.
- Look!

968
01:21:09,951 --> 01:21:11,514
Oh, shit, put the windows
up, put the windows up,

969
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:12,677
put the windows up!

970
01:21:27,373 --> 01:21:28,506
Okay,

971
01:21:28,623 --> 01:21:30,069
you're gonna want to

972
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:31,787
back up.

973
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:35,521
Buckle up.

974
01:21:35,686 --> 01:21:36,702
Huh?

975
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:42,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

976
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,522
Where is she?
Did I get her?

977
01:21:58,232 --> 01:21:59,482
She's there! She's there!

978
01:21:59,802 --> 01:22:00,810
Jesus!

979
01:22:25,519 --> 01:22:26,519
Zora!

980
01:22:28,516 --> 01:22:29,583
Careful.

981
01:22:32,952 --> 01:22:34,444
You're going too fast!

982
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:41,958
She's dead now, right?

983
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:48,089
What are you doing?

984
01:22:48,144 --> 01:22:49,667
- Mom!
- Where's she going?

985
01:22:49,753 --> 01:22:51,050
And she left.

986
01:22:51,511 --> 01:22:52,761
Your mom left the car.

987
01:25:25,965 --> 01:25:27,005
Whoa.

988
01:25:28,785 --> 01:25:29,910
Is that our car?

989
01:25:31,245 --> 01:25:32,682
It's followed who looks like me.

990
01:25:34,778 --> 01:25:35,801
Shit.

991
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:58,411
Stay in the car.
Lock the doors.

992
01:26:30,623 --> 01:26:31,881
What is she doing?

993
01:26:54,259 --> 01:26:55,282
It's a trap.

994
01:26:57,446 --> 01:26:58,454
Get out!

995
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:21,735
Please.

996
01:27:35,869 --> 01:27:36,869
No.

997
01:27:52,092 --> 01:27:53,209
No!

998
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,773
Jason!

999
01:28:22,313 --> 01:28:23,313
Jason?

1000
01:28:24,016 --> 01:28:25,079
Jason!

1001
01:28:27,773 --> 01:28:28,819
Jason!

1002
01:28:30,145 --> 01:28:31,254
No!

1003
01:28:31,878 --> 01:28:33,073
Adelaide!

1004
01:33:35,772 --> 01:33:36,772
Here.

1005
01:33:37,327 --> 01:33:38,600
What do we got here?

1006
01:33:38,874 --> 01:33:40,694
Probably got bandages and stuff.

1007
01:33:43,811 --> 01:33:45,217
Your mom knows what to do.

1008
01:33:54,436 --> 01:33:55,475
Look.

1009
01:33:59,897 --> 01:34:00,991
It's the line.

1010
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:07,960
Looks like some kind of
fucked up performance art.

1011
01:34:36,312 --> 01:34:37,625
Where is he?

1012
01:34:42,351 --> 01:34:44,469
How it must have been

1013
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,586
to grow up with a sky.

1014
01:34:47,719 --> 01:34:51,492
To feel the sun,
the wind, the trees.

1015
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:54,617
But your people
took it for granted.

1016
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:57,570
We're human too, you know.

1017
01:34:58,388 --> 01:34:59,734
Lives.

1018
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:03,669
Gave them hands, blood.

1019
01:35:05,387 --> 01:35:07,145
Exactly like you.

1020
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:11,156
And yet,

1021
01:35:12,064 --> 01:35:15,156
it was humans

1022
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,477
that built this place.

1023
01:35:18,219 --> 01:35:19,328
I believe

1024
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:22,945
they figured out how to
make a copy of the body

1025
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:24,580
but not the soul.

1026
01:35:24,826 --> 01:35:28,115
The soul remains one
shared by two.

1027
01:35:28,966 --> 01:35:31,427
They created the Tethered

1028
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:34,606
so they could use them to
control the ones above.

1029
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:37,740
Like puppets.

1030
01:35:39,622 --> 01:35:41,028
But they failed

1031
01:35:41,122 --> 01:35:43,622
and they upended the Tethered.

1032
01:35:44,294 --> 01:35:45,818
For generations,

1033
01:35:45,919 --> 01:35:48,997
the Tethered continued
without interactions.

1034
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:52,529
They all went mad down here.

1035
01:35:56,618 --> 01:35:57,813
And then

1036
01:35:59,349 --> 01:36:01,005
there was Addie.

1037
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:04,580
Put some meat on that one.

1038
01:36:04,605 --> 01:36:06,908
Yeah, I guess I missed
my chance to go pro.

1039
01:36:07,103 --> 01:36:08,596
You remember?

1040
01:36:15,016 --> 01:36:17,329
We were born special.

1041
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,150
I want number 11.

1042
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:21,681
Yeah?

1043
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:08,166
Addie, you wanna try it?

1044
01:37:32,941 --> 01:37:36,980
God brought us
together that night.

1045
01:38:24,433 --> 01:38:27,753
I never stopped
thinking about you.

1046
01:38:30,171 --> 01:38:32,163
How things could have been.

1047
01:38:33,014 --> 01:38:35,819
How you could have
taken me with you.

1048
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,649
Years after we met,

1049
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:45,735
the miracle of life.

1050
01:38:48,853 --> 01:38:50,946
That's when I saw God.

1051
01:38:51,915 --> 01:38:54,532
And He showed me my path.

1052
01:38:55,657 --> 01:38:57,743
You felt it, too.

1053
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:02,548
The end of our dance.

1054
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:06,071
The Tethered saw
that I was different.

1055
01:39:07,173 --> 01:39:09,821
That I would deliver
them from this misery.

1056
01:39:10,603 --> 01:39:12,985
I found my faith.

1057
01:39:13,665 --> 01:39:16,892
And I began to prepare.

1058
01:39:18,368 --> 01:39:21,189
It took years to plan.

1059
01:39:26,806 --> 01:39:29,735
Everything had to be perfect.

1060
01:39:33,309 --> 01:39:35,817
I didn't just need to kill you.

1061
01:39:36,215 --> 01:39:38,621
I needed to make a statement

1062
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:41,845
that the whole world would see.

1063
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:48,025
It's our time now.

1064
01:39:48,509 --> 01:39:51,103
Our time up there.

1065
01:40:03,298 --> 01:40:04,696
And to think,

1066
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:07,564
if it weren't for you,

1067
01:40:10,361 --> 01:40:13,306
I never would've danced at all.

1068
01:45:25,781 --> 01:45:27,022
My baby!

1069
01:45:27,317 --> 01:45:28,767
My baby!

1070
01:45:29,395 --> 01:45:30,559
Oh, God.

1071
01:45:35,798 --> 01:45:37,039
Look, look.

1072
01:45:46,982 --> 01:45:48,492
They're all gone now.

1073
01:45:52,068 --> 01:45:53,587
They can't hurt you.

1074
01:45:55,289 --> 01:45:56,495
You understand?

1075
01:46:04,192 --> 01:46:06,740
Everything's gonna be
like it was before.

1076
01:47:24,101 --> 01:47:25,472
She wasn't in 'Nam.

1077
01:47:25,724 --> 01:47:27,261
Okay, she got lost.

1078
01:47:27,476 --> 01:47:28,508
For 15 minutes, that's...

1079
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:29,812
That could be very scary.

1080
01:47:29,837 --> 01:47:31,530
You don't know what
happened to her.

1081
01:47:31,762 --> 01:47:33,984
- Anything coulda happened to her.
- Okay, okay.

1082
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:36,493
So, h-how? How do we
get her to talk?

1083
01:47:37,465 --> 01:47:39,349
Encourage her to draw,

01:47:39,523 --> 01:47:41,285
to write, to dance.

Yeah. Yeah.

- Look at you.

Look at you.

01:49:06,948 --> 01:49:09,182
It's not my fault she...
Look at me. Look at you.
