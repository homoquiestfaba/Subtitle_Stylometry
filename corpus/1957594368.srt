Please to hold very still.

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,430
Nikita, I thought
 you were sleeping.

4
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,170
I don't think so.

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,640
But I'm sure my comrades will be
 very interesting to learn what

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,720
you have been up to in here.

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,100

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,730
You are a spy,
 a very good one.

9
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,840
There will be a big
 reward for your capture.

10
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,770
What's the rush?

00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,140
You caught me with
 my pants down.

00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,520
You're making
 minimum wage, playing

00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,640
the lottery with the
 chance to win toilet paper.

14
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,040
So?

15
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,660
So why don't you let me show
 you the power of capitalism?

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,570
Mm-hmm.

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,020
No.

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,900
No tricks.

23
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,480
Just treats.

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,030
And it all starts
 with an open hand.

25
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,790
Now you're sleeping.

26
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,440
Come in, Agent Tania.

27
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,880
I understand your mission
 was a success, as usual.

28
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,160
I believe that the film
 turned out very well.

29
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,740
However, it wasn't easy to get.

30
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,560
That's why we put our
 best agent on the job.

31
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,990
Mr. Whately, you flatter me.

32
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,080
I mean to.

33
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,760
You all rested now?

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,460
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,920
I am feeling back to
 my old self again.

36
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,620
Good.

37
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,140
Agent, I have need of
 your services again.

38
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,600
Right here on
 top of the desk OK?

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Not those services, agent.

40
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,110
Right, sir.

41
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,480
Sorry.

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,290
Have you ever heard of
 sensible satellite radio?

All music and
 talk all the time?

44
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,960
Exactly.

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,350
Well, there's one
 special channel, 6969,

46
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,840
which is reserved for
 international communications

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,920
between our organization,
 the FBI, CIA, all in code,

48
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,570
of course.

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,490
Of course.

BIKINI is represented by
 the "Surf's Up Radio Hour."

51
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,540
Most of our
 information is filtered

52
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,770
through these channels.

53
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,770
Someone somewhere is
 jamming that signal.

54
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,560
We don't think they've
 broken our code yet.

55
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,790
They are stopping our
 agencies from communicating

You know, I never
 realized that they

60
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,930
were using it for top-secret
 communications, though.

61
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,040
That's how we first learned
 of your successes in Moscow.

Oh.

I'm impressed.

64
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,490
I need to know who's
 jamming our signal.

We have an informant, a
 stripper named Patty Mercury.

We think you two should
 get on well together.

If she gives you any leads, play
 it through, and get back to me

 take this lying down.

 let you down, sir.

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,430
You never have, agent.

 something in store--

That's right.

95
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,430
So Whately told me that
 you had some information

96
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,310
you wanted to share with me.

97
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,050
Sometimes I do
 private shows, the kind

98
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm sure I don't need to explain
 to you, and some of our clients

99
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,730
are very important
 people, the kind

100
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,130
that you would never expect.

101
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:01,640
That's exactly the kind of
 man or woman I'm interested in.

102
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,340
Well, not too long
 ago, I was entertaining

103
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,270
this very wealthy man
 named Randolph Davis.

104
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,960
Right in the middle of a
 little, his cell phone rings,

105
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,530
and the guy takes the call.

106
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,520
What?

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,360
Anyway, the phone call
 sounded extremely suspicious.

108
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,290
I mean, it's not like I could
 talk right then or anything,

109
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,550
but I could certainly hear.

110
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,280
So when I got home,
 I called the cops,

111
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,630
and they referred
 me to Mr. Whately

112
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,310
and your BIKINI organization.

113
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,490
You know, Patty, that
 was very patriotic of you.

114
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:39,670
And Whately asked me to hear you
 out, and I believe your story.

115
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,740
I am telling you the truth.

116
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,700
You need to check this guy out.

117
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,350
Can you help me with this?

118
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,710
Sure.

119
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,080
You know, Patty, I really need
 Randolph's address and phone

number.

121
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,770
If I gave it to you,
 he would have me killed.

122
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,300
Well, I need it now.

123
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,770
Isn't there some other
 way you can get it?

124
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,300
Like, the phone book maybe?

125
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,130
Patty, I know that you
 want to give it to me.

126
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,590
Don't be afraid.

127
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,660
I need it, and I need it now.

128
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,050
You think someone
 killed Patty Mercury

129
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,180
because she was about to talk?

130
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,570
Well, that or she
 was about to orgasm.

Interesting.

132
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,800
I read the contents of this
 dart analyzed down at the lab,

133
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,240
and it turns out it
 contains deadly poison.

134
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,370
I'm not bit surprised.

135
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,860
Deadly in an
 Asiatic sort of way.

136
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,750
It's an extract of
 the mariposa lupine

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,460
plant, which only
 grows in the mountains

138
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,590
of the northern Himalayas.

139
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,890
Exotic and dangerous.

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,770
Yes.

141
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,470
And it is rarely, if ever,
 used on this continent.

142
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,210
Well, that narrows
 it down a little.

143
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,420
It narrows it down a lot.

00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,260

 indulging in total pleasure.

 pleasure in every indulgence.

Thank you, sir.

I'm assuming you hooked
 up with Randolph Davis?

 he got the better end of it.

Hardly.

364
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,500
You want her to stay here?

365
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,040
You are one of BIKINI's top
 agents, and you are both girls.

366
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,080
Duh.

367
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,630
You are so not getting
 back into my good graces.

368
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,410
Come on.

369
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,300
This is important.

370
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,600
[DOORBELL]

371
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,640
There she is.

372
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,000
Just meet her before you
 rule this out entirely.

373
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,390
OK, fine.

374
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,840
But you're not getting
 into my pants today, Mark.

375
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,970
Please.

376
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,400
Just meet her, say hello.

377
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,230
We'll take it from there.

378
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,270
Hey, Samantha.

379
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,970
Come on in.

380
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,170
Hi, Mark.

381
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,080
Am I early?

382
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,870
No, not at all.

383
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,130
Don't worry about it.

384
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,470
This is Tania.

385
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,940
This is her house.

386
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,640
Hello.

387
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,340
Hi.

388
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,430
I'm Samantha.

389
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,660
Yeah, I know.

390
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,820
Wow.

391
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,520
You know what?

392
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,580
You can just go that way.

393
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,280
OK.

394
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,640
You are so close to getting
 into my pants today.

395
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,510
I thought you might like her.

396
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,290
Wow.

397
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,930
There's a lot to lick--

398
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,390
I mean, like.

399
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,090
Hoo.

400
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,020
So tell me about your
 problem, Samantha.

401
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,110
Well, lately, I haven't
 been having any trouble.

402
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,360
But then the notes
 started coming.

403
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,900
You're dead meat, bitch.

404
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,390
And, I'm going to
 get you, sucker.

405
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,030
And then the phone calls.

406
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,680
Is your refrigerator running?

407
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,780
Better catch it.

408
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,330
Do you have Prince
 Albert in a can?

409
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,490
Better let him out.

410
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,940
Before long, it
 felt like someone

411
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,640
was staring at me, watching me.

412
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,860
I could hear every breath
 and his burning eyes burning

413
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,830
into my naked flesh.

414
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,910
What?

415
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,010
It's my job to watch her.

416
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,930
It's for her good.

417
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,810
Sure it is.

418
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,940
Please, go on.

419
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,430
The sensation
 was the strongest

420
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,010
whenever I took my clothes off.

421
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,890
And I'm a sexaholic, so I take
 my clothes off an awful lot.

422
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,640
Really?

423
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,600
Are you having these
 strange feelings now?

424
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,670
No, not right now.

425
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,820
I feel pretty safe and secure.

426
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,880
Hm, interesting.

427
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,850
Maybe you should remove
 a piece of clothing

428
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,250
and then we'll see how you feel.

429
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,950
OK.

430
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,630
How's that?

431
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,840
I feel like someone's
 staring at me.

432
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,780
Is that so?

433
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,710
You know, maybe if
 you take the bra off,

434
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,450
we'll see what happens.

435
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,580
OK, if you think it'd help.

436
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,160
Oh, I definitely
 think it'll help.

437
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,430
That's really hot.

438
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,130
Yeah.

439
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,600
Now I'm starting to
 feel like strange eyes are

440
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,300
burning into me.

441
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,660
Maybe I should take off
 the skirt to make sure.

442
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,720
Ooh.

443
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,420
OK.

444
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,160
Yeah, the meter's
 really [INAUDIBLE] now.

445
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,070
You said something
 about being a sexaholic?

446
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,640
Oh, I can't get enough.

447
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,720
And what does
 that mean, exactly?

448
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,270
It means they want to go
 down on you both right now.

449
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,320
Oh, I hope you saved
 room for dessert.

450
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,400
Oh, I did.

451
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,350
FAY WONG: You're
 all having fun now,

452
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,060
thinking in your tiny
 minds that you're

453
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,390
far beyond Fay Wong's reach.

454
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,700
Little do you know
 that even now,

455
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,190
Mong Lee's plotting the end
 to your meaningless lives.

456
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,150
Bask now in your
 earthly pleasures,

457
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,040
for soon your torment
 will only delight me.

458
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,460
So then it's agreed.

459
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,370
Samantha is going to stay
 in your protective custody.

460
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,090
That's right.

461
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,260
Although I don't
 know how safe that is.

462
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,090
But at least until the CIA can
 assign a new bodyguard for her.

463
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,390
Well, that all
 depends on Whately.

464
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,110
But in the meantime,
 yes, it's OK

465
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,540
if she camps out at my place.

466
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,740
Good.

467
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,250
But I don't want to get
 into an international incident

468
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,330
over this.

469
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,450
We both know that
 BIKINI and the CIA

470
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,090
aren't exactly
 company bedfellows,

471
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,660
and I don't know how
 Whately is going to react.

472
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,960
Really.

473
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,780
I have gone over
 all the fine details

474
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,490
and have looked deep into this.

475
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,900
I'm afraid that such
 a thing is not possible.

476
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,620
But you haven't
 even heard us out yet.

477
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,860
MR. WHATELY: I don't need to.

478
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,650
Tania has a date
 with an airplane.

479
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,240
She's on her way to Asia,
 and I wouldn't trust

480
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,640
this mission to anyone but her.

481
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,680
No offense to the
 CIA, of course.

482
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
Noted.

483
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,090
I've already heard about
 your little babysitting job.

484
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,840
Tania's destiny lies in the
 mountains of northern China.

485
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,850
That will be all.

486
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Whately.

487
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
No need to apologize.

488
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,390
I understand she
 was quite a looker.

489
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,010
Oh, yes, she was.

490
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,180
Have a successful journey.

491
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,950
Report to me when you get back.

492
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,780
Yes, sir.

494
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,240
Hello.

495
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,300
May I help you?

496
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,110
Is the lady of the house in?

497
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,210
No, she's not in right
 now, and I'm just the guest.

498
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,720
Perhaps I may interest
 you in fine hairbrushes,

499
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,850
hairbrushes for
 every type of hair,

500
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,120
fine hairbrushes for
 every kind of occasion.

501
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,880
Really?

502
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,640
A traveling brush salesman.

503
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,830
Oh, please, come in.

504
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,990
Well, you know, I've been
 brushing my hair every day,

505
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:31,380
sometimes more, and I thought,
 wouldn't it be a super idea

506
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,280
if somebody came up to the door
 with a vast variety of brushes

507
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,410
to sell to people.

508
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,140
And here you are.

509
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,000
Please, if just show a
 lady fine brushes, perhaps

510
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,150
she find something she like.

Do you come in?

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,710
Hold on.

518
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,210
This is Fay Wong.

519
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,680
I have disabled the

little difficulty.

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,500
What are your instructions?

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,050
Do you have Samantha
 Rhinehart in your possession?

523
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,830
Oh, that's affirmative.

524
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,840
Excellent.

525
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,510
She will make a
 beautiful hostage.

526
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,130
Bring her to me.

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,890
Leave them.

529
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,140
The shame of having
 been defeated so easily

530
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,030
will send a message
 to others who seek

531
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,550

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,740

 that it be prudent for us to get
