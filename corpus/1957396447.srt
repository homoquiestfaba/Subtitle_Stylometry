170
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,541
I got a prime suspect. Macon Bewley.

171
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,541
Well, he's too dumb
not to get caught, so win-win.

177
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,500
No way Jackson's parents
wanna live in that house

178
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,333
on that farm
where their… where their kid was killed

179
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,166
any longer than they have to, right?

180
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,833
Who else wants that farm
more than Skipper Sandford,

181
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,958
the land baron of Osborne?

00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,125
Sorry. Thanks.

188

189
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,916

190
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,541

I guess, officially.

191
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,083

192
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,166
It's not a country club, Caleb.

193
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,541
I'm Makani.

194
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,208
That's Rodrigo,

195
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,458
Zach,

196
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,500
and Alex. She's our bitch-in-residence.

197
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,625
- Oh! Thank you.
- [Makani] Mm-hmm.

198
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,708
- [girl 2] My fellow seniors.
- You think I'm bad?

199
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,458
[girl 2] If may have
your attention, please.

200
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,208
Thank you.

201
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,333
I mean, what can one say
in the wake of such sadness?

202
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,458
Yet as your student council president,

203
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,041
I feel it's imperative
that I provide a beacon,

204
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:48,041
a kind of guiding light
in these dark and trying times.

205
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:53,000
So, I'd like to read an excerpt
from my admission essay to Cornell.

206
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,583
It's about oppression.

207
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:59,000
Princess Diana of Wales once said,
in her infinite wisdom,

208
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,958
that, "The greatest problem
in the world today is intolerance."

209
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,458
Did bitch just quote a princess
instead of someone actually oppressed?

210
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,208
We have a student here at my school

211
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,875
who is an outer space enthusiast,

212
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,416
but that's not the only thing
about this student that's alien.

213
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,250
His name, or her name,

214
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,583
depending on the day, is Darby.

215
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,416
Born Justine Darby, this student
showed me the meaning of courage

216
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,041
when, at age 11, she came out
to our school as she, he, and they,

217
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,083
and now every day in my mind,

218
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,250
I applaud her, him, and them.

219
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,875

[mouthing]

221
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,291
[girl 2] Jackson's video
and his death were hateful,

222
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,208
and the only way to respond to hate…

223
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,041
Is with love.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,583
We love all versions of you, Darby, okay?

225
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,500
Like we love all versions of Caleb.

226
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,958
So please, guys,

227
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,500
let's celebrate that love tomorrow
at the memorial at Holy Trinity.

You know that?

- I will cut you.
- [laughs]

233

- Or if the killer maybe killed Katie.

234
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,500
And you just said that. And I liked it.

[Zach] I get it. It makes sense.

722
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:38,166
You think that my father
is this festering pustule

723
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,208
disguised as a God-fearing pillar
of the community.

724
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,458
He buys up your families' land
for pennies on the dollar.

725

And for what?

726
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:51,583
Just so he can grow his 30,000-plus
acre corporate empire of shit!

727
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,041
- Fuck that shit!
- [girl] Yeah.

728
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,833

731
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,041
…and included the tenth largest
Nazi memorabilia collection

732
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,333

733
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,083
[boy 3] That's fucked up.

734
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,375
A shocking amount of which

735
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,958
I have converted

736
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:21,250

737
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,791

- [boy 4] Of course!

738

739
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,791

- So, allow me to propose a toast.

I'm at her house right now. Makani?

1043
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,875
Your grandma called. Are you... Jesus!

1044
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,791
Yeah, my friend's been attacked.
1412 Prescott! Hurry!

1046
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:12,750
You were right.

1047
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:15,291

1048
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:16,916
They're all gonna know.

1049

Hey, baby.

1055

What?

1056
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,125
He was there.

1057
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,375
Gam, he was there. He was there.

1058
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,708
They got him, sweetie.

1059
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:00,500

- You're safe.

1060
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,083
[Gam] It's okay.

1061
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:03,541
You're okay.

1062
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:05,333
We're all here.

1063
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:10,041
Did he text everyone?

1064
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,125
[Darby] I stopped reading.

1065
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:17,458
Thought you'd maybe like us
to hear it, you know, from you.

1066
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,375
I'm gonna get a coffee.

1067
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:24,666

Okay, bitches. You think
you got what it takes to win State?

1071
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:49,750
'Cause I don't see shit.

1075
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:02,416
- Hold up. These girls kidnapped you?
- These were your friends?

1076
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,541
Sometimes friends, I don't know.

1077
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:09,541
They were seniors.
It was my first year on varsity.

1078
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,083
- Varsity what?
- You played sports?

1079

[gasps, screams]

1089
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,666
I just…

1090
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,625
Pushed.

1091
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:55,583
Jasmine survived, but there were burns.

1092
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,000
Her face was, um…

1093
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:06,083
I got charged and went to trial.

1094
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:11,083
Even after I was acquitted,
I still got threats

1095
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:12,958
daily.

1096
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,208
My parents blamed each other.

1097
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:21,250
[scoffs] They'd been looking
for a reason to break up anyway.

1098
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:30,166
I was so ashamed of myself.

1099
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,833
So I moved here.

1100
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:39,500
Took my mom's maiden name and just…

1101
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:43,375
[sighs] …tried to become
a different person.

1102
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:44,833
You <i>are</i> a different person.

1103
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,833
I've never met
the person you're talking about.

1104
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:52,083
You bring me doughnuts
because you know they soothe me.

1105
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:56,916
You proofread my essays.
You stand up for me in public.

1106
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,583
That's who you are.

1107
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:03,125
I mean, you gave Ollie Larsson
the benefit of the doubt.

1108
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,541
And he's a murderer.

1109
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,750
Yeah, you gave a fucking murderer
the chance to show he's decent.

1110
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,416
- To no more secrets between friends.
- [chuckles]

1111
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,708
It's a fucking hospital, Zach!
Wait till we get her home!

1112
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:20,583
I'm not saying that we have to smoke it.
It… it's symbolic.

1113
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,458
I'm not really good with hugs.

Hey! How do we get out of here?

We have to go find Zach.

Go! You know the way out.

These people have families!

Do you know how many times...

1251

Do you know how many times
I've dreamt of that moment?

1252

[panting] Zach!

Jesus.

1255

I had the perfect thing to say

1256
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,208
to his face.

1257
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,250
What's wrong?

1258
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:42,583
Second-guessing giving me
<i>The Art of War</i> on my ninth birthday?

1259
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:48,916
See? Now… now it just sounds stupid.

1260
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,708
He was supposed to be crying and…

1261
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:55,333
And… and aware of his life choices
and consequences and...

1262
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:56,875
Fuck!

1263
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:58,500
Fuckin' sociopath.

No! Oh no!

1266

Does no one know
what that word means anymore?

1270
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:16,708
If I were a sociopath, I'd have
zero emotional investment in the outcome!

1271
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:17,625
Ollie!

1272
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:20,833
<i>This,</i> this is <i>very</i> important to me.

1273
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:24,708
And… and not to mention
extremely work-intensive.

1274
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:28,666
Do you know how hard it is
to make these <i>fucking</i> masks?

1275
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:31,166
[sobbing] Zach, stop, please!
Look, this… this isn't you!

1276
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,416
You have no idea who I am!

1277
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,708
You don't even know who<i> you</i> are!

1278
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:40,125
I've spent my whole life denying who I am.

1279
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:43,791
I was ashamed, but why?
Because I was born with privilege?

1280
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,958
Why should I feel bad about that?

1281
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:49,458
It's not <i>my</i> fault. It's what I was given.

1282
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:55,166
Do you see now?
You're all wearing masks, Makani Sun-woo.

1283
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:59,166
You're all putting on
these… these fake faces.

1284
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:03,208
You're all hypocrites! Just like my dad.

1285
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:07,458
But I… I can't hide
from my dad's last name.

1286
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:12,500
So I… I'm… I'm showing
these people who they are!

1287

Who they <i>really </i>are!

1288
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:18,500
Take one more fucking step,
and I swear to God, I will...

1289
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:19,916
What? What?

1290
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,208
You'll push <i>me</i> into the fire?

1291
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:26,875
Stab me with the same knife you used
on Caleb? On Jackson and Katie?

1292
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:30,083
The same knife you used
to slit Rodrigo's throat?

1293
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:33,000
<i>You</i> killed my dad.

1294
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:34,916
<i>You</i> killed Ollie.

1295
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:37,791
That's why I had to protect myself

1296
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,208
by killing you.

and they find you dead.

I could just put this all on you.

No one would ever know.

1305
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,208
I'll know.

You think having everything
makes you the victim?

1309
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,750
What kind of fucked-up logic is that?

1310
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:18,166
Blaming everyone else for what's wrong?

1311
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,541
When you're what's wrong, Zach.

1312

Look at my face!
