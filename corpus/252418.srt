1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,709
Rambling Rose

2
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,079
In deep Dixieland,
of October is almost summery.

3
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,876
I had come to visit my father.

4
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,199
Mother had died a few years before
and Daddy was living alone.

5
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,437
He wouldn't have it otherwise.

6
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,637
Seeing the old house,
nostalgia for the south gripped me.

7
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,437
The old South I had known
and the people in it.

8
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,639
When I was 13,
a girl came to this house.

9
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,831
I overheard my father
decide with my mother

10
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,679
to hire this girl.

11
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,270
A good-natured, but unfortunate girl,

12
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,793
working for a farm family,
near Gadsden, Alabama.

13
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,031
Thus she was hired,
sight unseen, by a long-distance call.

14
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,708
She was the first person
I ever loved outside my own family.

15
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,759
But, as my father said,

16
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,749
she caused
one hell of a damnable commotion.

17
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,353
Hello.

18
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,958
I'm Rose.

19
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,319
I've come to live with you.

20
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,039
Mother, the new girl's here.

21
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,153
Wonderful.
What's your impression of her?

22
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,989
She's big.
She could beat up Daddy if she wanted.

23
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,070
But she's very girlish.
She wouldn't hurt anybody.

24
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,471
Your impression is very reassuring.

25
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,277
I sensed that she was so.
I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

26
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,279
You mean confirmed, mother.

27
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,190
If it had been confirmed previously,
it would be reconfirmed.

28
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,271
Alright.

29
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,155
You get Doll and Waski.
I'll telephone Daddy.

30
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,115
This is Waski. His real name
is Warren, but we call him Waski.

31
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,717
He dislikes it. I guess, one day
we'll have to stop calling him that.

32
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,559
You can stop it now.

33
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,999
You'll find him a very good boy.
As you can see, he's beautiful.

34
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,357
Rose,
this little girl is Frances.

35
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,430
We call her Dolly.
It's short for Doll or Doll Baby.

36
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,312
Doll Baby, that's worse than Waski.
I want to be called Fran.

37
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,431
Daddy won't allow it.

38
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,075
That young man, you have met.

39
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,269
He is my oldest son
and my most brilliant child.

40
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,792
They say
I brag too much about my children.

41
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,754
I simply tell the truth.
Am I boring you, Rose?

42
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,918
No, ma'am. Not at all.

43
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,554
Good.

44
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,432
I realised the remarkable thing
about Brother when he was 6 weeks old.

45
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,440
He looked at me and recognised me.

46
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,112
He understood me.

47
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,154
Sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

48
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,838
I have to warn you about him.

49
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,669
He can be very dangerous.

50
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,953
He has an evil streak in him.

51
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,473
It is a streak
of pure, sheer meanness.

52
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,754
You'll scare the girl, going into
the 4th dimension like that.

53
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,956
Maybe to you it's the 4th dimension,
but to me, it's the truth.

54
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,713
Well, well,
so Miss Rosebud has arrived.

55
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,634
Yes, indeed.

56
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,955
Doll Baby, take this for me.

57
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,396
Rosebud...

58
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,238
I swear to God, you are
as graceful as a capital letter "S".

59
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,910
You will adorn our house
and give a glow to its old walls.

60
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,429
Yes, indeed.

61
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,476
Now, it is my wife's belief,
which I accept, though do not grasp,

62
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,950
that to hire a person to do
household work is a criminal practice.

63
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,475
You are therefore here as a friend,
and indeed as a member of this family.

64
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,959
In love and harmony, dear Rosebud.
In love and harmony.

65
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,909
Do you understand?

66
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,195
Yes, sir.
I know you've had some troubles.

67
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,756
Those scoundrels in Birmingham
trying to lead you astray, and so on.

68
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,557
Life can be
very cruel to a young girl.

69
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,233
You've had a hard time.

70
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,514
But I hope and believe you've found
a safe haven in this house.

71
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,312
We welcome you to our home.

72
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,035
We welcome you from the heart.

73
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,915
We hope you're happy here.

74
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,592
Thank you, sir.

75
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,759
Hands in your pocket,
pockets in your pants,

76
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,476
watch the turtles
so the hootchie-kootchie dance.

77
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,557
Let's see if she goes in the water.

78
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,915
Waski, you gotta lick your lips.

79
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,268
You mean to those seeds,
they'll snap at you, Waski.

80
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,918
Buddy,
that hotel that Mr. Hillyer runs...

81
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,191
do y'all own it personally?

82
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,310
Yes, it's part of Mother's estate.

83
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,113
Her estate?

84
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,269
Her inheritance. It was left to her
when she was orphaned.

85
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,476
Buddy, your mama was a orphan?

86
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,509
Yes.

87
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,876
Y'all help me shuck.

88
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,469
Hey, Buddy?

89
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,231
Where is Columbia University?
And what is it exactly?

90
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,071
It's an advanced school
for brilliant people, in New York.

91
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,192
New York?

92
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,356
New York! Imagine that,
with all them skyscrapers, and...

93
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,868
... things like that. New York.
And your mama lived there?

94
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,352
Went to that school. Good Lord.

95
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,952
That's something.

96
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,190
Rose? Who were
those scoundrels in Birmingham?

97
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,275
Nobody. Keep shucking.

98
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,790
But who were they?

99
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,518
Bad men, that's all.

100
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,519
Bad in what sense?

101
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,799
Bad is bad, Buddy.
Ain't no sense to it.

102
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,913
Did they try
to make you become a prostitute?

103
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,638
I don't listen to talk like that.
I turn my back and look the other way.

104
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,275
That's why Daddy hired you, isn't it?

105
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,115
T o keep you away
from those scoundrels.

106
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,794
Your daddy is the best and
most kind-hearted man in the world.

107
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,229
Did you hear about
the terrible thing in Cave Spring?

108
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,598
What terrible thing?

109
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,197
There was this old man
that ate his niece.

110
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,955
I did not hear that. I don't hear you.

111
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,234
Chopped her into pork-chops.
- I don't even hear that.

112
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,272
There's terrible things in this world.

113
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,189
Rose, did you hear
about that man in Chattanooga?

114
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,276
Killed his wife with a black widow
spider. She suffered horribly.

115
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,871
You are in one of your evil moods.

116
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,478
That's what it is.

117
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,276
The family's all here.

118
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,116
Reverse-insomnia.

119
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,912
What a curse.

120
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,356
No appetite, either.

121
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,119
Rose, may I have half a cup of coffee?
- I already got it.

122
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,676
Rosebud baby...
you are the light of my life, darling.

123
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,999
You're as pretty as a moonbeam,
and warm as sunshine.

124
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,317
Now, how did we get by without you?

125
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,557
Rose must be
"non compos mentis" this morning.

126
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,150
Must be that time of the month.

127
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,475
She has been a little peaky lately.
- Not till Daddy came.

128
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,755
What, dear?

129
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,874
Your hearing aid is on the blink.
- What?

130
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,118
Your hearing aid
is buzzing at me like a snake.

131
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,038
Waski, I shot you. Fall down.
- I'm going.

132
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,152
Hey, Doll, come on.
I got you, too, Doll.

133
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,113
Mrs. Hillyer?

134
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,230
Yes, dear?

135
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,717
Will you get
your Master's degree soon?

136
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,833
Pretty soon, dear.
When I finish my thesis.

137
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,475
What are you studying right now?
- American history, dear.

138
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,676
Is that the story of this country?
Just like the story of a person?

139
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,909
Exactly.

140
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,231
You must have a wonderful brain!

141
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,270
Rose, darling, you work too hard.

142
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,188
Sit down and have a nice refreshment.

143
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,798
After all you and him has been doing
for me, working hard is nothing.

144
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,999
Mrs. Hillyer?
- Yes?

145
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,998
Is it true you were a orphan?

146
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,875
Yes.

147
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,837
After the age of seven, I was.

148
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,112
Me, too.

149
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,037
Daddy sure is dumb.

150
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,950
Mother didn't notice, either.

151
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,232
You'd think she wouldnotice.
- She is ignorant about such things.

152
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,990
Besides,
her maternal feelings are aroused.

153
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,870
Maternal feelings run deep.

154
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,229
Yeah.

155
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,711
Rose is in terrible shape.
- Yeah, she is.

156
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,355
Shut up, Wawa. You don't even
know what we're talking about.

157
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,793
I do, too.
Rose is madly in love with Daddy.

158
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,040
He loves me. He loves me not.

159
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,876
You don't eats greens?

160
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,108
Alright.

161
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,394
Here, Rose.
T ake my napkin, darlin'. It's OK.

162
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,870
Are you alright? Are you ill?

163
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,871
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
I just spilt the beans.

164
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,392
I have to present my magazine
at the garden club tonight.

165
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,470
I'll drive you. You have no business
at the wheel of an automobile.

166
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,675
Why not? If you're not thinking,
you'll run into a telephone pole.

167
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,477
Darling, I think about what I'm doing,

168
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,273
all the time.

169
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,999
And I have as much right to be
at the wheel of a car as anybody.

170
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,070
Besides, I want you
to help Rose with the dishes.

171
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,717
She isn't feeling well.
- The dishes, darling?

172
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,115
Yes.

173
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,998
You can help, even though
it's not a man-type thing to do.

174
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,514
Man-type things, women-type things.

175
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,158
The creative force behind the universe
doesn't care about such things.

176
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,670
So you can help with the dishes?

177
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,799
Certainly, darling. Delighted.

178
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,999
Thank you, darling.

179
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,829
Come on.

180
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,038
I'll be damned.

181
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,596
It says the moon is 238,000 miles
from the Earth. How about that?

182
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,038
Mister Moon.

183
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,873
It says that it's a solid rock body,
two thousand miles in diameter.

184
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,152
That's fascinating.

185
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,870
I think she's going to kiss him.
- At least.

186
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,150
Oh, God, Mr. Hillyer!

187
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,479
I love you! I tried!
But I can't help it. Kiss me!

188
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,754
Rose, Rose, Rose!
Get off my lap.

189
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,875
Buddy, stop it. I can't see!

190
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,711
I can't help it. - Calm down.
The children will hear you.

191
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,755
No, no. Let's talk about this thing.

192
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,716
Please.
- No, let's calm down and discuss it.

193
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,754
Please. Don't make me get up.

194
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,553
What are they doing?
- Discussing it.

195
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,037
I can't kiss you.
I only kiss Mrs. Hillyer.

196
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,075
But I love you.
- You don't love me. - I do.

197
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,150
Just kiss me once. - If I did,
you wouldn't ask anymore?

198
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,194
Just once.
- On the lips or mouth? - Mouth.

199
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,995
I only kiss Mrs. Hillyer on the mouth.

200
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,273
They're kissing.

201
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,078
What's happening now?

202
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,596
Rose's titty is out.

203
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,509
His hand is on it.

204
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,872
Enough of this damn nonsense.

205
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,398
And I mean enough.

206
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,791
Get up, Rose.
Put your damn tit back in your dress.

207
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,034
You hear me?

208
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,558
Replace that tit.

209
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,033
Damn you, girl.
You made me make a fool out of myself.

210
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,150
She put it away.

211
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,550
A man is supposed to be a fool.
But a woman should have some control.

212
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,639
Now, are you a nitwit?
What's the matter with you?

213
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,271
I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer.
I couldn't help it 'cause I love you.

214
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,598
Rose, Rose,
poor miserable child...

215
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,034
You said you loved Mrs. Hillyer.
Is this any way to repay her?

216
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,838
She would defend you.
She would fight for you like a tiger.

217
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,033
Don't cry, honey.
Don't cry. Here...

218
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,158
Now let me warn you...

219
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,915
I'm standing here at Thermopylae.

220
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,555
I am standing at Thermopylae...

221
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,440
... and the Persians shall not pass.

222
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,789
Now get your tail out of here,
and wash those dishes. Go on!

223
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,274
Wasn't Daddy great?

224
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,110
I bet he wanted to kiss her some more,
but he didn't.

225
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,553
He was probably just scared Mother
would come home early and catch him.

226
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,629
Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.

227
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,718
Ooh, Baby Doll...

228
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,559
Thermopylae...

229
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,309
... The Persians shall not pass.

230
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,478
Buddy, are you asleep?

231
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,957
No, I'm awake.

232
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,833
What's wrong?

233
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,068
Buddy, I have been wandering
in the wilderness, lost.

234
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,515
I feel awful. Do you mind
if I get in bed with you for a while?

235
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,629
Alright.

236
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,111
I'll be quiet.

237
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,552
I'll lie here a while.
You go on back to sleep.

238
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,948
Oh, Buddy, you don't know
how it hurts to have a broken heart.

239
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,919
Men, I don't understand 'em.

240
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,511
I can't see through them.
I can't figure them out.

241
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,713
They break my heart, that's all.

242
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,155
But this is the worst ever.

243
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,558
'Cause
it wasn't his fault, it was mine.

244
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,638
I was bad.

245
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,314
You wouldn't believe how bad I was.

246
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,876
What did you do, Rose?

247
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,315
I was just awful, Buddy.

248
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,909
Worse than you could know,
a child like you.

249
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,710
It isn't just the loss of him...

250
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,197
... but my own bad behavior
what bothers me so.

251
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,677
It has just made me ill. I am sick.

252
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,796
What was the cause of it all?

253
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,357
You promise
not to tell Doll or nobody?

254
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,153
It's your Daddy. I'm so much in love
with him, I'm out of my mind.

255
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,114
How could such a thing happen?

256
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,076
You know, when I first come,
and he says I looked graceful

257
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,115
like the letter "S",
and called me "Rosebud"?

258
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,073
I fell madly in love
with him right there, right then.

259
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,190
But it's a lost love.

260
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,948
He's a good man.
He won't have nothing to do with me.

261
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,830
Can I touch you here?
It's soft.

262
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,589
It's awful soft.
- What did you expect?

263
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,352
I thought it was like a cantaloupe.
- That's some idea, a cantaloupe.

264
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,110
There's some gristle in it.
- Buddy, quit that.

265
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,677
You're just a child. You shouldn't be
interested about such things.

266
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,792
Actually, I am.

267
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,996
That daddy of yours
is the funniest man.

268
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,070
The things he says.
You never know what he'll say next.

269
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,674
Can I
put my hand inside your nightgown?

270
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,875
No, you can't. I'll tell you
something else. He scares me.

271
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,869
You can't fool around with him.
Not with that man.

272
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,989
If I ever do that again,
he'll fire me.

273
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,192
Can I see what nipple looks like?

274
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,196
Buddy, what has come over you?
A child like you, asking such things.

275
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,592
I'm curious, Rose.

276
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,160
Buddy, get your hand away. Quit it!
Get your hand off of me, Buddy!

277
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,958
Buddy, come on.
- Just for a second. What's the harm?

278
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,188
You don't realize it,
but what you're doing isn't nice.

279
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,234
Can't I just see
what the nipple looks like?

280
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,117
Are you satisfied now?

281
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,672
Can we lie and talk now, huh?

282
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,315
It has a nipple.
- Or course.

283
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,355
At first
I couldn't feel it, but now I do.

284
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,076
It's like an acorn.
- OK, Buddy, that's enough.

285
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,399
You're just a child, and wouldn't
understand, but that type of thing...

286
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,876
... can stir a girl up.

287
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,837
Now you lie down and we'll just talk.

288
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,551
It was softer than I thought.
That was my main impression.

289
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,229
If you hit a girl there,
it could hurt her a lot.

290
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,196
Who would do a thing such as that?

291
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,950
Some fiend might.

292
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,110
You know, Buddy,
I can't figure you out at all.

293
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,872
You can be very nice, but like your
mama said, you have an evil streak.

294
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,472
Everyone does, Rose.

295
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,838
Your Daddy doesn't.

296
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,796
What has happened
has made me love your pa more.

297
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,513
I not only love him,
I respect him.

298
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,029
I admire him.

299
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,798
I have a serious favor to ask.
- Most men would act like he did.

300
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,519
If they get a girl, they go ahead
and get her. Just like some monkey.

301
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,630
Then they tell her she's no good,
when they done the same thing.

302
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,915
Since you're here in bed with me, and
I've already touched your titty...

303
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,829
Buddy, what an awful thing to say!

304
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,760
Where did you get
any such idea as that, anyhow?

305
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,510
I'm curious, Rose.
I'm real curious.

306
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,199
Well that is just too bad.
Curiosity killed the cat.

307
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,712
Yeah, but satisfaction
brought him back. May I?

308
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,553
No. You should be ashamed, asking
such a nasty thing, a child your age.

309
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,074
Can't I touch it just a little bit?
Just to see what it's like?

310
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,635
No.

311
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,913
Oh, Rose, I'm curious.
Can't I touch it for a second?

312
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,598
Aren't you my friend?
Don't you like me?

313
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,553
I like you a lot.

314
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,833
In fact, I love you.

315
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,796
You're sweet, Buddy,
but you don't really love me. - I do!

316
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,674
Don't you like me just a little bit?

317
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,039
Sure I like you, Buddy.
But you're just a child.

318
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,472
I'm 13 and I have a natural curiosity.

319
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,515
It's nature, Rose.
Now what's wrong with nature?

320
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,352
Honey, what's the matter?

321
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,554
Just that...

322
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,115
... damnable reverse-insomnia.
You go back to sleep.

323
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,877
The Depression has got me.

324
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,357
Strong men weeping, children hungry.

325
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,235
What a life, what a world.

326
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,198
Buddy, quit it.

327
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,513
Am I hurting you?

328
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,554
No, you're not hurting me.

329
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,792
You just better quit it, that's all.
- Why, if I'm not hurting you?

330
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,951
You wouldn't understand.

331
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,512
I must be out of my mind.

332
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,069
This is definitely the most
fascinating experience of my life.

333
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,639
Oh, Lord.

334
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,832
Man rises like sparks in a fire.

335
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,954
What's wrong, Rose?

336
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,274
Are you sick?

337
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,592
I have robbed a cradle
and fell into hell.

338
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,917
I must be crazy!

339
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
I got to get out of here!

340
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,872
Buddy,
you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?

341
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,197
No, I won't tell a soul.

342
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,596
I sure hope you don't.

343
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,759
I got to get out of here.

344
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,433
I hate to turn this light on.
Your daddy is downstairs.

345
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,193
I have to take the chance.
Buddy, please don't tell on me.

346
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:32,277
I said I wouldn't.
- Buddy, I never meant to harm you.

347
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,076
I'd never hurt you, ever.
But they'd think I did.

348
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,911
I don't see why you're so worried.
It was my idea. - You don't get it.

349
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,955
They'd blame me, not you.
They'd think I was awful.

350
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,393
A disgusting girl, which I am.
But please don't tell! Please!

351
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,592
Rose, what did those scoundrels
in Birmingham want with you?

352
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,270
They wanted what you said.
- For you to be a prostitute?

353
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,234
How much do they pay girls to do it?

354
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,275
In the house in Birmingham, 3 dollars.

355
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,314
The girls got a dollar
and the house took two.

356
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,833
How many men did they have to
do it with in a day? - I don't know.

357
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,149
10 or 12, I guess. Maybe more.

358
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,750
Twelve, that's a lot of men.

359
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,948
They probably had BO.
and needed shaves.

360
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,914
Probably.

361
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,875
On the other hand,
12 men a day at a dollar each.

362
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,679
In two days, you'd make
what you make here in a month.

363
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,711
Buddy, I don't want to be no whore.

364
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,674
I can't. It'd kill me.

365
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,152
But that isn't why
I don't want you to tell them.

366
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,359
The reason is...

367
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,112
... I love it here.
I love your whole family.

368
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,269
And Buddy...
I don't want to have to go.

369
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,233
So please...

370
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,478
... if you like me a little bit...

371
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,354
... don't tell them, please!

372
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,759
I know that I'm a bad girl.

373
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,357
But please have pity on me. Please.

374
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,314
Buddy, don't tell them. Please don't.

375
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,037
I won't tell on you, Rose.

376
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,233
They could
put splinters under my fingernails...

377
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,830
... and I would never tell.

378
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,236
Because I love you, Rose.

379
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,913
Thank you, Buddy.

380
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,512
When I start bothering your Daddy,

381
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,793
even worse, robbing a cradle,

382
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,312
I gotta face the facts of life.

383
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,836
T omorrow...

384
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,478
I'm going to get myself up and go out.

385
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,391
Get yourself up and go out?

386
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,669
Buddy,

387
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,359
Mr. Right is out there somewheres,

388
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,631
and I'm going to find him.

389
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,510
If I have to wake you up
at 11:00 in the morning,

390
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,953
either you're sick,
or you were up very late last night.

391
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,153
You weren't reading
"Huckleberry Finn".

392
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,353
I looked in your room.
It's not there.

393
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,430
What were you doing?

394
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,877
I have to tell the truth.
- Of course.

395
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,719
I was reading one of those
dirty comic books. - Oh, Brother!

396
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,196
I'm so disappointed in you.

397
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,632
You mustn't read them.
They degrade the human image.

398
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,992
They're filthy.
- Sex isn't ugly.

399
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,116
It's very beautiful. The creative
power of the universe designed it.

400
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,473
I know. We must respect it.
We must be in awe of it.

401
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,319
Oh, I am in awe of it.
- Not enough. Get the castor oil.

402
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,433
Can't it be Calomel? - This is not
punishment. It's for your health.

403
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,475
If you act like this,
you are full of poisons, you are sick.

404
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,149
Here, Buddy.

405
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,710
Here we go. Open up.

406
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,831
One, two, open up.

407
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,235
Good.

408
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,391
Goddamn crap.

409
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,598
What'd you say?

410
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,558
I said "putrid stuff."
- No, you didn't, Brother.

411
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,949
I did. Your hearing aid isn't working.

412
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,391
He's lying.
- Doll, I'll cut your guts out.

413
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,196
And yesterday he stole money out...
- Shut up, you brat!

414
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,596
Children, be quiet.

415
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,430
The strangest
vibrations are in this house today.

416
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,677
Where is Rose, anyway?

417
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,190
Getting herself up to go out.
- What did you say?

418
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,952
She's getting herself up to go out.
- Out? Oh, yes, it's Thursday.

419
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,629
Oh! Hello, Rose, dear.

420
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,759
My, you're looking..

421
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,471
... pretty. - Like my outfit?
I made most of it myself.

422
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,430
Well...

423
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,872
It's very... cheerful.

424
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,595
I have a knack for designing clothes.

425
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,478
For the day...

426
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,233
isn't it... tight?
- It's meant to be clinging.

427
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,833
Holy catfish!
What have you done to yourself?

428
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,393
I got myself up is all.
- Got yourself up?

429
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,473
I'm going out. - You're going
out in public like in those clothes?

430
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,758
Darling, I wish
you wouldn't pick on Rose.

431
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,518
Ignore him. You look very pretty.
- You're sweet.

432
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,834
Come on, Waski, stop it.
- No.

433
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,519
Daddy, Buddy was up late
reading dirty comic books.

434
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,398
Mother gave him castor oil,
and he cursed it, and took

435
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,274
the Lord's name in vain,
then he claimed he hadn't said it.

436
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,555
Don't be a tattletale. You mustn't be
Delilahish with your brother.

437
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,590
I'm only trying to help him.
- What a hypocrite.

438
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,632
You must talk to him. He was
reading those ghastly books again.

439
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,310
Lay off that stuff, son.
It upsets your mother.

440
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,671
I mean seriously speak with him.

441
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,839
He shouldn't
read those depraved things.

442
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,589
OK.
I'll take him with me downtown.

443
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,315
You, too, Rose, if you want a ride.

444
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,398
I'd love one.

445
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,713
I'm going out amongst 'em, boys.

446
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,992
Gumballs...

447
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,599
Gumballs!
- Yes, ma'am.

448
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,474
My feet sure do hurt.

449
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,754
I bet they don't hurt as much as mine.

450
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,193
Why do yours hurt?
- I'm a salesman. Do a lot of walking.

451
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,633
Incredible, the swiftness of it.

452
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,114
The girl strikes like a cobra.

453
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,799
That girl bothers me.

454
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,758
She bothers you?

455
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,148
In what way, dear?

456
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,354
It is a little tedious
having her around.

457
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,719
You think Rose is tedious?

458
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,037
I don't think she's tedious.

459
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,392
I think
she's the very opposite of tedious.

460
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,991
From a man's standpoint,
she's tedious.

461
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,109
She's back.
And in one piece, I hope.

462
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,628
I thought you liked Rose.
- I'm crazy about Rose.

463
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,992
I just hope she
isn't a hotcha character, that's all.

464
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,279
Hotcha character?

465
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,830
What you don't understand is,

466
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,396
it's positive energy on this planet.

467
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,957
It's what we do with it
that makes it negative.

468
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,712
Darling, don't go off
into the 4th dimension, all right?

469
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,753
Every time...

470
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,192
Every time I say something important,

471
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,550
you always say
I've gone off into the 4th dimension.

472
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,318
Well I don't entirely grasp
your philosophy, but I respect it.

473
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,988
I respect it.

474
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,034
Then I wish you wouldn't
say cynical and mean things,

475
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,119
that go against life itself.

476
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,515
What's so cynical about hoping
Rose isn't a hotcha character?

477
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,157
She just wants
to look pretty, that's all.

478
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,389
We are not going to argue about this.

479
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,469
I can see that you are beyond reason.

480
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,912
So are you, dear.
So are you.

481
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,430
I don't want to talk to you.

482
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,440
I'm not going to talk with you.

483
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,679
I can't hear you.

484
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,352
Sweetheart, your hearing aid
is buzzing. I didn't hear you.

485
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,799
I said be quiet.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

486
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,789
I have nothing to say.
It's obvious you don't love me,

487
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,549
or even respect me.

488
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,432
I love and adore you, sweetheart.
You know that.

489
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,234
Do you?
You know I do.

490
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,757
I just hope that Rose's bite
isn't as bad as her bark.

491
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,113
It's not.
You just don't understand her.

492
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,357
It isn't sex she wants. It's love.

493
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,916
Those silly clothes she wears

494
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,909
is the only way she knows to get it.

495
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,356
You may be right, but I'm afraid we'll
rue the day Rosebud came to our house.

496
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,228
I disagree with you.
She's a very sweet girl.

497
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,032
And she loves children.

498
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,916
She loves everybody,
that's her problem.

499
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,230
Everybody.
- That's not a bad quality.

500
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,797
No, it's a beautiful quality.

501
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,832
You're right as rain, sweetheart.

502
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,551
You sleepy?
- No.

503
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,878
You sleepy?

504
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,876
Can you hear me?
- I don't need to, I can feel you.

505
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,309
Rose!

506
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,075
The scruffy man is back in the garden.
- Well, I don't know him.

507
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,158
I'm going to call Daddy.

508
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,877
Have a good stay.

509
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,436
Grand Hotel.

510
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,838
The scruffy looking man is back.

511
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,072
I'll be right there.

512
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,316
Where is he?
- Over there.

513
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,833
Come here! Come back here, you!

514
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,039
Come back here!

515
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,996
I couldn't catch him.

516
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,431
He ran like a deer.

517
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,072
I don't know him.

518
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,994
Doll, I got St. Louis
on my crystal radio.

519
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,479
I don't care about your radio.
I'm worried about Rose.
