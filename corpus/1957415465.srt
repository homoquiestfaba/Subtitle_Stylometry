Get those people out
of the back yard, please.

366
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,295
I'm telling you
something is wrong.

367
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,930
Kelsie, what the hell
are you doing here?

368
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,098
- Listen to me.
- No body, there's no weapon,

369
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,699
there's no murder.

370
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,101
Have you seen the video?

371
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,336
There was some kind
of a found footage

372
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:26,736
slasher horror thing.

373
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:28,272
It's a publicity stunt.

374
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,572
Okay, well she wouldn't
have left her cat, okay?

375
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:30,975
- There's no food.
- Kelsie-

376
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,476
- There's no water, I'm
telling you something...

377
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,778
- Listen, to me lady!
- Is wrong.

378
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,645
So we're all getting
off the property

379
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,214
or I'm gonna put
the cuffs on you.

380
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,983
That is up to you, that's
up to all of you people,

381
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,052
but we are off the property.

382
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,155
[Kelsie sighs]

00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,923
[tense music]

384
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,192
Cuffs are coming out if
you're still on this property

385
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,559
in five minutes.

[suspenseful music]

390
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:20,858
Oh my God.

391
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,828
No.

392
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,764
Oh.

393
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:30,101
[tense music]

394
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,971
Hello?

395
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:38,209
Hello?

396
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:45,816
Oh my God, what is this?

397
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:51,621
Hello?

398
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:54,758
Anybody!

[Lar groaning]

404
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,991
[Man] Naughty girl.

405
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,726
Just when I was bringing
you some dinner,

406
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,661
and some chocolate.

407
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:33,197
Your favorite, right?

408
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:34,664
Cold water?

409
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,934
It's been three days.

410
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:40,304
I'm sure you would've
really enjoyed that.

411
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,740
[man chuckling]

412
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,708
There's no escape.

413
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,012
Why are you doing this?

414
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,381
[Man] I don't
wanna hurt you, Tina.

415
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:52,715
I wanna take care of you.

416
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:56,120
I'm not Tina.

417
00:23:57,388 --> 00:23:59,722
[Man] You shouldn't
post your worst fears

418
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,525
for the world to see.

419
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:04,328
Welcome to your hell.

420
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,400

422
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:18,943
Please come back.

423
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:23,314
I've been really naughty.

424
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,417
But I've learned my lesson.

425
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:34,191
Let me out for a
little bit, please?

426
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:39,330
[Man] When I was a kid, my dad

427
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,800
used to lock me in the
basement when I was bad.

428
00:24:42,866 --> 00:24:46,470
The only thing I had
to keep me company

429
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:49,240
was a stack of VHS tapes.

430
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:54,511
"Friday the 13th" and
"Halloween," the entire sagas.

431
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:58,015
You all became my family.

432
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:00,884
You're all I had.

433
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:04,855
So I wrote, and I wrote.

434
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:12,062
But you never wrote back!

435
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:15,299
I would have written.

436
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,002
If I had gotten your letters.

437
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:21,272
You sound so nice.

438
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,074
I didn't get any of the letters.

439
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,377
If I got the letters,
I would have written.

440
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:29,413
I'm so sorry that
everybody hurt you.

441
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:35,986
You just let me out a
minute, just for a minute.

442
00:25:38,489 --> 00:25:40,391
Just hold my hand.

443
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:44,995
Sir.

444
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:46,497
[Man] You're weak!

445
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:48,032
Pathetic.

446
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,570
No one will ever
find you but the rats

447
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,440
that will feast on your corpse.

448
00:25:56,507 --> 00:25:57,708
[suspenseful music]

Ah.

452
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,464
Hey, Judie.

453
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:21,865
Oh my God.

454
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:23,534
Been way too long.

455
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,337
You had a stalker, right?

456
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:27,604
Yeah.

457
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,206
Why is, somebody bothering you?

458
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:32,309
Yeah, it started out as
normal kinda creepy stuff,

459
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:34,645
like "You're my best friend,"
or "Wouldn't it be cool

460
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:38,349
if you died in real life like
you did in 'Friday the 13th'?"

461
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:41,585
But then, he's
sending photos now.

462
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:47,624
Hard copies started
showing up in my mailbox,

463
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:52,831
in a menu at a restaurant,
in my gym bag, my home.

464
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,565
Even at my mother's home.

Sausalito murders.

468
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:27,866
I've covered higher profile
murder cases in my day,

469
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,900
The OJ Simpson trial.

470
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:33,971
But this one still haunts me.

471
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:37,241
Dale.

472
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,844
Is it true that you
were in "Friday the 13th?"

473
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,345
Yes.

474
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:43,547
A blue bikini.

475
00:27:43,614 --> 00:27:45,048
That is so cool.

476
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:48,218
All right, guys, your
assignment for the weekend.

477
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,387
I want you to go out
and produce a news story

478
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:53,056
about something exciting
you do over the weekend.

479
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:54,191

about how big a fan he is,
had me sign a couple things,

00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:24,528
I believe in you.

551
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:29,033
Kane, who cares if some
fucking asshole producer does?

552
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,267
Look, Kane.

553
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,769
This has always been your dream.

554
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:34,271
Let's green-light
this ourselves.

555
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,672
We'll produce the play.

556
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:38,642
I'll be your Stella,
you'll be my Stanley.

557
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,012
Maybe you're right.

558
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:45,282
So is that crazy stalker
still bothering you?

559
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:51,421
Kane, I'm worried.

560
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:55,159
A lot of actresses are worried.

561
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,728
I've seen a lot of
fanboys in my day.

562
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,734
There's just something
about this one.

563
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,269
[tense music]

564
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,593
[kettle whistling]

565
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:50,313
[text messages dinging]

566
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:59,891
[tense music]
[Jennifer crying]

567
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,502
[phone ringing]

568
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:14,272
- Jen?
- Kane?

569
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:16,140
It's happening again.

570
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:17,741
Okay, have you
called the police?

571
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:21,344
I've called them before,
it doesn't do any good.

572
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,047
They come, they take
a report, they leave.

573
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:25,817
[Kane] Have they traced
the phone number at least?

574
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:26,918
They've tried.

575
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:29,821
He uses burner phones.

576
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:35,458
I block one number, by the
next day, he has another.

577
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:36,593
Please tell me
you're almost here.

578
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,962
Do you trust me?

579
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:39,429
Of course.

580
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,865
I'm close by.

581
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:43,400
Go up to your room,
turn off your light

582
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:45,335
- like you're going to bed.
- Why?

583
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:46,871
Just do it.

584
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:48,438
I'm on my way.

585
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,841
Be there soon.

586
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,577
[tense music]

587
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:58,448
[text messages dinging]

588
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:01,118
[Jennifer whimpering]

589
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,761

00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:08,185
[suspenseful music]

596
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:26,370
Kane!

597
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,570
[suspenseful music]

598
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:30,875
[Jennifer screams]

599
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,617
[Jennifer screams]

600
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:42,652
[tense music]

601
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,756
[Man] The one thing
the franchise taught me

602
00:36:45,823 --> 00:36:49,559
is that death is an art.

603
00:36:52,763 --> 00:36:56,733
I take great pride
designing each and every

604
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:59,569
one of my kills for my loves.

605
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,074
Jen.

606
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:07,610
[Man] You used to
take my breath away.

607
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,613
Now I'm gonna take yours.

608
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:17,922
[Jennifer choking]

609
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:21,792
Jen!

610
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,171
[Kane groans]

611
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:36,606
[Jennifer choking]

612
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:37,808
Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen!

613
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,078
[suspenseful music]

614
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,684
[Jennifer crying]
[solemn music]

615
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:50,221
Nearly lost you.

616
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,141
[solemn music]

617
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:11,342
Kane!

618
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:12,443
Kane!

619
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,779
Don't you dare die on me!

620
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:17,647
You don't have to yell,
I'm right in front of you.

621
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,650
[Jennifer crying]

622
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,019
You can't die.

623
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,586
[siren wailing]

624
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:24,889
You're Kane Hodder.

625
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:28,793
You're Kane Hodder.

626
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,062
I'm Kane Hodder, yep.

627
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:35,598
Flesh and blood, I bleed
like everyone else.

628
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,069
No.

629
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:43,307
That Kane on the screen,
yeah, he can never die.

630
00:38:46,377 --> 00:38:48,279
But that's not reality.

631
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,149
I'm a husband to
a beautiful woman,

632
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:58,189
And father to two amazing sons.

633
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,961
[Jennifer crying]

634
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:10,234
I was there when my dad
was at the end of his life,

635
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:14,238
and I never said, "I love you."

636
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,377
Please, tell my wife and
sons that I love them.

637
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:23,781
[Jennifer crying]

638
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,951
[Jennifer mumbling]

639
00:39:29,753 --> 00:39:31,889
No stunt coordinator.

640
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:38,596
[Jennifer crying]

641
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:41,966
[dramatic music]

642
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:43,601
Hang in there, buddy.

643
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,302
EMT is on the way.

644
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:57,047
[tense music]

645
00:40:05,122 --> 00:40:07,992
Hey, come on, sleepyhead.

646
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:12,396
Dear God, what
time did you get up?

647
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:14,765
Six.

648
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:20,004
I love you for not
waking me up then.

649
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,305
[Ron] Love you too.

650
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,341
I can do this.

651
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:39,890
Hey Ronnie, you know where
my gold earrings are?

652
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:41,425
Yeah, I saw you put
them in the jewelry box

653
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:43,360
- last night.
- Yeah, but they're not there.

654
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:48,365
Well, that's weird.

655
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,136
You must've dropped them.

656
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:57,374
No, not on the floor.

657
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,410
[door closes]

658
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:01,512
I guess we're both
losing our minds.

659
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,847
[Dee gasping]

660
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,719
[tense music]

661
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,032
[Dee gasping]

662
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:24,468
[knocking on door]

663
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:26,036
Dee.

664
00:41:39,683 --> 00:41:42,019
Get it together, Dee.

665
00:41:42,086 --> 00:41:44,355
Hey Dee, I'm heading
out to the grocery store

666
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:47,024
to pick up a few things.
You need anything?

667
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:49,126
[knocking on door]

668
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:50,027
Dee?

669
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:52,363
No, nothing, sorry.

670
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:54,231
You okay?

671
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:56,800
Yeah, just an upset stomach.

672
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,702
[Dee crying]

673
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,938
I won't be long, honey.

674
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:03,073
[Dee crying]

675
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,309
Call me if you need anything.

676
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:11,415
[Dee crying]

677
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:12,716
[suspenseful music]

678
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,486
[phone buzzes]

679
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:35,539
Come on.

680
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:37,107
Past time to leave.

681
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:51,121
Little short, don't you think?

682
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,360
Hey Dee, it's Judie.

683
00:42:56,427 --> 00:42:58,429
So the producer
of "Snuffed Out,"

684
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:01,565
that thing that I showed
you guys the other day,

685
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:04,735
Vincente Disanti, he
wants you to star in it.

686
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,071
Yeah, he's a little
bit of an ass,

687
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:11,642
but he's a really good
producer, and I'm in it, so.

688
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:17,581
So expect a call and
would love to work

689
00:43:18,982 --> 00:43:21,085
with the great Dee
Wallace, finally.

690
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:22,486
All right, let me
know how it goes.

691
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:23,620
Bye.

692
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,358
Bit of an ass, huh?

693
00:43:27,424 --> 00:43:29,526
[Judie] She'll be
expecting your call.

694
00:43:29,593 --> 00:43:30,861
Well, thank you.

695
00:43:38,902 --> 00:43:40,604
- Kelsie.
- Mm-hmm.

696
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,972
Hey, Kelsie.

697
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,474
You know, I don't
know if you know this,

698
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,743
but first of all, great
work out there today.

699
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,111
- Amazing stuff.
- Thank you!

700
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:48,545
But also, I don't
know if you know,

701
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:51,548
but I actually collect
all of your cage fights.

702
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:53,283
- I've got all of them.
- That's nice.

703
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,485
Yeah.

704
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,220
Why are you putting
the robe on, though?

705
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:57,654
Gotta keep wardrobe clean.
You know this, Mike.

706
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:58,956
Yeah, I know, but
then you ruin the view

707
00:43:59,022 --> 00:44:00,524
for the rest of us.

708
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:01,860
'Cause, well...

709
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:03,394
Great scene, Kels.

710
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,297
Kelsie, are you doing
the shower scene later?

711
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:09,834
Uh-huh.

712
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,435
That's good.

713
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,971
'Cause I'm really looking
forward to the nude scene.

714
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:16,440
Aren't we all.

715
00:44:16,507 --> 00:44:17,508
Aren't we all.

716
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,543
Yeah, I think
everybody here is.

717
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,677
Chris!

718
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:24,314
- Hey baby.
- Ah, lips, lips, lips!

719
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,484
Cute.

720
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:34,158
So, you're the lucky guy, huh?

721
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:36,660
You get to...

722
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:39,496
Out my index finger
in the okay sign?

723
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,299
With her.

724
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:44,067
- With her.
- All the time.

725
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,602
[Chris] All the time.

726
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:48,038
You're a lucky guy.

727
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:54,511
- Where'd you get that?
- What?

728
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:58,783
I've never seen that before.

729
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,217
[tense music]

730
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:02,619
Jesus Christ, who
the fuck is that guy?

731
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:04,154
Mike Merryman.

732
00:45:04,221 --> 00:45:05,522
Put like a hundred
grand into the film

733
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:07,224
so now he gets to be
a pain in the ass.

734
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,626
Grabs my ass one more
time, there's about to be

735
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:11,295
an accident with
the curling iron.

736
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:13,163
He grabbed my ass yesterday.

737
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,666
What?

738
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:18,001
He can grab my ass any time.

739
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,370
Honey, that's just
Mike being Mike.

740
00:45:20,437 --> 00:45:22,406
You put that much
money into a movie,

741
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:26,176
you have carte blanche
to handle all the goods.

742
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:28,378
Can't do anything about it.

743
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:30,414
Nor would I want to.

744
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,616
- I can do something about it.
- Chris.

745
00:45:32,683 --> 00:45:33,684
I like my job.

746
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,085
What are you doing here?

747
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:36,353
100K, that's not
even that much money.

748
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,388
This is like a
$2.5 million film.

749
00:45:38,455 --> 00:45:39,858
It's enough they
let him hang on set

750
00:45:39,924 --> 00:45:41,091
and be as creepy
as he wants to be.

751
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:42,493
Kelsie, we have one more scene

752
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:44,361
and you are released
for the day.

753
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:46,196
Part your lips a little bit?

754
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:48,432
As per your agent, you
have the next three days off.

755
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:52,669
Second AD will send you a
call sheet Wednesday night

756
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:54,071
- with-
- Part your lips a little bit?

757
00:45:54,137 --> 00:45:55,506
[tense music]

758
00:45:55,572 --> 00:45:58,175
- Uh-huh.
- Grabbed my ass yesterday.

759
00:45:58,242 --> 00:45:59,576
You put that much money...

760
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:02,179
I'm looking forward
to the nude scene.

761
00:46:02,246 --> 00:46:04,715
Kelsie. You with me?

762
00:46:04,782 --> 00:46:06,550
Yeah.

763
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:07,785
Great.

764
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:11,355
Okay people, back
in five, back in five.

765
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:13,958
- Yeah, I'm gonna grab food.
- Okay.

766
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,359
Kels.

767
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:17,528
Some producer guy
wants to meet you.

768
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:19,396
[tense music]

769
00:46:19,463 --> 00:46:20,965
- Oh, hey, Kelsie Voorhees?
- Hi.

770
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,599
Vincente Disanti, I'm the
producer on "Snuffed Out."

771
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:23,835
We're currently casting
for the film, and I-

772
00:46:23,902 --> 00:46:25,569
- "Snuffed Out?"
- Yeah.

773
00:46:25,636 --> 00:46:27,704
You're the creep exploiting
the death of Lar Park Lincoln,

774
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:29,106
and my grandmother.

775
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:30,942
You're advertising everywhere.

776
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:33,811
The same man who killed Deborah
Voorhees also killed Lar?

777
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,847
Really? That's tasteless.

778
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,748
What happened to your
grandmother was unfortunate.

779
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:38,816
Unfortunate?

780
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:40,317
Kelsie, I understand-

781
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,552
- Were you in the
woods that night?

782
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:42,854
Did you watch your
grandmother die?

783
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,621
You don't understand shit.

784
00:46:44,688 --> 00:46:46,758
[Woman] Kelsie,
we're ready for you.

785
00:46:48,826 --> 00:46:50,193
All right, let's be honest.

786
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,628
You only got cast in
this role because you're

787
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:53,096
a cute little cage
fighter with the last name

788
00:46:53,163 --> 00:46:54,731
of a famous slasher
movie villain.

789
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:56,768
We're both opportunists, so
come on, what do you say?

790
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:58,101
Fuck you.

791
00:46:58,803 --> 00:47:00,103
All right, let's do this.

792
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,439
All right. Quiet on the set.

793
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,609
- Sound? Camera?
- Audio speeds. Rolling

794
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:08,278
Scene 44, Victor,
take one, mark.

795
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:11,849
Action.

796
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,392
[suspenseful music]

797
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:33,938
Somebody help me, please!

798
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:37,174
[dramatic music]

799
00:47:38,508 --> 00:47:39,710
Babe, it's not your fault.

800
00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:41,079
I didn't double,
triple check it.

801
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:42,746
Kels, it's not your job.

802
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:44,281
A woman is dead!

803
00:47:44,348 --> 00:47:45,817
And she died in my hands.

804
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:48,953
Do you think it matters
whose fucking job it was?!

805
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,687
Dammit!

806
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:55,292
I didn't fucking
check the knife.

807
00:47:57,028 --> 00:47:58,128
[Kelsie crying]

808
00:47:58,195 --> 00:47:59,229
Babe.

809
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,798
Just stay home tonight.

810
00:48:00,865 --> 00:48:02,532
I don't want you
driving in this state

811
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,501
and I can't make
the plane either.

812
00:48:04,568 --> 00:48:06,269
I haven't slept in 24 hours.

813
00:48:06,336 --> 00:48:07,437
I'm exhausted.

814
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:08,840
I just need her, Chris.

815
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:10,507
I know, I know.

816
00:48:10,574 --> 00:48:12,076
I'll drive you anywhere you
want to go in the morning.

817
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:14,846
[tense music]

818
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:31,528
[Dee sighs]

819
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,906
[girl laughing]

820
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:43,841
- Birdie.
- What's wrong?

821
00:48:46,543 --> 00:48:48,578
If anything happens to me...

822
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:51,049
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

823
00:48:51,115 --> 00:48:52,416
Deborah.

824
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:56,353
You cannot live
your life in fear.

825
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,789
I feel it in my gut.

826
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,724
This fanboy is dangerous.

827
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,326
Sweetheart.

828
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:08,665
Who's gonna be my grandma now?

829
00:49:08,732 --> 00:49:10,367
I will be your
grandma, sweetheart.

830
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:13,104
[solemn music]

831
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:14,806
I will be your grandma forever.

832
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:16,107
[knocking on door]

833
00:49:16,174 --> 00:49:17,407
Hey.

834
00:49:17,474 --> 00:49:19,242
God, honey, please
don't do that.

835
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:20,610
Sorry, babe.

836
00:49:23,781 --> 00:49:25,248
You need to eat.

837
00:49:25,315 --> 00:49:26,616
Not hungry.

838
00:49:27,617 --> 00:49:29,854
You know grieving
won't bring her back.

839
00:49:30,955 --> 00:49:34,025
Every anniversary of her
death, it's the same thing.

840
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:35,459
When's this gonna finally end?

841
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:37,227
I don't know, honey,
maybe when my friend

842
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:38,896
isn't dead anymore.

843
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:42,900
You gotta stop
blaming yourself.

844
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:44,434
You couldn't have known.

845
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:46,971
Okay look, we've been
over this a million times.

846
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:50,440
I should have believed her and
I should have done something.

847
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:56,513
[gulls cawing]
[waves crashing]

848
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,716
[camera shutter clicking]

849
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,523
You make such a
beautiful murdered woman.

850
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:11,763
Who likes looking at
photos of naked dead women?

851
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:13,363
Horror fans.

852
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,700
[camera shutter clicks]

853
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:18,368
Beautiful.

854
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:19,669
That's a wrap, guys.

855
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,344
There's my girls!

856
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,712
Hi, sweetheart.

857
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:32,382
I wanna pet him,
I wanna pet him!

858
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:33,918
Okay, okay.

859
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:36,720
Everybody's gonna get a
chance with the doggy.

860
00:50:36,788 --> 00:50:38,122
Hey, thanks.

861
00:50:38,189 --> 00:50:40,290
The kids always cheer her up.

862
00:50:40,357 --> 00:50:41,491
Love you, Mom.

863
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:42,994
Have a good day, Abby.

864
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,427
Bye guys.

865
00:50:44,494 --> 00:50:46,363
We'll pick them up
Monday morning, okay?

866
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:48,365
- Okay.
- Hey.

867
00:50:48,431 --> 00:50:50,433
Let me take that for you.
[groans]

868
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,870
What do you got in here, rocks?

869
00:50:55,273 --> 00:50:56,406
[tense music]

870
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:57,541
There we go.

871
00:50:57,607 --> 00:50:58,843
- Hold up.
- Okay.

872
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,312
Is it refrigerator-ready,
Grandma?

873
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:03,680
Oh!

874
00:51:04,215 --> 00:51:05,549
I don't know, let's go see.

875
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:07,584
Come on, walk this way.

876
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:14,624
[camera shutter clicks]

877
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,096
Love it.

878
00:51:20,064 --> 00:51:21,265
Thank you.

879
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,001
[phone ringing]
Oh.

880
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:27,905
Janey.

881
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:29,506
Yeah.

882
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:30,975
How are you?

883
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:33,311
[camera shutter clicks]

884
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:35,612
Can we look at
the stars, Grandma?

885
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:38,381
Well, hey, I hope
you have good news.

886
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,450
Grandma, can we
set up the telescope?

887
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,986
Stars, stars,
let's go, Grandma!

888
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,120
I already set it up.

889
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:44,421
Come on, you guys.

890
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:45,923
We're gonna look at Pluto.

891
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,762
[camera shutter clicking]

892
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:53,563
They won't even read it?

893
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,465
- What are you seeing?
- Stars!

894
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:59,103
That's called the Milky Way.
[camera shutter clicks]

895
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,304
It's like a billion stars.

896
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,572
No, I understand.

897
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:05,243
Okay, thank you, thanks
for letting me know.

898
00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:06,576
[Man] Don't worry, Cynthia.

899
00:52:06,643 --> 00:52:09,646
I'll put you back
in the spotlight.

900
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,917
[suspenseful music]

901
00:52:15,887 --> 00:52:18,089
[tense music]

902
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,158
[dramatic music]
[Dee screams]

903
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:55,558
What's the matter?

904
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:57,161
There's somebody out there.

905
00:52:57,228 --> 00:52:58,329
I saw him.

906
00:52:58,863 --> 00:53:00,530
Don't you look at me like that.

907
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,366
I saw him.

908
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,434
Is it the bad guy, Grandma?

909
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:06,603
Oh, no, it's not.

910
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:08,205
There's no bad guy.

911
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,673
I'm not crazy.

912
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,277
Grandma, are you okay?

913
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:14,644
Yes, sweetie.

914
00:53:15,712 --> 00:53:17,514
Hey, no, one's there.

915
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,216
It's just a shadow.

916
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:20,785
Come on, it's time to go to bed.

917
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,888
I've got a great story
for you guys.

918
00:53:26,991 --> 00:53:28,759
If this doesn't stop,
our son isn't gonna

919
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:31,095
let us see our
grandkids anymore.

920
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,830
Is that what you want?

921
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:34,065
Nope.

922
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,534
Dee.

[suspenseful music]

925
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,715
Anybody can locate me.

926
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:55,252
Please tell my son...

927
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,586
That I love him so much.

928
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:59,522
[tense music]

929
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:02,692
Locate me.

930
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,261
I don't know where I am.

931
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:06,130
Please, please.

932
00:54:06,197 --> 00:54:08,631
No!

933
00:54:08,698 --> 00:54:11,836
[keyboard clacking]

934

[tense music]

935
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:28,752
Now we have some really
sad news to report.

936
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:31,022
"Friday the 13th"
actress Tiffany Helm

937
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:33,623
was found stabbed to
death late last night

938
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,093
outside of her
Hollywood Hills home.

939
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,864
She was stabbed nine times
in the neck and abdomen,

940
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,733
and some reports are
even saying her head

941
00:54:43,801 --> 00:54:45,836
was completely severed.

942
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:49,040
Police haven't made any arrests
yet, but they are saying,

943
00:54:49,106 --> 00:54:51,409
it looks like she was
the victim of a stalker

944
00:54:51,475 --> 00:54:55,046
in which she was referred
to as her character's name,

945
00:54:55,112 --> 00:54:56,180
Violet.

946
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:57,982
Yeah, pretty creepy.

947
00:54:58,049 --> 00:55:00,117
Now of course, thoughts
and prayers go out

948
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:01,352
to Tiffany's family.

949
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:03,586
And you know guys, we
all love the films,

950
00:55:03,653 --> 00:55:06,123
the kills, the blood, the gore,

951
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,292
but when it's
happening in real life,

952
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:09,960
it can be pretty scary.

953
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:12,963
So stay safe out there and
let's hope that they can catch

954
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:16,067
whoever is responsible
for this very soon.

955

[text message dings]

956
00:55:23,474 --> 00:55:24,574
Hey, babe.

957
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:25,910
You need to wake up.

958
00:55:26,676 --> 00:55:27,945
Chris.

959
00:55:28,012 --> 00:55:29,080
Chris!

960
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:30,314
Come on.

961
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:31,449
Seriously?

962
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:34,218
[tense music]

963
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:42,259
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

[phone buzzing]

965
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:50,334
[Operator] What
is your emergency?

966
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:51,836
Hi, I need to report
a possible murder.

967
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:53,137
[Operator] What
is your address?

968
00:55:53,204 --> 00:55:55,139
No, it's my
friend, Dee Wallace.

969
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:57,341
I'm afraid something's
gonna happen to her.

970
00:55:57,408 --> 00:55:58,909
Kelsie Voorhees?

971
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:02,379
Is there an immediate threat
at Ms. Wallace's house?

972
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:03,981
Well, no, not that I know of,

973
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:05,382
but some really weird
things are happening and-

974
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,617
- Okay, if there is
an immediate threat,

975
00:56:07,684 --> 00:56:09,686
call back, we will
send a unit out there.

976
00:56:09,752 --> 00:56:13,090
Otherwise, you're welcome to
call the non-emergency number.

977
00:56:13,157 --> 00:56:14,525
I'm sure Detective
Evans will be happy

978
00:56:14,592 --> 00:56:16,193
to hear from you again.

979
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:18,362
Shit.

980
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:20,697
[tense music]

981
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:41,385
Grandma, I had a bad dream.

982
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:43,954
Uh-oh.

983
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:45,356
Come on.

984
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:48,592
Dreams aren't real, you know.

985
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:50,928
It feels real.

986
00:56:50,995 --> 00:56:54,532
Hey, you know where
I got this doll?

987
00:56:54,598 --> 00:56:56,400
This was my mommy's doll.

988
00:56:56,467 --> 00:57:00,938
And she gave it to me
when I was about your age.

989
00:57:01,738 --> 00:57:03,207
She's really pretty.

990
00:57:03,274 --> 00:57:04,542
Isn't she?

991
00:57:04,608 --> 00:57:06,443
Just like you.

992
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,912
Would you like to have her?

993
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:09,413
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

994
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,781
Okay.

995
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:15,718
Can we watch a funny movie?

996
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:17,321
Ah-ha.

997
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:21,926
I think this was all a ruse
to get to stay up later

998
00:57:21,992 --> 00:57:23,227
and watch a movie.

999
00:57:23,294 --> 00:57:25,129
Maybe!

1000
00:57:25,196 --> 00:57:26,764
Maybe.

1001
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:31,202
All right, let's see
what we can find.

1002
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:37,441
[phone ringing]
Hold on.

1003
00:57:39,476 --> 00:57:40,511
Hey, Kelsie.

1004
00:57:40,578 --> 00:57:41,744
It's a little late.

1005
00:57:41,812 --> 00:57:43,113
Got the kids this weekend.

1006
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,481
Okay, hi.

1007
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,383
Lock your doors, hide the
kids in the hiding place

1008
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,985
and get your gun and
point it at the door.

1009
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:49,853
If anyone comes through, fire.

1010
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:51,822
Oh my gosh.

1011
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:53,123
[Kelsie] What, what happened?

1012
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,593
All the electricity
just went out.

1013
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:56,961
Okay.

1014
00:57:57,027 --> 00:57:58,329
Someone cut the
electrical lines.

1015
00:57:58,395 --> 00:57:59,763
I am on my way.

1016
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,298
Kelsie, I saw him.

1017
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:03,300
Go, get your gun, now.

1018
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:06,237
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

1019
00:58:06,303 --> 00:58:07,638
Okay.

1020
00:58:07,705 --> 00:58:09,506
- All right, sweetheart.
- Grandma, what's going on?

1021
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:12,476
You and I are gonna go find
the safe place, remember?

1022
00:58:12,543 --> 00:58:13,978
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

1023
00:58:23,854 --> 00:58:25,222
Shh, it's okay.

- Come on, honey.
- What's going on?

1025
00:58:28,259 --> 00:58:31,161
We're gonna go down
to the safe place.

1026
00:58:31,228 --> 00:58:33,364
It's all right,
everything's fine.

1027
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,798
Hold on, wait!

1028
00:58:37,801 --> 00:58:39,270
What's going on?

1029
00:58:39,336 --> 00:58:41,438
Somebody cut the
electrical line.

1030
00:58:41,505 --> 00:58:42,539
- Cut?
- Yes.

1031
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,442
Dee, it's probably
just a fuse.

00:58:49,513 --> 00:58:52,249
[tense music]

1033
00:58:54,051 --> 00:58:55,452
I want Scout.

1034
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:57,988
I'm gonna keep him for
right now, sweetheart.

1035
00:58:58,055 --> 00:59:00,557
Go in and be very,
very quiet, right?

1036
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:03,127
No matter what,
you don't come out.

1037
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:04,361
Okay.

1038
00:59:04,428 --> 00:59:07,931

to go to the bathroom?

Oh, Dee, are you crazy?

Maybe.

1043
00:59:25,149 --> 00:59:27,484
But I'm not taking any chances.

1044
00:59:27,551 --> 00:59:28,752
Get behind me.

taking the kids out.

No you're not.

Just leave them where they are.

1048

You take 'em out of
there and you're wrong,

1049
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:41,832
we all could get killed.

1050
00:59:45,536 --> 00:59:46,805
You're gonna shoot me?

1051
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,472
If I have to.

1052
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:54,011
Just stay, get behind me.

- It's me.
- God, I coulda killed you.

Actually you shot a bird's
nest 30 feet above my head

1065

and 20 feet to the
right, I'm good.

I had to!

Sorry, Mom, you gave
Dad and I no other choice.

we've lost our grandkids.

- Sorry.
- Oh, you know better.

What is this?

I don't know.
Can you get it?

01:02:24,294 --> 01:02:26,029
I first saw you when I was 12.

1092
01:02:26,096 --> 01:02:28,031
I had a huge crush on you.

1093
01:02:28,098 --> 01:02:29,566
Could you sign my photo?

1094
01:02:29,633 --> 01:02:32,971
I've included $50 plus a
self-addressed stamped envelope.

1095
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:34,571
You're the coolest.

1096
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:37,876
Sincerely your number
one fan, Kenneth Casper."

1097
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:40,077
- I love real fans.
- Right?

1098
01:02:40,143 --> 01:02:41,846
Kinda creepy 'cause
it came to your house.

1099
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:43,280
Yeah, you think?

1100
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:47,518
Oh, but pretty roses.

1101
01:02:49,186 --> 01:02:51,789
[Kelsie] You want some tea?

1102
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:55,659
[tense music]

1103
01:03:06,169 --> 01:03:07,471
I'm so sorry.

1104
01:03:08,873 --> 01:03:11,475
Unfortunately, we don't
have a lot to go on.

1105
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:17,916
There was a piece
of my hair cut out

1106
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:19,616
in the middle of the night.

1107
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:21,819
I didn't cut it out.

1108
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:25,222
That means this fanboy,
he's not just watching me.

1109
01:03:25,289 --> 01:03:28,058
He's coming into my home.

1110
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:31,495
Why didn't he just kill me?

1111
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:36,733
If the guy is a
killer, he may get off

1112
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:39,003
on terrorizing his
victims before the kill.

1113
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:41,271
The way a cat
toys with a mouse.

1114
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:42,472
There's no signs
of forced entry

1115
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:44,943
on this floor or downstairs.

1116
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:46,577
You did keep
your doors locked?

1117
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:48,078
Of course.

1118
01:03:48,145 --> 01:03:49,881
Dee, we wish that there was
more that we could do, but-

1119
01:03:49,948 --> 01:03:52,282
- He broke into my home.

1120
01:03:52,349 --> 01:03:54,718
We're gonna send a squad
car around periodically,

1121
01:03:54,786 --> 01:03:56,153
keep an eye on the place.

1122
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,089
In the meantime, you
keep your doors locked

1123
01:03:59,156 --> 01:04:01,358
and your gun loaded.

1124
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:04,294
[suspenseful music]

1125
01:04:26,683 --> 01:04:29,653
Dee, I won't doubt
you again, okay?

1126
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,321
It's fine, really.

1127
01:04:38,963 --> 01:04:41,598
[knocking on door]

1128
01:04:46,169 --> 01:04:49,306
[knocking on door]

1129
01:04:50,273 --> 01:04:52,643
- Hey babe.
- Hello.

1130
01:04:53,577 --> 01:04:55,046
- How's it going?
- Good.

1131
01:04:55,113 --> 01:04:56,346
Missed you.

1132
01:04:57,381 --> 01:04:58,916
What happened to your hand?

1133
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:00,550
Oh.

1134
01:05:00,617 --> 01:05:02,020
Nothing, just burned on the
stove while I was cooking.

1135
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:03,153
Hey.

1136
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,421
- You must be Chris.
- Yeah.

1137
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:05,722
- Hi Dee.
- Hi, good to meet you.

1138
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:06,958
Nice to meet you.

1139
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:08,325
You're my first crush
when I was younger.

1140
01:05:08,392 --> 01:05:10,028
[laughs] Okay.

1141
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:12,462
Oh, shit, sorry, I didn't
mean to go all fanboy on you.

1142
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:13,563
That's okay, honey.

1143
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,066
Everybody's grown up on me.

1144
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,834
- Want a glass of wine?
- Yeah.

1145
01:05:16,901 --> 01:05:17,935
- You?
- Of course.

1146
01:05:18,002 --> 01:05:19,302
Yeah, of course.

1147
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:24,374
- Dee Wallace.
- What?

1148
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:27,210
You're such a nerd.

1149
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:29,713
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1150
01:05:29,781 --> 01:05:30,882
Not a chance.

1151
01:05:30,948 --> 01:05:32,582
Okay.

1152
01:05:32,649 --> 01:05:35,887
So you have to understand that
even though Kelsie's grandma

1153
01:05:35,953 --> 01:05:40,424
was a girly girl, she didn't
take shit from nobody.

1154
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:42,827
Oh, sounds familiar.

1155
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:47,197
Like this one time, we
stopped at this dance hall,

1156
01:05:47,264 --> 01:05:50,333
and this dude comes
over and he whispers

1157
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,469
something in her ear.

1158
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,873
Swear to God, she wouldn't
ever tell me what it was,

1159
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,876
but she said it was so bad
it would make a sailor blush.

1160
01:05:58,943 --> 01:06:02,780
By this time, a whole bunch
of people are coming through.

1161
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:05,582
She maneuvered around
to let them through

1162
01:06:05,649 --> 01:06:09,020
and she took her big
old stiletto heel,

1163
01:06:09,087 --> 01:06:10,955
buries it in this guy's arm.

1164
01:06:12,056 --> 01:06:13,724
And that's what he did.

1165
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,126
Exactly.

1166
01:06:15,193 --> 01:06:20,564
And she just dug that heel
right in until he yelped.

1167
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:24,267
She turned and said [gasps],
oh my god, I am so sorry.

1168
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,937
Oh, it was an accident.

1169
01:06:26,003 --> 01:06:27,471
I didn't mean to do that.

1170
01:06:27,537 --> 01:06:29,974
Nobody, nobody in
the whole place

1171
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,343
knew that she meant to do it,
that it wasn't an accident.

1172
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,611
She was something.

1173
01:06:34,678 --> 01:06:36,313
- One more.
- Oh no, no, no, no,

1174
01:06:36,379 --> 01:06:37,714
- Come on.
- No more.

1175
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:38,916
I'm going to bed.

1176
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:40,383
Boo.

1177
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,352
- Oh.
- Oh.

1178
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:44,188
[tense music]

1179
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:45,655
Oh, sorry.

1180
01:06:45,722 --> 01:06:47,759
I was hoping that you
would sign this for me.

1181
01:06:49,392 --> 01:06:51,294
Sure, yeah.

1182
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:53,563
Let me get my pen.

1183
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,332
Oh no, I got one right here.

1184
01:06:55,398 --> 01:06:56,768
Here you go.

1185
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,377
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1186
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:09,613
Awesome.
Thank you so much, Dee.

1187
01:07:11,149 --> 01:07:13,683
You remember to lock up.

1188
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:15,685
- Night.
- Night.

1189
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:17,687
- Love you.
- Love you

1190
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:22,026
Really?

1191
01:07:22,726 --> 01:07:23,761
Sorry.

1192
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:29,332
Last time, I promise.

1193
01:07:29,399 --> 01:07:31,334
[tense music]

1194
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:34,437
[clock ticking]

1195
01:07:35,405 --> 01:07:38,441
[water dripping]

1196
01:07:38,508 --> 01:07:41,378
[door creaking]

1197
01:07:43,815 --> 01:07:46,083
[tense music]

1198
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,994
Chris?

1199
01:07:59,864 --> 01:08:02,566
[tense music]

1200
01:08:04,434 --> 01:08:07,537
[computer beeping]

1201
01:08:14,477 --> 01:08:17,547
[tense music]

1202
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:22,019
[woman screaming]

1203
01:08:22,086 --> 01:08:25,089
[suspenseful music]

1204
01:08:27,758 --> 01:08:28,926
Ronnie.

1205
01:08:29,827 --> 01:08:31,361
Ronnie, wake up.

1206
01:08:33,396 --> 01:08:34,932
Wake up.

1207
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:37,034
[suspenseful music]

1208
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:09,133
Wake up.

1209
01:09:14,138 --> 01:09:15,172
Help me.

1210
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,775
Help me!

1211
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:20,011
Somebody help me!

1212
01:09:21,913 --> 01:09:23,147
Somebody help me!

1213
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:25,515
Kelsie, help me!

1214
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:27,051
Help me!

1215
01:09:27,118 --> 01:09:28,718
Oh! Kelsie!

1216
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:33,925
[Dee crying]
[suspenseful music]

1217
01:09:36,928 --> 01:09:38,561
Help me!

1218
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:40,331
It's okay.

1219
01:09:40,398 --> 01:09:42,767
[Dee crying]

1220
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,044
[tense music]

1221
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:06,257
[suspenseful music]

[Deborah shouting]

[Deborah crying]

1224
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:27,244
What?

1225
01:10:27,677 --> 01:10:29,512
I don't understand.

1226
01:10:29,914 --> 01:10:33,017
I wasn't there, I
swear, I wasn't there.

1227
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,685
How can that be?

1228
01:10:35,752 --> 01:10:37,520
I wasn't there.

1229
01:10:37,587 --> 01:10:39,622
- You killed her.
- What?

1230
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:41,624
- No, Kelsie.
- Why?

1231
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:43,260
She loved you.

1232
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:45,763
No, Kelsie, no, I would never
hurt her, you know that.

1233
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:51,102
I'm sorry, come on.

1234
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,070
I don't understand.

1235
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:55,106
I wasn't there.

1236
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:57,441
Don't do this, you
know I can't do this.

1237
01:10:57,507 --> 01:10:59,176
You have the right
to remain silent.

1238
01:10:59,243 --> 01:11:02,013
Lori, you know I
couldn't do this to Ronnie.

1239
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:03,680
Oh, don't do this.

1240
01:11:03,747 --> 01:11:05,383
Please don't do this.

1241
01:11:05,449 --> 01:11:07,018
Can and will be held
against you in a court of law.

1242
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:08,185
No!

1243
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:09,787
You have the right
to representation.

1244
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:12,522
If you cannot afford
it, one will be...

1245
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:16,526
[dramatic music]

1246
01:12:16,954 --> 01:12:20,324
Whoever killed
Deborah killed Ronnie.

1247
01:12:22,093 --> 01:12:24,161
And the video on my computer.

1248
01:12:24,228 --> 01:12:26,130
Please, I'm begging you.

1249
01:13:01,599 --> 01:13:04,235
[horn honking]

1250
01:13:07,338 --> 01:13:09,173
The right side of her
face has light on it,

1251
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,909
but there's no light
coming from the right side.

1252
01:13:11,976 --> 01:13:13,210
Only from the left.

1253
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,012
Now watch this.

1254
01:13:17,148 --> 01:13:18,482
- See it?
- See what?

1255
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:19,649
Okay.

1256
01:13:19,716 --> 01:13:21,051
Look again.

1257
01:13:23,954 --> 01:13:26,257
All I see is a slight glitch.

1258
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:27,391
It's not a glitch.

1259
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,861
There.

1260
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,234
- That a hand?
- And a part of a forearm.

1261
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:39,770
Someone not only superimposed
Dee in the video,

1262
01:13:39,837 --> 01:13:42,139
but they've covered
up the second killer.

1263
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,075
Look.

1264
01:13:45,142 --> 01:13:47,244
This is what Dee was
wearing on Saturday.

1265
01:13:52,183 --> 01:13:53,551
Look.

1266
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:56,287
[Man On Radio] Dispatch,
four-one-two, we got a wild one.

1267
01:13:57,388 --> 01:13:59,023
You gotta see this guy.

1268
01:14:00,658 --> 01:14:04,528
Found him in the woods
outside Miss Wallace's house.

1269
01:14:04,595 --> 01:14:07,031
Kelsie, Kelsie, baby, it's me.

1270
01:14:07,097 --> 01:14:08,866
Let them know I'm a
producer on "Bloodlust III."

1271
01:14:08,933 --> 01:14:10,234
I'm her producer.

1272
01:14:10,301 --> 01:14:12,735
I was just trying
to say hi to Kelsie

1273
01:14:12,803 --> 01:14:14,338
and meet Dee for the first time.

1274
01:14:14,405 --> 01:14:15,705
No big deal.

1275
01:14:15,773 --> 01:14:17,374
He had these in
his possession.

1276
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:20,544
Guy swears he paid a buddy
250 bucks for a pint of blood.

1277
01:14:20,611 --> 01:14:21,946
I did!

1278
01:14:22,012 --> 01:14:23,581
I did, I just wanted it
to be authentic looking.

1279
01:14:23,647 --> 01:14:26,150
You know, we're making a low
budget horror movie here.

1280
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:27,885
You know, you gotta
do what you gotta do.

1281
01:14:27,952 --> 01:14:30,654
Spare no expense, but
keep it within the budget.

1282
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,022
That's what I was taught.

1283
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:34,525
We just tested it
in the onsite lab.

1284
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:35,993
It's human.

1285
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,261
Now we're gonna test it
to see whether or not

1286
01:14:37,328 --> 01:14:39,196
it matches Miss
Wallace's husband.

1287
01:14:39,263 --> 01:14:41,999
[tense music]

1288
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:54,511
Thanks for bringing
me a change of clothes.

1289
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:56,080
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1290
01:14:56,814 --> 01:14:58,015
That's okay.

1291
01:14:58,082 --> 01:15:00,150
I was beginning
to suspect me too.

1292
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:02,519
Come on, let's go.

1293
01:15:04,388 --> 01:15:07,224
[solemn music]

1294
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:17,701
We don't wanna be in here.

1295
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,003
Why, what's wrong?

1296
01:15:19,069 --> 01:15:20,938
The house is bad.

1297
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,441
No, sweetheart.

1298
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:28,078
The house isn't bad.

1299
01:15:28,145 --> 01:15:30,581
Just something bad
happened in the house.

1300
01:15:30,648 --> 01:15:33,317
Will the bad man come back?

1301
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:37,354
Nope, they arrested
him and he's in jail.

1302
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:38,722
[Girl] For good?

1303
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:39,857
For good.

1304
01:15:39,923 --> 01:15:41,425
Do we have to stay in?

1305
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,129
No, you go play.

1306
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,769
Maybe the kids have a point.

1307
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:52,236
Maybe you should move.

1308
01:15:52,603 --> 01:15:53,837
What?

1309
01:15:53,904 --> 01:15:55,472
Maybe you should move.

1310
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,075
Not a chance.

1311
01:15:59,443 --> 01:16:02,379
You know how many memories
there are of Ronnie

1312
01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:05,784
and you kids in this house?

1313
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:10,821
I'm not gonna let some psychopath
run me out of my own home.

1314
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:25,736
[door closes]

1315
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:27,338
Oh my gosh.

1316
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:29,373
You both came.

1317
01:16:35,646 --> 01:16:37,481
I am so sorry, Dee.

1318
01:16:37,548 --> 01:16:38,882
Ronnie.

1319
01:16:38,949 --> 01:16:40,417
Ronnie was amazing.

1320
01:16:40,484 --> 01:16:41,852
What can we do for you?

1321
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:43,420
We're here for you.

1322
01:16:43,487 --> 01:16:44,988
We'll be in town to help,
anything you need done.

1323
01:16:45,055 --> 01:16:46,857
Where are you staying?

1324
01:16:46,924 --> 01:16:48,092
We have rooms in the town.

1325
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:51,095
Oh, please stay here.

1326
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:53,464
I really need my
friends around me.

1327
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,199
Yes, yes, yes.

1328
01:16:59,903 --> 01:17:01,305
I'm so sorry.

1329
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:04,341
I hope they string
the bastard up.

1330
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,950
[clock ticking]

1331
01:17:23,127 --> 01:17:25,830
So have the cops
arrested anybody yet?

1332
01:17:25,896 --> 01:17:28,198
Yeah, he hasn't
been charged yet.

1333
01:17:28,265 --> 01:17:29,933
He was caught outside
though, with human blood

1334
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,536
and a machete, so, I'm sure.

1335
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:35,005
Hey.

1336
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,410
Oh guys, come on.

1337
01:17:39,476 --> 01:17:42,546
Don't have to walk on pins
and needles around me.

1338
01:17:42,613 --> 01:17:43,914
Sorry.

1339
01:17:48,986 --> 01:17:50,287
You know...

1340
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,325
Could I ask you guys to just

1341
01:17:56,527 --> 01:18:00,964
gather Ron's clothes
and the pictures,

1342
01:18:01,031 --> 01:18:03,634
put 'em up in the
attic for me tomorrow.

1343
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:08,038
I just really don't want
to see anything right now.

1344
01:18:08,972 --> 01:18:10,040
Can you do that for me?

1345
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:11,776
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1346
01:18:11,843 --> 01:18:14,378
Thank you for
everything today.

Sorry.

01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:41,940
Tracie Savage is in
town and she wants me

1357
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:44,441
to meet her for
dinner tomorrow night.

1358

She doesn't know?

01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:49,346
I didn't think to call her.

No.

1366
01:19:22,246 --> 01:19:24,615
Weird, they're telling
me to check your phone?

1367

Well, I've always
got it on silent.

- What?

- But there wasn't any DNA-
- Come on.

For the blood, it was
human, but it really

What?

Don't worry, you
won't miss a thing.

1507
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:20,137

- Oh, come on.

[drill whirring]

1521
01:31:19,196 --> 01:31:21,098
[Judie] All right, we'll
start with an easy one.

1522
01:31:21,165 --> 01:31:24,535
What is the name of the location

1523
01:31:24,602 --> 01:31:25,936
of "Friday the 13th Part V?"

1524
01:31:26,837 --> 01:31:28,272
I don't know.

1525
01:31:29,473 --> 01:31:32,209
I played one role in part three.

1526
01:31:32,276 --> 01:31:34,378
I didn't even see
the other movies.

1527
01:31:36,146 --> 01:31:38,449
That's a wrong answer,
because it's Pinehurst.

1528
01:31:38,515 --> 01:31:40,384
What? No.

1529
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:43,520
What is the name
of the cemetery

1530
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:48,392
that the killer is
buried in in Part Six?

1531
01:31:48,826 --> 01:31:50,394
That wasn't my answer.

1532
01:31:51,295 --> 01:31:52,363
- Wrong.
- Oh God.

1533
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:58,369
It's the Eternal
Peace Cemetery.

1534
01:31:59,403 --> 01:32:00,704
Please.

1535
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:02,039
Stop.

1536
01:32:03,474 --> 01:32:04,742
I got one.

1537
01:32:04,808 --> 01:32:06,210
All right.

1538
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:08,245
Who did the producers
get to play the killer

1539
01:32:08,312 --> 01:32:11,982
in "Friday the 13th Part II?"

1540
01:32:12,049 --> 01:32:13,484
Steve Dash.

1541
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:14,652
Whoa.

1542
01:32:14,718 --> 01:32:15,753
You didn't let me finish.

1543
01:32:15,819 --> 01:32:17,121
Oh, come on.

1545

I don't know.

1546
01:32:22,726 --> 01:32:24,194
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

1547
01:32:24,895 --> 01:32:26,330
Well, then that's wrong again.

1548
01:32:26,397 --> 01:32:27,498
Oh God.

1549
01:32:27,564 --> 01:32:29,233
That's three wrong
and zero right.

1550
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,670
Whoa, you really
suck at this game.

1551
01:32:32,736 --> 01:32:34,071
- Please stop.
- You know?

1552
01:32:34,138 --> 01:32:36,340

like this, he's...

Tell me, what kind of power tool

1557
01:32:50,387 --> 01:32:52,256
was used as a
weapon by the killer

1558
01:32:52,323 --> 01:32:56,694
in "Friday the 13th Part VII."

1559
01:32:56,761 --> 01:32:57,995

Oh.

1562

She got one.

1563
01:33:02,366 --> 01:33:05,436
- Ha ha, wow.
- That's impressive.

1564
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:09,506
So that's three
wrong, one right?

1565
01:33:09,573 --> 01:33:10,641
See if you can keep this up.

1566
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:12,109
Oh, please.

1567
01:33:14,912 --> 01:33:16,246
Okay.

1568
01:33:16,313 --> 01:33:21,518
In "Jason Goes to Hell,"
who dragged that mask

1569
01:33:23,654 --> 01:33:26,023
all the way back to hell?

1570
01:33:26,423 --> 01:33:27,958
Freddy Krueger?

1571
01:33:31,261 --> 01:33:32,629
Is that a question?

1572
01:33:34,799 --> 01:33:36,066
Is that a question?

1573
01:33:36,133 --> 01:33:37,601
That's a guess.

1574
01:33:38,469 --> 01:33:40,904
- I'll give it to you.
- Fuck.

1575
01:33:42,841 --> 01:33:45,175
- Again, more.
- Okay.

What's the name
of the cruise ship

High get on to go to Manhattan?

[Tracie] I have no idea.

1579
