Yep, yep.

00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,480
All right, all right.

4
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,068
Lee, why don't you
come to my office

5
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:03,208
and we can discuss the
additional coverage.

6
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:07,143
You can set up a date with
one of my secretaries,

7
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:08,386
either Candy or Donna.

8
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:10,180
Okay.

9
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:13,183
All right, bye.

Oh, hi Benji.

12
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,888
Hi Candy.

13
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:30,304
Hi Donna.

14
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,409
Oh, hey Benji.

15
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,275
My, but you girls
look lovely today.

16
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,276
Thank you.

17
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,416
Candy.

18
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,107
Here's the Henderson file.

19
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:42,661
- Thanks, Donna.
- You're welcome.

20
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,457
Oh, kitty cats.

21
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,252
I love kitty cats.

22
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,598
I had one once.

23
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,599
Oh, that's nice.

24
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,602
He got squished by a car.

25
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:53,431
That's not.

26
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,192
Yeah.

27
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,126
Oh, he's off the phone now,

28
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,438
You can go in, Benji.

29
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:04,062
Oh, thank you, Donna.

30
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:04,925
You're welcome.

[soft music]

32
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:12,070
Keep them out of the street.

33
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,727
No worries.

34
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,866
They're indoor cats.

36
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,500
Hey Benji.

37
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:29,501
Hi Danny.

38
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,916
Hey, wanna go to lunch?

39
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:34,023
Daisy's Deli has that
turkey sausage sandwich

40
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:35,507
for special today.

41
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,267
You know the one with the

42
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,304
fried green peppers
and the onions.

43
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:44,654
I may have to pass.

44
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,277
Heartburn, I think.

45
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,140
Oh.

46
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,212
You're still getting that.

47
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,630
About a month
now of off and on.

48
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:55,493
Mm.

49
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,669
Protonics.

50
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,465
I keep telling you, Danny,

51
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,949
I've been taking
that stuff for years

52
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:05,882
and I can eat anything I want.

53
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,678
That's what you
keep telling me.

54
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,440
Protonics.

55
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:14,546
I'm telling you it,

56
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:17,860
it's much better than any of
that over the counter stuff.

57
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:19,206
And the important thing,

58
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:21,795
diarrhea.

59
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:25,971
What?

60
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:26,834
None.

61
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,561
Not a drop.

62
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,153
Well, you won't get
it from taking it.

63
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,190
Well, thank you for
that very descriptive

64
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:39,260
piece of information.

65
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:42,436
Let's do it another day.

66
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:46,682
Oh, alright.

67
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:51,687
Thursday.

68
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:52,515
We'll see.

69
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,381
Okay.

00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,901
[tense music]

71
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,474
[Daniel] Are you okay?

72
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:23,684
What?

73
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:29,863
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

74
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:35,869
Oh, okay.

75
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,698
Well I better go.

76
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:41,599
See ya

77
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,462
Thursday.

78
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,982
[soft music]

79
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:09,143
You know, when we were at
Andrew Farnsworth's funeral,

80
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,663
his wife told me that he
had complained of discomfort

81
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,665
in his abdomen for
a very long time

82
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,219
and just kept putting
off seeing the doctor.

83
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:18,014
Just like you, dad.

84
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,464
How come you only speak

85
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,777
when you want to point
out other people's flaws?

86
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,054
Where did you learn that?

87
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:24,987
It's whiter.

88
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,750
You really need to set up
some guidelines at that place.

89
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,027
Are you still
getting those pains?

90
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:33,513
It's heartburn,
doesn't last long,

91
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,514
goes away in minutes.

92
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,860
But it keeps coming back.

93
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,447
You too?

94
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:40,002
Maybe that's why you don't
enjoy life as much as I do.

95
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,142
No, it's because
I'm older than you.

96
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,178
And I know what's really
happening in the world

97
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:45,628
while you and your generation

98
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,630
are the first to
complain and last to act.

99
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,390
That's not fair.

100
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,151
I'll tell you what's not fair,

101
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,878
living as long as I have
and knowing what I know

102
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,501
based on years of experience

103
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,607
and being looked at
by younger people

104
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,470
as if all of that
doesn't mean a thing.

105
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,196
- Daniel.
- Okay.

106
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,095
I'll have it checked out.

107
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,648
I can make an appointment
for you with Dr. Marshall.

108
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:07,029
No, I'll, I'll do it.

109
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,306
You said that last time.

110
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,032
Didn't you say you
had somewhere to be?

111
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,172
No, my shift doesn't
start til late.

112
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,242
Shift?

113
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:14,933
You got a paying job?

114
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,003
I volunteer.

115
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:16,866
As what?

116
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:17,729
A grief counselor.

117
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,214
For what?

118
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,664
For people having a hard time

119
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,218
coping with the final
season of "Game of Thrones".

120
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:27,739
["Game of Thrones" theme]

121
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,194
It's not funny.

122
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,713
You'd be surprised
how many people

123
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,025
get severely traumatized
if their favorite TV show

124
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,820
doesn't end the way
they expect it to.

125
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,304
Like "Breaking Bad",

126
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,720
final season perfect.

00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,104
It's not funny.

129
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:48,933
Yes it is.

130
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,520
Look,

131
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,351
if you had to watch one TV
show in your entire life,

132
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,767
it would for sure
be "Breaking Bad".

133
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,493
Everybody knows that.

134
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,599

[tense music]

136
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,267
Ever since Bernie died,

137
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,407
it's been hard for me to
keep things organized.

138
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:18,687
That's why I'm glad
you're helping me

139
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,999
make the more
difficult decisions.

140
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,138
Bernie used to do all that.

141
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,175
Well, he was good at it.

142
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:29,076
So if you think I need this
extra insurance, then I do.

143
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:32,770
Well, it's your decision,
Mrs. Loomis, as always.

144
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:35,186
But I think it's better
to be safe than sorry.

145
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,566
I mean, whatever
you say, Daniel.

146
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,775
I trust your judgment.

147
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:41,192
I mean, you're so good at this.

148
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,814
It must have been
your calling in life.

149
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,127
An insurance agent?

150
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,338
Could all be
part of God's plan.

151
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,581
Well, I don't know about that.

152
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,964
Well, either way,
there's still time.

153
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:55,758
Sometimes we

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,004
have to go through a
lot in our lives before

155

it's revealed to us.

like a young man.

I ever told you that?

[giggling]

372
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,472
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,129
Well, what's he
doing in Bethany?

374
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,924
He has an opening this
afternoon at 3:00 p.m.

375
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,547
So I grabbed it.

376
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,413
His office is off route
88 at 1619 Wilber Road.

377
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:26,448
Don't be late.

378
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:29,037
Wait, wait, wait 3:00 p.m.

379
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,866
That's so last minute.

380
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,903
Daniel, just leave
the office early.

381
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,214
You are the boss.

382
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:35,250
Okay.

383
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:36,113
Okay.

384
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,394
All right, gimme
the address again.

385
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,708
It's off route 88
at 1619 Wilber Road.

386
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:46,537
Okay.

387
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:47,814
Bye sweetie.

388
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:48,677
Bye.

00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,726
May I help you?

392
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:40,142
Yes, I have an
appointment with Dr. Hajia.

9824.

399
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,755
Going once,

400
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:54,760
going twice.

401
00:25:55,484 --> 00:26:00,248

9825.

403

Going once,

9826.

407
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,136
Did you make the appointment?

408
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,965
No, my wife did.

409
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,863
Daniel Adams?

410
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:30,105
Yes.

411
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,900
Have a seat, I'll
call your name.

413
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:52,852
Okay.

414
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:01,067
Daniel Adams.

415
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,036
Daniel Adams.

416
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:14,046

with you in a minute.

00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:29,673
How are you my friend?

424
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,952
Well, I would say fine, but,

425
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:34,747
and I wouldn't be here, would I?

426
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:40,097
Oh, oh, a joke.

427
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,374
Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:42,272

429
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,204
I love it.

430
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:46,966

[lively music]

432
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,353
It's not on your tablet there?

433
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:58,771
Oh, you are Dr. Hajia?

434
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,915
No, that's me.

Humor.

437
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,195
Yes.

438
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,058
I know.

439
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:17,928
I'm Daniel Adams.

440
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:19,343
Like the beer?

441
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,070
No, that's Samuel Adams.

442
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:24,245
A very good, very good.

443
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:29,871
And so you tell the
nurse, you have pain?

444
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:30,734
Yes.

445
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:33,047
Yes.

446
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,911
I mean, it comes
and goes, but it's,

447
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,533
it's been getting worse lately.

448
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,603
In the butt?

449
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,159
No.

450
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:44,127
In the chest?

451
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:44,990
Where?

452
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:46,474
Not, not exactly.

453
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:47,855
Kind of in the middle.

454
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,167
Hm.

455
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:56,173
Open mouth please.

456
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,349
Hm.

459
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:11,913
Deep breath please.

460
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,503
Deeper.

461
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,126
Deeper.

462
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,233
Three times.

463
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:30,000
Hmm.

464
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:32,692
Cough, please.

465
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,733
We need blood.

466
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,738
Oh, I'm afraid

467
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:45,844
I'm gonna need a little
help getting that out.

468
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,433
Oh, oh, humor.

469
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:50,503
Yes.

470
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:51,746
- Very good, very good.
- Yes.

471
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,713
And the nurse will be
in to take your blood

472
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:55,543
and then we see.

473
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:56,371
Yes?

00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:58,511
[soft music]

475
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:10,040
If you are really Samuel Adams,

476
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,179
she.

477
00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:13,285

478
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:15,114
She.

[laughs]

480
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:19,118
She could.

481
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,258
[laughs]

482
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,090
She,

483
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:27,920
[laughs]

484
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:28,748
she could.

485
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:29,680
[laughs]

486
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:31,682
She could take your beer.

490
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:13,828
You know, doc,

491
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,519
you really should take your
job a little more serious.

492
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,766
Humor, yes?

493
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,354
No.

494
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,596
No?

495
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:27,221
Have you recently
been bitten by an insect

496
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:30,120
that maybe you are
not familiar with?

497
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:30,949
An insect?

498
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,159
No, not that I know of at least.

499
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:36,609
Coughing, shortness of breath,

500
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:38,887
blood where it shouldn't be?

501
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:41,614
Where it shouldn't be?

502
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:43,823
No.

503
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,654
What's going on doc?

504
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:49,864
Well, I, I don't want
you to alarm your wife

505
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:51,866
or your family.

506
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,903
Just the tests we did
revealed something.

507
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:57,976
What, I mean, revealed what?

508
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,082
Have you ever heard of Ebola?

509
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:02,877
Pneumonic plague?

510
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,499
Dengue?

511
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:05,362
Hemorat,

512
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,502
hemorrhagic infection?

513
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,471
No, none of those.

514
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,024
Why?

515
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,406
Which one of those
things do I have?

516
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,579
What have I got?

517
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:17,443
It's early,

518
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,066
but there's something there.

519
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:21,309
Where?

520
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:22,379
Something where?

521
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,036
It's early.

522
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:27,005
Is that why it took so long?

523
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,835
Or which of those things is it?

524
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,595
It's early.

525
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,528
You keep saying that.

526
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:35,254
Well, more tests maybe.

527
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:39,948
I think I need to send the
blood for more tests to be sure.

528
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:43,021
Oh wait doc,
you can't do this.

529
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,023
You have to tell me.

530
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:45,989
You don't know me.

531
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,991
I'll go crazy.

532
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,338
The waiting could be
worse than the diagnosis.

533
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:53,272
Is this serious?

534
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:54,308
Is it?

535
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:55,930
Well,

536
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:58,795
I don't believe in not telling
the truth to my patients.

537
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,623
I understand.

538
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:00,762
They need to know, yes.

539
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:01,556
Yes.

540
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:03,593
I mean, absolutely yes.

541
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:08,632
So you're saying it's
something serious

542
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,669
and you want to do more tests

543
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:13,396
and you don't want me
to tell my family yet.

544
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,674
Yes and no.

545
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,538
How serious?

546
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,780
Serious.

547
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:22,853
Like fatal serious?

548
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:24,993
I mean, like I
could die serious?

549
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:26,616
It's early.

550
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,342
I got that part.

551
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:31,690
How serious doc?

552
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:33,209
Come on.

553
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:36,557
Daniel, there's a good chance
you have a terminal illness

554
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:40,388
that could result in death
in a short period of time.

555
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:43,081
[serious music]

556
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,362
Look, my nurse will call you

557
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,846
when we get the results

558
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,747
and you will have to come back
and see me very soon, yes.

559
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,785
[serious music]

560
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:05,206
Doc.

561
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,105
How long?

562
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,797
Three weeks, okay.

563
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,454
Maybe less, but

564
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,803
I will do everything in
my power to help you.

565
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:17,494
You will just have to come back

566
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:20,118
and see me very soon, my friend.

567
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:20,980
Yes?

568
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:24,501
It's early.

569
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:27,159
[serious music]

570
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,143
Three weeks,

571
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,076
maybe less

572
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:55,463
Ebola.

573
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:59,157
Pneumonic plague.

574
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:01,711
Denny's mathematic infection.

575
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:04,748
I've never heard
of any of those.

576
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:06,164
Oh, maybe Ebola.

577
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,168
[serious music]

578
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:14,172
Three weeks.

579
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,933
[serious music]

580
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:18,822
There's a good chance you
have a terminal illness.

581
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,034
Three weeks, okay.

582
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,966
Three weeks.

583
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:29,833
You don't want me to
tell my family yet?

584
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:32,250
I better not say
anything to Becca.

585
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,253
It's early.

586
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,945
[serious music]

587
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:46,471
Well?

588
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,439
Well what.

589
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:50,751
Dr. Hajia, how was he?

590
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:52,615
It's

591
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:54,962
early.

592
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,101
What did he say?

593
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,137
It's early.

594
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:00,450
What's early?

595
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:03,142
That, that's what he said.

596
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,661
He took some blood.

597
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:06,939
He's gonna run some
tests and get back to me.

598
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:07,871
[doorbell ringing]

599
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,079
That's probably the pizza.

600
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:11,703
Pizza?

601
00:38:11,737 --> 00:38:12,635
I figured he might be a
little late getting home.

602
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,844
So I ordered one.

603
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,160
Hi, Chloe.

604
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:22,817
[Chloe] Hi Benji.

605
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:24,681
I didn't know you
delivered pizzas.

606
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:25,855
How wonderful.

607
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,478
Yeah, for about a month now.

608
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:30,584
Benji, I knew you got a
job at the pizza place,

609
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:32,482
but didn't know you delivered.

610
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:33,311
Yeah.

611
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,727
Hi Danny.

612
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,211
[Becca] How.

613
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,730
[Benji] How, what?

614
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:40,835
[Becca] You don't have a car.

615
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,698
My bike.

616
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:58,508
Too many right turns.

617
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,582
Maybe you can hold
it at an angle

618
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:04,894
and then that way it all just

619
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,207
all just shift right
back into place.

620
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:09,485
Don't worry about it.

621
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,659
We'll make due. How
much do we owe you?

622
00:39:11,694 --> 00:39:14,559
Oh, $26.97.

623
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:16,423
That's with delivery.

624
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:17,285
Oh.

625
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:21,220
Thank you, Rebecca.

626
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:23,671
[soft music]

627
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,020
Did he say bike?

628
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:35,890
[bell ringing]

629
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,756
Beverly?

630
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:40,964
Yeah.

631
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,552
Oh, don't worry though.

632
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:44,899
Next time, I'll take
a different route.

633
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,559
One with little fewer
right hand turns.

634
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,632
[soft music]

635
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:55,462
Bye Benji.

636
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,051

637
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,503

640
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,905
[Becca] Daniel!

641
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,941
What?

642
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:02,011
It's early.

643
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,840
We already established that.

644
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,703
What?

645
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:07,603
Wait, what?

646
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:10,606
The clock hasn't rung yet.

647
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,228
Do you wanna get up?

648
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:15,956
Oh, I, yeah.

649
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:18,890
Couldn't really sleep.

650
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:19,753
Bad night.

651
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,963
You all right?

652
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,171
Was it the pain again?

653
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:25,828
No, no, no.

654
00:41:25,862 --> 00:41:27,899
Just couldn't sleep.

655
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:31,419
[soft music]

656
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:54,995
Do you remember the
time we first met?

657
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,069
Of course,

658
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:03,141
1987, the church picnic.

659
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,149
You're just as beautiful
now as you were then.

660
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:17,604
I used to tease you.

661
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:21,435
Called you a holy roller,

662
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:23,471
'cause you were always
trying to please God,

663
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:29,547
always reading and
quoting the Bible.

664
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:37,106
It was so important
to you back then.

665
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,141
It still is.

666
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:39,971
Yeah, I know.

667
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,492
I love you.

668
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:45,701
I love you too.

669
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:54,986
Candy.

670
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:01,371
Yes?

671
00:43:01,406 --> 00:43:03,373
Any calls from
Dr. Hajia's office?

672
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:05,237
Not since the
last time you asked.

673
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:08,620
That was only five
minutes ago, wasn't it?

674
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:10,208
Yes, it was.

675
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:12,728
Well you have a
remarkable memory.

676
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:13,660
Yes I do.

677
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,802
What?

678
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:20,045
I'm gonna to go to lunch.

679
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,460
Is 9:45.

680
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:25,741
Brunch then.

681
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:28,709
Okay.

682
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:29,883
But what are you
going to be back?

683
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:32,195
I don't know.

684
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:35,958
- I don't know?
- Okay.

685
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:36,993
- Okay.
- So $5.

686
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:39,893
But where is this place?

687
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:42,516
[gentle music]

688
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:28,217
This is kinda like the
day before a colonoscopy,

689
00:44:29,977 --> 00:44:31,427
spending every minute terrified

690
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,119
they'll find something in
between all the bathroom runs.

691
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:38,503
Except this time,

692
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:39,815
you won't be waking
up afterwards

693
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,402
to see if they found something.

694
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:51,343
[soft music]

695
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:17,576
Excuse me.

696
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:18,439
Excuse me, sir.

697
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:21,477
Can I ask you a question?

698
00:45:23,582 --> 00:45:25,999
You look like you may not
have a lot of time left.

699
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:35,733
Although you look really
great for your age.

700
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,979
But I mean, obviously you
have less time ahead of you

701
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:42,049
than behind you.

702
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:46,536
You know, when the
time comes, you know,

703
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:48,228
when you find out you have to go

704
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:51,679
or exactly when
you're going to go,

705
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,650
what do you do with
the time you have left,

706
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:57,513
whatever it is?

707
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,930
[soft music]

708
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:06,142
Probably watch all six
seasons of "Breaking Bad".

["Breaking Bad" theme song]
[piano music]

710
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,410
[knocking on door]

711
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:38,105
Hi mom.

712
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,935
Daniel, why
aren't you at work?

713
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:44,215
Can I come in?

714
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:47,908
[soft music]

715
00:46:59,092 --> 00:47:00,610
Who died?

716
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:01,922
What?

717
00:47:01,957 --> 00:47:03,959
Why would you say that?

718
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:06,513
You come to see me in
the middle of a weekday?

719
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:08,135
No phone call,

720
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:08,998
no gift.

721
00:47:09,033 --> 00:47:09,999
What else could it be?

722
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:13,831
Maybe I just
wanted to see you.

723
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,349
Fat chance.

724
00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:16,972
Mom.

725
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:19,008
The last time you
came to see me like this

726
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:21,873
was when you and Rebecca got
pregnant for the first time.

727
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:24,738
Why did people say that?

728
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:25,739
Say what?

729
00:47:25,773 --> 00:47:27,706
Me and Becca.

730
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:29,018
We.

731
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:29,985
We didn't get pregnant.

732
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:30,882
She did.

733
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:34,058
Oh my.

734
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:35,956
So Chloe's not your daughter?

735
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:39,132
No.

736
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,754
Did you just find out?

737
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:41,997
No.

738
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:44,654
I mean, yes, Chloe
is my daughter.

739
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:45,483
Dylan?

740
00:47:45,517 --> 00:47:46,656
No, no, no, no.

741
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:47,865
That's not what I meant.

742
00:47:49,314 --> 00:47:51,144
I don't know why
people say that,

743
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:53,663
we didn't get pregnant.

744
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:55,251
She.

745
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:56,666
Nevermind.

746
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:58,530
It's not why I'm here.

747
00:47:58,565 --> 00:48:00,291
Something has happened

748
00:48:00,325 --> 00:48:02,120
or is happening to me and

749
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:06,814
well, I have something that
I really like to tell you.

750
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:07,815
Okay.

751
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,472
Ever since I found out,

752
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:12,096
I've been seeing things from
a different perspective,

753
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:16,859
you know, the sun,
the sky, the flowers.

754
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,966
I mean, I look around
my house differently,

755
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,244
everything and the rooms,

756
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:24,453
the furniture,

757
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:25,937
color and the walls.

758
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:29,837
And it what, makes
you wanna redecorate?

759
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:32,288
I watched Becca last
night as she was sleeping,

760
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:34,670
thinking how
beautiful she was and

761
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:38,432
how much it's gonna
hurt when I tell her.

762
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:41,815
I really need to tell someone.

763
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:44,818
I thought being my mother, that

764
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:48,787
if I was gonna tell someone
that you should be the first.

765
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:52,412
Well Daniel,
honey I understand.

766
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,694
And I am so glad you decided
to share this with me first.

767
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:00,696
Thanks mom.

768
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,629
I don't know what brought
this on at your age,

769
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:07,082
but it's a different world
with the internet and all.

770
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:07,945
Oh yeah.

771
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:11,949
Does Rebecca suspect anything?

772
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,573
Mm, no, I don't think so.

773
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,991
Although I have probably
been acting a little funny

774
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:21,061
since I found out.

775
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:23,270
Have you been walking funny?

776
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,203
What?

777
00:49:25,238 --> 00:49:27,171
To be honest, Daniel,

778
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:29,242
I should have seen this coming.

779
00:49:29,276 --> 00:49:32,693
Do you remember when
you were 11 years old

780
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:35,765
and I caught you trying
on your sister's dress?

781
00:49:37,422 --> 00:49:40,322
I just thought it was
an innocent curiosity.

782
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:42,082
Oh, you mean the
Halloween costume?

783
00:49:42,117 --> 00:49:45,775
And you did play with your
sister's cabbage patch dolls

784
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,294
a little too much.

785
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:49,193
You mean the ones that
I was gonna sell for her?

786
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,815
It's okay, Daniel.

787
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,131
But I think it's important
that you tell Rebecca

788
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:57,649
as soon as possible

789
00:49:57,684 --> 00:50:00,514
while she still has a few
good years left in her.

790
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:02,033
The kids won't care.

791
00:50:02,068 --> 00:50:04,415
Nowadays, everything's
okay with them.

792
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:08,212
It's okay, honey.

793
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:11,905
Hate the sin, love the sinner.

794
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:13,217
Huh?

795
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:14,839
Now you just sit there

796
00:50:14,873 --> 00:50:19,085
and be whatever
or whoever you are

797
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,810
and I'll go make some tea.

798
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,816
Ellen comes on at three.

799
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:29,267
[soft music]

800
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:37,689
Bad idea.

801
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,555
[lively music]

802
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:51,807
Do you wanna go see Daniel?

803
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,912
Do you have to poopy?

804
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:54,741
Good.

805
00:50:55,776 --> 00:50:56,570
Daniel?

806
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:00,091
[lively music]

807
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:06,166
Well, that was a little
rude, don't you think.

808
00:51:07,236 --> 00:51:09,618
[soft music]

809
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:20,560
We're good, right?

810
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,919
You know, I never did
explore other religions.

811
00:51:34,953 --> 00:51:37,094
I wonder if one's any
better than the other.

812
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,306
Maybe they know something
the others don't.

813
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,618
[doorbell ringing]

814
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:47,034
[soft music]

815
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:53,248
Hello.

816
00:51:56,596 --> 00:52:00,013
We are from the Church of Jesus
Christ of Modern Day Saints.

817
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,189
Do you belong to a church?

818
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:05,225
Yes.

819
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,985
My wife attends
Bethany Baptist church

820
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,918
and I go when I can.

821
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:10,506
I heard that that's
a very nice church.

822
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:11,956
Yeah.

823
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,233
Guys,

824
00:52:13,268 --> 00:52:15,511
I just got home from work and

825
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:17,651
I'm really not feeling
that good right now.

826
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:20,482
We understand.

827
00:52:22,277 --> 00:52:23,105
Thanks.

828
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:29,111
We just wanted to make
sure you are good with God.

829
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,321
My name is Daniel.

830
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:08,150
I'm elder Jones.

831
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,394
I'm elder Wallace.

832
00:53:10,428 --> 00:53:11,843
It would seem
that I'd be the one

833
00:53:11,878 --> 00:53:13,328
carrying that title here.

834
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:17,746
Yes, it would appear that way.

835
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,475
So do you have first names
or did you have to lose those?

836
00:53:22,509 --> 00:53:25,271
We prefer the elder title
and then our last names.

837
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:29,516
Well, it feels a
little awkward, but okay.

838
00:53:31,863 --> 00:53:33,969
Could I call you
Wallace and Jones maybe?

839
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,491
- Sure.
- Sure.

840
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:44,221
So did you see that play,

841
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:45,498
the Book of Mormon?

842
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:47,154
You know the one by
the South Park guys.

843
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:47,983
Oh.

844
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:49,916
[laughs]

845
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:50,848
Funny.

846
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:53,230
Yeah, pretty funny.

847
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,438
You saw it?

848
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:55,680
Yes.

849
00:53:55,715 --> 00:53:57,095
We may have lost
our first names,

850
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,925
but not our sense of humor.

851
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:00,202
Of course.

852
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:06,691
So you guys out
recruiting today?

853
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:10,488
We don't recruit.

854
00:54:10,523 --> 00:54:12,145
We are missionaries.

855
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,767
Oh, sorry.

856
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:17,461
I thought that's what you
guys, you know, the Mormons do.

857
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:18,738
Yes, we know.

858
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:28,817
So Wallace, what did you
mean by me being okay with God?

859
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,060
Well, if you don't
mind me saying,

860
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:33,960
you look like a troubled soul.

861
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,896
Well, I just
found out something

862
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,863
that could affect
my whole future,

863
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:43,866
or what's left of it.

864
00:54:45,454 --> 00:54:47,145
Something bad?

865
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,008
Could be.

866
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,979
Are you guys okay
or, or good with God?

867
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:57,224
Well, I think I can speak
on behalf of elder Jones

868
00:54:57,259 --> 00:54:59,779
when I say yes, we are.

869
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:01,436
So hypothetically,

870
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,576
if you were to die,
let's say in three weeks.

871
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,680
Three weeks?

872
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:06,268
Yes, three weeks to live.

873
00:55:07,787 --> 00:55:09,167
Are you sure that when you die,

874
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,100
you're going to be with God?

875
00:55:11,135 --> 00:55:15,242
Well, I think I can speak
on behalf of elder Jones

876
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:17,693
when I say yes, we are.

877
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,281
Well, I didn't know if it
was any different for you,

878
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,146
you know, being that you guys
have your own book and all,

879
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,736
you know, maybe, you know
something the others don't

880
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,153
and that gives you
more of like a,

881
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:32,708
a backstage pass,
you know, all access.

882
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:38,956
Heaven's not a
rock concert, Daniel.

883
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,578
I know, I know.

884
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:43,443
What I meant was

885
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:46,757
do Mormons know something
other religions don't

886
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:50,036
that might make it more of
a sure thing when one dies?

887
00:55:53,626 --> 00:55:57,250
Well, if I had
three weeks left live.

888
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:58,907
Hypothetically.

889
00:55:58,941 --> 00:55:59,839
Hypothetically.

890
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,359
Hmm.

891
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:05,500
Well, I think I would want
to spend it with my family.

892
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:07,294
Hmm.

893
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:08,882
I would agree.

894
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:11,160
We believe that family is
just as important in life

895
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:12,161
as it is in death.

896
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,066
Behold, children are a
heritage from the Lord,

897
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,585
the fruit of the womb.

898
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:22,689
Fruit of the loom?

899
00:56:22,724 --> 00:56:23,863
Womb.

900
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:25,589
[Daniel] Oh, sorry.

901
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:28,868
There's nothing more
wonderful and fulfilling

902
00:56:28,902 --> 00:56:30,283
then the presence of family.

903
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:33,838
Children are a
heritage from the Lord,

904
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:36,565
offspring, a reward from him.

905
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:40,327
Now, speaking of offspring,

906
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:42,157
look who's come home,

907
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:43,330
my son Dylan.

908
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:46,437
Hello?

909
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:47,300
Hi.

910
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,169
Mormons?

911
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:57,517
We prefer church of Jesus
Christ of Modern Day Saints.

912
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,761
Hey Dylan, why don't you
go upstairs to your room

913
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:03,040
and play one of your video
games, like space invaders.

914
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:04,248
Space invaders?

915
00:57:04,282 --> 00:57:06,215
Or any video game?

916
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,976
I wasn't even born then.

917
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,047
I'm entertaining
guests right now.

918
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:13,015
You're entertaining Mormons.

919
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:16,743
- How?
- Dylan!

920
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:19,297
[soft music]

921
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,513
Mormons!

922
00:57:27,547 --> 00:57:28,375
How cool.

923
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,999
And my daughter, Chloe.

924
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,484
Oh.

925
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,142
[ethereal music]

926
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:41,250
I'm Chloe.

927
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:42,562
I just said that.

928
00:57:42,597 --> 00:57:44,737
I'm elder Jones.

929
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:46,221

I hope you don't mind
that I brought her in.

1110
01:08:57,271 --> 01:08:58,168
Oh, sure.

1111
01:08:58,203 --> 01:08:59,997
No, that, that that's fine.

1112
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:01,240
Hi there, what's your name?

1113
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:02,517
Olivia.

1114
01:09:02,552 --> 01:09:03,449
[Daniel] Olivia.

1115
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:04,933
That's a very pretty name.

1116
01:09:04,968 --> 01:09:05,796
Thank you.

1117
01:09:06,728 --> 01:09:07,867
I hope everything is okay.

1118
01:09:07,902 --> 01:09:09,490
Oh, oh, it is.

1119
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:10,905
I just thought it
would be important

1120
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:13,252
to tell you face to face.

1121
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:15,047
I was looking over
that umbrella policy,

1122
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:17,153
the one you just took out,

1123
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:20,708
and I'm thinking maybe it's
not necessary after all.

1124
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:23,297
Oh really?

1125
01:09:25,575 --> 01:09:27,163
Well, I trust your judgment

1126
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,027
and you know what's best.

1127
01:09:30,062 --> 01:09:31,650
Well, thanks.

1128
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:34,273
[gentle music]

1129
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,828
There you go.

1130
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:41,384
Is, is this the way out?

1131
01:09:41,418 --> 01:09:42,626
Yes.

1132
01:09:42,661 --> 01:09:44,525
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a great day.

1133
01:09:49,254 --> 01:09:50,082
Daniel?

1134
01:09:51,256 --> 01:09:53,016
- Yeah.
- What's up?

1135
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,844
I don't know.

1136
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:55,087
He's been acting strange

1137
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:56,985
ever since he went to
see that. Dr. Hajia.

1138
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,401
Oh, he went to go see him.

1139
01:09:58,435 --> 01:10:00,541
Yeah. Got to tell you,
I talked him into it.

1140
01:10:02,128 --> 01:10:03,958
Strange how?

1141
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,856
Like he's got
something on his mind.

1142
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,482
Didn't you say he
was talking to Mormons?

1143
01:10:10,516 --> 01:10:12,173
You think that's it?

1144
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,381
What?

1145
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:14,762
Like they brainwashed
him or something.

1146
01:10:14,796 --> 01:10:15,763
It's just one time.

1147
01:10:17,074 --> 01:10:19,629
Was it something
Dr. Hajia told him?

1148
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:21,147
Maybe.

1149
01:10:21,182 --> 01:10:22,666
He said they were gonna run
some routine blood tests

1150
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:24,910
and he's been waiting
to hear the results.

1151
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:26,946
It's taking them forever.

1152
01:10:26,981 --> 01:10:28,189
That's it.

1153
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,502
Blood tests always
make me nervous.

1154
01:10:30,536 --> 01:10:32,124
Yeah, probably.

1155
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,334
Otherwise he's doing
everything he normally does.

1156
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:36,197
Hmm.

1157
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:43,791
Come here, baby.

1158
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:48,899
[lively music]

1159
01:10:48,934 --> 01:10:52,731
[Ms. Tucker speaking off mic]

1160
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,977
Did everything come
out okay, baby?

1161
01:10:58,012 --> 01:10:59,393
Sure did.

1162
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:00,221
There it is.

1163
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:03,431
Thank you so much
for walking Pretzel.

1164
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:05,191
I really do appreciate it.

1165
01:11:05,226 --> 01:11:06,779
- Sure.
- Would you like to come in

1166
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:08,643
for some refreshments?

1167
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:11,577
Thank you, no.

1168
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:12,716
I gotta get back.

1169
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:14,822
Am I losing my mind

1170
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:16,686
or did I just see
you hand a baggy

1171
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,619
of dog poop to Ms. Tucker?

1172
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,660
Honey, is there
anything I should know?

1173
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,213
No.

1174
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:30,838
Let's just say that for
now, I've had an epiphany.

1175
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:32,598
Epiphany?

1176
01:11:33,634 --> 01:11:35,187
Can you even spell that word?

1177
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:37,534
Probably not, but
I know what it means.

1178
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:38,604
And that's all that's important.

1179
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:41,158
And what was your epiphany?

1180
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:44,438
Truth is there are
no backstage passes.

1181
01:11:44,472 --> 01:11:45,646
Backstage passes?

1182
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,474
To heaven.

1183
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:48,442
Nevermind.

1184
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,548
If, if we're to
be good with God,

1185
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,447
we got to show we're serious.

1186
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:57,071
I mean God helps those who
help themselves, right?

1187
01:11:58,279 --> 01:11:59,625
For however long we're here.

1188
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:05,493
You can't earn
salvation, Daniel.

1189
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:06,667
I know that.

1190
01:12:06,701 --> 01:12:08,013
It doesn't sound like it.

1191
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:13,812
So this is why you've
been talking to Mormons

1192
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:15,538
and walking Ms. Tucker's dog?

1193
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:16,780
No.

1194
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:19,404
And yes.

1195
01:12:19,438 --> 01:12:21,854
[soft music]

1196
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:42,806
Pick up the book,

1197
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:44,981
read it and decide for yourself.

1198
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:45,844
Rebecca.

1199
01:12:48,122 --> 01:12:49,261
Oh boy.

1200
01:12:49,295 --> 01:12:50,504
[Daniel] What?

1201
01:12:50,538 --> 01:12:52,229
You've only called
me Rebecca three times

1202
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:53,748
since I've known you.

1203
01:12:53,783 --> 01:12:54,956
The night we first met,

1204
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:56,268
I told you my name

1205
01:12:56,302 --> 01:12:58,028
and you repeated it
just before we kissed

1206
01:12:58,063 --> 01:12:59,582
for the first time.

1207
01:12:59,616 --> 01:13:01,066
The time you accidentally
dropped the new car keys

1208
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,550
in the sewer,

1209
01:13:02,585 --> 01:13:04,172
outside the hotel we were
staying at in Florida.

1210
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:06,105
And the first and only time

1211
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,763
you've ever asked if your
mother could live with us.

1212
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:09,937
Really?

1213
01:13:09,971 --> 01:13:11,179
Only three.

1214
01:13:11,214 --> 01:13:13,250
So get to what
you're gonna say.

1215
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:15,425
The last time I
tried to tell someone

1216
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,357
it didn't go so well.

1217
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,841
Your mother.

1218
01:13:17,876 --> 01:13:18,739
How'd you know?

1219
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:21,880
Mom.

1220
01:13:21,914 --> 01:13:23,364
Not now, honey,

1221
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,642
your dad may be in the
middle of another epiphany.

1222
01:13:25,677 --> 01:13:27,057
Ah, what?

1223
01:13:27,092 --> 01:13:29,025
The reason I've been
acting a little strange

1224
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:30,267
the last few days.

1225
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:32,062
You're going to
become a Mormon.

1226
01:13:33,236 --> 01:13:34,858
No.

1227
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:37,205
In the Chicago suburb
of Bethany, Illinois,

1228
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,449
an Indonesian man
posing as a doctor

1229
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:42,763
was arrested two days ago
and is now in custody.

1230
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:44,247
Dr. Morak Hajia,

1231
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:46,594
also known as the
doctor of the stars,

1232
01:13:46,629 --> 01:13:49,321
has developed a somewhat
notable reputation

1233
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:51,185
for treating various celebrities

1234
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,083
throughout the
entertainment industry.

1235
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:55,258
Dr. Hajia has been
under investigation

1236
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,225
since the closing of
his place of practice

1237
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,124
in Los Angeles last month

1238
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:01,540
for allegedly
posing as a doctor,

1239
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:02,817
seeing patients,

1240
01:14:02,852 --> 01:14:05,233
diagnosing them
with terminal cancer

1241
01:14:05,268 --> 01:14:08,029
and then charging them for
tests that were never performed.

1242
01:14:08,064 --> 01:14:09,306
It appears the fake doctor

1243
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:10,929
thought the little
town of Bethany

1244
01:14:10,963 --> 01:14:12,793
would be the perfect
place to hide

1245
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:15,174
and continue his
illegal practice.

1246
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:17,453
He's being charged with
the unlicensed practice

1247
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:19,213
of a healthcare profession.

1248
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,802
In other news, four men
were charged last week

1249
01:14:21,836 --> 01:14:23,217
with car jacking
a woman in the...

1250
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,252
Yes!

1251
01:14:24,287 --> 01:14:26,116
[laughs]

1252
01:14:26,151 --> 01:14:26,979
Rebecca!

1253
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:37,473
[tango music]

1254
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:43,996
Mormons.

1255
01:14:44,031 --> 01:14:46,412
[tango music]

1256
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,487
[soft music]

1257
01:14:54,144 --> 01:14:55,525
- Daniel.
- Yes?

1258
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,561
Don't drop me.

1259
01:14:56,595 --> 01:14:58,045
Oh.

1260
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:00,496
[soft music]

1261
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:11,127
I am so sorry, Daniel.

1262
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:14,751
For what?

1263
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,824
I was the one who
recommended you go to him.

1264
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,482
If it wasn't for me,

1265
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,311
you never had to go
through all of that.

1266
01:15:23,346 --> 01:15:24,589
Hey.

1267
01:15:24,623 --> 01:15:25,624
It's not your fault.

1268
01:15:27,246 --> 01:15:28,075
Yes it is.

1269
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:30,664
Okay, it is.

1270
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:35,151
So you got yourself all
worked up for nothing.

1271
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:39,189
What must have been
going through your mind?

1272
01:15:39,224 --> 01:15:40,881
Well, I was losing my mind.

1273
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:52,686
That night, I told you I
was gonna pray and I did.

1274
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,274
I was so sure I
was gonna die, I,

1275
01:15:55,309 --> 01:15:56,690
I even asked God to heal me.

1276
01:15:57,725 --> 01:15:58,554
You did?

1277
01:16:02,765 --> 01:16:06,734
It was the most sincere
prayer that I've ever prayed

1278
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:07,563
from the heart.

1279
01:16:10,462 --> 01:16:12,671
The most honest that
I've ever been with him.

1280
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:15,571
That's wonderful.

1281
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,101
I even went as far
as to promise him

1282
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:31,034
a bunch of things I
do if he healed me.

1283
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:36,246
Oh, I'm glad that's over.

1284
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:39,560
I don't know how long I
could have kept that up.

1285
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:44,013
Kept what up?

1286
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:45,014
The promises.

1287
01:16:46,325 --> 01:16:47,672
The ones you made to God?

1288
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:49,466
[Daniel] Yeah.

1289
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:54,023
You told me it
was the most honest

1290
01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:56,094
you've ever been with him.

1291
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:57,026
[Daniel] It was.

1292
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:01,962
So you're not gonna keep
the promises you made?

1293
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:02,928
What?

1294
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:06,173
No, I, I, yes, of course.

1295
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:20,083
Other than your blood
pressure being a little high,

1296
01:17:20,118 --> 01:17:22,983
I'd have to say
you're, you're fine.

1297
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:24,881
Everything's good.

1298
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:27,090
Well, what about
the chest pains?

1299
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,816
Well, that was
probably anxiety.

1300
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:31,750
The x-rays didn't
show anything and

1301
01:17:33,027 --> 01:17:34,650
the stress test
came back normal.

1302
01:17:36,134 --> 01:17:37,998
But you know what?

1303
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:39,171
I think I'm gonna
have to put you

1304
01:17:39,206 --> 01:17:40,759
on some blood pressure meds.

1305
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:44,590
Is that really necessary?

1306
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,869
You want to die?

1307
01:17:46,903 --> 01:17:47,835
No.

1308
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:51,597

01:18:08,442 --> 01:18:10,686
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1312
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,692
You got a call
from Mr. Hargrove.

1313
01:18:16,726 --> 01:18:18,245
He wants you to call him.

1314
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:19,453
Anything else?

1315
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:20,903
Oh, the main
office sent an email

1316
01:18:20,937 --> 01:18:23,215
to confirm the changes
in Mrs. Loomis' coverage.

1317
01:18:24,665 --> 01:18:25,493
Right.

1318
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:30,947
Wait,

1319
01:18:30,982 --> 01:18:31,776
you know what?

1320
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,638
Don't respond.

1321
01:18:34,295 --> 01:18:36,263
I need to look over
that coverage again.

1322
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:38,783
Okay.

1324
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:53,176
Here you go.

Hey, dad, can
[mumbles] at table 12?

1326
01:19:06,811 --> 01:19:07,639
Sure.

1327

Benji.

1328
01:19:15,302 --> 01:19:16,544
I got another complaint
about a delivery you did.

1329
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:18,719
I'm sorry, Antonio.

1330
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,859
I'll be more
careful when I ride.

1331
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:24,242
This bike thing
isn't working out.

1332
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:26,589
I can't keep losing
more customers.

1333
01:19:26,623 --> 01:19:28,764
I thought you said you
had a driver's license.

1334
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:32,664
It expired the long time ago.

1335
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,289
Look, Benji, you've
been here only a month and

1336
01:19:37,324 --> 01:19:38,670
it just isn't working out.

1337
01:19:41,293 --> 01:19:43,261
Then no raise.

1338
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:45,573
No, I told you that
the last time you asked.

1339
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,818
The no job?

1340
01:19:48,853 --> 01:19:49,681
No job.

1341
01:19:51,407 --> 01:19:52,235
Sorry.

1342
01:19:58,621 --> 01:20:00,830
Mom, what are you doing here?

1343
01:20:00,865 --> 01:20:02,280
Anita.

1344
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:04,351
Anita, what are
you doing here?

1345
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:06,594
Well, I'm standing
out here on your porch

1346
01:20:06,629 --> 01:20:08,700
waiting for you to
invite me in the house.

1347
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:10,598
Oh, sorry.

1348
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:11,461
Come on in.

1349
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:15,120
I've been experimenting again.

Bourbon and Coke?

1355
01:20:37,798 --> 01:20:39,627
We don't have any hard liquor.

1356
01:20:39,662 --> 01:20:41,250
How about a bottle of water?

1357
01:20:41,284 --> 01:20:42,078
Eh.

1358
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:44,529
Water makes me sick.

[soft music]

1360
01:20:48,257 --> 01:20:49,810
Is my son around?

1361
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,916
He's at work.

1362
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:56,955
I hear he came to visit
you a couple of weeks ago.

1363
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:02,409
Yes and what he told
me was quite a shock.

1364
01:21:02,443 --> 01:21:04,100
Oh yes, it was.

1365
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:07,310
So he told you?

1366
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:08,173
Yes, he did.

1367
01:21:09,726 --> 01:21:11,245
Took him a while to
work up the courage,

1368
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,902
but he finally did.

1369
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:15,905
Well, I told him to.

1370
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,494
You're taking it quite well.

1371
01:21:18,528 --> 01:21:20,461
Well, it was quite
a shock at first,

1372
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:22,187
but once he stopped
seeing that guy

1373
01:21:22,222 --> 01:21:24,672
and went back to the other
he's much better now.

1374
01:21:29,643 --> 01:21:30,713
There was another?

1375
01:21:31,748 --> 01:21:33,233
Of course.

1376
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:36,098
He had been seeing him for
at least the last 12 years.

1377
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:37,927
And didn't really like
his bedside manner.

1378
01:21:37,962 --> 01:21:40,757
So I suggested he
sees someone else.

1379
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:45,866
You,

1380
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,317
you suggested.

1381
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:50,698
Well he was so unhappy
with the other guy,

1382
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:53,218
I thought it would doing
good to see someone else.

1383
01:21:57,188 --> 01:21:57,982
Something wrong?

1384
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:03,401
Honey, not if
it's okay with you.

1385
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:05,955
Of course it is.

for something better.

I think we're done.

That's the reason I came

1393

to make sure everything
was okay with all that.

good to be true.

it was come covered.

Of course I did.

That's why I took out

cover everything.

[Waitress] Is everything okay?

1470
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:12,546
Yeah, we're good.

1471
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:17,827
All I know is you
said it was covered.

1472
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:19,691
How is that misleading, huh?

1473
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:21,935
Well, you know, this could
be looked at another way.

1474
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,454
How?

1475
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,214
The reason you took out
the additional coverage

1476
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:27,423
with everything that's happened,

1477
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:29,632
it might look
suspicious on your part.

1478
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:30,495
That so?

1479
01:26:31,703 --> 01:26:33,705
Well wouldn't a good
agent have known that

1480
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,500
and not approved it?

1481
01:26:35,535 --> 01:26:37,019
You know, this doesn't
look any better for you

1482
01:26:37,053 --> 01:26:38,227
than it does me, Daniel.

1483
01:26:39,124 --> 01:26:40,298
Maybe we'll just let

1484
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,714
the Illinois Department
of Insurance decide.

1485
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:45,061
Use your good intentions
to pick up the check.

1486
01:26:47,305 --> 01:26:49,031
Lee, come on.

1487
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,068
Great.

1488
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,110
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

1489
01:26:59,144 --> 01:27:01,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

1490
01:27:01,285 --> 01:27:04,011
Guys, what are you doing here?

1491
01:27:04,046 --> 01:27:06,635
You said anytime we
were in the neighborhood

1492
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:08,430
and we were in the neighborhood.

1493
01:27:09,879 --> 01:27:12,019
Yeah, well that was
obviously a failed attempt

1494
01:27:12,054 --> 01:27:13,952
at a subliminal goodbye.

1495
01:27:13,987 --> 01:27:14,850
Can we come in?

1496
01:27:14,884 --> 01:27:16,334
Gee, you know, I,

1497
01:27:16,369 --> 01:27:19,234
I just got in from work
and there's a lot going on.

1498
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:20,096
We understand.

1499
01:27:21,615 --> 01:27:22,858
Elder Wallace.

1500
01:27:23,893 --> 01:27:25,205
I don't see the a dog.

1501
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,139
Maybe if we hurry,
we can make it.

1502
01:27:31,107 --> 01:27:33,765
Elders, guys wait.

1503
01:27:35,802 --> 01:27:36,734
All right.

1504
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:39,357
Just for a little while.

1505
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:41,773
[soft music]

1506
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:47,745
And how are you Daniel?

1507
01:27:48,642 --> 01:27:50,334
Good, good.

1508
01:27:50,368 --> 01:27:51,196
With God?

1509
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:53,785
Oh yeah.

1510
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,166
Good with God.

1511
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,754
Yeah, everything's great.

1512
01:27:56,788 --> 01:27:58,238
Great with God.

1513
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,688
Couldn't be better.

1514
01:27:59,722 --> 01:28:01,345
That's wonderful.

1515
01:28:01,379 --> 01:28:03,933
Did you get a chance to read
the pamphlets we left you?

1516
01:28:03,968 --> 01:28:05,349
Pamphlets?

1517
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:07,385
Yes I did.

1518
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,455
What did you think?

1519
01:28:09,353 --> 01:28:11,286
Everything looked good.

1520
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,150
You know, made sense within
the context of your religion.

1521
01:28:16,843 --> 01:28:18,569
But you know what,

1522
01:28:18,603 --> 01:28:21,157
there was one thing I
had a big issue with.

1523
01:28:21,192 --> 01:28:22,435
What's that?

1524
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:24,747
Well, the whole
coming back thing.

1525
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:26,024
The resurrection.

1526
01:28:26,059 --> 01:28:27,060
Yeah.

1527
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:28,613
So in your religion,

1528
01:28:28,648 --> 01:28:30,891
you believe that everyone
comes back from the dead?

1529
01:28:30,926 --> 01:28:31,720
Yes.

1530
01:28:31,754 --> 01:28:32,652
Everyone?

1531
01:28:32,686 --> 01:28:34,136
Everyone.

1532
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:35,827
Isn't that reincarnation?

1533
01:28:35,862 --> 01:28:37,070
No, with reincarnation,

1534
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:39,728
you would come back
as something else.

1535
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:42,040
Like a cat or a bird.

1536
01:28:42,075 --> 01:28:43,456
And with the resurrection,

1537
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:46,838
you come back as you.

1538
01:28:46,873 --> 01:28:48,495
In the same body?

1539
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,083
Yeah.

1540
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:51,602
Huh?

1541
01:28:51,636 --> 01:28:52,948
I don't know if he was a Mormon,

1542
01:28:52,982 --> 01:28:55,330
but that might explain
Keith Richards.

1543
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:57,746
I mean, he looks like he
may have died and come back

1544
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,057
a couple of times.

1545
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:01,266
Who?

1546
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:02,095
From the Rolling Stones.

1547
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,235
- Oh.
- Oh, I see.

1548
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:08,550
Well and, and what
if you're cremated?

1549
01:29:08,584 --> 01:29:11,587
I mean, do you come
back as baby powder?

1550
01:29:14,935 --> 01:29:16,247
Ah, you see,

1551
01:29:16,281 --> 01:29:17,973
that's why I'm
having the problem.

1552
01:29:19,457 --> 01:29:21,494
You know, honestly,
I lost all interest

1553
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:22,736
in people coming back to life

1554
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:24,980
after the seventh season
of "The Walking Dead".

1555
01:29:25,014 --> 01:29:26,533
Oh, but that's...

1556
01:29:26,568 --> 01:29:31,124
Look guys, I totally respect
your faith and your religion,

1557
01:29:32,021 --> 01:29:33,022
but I'm afraid it's not for me.

1558
01:29:33,057 --> 01:29:33,989
But Daniel.

1559
01:29:34,023 --> 01:29:35,266
What?

1560
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,475
I thought you said
you were a Christian.

1561
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:38,925
I am.

1562
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:42,135
Then you understand
about the resurrection.

1563
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,759
I do.

1564
01:29:45,794 --> 01:29:46,622
You should.

1565
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:49,901
All right, guys,

1566
01:29:49,936 --> 01:29:52,939
really appreciate you stopping
by and talking with me,

1567
01:29:52,973 --> 01:29:56,252
but I was messed up.

1568
01:29:56,287 --> 01:29:58,358
Okay, truth is
this doctor told me

1569
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,360
I may have had only
a few weeks to live.

1570
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,326
Hypothetically.

1571
01:30:03,328 --> 01:30:05,123
Right, hypothetically.

1572
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:09,058
Well, as it turns out, I'm
not gonna die after all.

1573
01:30:10,128 --> 01:30:10,922
Well, that's great.

1574
01:30:10,957 --> 01:30:12,372
Praise God.

1575
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,615
Well, that's just it.

1576
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,238
I mean, actually God had
nothing to do with it.

1577
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,447
I mean, the doctor was a fake

1578
01:30:18,482 --> 01:30:20,794
and I didn't need him
to heal me after all.

1579
01:30:23,763 --> 01:30:25,868
So like I said,
I'm not gonna die.

1580
01:30:27,801 --> 01:30:30,355
But Daniel.

1581
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,736
Yeah?

1582
01:30:31,771 --> 01:30:32,599
You will.

1583
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:35,464
Nice talking to you, Daniel.

1584
01:30:37,086 --> 01:30:37,915
Elder Jones.

1585
01:30:40,504 --> 01:30:41,505
Here.

1586
01:30:41,539 --> 01:30:42,506
Oh, no need.

1587
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:43,334
We,

1588
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:46,026
we know where the door is.

1589
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:48,443
[soft music]

1590
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:09,084
Daniel, hey,

1591
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:10,844
what's going on, man?

1592
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:12,812
I don't have time now, Benji.

1593
01:31:12,846 --> 01:31:15,366
I've got a really
serious problem that needs my attention...

1594
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,229
Yeah, me too.

1595
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:18,576
Not like this you don't.

1596
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,581
Look, I've been trying to
get ahold of you for days now.

1597
01:31:23,616 --> 01:31:27,343
Look, man, I'm in
big trouble, okay.

1598
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:29,518
Something's happened and
I could lose my license.

1599
01:31:29,553 --> 01:31:30,346
Yeah.

1600
01:31:30,381 --> 01:31:31,278
Really bad.

1601
01:31:31,313 --> 01:31:32,452
Well, okay, the same with me.

1602
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,902
I mean, how about,

1603
01:31:33,936 --> 01:31:36,594
look, you said that I
could come to you and I am.

1604
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:37,422
Benji.

1605
01:31:37,457 --> 01:31:38,941
Benji.

1606
01:31:38,976 --> 01:31:42,462
You're just gonna have to deal
with whatever it is, okay.

1607
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,534
You're a full grown man
for crying out loud.

1608
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:47,122
Hey, crying out loud.

1609
01:31:47,156 --> 01:31:50,850
Look what happened
is I went, what?

1610
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:52,127
You walking?

1611
01:31:57,235 --> 01:31:58,029
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1612
01:31:58,064 --> 01:31:59,237
I'll calm down.

1613
01:31:59,272 --> 01:32:00,860
Look Benjamin.

1614
01:32:02,102 --> 01:32:04,035
I've known you ever
since seventh grade.

1615
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:07,763
I know just about everything
that's ever happened to you.

1616
01:32:07,798 --> 01:32:10,179
But not what just happened.

1617
01:32:10,214 --> 01:32:11,836
The world does not revolve

1618
01:32:11,871 --> 01:32:14,183
around everything that
happens to you, man.

1619
01:32:14,218 --> 01:32:15,426
I didn't say,

1620
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,669
cause you said I
could come to you.

1621
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:18,602
- I have my own life...
- Then why'd come to me.

1622
01:32:18,636 --> 01:32:23,607
And right now I have
a very serious problem.

1623
01:32:24,193 --> 01:32:25,022
What?

1624
01:32:26,437 --> 01:32:28,577
Did you find out that
you're gonna die after all?

1625
01:32:28,612 --> 01:32:29,923
No.

1626
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:33,444
I told you I'm not going to die.

1627
01:32:33,478 --> 01:32:34,272
Why should I.

1628
01:32:34,307 --> 01:32:35,204
Hey, something...

1629
01:32:35,239 --> 01:32:36,723
You told me a lot of things...

1630
01:32:36,758 --> 01:32:40,347
Somethings happening that
could jeopardize my reputation

1631
01:32:40,382 --> 01:32:43,419
and could result in
me losing my business.

1632
01:32:43,454 --> 01:32:44,317
But no matter what happens...

1633
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:45,421
- I don't...
- Hey,

1634
01:32:45,456 --> 01:32:47,009
I'll get over it.

1635
01:32:47,044 --> 01:32:48,079
I'll get over it.

1636
01:32:48,114 --> 01:32:49,805
That's what you need to do.

1637
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,289
But Danny, I...

1638
01:32:51,324 --> 01:32:53,533
Beverly's dead.

1639
01:32:55,431 --> 01:32:57,433
Get over it, man.

1640
01:32:57,468 --> 01:32:59,919
[tense music]

1641
01:33:01,783 --> 01:33:03,025
Let it go.

1642
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,580
[tense music]

1643
01:33:28,188 --> 01:33:29,017
Benji.

1644
01:33:31,536 --> 01:33:33,815
One of my customers,
Lee Hargrove,

1645
01:33:33,849 --> 01:33:34,988
just filed a complaint

1646
01:33:35,023 --> 01:33:37,025
with the Illinois
Department of Insurance.

1647
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,063
Yeah, he claims that I
intentionally sold coverage

1648
01:33:41,098 --> 01:33:43,238
above and beyond the
market value of the car

1649
01:33:43,272 --> 01:33:45,171
and verbally promised
and we cover it.

1650
01:33:45,205 --> 01:33:46,793
- Did you?
- Yes.

1651
01:33:48,484 --> 01:33:50,003
But he told me he had someone

1652
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:52,903
he thought would buy it for 40
grand if he did the upgrades.

1653
01:33:54,283 --> 01:33:55,837
So I thought, what are the odds

1654
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:58,287
something would happen to
the car in the interim.

1655
01:33:58,322 --> 01:33:59,875
And?

1656
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:02,878
It burned down to the ground
last week and was totaled.

1657
01:34:04,535 --> 01:34:06,019
And I think he
might have done it.

1658
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:08,504
[soft music]

1659
01:34:17,893 --> 01:34:19,584
Wasn't he one of
your best clients?

1660
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:20,862
Yes, Becca.

1661
01:34:20,896 --> 01:34:22,829
- That's why I did it.
- Don't yell at me!

1662
01:34:26,937 --> 01:34:30,285
It happened right after
the whole Dr. Hajia thing.

1663
01:34:31,976 --> 01:34:33,253
You wouldn't believe what
was going through my mind

1664
01:34:33,288 --> 01:34:35,083
at the time.

1665
01:34:35,117 --> 01:34:36,325
And that's why I
was double checking

1666
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:39,225
my life insurance policy
and giving away money,

1667
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:41,710
talking with Mormons.

1668
01:34:42,642 --> 01:34:43,919
Now look, what's happened.

1669
01:34:45,334 --> 01:34:48,061
What does this have anything
to do with all of that?

1670
01:34:48,096 --> 01:34:50,512
He was my best customer.

1671
01:34:50,546 --> 01:34:54,102
I thought I was doing something
good for him personally.

1672
01:34:55,172 --> 01:34:56,794
Then you took it out on Benji.

1673
01:34:56,829 --> 01:34:57,864
What about Benji?

1674
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,559
Your father told Benji
to get over Beverly.

1675
01:35:03,594 --> 01:35:04,422
His bike?

1676
01:35:07,805 --> 01:35:08,599
No.

1677
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,912
Beverly was a real person.

1678
01:35:13,017 --> 01:35:13,915
So?

1679
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,504
Benji was engaged woman

1680
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:19,714
named Beverly Arnold
many years ago.

1681
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:22,578
They were out test driving
a new car they had bought

1682
01:35:22,613 --> 01:35:24,201
when the car missed
a sharp curve

1683
01:35:24,235 --> 01:35:25,892
at 60 miles an hour

1684
01:35:25,927 --> 01:35:27,273
and ended in the ditch.

1685
01:35:28,619 --> 01:35:30,103
She wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

1686
01:35:31,415 --> 01:35:32,243
She died.

1687
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:37,007
He passed out at the wheel
from low blood sugar.

1688
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:39,216
At the time, he didn't
know he was diabetic.

1689
01:35:41,114 --> 01:35:43,461
[Chloe] That's why
he doesn't drive?

1690
01:35:43,496 --> 01:35:45,084
Yes.

1691
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:47,086
In addition to that, he's
got problems with his heart.

1692
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,915
That's why he is
on all those meds.

1693
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:50,192
He's never been the same.

1694
01:35:52,332 --> 01:35:55,197
That doesn't sound like
something that easy to get over.

1695
01:35:58,511 --> 01:35:59,339
No Chloe,

1696
01:36:02,101 --> 01:36:03,102
it doesn't.

1697
01:36:04,689 --> 01:36:07,002
[sad music]

1698
01:36:33,304 --> 01:36:34,581
Maybe Danny's right

1699
01:36:35,548 --> 01:36:37,861
[sad music]

1700
01:36:45,075 --> 01:36:46,904
Time to let go.

1701
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:49,251
[sad music]

1702
01:37:23,803 --> 01:37:25,149
Can I ask you something?

1703
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:27,358
What did you promise?

1704
01:37:28,221 --> 01:37:29,464
To who?

1705
01:37:29,498 --> 01:37:30,430
God.

1706
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:31,915
What did you promise, Daniel?

1707
01:37:33,744 --> 01:37:35,263
Lots of things,

1708
01:37:35,297 --> 01:37:37,472
like walking Cujo.

1709
01:37:37,506 --> 01:37:39,060
What else?

1710
01:37:39,094 --> 01:37:40,751
It doesn't matter.

1711
01:37:40,785 --> 01:37:42,339
I'm okay.

1712
01:37:42,373 --> 01:37:43,443
It was a false alarm.

1713
01:37:44,444 --> 01:37:45,376
He knows that.

1714
01:37:47,309 --> 01:37:48,932
But as stupid as this sounds,

1715
01:37:48,966 --> 01:37:51,313
I just thought the
promises I made

1716
01:37:51,348 --> 01:37:53,453
were contingent
upon him healing me.

1717
01:37:56,318 --> 01:37:58,079
I said it was stupid.

1718
01:37:58,113 --> 01:38:00,495
[soft music]

1719
01:38:07,364 --> 01:38:09,987
If a man vows
a vow to the Lord

1720
01:38:10,022 --> 01:38:13,094
or swears an oath to
bind himself by a pledge,

1721
01:38:13,128 --> 01:38:15,751
he shall not break his word.

1722
01:38:17,512 --> 01:38:20,653
God doesn't make deals.

1723
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:24,036
He isn't someone that you
can bribe into healing you,

1724
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:26,831
especially with vain promises
of being a good person.

1725
01:38:26,866 --> 01:38:28,005
You know that Daniel.

1726
01:38:30,214 --> 01:38:33,390
Rather than being concerned
with keeping promises,

1727
01:38:33,424 --> 01:38:35,047
maybe you should
be more concerned

1728
01:38:35,081 --> 01:38:37,842
with what God really
requires of you now.

1729
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:41,743
Admit your weaknesses to him

1730
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,403
and pray for God to
renew your heart.

1731
01:38:47,645 --> 01:38:49,371
Now that's easy
for you to say.

1732
01:38:49,406 --> 01:38:52,098
You've always been better at
this sort of stuff than me.

1733
01:38:59,485 --> 01:39:01,383
Then get better at it.

1734
01:39:01,418 --> 01:39:03,938
[tense music]

1735
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:15,466
[soft music]

1736
01:39:45,048 --> 01:39:46,221
[Girl] He passed away.

1737
01:39:53,815 --> 01:39:54,609
Excuse me.

1738
01:39:56,335 --> 01:39:57,543
The old man.

1739
01:39:57,577 --> 01:39:59,717
That's why you looked
over here, right?

1740
01:40:01,961 --> 01:40:03,825
How did you know
about the old man?

1741
01:40:08,036 --> 01:40:09,934
Probably shouldn't be
talking to strangers.

1742
01:40:09,969 --> 01:40:12,489
I shouldn't really be
talking to anyone, but you.

1743
01:40:13,524 --> 01:40:14,387
Me?

1744
01:40:14,422 --> 01:40:15,250
Or anyone.

1745
01:40:21,774 --> 01:40:24,259
Well you don't have anything
to worry about with me.

1746
01:40:25,226 --> 01:40:26,192
Is that a promise?

1747
01:40:30,196 --> 01:40:31,473
Yes, that's a promise.

1748
01:40:36,616 --> 01:40:38,687
Someone watching over you?

1749
01:40:38,722 --> 01:40:39,550
Always.

1750
01:40:41,449 --> 01:40:42,760
The last time I was here,

1751
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,280
I thought I was gonna die.

1752
01:40:48,628 --> 01:40:50,113
The park looked different then.

1753
01:40:53,288 --> 01:40:54,082
I,

1754
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:58,259
I saw things that I
had taken for granted

1755
01:40:59,191 --> 01:41:00,226
as it for the first time.

1756
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:01,262
And now?

1757
01:41:01,296 --> 01:41:02,090
Now?

1758
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,510
Now it all looks
like it did before.

1759
01:41:09,615 --> 01:41:10,823
Why?

1760
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:12,411
Probably because
I'm like I was before

1761
01:41:12,445 --> 01:41:13,791
I thought it might be over.

1762
01:41:14,965 --> 01:41:15,862
Were you scared?

1763
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:18,244
Yep.

1764
01:41:21,834 --> 01:41:24,147
And I did a lot of stupid
things because of it,

1765
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,220
some things that
became mistakes,

1766
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:30,429
big ones.

1767
01:41:30,463 --> 01:41:31,326
You sure did.

1768
01:41:35,813 --> 01:41:37,298
I even asked God to heal me,

1769
01:41:41,302 --> 01:41:42,751
but as it turned out, I

1770
01:41:43,925 --> 01:41:45,685
went to a different
doctor later and

1771
01:41:46,617 --> 01:41:47,653
found out I was okay.

1772
01:41:49,482 --> 01:41:50,242
And Daniel,

1773
01:41:53,072 --> 01:41:54,901
how do you know he didn't?

1774
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,297
[birds singing]

1775
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:21,031
Wow the strangest thing
just happened in the park.

1776
01:42:21,065 --> 01:42:23,654
[somber music]

1777
01:42:27,417 --> 01:42:28,245
Dad.

1778
01:42:31,697 --> 01:42:35,321
They found Benji on the
floor of his apartment,

1779
01:42:35,356 --> 01:42:36,322
unconscious.

1780
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:38,117
What?

1781
01:42:39,567 --> 01:42:43,640
They found Benji on the
floor of his apartment.

1782
01:42:45,089 --> 01:42:46,815
But who's they?

1783
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:48,472
His landlord,

1784
01:42:48,507 --> 01:42:49,887
the police.

1785
01:42:49,922 --> 01:42:51,751
Well, what happened?

1786
01:42:51,786 --> 01:42:52,683
They don't know.

1787
01:42:53,753 --> 01:42:55,169
They're still looking into it,

1788
01:42:56,204 --> 01:42:57,861
but they think it was his heart

1789
01:42:58,724 --> 01:42:59,932
due to his diabetes.

1790
01:43:01,209 --> 01:43:02,866
What hospital?

1791
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,661
They did everything
they could.

1792
01:43:04,695 --> 01:43:07,042
[sad music]

1793
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:15,223
It's too late.

1794
01:43:16,362 --> 01:43:18,675
[sad music]

1795
01:43:43,734 --> 01:43:45,011
[Pastor] Our Father

1796
01:43:45,046 --> 01:43:46,530
who in heaven,

1797
01:43:46,565 --> 01:43:48,877
hallowed by your name.

1798
01:43:48,912 --> 01:43:50,396
Your kingdom come,

1799
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:52,122
Your will done

1800
01:43:52,156 --> 01:43:54,711
on earth as it is in heaven.

1801
01:43:54,745 --> 01:43:56,230
Give us this day

1802
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:57,817
our daily bread

1803
01:43:57,852 --> 01:44:00,164
and forgive us our debts

1804
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:03,202
as we also have
forgiven our debts.

1805
01:44:04,065 --> 01:44:06,861
And lead us not into temptation,

1806
01:44:06,895 --> 01:44:09,553
but deliver us from evil

1807
01:44:09,588 --> 01:44:11,797
for thine is the kingdom,

1808
01:44:11,831 --> 01:44:14,455
the power and the glory.

1809
01:44:14,489 --> 01:44:15,283
Amen.

1810
01:44:17,285 --> 01:44:20,184
And now Benji's
best friend, Daniel

1811
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:21,669
would like to say something.

1812
01:44:43,484 --> 01:44:44,278
Best friend.

1813
01:44:49,421 --> 01:44:50,525
Death is terrifying.

1814
01:44:51,768 --> 01:44:52,803
Don't think it isn't.

1815
01:44:54,391 --> 01:44:58,153
The comfort of never knowing
when it will happen or how,

1816
01:44:59,569 --> 01:45:01,640
gone and usually that's
when we turn to God for help

1817
01:45:02,675 --> 01:45:03,883
as I did, when I was told

1818
01:45:03,918 --> 01:45:05,678
I may have only
three weeks to live.

1819
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,857
I even made promises out
of fear and desperation,

1820
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:16,758
even though I thought I
was being honest to God, I,

1821
01:45:16,793 --> 01:45:17,794
I wasn't.

1822
01:45:20,935 --> 01:45:23,282
Like the doctor, I
was also an imposter

1823
01:45:24,904 --> 01:45:25,733
pretending

1824
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:29,702
to be a loving,
caring Christian.

1825
01:45:29,737 --> 01:45:31,739
I've known Benji since
the seventh grade.

1826
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:35,225
We grew up together.

1827
01:45:38,435 --> 01:45:40,748
Even back then, people
thought he was strange.

1828
01:45:40,782 --> 01:45:43,337
And even though I may not
have known it at the time,

1829
01:45:44,303 --> 01:45:45,718
I was his best friend.

1830
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,033
And unfortunately it took
me all of these years

1831
01:45:50,067 --> 01:45:52,932
to realize that he was mine.

1832
01:45:58,559 --> 01:46:00,492
Now, one of the promises
I made to God was

1833
01:46:00,526 --> 01:46:02,045
to be a better friend to Benji.

1834
01:46:05,082 --> 01:46:07,361
And now the last
memory I'll have of him

1835
01:46:08,431 --> 01:46:09,846
is him trying to reach out to me

1836
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:11,365
and I wasn't there for him.

1837
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:15,679
I, I don't believe that
this is a consequence

1838
01:46:15,714 --> 01:46:18,406
for not keeping one of
those promises I made.

1839
01:46:22,065 --> 01:46:24,239
But right now it feels like it.

1840
01:46:28,658 --> 01:46:29,590
Goodbye, my friend.

1841
01:46:32,144 --> 01:46:34,284
I can't remember if I ever
told you this all these years,

1842
01:46:34,318 --> 01:46:35,354
but I love you.

1843
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,978
And I know you're with God know.

1844
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:43,569
Rest in peace, Benji.

Benji.

1848
01:49:14,168 --> 01:49:17,481
Well, it took some time,
but by God's grace,

1849
01:49:17,516 --> 01:49:20,554
I made good on the
promises that I made Him,

1850
01:49:20,588 --> 01:49:21,693
all of them.

1851
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,007
And it wasn't until I began
being honest with myself

1852
01:49:26,042 --> 01:49:29,217
that I found out what my
true calling was in life.

1853
01:49:30,771 --> 01:49:32,255
So,

1854
01:49:32,289 --> 01:49:33,843
here I am.

[congregation applauds]

1856

And since this is my first day,

1857
01:49:46,062 --> 01:49:49,203
I wanted all of you to know
how I became your pastor.

1858
01:49:50,618 --> 01:49:54,001
I'd like to close with a
verse from Numbers, 30,

1859
01:49:55,312 --> 01:49:56,141
chapter two,

1860
01:49:59,765 --> 01:50:02,043
If a man vows a vow to the Lord

1861
01:50:02,078 --> 01:50:05,702
or swears an oath to bind
himself by some agreement,

1862
01:50:05,737 --> 01:50:08,118
he shall not break his word.

1863
01:50:08,153 --> 01:50:11,812
He shall do according to all
that proceeds out of his mouth.

1864

[soft music]

1865
01:50:21,407 --> 01:50:24,548
So the next time someone
asks you about your faith

1866
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:26,447
and you tell them
you're a Christian,

1867
01:50:28,829 --> 01:50:29,623
be honest

1868
01:50:30,727 --> 01:50:32,867
to yourself and to God.

Wonderful sermon,
Pastor Daniel.

1871
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:50,057
Well, thank you Rose.

1872
01:50:50,091 --> 01:50:52,542
So mom, what did you think?

1873
01:50:52,576 --> 01:50:53,923
Very nice.

1874
01:50:53,957 --> 01:50:55,959
Very nice.

1875
01:50:55,994 --> 01:50:57,374
You messed up a couple of times,

1876
01:50:57,409 --> 01:50:58,893
but you covered it up well.

1877
01:50:58,928 --> 01:51:00,308
Messed up?

1878
01:51:00,343 --> 01:51:01,516
I didn't mess up.

1879
01:51:01,551 --> 01:51:02,656
When?

1880
01:51:02,690 --> 01:51:03,864
- When you...
- You did real good

1881
01:51:03,898 --> 01:51:05,900
for your first time, honey.

1882
01:51:05,935 --> 01:51:07,350
Well, I hope so.

1883
01:51:07,384 --> 01:51:09,352
I hate to think the
three years it took

1884
01:51:09,386 --> 01:51:11,561
to get ordained or for nothing.

1885
01:51:11,595 --> 01:51:14,391
I just hope the
almighty is good

1886
01:51:14,426 --> 01:51:18,464
with what you're doing
and being the way you are.

Mom.

1888
01:51:19,742 --> 01:51:21,226
You think that
becoming a priest

1889
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:23,193
would've changed everything.

Whatever.

1892
01:51:26,196 --> 01:51:29,096
Mom, we have talked
about this many times.

1893
01:51:31,236 --> 01:51:32,306
Actually,

1894
01:51:34,515 --> 01:51:36,068
it did mom.

1895
01:51:36,103 --> 01:51:36,931
It did?

1896
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:43,973
It changed everything.

1897
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:48,080
Well, it's about time.

1898
01:51:48,115 --> 01:51:49,357
But mom.

1899
01:51:49,392 --> 01:51:51,118
Let it go.

Goodbye everyone.

- Bye

01:52:05,857 --> 01:52:08,204
So pastor Dan,

1908
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:10,896
it's a bold move,

old job to do this.

1910
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:15,487
Well, he really didn't have
much choice in the matter.

Well, sometimes we lose
something in his life...

01:52:20,457 --> 01:52:22,045
Like your license.

1915
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,771
Dylan!

1916
01:52:23,806 --> 01:52:26,222
It just means God
has something better in store for us.

01:52:26,256 --> 01:52:27,706
Whether you wanted it or not.

1918

Dylan!

1919
01:52:28,569 --> 01:52:30,778
No, no he, he's right.

1920
01:52:30,813 --> 01:52:33,643
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

1921
01:52:33,677 --> 01:52:35,162
Look, I, I gotta get going.

1922
01:52:37,164 --> 01:52:39,235
Thanks for coming, Dylan.

01:52:39,269 --> 01:52:40,961

1924
01:52:40,995 --> 01:52:42,479
Okay?

1925
01:52:42,514 --> 01:52:44,758
Time to get this
little girl home.

1926
01:52:44,792 --> 01:52:45,897
Yeah.

1927
01:52:45,931 --> 01:52:47,105
Thanks for coming honey.

1928
01:52:47,139 --> 01:52:48,278
Oh, of course.

1929
01:52:51,937 --> 01:52:53,974
You take good care
of my girls, James.

1930
01:52:54,008 --> 01:52:55,216
I will.

1931
01:52:55,251 --> 01:52:56,562

01:53:03,259 --> 01:53:04,087

out of all the promises
you made to God,

hardest to keep?

[Daniel] So did I ever
think I would become a pastor,

1944
01:53:55,898 --> 01:53:58,210
that it was my calling in life?

1945
01:53:58,245 --> 01:53:59,625
Absolutely not.

1946
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,075
Only God knew that.

1947
01:54:02,905 --> 01:54:04,976
Well, it looks like
Mrs. Loomis was right.

1948
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:10,809
Sometimes it can take
almost a whole lifetime

1949
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:12,880
to find out what it is.

1950
01:54:12,915 --> 01:54:14,157
One thing I do know,

1951
01:54:16,780 --> 01:54:18,092
the next time a doctor tells me

1952
01:54:18,127 --> 01:54:19,714
I only have three weeks to live,

1953
01:54:23,339 --> 01:54:24,754
I'm getting a second opinion.
