1
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:26,810
Poppy!

2
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,812
Come on, let's get going.

3
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,814
Where are you?

4
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,315
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

5
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,317
Poppy, get dressed.

6
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,318
Zeb will be here
any minute.

7
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:38,321
Oh. What's all that for?

8
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,324
The picnic for Nono and Barry--
their engagement.

9
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:43,326
You have known about this
for weeks.

10
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,830
Well, I can't remember
every wingding you...

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,331
you got going around here.

12
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,333
It isn't a wingding.

13
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,335
It's for Nono.

14
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:56,339
You're going to have
lots of fun today, Peter.

15
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,342
You know, my family throws
parties for a living.

16
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:02,345
My stepmother--
your soon-to-be
step-grandmother--

17
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:04,848
well, nobody throws
a party like Beck.

18
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:08,351
(phone rings)

19
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,853
Open Arms-- for all of...

20
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,355
Oh, Zeb, where are you?

21
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:13,356
Sorry. I had an emergency.

22
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,858
I'm going to be a little late.

23
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,359
Want me to meet you at the park?

24
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,360
All right.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,862
I'll wrangle up Poppy.

26
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:19,863
See you there.

27
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:23,867
Oh. Come on.

28
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,869
Help me get this stuff
in the car.

29
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,370
Okay.
Okay.

30
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,371
Oh, boy, this is heavy.

31
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,372
Oh, yeah?

32
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:30,874
Too heavy?

33
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:32,876
Well, uh, I can make it.

34
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:33,877
Oh, good.

35
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,378
I'll get the door.

36
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,884
Ah.
You all right?

37
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:42,886
(glass clinking)

38
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:44,387
Oh, Poppy, careful.

39
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:46,389
There's crystal in there.

40
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,391
Crystal? At a picnic?

41
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,393
Well, what
better occasion

42
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,895
than for my nearest
and dearest?

43
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:55,398
Oh.

44
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:57,901
Well, how can you have a picnic
without food?

45
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,402
Biddy's making the food.

46
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,403
As always.

47
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:01,905
Oh.

48
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:05,325
Mmm-- snails in phyllo dough.

49
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,827
Mom, can't we ever have
hamburgers and hot dogs

50
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,329
like normal people?

51
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,331
Which?

52
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,332
Uh, sneakers.

53
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,834
Beck says she wants to organize
a family baseball game.

54
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,840
Oh, there it is.

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,343
Ow! Oh!

56
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,846
(chuckling)

57
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,348
(horn honks)

58
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,851
Hey. Come on, I'm starving.

59
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,852
All right, all right.

60
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,356
(chuckling)

61
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,358
Is there any food in there?

62
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,361
No. It's for the champagne.

63
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,363
Oh.
I hope Patch

64
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,365
remembered the bats and balls.

65
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,370
So, where is everybody?

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,372
Beck did say everybody
was supposed to be here by 3:30.

67
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,876
Uh... Well, I guess
we'll go for a jog then.

68
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,378
Oh, go ahead-- just run away.

69
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,380
Just like every other
family gathering.

70
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:10,890
Poppy, those
are for Min Foo.

71
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,393
Oh. Is she going
to eat the whole jar?

72
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,394
(chuckling)

73
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,895
Well, when I
was pregnant

74
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,897
with Min Foo,

75
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,400
I used to crave dills
all the time.

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,902
Mmm.

77
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,404
(slurping)

78
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,906
Oh, Poppy!

79
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,907
Love it!

80
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,909
Oh, I want more.

81
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,411
(chuckling)

82
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,413
Hey, Min Foo, I came...
So, where is my mother?

83
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,914
Oh, there she is.

84
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,419
Oh.
Let me get your bag.

85
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm fine. I'm fine.

86
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,424
Hi!

87
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,925
Hi.
Hi.

88
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,429
Oh, see?

89
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,431
She doesn't want
to be here either.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,942
I don't know why we have to
celebrate Nono's engagement

91
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,944
to that... that
corporate lawyer.

92
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,448
Because she's your sister.

93
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,449
Oh, come on.

94
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,952
Help me set up
before Nono and Barry get here.

95
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,954
And here they are.

96
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,456
Hi, Barry.

97
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,957
Oh. Hi, sweetheart.

98
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,459
Hi.

99
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,461
And you
have got to be Peter.

100
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,462
I'm Rebecca.

101
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,963
Hey, you want
to come with me

102
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,465
and meet
your new cousins?

103
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,466
No.

104
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,967
Oh, come on.

105
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,470
Okay, a toast, everybody,
a toast.

106
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,473
To all of us
gathered together

107
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,476
in this glorious
spring weather.

108
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,479
Here she goes.

109
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,480
To Zeb

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,981
for scoping
out the site.

111
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,982
Cheers.

112
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:43,983
Thank you very much.

113
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,485
To Biddy,

114
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,486
for cooking

115
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,488
with all of
her might,

116
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,490
and Troy for helping
her get it right.

117
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,493
Um, to Patch

118
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,995
and Jeep for suggesting
the bats and the balls,

119
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,997
even though we never
use them at all.

120
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,501
To Hakim and Min Foo.

121
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,503
In August, they're due.

122
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,504
But most of all,

123
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,005
to Nono and Barry.

124
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,006
Oh.

125
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,008
We are so delighted

126
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,510
that they are going to marry.

127
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,512
(laughter)

128
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,014
Oh, and last
but not least,

129
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,016
a toast to Peter.

130
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,518
Someone new
in our family.

131
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,020
Oh, what
could be sweeter?

132
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,522
ALL:
To Peter.

133
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,524
I'm not in your family.

134
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,026
Oh. Better go get him

135
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,027
before he jumps
in the river.

136
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,029
BARRY:
Peter, get back here right now!

137
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,031
(people murmuring)

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,033
Peter, come on!

139
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,035
REBECCA:
Did you ever
have the feeling

140
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,537
you turned into
the wrong person?

141
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,040
ZEB:
Mmm... well, no.

142
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,542
I mean look at me--

143
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,044
after 20 years,
still a widow

144
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,046
planning other people's parties.

145
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:51,050
Don't read no more,
discuss important issues,

146
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,552
don't got no friends.

147
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,053
You've got friends.

148
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,555
You got the girls.

149
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,556
You've got me.

150
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,057
Yeah, relatives.

151
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,059
And everybody else I know
is some kind of repairman.

152
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,061
Relatives can be friends.

153
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,564
Repairmen,
I'm not so sure about.

154
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,065
Listen, I'm serious, Zeb.

155
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,067
What, what happened
to the friends

156
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,570
I knew in college
or in high school?

157
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,572
I mean, for instance,
Amy Darrow,

158
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,074
the girl
who had her engagement party

159
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,576
the day I met Joe right here.

160
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,079
Oh. I didn't even get
to her wedding.

161
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,582
Of course, I was married myself
by then,

162
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,084
and all three girls
had chicken pox, but still.

163
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,086
Okay, okay, to be continued.

164
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,089
I'm gonna make rounds
at the hospital tomorrow.

165
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,592
Okay. 'Night.

166
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,093
'Night.

167
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:42,518
(train whistle
and wind chimes)

168
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:45,521
(bell clanging)

169
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:01,037
REBECCA:
I had the oddest dream
last night.

170
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:03,539
Were there any numbers in it?

171
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,541
What?

172
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,044
If you can recall any numbers,

173
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:11,047
my friend Al is always after me
for numbers

174
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:12,548
to play the
lottery with.

175
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,550
He wants the numbers
from my dreams,

176
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,054
but I don't have
any dreams anymore.

177
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:23,559
No, this was a,
this was a dream about a boy.

178
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:27,063
And he seemed to be... my son.

179
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,564
I was on a train,

180
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,068
and I couldn't quite
see his face, but...

181
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:38,074
it seems that he was
very handsome... and confident.

182
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:40,076
Do you recall
what number train it was?

183
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:43,079
No. And I don't know
where we were going either.

184
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,581
(chuckling):
Well, I'd call that a dream

185
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,583
that was lacking in plot.

186
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,086
In fact,
it's sort of uninteresting.

187
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,088
So, I'd like
to switch

188
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,590
the subject to my birthday.

189
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,593
Your birthday's not
till December, Poppy.

190
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:58,594
December 11th.

191
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:03,099
I'm going to be100years old.

192
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,101
Well, I know
that, Poppy.

193
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,605
I suppose you're planning

194
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,107
some big wingding for me.

195
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,609
I mean,
I mean bigger than usual, huh?

196
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,611
Well, we'll see. Maybe.

197
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,113
(phone rings)

198
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,582
(chuckles):
Yes.

199
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,083
But it's still
pretty far away.

200
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,586
And when we get
a little closer...

201
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,592
Open Arms-- for all
of life's occasions.

202
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,593
Oh, yes, hi, Melinda.

203
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,094
Here's a list.

204
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,096
The guest list
for my birthday party.

205
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,598
REBECCA:
Oh, certainly.

206
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh, he... yeah,
he's a very good DJ.

207
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,604
Yup, he brings his
own sound system.

208
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,105
Oh, I'm sure he can play
whatever anyone would like.

209
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,107
Mom, it's me!

210
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,609
Not to worry.

211
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,610
Hi, Poppy!

212
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,613
Hi, Min Foo.

213
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,117
If you dreamed
you had a son

214
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,619
and not daughters,

215
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,120
and the boy was blonde
and not dark,

216
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,623
then you might
have been dreaming

217
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,624
how your life could be

218
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,626
if you had chosen
a different fork in the road--

219
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,630
if you'd decided on some
different kind of life.

220
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,133
Or, it probably means
my baby's going to be a boy.

221
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,636
No, Min Foo,
this is not about you.

222
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,639
And besides, he didn't have
your coloring.

223
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,140
He was blonde.

224
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,142
I could have
a blonde baby.

225
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,645
Half my genes are
yours, remember?

226
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,648
Well, yeah, maybe
with Joey's father.

227
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,650
But I seriously doubt
that you could hope

228
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,151
to have blonde genes with Hakim.

229
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,152
I know where this is going.

230
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,655
Before we start talking
about my choices in husbands,

231
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,156
I have an obstetrician to see.

232
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,157
Oh, honey, come on.

233
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,659
I wasn't implying anything

234
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,661
about your various husbands.

235
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,162
Yeah, right.

236
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,164
I got to go.

237
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,666
Bye, guys.

238
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,668
Bye, Mom.

239
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,671
Let's use these.

240
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,172
Oh, honey.

241
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,674
This is a graduation party.

242
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,675
Those are wedding bells.

243
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,677
Aw.

244
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,179
Hey, why don't we pretend
they're school bells?

245
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,681
Yay!
Okay.

246
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,682
Let's just make sure
they all work.

247
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,186
Ooh, pretty.

248
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,187
Nice.

249
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,689
Yeah.

250
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,692
You know that these
were strung across the room

251
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,694
the first time I ever came here?

252
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,198
? Hey, little woman,
please make up your mind ?

253
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,201
? You've got
to come into my world ?

254
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,704
? And leave your world behind ?

255
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
? Come on, now ?

256
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,206
? Na-na-na-na-na-na... ?

257
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,208
(laughing)

258
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,711
MAN:
I see you're having
a wonderful time.

259
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,712
Hi.

260
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,213
I'm Joe Davich.

261
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,216
That guy you're laughing at,
that's, uh,

262
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,218
my kid brother, Zeb.

263
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,221
I'm Rebecca Holmes.

264
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,723
I'm Amy's roommate.

265
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,224
Are you a friend
of Artie's?

266
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,226
Oh, no, no,
my family owns this place.

267
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,227
Oh.

268
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,729
Can I get you some champagne?

269
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,230
Oh. no, thank you,
I don't drink.

270
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,732
Well, we'll
have to find you

271
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,733
some ginger ale, then.

272
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,238
Oh! I am so sorry.

273
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,740
Come in the kitchen with me.

274
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,741
Joe, get the ham.

275
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,243
Wish I would
have known

276
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,244
you were coming.

277
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,746
Joe so seldom brings
his dates home.

278
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,247
I'm not his...
Of course,

279
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,248
you know Joe's children.

280
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,750
Children?

281
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,751
This is Nono

282
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,752
and Patch and Biddy.

283
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,754
And you've probably heard
the story.

284
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,256
Their mother Tina
escapes to New York City

285
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,258
and dumps the whole crew on me.

286
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,261
Mommy's going to be a
famous nightclub singer.

287
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,763
So some would have us believe.

288
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,264
Here, Mother.

289
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,766
A little soap and water,

290
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,767
and no one
will ever know.

291
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,268
Right.

292
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,770
Let's clean off
those shoes, huh?

293
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,271
Okay.

294
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,773
Mommy has

295
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,274
this beautiful dress

296
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,276
where the straps
are made of diamonds.

297
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,779
Really?

298
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,788
There. Good as new.

299
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,289
Thanks.
Come on.

300
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,791
MOTHER:
Where are you
taking her?

301
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,292
Don't worry,
we'll see her again.

302
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,294
Okay, guys.

303
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,295
Oh, sweetie, that-that,

304
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,297
that's really
a lot of raisins.

305
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,300
Uh...

306
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,303
we will be seeing you, won't we?

307
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,812
I'm gonna have love
at first sight, too.

308
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,314
Oh, I hope
you do, dear.

309
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,321
We finished just
a few hours ago.

310
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,323
Well...

311
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,825
Isn't that
lovely?

312
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,826
Oh, yeah.

313
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,327
Here's the problem.

314
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,330
Katie didn't graduate.

315
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,832
She didn't graduate?

316
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,333
No.

317
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,335
I was laying out
her clothes this morning

318
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,337
and suddenly Katie
turned to me

319
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,340
and she said,
"Oh, did I mention

320
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,341
I flunked chemistry?"

321
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,343
At the time, I failed
to understand

322
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,346
that flunking chemistry would
keep her from graduating,

323
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,348
but it-it did and...

324
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,850
Well, listen.

325
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,852
Isn't it fortunate that you
already planned this party?

326
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,354
It sends such a message.

327
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,856
A message?

328
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,857
Yeah, a message--

329
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,358
that you love
and you support

330
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,360
your daughter in spite
of her failure.

331
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,862
Oh.

332
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,864
But my friends.

333
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,365
How will I face them?

334
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,869
Oh, did-did you read that report
a few years ago?

335
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,871
Oh, my, it was, um...

336
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,875
Scientists actually discovered
that if you fake a smile

337
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,378
that your, uh, smile muscles,

338
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,382
they just somehow trigger
a signal to your brain,

339
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,886
and you start to feel
the way you pretended to feel.

340
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,388
Yeah, really. Happy.

341
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,890
(chuckles)

342
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,392
Well, I suppose it
is kind of difficult

343
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,894
to cancel at this late date.

344
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,395
But I-I-I thought maybe...

345
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,898
You know, Katie's
such a lucky girl.

346
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,900
ZEB:
Nice save, Beck.

347
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,401
How do you manage
to pull these things off?

348
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,904
Well, it's not like
I ever had a choice.

349
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,406
What is that supposed to mean?

350
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,407
Oh, never mind.

351
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,409
You know, maybe I should
get myself a dog.

352
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,911
I mean, if I had
a dog to walk,

353
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,913
it would be easier
to meet people, right?

354
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,915
Maybe you should just get away

355
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,416
from the Open Arms
for a while.

356
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,417
Go somewhere,

357
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,919
visit someone.

358
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,420
Yeah, well that's my point.

359
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,421
Who would I visit?

360
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,423
Surely you can
think of someone.

361
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,425
REBECCA:
Mother, I have to leave

362
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,928
first thing in the morning.

363
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,929
But you just got here.

364
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:07,930
Yeah, but I
have a big

365
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,932
anniversary party
at the Open Arms.

366
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,433
Oh, that place.

367
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,936
Oh, darling, no.

368
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,940
That place is how
I make my money.

369
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,441
What little there is of it.

370
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,443
That's the Daviches' business.

371
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,446
No, actually
it's mine.

372
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,448
And there's Poppy
to think about.

373
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,951
Oh, that old man.

374
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,452
Is he still
alive?

375
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,955
Yes, he's still alive.

376
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,457
Exactly how are you related?

377
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,459
He's Joe's father's
twin brother.

378
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,461
You know that, Mother.

379
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,963
Darling.

380
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,465
You could have done
so much better.

381
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,466
Like how?

382
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,968
Oh, you were such

383
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,469
a brilliant
student, Rebecca.

384
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,472
Do you remember that
paper on Robert E. Lee?

385
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,473
Didn't the professor say

386
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,976
that you could expand it
into an honors project?

387
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,477
Well, he suggested
that I...

388
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,979
And before you got started,

389
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,481
bang, here comes Joe Davich and
puts you to work.

390
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,482
Mother...

391
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
And poor
Will Allenby.

392
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,985
He didn't
know

393
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,986
what hit him.

394
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,487
One day you were
as good as engaged,

395
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,489
and the next you up
and married a man

396
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,490
that nobody knew from Adam.

397
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,992
I made a choice.

398
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,494
Well, it was
the wrong choice.

399
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:16,999
You and Will Allenby
were soul mates.

400
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,504
You've been a different woman
ever since you jilted Will.

401
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:30,512
(bell tolling)

402
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,535
POPPY:
Rebecca!

403
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,537
Where were you?

404
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,040
(phone ringing)
You knew where I was, Poppy.

405
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,041
I was at
my mother's.

406
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,043
Oh, is she
still alive?

407
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,544
Is that Biddy?

408
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,047
It's not like I wasn't
gonna tell you.

409
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,549
Why doesn't anybody
answer this? Hello?

410
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,053
Uh, uh, Open Arms, for
all of life's occasions.

411
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,554
You've always
hated my cooking.

412
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,556
Yeah?
That's not true.

413
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,058
Tomorrow night at 8:00.
Besides, we just
want you

414
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,060
That's right
to be able to enjoy
the wedding.

415
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,561
All right, well, we'll be very
happy to see you then.
Oh, please.

416
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,564
Yes. Bye-bye.

417
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,566
What was that all about?

418
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,567
Oh, she's mad
because

419
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,069
I don't want her
to do the food.

420
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,070
Barry and I just want

421
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,072
a more
straightforward menu.

422
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,574
And besides, Biddy's never done
a garden wedding before.

423
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,076
Who's having
a garden wedding?

424
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,577
We are. Here.

425
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,578
Mother suggested it.

426
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,080
I think it's
a great idea.

427
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,082
Oh, Tina suggested it.

428
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,586
Oh, is Tina doing
the landscaping?

429
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,088
Of course not--
Mother doesn't arrive

430
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,089
until two days
before the wedding.

431
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,091
Aha. I see.

432
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,592
We can do
it, Beck.

433
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:55,097
I am a florist,
after all.

434
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,602
(horn honks)

435
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,608
(car doors slam)

436
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,610
(several people talking
at once)

437
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,112
Mother's here!

438
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:17,119
(all talking at once)

439
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,621
Oh, Rachel. Dear!

440
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,123
Rebecca.

441
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,625
Mother brought us
gifts from London.

442
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,128
Oh. Nice.

443
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,132
Oh, Mother,
please.

444
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,140
Oh, Mother, I love them.

445
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,141
For your chignon.

446
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,642
Oh.

447
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,144
Oh, thank you so much.

448
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,645
It's about 1812.

449
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,649
All that tea with
this instant family.

450
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,650
Mother, this
is perfect.

451
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,152
Oh, do you like it?
I found it in Capri.

452
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Mother, I love it.

453
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,156
Min Foo, she's
not your mother.

454
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,658
Oh, I-I just...

455
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,160
Oh, Minerva, I've
always thought of you

456
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,162
as my fourth daughter,
haven't I?

457
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,164
Rebecca, come,
come, come.

458
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,665
You haven't opened
your present yet.

459
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,667
Oh. Okay.

460
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,171
Oh. An apron.

461
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,673
I thought something useful.

462
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,175
Thank you.

463
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:19,181
Now, Barry, tell me all
about the wedding plans.

464
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,183
Well, we finally
found a minister.

465
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,185
Nono and I were
at a restaurant
the other night

466
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,686
Mm-hmm.
wondering who we
could get to marry us,

467
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,689
and our waitress said,
"Well, I can do that."

468
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,692
So, what'll it be?

469
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,194
Do you, like, take
this woman here

470
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,695
to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

471
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,696
Oh, you're
joking.

472
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,697
Turns out she has
some kind

473
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,199
of certificate
she sent away for

474
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,200
through
the mail.

475
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,201
You didn't
tell me this.

476
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,202
It's...

477
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,203
Perfectly legal,
and she said

478
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,204
she'd do it
for free.

479
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,205
Oh, well.
Why not?

480
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,206
It's all a big
charade,

481
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,710
anyhow, I mean, my singing
teacher was devastated

482
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,711
when I married
Joe, I mean,

483
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,712
"My dear, you
are throwing away

484
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,713
a God-given talent."

485
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,716
I mean, marriage may be useful

486
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,719
during those little
child-bearing years,

487
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,722
but, all that, "My darling,
aren't you amazing?"

488
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,724
gives away to blood
pressure monitoring

489
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,226
and hand holding when
the man retires

490
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,228
and he can't think what
to do with themselves.

491
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,730
And the wives, meanwhile, start
longing to get free

492
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,733
from this institution
invented by males

493
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,734
for their own benefit.

494
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,736
It's all a primitive
tribal ritual,

495
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,238
meant to make us forget

496
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,740
we're merely propagating
the species.

497
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,743
(man clearing throat)

498
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,745
She certainly knows

499
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,748
the right thing to say
to a bride and groom.

500
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,251
(phone dialing)

501
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,259
Oh, hello.

502
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,760
Is this Alumni Records?

503
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,263
This is Rebecca
Holmes Davich.

504
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,264
I'm looking for

505
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,267
a, um, an address of
a classmate, Allenby.

506
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,270
Will Allenby. Yeah.

507
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,772
Oh, Dr.Allenby.

508
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,275
He teaches there?

509
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,277
Ah. Okay.

510
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,779
Oh, good.

511
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,781
All right.
Thanks very much.

512
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,283
Okay, bye-bye.

513
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,801
(sighs)

514
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,815
I can't believe
Uncle Poppy's

515
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,317
still here.

516
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,819
He was always such a bore.

517
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,323
I mean, all the Daviches,
a bunch of mopers.

518
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,325
How ironic
their profession

519
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,327
was throwing
parties.

520
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,328
I mean, just
because your house

521
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,330
has 14 foot ceilings
doesn't automatically

522
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,833
turn you into
a social butterfly.

523
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:56,838
I don't know how you've managed
all these years.

524
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,341
I just put one foot
in front of the other.

525
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,343
You don't have any,
shall we say,

526
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,345
man friends, I suppose.

527
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,346
No.

528
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,847
Well, of
course not.

529
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,350
After baby-sitting
Joe Davich,

530
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,851
why would you want one?

531
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,354
Yes, why would I?

532
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,359
Oh. Ah.

533
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,361
This place is like
a time machine.

534
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,863
Same old sink.

535
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:25,367
Same sticky wooden cabinets.

536
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,872
Same scummy little
drinking glasses.

537
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,880
Same rusty screen door.

538
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,389
Why, how American.

539
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,391
Instant lawn!

540
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,893
I knew we could
create a garden here.

541
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,399
Very impressive.

542
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,401
Thanks a lot.

543
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,404
Been working out every day.

544
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,906
Oh.

545
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,421
(playing traditional
introduction)

546
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:47,449
(piano continues over monitor)

547
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,451
She's so cute.

548
00:22:55,957 --> 00:23:01,463
("Wedding March"
plays on piano)

549
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,464
Oh...

550
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,980
Oh...

551
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,487
Today we are gathered here

552
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,489
to witness
a celebration

553
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,990
of the human
family.

554
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,493
The uniting

555
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,495
of two people
in marriage.

556
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,998
Nono and Barry come
before us here today

557
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,502
to...
be united in marriage.

558
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,004
Theirs is a love

559
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,506
that springs from
the affection

560
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,509
of those who loved
them into being.

561
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,515
And to that source,
let us all turn and ask,

562
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,017
who gives this woman?

563
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,021
Oh.

564
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,023
Me.

565
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,526
(chuckles)

566
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,529
London, well...

567
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,531
Our mother's
actually flirting

568
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,532
with her new
son-in-law.

569
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,033
Nono's about to kill her.

570
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,034
She was telling Barry

571
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,536
they ought to take Peter
on their honeymoon.

572
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,539
Every time, you
girls can't wait

573
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,541
for your mother
to get here.

574
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,543
Now you can't wait
for her to leave.

575
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,546
Oh, I told Nono
that Peter could stay here.

576
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,048
Is that cake a little slanted?

577
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,050
What do you mean?
Well, look.

578
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,052
Hmm.

579
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,554
Well, what do you expect?

580
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,055
First Nono doesn't even want me

581
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,057
to cater the wedding,
then she does.

582
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,059
I mean, she's lucky
there's a cake at all.

583
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,060
Oh, honey,
it's a lovely cake.

584
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,062
It just needs a little...

585
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,566
Peter, I have
a job for you.

586
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,568
No. I can't.

587
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,069
Oh, yes, of
course you can.

588
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,572
You just-just
be creative.

589
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,575
And we're smiling,
and we're smiling.

590
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,076
Yes, and we're smiling.

591
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,077
Um...

592
00:24:56,077 --> 00:25:00,081
Sir, um, you're-you're
in the shot.

593
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,082
Can you...?
Yeah, okay.

594
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,584
Oh.
Thank you.

595
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,086
You did a great job
with those strawberries.

596
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,589
PHOTOGRAPHER:
We're smiling
and we're smiling.

597
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,592
Nice.

598
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,093
(whistling)

599
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,094
Okay, everyone.

600
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,096
Everyone, group
photo, group photo.

601
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,598
Yes, group photo. Okay.

602
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,600
That's right.

603
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,604
Okay, um, will the people
who are not related

604
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,607
by blood-- can you move
to the sides, please?

605
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,609
I can't get you all
into the picture.

606
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,611
That'd be us.
We'll just...

607
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,617
Oh, Beck, Peter, come on.

608
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,618
Come on, Beck.

609
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,120
Oh, all right.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
We're smiling, and...

610
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,622
Quickly.

611
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,124
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay.

612
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,628
Smiles, and we're smiling,
and we're smiling.

613
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:55,604
(crickets chirping)

614
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,109
(phone rings)

615
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,611
Dr. Allenby.

616
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,612
Will.

617
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,613
Laura?

618
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,114
Who?

619
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:27,619
Will, this is, uh,
Rebecca Holmes Davich.

620
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,121
Rebecca?

621
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,625
Oh, gosh, I... I hope
you weren't asleep.

622
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,127
No, no, no, no, no, no.

623
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,129
I know it's...
I know it's late, uh...

624
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,633
Oh, my, I didn't realize
how late.

625
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,134
You know, um, in fact,

626
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,637
I think that I'll just call back
another time.

627
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,639
B-B-Bye-bye.

628
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,144
Ay-yi-yi. Oh, no.

629
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,146
(phone rings)

630
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,149
Open Arms,
for all of life's occasions.

631
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,651
Yes, yes, that's right.

632
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,652
The Tea Dance starts

633
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,153
at 4:30 tomorrow.

634
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,655
You're welcome.
Who's he?

635
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,159
It's Peter Sanborn, Poppy.

636
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,661
He's staying
here with us

637
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,663
while Nono and Barry
are on their honeymoon.

638
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,164
Oh...
Remember?

639
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:17,168
Mm. Do you remember
Nono's wedding cake?

640
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,670
Yeah, I remember.

641
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,674
You know how it kind of...
it kind of...

642
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,676
it-it kind of tilted?

643
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,678
Mm, yeah.

644
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,681
Well, I don't feel that cakes
are Biddy's strong point,

645
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,683
so I'd like you to find
somebody else

646
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,184
to make my birthday cake.

647
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,687
I'll be 100 years old.

648
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,189
(chuckling):
December 11.

649
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,192
Mm...

650
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,197
Taking that to
your room, huh?

651
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,701
Yeah, I think I will.

652
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:55,206
Hey, how about you and I
go out for some ice cream, huh?

653
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,207
Get some fresh air?

654
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,710
No thanks.

655
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,211
How 'bout a game?

656
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:05,216
Uh, Clue, Checkers,
Monopoly, Scrabble, huh?

657
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,218
We can't tell your dad
you didn't do one thing

658
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,221
the whole time
you were here.
I don't care.

659
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,725
Well, I do. Come on.

660
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,728
I wish I hadn't promised Poppy
this party.

661
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,230
He'll forget it before
the balloons have shriveled...

662
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,234
...maybe the instant
it's over.

663
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,235
He could enjoy
the party

664
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,737
while it's
happening, though,

665
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,239
even if he did
forget it later.

666
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,242
Yeah.

667
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,245
Well, you're right
about that.

668
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,748
Hmm.

669
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,252
Guess this

670
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,255
is about all I can do.

671
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,258
Whoa. Ho, ho, ho.

672
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,260
60 points.

673
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,264
Hey, I suspect
you might be a hustler.

674
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,767
(phone ringing)

675
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,273
Open Arms, for all
of life's occasions.

676
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,775
Rebecca speaking.

677
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,777
This is Will Allenby.

678
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,280
Will.

679
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,282
H-How'd you get my number?

680
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,785
I looked at my caller ID.

681
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,787
Anyway, Rebecca...

682
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,290
...what did you call me for?

683
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,294
Oh, gosh, I, you know,
I just h-happened to be home--

684
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,797
I mean, at... at Mom's,
and-and she and I

685
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,298
just got talking
about old times,

686
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,800
and I thought to myself,

687
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,303
"Gee, wonder whatever happened
to... Will Allenby?

688
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,805
Wonder where he got to."

689
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,308
Oh. Well, I'm...

690
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,311
right here, where you left me...

691
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,313
at MacAdam, that is.

692
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,816
Well, no, I haven't been here
the whole time.

693
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,819
I... I did go away
for my doctorate.

694
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,321
Um, I teach here now.

695
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,823
Oh, that's wonderful, Will.

696
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,825
I'm the head
of the Physics Department.

697
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,327
Well, that's really wonderful.

698
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,329
Well, you know, it's been
such a long time.

699
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,832
Maybe-maybe you and I
should just get together,

700
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,333
you know, catch up, or...

701
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,336
I... I happen to be free
this evening.

702
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,337
Oh, this evening?

703
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,839
Oh, no, I-I couldn't do that,

704
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,841
'cause I've got a tea dance,
and then...

705
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,343
Oh, boy. This weekend,
I got a funeral,

706
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,346
and I got, uh,
an engagement party, but, um...

707
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,349
Well, what about Monday,
uh, um, at that place?

708
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,351
Is it still there?
The, um...

709
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,853
What is it, the Maple Tree?

710
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,856
It's here. I-I don't know
if it's still good, uh...

711
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,358
Well, why don't we just say
7:00, the Maple Tree?

712
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,860
All right.

713
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,362
Okay, good.
See you then.

714
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,368
That was my very first
boyfriend.

715
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,871
Well, my only
boyfriend,

716
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,873
besides Joe Davich.

717
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,876
(bell tolls)

718
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,391
(birds chirping)

719
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,895
Oh, good.
That's right.

720
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,396
Well, thanks for
watching him, honey.

721
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,898
That's okay.

722
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,401
He didn't play
with the kids at all.

723
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,903
He just sat reading a book

724
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,404
the whole time.

725
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,907
There's nothing wrong with that.

726
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,414
Why the sudden urge
to go shopping?

727
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,917
Oh, nothing, I'm
just sick of the
same old clothes.

728
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:26,918
Time for some
new ones.

729
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,919
Well, I'd better
get back.

730
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,420
(engine starts)

731
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,922
Bye, Peter.

732
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,423
Bye.

733
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:44,435
I decided not to tell
Min Foo about my date.

734
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,938
It's none of
her business.

735
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,442
Besides, it's not
really a date.

736
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,448
I used to love to read
when I was young.

737
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,951
I was quite an
intellectual,

738
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,952
like you.

739
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,961
If you were offered a trip
on a time machine,

740
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,462
would you take it?

741
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,964
Oh, I sure would.

742
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,966
I'd be crazy not to.

743
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,968
Would you go into the past
or the future?

744
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:17,969
The future.

745
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,972
Absolutely the future,

746
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,974
'cause I want to know
what's going to happen.

747
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,477
Yeah, me too.

748
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,483
(doorbell rings)

749
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,485
MAN:
Hello? Rebecca!

750
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,487
Oh, J.J.

751
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,989
Rebecca!

752
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,492
Oh, J.J., I'm so happy
you're here.

753
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,494
Boy, that ceiling
really needs to be patched.

754
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,496
Well, we'll do that.

755
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,998
REBECCA:
Yeah.

756
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,000
Mm. Oh.

757
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,502
Yeah, well, I-I'm
having dinner

758
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,005
with my old high school
sweetheart on Monday,

759
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,507
and I'm-I'm just as
nervous as a cat on a...

760
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,510
(chuckles):
You know, Tanya was my, uh,
high school sweetheart.

761
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,512
Really? My gosh.

762
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,014
You two really made
a go of it, huh?

763
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,017
Yeah.
Well, not that you haven't
had to... work at it.

764
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,019
Ain't that the truth?

765
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,021
Will you just give
it a little...?

766
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,522
Sure.

767
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,525
Yeah. No good, huh?

768
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,028
Well... the color's nice.
Mm.

769
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,031
W-w-w-what about those, uh,
harem pants you had on

770
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,533
the-the time I was patching
the bathroom?
Oh, no, no, no.

771
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,035
I-I don't want to wear
pants to a restaurant,

772
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,536
and, besides,
they didn't make...

773
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,538
(whispering):
Weren't good
for my derriere.

774
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,540
(laughing)

775
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,543
But... the color's nice.

776
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,054
Oh, Poppy, your tapioca's
in the fridge.

777
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,555
Uh-huh.
And don't forget

778
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,557
your penguin
program's on at 9:00.

779
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,558
Okay. I won't forget.

780
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,060
Night-night.
Yeah.

781
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,061
Have fun.

782
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,562
Okay.

783
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,565
Uh-huh. Mm. Yum.

784
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,577
Good evening.

785
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,079
Oh. Hi.

786
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,581
I'm meeting someone here.
I don't suppose...

787
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,583
Would that be him?

788
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,088
Uh, no.

789
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,593
Oh... I... William.

790
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,603
Hello, Will.

791
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,605
Hi.

792
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,107
Oh.

793
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,109
What happened to your
long golden braid?

794
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,111
My what? Oh, my gosh.

795
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,612
I got... I cut that off
long ago.

796
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,614
It was too much trouble.

797
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,116
May I tell Marvin

798
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,118
what you're having to drink?

799
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,619
Who's Marvin?

800
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,121
Iced tea, please.

801
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:54,625
Oh. I'll just have, um...

802
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,127
w-water, thank you.

803
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,628
Sparkling or still?

804
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,129
Pardon?

805
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,131
Tap, I think. Right?

806
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,133
Yes, tap.

807
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,136
It is so good to see you, Will.

808
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,638
Me too.

809
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:12,143
I mean, it's good for me
to see you, too.

810
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,644
Except for the braid,

811
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,646
you... you look
just the same.

812
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:19,150
Oh, no, no, I haven't
changed a bit. Ha, ha.

813
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,651
So, decided what you're having?

814
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,153
Well, not quite.

815
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,654
Oh, I-I-I'm sorry.

816
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,657
I'll see what I should be
having here.

817
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,160
Oh, you should go first,
Rebecca.

818
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,662
Oh. All right. Yes. Oops.

819
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,164
Oh, dear. Well, salmon's...

820
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,665
Uh, you have salmon,
I'm sure, don't you?

821
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,667
I always liked that.

822
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,170
That's it.
Thank you very much.

823
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,674
Okay, uh, salmon,
veal, rib roast...

824
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,176
Uh, maybe the rib roast?

825
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,678
And how would you like that
cooked?

826
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,681
Well done.
Thank you very much. Yeah.

827
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,683
Well done it is.

828
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,685
Or, uh, you know...

829
00:35:54,685 --> 00:36:00,191
how 'bout the award, uh,
winning, uh, swordfish?

830
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,692
Swordfish.

831
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,194
U-unless...

832
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,696
would it actually be
the award-winning swordfish

833
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:06,697
if it didn't have

834
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,199
the sauce?

835
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,200
(laughs)

836
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,203
So, the swordfish,
no sauce,

837
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,705
and salad, no dressing,
thank you.

838
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,208
(clears throat)

839
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,712
Sorry, uh, I don't
eat out often.

840
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,214
I-I cook for myself.

841
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,715
Oh.

842
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,716
I make my
famous chili.

843
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,718
You remember my chili.

844
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,221
Oh, your chili.

845
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,222
Yes, right, of course.

846
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,723
The way I
prepare it

847
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,727
is, every Sunday,
I mix up two batches and then

848
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,229
divide them up into
seven containers.

849
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,230
And that's what

850
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,232
I'd eat each night for the week.

851
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,233
For the whole week?

852
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,234
Mm-hmm.

853
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,235
All week?

854
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,736
Yeah.

855
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,239
Of course, now I have
an extra container,

856
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,240
because of tonight.

857
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,242
I don't know how I'll
deal with that yet.

858
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,743
My, my.

859
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,246
Well, it sure sounds
like you've adjusted

860
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,748
to-to living by yourself.

861
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,251
I mean... since your divorce.

862
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,253
I can't complain.

863
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,255
I mean,
I-I rent a very nice apartment.

864
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,756
Mm-hmm.

865
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,258
It's even got a little s-study

866
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,760
that could be made
into a guest room,

867
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,763
and if my...

868
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,766
if my daughter ever wanted
to spend the night over.

869
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,768
Oh, well, you have a daughter?

870
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,769
Yes, a 17-year-old

871
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,271
high school senior.

872
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,272
Oh.

873
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,773
Beatrice.

874
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:23,774
Of course that...

875
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,776
That's nothing
compared to you.

876
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,278
Uh-uh.

877
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,279
No, that's right.

878
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,281
(laughing):
I... I'm way ahead of you.

879
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,282
I've got five grandchildren.

880
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,284
Hmm.
But that's
because my husband's

881
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,786
three girls are older,
from a previous marriage.

882
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:40,791
H-How did he pass away,
if-if you don't mind my asking?

883
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,794
No.

884
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,796
In a car wreck.

885
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,299
Ha. Oh, boy.
It was really sudden.

886
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:52,803
Well, of course,
a car wreck is a-always sudden.

887
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,305
It was just...

888
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,307
I was just so unprepared,
you know.

889
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,310
Mm. 26 years old.

890
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,812
And his girls had just adjusted

891
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,814
to the fact that I even existed.

892
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,316
(laughs)

893
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,818
Oh. Well, I'm not sure
I'd know how to deal with that.

894
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,819
I managed all right.

895
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,821
We... We were fine.

896
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,825
Thank you.

897
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,333
It seems so long ago,
doesn't it?

898
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,338
You broke my heart, Rebecca.

899
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,843
I mean, no warning.

900
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,346
I mean, I thought
everything was fine,

901
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:39,350
and then, you just
said good-bye

902
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,352
without a
reason why.

903
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,855
I had to hear
that you got married

904
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,857
two weeks later, from my mother.

905
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,360
Yeah. I'm... I'm...

906
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,861
I'm sorry.

907
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:51,862
You know, I-I...

908
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:55,866
I know I didn't handle that
very well, but, uh...

909
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,868
Everything
to your liking, folks?
Yes, uh,

910
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:58,869
everything's fine,
thank you.

911
00:38:58,869 --> 00:38:59,870
Yeah.

912
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,873
I-I know
that I should have written,

913
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,876
but, uh, everything was just
moving so fast, you know.

914
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,877
And I just seemed

915
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,379
to be getting farther
and farther away

916
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,380
from my original self.

917
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,382
And then, this summer,
I just sort of...

918
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,383
I don't know.

919
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,385
I just sort of woke up,
and I thought,

920
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,388
"Who have you turned into?"

921
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,389
(sighs)

922
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,893
And that's why
I called you. I...

923
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,396
Oh, yeah.

924
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,899
Figured you could just
waltz right on back as if

925
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:29,900
you'd never
even left?

926
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,902
No, I never thought that.
Thought I'd
say, "Oh,

927
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,404
"sure, Rebecca.

928
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,405
"I forgive you for everything.

929
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,906
"Let's go back

930
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,408
to, uh, the
good old days."

931
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,910
No, no, no.
I never thought that at all.

932
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,412
I trusted you.

933
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,416
I'm really sorry...

934
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,919
I can see
this has been a mistake.

935
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:00,431
MAN (on television):
Preening can be a part
of the breeding behavior.

936
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,433
Among couples,
it is sign of love

937
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,935
when they clean each other's
feathers.

938
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,937
(sighs)

939
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,439
(snoring)

940
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,940
As soon as penguins
are out of the water,

941
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,443
they start cleaning
and combing their feathers.

942
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:16,447
Unlike his Antarctic neighbors,
the penguin mates for life.

943
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,457
The pains are five minutes
apart.

944
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,958
Oh.

945
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,460
Oh, honey.

946
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,463
Just remind yourself
that you're gonna get

947
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,464
a baby out of this.

948
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,469
Bye, Mommy.

949
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,471
I bet that you are gonna have
a brand new brother

950
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,972
or sister before lunchtime.

951
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,976
Min Foo is having a baby?

952
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,978
I thought she was divorced.

953
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,481
Poppy, she divorced
Professor Drake.

954
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,483
And then she divorced LaVon.

955
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,485
And then she married Hakim.

956
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:55,986
Hakim?

957
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,988
(laughing):
Oh, good God.

958
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,490
An-An Arab?

959
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,491
(phone ringing)

960
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,494
Poppy.

961
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,496
Open Arms. F-for...

962
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,998
O-Oh. Hi. Yes, yes, J.J.

963
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,500
Yeah, well, I'm afraid

964
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,502
that faucet still is leaky,
but listen, J.J.,

965
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,003
Min Foo's having
her baby today.

966
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,004
Yeah. So, I got to...

967
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,006
Oh, oh, your-your
daughter-in-law, too.

968
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,508
Oh, that's great.

969
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,509
Well, then you can understand

970
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,010
why I got to keep the line free.

971
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,011
All right. Bye, bye, thanks.

972
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,012
Ooh.

973
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,013
You said

974
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,515
we'd have a
new brother

975
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,516
or sister before
lunchtime.

976
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,517
Is Mommy okay?

977
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,519
Oh, yes.
Of course she is.

978
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,021
And, you know,
sometimes...

979
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,024
Just move your little drawings,
kids, for me.

980
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,027
Sometimes it just takes
a little bit longer.

981
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:40,531
Oh, you did a lovely job
on those candles.

982
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,533
Let's light 'em up.

983
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,536
Razzle dazzle time. Whoo!

984
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,537
(phone ringing)

985
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:50,040
If I could undo one
modern invention,

986
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,542
it would be the telephone.

987
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,043
I would choose the zipper.

988
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,545
(laughs)

989
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,047
(laughter)

990
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,549
Open...

991
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,550
WILL:
Rebecca? It's Will.

992
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,551
Oh, Will.

993
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,554
Uh, I really... I... I'm...

994
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,557
I don't know
why you rushed off like that.

995
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:10,060
The-The waiter was wondering
if anything was wrong.

996
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,062
And I... I'm worried

997
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,565
that you might have
misunderstood me.

998
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,567
Oh, Will, listen, thank you
so much for calling me.

999
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,569
Listen, my daughter's
about to have a baby,

1000
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,570
and I really can't talk.

1001
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,071
Uh, thanks.

1002
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,072
Okay. I...

1003
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,075
(dial tone)

1004
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,077
Oh, boy.

1005
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,579
(phone rings)

1006
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,080
(groans)

1007
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,582
Open Ar... Hakim?

1008
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,084
Yes?Whoo!

1009
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:37,087
Yes, I think Abdul's
a wonderful name for a boy.

1010
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,089
Yay!
Yay!

1011
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,091
Oh.

1012
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,593
Come over here.

1013
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,594
(baby coos)

1014
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,596
Oh, handsome boy.

1015
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,597
Look at you.

1016
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,098
Look at you.

1017
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,099
You're so beautiful.

1018
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,602
Welcome to
the world, Abdul.

1019
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,603
Say hi to Grandma.

1020
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,104
(laughter)

1021
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,606
(keys jangling)

1022
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,108
(door creaking)

1023
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,117
(beep)

1024
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:11,121
Rebecca, it's Will Allenby
again.

1025
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,124
I trust everything's fine
with your daughter's baby.

1026
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,628
I, uh... I just wanted
to apologize

1027
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,630
for the other evening.

1028
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,634
Lately, it's been all I can do
to just get up in the morning.

1029
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,636
I look in the mirror and think,

1030
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,138
"Gosh, same old me."

1031
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,643
(beep)

1032
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,146
Lord in heaven,
tell me everything.

1033
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,650
Well, Will has been divorced
about two years now.

1034
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,651
Perfect.

1035
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,152
If a man is divorced,

1036
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,655
he's always angry
at his ex-wife.

1037
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,657
But if he's widowed,

1038
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,660
he always feels guilty
about remarrying.

1039
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,662
Mother, who said anything
about remarrying?

1040
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,164
We're just having
a meal together.

1041
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,167
That should put us back here
about 9:30 or 10:00.

1042
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,168
Is that enough time?

1043
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,170
Oh, yeah, that's-that's
plenty of time.

1044
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,171
Thanks, Zeb.

1045
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,674
Oh, Beck, so,
is this a...

1046
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,676
Is this an actual
date you're having?

1047
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,678
No. I'm much too old
to be dating.

1048
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:08,679
(laughter)

1049
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,180
Okay, Poppy.

1050
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,181
Oh.

1051
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,683
Mm. Don't you two get
into any trouble.

1052
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,184
Okay.
Too old to be dating...

1053
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,688
(laughter)

1054
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,692
(doorbell rings)

1055
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,199
Oh.

1056
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,209
Whoa.

1057
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,711
Oh, you shouldn't have.

1058
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,212
I know I'm early.

1059
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,716
I allowed a little extra time,
in case I got lost.

1060
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,218
Come on in.

1061
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,722
Oh. My goodness.

1062
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,723
Let's see.

1063
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,225
Um, why don't
we set it down

1064
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,226
right over here.

1065
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,229
Whoo. Here you go.

1066
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,232
Ah.

1067
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,233
(laughs)

1068
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,736
My, isn't that...

1069
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,237
Isn't that unusual.

1070
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,238
Yeah.

1071
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,239
And what's it called?

1072
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,742
I don't know.

1073
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,244
They said it
was impossible
to kill, is all.

1074
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,245
(laughs):
Oh, good.

1075
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,246
Well, I guess

1076
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,248
I should have dressed
up a little more, huh?

1077
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,750
Oh, no. I'm not so dressed up.

1078
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,753
Oh, this is,
uh, very...

1079
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,255
Well, this is quite a place
you have.

1080
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,757
Well, don't
let it fool ya.

1081
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,258
I expect the ceiling
to fall down any...

1082
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,760
any minute now.

1083
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,263
Well, I mean, it's...
it's really impressive.

1084
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,765
It must have quite a...

1085
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,767
(doorbell rings)

1086
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:37,768
Yeah?

1087
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,769
Uh, quite a history to it.

1088
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,270
Mm-hmm.

1089
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,772
Um, I...

1090
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,274
I believe your doorbell rang.

1091
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,776
Oh, yes, right.

1092
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,779
Well, just make
yourself at home.

1093
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,288
Hi, J.J.
Hi.

1094
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,790
I just wanted to let you know

1095
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,291
that we're gonna be out
in the back,

1096
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,793
uh, planting those a... azal...

1097
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,294
Okay. Fine.

1098
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,296
Wha-What is that?

1099
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,298
(whispering):
You know, I'm not sure exactly.

1100
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,800
I-I-I've never seen anything
like it.

1101
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,801
Thanks, J.J.

1102
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,803
Hey, you-you want
to take a peek at them

1103
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,304
before we start planting?

1104
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,305
No, it's fine, it's fine.

1105
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,306
How about I fetch you one
of those,

1106
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,808
uh, hang tags
with a color photo?

1107
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,809
You know,
I really don't care, J.J.

1108
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,811
I've got company.

1109
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,814
Oh.

1110
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,315
High school sweetheart.

1111
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,818
(chuckles)

1112
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:32,823
Was this your husband?

1113
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,825
(laughs)

1114
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,328
N-No, no.

1115
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,831
We got that at
a garage sale.

1116
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,332
Oh.

1117
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:45,836
Come on, I'll show you
what my husband looked like.

1118
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,341
Oh, uh... Oh, here.

1119
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,843
(phone rings)

1120
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,344
I'll-I'll just
let the...

1121
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:55,345
the machine get that.

1122
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,347
Now, he's here
somewhere, but...

1123
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,349
Oh, well here's my
newest grandson, Abdul.

1124
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,353
And here he is with his mother,
Min Foo, my daughter.

1125
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,855
(phone continues ringing)

1126
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,857
And this is my eldest
stepdaughter, Biddy,

1127
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,359
standing next
to Min Foo's ex, LaVon.

1128
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,863
And that's Nono.

1129
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,865
Oh, doesn't she make
a beautiful bride?

1130
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:15,866
And let's see.

1131
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,367
This is Patch.

1132
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,368
She's celebrating

1133
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,871
the girls lacrosse team
winning State.

1134
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,373
And, uh...

1135
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,875
Oh. There's Joe.

1136
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:38,388
Yes. Well, you

1137
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,891
always did want
to have a lot of children.

1138
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,893
I did?

1139
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:43,894
Mm-hmm.

1140
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,897
Gosh, I don't
remember that.

1141
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,899
Would you bring the
biscuits in, please?

1142
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:49,900
Sure.

1143
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,401
(men talking outside)

1144
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,904
What's going on
in your backyard?

1145
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,906
Oh, they're putting in
some azaleas.

1146
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,407
Oh.

1147
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,911
(phone rings)

1148
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,413
This is like running
a plantation.

1149
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,417
The, uh, divorce
was Laura's idea.

1150
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,919
One day, she
just announced

1151
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,921
that she wanted
me to move out.

1152
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,422
Of course,

1153
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,924
she kept our daughter.

1154
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:17,928
Laura's always had a better
understanding of Beatrice.

1155
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,930
It's only natural, I guess.

1156
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,932
She's... so much younger than I.

1157
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:22,933
Not like you.

1158
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,434
Excuse me?

1159
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,937
I, I mean
you were always

1160
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:28,939
so mature for your age,

1161
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:32,943
so involved with your
studies, so... serious.

1162
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,444
I always regret

1163
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:35,946
that I didn't finish
my education.

1164
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,949
Mmm. Do you remember
this new theory

1165
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,451
that I had of,
of why Robert E. Lee

1166
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,454
decided to cast his lot
with the South?

1167
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:45,455
Lee?

1168
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,456
Mmm.

1169
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,959
Maybe I should finish
that research.

1170
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,963
Th-there are other things
you can do, too, uh...

1171
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,966
Museums could be
particularly edifying.

1172
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,969
Gosh, I can't remember
the last time I was in a museum.

1173
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,971
Perhaps we could
go together.

1174
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,974
I'm going down to Washington
on Friday.

1175
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,976
Maybe you could join me.

1176
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,978
Wonderful museums there.

1177
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:08,979
Oh, I'd love to do that, Will.

1178
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:09,980
(phone rings)

1179
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,481
Friday, then.

1180
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,483
Good.

1181
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,986
Your phone sure does ring a lot.

1182
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,487
Can we go
in the other room?

1183
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,989
Rebecca...

1184
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,491
It's occurred to me

1185
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,493
that this was very providential.

1186
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,496
What?

1187
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:30,000
When you telephoned me
the first time,

1188
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,501
I had just hit rock bottom.

1189
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,005
I mean, it's
so incredibly
providential

1190
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,507
that you called me
when you did, Rebecca.

1191
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,009
In the old days,

1192
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,011
ice cream places
offered unlimited samples.

1193
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,014
Egg nog, pistachio,
rum raisin--

1194
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,015
any flavor.

1195
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,016
Well, hi.

1196
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,017
What are you doing here?

1197
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,018
We stopped
for ice cream,

1198
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,519
but Poppy was
so displeased

1199
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,520
with the service,

1200
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,022
he said he'd just as soon
have his dessert at home.

1201
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,024
Hi, I'm, I'm Will Allenby.

1202
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,026
Hi, I'm Zeb, Rebecca's
brother-in-law.

1203
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,028
This is my uncle,
Paul Davich.

1204
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,030
Sorry to barge
in like this.

1205
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,032
I thought
you were going to the movies.

1206
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,033
After that
smart aleck

1207
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,534
in the, in the
ice cream parlor,

1208
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:07,537
I, I didn't have the heart
for it.

1209
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,039
Wh-What's for dessert?

1210
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,040
Well, I remembered

1211
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,042
that Will
didn't care for sweets,

1212
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,043
so I didn't make
a dessert.

1213
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,544
POPPY:
Oh.

1214
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:15,545
Well, I'm going to take

1215
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,047
a look.

1216
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,048
So...

1217
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,050
you knew our Rebecca
in high school.

1218
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,551
"Our Rebecca"?

1219
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,558
Well, actually, um...
kindergarten.

1220
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,061
Beck! Are you home?

1221
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,062
(sighing)

1222
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,563
He-here.

1223
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:34,564
Where have you been?

1224
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,566
I've been phoning
and phoning you

1225
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,567
all evening.

1226
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,570
Uh, Will, this is
my stepdaughter, Nono,

1227
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,072
and this
is her stepson, Peter.

1228
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,573
This is Will Allenby,

1229
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,076
my old
high school sweetheart.

1230
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,577
Really? Nice
to meet you.

1231
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,579
Go ahead, Peter,
tell Rebecca

1232
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,081
what you wanted
to ask her.

1233
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,582
What, honey?

1234
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,585
Um... at
my school,

1235
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:59,589
they have this exhibit
of these projects.

1236
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,093
And they have us
invite our grandparents.

1237
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,594
It's on Friday.

1238
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,096
Is it this Friday?

1239
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,597
Uh-huh.

1240
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,101
And, I know you're
not really my grandma,

1241
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,603
but since my dad's parents
are dead,

1242
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,605
I was wondering if...

1243
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,607
I'd be honored to.

1244
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,608
Ice cream--

1245
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:20,110
who wants ice cream?

1246
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,113
Super Chunky Chango ice cream.

1247
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,115
(laughter)

1248
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,620
I'm so sorry about Friday,
but, you know, I just,

1249
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,622
I just couldn't
disappoint him.

1250
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,624
No, of course not.

1251
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,127
The museums will
always be there.

1252
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,129
Yeah.

1253
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,632
Well, you still have
quite a drive, right?

1254
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,634
Yes.

1255
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,649
I'll call you.

1256
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,653
I'll call you tomorrow.
(clanging)

1257
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,156
(chuckling)
Yikes.

1258
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,658
Thanks for supper.

1259
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,665
REBECCA:
Toast! To Abdul Abdulazim.

1260
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,167
His arrival
makes us beam.

1261
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:20,170
It's such a pleasure
to have a new boy.

1262
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,673
Let's hope he's as nice
as Lateesha and Joey.

1263
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,175
(screaming)

1264
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,676
Joey got stung
by a bee!

1265
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,178
Oh, my Lord.

1266
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,679
He's allergic!

1267
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,680
Well, how did a bee get in here?

1268
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,182
It'll be okay.

1269
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,183
Let's just go to the hospital.

1270
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,184
I'll get some ice.

1271
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,185
I've got Abdul.

1272
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,189
Dixon, you and Emmy
take Lateesha to the backyard.

1273
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,692
Wait, I'm coming.
I've got the ice.

1274
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:43,693
Beck?

1275
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,195
Oh, Poppy, please, not now.

1276
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,198
Beck, I... I don't feel so good.

1277
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,201
Here's a list
of all of his medicines.

1278
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,702
He's allergic
to, uh,

1279
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,705
to penicillin and tomatoes.

1280
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,707
Is this a heart attack?

1281
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,210
I didn't have my,
my 100th birthday party yet.

1282
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,712
You'll have your
party, Poppy,
I promise you.

1283
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:03,713
I'll call you.

1284
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,215
PARAMEDIC:
Watch your step.

1285
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,220
(monitor beeping)

1286
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,726
It's okay.

1287
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,729
It's going to be okay.
How are we doing?

1288
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,233
Well, he's not feeling so...

1289
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:27,237
Zeb... they're trying
to finish me off.

1290
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,738
Nope, they're
letting you go.

1291
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,240
Turns out
it was indigestion.

1292
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,741
(chuckling):
Oh.

1293
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,742
Indigestion?

1294
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,244
I spoke with the resident.

1295
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,747
He said you had three cupcakes
at the baby welcoming.

1296
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,249
Well, what if I did?

1297
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,751
I've eaten far more many a time.

1298
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,253
We should let them know
at home.

1299
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,254
Poppy...

1300
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,255
They must be
pretty worried.

1301
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,256
Yeah. Did Joey get his shot?

1302
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:47,757
He's already
back at the party,

1303
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,259
making up for lost time.

1304
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,760
I'll go call.

1305
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,763
Oh, God, I am so relieved
that it was only indigestion.

1306
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:56,266
Yeah, well,
I don't know

1307
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,767
what the world is coming to

1308
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,769
if a man can't eat
three measly cupcakes

1309
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,272
without folks
calling an ambulance.

1310
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,773
(laughter)

1311
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,780
REBECCA:
Oh, I forgot
the dessert.

1312
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,783
You do like dessert,
now, don't you, monsieur?

1313
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,285
Whoa.

1314
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,287
(laughing)

1315
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:19,289
Thank you.

1316
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,790
How's your father-in-law?

1317
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,791
My father-in-law?
Mm-hmm.

1318
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,792
Oh, you mean Poppy.

1319
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,294
Uh, he's not
my father-in-law.

1320
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,795
He's Joe's uncle.

1321
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,297
Want this one?

1322
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,265
And you still live with him,

1323
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,766
even though
you're barely related.

1324
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,268
Well, I sort of
inherited him.

1325
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,769
He came with the house.

1326
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,770
(chuckles)

1327
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,773
For a while
I resented

1328
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,775
having to take
care of him,

1329
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,728
but when I thought
he might die, I...

1330
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:45,732
I realized
how much he means to me.

1331
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:47,701
Don't mind
my asking, but...

1332
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,703
how come
after your husband died

1333
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,704
you never remarried?

1334
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,656
I don't know.

1335
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:56,159
I, I think what you look
for in a person changes.

1336
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,164
You know, when I was young,
I wanted somebody "other."

1337
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,667
The most wildly other person.

1338
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:10,173
Not... well, that's why
I was drawn to Joe, I guess.

1339
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,143
But now I just,
uh, think the idea

1340
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,144
of being with
somebody different

1341
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,148
would just...
be exhausting.

1342
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,650
Well, look at you and me.

1343
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,585
We're totally different,
Rebecca.

1344
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,088
We are?

1345
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:29,592
Oh, well it might seem so now,
but...

1346
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:33,596
well, I think of the old days,
the things that interested us...

1347
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:37,100
well, I think,
yeah, that was back...

1348
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,103
that was back
when we were grownups.

1349
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:45,608
'Course, you still are
a grownup, but me, I...

1350
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,110
I feel like I've been

1351
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,595
traveling
in reverse.

1352
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,555
(chuckling)

1353
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,027
WILL:
Robert E. Lee.

1354
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,529
Boy, things sure
have changed

1355
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,032
since we were
at MacAdam, huh?

1356
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,034
WILL:
Go.

1357
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,036
REBECCA:
Oh, wow!

1358
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,538
This was such a good idea,
Will.

1359
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,041
Well, you said you wanted to
continue on with your research.

1360
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,543
This might be interesting.

1361
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,544
Uh-huh.

1362
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,047
This one might be good.

1363
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,048
On special order.

1364
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,549
Oh, dear.

1365
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,550
No, no, it's all right.

1366
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,053
Hmm? Won't take long?

1367
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,054
Uh-uh.

1368
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,557
No problem.

1369
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,559
Okay. Come on.

1370
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,562
(beeping)

1371
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,067
We'll call you when it comes in.

1372
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,068
Great, thanks;
you're done.

1373
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,569
Let me grab these.
I'll take some of those.

1374
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,570
No, no, no; here we go.

1375
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,072
Oh, well.

1376
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,073
Chivalry is not dead.

1377
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,574
(chuckling)
Thank you.

1378
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,584
(phone rings)

1379
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,585
Hello.

1380
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,087
ZEB:
Hey, Beck.

1381
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,088
Oh, hi, Zeb.

1382
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,090
What you doing?

1383
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,093
Ooh, I'm reading
a fascinating book.

1384
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,095
Me, too.

1385
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,097
The Harmful Effects
of Nightlights on Children.

1386
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,598
Nightlights?

1387
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,600
Children who've been raised
with nightlights

1388
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,601
end up with vision problems.

1389
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,603
Their eyes
don't get enough rest.

1390
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,106
They should read this book--
that'd put them to sleep.

1391
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,607
Well, from now on,

1392
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:28,111
I am going to read
two books a week-- serious ones.

1393
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,612
And I am going to join a gym,

1394
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,614
'cause I'm going
to get into shape.

1395
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,116
You're fine the way you are.

1396
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,617
I am not.

1397
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,618
I'm a slug.

1398
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,620
You of all people-- a doctor.

1399
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,124
No, from now on,
I am concentrating on me.

1400
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,126
You're right.

1401
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,127
Good night.

1402
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,128
Good night.

1403
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,637
(sighs)

1404
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,643
Hi, nice to meet you.

1405
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,148
How's that?

1406
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,649
Good.
Oh, that's great.

1407
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,152
(devices buzzing and clicking)

1408
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,160
Oh, where's your project?

1409
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,661
It's over here.

1410
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,668
REBECCA:
This is yours?

1411
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,170
PETER:
Uh-huh.

1412
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,674
Oh, my gosh.

1413
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,676
(laughing)

1414
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,180
(gasping and chuckling)

1415
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,682
This is wonderful!

1416
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,686
I don't know
how you did this.

1417
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,687
What do...

1418
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,189
what do
your teachers say?

1419
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,191
I think they kind
of liked it.

1420
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,692
Oh, I bet they do.

1421
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,693
Is there a motor?

1422
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,195
(chuckling):
That's a secret.

1423
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,196
Oh.

1424
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,697
Oh, then don't tell me.

1425
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,199
Don't tell me.

1426
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,201
I will just view this
as a miracle.

1427
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,203
You want to see
the other projects?

1428
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,704
No. No, I...

1429
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,207
I just want to stay here
and admire this one.

1430
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,714
Oh, no, no.

1431
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,716
That boy is brilliant.

1432
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,722
Yes. Everybody keeps telling me
how bright he is.

1433
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,225
I just...
I wish he could drive.

1434
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,227
Honey, did you
see his project?

1435
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,730
I don't know if it was
music or art or science,

1436
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,732
but it is astounding.

1437
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,234
I was the one
who had to ferry him

1438
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,236
to the back of beyond
for supplies.

1439
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,238
Barry was away
attending a conference,

1440
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,239
wouldn't you know?

1441
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,241
I know it's hard.

1442
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,244
But I so wish
that you could enjoy this boy,

1443
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,748
because he is going
to be grown and gone in a flash.

1444
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,750
Easy for you to say.

1445
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,252
You don't have
the slightest idea

1446
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,754
what it's like being saddled
with somebody else's kid

1447
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,756
when you're still
practically on your honeymoon.

1448
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,258
GIRL:
No, no, no, no!

1449
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:59,262
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

1450
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,271
I thought maybe you'd like

1451
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,772
to meet my daughter.

1452
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:10,773
Oh, Will, I would love

1453
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,275
to meet your daughter.

1454
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,278
Oh, mm. Something I can bring?

1455
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,779
No, just yourself.

1456
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,281
What shall I wear?

1457
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,783
Anything...

1458
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:25,288
or-or maybe...
no... just anything.

1459
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,790
No, Will, you can tell me.

1460
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,292
I mean, is there
something special

1461
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,793
you want me to wear or not wear?

1462
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,297
Well, I...
I-I-I don't know, um...

1463
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,798
(clears throat)

1464
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:41,304
Maybe... something
not too... hippie.

1465
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,806
Hippie?

1466
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,808
Well, it's-it's just
that some of your clothes

1467
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,311
tend to be a bit... exotic.

1468
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,313
Oh.

1469
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,816
And-and I want Beatrice to focus
on you more as a person.

1470
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,319
Oh, oh, oh, I see. Okay.

1471
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,845
(doorbell rings)

1472
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,349
Ta-da.

1473
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,850
Oh. Well, you
look great.

1474
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,352
Thank you.

1475
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,853
Hi. Come on
in, come in.

1476
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,855
My, this is wonderful.
Come in here.

1477
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,357
Here, ha-have a seat.

1478
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,858
All right. Thank you.

1479
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,361
I keep feeling I should get
a cleaning service in.

1480
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,364
Oh. Uh, Beatrice
isn't here yet, huh?

1481
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,865
No, but I expect her.

1482
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,868
Aw...

1483
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,370
What?

1484
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,871
Everything's going
to be just fine.

1485
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,873
You don't know Beatrice.

1486
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,875
We are going to
have such fun.

1487
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:58,381
I'm serving this nutritious,
all-grain dish.

1488
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,883
She's a vegetarian.

1489
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,885
(doorbell rings)
Oh, boy.

1490
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,387
Excuse me.

1491
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,389
I used chicken stock,
but don't say a word.

1492
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,891
Oh. My lips are sealed.

1493
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,896
Hi, Beatrice.

1494
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,898
Hello, Beatrice.

1495
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,411
So, you told me to
come here at 6:00.

1496
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,412
Here I am.

1497
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,414
Well, thank you, Bea.

1498
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,915
I'm very glad you came.

1499
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,917
Are we eating
supper or not?

1500
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,421
Oh, oh, don't you want
to sit around a while

1501
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,923
and talk? I...
Talk? About what?

1502
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,426
And who is this lady, anyhow?

1503
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,928
Oh. I'm, um... I'm, um,
a very old, old friend

1504
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:46,929
of your father's.

1505
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,431
We grew up together.

1506
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,933
Oh, so I guess next,
you're going to tell me

1507
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,436
that you guys have fallen
madly in love or something.

1508
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,938
Beatrice...
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

1509
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,940
Well, I guess we've
fallen in fond,

1510
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,443
but really, I came here
to meet you tonight.

1511
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,445
Your father's told me
so much about you.

1512
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,947
Yeah? Well, I'm not here
'cause I want to be.

1513
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:05,948
I'm here because
he promised me

1514
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,451
my own cell
phone if I came.

1515
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,952
Oh.

1516
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,956
Okay, we've met.
Can I go now?

1517
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,958
You-you-you haven't eaten.

1518
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,461
All right, if you insist,
let's eat.

1519
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,963
Oh.

1520
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,965
(clears throat)

1521
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,469
This is a complete,
in one dish, whole grain meal.

1522
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,970
Oh.
Entirely vegetarian.

1523
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,973
Actually, I eat meat now.

1524
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,975
You do?
Well, we can all stand

1525
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,479
to eat some grain
from time to time.

1526
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,981
Beatrice, pass me
your plate.

1527
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,485
I'm afraid
I'm not much of a chef.

1528
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,988
Oh, I think you were wonderful
to make the effort.

1529
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,490
Thanks.

1530
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,997
(groans)

1531
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,002
(scoffs)

1532
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,506
So... do many men
have you to supper, Rebecca?

1533
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,009
Oh. Well, I don't... No.

1534
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,012
'Cause, actually, you seem
pretty normal on the surface.

1535
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,514
I'm just wondering
if you realize

1536
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,516
what kind of guy
you're eating with, here.

1537
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,518
Uh, he's a pretty nice guy.

1538
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,021
The guy who
kidnapped our dog

1539
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,023
when Mom asked
him for a divorce.

1540
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,528
Your dog?

1541
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,530
Our little dog, Flopsie.

1542
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,533
I did not kidnap
Flopsie Doodle.

1543
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:31,534
I borrowed her.

1544
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,035
He stole her

1545
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,037
while we were out,
and we came home,

1546
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,539
and we called, "Flopsie."

1547
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,540
No Flopsie.

1548
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,041
So my mom phoned my dad.

1549
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,543
We knew it was him.

1550
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,545
And she said that she
was calling the police.

1551
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,546
Do you know what he did?

1552
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,548
He lied, and he said,

1553
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,551
oh, he had no idea what
she was talking about.

1554
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:52,555
Then he opened up his door
and let Flopsie run out

1555
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,557
all by herself,
when everybody knows

1556
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,059
what a terrible sense
of direction she has.

1557
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,061
It's lucky she wasn't killed.

1558
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,064
I was feeling sad, okay?

1559
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,566
I was having
a difficult time.

1560
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:07,069
Like it wasn't difficult
for Mom and me?

1561
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:11,073
I went looking for her
in the rainstorm.

1562
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,075
I was out half the night,

1563
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,078
and when I found her,
all covered with mud,

1564
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,080
I-I put her
in my brand-new car,

1565
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,583
and I brought
her home.

1566
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,086
How many times
can I apologize?

1567
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:28,591
Well, just so you know,
you're boyfriend's a total perv.

1568
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,596
You're getting me

1569
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,098
a cell phone tomorrow.

1570
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,605
(door opens)

1571
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,607
(door slams)

1572
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,609
Well, I guess this
wasn't very successful.

1573
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,611
Oh, well, it's...
You know what?

1574
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,113
Now that I've met your family,
I want you to meet mine.

1575
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,615
I mean, I already...

1576
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,116
Well, three or four
you bumped into,

1577
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,118
but I... but I mean
a proper dinner party

1578
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,120
with everybody there.
Okay?

1579
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,622
That'd be great.
Good.

1580
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,623
Oh...

1581
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,126
Gracious.

1582
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,128
(chuckles)

1583
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,130
Well, hey, thank you.

1584
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,132
Thanks for dinner.
Thanks very much.

1585
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,635
If I'd known that Beatrice
was back eating meat,

1586
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,637
I would have served my chili.

1587
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,139
Hmm. Mm-hmm.
All right. Bye-bye.

1588
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,141
Bye.

1589
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,644
Hmm.

1590
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,648
(crickets chirping)

1591
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,651
ZEB:
He kidnapped their dog?

1592
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,652
REBECCA:
Oh, yeah.

1593
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,153
Oh, boy. Well, in a way,

1594
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,156
I think he's still, um,
in mourning for his marriage.

1595
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,659
You know, he's been going
through a really difficult time.

1596
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,663
He's kind of an odd guy,
and I just thought a party

1597
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,164
where he could meet
all of you would...

1598
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,168
Rebecca, I've met Will
on a couple of occasions.

1599
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,671
Yeah, I know, but I-I'd like him
to meet everybody,

1600
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:52,174
all together, you know--
a more formal atmosphere.

1601
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,175
Formal?

1602
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,677
Yeah, just not some typical

1603
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,679
Davich free-for-all potluck

1604
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,181
where Will could be overwhelmed,

1605
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,184
but something... sedate
and organized.

1606
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,187
You know, everybody arriving
at a pre-arranged time,

1607
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:09,191
talking about civilized topics,
you know?

1608
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,193
Why can't we bring children?

1609
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,195
It's a grown-up affair.

1610
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,197
I want you to meet
the man in my life.

1611
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,199
You have a man in your life?

1612
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,201
You never told me that.

1613
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,204
Oh, you know Will has been
coming around now and then.

1614
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,707
I thought he was just a friend.

1615
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,708
(baby cooing)

1616
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,711
Why are you springing this
on me now?

1617
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,213
I am not springing
anything on you.

1618
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,215
This is not about you.

1619
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,217
Saturday night?
You're never free on Saturdays.

1620
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,719
Is the Open Arms going under?

1621
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,220
No more than usual.

1622
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,222
Well, haven't I already met
this person?

1623
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,224
Yes, but-but I
want this to be

1624
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,226
a more official
introduction

1625
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,728
to the family
as a whole.

1626
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,230
Okay, look, whatever.
I'm running late, okay?

1627
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,232
Okay. Bye.

1628
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,735
(phone rings)

1629
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,237
(sighs)

1630
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,739
Open Arms.

1631
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,741
How come you invited Min Foo
to dinner and not me?

1632
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,242
Patch, I was just going to...

1633
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,243
Is this because
she's your real daughter?

1634
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,745
I hate you.

1635
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,247
You're not my mother.

1636
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,249
(gasps)

1637
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,250
Patch, for heaven's sakes,

1638
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,753
I'm inviting all of you.

1639
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,258
Oh, Beck, this
is so exciting.

1640
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,259
A man in your life.

1641
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,261
I am making
something fabulous.

1642
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,763
What is that
you're wearing?

1643
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,264
Oh, just something
different

1644
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,766
than my usual
hippie dippie

1645
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,268
color crazy
thing, you know?

1646
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,770
Call it flight attendant
casual.

1647
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,271
(laughs)
(doorbell rings)

1648
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:33,275
Well, fasten your seat
belts, me merry crew.

1649
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,784
Hi, Will.

1650
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,787
Am I late
or early or... okay?

1651
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,289
Oh, you're... you're
right on time. Come on.

1652
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,290
Okay.
Yeah.

1653
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,292
WILL:
Thanks.

1654
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,302
I trust you have nothing
against hearts of palm.

1655
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,804
That what that is?

1656
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,273
I thought it'd
be a nice...

1657
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:05,724
symbolic touch.

1658
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,729
Hearts, romance, you know?

1659
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,232
Hmm. Palm trees

1660
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,234
are cut up for that?

1661
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,735
(grunts)

1662
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,686
Broccoli plants are cut up.

1663
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,188
Asparagus shoots are cut up.

1664
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,690
Don't tell me you're one
of those food avoiders.

1665
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:26,162
No, no, no, I'm...
not that much into experiment.

1666
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,665
Sea urchins are an experiment.

1667
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,668
Hearts of palm is just a salad.

1668
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,103
So, you and Rebecca
have-have known each other

1669
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,104
since you were kids?

1670
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,605
50 years.

1671
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:39,608
Oh! Can I really have
been alive that long?

1672
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,610
And now you're reunited.
That's, uh...

1673
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,113
Must be complicated, though,
living in separate towns.

1674
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:47,049
WILL:
Oh, that's exactly it.

1675
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,051
My odometer's taken a huge leap,

1676
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:52,054
and my engine's developed
a cough, uh...

1677
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,557
Oh, well, you-you should give
J.J. a call.

1678
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,058
WILL:
J.J.?

1679
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:58,060
Yeah, J.J. does a lot of,
uh, odd jobs around here,

1680
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,062
but, oh, he is
a gifted mechanic.

1681
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:03,566
He's the only one
that can coax my Chevy along.

1682
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:04,567
J.J.'s great.

1683
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,070
Yeah. Oh, you know,
he is forever bragging

1684
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,072
about his wife, Tanya.

1685
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,575
Look, see, um, they had, uh,
themselves made up

1686
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,577
to look like Bonnie and Clyde,

1687
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,579
and then they had
their picture taken.

1688
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,581
(Rebecca laughs)

1689
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,082
That's your mechanic?

1690
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,084
Mm. Well,
lately, though,

1691
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,087
Tanya's had to increase
her medication.

1692
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,589
Poor thing, you know,

1693
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:32,044
she's just given to these sort
of demented delusions, and, uh,

1694
01:10:32,044 --> 01:10:33,979
oh, gosh, one day,
she was walking

1695
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,482
across somebody's front porch;
she was wildly

1696
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,468
flinging a-a souvenir
Japanese sword.

1697
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,971
Ay-yi-yi. And, uh...

1698
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:46,442
J.J. said that that's not
the real true Tanya.

1699
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:50,446
He just still thinks
that his wife is... amazing.

1700
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,450
That's the man
that repairs your cars.

1701
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,951
(door opening)

1702
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,386
Oh.

1703
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,387
Hello. We're in here.

1704
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,888
MIN FOO:
I told you,
she's not gonna be...

1705
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,373
Hi.
I know you said
adults only...

1706
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:02,875
Hi.
but I'm still
breast-feeding.

1707
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:03,876
What do you expect?

1708
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:05,377
It's all right.
It's all right.

1709
01:11:05,377 --> 01:11:06,829
Hi.
Hey.

1710
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:07,830
Don't put him there.

1711
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,798
Someone's gonna
step on him.

1712
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,750
This man is hopeless.

1713
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,685
At 7:00 in
the morning,

1714
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,186
he's asking me to
brew him coffee.

1715
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,689
I only asked if coffee
had been made, Min Foo.

1716
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,190
You could have
seen for yourself

1717
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,191
that it wasn't made.

1718
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,693
Shh. It's all right,
it's all right.

1719
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,695
What is that
you're wearing?

1720
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:23,696
PATCH:
It's us.

1721
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:24,697
Hi.

1722
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,198
Sorry we're late.

1723
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,200
What is that you're wearing?

1724
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,201
It is my brand-new suit

1725
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,703
that I bought on Thursday,
and I like it,

1726
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,204
so don't
say a word.

1727
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,205
Ah, everyone,

1728
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,708
I would like
you to meet
Will Allenby,

1729
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,209
the person

1730
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,695
I invited you here to meet.

1731
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:44,166
(silence)

1732
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,169
(silverware clattering)

1733
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,671
(baby cooing)

1734
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,673
(all talking quietly)

1735
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,680
Min Foo, do that
in the other room.

1736
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,682
MIN FOO:
I'm decently
covered.

1737
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:00,683
I'm not sitting
here naked.

1738
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:01,684
We have company.

1739
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,685
What must he think?

1740
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,636
I'm sure you've
seen a woman

1741
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:06,138
nursing a
baby before.

1742
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:08,073
Well, yes.

1743
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,575
I mean, of course.

1744
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,076
(baby fussing)

1745
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,579
Though, not
at a dinner table, but...

1746
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,580
(sighs)

1747
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,584
(baby crying)

1748
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,586
Oh, boy.

1749
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:21,587
Patch, go
after her.

1750
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:22,087
I will not.

1751
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,589
MIN FOO:
Hakim!

1752
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,590
I shall go.

1753
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,095
A toast.

1754
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,597
Oh, yes, a toast.
Yeah.

1755
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,098
POPPY:
A toast.
Good.

1756
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,100
POPPY:
I propose a toast to...

1757
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,102
a toast to me and my birthday.

1758
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,604
(laughter)
Oh, Poppy.

1759
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,606
It is not your birthday.

1760
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,107
POPPY:
Oh.

1761
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,609
(whispering):
This is a toast

1762
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,610
to Will, welcome.

1763
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,612
Oh, yeah, a toast to Will.

1764
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,614
To-To welcome Will.

1765
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,615
ALL:
To Will.

1766
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:51,116
POPPY:
Here's to Will.

1767
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:52,117
Here, here.

1768
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:56,622
(all talking at once)

1769
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,123
WILL:
Thank you.

1770
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:00,125
Ah.

1771
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:05,130
Um... maybe a toast
to... Rebecca.

1772
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,131
Oh.

1773
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,136
To Rebecca for being so lovely,

1774
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:14,640
so gracious,

1775
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,142
and cheering up my life.

1776
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,644
Thank you.

1777
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,645
To Becky!

1778
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,647
Rebecca.
ZEB:
Can't imagine where

1779
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,649
we'd all be if
Rebecca hadn't
shown up.

1780
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,651
She turned out
to be awfully
good for business.

1781
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,152
(laughs):
Not at first.

1782
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,154
I'm sure that Zeb remembers
the first time

1783
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,656
I helped out at a party.

1784
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:33,158
(laughs):
Oh, God.

1785
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:36,662
I let fly a champagne cork...

1786
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,164
(laughter)

1787
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,166
...straight
into a woman's bosom.

1788
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,169
(laughter)

1789
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:45,671
ZEB:
Right.

1790
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,173
Rebecca crumples to the floor
in mortification,

1791
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,175
like she's the one who got hit,
and this women just

1792
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,177
keeps right on talking,
completely unaware.

1793
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,179
Falsies was my

1794
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,181
considered opinion.

1795
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,182
(laughter)

1796
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:59,685
Then she bends down
and she says,

1797
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,186
"Are you all right, dear?"

1798
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,188
And then I just popped right up,
and I...

1799
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,190
(laughs):
I poured the
champagne...

1800
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,191
(sighs)

1801
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:07,693
...like nothing
happened.

1802
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,195
(laughs)

1803
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,196
Hmm.

1804
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,698
(low chatter)

1805
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,199
(clears throat)

1806
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,702
(chatter,
silverware clattering)

1807
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,705
HAKIM:
? Oh Abdul, boy ?

1808
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,206
? The pipes,
the pipes are calling ?

1809
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,708
Here.

1810
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,711
? From glen to glen ?

1811
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:27,713
Oh.

1812
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,716
? And down the mountainside... ?

1813
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:31,717
Sweet.

1814
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,218
I didn't know he was Irish.

1815
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,221
I can't believe
that she brought
the baby here.

1816
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:41,727
(chatter, soft laughter,
singing continues)

1817
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,730
? Oh, Abdul, boy ?

1818
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:51,737
? Oh, Abdul, boy,
I love you so. ?

1819
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,238
WOMAN:
I'll call you tomorrow.

1820
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,740
Nice to see
you again, Will.

1821
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,241
REBECCA:
I loved that.
Thank you, bye, bye.

1822
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,743
We'll see
you again.
Thanks, Beck.

1823
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,244
Thank you, Rebecca.
Bye, bye. All right.

1824
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,746
It was nice to
meet you, Will.
Bye, Will.

1825
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:03,749
Thanks. Bye.

1826
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,751
Yeah. Frankly, I'm
having a hard time

1827
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,252
sorting them all out.

1828
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,253
(laughs)

1829
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:10,255
I mean, why-why
is that one,

1830
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:14,259
uh, stepdaughter,
uh, Chinese?

1831
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,262
And... and the
fella, uh, Troy--

1832
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:18,764
is he Biddy's
husband?

1833
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,766
No, no. Fir-First of all,

1834
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,769
Min Foo is my daughter,
not my stepdaughter.

1835
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,771
I named her Minerva.

1836
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,273
But Joe took one look
at her paintbrush hair

1837
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,276
and her sleepy eyes--
no wider than slits-- and...

1838
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,279
Hey there,
little Min Foo.

1839
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,781
REBECCA:
As for Troy,

1840
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,783
he's the brother
of Biddy's fianc?, Roland,

1841
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,284
who died suddenly.

1842
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,285
Troy is gay.

1843
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,787
REBECCA:
And then,

1844
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,790
after Roland died,
Biddy discovered

1845
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,292
she was pregnant with Dixon,

1846
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:51,296
so Troy moved back in
and helped raise him.

1847
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,800
And he's been with them
every step of the way.

1848
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,804
So, Dixon was conceived,
uh, before...

1849
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,806
I'll get the family album.

1850
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,307
Oh, but Poppy,
your milk's almost ready.

1851
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:03,809
And anyway, Will has already

1852
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,311
more or lessseen
the family album.

1853
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,313
I'll get the family album.

1854
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,315
REBECCA:
Oh, boy.

1855
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,317
Now you're in for it.

1856
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,319
So,

1857
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,821
how'd you like my family?

1858
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,822
Well, um...

1859
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:17,823
(clears throat)

1860
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,825
they're... they're
ver-very interesting.

1861
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,326
Yeah, well.

1862
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,328
Ah, you didn't see Min Foo
at her best.

1863
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,832
I'm afraid
she's beginning an old pattern.

1864
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,334
Uh, have a baby,
ditch the husband.

1865
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,837
Oh, they all are
pretty outspoken...

1866
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,839
It's-It's kind
of like those nature programs,

1867
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,341
you know, where the female
does away with the male

1868
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:39,344
after he donates his sperm?

1869
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,346
Pardon?

1870
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,348
So many parties.

1871
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,350
POPPY:
Yeah. Isn't
that the truth.

1872
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,352
I mean, everywhere I look.

1873
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,854
Well.

1874
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:52,357
On the refrigerator,
in this album.

1875
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,359
Everybody's celebrating.

1876
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:57,863
I mean, we just drank a toast
in there.

1877
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,865
And now you've brought me
in here,

1878
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,367
and you've got me looking
at photos of toasts.

1879
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,870
Years of toasts.

1880
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,872
Oh, they're
photographs.

1881
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,373
I mean, you don't
usually take pictures

1882
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:13,378
of people reading a
book or playing chess.

1883
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,379
Chess?

1884
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,381
(laughs):
We-We don't play chess.

1885
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,382
WILL:
Well, I
mean you...

1886
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:20,385
You do have an unusual amount
of parties,

1887
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:21,803
you'll have to admit.

1888
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:24,306
Every time we try
to get together, we have

1889
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:28,310
to work
around your social events.

1890
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,312
Social events.

1891
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:50,832
WILL:
Well, I mean, I understand
you're a social type.

1892
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:54,336
But consorting
with your mechanic?

1893
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,839
Sharing marital secrets
with a stranger?

1894
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,808
J.J.'s not a stranger.

1895
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,810
Well, from what
you've told me,

1896
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,796
his attitude about his wife
shows a total lack

1897
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:05,797
of responsibility.

1898
01:18:05,797 --> 01:18:06,798
Piffle.

1899
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:09,301
Oh. Oh.

1900
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:10,302
Here's my Joycie.

1901
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:11,303
(chuckles)

1902
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:12,304
She was a cutie

1903
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:13,805
all right. Ooh.

1904
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:15,307
Yeah.

1905
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,311
I better haul myself off to bed.

1906
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:21,313
Oh, yeah.

1907
01:18:21,313 --> 01:18:23,815
Yeah, I-I
think I'm, uh...

1908
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:26,818
I'm gonna go
to bed, too.

1909
01:18:26,818 --> 01:18:29,821
Oh. All right.

1910
01:18:31,823 --> 01:18:33,825
Oh.

1911
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:36,328
Don't forget
my birthday party.

1912
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:37,829
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

1913
01:18:37,829 --> 01:18:39,331
Oh, yeah.

1914
01:18:39,331 --> 01:18:41,333
When is his birthday?

1915
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,335
It's in December.

1916
01:18:43,335 --> 01:18:45,837
What date in December?

1917
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:46,838
I don't think

1918
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:49,341
we'll be seeing
each other in
December, Will.

1919
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,343
What-What...
What do you mean?

1920
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:52,344
Or before
that, either.

1921
01:18:54,346 --> 01:18:56,348
Was it something that I did?

1922
01:18:56,348 --> 01:18:59,351
You didn't do anything, Will.

1923
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:01,353
Was it your family? Didn't...

1924
01:19:01,353 --> 01:19:03,355
I mean, didn't they like me?

1925
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:04,856
I'm sure they liked you.

1926
01:19:05,357 --> 01:19:07,359
Zeb?

1927
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:08,360
Zeb?

1928
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,861
Well, obviously,

1929
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:11,363
he's my competition,
although, I...

1930
01:19:11,363 --> 01:19:12,864
No, the fact
of the matter is, this...

1931
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:13,865
It just won't work, Will.

1932
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:14,866
It won't.

1933
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:21,373
I'm sorry to do this to you.

1934
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,377
Again.

1935
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:47,399
(sighs)

1936
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:48,900
Good-bye, Will.

1937
01:19:54,906 --> 01:19:56,908
Good-bye, Will.

1938
01:20:07,919 --> 01:20:09,921
Well...

1939
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:14,426
all right then.

1940
01:20:16,928 --> 01:20:19,431
Good-bye, Rebecca.

1941
01:20:43,455 --> 01:20:45,457
WOMAN:
Practically as old
as Robert E. Lee himself.

1942
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,460
Sorry it took so long
to come in.

1943
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,963
Oh... no, that's-that's, uh...
that's all right.

1944
01:20:51,963 --> 01:20:53,465
Thank you.

1945
01:20:54,966 --> 01:20:57,969
No, really, really,
my life is finished.

1946
01:20:57,969 --> 01:21:00,972
It finished
when the girls got grown...

1947
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:03,475
so here I am, just, you know,
hanging around,

1948
01:21:03,475 --> 01:21:07,362
marking time, waiting
for things to wind down.

1949
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,365
ZEB:
Rebecca, are you all right?

1950
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,367
Well, yeah. Define "all right."

1951
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,370
Where's Will in all this?

1952
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,371
Gone.

1953
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,873
You ditched him?

1954
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,875
(chuckles):
Yep, but that's not the problem.

1955
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,877
The problem is just I've...

1956
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:25,380
I've outlived myself.

1957
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:31,386
Well... remember
what George Eliot said.

1958
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,889
What did George Eliot say?

1959
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,391
It's never too late
to do what you want to do.

1960
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,395
Well, you know, that's just...

1961
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,398
that is just plain wrong.

1962
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:46,401
I mean, what if I wanted to--
I don't know--

1963
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,905
what if I wanted
to get pregnant?

1964
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,908
I mean, Zeb,
that's just ridiculous.

1965
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,412
(dial tone buzzes)

1966
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,918
(phone rings)

1967
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,419
Sorry.

1968
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,922
I just remembered; it wasn't
do what you want to do,

1969
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,925
it's be what you want to be,
I think.

1970
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,928
I guess I'm just so tired.

1971
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,429
I'm not even sure
it's George Eliot.

1972
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,932
Thanks for trying, Zeb.

1973
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,433
Night.

1974
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,936
Good night.

1975
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,439
(water running)

1976
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,447
(sighs)

1977
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,449
There you are, Joe.

1978
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,953
Ready for another
glorious day,

1979
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:42,457
helping other people
celebrate life.

1980
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,485
(birds chirping)

1981
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,013
Happy birthday, Poppy.

1982
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,514
Oh, thank you, Beck.

1983
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,016
(chuckles)

1984
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,517
Ooh, I got it, I got it.

1985
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,519
Ooh. Do you know that
100 years ago today,

1986
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,021
you were just the
tiniest bundle

1987
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,522
nestled in your cradle?

1988
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,025
I don't even know who
was president then.

1989
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,026
Oh, beats me.

1990
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,028
(chuckles)

1991
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,529
No cars, probably
no phones.

1992
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,531
Mm.

1993
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,034
I wonder from time to time

1994
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:03,038
if the years Joycie didn't get
to use in her life

1995
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,040
got added onto mine.

1996
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,542
Oh, oh, she
would've been glad

1997
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,544
to see you enjoy it.

1998
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:13,548
Ah... Joycie... Joyce was
a naturally happy person,

1999
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,550
not like us Daviches.

2000
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:20,055
Some people just have
a harder time being happy.

2001
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,057
Oh, boy. The night
that I met Joe,

2002
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,059
oh, he... he was laughin',

2003
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,061
and then, when I saw him
a few days later,

2004
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,564
through the
library window...

2005
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,066
oh, I saw that life in his eyes,

2006
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:35,070
and I knew right at that moment
that I wanted to marry him.

2007
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,572
You know, I think
you might be right, though,

2008
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,074
about the Daviches,
because deep down,

2009
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:43,578
I-I-I'm not sure
he was really happy.

2010
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:48,583
He never thought of party-giving
as his true life.

2011
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,586
Face it, Beck,
there is no true life.

2012
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:55,090
Your true life is the one you
end up with, whatever it may be.

2013
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:00,095
You just do the best
with what you've got.

2014
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,602
This isn't my party,
is it?

2015
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,105
(laughing):
Oh, no...

2016
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,106
No, no, Poppy.

2017
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,108
Your party is going to be

2018
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:17,612
everything you dreamed
it would be.

2019
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:20,615
(band playing jazzy music)

2020
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:24,619
Oh, Mother, come here.
I want you to meet Tanya.

2021
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,121
Oh, no, thank you.

2022
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,122
J.J.J.
How do you do?

2023
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,623
And J.J. Barrow.
Hi.

2024
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,625
How do you do?
J.J.'s our,
uh, handyman.

2025
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,128
Oh. Are you here
as guests?

2026
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,129
Yes.
Yes, we are.

2027
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,631
Hey, Poppy,
how you doing?
Oh.

2028
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,134
(kids laughing)

2029
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,635
Happy birthday, Poppy.

2030
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,637
Birthday, Poppy.
Birthday, Poppy.

2031
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,639
Whoa, for me?

2032
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,141
(laughs):
Oh.

2033
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:49,644
Whoa, how
'bout that?

2034
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:52,647
President Theodore
Roosevelt.

2035
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,150
He was president
the year you were born.

2036
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,651
That's beautiful. Look.

2037
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,153
President Theodore Roosevelt.

2038
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,654
He was a great president.

2039
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:01,656
Are you really 100?

2040
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,660
Yes, but don't tell
anybody, huh?

2041
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,162
"Pick up dry cleaning,

2042
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,664
"make dental appointment
for Peter,

2043
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,666
"find someone
to clean the gutters,

2044
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,669
buy my bro
a birthday gift."

2045
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,172
These are the things I was
supposed to do last week.

2046
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,174
So?

2047
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,176
Beck, when you and Dad
got married, did you...?

2048
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,678
And-and-and don't take this
the wrong way,

2049
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:26,181
but did you ever wonder
if he'd married you

2050
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,183
just so that he would have help
with us kids?

2051
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,684
I mean, I...

2052
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:33,188
I am trying
not to think that of Barry,

2053
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,689
but I mean, these lists.

2054
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,191
Oh, what are you saying,

2055
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,193
that you don't think
that Barry loves you?

2056
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:43,198
He says he does, but, I mean,
the PTA meetings, the carpool...

2057
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,201
It's like... I'm so useful.

2058
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,703
Well, don't you think
that all of us,

2059
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,705
I mean, love people,

2060
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,208
you know, partly
because of their usefulness?

2061
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,211
Beck, love has nothing
to do with it.

2062
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,714
There's no use.
Hakim is hopeless.

2063
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:06,221
Thanks. I can always rely on
my family for emotional support.

2064
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,723
Oh, Min Foo...

2065
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:12,227
please, could you please
just once try to resist

2066
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:13,728
dumping a husband

2067
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,230
once you've had
his baby?

2068
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,232
I gave you the name
of Patch's marriage counselor.

2069
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,234
Patch, you're going to
a marriage counselor?

2070
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,736
Thanks a lot, Biddy.

2071
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:27,742
Why does everybody
in this family seem so unhappy?

2072
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,746
Thank goodness
for you and Troy.

2073
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,249
Troy is gay,
but we still argue

2074
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,751
just like every
other couple, okay?

2075
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:42,257
How reassuring to hear that.

2076
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:46,261
Hey, everybody,

2077
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,263
Hakim took all of Poppy's
homemade movies

2078
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,764
and turned them
into a tape.

2079
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:50,765
They only go up
to 1971, but...

2080
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,767
Shh.

2081
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,770
"Celebrating Paul Davich."

2082
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,273
(laughing)

2083
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,276
ZEB:
Ah, your famous
hamburgers, Poppy.

2084
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,779
God, I was always good
with my barbecue.

2085
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,781
Hey, there's my Joycie.

2086
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:07,782
(laughs)

2087
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,284
ZEB:
She looks great.

2088
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,785
POPPY:
She's my girl.

2089
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,287
She looks happy.

2090
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,289
Oh, man.

2091
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,291
Oh, I loved that dog.
That was Molly.

2092
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:19,794
POPPY:
Oh, that old train set.

2093
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,296
Oh, there's Uncle Zeb.

2094
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,798
POPPY:
I gave him that train.

2095
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,800
ZEB:
And there's Joe.

2096
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,801
Dad...

2097
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,804
Yeah, he looks good.

2098
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,806
GIRL:
Real bright lights.

2099
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,807
Uh-huh.

2100
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:33,808
(kids laughing)

2101
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:36,811
ZEB:
Oh, that's a
sweet shot.

2102
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,314
Look at that.

2103
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,315
(scoffs)

2104
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,317
ZEB:
Now, that's dancing.

2105
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,319
I should've
been arrested.

2106
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,820
That's some
nice moves.

2107
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,323
Our Easter egg hunt.

2108
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:49,824
Oh, there's me.

2109
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,326
I remember
that dress.

2110
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,328
Well, we all wore it.

2111
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,330
(laughter)

2112
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,331
Would you look at us?

2113
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,833
GIRL:
That looks like fun.

2114
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,835
POPPY:
Ooh, what a...

2115
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,837
what a bath she's getting.

2116
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,839
(all laughing)

2117
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:07,842
Weren't we the
perfect family?

2118
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,345
GIRL:
Where are you, Mommy?

2119
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:12,347
I wasn't born yet.

2120
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,848
And here you are,
Min Foo.

2121
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,351
MIN FOO:
Oh, there I am.

2122
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,852
There you are, Mommy.

2123
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:19,354
ZEB:
Yahoo, Min Foo.

2124
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,356
MIN FOO:
Dad didn't have a chance.

2125
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,857
Four girls.

2126
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,360
(laughing)

2127
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,361
Look at him.
He was so handsome.

2128
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:29,864
Wow.
POPPY:
Oh, that's a good movie.

2129
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,866
It was beautiful, yeah!

2130
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:33,368
MIN FOO:
Good job, Hakim.

2131
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:38,373
All right, cake
is in the dining room.

2132
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,874
Yay.

2133
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,627
MIN FOO:
Yeah, more
champagne.

2134
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,379
%% For he's a jolly good fellow %%

2135
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:47,382
%% For he's
a jolly good fellow %%

2136
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,885
%% For he's a jolly good fellow %%

2137
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:52,387
%% Which nobody can deny. %%

2138
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:53,388
What's wrong?

2139
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:54,889
Oh, it's the video.

2140
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,391
It's as if I never existed.

2141
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,393
As if what?
(applause and cheering)

2142
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,399
(cheering)

2143
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,902
Beck. A toast.

2144
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,904
Poppy.

2145
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,906
To Poppy.

2146
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:14,909
He's beginning to seem
perennial.

2147
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,912
We're observing
his centennial,

2148
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,914
so shout it

2149
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:21,416
from the chandeliers.

2150
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,419
We wish him another 100 years.

2151
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,920
(cheering)

2152
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,922
Happy birthday.

2153
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,424
Another one of those
everlasting rhymes of hers.

2154
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,428
POPPY:
I could eat
all of this myself.

2155
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,430
Let me take the baby.

2156
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,932
I'll deal with him.

2157
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,940
(baby crying)

2158
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,942
(sighs)

2159
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,949
(sighs)

2160
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,954
Oh, look at you.

2161
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:05,960
I know what you're thinking.

2162
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,464
What kind of people
have I ended up with?

2163
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,466
How am I ever going
to live

2164
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,968
on this planet?

2165
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,477
Come over here.
Look, look, look.

2166
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,979
(dings)

2167
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,990
Miserable day?

2168
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,494
Yeah.
Beck, you know that was
just Patch being Patch.

2169
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:40,995
Oh, listen,
what do I care?

2170
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,998
Before that, Nono asked me

2171
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:48,002
if Joe had married me
for my usefulness.

2172
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:51,005
Oh, believe me,
over the years, uh,

2173
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:54,008
that crossed my mind, too,

2174
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:58,012
especially after he just...
up and died,

2175
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,014
leaving me to cope
with all this.

2176
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,516
What are you
talking about?

2177
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:04,018
Oh...

2178
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:07,522
You know, when I first
met him right here,

2179
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,024
he said, uh,
"Oh, you look

2180
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:12,026
like you're having
a wonderful time."

2181
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:14,529
Well, you know, I wasn't having
a wonderful time.

2182
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,531
I should've just said that
to him right then.

2183
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,533
I was here,
too, you know,

2184
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,536
and I remember you
walking into the
Open Arms that day,

2185
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,538
and you were having
a wonderful time,

2186
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,540
and my brother saw in
you this gift of joy.

2187
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,041
Joy?

2188
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,543
Yeah, joy.

2189
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,044
I'm sure you know
that's something

2190
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,547
the Davich gene
pool sorely lacks.

2191
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:35,550
Believe me, you give
all of us such joy.

2192
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,552
Oh, well, it's not enough.

2193
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,053
It's more than enough;
how can we survive

2194
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:40,555
without it?
You'd survive.

2195
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:41,556
Not a chance.
I don't know.

2196
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,057
I know.

2197
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,561
I know you hold
all of us together

2198
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,063
with your love,
with your parties,

2199
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,566
with your funny
Rebecca toasts.

2200
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,569
Mm.

2201
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:58,072
We need you, Rebecca.

2202
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:05,580
(baby crying)

2203
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,583
Abdul's hungry, I think.

2204
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,587
Hmm... well, it wouldn't be
a family celebration

2205
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,590
if Min Foo wasn't
breast feeding.

2206
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,091
Well, I guess we
should go find her.

2207
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:18,092
Yeah.

2208
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,601
You're so young.
Yeah.

2209
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:30,104
He's hungry, honey.

2210
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,106
Beck, where you been?

2211
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:34,609
Champagne?

2212
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,111
Yes, thanks.

2213
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:42,617
Mom, I've run
out of diapers.

2214
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,619
Oh, honey, I think
there's an extra package

2215
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,121
underneath the sink.

2216
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,634
Why aren't you in the video?

2217
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:03,137
Well, I guess
I was busy planning

2218
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,640
some happening or other.

2219
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,142
(sound of train moving)

2220
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:18,152
Peter?

2221
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:26,661
Do you know I had a dream
about us?

2222
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,162
Really?

2223
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:29,664
What'd you dream about?

2224
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:35,169
Well, it was
a beautiful, sunny day...

2225
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:38,172
and you and I were on a train.

2226
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:39,674
Where were we going?

2227
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:45,179
Well, we were traveling to...

2228
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:49,183
to right here, I guess.

2229
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,686
We were coming home.

2230
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:54,188
Peter, can you
come here

2231
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:55,690
for a second?

2232
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,726
I see you're having
a wonderful time.

2233
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:39,734
Yes, Joe... I really am.

2234
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,738
BOY:
Poppy, what
did you wish for

2235
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,239
when you blew out
the candles?

2236
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:48,242
Oh, for an even
bigger party

2237
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,745
next year.

2238
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,247
GUESTS:
Here, here.
Absolutely.

2239
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,749
Yeah, yeah,
all right, let's go.

2240
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:07,695
(loud ding)

2241
01:37:58,003 --> 01:37:59,695
---the end---
