Bonnie: Ho, ho, howdy, everyone.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:12,567
That sure was a fun Christmas.

4
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:14,520
Hello, villagers!

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,586
Whoo!

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,721
'Scuse me! Pardon me! Thank you!

7
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:19,333
Hey, there, baby reindeer.

8
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,669
Let's spread some Christmas cheer!

9
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,837
I am the goblin fairy.

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:25,939
I'll make you the most beautiful of all.

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,674
Pling! Hooray!

12
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:29,043
Excuse me, miss.

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,744
There's a bug in my son's ice cream,

14
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,579
and he has a bug allergy!

15
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:34,515
There you go, sweetheart. Enjoy.

16
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,876
Oh, no! My dinosaur has escaped!

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,329
I'll find you!

18
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:42,532
- Did you hear that, Rex?
- I am a bit concerned.

19
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,123
No!

20
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,487
For once, I'm finally going to
get played with as a dinosaur!

21
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:46,888
Oh.

22
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,204
Prepare yourself. Inhabit the part.

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,565
You must not <i>play</i> the dinosaur.

24
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,700
You must <i>be</i> the dinosaur.

25
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:55,341
But I <i>am</i> the dinosaur.

26
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:59,172
Exactly! Now, get out there and sparkle.

[Gasps]

28
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:03,810
There she is!

29
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:06,613
The terrifying... Kittysaurus!

30
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:09,501
Oh, no! She laid millions of eggs!

31
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,884
Bloop, bloop, bloop.

32
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:11,915
Rawr!

Mom: Bonnie, get ready
to leave, okay, sweetie?

34
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:15,253
Coming!

35
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,847
To be continued.

36
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,451
Whoo! That was fun!

37
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:23,242
The way Bonnie's mind works
is a mystery of science.

38
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:24,508
You make a fantastic little dinosaur.

39
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,966
- Well done, Kitty.
- I was completely convinced.

40
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,234
I didn't know you had it in you.

41

[Clears throat]

42
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,268
Oh, and, um, your portrayal

43
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:33,748
of the disgruntled lunch
counter patron was gripping.

44
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:34,925
Aw, don't worry, Trixie.

45
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,815
Next time, you'll be a dinosaur for sure.

46
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,987
Andy used to play with me
like a dinosaur all the time.

47
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:40,914
Yeah, me too.

48
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,249
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

49
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,958
- How would I know?
- Good point.

50
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,328
Mom: Honey, why don't you bring
some toys to share with Mason?

51
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,841
I'll get my spaceship.

52
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:52,267
Santa Woody, villager, daddy
reindeer, baby reindeer,

53
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:55,061
and the terrifying Kittysaurus.

[Sighs]

55
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:59,366
Greet the world with an open heart.

56
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,400
Ugh!

57
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,890
Remember to be polite, now.

58
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,773
"Please" and "thank you."

59
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:05,513
Dad: Hey! Go on upstairs, Bonnie.

60
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:06,573
Mason's easy to find.

61
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,141
Mason!

62
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,545
Mason?

[Video game noises]

64
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,249
Whoa! Oh, duck!

65
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:17,384
Whoa. That was close.

66
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:18,785
Um...

67
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:20,013
[Gasps] You've got to be kidding me.

68
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,130
He got an Optimum X for Christmas!

69
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,404
I never knew Mason liked video games.

70
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,303
Sadly, the controls are
beyond my limitations.

71
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:32,599
Limitations are the shackles
we bind to ourselves.

72
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,167
Mason!!

73
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,468
Oh. Hey, Bonnie.

74
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,904
Whoa! You have got to check this out.

[Grunts]

76
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:39,839
Come on!

77
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,474
Oh. Okay.

78
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,310
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

79
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,146
- Buzz: Mayday! Mayday!
- Trixie: We're going in!

80
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:49,182
Aah!

81
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,183
Aah!

82
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,317
Whoa!

Everyone okay?

86
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,424
Rex: I guess we're not
getting played with after all.

87
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,687
Buzz: Well, who could blame her?

88
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,484
No one could resist an Optimum X.

89
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,777
Where is everybody?

90
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,639
Where's Socky and the little wrestlers

91
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,332
and the Eagle Force gang?

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,868
Looks like we got all afternoon
to find our old friends.

93
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,704
And maybe some new ones.

94
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:14,707
Wow. Mason really hit the
jackpot this Christmas.

95
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:15,635
Nobody's this good.

96
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:17,543
We're gonna meet some new toys!

97
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,545
I'm both excited and panic-stricken.

Trixie: "Battlesaurs,
the ultimate dinosaurs."

99
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,018

You guys, this play date
just got very interesting.

- [Snarling]
- Easy there, little doggie.

Speak swiftly, foolish outlanders,

Ooh. [Clears throat]

thirst for conquest.
