1
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:43,765
Good evening.
These uprisings,

2
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,200
The citizen revolutions
we've been covering

3
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:47,834
From the middle east
over to north africa,

4
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:50,203
Have been popping up
like thunderstorms.

5
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,744
a situation is unfolding
in libya.

6
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,181
Witnesses are hearing
gunfire and blasts

7
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,815
From rocket-propelled
grenades.

8
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:10,753
you have these moments

9
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,621
When an old world dies

10
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:14,356
And a new one
is not yet born.

11
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,790
And this is
a very dangerous

12
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,324
And perilous moment.

13
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:18,491
the whole region

14
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,359
Seems to be
on fire right now.

15
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,631
Now it's syria.

16
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,199
Syria exploded.

17
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,740
thousands of
syrians
have lost their lives

18
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,608
In the conflict
between forces

19
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,343
Loyal to president
bashar al-assad

20
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,745
And fighters opposed
to his rule.

21
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,851
the insurgency
has taken a turn

22
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:54,354
Towards a much more significant
islamic radicalization.

23
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:56,489
-Isis...
-Isis...
-Isis militants...

24
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,624
syria's newest conflict--

25
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:01,193
It's war within a war.

26
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:26,683
for three years,
we've been watching
the bloodshed in syria.

27
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,921
The same images of
war and violence

28
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,923
Seem to spread
across every channel

29
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:36,757
And every headline.

30
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,727
The result is fear.

31
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,563
Fear of terrorism,
fear of islam,

32
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,331
Fear of the middle east.

33
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,300
Drowned out
was the coverage

34
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:51,734
Of the 3 million syrians

35
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:54,336
Who have been
forced to flee their country,

36
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,972
Creating the largest refugee
crisis since world war ii.

37
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:04,744
As filmmakers, we immerse
ourselves in humanitarian
issues,

38
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:08,247
Living the reality we
are attempting to understand.

39
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,417
And in 2010,
we created a nonprofit

40
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,353
To help bring
these stories to life.

41
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,223
We hope to do this with
the syrian refugee crisis,

42
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:23,627
To take the time to hear
from refugees firsthand.

43
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,996
When the world
is turning away

44
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,298
And they've lost
everything,

45
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,601
What does their
future look like?

46
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,604
It took over a
year to make it possible,

47
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,572
But with jordan's
approval,

48
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,907
The un agreed
to register us

49
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,844
And give us a tent inside a
refugee camp in jordan.

50
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:45,646
It was the first time
that has ever been done.

51
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,318
of all districts,
where to put you?

52
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,353
We don't want to put you
in a congested area,

53
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:56,922
'cause that would
just be crazy,
so we're staying here.

54
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,623
The project
that you're doing

55
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,591
I don't think
has been done before

56
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,693
In a refugee camp
anywhere in the world.

57
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,999
for want of a better
term, as a sociological
experiment

58
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,734
Or as a piece of research,

59
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:14,570
In terms of how refugee
camps operate and run,

60
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,438
I think it'll be
very useful...

61
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,376
In a way that will help
unhcr and other agencies

62
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,777
Understand the dynamics

63
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,412
And the life
and the beat of a camp.

64
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:28,381
Your interactions with people

65
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:30,282
May not always be
positive and good.

66
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,683
Just be sensible.

67
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,960
we were traveling
to jordan,

68
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:44,962
A country that has taken
in

69
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,731
An estimated
1.4 million syrians

70
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,999
In just four years--

71
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,735
The equivalent of the
us providing refuge

72
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:55,804
For half the population
of mexico.

73
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:58,439
And jordan
is a small country,

74
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,375
About the size of indiana.

75
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:03,343
On its northern border

76
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:06,713
Is the second
largest refugee
camp in the world.

77
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:09,082
Just seven miles
from syria,

78
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:12,685
It's providing
shelter to
85,000 refugees.

79
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,737
Am binsawir.

80
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,394
Do you have any kind
of id, identification?

81
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,003
These are
the documents.

82
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,642
we were going
to be living in za'atari

83
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:53,644
For the next month.

84
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,979
Aside from paying
for what we received,

85
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:57,914
We were registered
in the same way

86
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,850
And given the same
supplies as refugees.

87
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,552
It would be up to
us to figure out

88
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,420
How to navigate life here.

89
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,702
I'm gonna get so lost
around this camp.

90
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,775
- is this home?
-Yes.

91
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,628
We don't want to anger
anyone on our first day.
Is there a problem?

92
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,944
right off the
bat, we had some anger
and confusion

93
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,879
About zach and me
filming women

94
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,780
And what we were
doing next to the kitchen

95
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:51,015
Where the women hang out.

96
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:54,151
But once we promised
we wouldn't film
anyone without permission,

97
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,085
Things quickly calmed
down.

98
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,290
Right away, people came
to help us set up our tent.

99
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,593
We couldn't tell if they were
refugees or aid workers,

100
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,728
But it turned out they lived in
the tents and trailers

101
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,130
Right next door.

102
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:12,265
Ah.

103
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,900
-It's like--
-so, like this?

104
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,843
Here, you hold
the shovel.

105
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,311
Okay, watch me.

106
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:36,817
You want to try?

107
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:37,951
Yeah.

108
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,937
Yes, very good.
Very good.

109
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,240
I think they're making
fun of my hammering skills,

110
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:06,908
But you know.

111
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:11,912
Okay.

112
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,325
-Oh, it needs a cylinder.
-Yeah, yeah.

113
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:38,702
He has a solution for you.

114
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:40,637
He could us
something like--

115
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,239
They call it a melon.
It looks like a melon.

116
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:53,048
He's our neighbor.

117
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,150
Yeah, he said
that we are neighbors,
and we should--

118
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:57,885
He will give us--
he will give us--

119
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,827
Oh, look at this.

120
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,329
Good thing we all
forgot toothpaste.

121
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,797
So that's helpful.

122
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,909
he's teaching you
how to use them.

123
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,144
I know how to
use that, raouf.

124
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,313
Oh, this is...

125
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,456
oh, uh, mice can open this

126
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,390
And they start eating.

127
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:49,027
Let's put this back inside.

128
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:54,965
Let's see what we know.

129
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,904
this is za'atari camp.

130
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:05,074
It's about 2 1/2
miles by 1 1/2 miles,

131
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,243
And it's broken
into 12 districts here.

132
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,979
And then our tent is
here in district 5.

133
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:17,451
These camps like
za'atar exist all over the world

134
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:19,453
In 40 different countries.

135
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:22,155
Wherever the camps
are, they have to follow the
laws

136
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:23,789
Of that host country,

137
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,791
Even though many
are set up and managed

138
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:26,992
By the united nations.

139
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:31,096
In za'atari,
the un works

140
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:35,066
With over 33 nonprofits
to run the camp.

141
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:38,302
It's a massive operation
to provide tents and trailers,

142
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:42,172
Trucks of clean
water, daily food distributions,

143
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,474
Hospitals
and community centers,

144
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:47,944
And even school
up to the 12th grade.

145
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,889
Za'atari is patrolled
by the  jordanian police,

146
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:03,424
And they have the final
say on security in the camp.

147
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:09,862
Why are they telling us
it's too dangerous now?

148
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,537
That was just security...

149
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:22,572
That stopped by
our tent.

150
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:24,907
And...

151
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,942
They're saying
it's too dangerous

152
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,376
For us to stay overnight.

153
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:30,578
So...

154
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,416
Um, the one person
we can talk to

155
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:40,186
Is the local
district leader.

156
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:42,021
Just gotta pack
our stuff up

157
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,356
And go to his tent.

158
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:46,558
Is there any way
you can ask security

159
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,960
To let us stay
overnight in the camp?

160
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,429
Do you have any idea
why they would've
changed their minds?

161
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,467
after all of our planning,

162
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,168
Security changed
their mind,

163
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,103
And we couldn't
stay overnight in the camp.

164
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:38,972
Good-bye, district 5.

165
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:41,307
It was for our own safety.

166
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,342
We had to head
to the town of mafraq,

167
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:45,344
About seven miles
from za'atari.

168
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,619
It was disappointing,
but it actually showed us

169
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,222
A completely different
side of the refugee
crisis in jordan.

170
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,026
80% of refugees
here live outside of camps,

171
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,460
In urban cities,

172
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:08,196
Relying on jordanian
generosity.

173
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:11,933
But in a country with high
unemployment and limited
resources,

174
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:15,169
How long can people
continue to welcome
in new refugees?

175
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:30,416
We had a hard time
finding anywhere to stay.

176
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,351
The city was so
crowded with syrians,

177
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,985
Rent prices had tripled

178
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,987
Since the war
began three years ago.

179
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,091
Luckily, ibraheem
found us a storage room

180
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,725
In the back
of an office building

181
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,227
Where we could
spend our nights
for the next month.

182
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:45,152
-Thank you.
-We're making
some tea for you.

183
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:56,293
it wasn't long

184
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:58,028
Before people
started coming into our tent

185
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,562
To ask us questions

186
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:02,031
Or just say hi.

187
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:05,467
Right away, we
were a new source of amusement

188
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:07,202
For raouf and his friends.

189
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:13,607
Oh! Yeah!

190
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:21,146
It really started to
feel like a routine.

191
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:28,085
Every day we'd
leave from mafraq late a
night...

192
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,154
And then be back
in the camp again

193
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,488
By 6 a.M.

194
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,198
one of the first
people we became close with

195
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,633
Was this guy named
ismail, and it was--

196
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:25,737
It was wild, because ismail
looked just like my dad in
college.

197
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,538
And even acted like him.

198
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,807
They both love to cook.

199
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,610
What?

200
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,645
You're a master.

201
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,279
Beautiful.

202
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,387
Even had a very
similar sense of humor.

203
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,327
Before the war,
ismail was studying

204
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,297
At a university in
damascus to be a french teacher.

205
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,266
And as soon as the war started,
he had to flee the country,

206
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,668
Leaving everything
he knew behind.

207
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:11,439
He was one of the
first refugees in za'atari

208
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,374
When it opened
two years ago.

209
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,144
Why did you decide
to leave syria?

210
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:26,151
Was there a particular--

211
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:27,752
Like, when did you
choose to?

212
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:30,421
Was there a reason?
Something that happened?

213
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,351
every month,
tens of thousands
of people like ismail

214
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:38,687
Attempt the journey
out of syria.

215
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:42,424
95%  seek refuge
in egypt, lebanon,

216
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,794
Iraq, turkey and jordan.

217
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:48,963
With 80% of syria's
infrastructure destroyed

218
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:51,398
By the ongoing violence,

219
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,701
Families often spend
their entire savings on guides

220
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:56,636
Who will smuggle
them through the war zone

221
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:59,838
And eventually over the border
in the middle of the night.

222
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:10,915
We can proudly say that
when they come here,

223
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:13,617
That is when they can
actually breathe

224
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:16,019
And actually relax
and sleep.

225
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:25,761
It's important
to see people,

226
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:28,497
Check those who need
immediate assistance.

227
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:31,299
The very first, um, step

228
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,668
Is that of receiving water.

229
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,436
They've been traveling,

230
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:39,039
Yet again another step in a long
journey towards safety.

231
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,408
The second thing
is the vaccination.

232
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,843
They need full protection.

233
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:50,015
these services
rely on international aid

234
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:51,549
And private donations.

235
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:55,986
Sadly, the un
has only received

236
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:57,921
A little over half
of the funding

237
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:01,324
That donor countries
have promised for this crisis.

238
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:23,033
They're astonished, like,
how americans want to
live the same like--

239
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:25,602
astonished
in a good way or--

240
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,036
-Not in a good way.
-Okay.

241
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,966
thank you for
inviting us to your home.

242
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,169
And actually, we haven't
even seen many of these
types of food.

243
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:19,204
Could they explain to us
what they are?

244
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,878
and this is
olive oil and thyme.

245
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,718
- Aww!

246
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,165
so, where did you
learn to do all of these
hanging crafts?

247
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:01,376
Does it cost a lot
to make these?

248
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:12,445
with jordan's
high unemployment rate,

249
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:14,880
It's almost impossible
for refugees

250
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:17,415
To get visas
to legally work.

251
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:20,084
But inside the contained
space of the camp,

252
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:21,952
Jordan is more lenient,

253
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:25,088
Allowing more informal
business to start.

254
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,258
This is how um ali
sold her vase to an aid worker.

255
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,427
The law also prevents
refugees from leaving the camp

256
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:35,263
Unless they have
a jordanian sponsor.

257
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:37,064
But in order
to make a living,

258
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,433
Syrian refugees
overcome this barrier

259
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:41,435
By partnering
with jordanians,

260
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:44,171
Who bring supplies
in and out of the camp.

261
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:47,440
Syrians are finding ways
to work and be productive

262
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:49,809
By any means possible.

263
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:55,113
Here you have 100,000 people
in front of you,

264
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:56,481
And all that
they're begging for

265
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:58,916
Is to be recognized
as human beings

266
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:01,885
And not be just served
some assistance

267
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:04,554
Which may not always be adapted
to what they want.

268
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,459
people were showing us

269
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:14,162
That they have a different
concept of the space,

270
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:18,799
A different concept of how their
settlement should look like.

271
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,569
We were building a camp.

272
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,305
They were building a city.

273
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:28,007
in just two years,
syrian refugees

274
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,976
Have developed
a multi-million-dollar economy.

275
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:35,413
At the center of the camp
is a thriving market street

276
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:37,415
Jokingly named
the champs-elysées.

277
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,817
We're riding
on a donkey

278
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,451
Through the
champs-elysées.

279
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:46,120
With over
3,000 business,

280
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:48,589
You can buy
almost anything.

281
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:50,891
The un  has never
seen a camp's economy

282
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:53,293
Expand so quickly.

283
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:55,862
Many camps forbid
this kind of growth.

284
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:59,065
But syrians were determined
to rebuild their new lives.

285
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:02,435
And the un has even
begun to embrace this vision,

286
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:05,971
Putting za'atari
in a league all of its own.

287
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:10,908
In addition to
this bustling economy,

288
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,911
Our neighbors are
investing in their homes.

289
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:17,847
They're moving
trailers to be near family

290
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,481
And building
makeshift houses

291
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:22,250
That have bedrooms, gardens,

292
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:25,920
Private bathrooms,
and even fountains.

293
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:29,223
This kind of growth
in za'atari is remarkable.

294
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:32,459
But without the workings
of the city to support it,

295
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:34,494
It can only go so far.

296
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:43,067
In za'atari, there are
no household-level water

297
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,235
And sewage systems.

298
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,171
And the electrical grid
is completely overloaded.

299
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,475
there are
limits to what we,

300
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,544
As humanitarians,
can do.

301
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,113
We are good
as humanitarians,

302
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,315
As we are,
as the system is,

303
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,350
To provide first aid.

304
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:04,919
But we don't have
the capacity to work

305
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:07,888
On medium- and
long-term strategies.

306
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,324
We can pretend it,
but we don't have it.

307
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:13,459
nonprofits and the un

308
00:32:13,461 --> 00:32:15,627
Don't have the
expertise to set up a city.

309
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:19,430
They need support from city
planners and private companies

310
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:21,331
To effectively run za'atari.

311
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,967
But the world hasn't stepped up

312
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:28,437
To support jordanians,
the un  or syrians

313
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:30,972
To pursue this kind of vision.

314
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:34,308
Currently, za'atari
remains a short-term solution

315
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,510
For a long-term problem.

316
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:08,074
as we headed
into mafraq,

317
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:09,675
It was almost
too much to think

318
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:11,343
That za'atari
is only a fraction

319
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:13,578
Of the refugees
in jordan.

320
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,581
Most syrians
live outside of the camp.

321
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,449
And one was our
neighbor ghoussoon.

322
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,953
Like so many
of the families here,

323
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:24,988
She's the head
of her household.

324
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,223
One in four families
are led by a woman

325
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:29,959
Because so many
men are still in syria.

326
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:32,728
When did you make
that journey?

327
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,398
Did you make it by yourself from
syria to mafraq?

328
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,326
It's not easy. From
a gender perspective,

329
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:09,595
Many women are expected
to stay inside the home.

330
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:11,530
Of course, if you
have a female-headed
household,

331
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,164
The woman doesn't
really have a choice.

332
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,598
She has to leave
the home to find

333
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,733
Some kind of support
for her family,

334
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,534
Financial
or otherwise.

335
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,273
Wow.

336
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:35,441
Incredible.

337
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:40,378
even now,
when you have to provide

338
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,146
For your whole family,

339
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:43,680
Um, is there ever,
you know--

340
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:45,548
Would you ever think
about going to za'atari,

341
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,285
Where they give you free food
or they give you, uh...

342
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:50,552
Different services?

343
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:54,755
ghoussoon
arrived in jordan

344
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:57,124
Before the refugee
camps were set up.

345
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:59,626
She chooses not
to relocate to za'atari

346
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:01,628
Because she believes
she can build

347
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,631
A more traditional
home for her kids
outside of the camp,

348
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:07,867
Where they can go
to public jordanian
schools.

349
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,504
Hey!

350
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,745
Who drew on this?
What is this?

351
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,483
We have graffiti
on our--

352
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:05,918
-Oh, yeah.
-I can't tell--
at least it's a heart.

353
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:10,221
It says
"raouf's tent"?

354
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:12,756
No, really?
Does it really?

355
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,426
It says
"raouf's tent"?

356
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:21,363
-Raouf?
-Abdel raouf.

357
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,864
Did you do these?

358
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,202
Thank you.

359
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,738
My man raouf,
let's get inside.
It's cold.

360
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,606
Yeah, it's cold.
Aren't you freezing?

361
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,380
Did you clean--

362
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:49,484
You cleaned the--

363
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,287
Aw, raouf.

364
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,921
Raouf, sit on
the mattress.

365
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,422
I appreciate that.

366
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,224
Dude, this kid
is the man.

367
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:01,759
Did you go to school
in syria?

368
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,596
What grade were you in
when you left?

369
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:14,569
So, uh, what do you
want to be

370
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:16,237
When you, uh, grow up?

371
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,874
You want to be
a doctor? Nice.

372
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:23,443
Have you always wanted
to be a doctor?

373
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:27,813
He wants to help
the injured people.

374
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,481
You want to help
the injured people?

375
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,917
Like, the people
back in syria?

376
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:41,557
There's a lot of school
before you can become
a doctor.

377
00:38:49,298 --> 00:38:50,965
And you're willing
to do it all?

378
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,936
Yeah? Wow.

379
00:38:56,938 --> 00:38:59,638
Well, maybe--
can you be my doctor
when I'm--

380
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,340
When you're a doctor?
I would love to
have a doctor.

381
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,282
it's been
almost two years now,

382
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:14,784
And raouf still doesn't
want to go to school.

383
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,719
He says he doesn't
want to go

384
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,088
Until he's back at
home in syria.

385
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,895
We've been trying to
convince him to start
again,

386
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,030
But the sad truth of it
is,

387
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:32,400
Only half of refugee
kids are getting an education.

388
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:44,143
What's up, raouf? Hey.

389
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:45,444
Are you gonna
go today?

390
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:52,050
-He doesn't know?
-He doesn't.

391
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:53,584
You don't know?

392
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,519
Well, you have--
what time is it?

393
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,621
-It's almost 12:00.
-30 minutes.

394
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:59,689
Why don't you want to go today?
Why don't you go?

395
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:06,861
They'll help you
find your class, raouf.

396
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,596
Right when you
walk in--

397
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:10,965
And we can even walk
with you down there,
if you want,

398
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:13,567
And then,
when you walk in,

399
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,769
The organization
will help show you
where you class is,

400
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,137
And you're
all registered,

401
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:18,605
So you won't have
anything to worry about.

402
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:22,608
No?

403
00:40:27,046 --> 00:40:29,881
Raouf, like, why don't
you want to go to school?

404
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:33,550
Because you can
go to school
if you want to go.

405
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,591
Why don't you
eat right now,
then let's go?

406
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:49,529
I promise you,
you could be there
in ten minutes.

407
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:00,872
Why don't we go?
We'll prove you wrong.

408
00:43:22,242 --> 00:43:24,676
I had no idea
that it was, like--

409
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:26,577
It's trauma-based.

410
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,879
Not, like, it's--
I mean--

411
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:31,715
I think there's so many
factors involved now.

412
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:33,817
But he's just scared.

413
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,820
And, like, he has
a reason to be...

414
00:43:39,155 --> 00:43:41,623
Yeah, no ten-year-old
should ever have
to live with that.

415
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:47,961
Jesus.

416
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,998
You can have
some water, raouf.

417
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,638
Your life
is way more complicated
than we thought it was.

418
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,306
What's up, buddy?

419
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,940
Did you beat zach
at soccer?

420
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,142
You beat him up?

421
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:36,070
Because it's, like,
a combination

422
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:40,240
Of, like, a lot of
things that all come
together at one time.

423
00:44:48,983 --> 00:44:51,250
It's, like, always
just right under
the surface,

424
00:44:51,252 --> 00:44:53,051
Where you meet
so many people

425
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:55,153
Who are just, like,
always so friendly,

426
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:59,223
Always talking.
You don't even notice
anything's wrong at all.

427
00:44:59,225 --> 00:45:02,392
And then you just
hear more about--

428
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:05,061
It's, like, one fact
about one person.

429
00:45:05,063 --> 00:45:08,130
And that is something
that I could never
even imagine.

430
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:15,369
I don't really want
to talk about it.

431
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:25,324
within minutes,
the failure of the peace
conference in geneva

432
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:29,795
2,000 miles away set
off a camp-wide demonstration.

433
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:43,873
The refugees were voicing
their disapproval

434
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,941
Of the ongoing war
in syria

435
00:47:45,943 --> 00:47:48,576
And showing support
for those left behind.

436
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:54,480
And even though these protests
will eventually disperse,

437
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:58,317
The fighting just seven miles
away rages on.

438
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:18,169
this is
the tip of the iceberg

439
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:19,837
In za'atari.

440
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,874
It's where you can see and
feel the conflict, actually.

441
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:26,142
You hear the fighting.

442
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,180
...Which we are not--

443
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:35,317
at times,
our offices here have shook

444
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:38,152
Because of the closeness
of mortar fire.

445
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:42,923
You never get
a mental break from that.

446
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:46,393
You're always thinking
about who's still at home.

447
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:49,229
People are trying to
build a normal life,

448
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:50,863
But are finding it tough.

449
00:53:13,752 --> 00:53:15,586
and what
is this again?

450
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,291
And why
is he lonely?

451
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:40,374
Is this a man who lost
all of his children?

452
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:42,142
yes.

453
00:53:42,144 --> 00:53:43,776
Do you know anyone
who's like this,

454
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:45,310
Who lost all of
their children?

455
00:56:02,646 --> 00:56:04,279
what do you do
at the women's center?

456
00:56:59,568 --> 00:57:00,768
So, you need
to teach us

457
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,102
So we can--
so we can make--

458
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:09,108
the center
was clearly a home
away from home for her,

459
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,376
A place where
she had friends,

460
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:13,811
Community,
access to help.

461
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:16,980
She'd even begun
to work alongside
the jordanian staff,

462
00:57:16,982 --> 00:57:18,681
Teaching art.

463
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,740
it's a very,
very important point--

464
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:57,908
Opportunity
out of crisis.

465
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,710
And that's something
we're underestimating.

466
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:04,580
I mean, we're
focusing so much
on these responses.

467
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,615
Yes, we have
to make sure that
people are warm,

468
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:10,051
Have proper shelter,
food, water, and so on
and so forth.

469
00:59:10,053 --> 00:59:12,686
But we're forgetting
that it's really
an opportunity

470
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:15,188
To have time
to develop and think

471
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,889
And learn things.
In that sense,

472
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:20,092
We have obligation
to invest in
the human capital

473
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,960
Which this presents.

474
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:00,762
"arr."

475
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,932
No, you're
saying it, "argh."

476
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,934
I can't roll my rs.
"arr."

477
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:22,647
Sean cheats.

478
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:23,848
Yes.

479
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,316
Ha ha! What is that?

480
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:27,184
Have you ever seen
an outfit like this?

481
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:40,028
This is really difficult.
How do you say "difficult"?

482
01:01:26,206 --> 01:01:28,340
sitting there
in the tent,

483
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:33,378
We realized
just how vulnerable raouf
and his friends really are.

484
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,215
Watching them play
these violent video games
on their phones--

485
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:39,684
At first it seemed
like nothing.

486
01:01:39,686 --> 01:01:42,720
But for these
kids, it's their reality.

487
01:01:42,722 --> 01:01:46,957
It's a reality
that's knocking on the door
right across the border.

488
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:51,127
Extremist groups
like al-nusra and isis,

489
01:01:51,129 --> 01:01:54,396
They want to prey on
and exploit kids

490
01:01:54,398 --> 01:01:56,831
Who don't have
access to education,

491
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,900
Kids who are
in desperate situations.

492
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:06,205
When we think
about the people we've met
in this camp--

493
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:07,940
Raouf's family...

494
01:02:07,942 --> 01:02:10,008
-Ahh!
-Okay.

495
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,342
Ismail...

496
01:02:14,913 --> 01:02:16,847
All of our friends here--

497
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,816
They have chosen
peace over war,

498
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,350
To leave the fighting,

499
01:02:21,352 --> 01:02:23,719
To leave the extremists
like isis,

500
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:25,854
Who they've even
renamed "daesh",

501
01:02:25,856 --> 01:02:29,290
An insulting name derived from
the word "to trample".

502
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:38,731
-Hey!
-Hey!

503
01:02:45,837 --> 01:02:48,371
to help the kids
here, ismail and his friends

504
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:51,006
Volunteer at one
of the many children's centers
in the camp.

505
01:02:51,008 --> 01:02:52,874
Very good, very good.

506
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,186
just like
the women's centers,

507
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:47,055
These children's centers
are designed for trauma.

508
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:49,123
They provide safe spaces,

509
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,525
Running simple activities
that promote healing

510
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,060
And help prevent children
just like raouf

511
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:56,395
From slipping
too far behind

512
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:58,997
Or not returning
to school altogether.

513
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:02,500
These centers
don't replace schools,

514
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:05,536
But instead gets kids
ready to go back to them.

515
01:05:59,213 --> 01:06:01,147
after four years
of the war,

516
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:04,450
The burden of refugees in
countries neighboring syria

517
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:06,652
Has reached
a breaking point,

518
01:06:06,654 --> 01:06:09,688
Forcing them to often
effectively close their borders

519
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:12,323
To those fleeing
the violence.

520
01:06:12,325 --> 01:06:15,025
6.5 million people
remain displaced

521
01:06:15,027 --> 01:06:17,694
From their homes
inside of syria.

522
01:06:17,696 --> 01:06:20,496
This is the moment
where countries
all over the world

523
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:24,199
Need to open their borders
to syrians in need

524
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:27,235
And to support host countries,
like jordan,

525
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:29,470
Who have already
welcomed so many,

526
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:31,338
Yet do not have
the resources

527
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,673
To provide the dignity
refugees deserve--

528
01:06:35,142 --> 01:06:38,043
The housing,
jobs and education,

529
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:40,645
That will not only help
stabilize the region,

530
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:43,214
But help save
an entire generation.

531
01:06:45,183 --> 01:06:48,051
The world has been so wrapped
up in the violence,

532
01:06:48,053 --> 01:06:50,553
We have forgotten
that this dignity

533
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:53,055
Is what creates
lasting peace.

534
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:03,998
Today is
the last day, but--

535
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:07,668
We hope that, too.
No matter what,

536
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:10,470
We will--we will
come and visit again.

537
01:07:39,565 --> 01:07:42,733
No, not at all.
And I think--

538
01:07:42,735 --> 01:07:45,168
Especially--I think
it was in conversation
with you--

539
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:46,636
We talked about
how there's--

540
01:07:46,638 --> 01:07:48,638
There are good and bad
people in every society.

541
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,508
And that's the same
in the states
as it is here.

542
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,576
Before we came, we had
no idea what to expect.

543
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:56,311
We didn't know
if we'd be welcomed

544
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:58,313
Or if we'd booted
out of the camp.

545
01:07:58,315 --> 01:08:00,648
But we've been,
from the very beginning,

546
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:04,018
Felt like people have,
you know, welcomed us in

547
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,454
And, over time, have become
very close friends with
all of you.

548
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:19,499
What we've really
come away with is,
you know,

549
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:21,734
We're not just syrians
and americans,

550
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:24,136
But we really are
neighbors.

551
01:08:24,138 --> 01:08:26,138
And when neighbors
are in need,

552
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,340
Hopefully they
can come together
and help each other.

553
01:08:31,643 --> 01:08:34,611
it was humbling
sitting there
on that last day,

554
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:39,248
Being surrounded
by people who have
overcome so many obstacles,

555
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,317
But despite everything,
still have hope

556
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,519
And generously opened their
homes and hearts to us.

557
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:52,258
We're headed home,
but our friends are not.

558
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,660
On average, refugees
are stuck in camps

559
01:08:54,662 --> 01:08:56,161
For 17 years.

560
01:08:58,464 --> 01:09:02,132
It would be a tragedy
to lose the potential
of this population...

561
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:05,835
When they are
the solution,

562
01:09:05,837 --> 01:09:08,504
The ones who will
rebuild syria,

563
01:09:08,506 --> 01:09:10,372
Or will work
to rebuild their lives

564
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:12,407
In countries
that provide them homes.

565
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:17,178
This isn't just the story
of the millions fleeing war

566
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,647
Or the neighboring countries
who have welcomed them in.

567
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:23,149
This is a story
about breaking a cycle

568
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:25,484
Of distrust and violence,

569
01:09:25,486 --> 01:09:27,719
About creating
understanding.

570
01:09:29,321 --> 01:09:31,422
Because, as neighbors,

571
01:09:31,424 --> 01:09:34,324
How we choose to
respond to this crisis

572
01:09:34,326 --> 01:09:36,392
Will affect all of us.
