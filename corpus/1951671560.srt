1
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,557
Poor Mr Adamson had no idea we were
having a ball at the beginning of his visit.

2
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,832
Your father thought more of his eagerness
to see Mr Adamson's specimens

3
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,111
than he did of our own
projected entertainment.

4
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,237
Fortunately, he's much
of a height with Edgar,

5
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,238
who was able to help him with a suit.

6
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,514
I should've had no dress suit in any event.

7
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,519
All my earthly belongings have burned
or drowned or both in the shipwreck.

8
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,835
And they never included a dress suit.

9
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,678
Well, well.

10
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,591
You must be possessed of immense
resources of strength and courage.

11
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,554
I'm sure they'll be equal
to a turn around the dance floor.

12
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,195
Once learned, a waltz
can never be forgotten.

13
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,190
Are you free to dance?

14
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,391
Yes.

15
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,956
My father was so sorry to hear you'd lost
so much in the terrible shipwreck.

16
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,200
For your sake and for his own.
He was eager to add to his collection.

17
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,031
Well, I did manage to save one or two
of the rarest, most beautiful butterflies.

18
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,630
I suppose there's a certain bathos
in saving a dead butterfly.

19
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,194
But one in particular is such a rarity...

20
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,269
I'll say no more now, but I believe
your father will be glad to have it.

21
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,197
And you too.

22
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,630
But it's to be a surprise, really.

23
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,551
I hate people who tell me I am to have
a surprise and will not tell me what it is.

24
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,591
You don't like suspense?

25
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,278
No.

26
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,311
No, I don't.

27
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,795
I am afraid of surprises.

28
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,313
I must remember
never to surprise you, then.

29
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,474
Stop, there! How dare you?!

30
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,034
What did you do to her?

31
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,517
I'm so sorry. I've no idea.
I can't imagine what I might've done.

32
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,030
Well, something must've happened,
mustn't it?

33
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,118
Too much dancing, I'll be bound.

34
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,394
Eugenia loves to dance.
She can't get enough of it.

35
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,317
I see.

36
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,115
I am Eugenia's brother,
and thereby her protector.

37
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,071
It's nothing.

38
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,156
Good, good.

39
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,033
Well now, more dancing.

40
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,239
Well? Let's have some more dancing.

41
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,673
Please excuse Eugenia's behaviour.
She's not feeling herself.

42
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,552
It's of no importance.

43
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,152
Her leaving the ball was no reflection
on your behaviour. None at all.

44
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,113
- Well, I hope she'll feel better soon.
- Indeed.

45
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,313
Although I'm not sure
she will ever be the same again.

46
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,150
She was to be married, you see.

47
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,078
Only her fiancé, Captain Hunt,
died quite suddenly.

48
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,829
It was a terrible shock.
Poor Eugenia's only just recovering.

49
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,078
We don't talk about it.
But everybody knows, of course.

50
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,432
I'm not tittle-tattling. I just thought
it might be helpful to you to know.

51
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,916
I see. Thank you very much for telling me.

52
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,390
You are very fortunate to have escaped
with your life, and we must be glad of that.

53
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,516
But the loss of your specimens
must have been a very severe setback.

54
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,157
What will you do, Mr Adamson?
If you do not think it impertinent to ask.

55
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,678
I have hardly had time to think.

56
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,429
Your own family cannot help?

57
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,675
No.

58
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,794
My father's a butcher. And even if he had
the wherewithal, I could not ask him.

59
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,040
I'd hoped to sell enough to be able
to stay in England, write about my travels,

60
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,039
and perhaps earn enough money
to equip myself to return to the Amazons.

61
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,994
We've barely begun to pick up twigs, sir,
those of us who've worked there.

62
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,114
There are millions of unexplored miles,
countless unknown creatures.

63
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,360
And yet I've never felt more
profoundly alone than I did there.

64
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,313
You were so very kind in your letters, sir,

65
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,958
the receipt of which was one of my
very few moments of luxury in the forest.

66
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,152
I used to ration the reading
so as to savour them longer,

67
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,999
as one rations sugar and flour.

68
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,596
Well, I am glad to have given
such pleasure to anyone.

69
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,514
I've brought you something rare.
Something very rare.

70
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,914
They fly in the broad, sunny roads
in the forest.

71
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,273
They float very slowly, occasionally
flapping their wings like birds.

72
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,756
And they almost never come down
below 20 feet,

73
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,190
so they are almost impossible to catch.

74
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,029
But I employed
some agile little Indian boys,

75
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,756
and they were able to climb up
and fetch me this pair.

76
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,677
Now, I must confess I did not know then

77
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,157
how appropriate they were
to add to your collection.

78
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,989
<i>They are Morpho eugenia, Sir Harald.</i>

79
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,354
Well!

80
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,158
What a lovely creature.

81
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,150
What a beautiful glittering blue she is.

82
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,592
No, he. It's the male who is blue.
The female is the tawny brown.

83
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,477
What a pity.

84
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,797
I prefer the shimmering blue.

85
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,789
But then, I am female, so that is natural.

86
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,956
It is hard not to agree
with the Duke of Argyle

87
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,878
that the extraordinary beauty
of these creatures

88
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,549
is in itself evidence
of the work of a Creator.

89
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,755
A Creator who also gave us
human sensitivity to beauty, to design,

90
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,000
to delicate variation and brilliant colour.

91
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,480
From our spontaneous response
to them, sir,

92
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,388
I feel instinctively drawn
to agree with you.

93
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,753
But, from a scientific point of view,
I feel I must ask what purpose of nature's

94
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,829
might be fulfilled
by all this brilliance and loveliness.

95
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,633
Mr Darwin, I know,
inclines to think that the fact

96
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,311
that it is preponderantly male butterflies
and birds that are so brilliantly coloured,

97
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,432
while the females
are often drab and unobtrusive,

98
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,032
suggests there's some advantage to the
male in flaunting his scarlets and golds

99
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,436
that might help make the female
select him as a mate.

100
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,996
Could the drabness of the female
be protective?

101
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,918
Oh, yes, definitely. Mr Wallace...

102
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,553
Oh!

103
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,795
Don't worry, my dear.

104
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,115
Forgive me, Mama.

105
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,915
Did you live entirely
without the company of civilised people?

106
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
Among naked savages?

107
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,676
Not entirely.

108
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,874
I had various friends
of all colours and races

109
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,629
during my stays in various communities.

110
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,677
But... yes, sometimes I suppose I was
the only white guest in tribal villages.

111
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,949
Are they really naked? And painted?

112
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,676
Some are. Some are partly clothed,
some wholly clothed.

113
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,753
They are greatly given to decorating
their skins with vegetable dyes.

114
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,877
These floating clumps of twigs
and grasses even remind me

115
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,792
of the great floating islands
of upturned trees, creepers and bushes

116
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,390
that make their way down the great river.

117
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,354
<i>I used to compare those
to the passage in Paradise Lost</i>

118
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,109
where paradise is cast loose
after the Deluge.

119
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,516
"Then shall this mount of Paradise
by might of waves be moved

120
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,074
Out of his place,
pushed by the horned flood,

121
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,555
With all his verdure spoiled,
and trees adrift,

122
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,148
Down the great river to the opening gulf,

123
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,316
And there take root an island
salt and bare,

124
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,115
The haunt of seals, and orcs,
and sea-mews' clang. "

125
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,635
Clever Matty.

126
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,037
Lady Alabaster would be pleased
if you would take tea with her

127
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,754
when you've finished your work.

128
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,238
You seem to have undertaken
quite a labour of love.

129
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,557
What's that? It looks quite alarming.

130
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,919
It's become detached from whatever
specimen it was attached to, I think.

131
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,635
Several parts of several specimens
have become detached.

132
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,639
I keep a special box for the most puzzling.

133
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,677
This foot and leg obviously belong
to some fairly large quadrumane.

134
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,799
You might suppose
they were those of some human infant.

135
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,354
But I can assure you they're not.

136
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,550
The bones are too light.

137
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,314
I must look as if I'm practising witchcraft.

138
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,716
No. I didn't mean to suggest such a thing.

139
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,478
Of course not.

140
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,479
Indeed, I've noticed you take
a great interest in the natural sciences.

141
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,071
Everyone seems to be taking an interest
in the natural sciences

142
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,510
since your arrival here, Mr Adamson.

143
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,871
Well, it's a worthwhile pursuit, I hope.

144
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,551
My father seems to think so.
Which is fortunate for you.

145
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,353
It's saved you from the poorhouse, I'd say.

146
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,430
My origins are humble,
but I doubt it would've come to that.

147
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,516
Oh, hopefully not.

148
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,313
Indeed, my father's charity
has served you rather well.

149
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,590
Your father's been very kind.

150
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,235
And I'm pleased to be able to repay him
by organising his collection

151
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,796
according to scientific principles.

152
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,229
How long will the job take?

153
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,434
Well, that depends on what I find
in this mountain of boxes.

154
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,679
Well, then it could take for ever,
I'll wager.

155
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,360
Especially since you have
nowhere else to go.

156
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,917
I'm so sorry, I must leave now.
I have to take tea with Lady Alabaster.

157
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,476
Well, while you're "taking tea"
with my mother

158
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,116
and talking about whatever it is
that you talk to my father about,

159
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,550
just don't get too comfortable.

160
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,270
You're not one of us.

161
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,638
I am aware of that. Good day.

162
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,316
Come in, Matty.

163
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,837
Mr Adamson is here, Lady Alabaster.

164
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,832
<i>I hope you are comfortable here?</i>

165
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,349
Oh, yes. Very much so.

166
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,519
My husband is not
overburdening you with work?

167
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,153
No.

168
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,670
I've a great deal of spare time, in fact.
This way...

169
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,839
Lady Alabaster expressed the hope that
you might be able to spare a little time

170
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,712
helping Miss Mead and myself

171
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,515
in the scientific education
of the younger members of the family.

172
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,749
She feels that they should profit from the
presence of so distinguished a naturalist.

173
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,473
Of course I'd be happy to do what I can.

174
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,038
Matty has such good ideas.
So ingenious, she is.

175
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,672
Tell him, Matty.

176
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,995
Lady Alabaster's twins are too small,

177
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,193
but I have already taken
the three older girls on rambles.

178
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,039
I would be delighted to help.

179
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,117
We shall truly profit
from your presence amongst us.

180
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,712
<i>Oh, look!</i>

181
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,870
<i>The queen seems scarcely of the
same species as her rapid little servants.</i>

182
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,468
We've attempted
to keep these insects before.

183
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,879
We have a deathly touch, it appears.
The creatures simply curl up and die.

184
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,073
Well, you probably
had not captured a queen.

185
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,115
Ants are social beings. They exist
only for the good of the whole nest.

186
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,118
And the centre of that nest
is the queen ant,

187
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,392
whose laying and feeding
the others all tend ceaselessly.

188
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,275
I'd like to believe humankind
capable of such altruistic behaviour.

189
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,599
Though, when I look around me, I think
a socialist society may never be realised.

190
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,596
Well, you think a great deal,
Miss Crompton, for...

191
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,392
For a woman.

192
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,311
You were about to say "for a woman",
and then refrained. Which was courteous.

193
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,398
It's my great amusement, thinking.

194
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,592
<i>Mr Swinnerton, would you
be so kind as to help me dismount?</i>

195
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,434
It was wonderful, wasn't it?

196
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:41,119
<i>1860-253, Ventnor, Isle of Wight,
Lystus fulvibabis...</i>

197
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:47,271
Young Mr Swinnerton
wishes to marry my daughter.

198
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,356
I have given permission.

199
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,792
He says he already knows
what she will say.

200
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,037
So you must wish me joy.

201
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,511
I do indeed.

202
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,871
The first fledgling out of the nest.

203
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,958
The others must soon follow,
in the course of things.

204
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,275
I know they must.

205
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,353
I confess I feel this news is not calculated
to improve her happiness,

206
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,189
but perhaps I underestimate her.

207
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,839
Then it is not... Miss Eugenia Alabaster
who is to be married?

208
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,678
Oh, no.

209
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,997
<i>I was about to say "Oh, no, alas. "</i>

210
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,635
It is Rowena
who is to marry Mr Swinnerton.

211
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,355
Well, she's so beautiful, sir,
so very beautiful, and...

212
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,797
well, perfect...

213
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,118
that she cannot be long
without finding some worthy partner.

214
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,708
So I believe.

215
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,035
But her mother is concerned.

216
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,790
She will not be pleased
if Rowena goes first. It is not right.

217
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,835
<i>Please, I beg you.</i>

218
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,876
Please, I cannot.

219
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,954
I couldn't help noticing
you were in distress.

220
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,915
Can I be of help?
I will do anything to help if I can.

221
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,795
You're very kind. But I cannot be helped.

222
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,036
I am beyond help.

223
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,071
I wish I were dead, to speak truly.

224
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,156
I wish I were dead.

225
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,236
I ought to be dead.

226
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,513
I ought to be dead... as Harry is dead.

227
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,109
I know about your tragedy,
Miss Alabaster. I'm very sorry.

228
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,879
I hope you may be comforted.

229
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,390
Oh, I don't think you do know. Not at all.

230
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,675
No one can.

231
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,631
Well, that must be so.

232
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,673
You've shown great courage.
Please, don't be unhappy.

233
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,634
So many people love you,
you cannot be unhappy.

234
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,918
It is you who are good and kind.

235
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,270
And brave.

236
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,631
Even though you don't understand.

237
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,117
You've been kind to everyone,
even the little girls.

238
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,759
We are lucky to have you here.

239
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,959
And I would feel lucky, and honoured,

240
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,076
if you would feel you could let me be your
friend, despite the differences between us.

241
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,839
If you could trust me a little...

242
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,112
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Why should you trust me?

243
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,516
I want so much to do something for you.
Anything at all.

244
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,189
I own nothing, as you know,
so it's all folly.

245
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,630
But please, command me
if I can help in the least way ever.

246
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,956
Miss Alabaster?

247
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,716
Miss Alabaster?

248
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,915
So? What is it?

249
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,952
I have something to show you.

250
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,678
You'll have to come in quickly, now.

251
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,231
Am I safe?

252
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,351
You'll be quite safe.

253
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,359
They take your dress for the sky itself.

254
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,514
You don't find them disagreeable?

255
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,153
Oh, no.

256
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,239
They are... so light, so soft.

257
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,429
Like coloured air.

258
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,154
It's almost a cloud.

259
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,916
<i>It is a cloud.</i>

260
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,191
You are a miracle-worker.

261
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,116
Well, it's for you.

262
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,439
I have nothing real to give.

263
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,189
No pearls, no emeralds. I have nothing.

264
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,429
But I wanted so much
to give you something.

265
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,274
They are so terribly fragile.

266
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,077
You could hurt them just by touching.

267
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,909
One careless pinch would be enough.

268
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,039
I would never hurt one of those. Never.

269
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,590
How can I thank you?

270
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,550
You've already done so
with your appreciation.

271
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,559
Would you come back again this evening?

272
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,189
Yes.

273
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,229
Your moths are trying to perform suttee.

274
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,790
I don't know why they're so driven
to make burned offerings of themselves.

275
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,275
I've wondered
if they navigate by moonlight

276
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,394
and mistake our candles
for very bright heavenly bodies.

277
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,275
Won't you sit down? And see
if the moths think you are the moon?

278
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,030
As the butterflies took you
for the flowers and the sky.

279
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,638
- What is that?
- It's a newly hatched hawk moth.

280
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,194
A female.

281
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,030
In a little time, when she's strong,
I'll take away the cage and release her.

282
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,469
She seems very weak.

283
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,431
Aye.

284
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,711
Takes a great deal of force
to break out of the pupa.

285
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,594
Insects are at their most vulnerable
at the moment of metamorphosis.

286
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,076
They can easily be snapped up
by any predator.

287
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,954
- There are none here, I hope.
- Oh, no.

288
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,832
Good.

289
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,038
How lovely it is in the moonlight.

290
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,714
This is what I promised myself
for making you a cloud of butterflies.

291
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,076
Don't answer this, and don't feel
that I speak to alarm you.

292
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,275
I only want to say that you cannot know
how much these moments mean to me.

293
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,713
I shall remember them always.

294
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,195
Your closeness, your calm...

295
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,272
If things were only different,
I might say quite different things to you.

296
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,278
But I know how the land lies.

297
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,313
I've no hopes, except perhaps to be able
to speak briefly and honestly to you,

298
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,715
for I do not see how that could hurt you.

299
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,193
Oh...

300
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,236
Oh, take them away.

301
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,438
I don't like these!

302
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,519
They're male hawk moths, drawn
by the female in some mysterious way.

303
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,790
- Get them away.
- They're harmless.

304
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,515
- Get them away!
- There's no reason to fear them.

305
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,596
Please...

306
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,277
I'll carry her to the other end
of the conservatory.

307
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,515
- Now they'll follow her and leave you.
- There is another, trapped here!

308
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,949
Quickly. I shall scream.

309
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,196
- Please... Please...
- Must be the scent.

310
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,474
Oh, that was terrible. That was terrible.

311
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,672
It was like bats. Like ghosts.

312
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,155
- It was foul.
- Shh...

313
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,118
I didn't mean to frighten you.

314
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,879
My dear. I didn't mean to...

315
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,396
It isn't you.

316
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,476
It is everything.

317
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,630
I'm so unhappy.

318
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,358
Is it because of Captain Hunt?
Do you still grieve for him so?

319
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,433
He didn't want to marry me.

320
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,711
He died because
he didn't want to marry me.

321
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,316
That must be nonsense.
Anyone would want to marry you.

322
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,878
It wasn't really an accident, you know.
That is only what they say.

323
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,796
He did it because...

324
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,953
because he didn't want to marry me.

325
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,360
- Why didn't he?
- How should I know? Only it is so.

326
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,948
It is just clear to me that he didn't...

327
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,753
You torture me saying this.

328
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,791
My dearest wish in the world,
as you must know...

329
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,475
would be to be able
to ask you to be my wife.

330
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,958
Which I can never do, because
I cannot support a wife, or even myself.

331
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,036
I do know that.

332
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,556
But it's unbearably painful to me
to hear you speaking like this

333
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,513
and not be able myself...

334
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,552
I do not need to marry a fortune.

335
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,356
I have one of my own.

336
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,471
What are you saying?

337
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,272
There could be a double wedding.

338
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,957
I should not be married after Rowena.

339
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,837
Not... not if I am to be married at all.

340
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,079
Shall I speak to your father? Tomorrow?

341
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,113
Yes.

342
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,358
Arms up, please, Alice. Arms up.

343
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,349
Then, with all the wagers on,

344
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,349
I drove the gig
through narrow gaps in seven hedges.

345
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,712
And only one wheel fell off,
and that was right at the very end.

346
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,035
And the horse wanted to go on.

347
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,950
But with all the fences behind us,
there was no further point.

348
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,154
You, sir, must not have the nerve
or the strength to do such a thing.

349
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,273
You sit there and you smile fatuously,
but you could not bring such a thing off.

350
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,868
No doubt I could not.

351
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,278
I don't like your attitude, sir.
I have never liked it.

352
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,597
I believe you sneer in your heart.

353
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,280
I do not mean to sneer.

354
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,556
Since we are to be brothers, I hope
I would not give such an appearance.

355
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,875
"Brothers", you say?

356
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,150
I don't like that.

357
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,910
You are underbred, sir,
and you are no good match for my sister.

358
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,998
There is bad blood in you, vulgar blood.

359
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,352
I do not accept either "bad" or "vulgar".

360
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,838
I am aware that I'm no good match, and
that I have few prospects and no future.

361
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,635
Your father and Eugenia have done me
the kindness of overlooking that,

362
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,433
and I hope you may come
to accept their decision.

363
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,236
You should rather wish to fight me.
I insulted you.

364
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,797
You are a miserable creature
without breeding or courage.

365
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,957
You should stand up, sir, and face me.

366
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,916
I think not.

367
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,753
As for breeding, I count my father
as a kind man, an honest man,

368
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,235
and I know no other
good reason for respect.

369
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,956
As for courage, I think I may claim that to
have lived for ten years on the Amazons,

370
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,117
to have survived murder plots,
snakes, shipwreck,

371
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,834
15 days on a lifeboat in the mid-Atlantic,

372
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,954
reasonably compares with driving a poor
horse into a house through a window.

373
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,275
I think I know what true courage is.

374
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,109
It does not consist in fisticuffs
as a response to an insult.

375
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,119
Well said, William Adamson.
Well said, my fellow bridegroom.

376
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,834
You shall not have her! Do you hear?

377
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,916
She is not for such as you.

378
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,555
Please do not breathe in my face.
You resemble an angry dragon.

379
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,636
Stand up.

380
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,518
You shall not provoke me into disgracing
a house and a family I hope to belong to.

381
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,073
Stand up.

382
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,670
In the Amazons, young men
who make themselves stupid with spirits

383
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,030
often kill each other inadvertently.

384
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,071
I should not care if you were killed.

385
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,638
Eugenia might care very deeply if I were.
She's already lost one hus...

386
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,951
I beg you not to...
make too much of Edgar.

387
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,474
He is wild in his cups
and he is quiet after.

388
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,192
He often does not remember
what has passed.

389
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,278
It was the drink insulted you.

390
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,710
I'm happy to accept such an explanation.

391
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,308
Good man, fellow bridegroom.

392
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,396
Civilised man.

393
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,069
We are not armed warriors now, are we?

394
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,557
Civilised men who stay seated
as we should, we are.

395
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,596
I admire you, William.

396
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,190
Edgar is... an anachronism.

397
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,353
You didn't think I knew that word,
I'll be bound.

398
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,914
On the contrary.

399
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,554
Thank you for your kindness.

400
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,110
William.

401
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,037
We are both men of the outdoors.
We have that in common, do we not?

402
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,270
We do.

403
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,793
And I hope that in time we may come
to find other common interests.

404
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,514
Indeed. I'm sure we will.

405
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,435
Good night, Edgar.

406
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,755
Good night, William.

407
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,392
A present from Miss Eugenia, sir.

408
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,996
Well?

409
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,154
Here I am. You see?

410
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,471
Here we are.

411
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,955
I cannot believe my own happiness.

412
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,638
Well, you will catch cold if you cannot
believe it enough to come in.

413
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,350
I've loved you
from the first moment that I saw you.

414
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,155
I don't want to hurt you.

415
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,595
Oh, you're honey.

416
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,196
Sweet as honey.

417
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,874
<i>We're going to be
so happy together.</i>

418
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,995
- Good morning.
- Morning.

419
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,200
- Hope I don't disturb you.
- By no means.

420
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,598
I'm conducting experiments.
You'll no doubt find my researches crude.

421
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,793
On the contrary.
What is it that you're studying?

422
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,676
I've been placing various foods upon
the surface of the earth in the tank,

423
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,989
counting the ants who avail themselves
of the food, and how they dispose of it.

424
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,196
And look.

425
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,275
They are greatly attracted
to fragments of grape and melon.

426
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,870
It's taken half an hour
for this scrap of sweet fruit

427
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,912
to become no more
than a living pincushion.

428
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,555
You cannot but admire
the spirit of cooperation.

429
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:18,630
<i>I hope my Formica prima hasn't drowned.
She hasn't stirred for quite ten minutes.</i>

430
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,957
You're at the point
of recognising individual ants?

431
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,116
May I see your book?

432
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,196
You put me to shame, Miss Crompton.

433
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,196
I've been secretly worrying about the
cutting short of my hoped-for researches

434
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,153
into the insect life in the Amazon basin.

435
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,271
My present good fortune...

436
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,552
And here you are,
doing what I should be doing:

437
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,831
Observing the unknown world
which is to hand.

438
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:22,115
My sphere is naturally more limited.
I... naturally look closer to hand.

439
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,790
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Arthur.

440
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,511
I believe we can expect a happy event.

441
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,314
I believe I am with child.

442
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,158
Congratulations, my dear.
Congratulations.

443
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,396
That's wonderful news.

444
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,352
Yes, you look quite different.
A new creature.

445
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,075
You look wonderfully mysterious.

446
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:04,357
I... am a little peaked.
I do not quite feel myself.

447
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,792
I am somewhat nauseous.
No doubt quite naturally.

448
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,559
Poor Eugenia. It's so hot.

449
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:29,438
I must confess, I'm quite uncomfortable.
I shall be until the baby arrives.

450
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,238
Oh...

451
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,798
I don't like these ants.
Please, have them go away!

452
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:01,516
<i>I think the Formica fusca have chosen
today for their annual nuptial dance.</i>

453
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:49,399
<i>Like cygnets. You're like
swan's-down and they're like cygnets.</i>

454
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,757
They do not seem to resemble me at all.

455
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,508
They will, you know.

456
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,475
I've seen ever so many babies,
and they change from week to week.

457
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,068
Even from day to day.

458
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,796
Resemblances run across
their little faces like clouds.

459
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,597
Papa today, Grandpapa tomorrow,
Aunt Ponsonby on Tuesday,

460
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,315
and Great-grandmama
at Friday dinnertime.

461
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,955
It's because they're so soft, the dears.

462
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,150
So plastic.

463
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,072
You'll suddenly see
your own chin on Agnes.

464
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:37,513
And one or other of your grandmothers
smiling out of Dora's eyes.

465
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,475
I'm sure you're right.

466
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,151
What are you doing?

467
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,556
When I come down,
the scullery's arun with creatures, sir.

468
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,194
I have to set traps at night.

469
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,029
You put molasses in a tin
and they fall in and can't right themselves.

470
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,720
Then I have to pour boiling water on them.

471
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,435
You'd be amazed how quick they
come back, no matter how many you kill.

472
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,790
I hate the smell.

473
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,116
I beg your pardon.

474
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,957
And an eight.

475
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:10,073
A little cherub.
Yes, that's exactly what you are.

476
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,909
A beautiful baby. Yes, you are.

477
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,996
My turn?

478
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,790
Thank you, Nurse.

479
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,156
A six.

480
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,473
Can't we keep them down? I should
so like to hold them a little longer.

481
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,797
Rowena dear, there is tomorrow too.

482
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,718
Nurse has to feed
and ready them for bed now.

483
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,999
I so rarely hold a baby.

484
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,431
My dear Rowena.

485
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,590
Your turn, Rowena.

486
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,078
Rowena...

487
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,320
Eugenia, please, let me go to her.
I think it would be better.

488
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,038
Yes.

489
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,594
You and William are so blessed.

490
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,596
Two beautiful children,
and another expected.

491
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,598
It is very hard for Rowena.

492
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,874
You are so blessed.

493
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,474
It was incredible. The people in the train
waved and cheered as we overtook them.

494
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,750
And we went on for a good three miles.

495
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,997
But for the river,
we could have gone on for longer.

496
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:39,148
No, there's no future in locomotives.
Give me a purebred Arab stallion any day.

497
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,636
For speed and strength,
the Arab is unmatched.

498
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,276
No, there is no substitute
for pure blood, Robin.

499
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,191
Keep the breeds separate and you can't
go far wrong - that is the cardinal rule.

500
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:58,474
God made creatures distinct.
It is our job to keep them that way.

501
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,636
Am I not right?

502
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,672
Well, a breed, like a dialect of language,

503
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,155
can hardly be said
to have a distinct origin.

504
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,273
Indeed, the evidence is that all horses
descended from the same animal.

505
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,960
<i>And if you look at the breed...</i>

506
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,518
Don't be absurd. A drayhorse
has nothing in common with an Arab.

507
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,838
There is no blood shared there.
They're different, quite different.

508
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,191
And if you knew horses, you'd see that.

509
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,276
It is hard to believe, I agree.

510
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,631
However, you do not need
to take my word for it. There's...

511
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,788
<i>Mr Darwin makes his argument very clear
in The Origin of Species,</i>

512
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:45,916
as you would know if you ever took any
interest in the important ideas of our time.

513
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:52,434
Indeed, we need look no further
than our own flock of small black sheep

514
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,951
to see that careful breeding with
our own flock and that of our neighbours

515
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,674
has produced an entirely new breed.

516
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,677
Father...

517
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,398
Think, Edgar, before you speak.

518
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,550
The boy's name must be... Edgar.

519
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,552
Why?

520
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,913
Why? There is an Edgar
in every generation of Alabasters.

521
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,510
My son is not an Alabaster,
my son's an Adamson.

522
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,760
And I wish to give my child a name from
my own family, however undistinguished.

523
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:05,672
I do not see why. We do not see your
family or speak, or seem likely to do so.

524
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:11,352
Your family does not come here,
and Edgar will not know them, I suppose.

525
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:16,679
<i>We are your family. And I think
you must own we have been good to you.</i>

526
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,837
More than good, my dear,
more than good.

527
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,269
- Only I...
- Only?

528
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:29,992
Well, I wish to have something of my own.
And my son is my own, in some sense.

529
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,755
We could call him William Edgar.

530
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,990
Not my name, my father's. Robert.

531
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,959
Robert's a good English name.

532
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,914
Robert Edgar.

533
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,356
<i>Abraham!</i>

534
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,835
Methuselah!

535
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,554
<i>I am that I am.</i>

536
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,911
- Moses.
- "I am. "

537
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,751
Am! Am!

538
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,108
Oh!

539
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,557
Lesson.

540
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,756
Apple?

541
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,751
Bee.

542
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,916
- What's that?
- A crocodile!

543
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,395
No, no - alphabet lesson.

544
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,830
A.

545
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,712
You're so clever.

546
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,071
Belt.

547
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,229
Girdle.

548
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,999
No, zone.

549
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,590
- Oh, well done, Miss Mead.
- Miss Mead.

550
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,753
Am-a-zon!

551
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,950
It's very strange.

552
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,278
When I was in the Amazons, I'd wake daily
from a dream of mild English sunshine,

553
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,358
of simple and wonderful things
such as bread and butter

554
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,552
instead of endless cassava.

555
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:51,314
Now I wake from dreams of the forest
curtain, the movement of the river...

556
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,720
and my work.

557
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,469
You work, I believe,
with Sir Harald on his book.

558
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,797
I do, but I'm not really needed.

559
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,036
And my views...

560
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,152
In short, my views
do not wholly agree with his.

561
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,510
Perhaps you should write your own book.

562
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,757
No, no, no.
I have no settled opinions to advance,

563
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,908
and no wish to convert anyone to my own
rather uncertain views on things.

564
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,637
I did not mean opinions.
I meant a book of facts.

565
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:32,278
A book of scientific facts, such as
you are uniquely qualified to write.

566
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,279
Well, I have thought about
writing a book about my travels.

567
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,039
Such books are very successful, I know,

568
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:44,871
but all my detailed notes, all
my specimens... all lost in the shipwreck.

569
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,833
I've not the heart to invent, even if I could.

570
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,033
But nearer to hand lie things
you could observe and write about.

571
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,116
Yes, yes.

572
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,479
You've said this before.
I'm certain you're right.

573
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:04,755
But a detailed scientific study would take
many years, much rigour, and I'd hoped...

574
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,836
You'd hoped?

575
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,152
I had hoped to set out again
on a foreign journey

576
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,990
to collect more information
about the untravelled world.

577
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,475
I wish to do that.

578
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,149
Sir Harald has suggested
that he might be sympathetic.

579
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,989
The book I should like to see you write
is not a major scientific study,

580
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,680
not the work of a lifetime.

581
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,911
It's a book I think may prove useful
and I daresay profitable to you

582
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,996
in the quite near future.

583
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,591
I think, if you were to write a natural
history of the ant colonies over a year,

584
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:50,592
you would have something interesting
to the public, and yet of scientific value.

585
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,869
It might be interesting.

586
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,956
- It might be fun.
- Fun.

587
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,152
The children could be employed,
I'd be proud to assist,

588
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,714
Miss Mead would do what she could...

589
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,434
I see the children
as characters in the drama -

590
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,109
there has to be a drama
if the book is to appeal to the public.

591
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,471
Why don't you write it yourself?
It's your idea.

592
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,194
No, no. I have not
the requisite knowledge.

593
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,198
Nor the time.
Though I don't know where my days go.

594
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,438
No, I don't see myself as a writer,
but as an assistant, Mr Adamson.

595
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,074
If you would accept me
I would be honoured.

596
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,351
I can draw, I can write,
I can copy if necessary.

597
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,476
I'm extraordinarily grateful to you,
Miss Crompton.

598
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,319
I do believe
you've transfigured my prospects.

599
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,078
Hardly.

600
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,193
But it may be the answer.
With good will and hard work.

601
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,316
What name shall we give to the home
of the blood-red slave-makers?

602
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,431
It is a horrible trade.

603
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,109
<i>Never have I wept so over a book
as I wept over Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>

604
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,152
I pray nightly for the cause
of President Lincoln.

605
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,159
<i>We could call the nest
Bredely Hall. We have lots of servants.</i>

606
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,033
<i>That wouldn't be appropriate, Margaret.</i>

607
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:19,154
<i>I propose Red Fort. It's warlike
and brings in the colour of the sanguinea.</i>

608
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,909
- Yes, that's appropriate.
- Red Fort, yes.

609
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,875
<i>"In the spring of 1862,
we began the organised ant-watch. "</i>

610
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,518
<i>"The colony was busily preparing
for the breeding season. "</i>

611
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,789
<i>"As the red ants set about their task,
we set about ours,</i>

612
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,037
<i>observing and recording
the colony at work. "</i>

613
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,473
<i>"On our first sentry duty, Edith noticed
scuttling worker ants cleaning their nest,</i>

614
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,275
<i>much as human beings
spring-clean their houses. "</i>

615
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,755
<i>"Margaret, Elaine and Miss Crompton</i>

616
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,396
<i>carefully mapped out the city
and its satellite suburbs. "</i>

617
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,476
<i>"There were numerous entrances,</i>

618
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,910
<i>with well-worn paths
winding across the forest floor. "</i>

619
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,350
<i>"The girls illustrated the scene
with a column of worker ants</i>

620
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,950
<i>setting forth on a foraging expedition. "</i>

621
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,715
<i>"Miss Crompton's
evening watches revealed</i>

622
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,196
<i>that the city was never defenceless
against outsiders. "</i>

623
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:24,111
<i>"Night-time guards were posted behind
gates barricaded with twigs and leaves. "</i>

624
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,834
<i>"Not all outsiders were unwelcome. "</i>

625
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,669
<i>"With patient observation,
and the help of Miss Mead's umbrella,</i>

626
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,997
<i>we uncovered
a thriving population of Nitidulidae. "</i>

627
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,157
<i>"These small beetles live
on the fringes of the city,</i>

628
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,431
<i>scavenging after the ants' leftovers. "</i>

629
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,876
<i>"As the weeks passed, we came to
understand the ants' activities in Red Fort</i>

630
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,993
<i>as well as any man would know
the comings and goings of his own house,</i>

631
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,475
<i>if not better. "</i>

632
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,272
Oh, there you are.

633
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:03,030
<i>I recruited Amy to keep an eye on the nest
of the fusca ants on her afternoons off.</i>

634
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,869
I'm certain your assistance
will prove extremely useful, Amy.

635
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,115
Thank you, sir.

636
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:14,270
Go and join Tom now. Miss Mead and
the girls will be here to relieve you later.

637
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,349
It'll do her good to get a bit of fresh air,

638
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,600
having no family and nowhere to go,
and earn a few extra pennies.

639
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,713
What would you say to a few
cartoon-like illustrations to your text?

640
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,631
Here I've drawn one with a stiletto,
and here a helmet and a heavy wrench.

641
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,993
I should think it might add greatly
to the human interest.

642
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,950
Goodbye. Enjoy the hunt.

643
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,150
We will.

644
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,158
<i>William? Is that you?</i>

645
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,791
William?

646
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,633
It is you. I could tell by your step.

647
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,790
Are you tired, dear?

648
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,476
Somewhat.

649
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,235
I am stiff from a day in the saddle.

650
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:59,071
But, my dear, it was wonderful to be out
with the hunt again after my confinement.

651
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,995
I do love it so.

652
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,994
You look beautiful, my dear.

653
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,076
Really?

654
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,719
As beautiful as ever?

655
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,834
More beautiful than ever.

656
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,713
<i>The world has changed
so much, William, in my lifetime.</i>

657
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,110
I am old enough to have believed
in the first parents in paradise.

658
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:23,836
As a little boy, to have believed
in Satan hidden in the serpent

659
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,875
and the archangel,
with his flaming sword, closing the gate.

660
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:35,269
And now I am supposed to believe
in a world in which we are what we are

661
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:42,476
because of the mutations
of soft jelly and calceous bone

662
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:48,072
which goes on and on and on
through unimaginable millennia.

663
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,552
A world in which angels and devils
do not do battle in heaven,

664
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:01,233
but in which we eat and are eaten and
are absorbed into other flesh and blood.

665
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:06,559
I shall moulder like a mushroom
when my time comes.

666
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,592
And it will be soon.

667
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:15,158
I shall end my life like a skeleton leaf
about to be humus,

668
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,959
a mouse clutched by an owl,

669
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:25,677
a bull calf going to the slaughter through
a gate which leads only to one way -

670
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:30,271
to blood and dust and destruction.

671
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:38,639
And then I think:
No brute beast would think such things.

672
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:46,758
No frog, no hound even, would have
such a vision of the angel of Annunciation.

673
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,599
Where does it all come from?

674
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,396
Come quick! Come quick!

675
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,636
- Do come!
- What's the matter, Amy?

676
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,797
Tom says the ants
are coming up in a fizzing great army!

677
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,388
He says come quick, something's up.

678
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:09,150
I saw them myself.
They're like gravy boiling. Do come.

679
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,597
<i>"The great slaving raid
took place on a hot afternoon</i>

680
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:24,554
<i>after several days of frantic activity
within Red Fort. "</i>

681
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,639
<i>"We arrived at the nest to see gossiping
and seething crowds of red ants</i>

682
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,992
<i>massing for a clearly important event -
we knew not what. "</i>

683
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,911
<i>"And then, at some sign, the ants
swarmed out of the city from every exit. "</i>

684
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,353
<i>"Was it a little Napoleon
who led the call to arms,</i>

685
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,439
<i>or had the heat of the sun alone
signalled the ants to act in unison?"</i>

686
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,989
<i>"We followed as the army set out
across the forest floor. "</i>

687
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,192
<i>"The rough terrain of twigs and leaves
separated the well-organised ranks</i>

688
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,869
<i>into seemingly raggle-taggle brigades. "</i>

689
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,828
<i>"15 yards from their own citadel,
the red ants stopped, regrouped,</i>

690
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,671
<i>then descended upon an unsuspecting
nest of black ants, the Formica fusca. "</i>

691
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,552
<i>"The black ants sallied forth bravely
to beat off the thieves and kidnappers. "</i>

692
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,240
<i>"Waving their antennae,
hurrying furiously,</i>

693
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,989
<i>they bit at the legs and heads and feelers
of the busy bloody ants. "</i>

694
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,270
<i>"They attempted,
sometimes with success,</i>

695
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,278
<i>to grasp the red invaders
and bite them to death. "</i>

696
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,789
<i>"The red ants had one purpose only:</i>

697
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,639
<i>To snatch the unhatched
black ants from the nest</i>

698
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,435
<i>and carry them
in their fine jaws to Red Fort. "</i>

699
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:48,990
<i>"From that moment on, the fate of the
captured black-ant nestlings was sealed. "</i>

700
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,999
<i>"They would live and die as red ants,
not as true black ants. "</i>

701
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,032
<i>"They would feed and nourish
little blood-red ants,</i>

702
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,037
<i>and in time respond to the sun</i>

703
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:02,039
<i>by massing to attack
their forgotten families. "</i>

704
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:08,997
<i>"It is as if environment were everything,
and inheritance nothing. "</i>

705
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,911
Amy?

706
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,276
I didn't know you had an interest
in this little thing.

707
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,439
I don't, not a personal one.
But in her general wellbeing.

708
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,278
Ah.

709
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,991
Her general wellbeing.

710
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,839
Tell him, Amy, was I hurting you?

711
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,835
Were my attentions unwelcome, perhaps?

712
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,757
No. No, sir.

713
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,111
I'm quite all right, Mr Adamson. Please.

714
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,118
I think you should apologise, sir,
and leave us.

715
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,276
I think Amy should run on.
I think she'd do best to run on.

716
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,992
Sir?

717
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,716
Run off, then, child.

718
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,037
I can always find you if I want you.

719
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:39,949
The servants in this house
are none of your concern, Mr Adamson.

720
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,477
You do not pay their wages, and
I'll thank you not to interfere with them.

721
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,230
That little creature's no more than a child.
One who's not had a proper childhood.

722
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,956
Nonsense.
She's a nice little packet of flesh.

723
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,879
And her heart beats faster
when I reach for it.

724
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,152
And her little mouth
opens sweetly and eagerly.

725
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,116
You know nothing, Adamson.

726
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,270
I've noticed that you know nothing.

727
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,791
Go back to your beetles
and your creepy-crawlies.

728
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,879
I won't hurt the little puss,
you can believe.

729
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,878
Just add a little bit of natural spice.

730
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,199
Anyway, it's none of your business.
You're a hanger-on.

731
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:35,677
<i>And I've yet to learn what use you are
to the world or anyone in it.</i>

732
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,793
I told you,
I've noticed that you know nothing.

733
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,510
<i>"And what of the fusca ant males?"</i>

734
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,589
"Their fate exemplifies the remorseless
random purposefulness of Dame Nature,

735
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,676
of natural selection. "

736
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,920
"They exist only for the nuptial dance
and the fertilisation of the queens. "

737
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,032
"They are flying amorous projectiles,

738
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:16,631
truly no more than the burning arrows of
the winged and blindfold god of love. "

739
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:23,074
"And after their day of glory,
they're unnecessary and unwanted. "

740
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,159
"They run hither and thither aimlessly,
draggle-winged. "

741
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,829
"They are beaten back, for the most part,
from their home nests,

742
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,916
and driven away to mope and die

743
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:37,909
in the cooling evenings
of the late summer and early autumn. "

744
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,751
Very eloquent.

745
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,714
I'm quite overcome with pity
for these poor, useless male creatures.

746
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,992
I must admit,
I'd never seen them in that light before.

747
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,874
Do you not think you may have been
somewhat anthropomorphic

748
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,389
in your choice of rhetoric?

749
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,832
I thought that was our intention, to appeal
to a wide audience by telling truths -

750
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,192
scientific truths,
but with a note of the fabulous.

751
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,755
Perhaps I've overdone it.
I could tone it down.

752
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,759
I'm quite sure you should not.
It will do excellently as it is.

753
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,759
It will appeal greatly
to the dramatic emotions.

754
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,238
The book is to be delightful
as well as profound and truthful, is it not?

755
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,992
I've been making a collection
of literary citations

756
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,669
which I thought you might place
at the head of your chapters.

757
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,554
I found a wonderful sonnet,
by poor mad John Clare,

758
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:41,949
which suggests that our ideas of fairies
are only anthropomorphising of insects.

759
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:46,119
And I've had an idea to put my little
drawings of fairy insects into a book.

760
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,470
A book?

761
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,034
I'm amazed at your accomplishments.

762
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,118
Latin, Greek,
draughtsmanship of a high quality,

763
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,391
a thorough knowledge
of English literature...

764
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,354
I was educated with my betters
in the schoolroom of a bishop.

765
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:06,474
My father was the tutor,
and the bishop's lady kindly intentioned.

766
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,956
- You should publish on your own behalf.
- No.

767
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,878
This is for my own entertainment.

768
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,878
The ants, you know, were my muse.

769
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,876
They inspired me.

770
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,154
I'll take it into town on the pretext
of looking for new winter boots.

771
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:06,991
I do not trust that village postmistress not
to tell everyone a fat packet has gone off.

772
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:12,319
We do not wish to attract attention to what
may be a fruitless endeavour, do we?

773
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:16,877
No, when the book is handsomely bound
and ready for review,

774
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,309
then we shall be open.

775
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,637
This cushion here. That's better.

776
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,230
Can I have a drink?

777
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,038
Mother?

778
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,276
Mother!

779
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,633
No.

780
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,874
No... No...

781
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,556
Oh, Mother...

782
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,076
Mother!

783
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,878
No...

784
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,916
There.

785
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,352
No.

786
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,871
Good.

787
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,639
"Dear Mr Adamson,
you are to be heartily congratulated

788
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,513
upon your ingenious natural history,

789
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,599
just the kind of book of which
the world of letters cannot have enough. "

790
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,188
"We are happy you have
chosen us as its publishers

791
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,952
and hope we may come to a happy
arrangement for a fruitful partnership. "

792
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:34,959
- I knew it, but I was so afraid.
- I can hardly believe it.

793
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,471
We must not be over-sanguine. I have no
idea of the profit from a successful book.

794
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,556
Nor I, nor I.

795
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,350
I hardly like to mention it to Sir Harald.

796
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,119
He's in a very bad way
with his own project.

797
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,518
He's torn up several sheaves
of writing only yesterday.

798
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,433
I don't feel I've given him
the support he needs.

799
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,596
Oh, I understand.

800
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,515
Perhaps it's not certain enough to reveal.
Perhaps we should keep our own counsel.

801
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,234
I'm quite happy to go on as we are.

802
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:13,592
The shock - the surprise, I should say -
will be all the more complete

803
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:17,759
when we come to reveal
what has been in the making.

804
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:33,595
Mr William, I can tell you now that you are
the father of not one, but two infant girls.

805
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,393
Both living, both doing well.

806
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,914
Hounds, gentlemen, please.

807
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,195
- Mr Adamson!
- Whoa, whoa.

808
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,474
Mr Adamson, sir. You have
to come back to Miss Eugenia. Please.

809
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,158
Is she ill?

810
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,272
Couldn't say, sir.
You has to come back to Miss Eugenia.

811
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,273
- Is my wife well?
- I think so, sir.

812
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,875
- Do you know where she is?
- In her room, sir, I think.

813
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,879
She told me she was
not to be disturbed until after dinner.

814
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,312
Oh!

815
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,112
Get dressed.

816
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,556
Get dressed.

817
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,831
And go. Go now.

818
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:10,398
Take those, take them in your hand,
and anything else, and leave.

819
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,960
I told you to go now!

820
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,076
You too, dress yourself.

821
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,950
Cover up now. Just cover up.

822
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,318
- William...
- Dress yourself.

823
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,396
Just dress yourself.

824
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,035
Dress yourself!

825
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,079
It's like a whorehouse.

826
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,036
It's disgusting.

827
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,395
You are disgusting.

828
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,397
I can't put this on without Martha.

829
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,716
Will you help me?

830
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,070
I shan't touch you.

831
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:07,436
Why don't you just cover yourself?
You're horrible to see!

832
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,476
Hurry up!

833
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,832
This...

834
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,992
This has been going on
for some time, hasn't it?

835
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,672
Has it? All the time I've been here?

836
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,911
Yes.

837
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,476
How long?

838
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,074
Since I was very little.

839
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,710
Very little, yes.

840
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,960
You cannot possibly understand.

841
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,275
No, I cannot.

842
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:14,149
At first... it seemed nothing to do
with the rest of my life.

843
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:20,359
<i>It was just something secret...
that was, you know?</i>

844
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,629
Like other things you must not do, and do.

845
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,758
Like touching yourself in the dark.

846
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,231
You don't understand.

847
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:43,310
And then when I was going to marry
Captain Hunt... he saw. He saw.

848
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,598
<i>Not so much as you have seen,
but enough to guess.</i>

849
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,950
And it preyed on his mind.

850
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,870
It preyed on his mind.

851
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,309
I swore then I would stop it.

852
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,432
And I did stop it. I did.

853
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:05,795
Because I wanted to be married
and good and... like other people.

854
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,879
And I did persuade him
that he was mistaken in me.

855
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,313
It was so hard, for he...
he could not say what he feared.

856
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,874
He would not speak it out loud.

857
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:24,757
And that was when I saw
how very terrible it was.

858
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,236
<i>I was.</i>

859
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,353
Only we could not stop!

860
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,192
I don't think that... he meant even to stop.

861
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:42,234
You see, he's strong, William.

862
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:46,433
And, of course, Captain Hunt,
well, someone led him to see.

863
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,633
And he wrote a terrible letter to both of us.

864
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,910
He said...

865
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:57,670
oh, that he could not live
with the knowledge, even if we could.

866
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,109
That is what he said.

867
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,515
And then he shot himself.

868
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:07,079
In the desk there was a note to me
saying I would know why he had died,

869
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,988
and he hoped
that I would be able to be happy.

870
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,277
And even after that you just went right on.

871
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,790
Who else could I turn to?!

872
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:23,198
Well, you turned to me.
Or you made use of me, anyhow.

873
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,029
All the children will revert
so shockingly to the ancestral type.

874
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,752
- No!
- True little Alabasters.

875
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,713
No, no, no! I don't know! I don't know!

876
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,308
Well, I know, don't I!

877
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,910
It's perfectly obvious.
You just have to look at them.

878
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:48,672
I'll go now.

879
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,870
We can talk again later.

880
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,230
William. William.

881
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,556
What will you do?

882
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,514
I don't know what I shall do.

883
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,079
I shall tell you when I do know.

884
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,954
You need not be afraid
that I shall kill myself.

885
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,310
Or him.

886
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:16,194
I want to be a free man,
not a convicted murderer.

887
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:40,233
<i>Remember, William, the aim of the game
is to get rid of all your letters.</i>

888
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,316
Oh, yes.

889
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,960
<i>"Phoenix. "</i>

890
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:02,315
I only had this left.

891
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,951
No, not now. Later.

892
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,196
I'll find a time later.

893
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,110
Please, take a seat.

894
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,073
I hope you don't think
this is too conspiratorial.

895
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,633
No.

896
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,277
You wish to talk.

897
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,398
You sent me a word tonight.

898
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:18,670
And someone sent for me to come back to
the house today when I was not wanted.

899
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,109
When I was anything but wanted.

900
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:25,279
I didn't send for you,
if that's what you're thinking.

901
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:31,434
There are people in a house, you know,
who know everything that's going on.

902
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,437
Invisible people.

903
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:38,839
And now and then the house simply
decides that something must happen.

904
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,509
I think your message came to you
after a series of misunderstandings

905
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,949
that were at some level deliberate.

906
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,350
But you know what I saw?

907
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,399
Yes.

908
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:59,316
There are people in houses, between
the visible inhabitants and the invisible,

909
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,510
largely invisible to both,

910
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,599
who can know a very great deal
if they choose.

911
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:10,077
I choose to know about some things
and not about others.

912
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,752
I've become interested in knowing
about things that concern you.

913
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,630
I've been used. I've been made a fool of.

914
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,274
Even if that is so,
it's not the most important thing.

915
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,518
<i>What I want to know is what you feel.
I want to know what you're going to do.</i>

916
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:34,233
I find that... my most powerful feeling
is that I'm free.

917
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:42,430
I ought to feel shocked,
or vengeful, humiliated,

918
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,597
and I do feel all of these things
from time to time,

919
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,838
but mostly I feel... I can go now.

920
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:56,308
I can. I can leave this house.
I can return to my true work.

921
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,556
There was talk of equipping
a further Amazon venture.

922
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:05,595
No. I cannot now take
one Alabaster penny. You must see that.

923
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:08,678
You see everything, I begin to think.

924
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,714
I must go away, and soon.

925
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,195
And never return.

926
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,312
You are all that I shall miss here.

927
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:27,318
I've never felt anything, in my heart
of hearts, for all those white children.

928
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,668
This may be only of the moment.

929
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,952
No, no.

930
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,116
I can go. I shall go.

931
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:40,631
My book - our book - will provide
something. More can be earned.

932
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,396
<i>I have sold my book.</i>

933
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,718
<i>Your book?</i>

934
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:51,197
Yes. I told you I was preparing
a book of drawings and writings

935
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,598
integrating the insect realm
with fairy tales.

936
01:41:56,440 --> 01:42:00,069
When did you write it?
Why didn't you tell me?

937
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,150
I wrote it here.

938
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:09,910
I had to do it alone.
I had to do something that would be mine.

939
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,556
All my life I've worked for others,
for their good.

940
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:20,471
Everything I had, even this, could be taken
away from me on someone else's whim.

941
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,033
My book was my secret.

942
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,197
Just as now it's my gift.

943
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,194
I cannot... You were not offering...

944
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:34,552
I've taken certain steps -
entirely subject to your approval.

945
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:42,836
I have a banker's draft from Mr Murray,
the publisher, which will more than suffice

946
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,909
and a letter from Mr Stevens offering to
negotiate the sale of specimens as before,

947
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:52,238
and a letter from Captain Papagay, who
sails from Liverpool to Rio in a month.

948
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,430
He has two berths free.

949
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,516
You truly are a good fairy.

950
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:00,553
You wave your wand and I've all I desire
before I can think of desiring it.

951
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:04,559
I watch and contrive and write letters
and consider your nature,

952
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,990
and you do desire it - you've just said so.

953
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:09,872
<i>Two berths?</i>

954
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,872
I will come with you.

955
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,275
You've filled me with a desire.

956
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:22,110
I shall not rest until I've seen the great
river and felt the air of the Tropics.

957
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,991
You cannot do that.

958
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,033
Think of the fever,
think of the terrible biting creatures.

959
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,390
Of the monotonous, insufficient food.

960
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,273
Of the rough men out there,
the drunkenness.

961
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,470
<i>- Yet you will go there.
- I'm not a woman.</i>

962
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,831
- Oh, and I am.
- It's no place for a woman.

963
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:43,350
- There are women there.
- Yes, yes, but not of your kind.

964
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:47,155
I don't think you know
what kind of woman I am.

965
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,117
<i>I don't think you know that I am a woman.</i>

966
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,875
You never see me.
Why should that not continue as it is?

967
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,514
You have no idea who I am.

968
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:05,313
You have no idea even how old I am.

969
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,557
You think I may be of an age
between 30 and 50- confess it.

970
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:14,630
If you know so precisely what it is I think,
it's because you've meant me to think it.

971
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:22,433
All right, tell me, since you invite
the question. How old are you?

972
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,156
I'm 27.

973
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:34,600
I've one life, and 27 years of it
have passed, and I intend to begin living.

974
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:39,157
Not in the rainforest, not in the Amazons.
The place is very much an inferno.

975
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:43,353
- But you will go there.
- I know how to live that life.

976
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,199
I can learn. I'm strong, I'm resourceful.

977
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,710
I have not lived softly,
contrary to appearances.

978
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,274
You need not heed me
once the voyage is over.

979
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,436
- It's a daydream.
- It is what I will do!

980
01:44:54,560 --> 01:45:00,157
- Matty... Miss Crompton...
- Up here, at night, there is no Matty!

981
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,669
My name is Matilda.

982
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,671
Look at me.

983
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,309
I have looked at you.

984
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,194
I've seen your wrists, Matilda.

985
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,231
I only wanted you to see me.

986
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:53,830
I don't think that was all you wanted.

987
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,869
Shall I stay here?

988
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,671
Or shall I go back now?

989
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:13,190
I should like you to stay,
but it's not very comfortable here.

990
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,559
If we are to travel together...

991
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:24,508
you'll find that we look back on this...

992
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,190
as a paradise of comfort.

993
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:52,118
So, you have decided.
What is to be my fate?

994
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:56,869
I must confess,
I'm more interested in my own.

995
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:00,792
I've decided to leave you, Eugenia.

996
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,269
And... shall you speak to anyone?

997
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,911
Shall you... tell?

998
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,909
Who can I tell, Eugenia...

999
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:18,356
whom I should not destroy in the telling?

1000
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,519
You must live with yourself.
That's all I can say.

1001
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,994
You must live with yourself.

1002
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,830
I know it was bad.

1003
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,670
I know it was bad.

1004
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:40,156
But you must understand,
it didn't feel bad.

1005
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:44,910
Breeders know even first-cousin
marriages produce inherited defects.

1006
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,838
That is a cruel thing to say.

1007
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,755
<i>Morpho eugenia.</i>

1008
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,875
You are very lovely.

1009
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:12,153
It has not done me any good
to look pretty.

1010
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,316
To be admired.

1011
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,229
I would like to be different.

1012
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,389
Goodbye, Eugenia.

1013
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,750
I shall not return.
