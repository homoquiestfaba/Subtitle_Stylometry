1
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,645
The tale of the Harimaya Bridge.

2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,473
Do you know it?

3
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:30,277
Everybody in Kochi knows that one, honey.

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:35,324
We sing about it during the Yosakoi dance.

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:48,881
# At the Harimaya Bridge,
in Kochi, in Tosa... #

6
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,714
Hello.

7
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,586
Oh, let me take your bag for you.

8
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,459
This one, then.

9
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,799
This way, please.

10
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,495
Look, spare us the song!
This isn't a karaoke bar.

11
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,082
May I take your order?

12
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,215
Yes, he'll have nabeyaki udon.

13
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,092
Zaru-soba.

14
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,139
The hamburger combo.

15
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,267
And I'll have tsukimi udon.

16
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,978
Yes, I understand.
Will that be all for you?

17
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,234
- Yes.
- Coming right up.

18
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,281
This way!

19
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,989
I'll show him how to use this.

20
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:52,032
" Like father, like son"
doesn't apply here, huh?

21
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:56,244
He just landed. He probably
feels awkward right now.

22
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,126
Awkward doesn't equal rude.

23
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,662
Here.

24
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,886
" Education Office"

25
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,401
- I'm back.
- Thanks.

26
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:30,409
Daniel-san wants to take
the paintings Mickey-sensei gave to us.

27
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:28,752
Daniel-san wants to know
where Kubo-sensei is.

28
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,597
Well...

29
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,224
I spoke to her father
not long after she quit.

30
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:45,685
He said she moved away,
but he didn't say why or where.

31
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,008
He wants us to call her parents,

32
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,838
because they might have
Mickey-sensei's paintings.

33
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:28,820
Well... it might not
do any good, but I'll try anyway.

34
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,864
Okay, see you later.

35
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,993
Hara-sensei!

36
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,253
Can you take these reports with you, too?

37
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,922
Sure.

38
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,304
Principal, they're here.

39
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:35,357
Ah, here they are.

40
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,512
" Enjoy your life in heaven!"

41
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:06,198
Please join me for tea
after you're finished here.

42
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,240
Thank you very much.

43
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,536
You don't say that!
What's wrong with you?! Get going!

44
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,814
Excuse me, Hara-sensei...
My name is Takeuchi.

45
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:44,520
I'd love it if you could introduce
my student here to Mr. Holder.

46
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,855
Emi.

47
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,364
She was Mickey-sensei's favorite student
in all the schools he taught at.

48
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,618
He said so himself.

49
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,667
And Mickey-sensei was the one
who taught her to paint.

50
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,296
This is Emi.

51
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:17,811
Don't be shy. Remember what
Mickey-sensei taught you?

52
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,853
Say " hello."

53
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,793
Well, class is about to start.

54
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,875
Please excuse us.

55
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,600
Hara-sensei! Daniel-san!

56
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,354
Go on. Give them to him.

57
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:09,085
These paintings are very special to her.
She wants Daniel-san to have them.

58
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,896
Daniel-san says "Thank you."

59
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:33,197
Emi, what did Mickey-sensei teach you
to say when someone says "Thank you "?

60
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,536
I'm sorry! We didn't mean to delay you.

61
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:54,422
Thank you, Takeuchi-sensei.
And thank you, Emi, for your gift.

62
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,905
I'm back.

63
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:08,277
Did you talk to Kubo-sensei's family?

64
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:13,031
I called.
They don't have a single painting.

65
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:19,209
Her father got very touchy.
He wouldn't tell me any details.

66
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,249
And no singing!
Daniel-san's had a very long day.

67
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:06,047
You just don't like
people having fun, do you?

68
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,671
I just don't like you having fun.

69
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,723
W- Wait!

70
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,601
Wait! Wait a second!

71
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,778
Daniel-san, please don't do this!

72
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,637
Yuichi, there's a black man here!

73
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:07,783
Who are you?
I don't want your kind near my house!

74
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,077
You've caused my family enough shame!

75
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,246
Get out of here!

76
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,204
I'm so sorry! This is all my mistake!

77
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,661
Who are you?

78
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,002
I'm Nakayama, from the
Tosa County Education Office.

79
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,208
I'm so sorry!

80
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,965
The education office?!

81
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,216
Please, Daniel-san, let's go!

82
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:37,430
Your office and the Prefectural
government will hear about this!

83
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:41,437
I know important people! Just you wait!

84
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,643
Beat it!

85
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,694
Daniel-san, let's go!

86
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:52,286
Please forgive us for disturbing you.

87
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,957
We're so sorry. Please forgive us.

88
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:00,252
Please forgive us. We're s-so s-s-sorry...

89
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,818
Do you understand what you've done?!

90
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,571
Do you understand your position as
a representative of the government?!

91
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,574
You completely lack common sense!

92
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,533
What were you thinking, bringing
this person to a private residence?!

93
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,958
You caused a lot of trouble!

94
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:14,416
And Inoue-san, you bear
a heavy responsibility for this too!

95
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:21,256
What kind of office are you running here?!
I'm at a loss for words!

96
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,556
I'm so sorry!

97
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:32,396
Please forgive my lack of leadership!
I deeply apologize!

98
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,699
I'm sorry, please excuse me.

99
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,620
Pardon me.

100
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,532
Emi, could we talk to you for a minute?

101
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,872
Emi, do you remember these paintings?

102
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,870
My gift to Daniel-san.

103
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,246
Yep!

104
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:19,627
He likes your gift very much!

105
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:26,430
And he's very interested in this one.

106
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:31,385
The painting of Kubo-sensei
and the little baby.

107
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:42,104
You wrote " Kubo-sensei
and her baby" here, right?

108
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,190
Why did you write that?

109
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:50,787
It's okay, Emi. Please answer.

110
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,794
It's a secret.

111
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:02,500
But you gave this painting
as a gift to Daniel-san.

112
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:05,802
He doesn't understand,
so why don't you tell him?

113
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,176
It's okay, Emi.

114
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,855
You've done nothing wrong.

115
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:23,609
But now Daniel-san just
wants to know if there's a baby, okay?

116
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,238
Cute.

117
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:49,009
Emi, Daniel-san is interested in
the color you painted the baby.

118
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:58,934
She's like Mickey.

119
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:07,397
Emi, do you meet Kubo-sensei sometimes?

120
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:16,786
Emi? Can you tell us where
Kubo-sensei and the baby are?

121
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,673
Emi.

122
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:36,185
Do you see how you painted this baby
and Mickey-sensei the same color?

123
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:41,811
That means Daniel-san
and the baby are connected.

124
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:48,943
And since he's connected to the baby,
he's also connected to Kubo-sensei.

125
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:02,753
Other people were
connected to Kubo-sensei.

126
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:07,879
But they talked like she was a bad person.

127
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,757
So she stays away from them.

128
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:19,178
But Daniel-san is different.

129
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,762
Why?

130
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:25,817
Because he's Mickey-sensei's father!

131
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,748
A foreigner!

132
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,854
Nakasone-san!

133
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,907
I wish he'd mind his own business...
