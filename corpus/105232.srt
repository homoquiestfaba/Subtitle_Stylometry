1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,504
- What should I tell Travis?
- Nothing. You're staying here.

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,632
No. General... Sam.
I gave my word!

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,592
That's an order.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,179
Dig her deep, boys.

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,555
Dig her deep.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,725
Dig her deep.

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,186
Good work, boys.

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,314
Always good to have a fall-back position.

9
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,442
About the size of a grave,
ain't it, Cap?

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,283
Captain Dickinson...

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,872
I'm reassigning you and Private Esparza
to the battery at the rear of the church

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,166
so you can be near your families.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,380
And I've arranged for a replacement
for your midnight watch.

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,966
Thank you, sir.

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,726
Gracias.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,402
Here you go, son.

17
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,114
So, Davy,

18
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,326
in all your Indian fightin',
you ever get into a scrape like this?

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,205
I was never in but one real scrape
in my life, feller.

20
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:25,627
- Yeah, but you was in the Red Stick War.
- Yeah, it's true. I was in that.

21
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,880
I sure was.

22
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,676
I was just about your age when it broke out.

23
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:38,932
The Creeks boxed up
about 400 or 500 people at Fort Mims

24
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,227
and massacred every one of'em.

25
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,815
Of course, this was big news around those
parts, so I up and joined the volunteers.

26
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,277
I did a little scoutin', but mostly...

27
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,990
I just fetched in venison for the cookfire,
things of that nature.

28
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:02,831
Well, we caught up with those redskins
at Tallushatchee,

29
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:07,169
surrounded the village,
come in from all directions.

30
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,965
Wasn't much of a fight, really.
We just shot 'em down like dogs.

31
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,594
Finally...

32
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,642
what Injuns was left,
they crowded into this little cabin.

33
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,478
They wanted to surrender.

34
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:32,361
But this squaw, she loosed an arrow
and killed one of the fellers,

35
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,738
and then we shot her.

36
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,785
And then we set the cabin on fire.

37
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:46,416
We could hear 'em screamin'
for their gods in there.

38
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,919
We smelled 'em burnin'.

39
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,426
We'd had nary to eat
but parched corn since October.

40
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,681
And the next day,
when we dug through the ashes,

41
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,267
we found some potaters
from the cellar.

42
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,482
They'd been cooked by that grease
that run off them Indians.

43
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,404
And we ate till we nearly burst.

44
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,497
Since then...

45
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,295
you pass the taters,
I'll pass 'em right back.

46
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,478
He's been stabbed three times,

47
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,772
once through the lungs,

48
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,358
shot two or three times.

49
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,612
Cholera, malaria, every two years.

50
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,472
He is already dead.

51
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,517
And this is the place he has been sent.

52
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,679
We got riders!

53
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:51,018
Pull back.
Riders on the way!

54
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,833
Colonel Travis.
Congressman Crockett.

55
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,506
I figure this is just about
every able-bodied man in Gonzales, sir.

56
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,926
Those soldados.
they think they got it all sewed up.

57
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,763
But you avoid the roads, there's this
little sliver you can just ease on through.

58
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,891
And Colonel Fannin is behind you?

59
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,851
He ain't here?

60
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:37,481
I talked to him three days ago in Goliad.
That son of a bitch said he'd be here.

61
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,150
How many rode with you?

62
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,820
Brung ya 32 good men, sir.

63
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,416
And if it ain't the prettiest bunch
of Texians I ever seen.

64
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,544
Let's hear it for Gonzales, boys!

65
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,105
Excelencia...

66
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,752
Come on!

67
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,589
Fight!

68
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,258
You're yellow!

69
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,177
We're waitin'!

70
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,271
You look better.

71
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,028
Thank you for tending to me.

72
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,155
And now I want you to leave.

73
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,617
Sam...

74
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,785
You, too.

75
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,043
You giving me my papers, Mr. James?

76
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,922
No. You're my property till I die.

77
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,467
And when I get up off my back,
I'm gonna come fetch ya.

78
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,512
For now I want you both to go.

79
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,599
Santa Anna ain't gonna
make that offer twice.

80
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,461
No. She was my sister.

81
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:15,300
You loved her.
Her blood was yours.

82
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,053
Your blood is mine.

83
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,431
We're family.

84
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:05,350
The men need a word from you.

85
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,394
I...

86
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,441
I don't know what to tell them.

87
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,458
My time in Washington,

88
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,669
the fellas in Congress
made a good deal of sport of me.

89
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,297
I learned an awful lot from 'em.

90
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,676
Learned how to dress,
to a certain degree,

91
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,014
what fork to use in polite company,
things like that.

92
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,310
I was never afraid to stretch things a bit.

93
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,940
But I never learned to lie.

94
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,115
These people in here
been through an awful lot.

95
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:09,248
And I would allow that
they've earned the right to hear the truth.

96
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,005
I have here pieces of paper,

97
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,509
letters from politicians and generals,

98
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:26,682
but no indication of when,
or if, help will arrive.

99
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,188
Letters not worth the ink
committed to them.

100
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,069
I fear that...

101
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,532
no one is coming.

102
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,637
Texas has been a second chance for me.

103
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:11,351
I expect that might be true
for many of you as well.

104
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,981
It has been a chance
not only for land and riches,

105
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,651
but also to be a different man.

106
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,655
I hope a better one.

107
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,288
There have been many ideas
brought forth in the past few months

108
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,498
of what Texas is

109
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,001
and what it should become.

110
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,463
We are not all in agreement.

111
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,761
But I'd like to ask each of you

112
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,805
what it is you value so highly

113
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,228
that you are willing to fight
and possibly die for.

114
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,942
We will call that Texas.

115
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,280
The Mexican army hopes to
lure us into attempting escape.

116
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:11,495
Almost anything seems better
than remaining in this place, penned up.

117
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:18,126
If, however,
we force the enemy to attack,

118
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:24,800
I believe every one of you
will prove himself worth ten in return.

119
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,888
We will not only show the world
what patriots are made of,

120
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,767
but we will also deal a crippling blow
to the army of Santa Anna.

121
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,192
If anyone wishes to depart...
under the white flag of surrender,

122
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,278
you may do so now.

123
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,530
You have that right.

124
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:57,040
But if you wish to stay here,
with me, in the Alamo,

125
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,919
we will sell our lives dearly.

126
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,669
Leave it.

127
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:27,422
The light. I want the light.

128
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,013
What troubles you, Buck?

129
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:39,726
I spoke to the men earlier about our
situation. You deserve to hear it as well.

130
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,106
I heard, through the door, every word.

131
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,694
My words.
How painful for you.

132
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,737
Good words.

133
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,574
Good words.

134
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,133
We could try to get you out with an escort.

135
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:16,180
If you're captured, perhaps, given
your condition, mercy would be extended.

136
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,141
I don't deserve mercy.

137
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,063
I do deserve a drink.

138
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:32,029
- You got anything stronger than water?
- I don't drink, Jim. You know that.

139
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,616
I gamble, go to whores,
run off on wives.

140
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,452
But drinkin'...
I draw the line.

141
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:45,459
You know, you live another five years,
you just might be a great man.

142
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:52,007
I think I will probably have to settle
for what I am now.

143
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,724
Buck...

144
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,774
Did it matter?

145
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,741
I'll see about fetchin' you a bottle.

146
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,299
God, I despise that tune.

147
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,302
I just figured it out.

148
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,641
Figured out what?

149
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,935
What it's missin'.

150
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,959
Take cover, boys!

151
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,810
Crockett.

152
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:01,321
It's amazing what a little harmony'll do.

153
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,117
Well, isn't that something?

154
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,250
Dearest Mary.

155
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:59,379
I hope someone with a kind voice
is reading this to you.

156
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:05,344
If you could see. you'd know
how beautiful this land- our home - is.

157
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,764
Kiss all six children for me.
and kiss them again.

158
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,684
The scarcity of paper. together with
other difficulties I've had to labor under.

159
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,728
has prevented me from writing before this.

160
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,772
and. indeed. it is a matter of claim

161
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,149
whetherthis letter
will ever reach the United States.

162
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,360
Please remember me to my father

163
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,948
and tell him to think of nothing but of
coming to this fair country when it is free.

164
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,617
I go the whole hog
in the cause of Texas.

165
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,702
I expect to help them
gain their independence

166
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,871
and to also form their civil government.

167
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,499
for it is worth risking many lives for.

168
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,377
From what I have seen
and learned from others.

169
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,673
there is not so fair a portion
of the earth's surface warmed by the sun.

170
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:46,677
We know what awaits us.
and we are prepared to meet it.

171
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,681
My respects to all friends.
confusion to all enemies.

172
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,558
God bless you.

173
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,726
Take care of my little boy.

174
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,761
General Cos...

175
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,524
Coronel Duque...

176
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,576
Romero...

177
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,084
Morales...

178
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,439
General Castrillon...

179
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,203
Agh!

180
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,433
iViva Santa Anna!

181
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,186
iViva Santa Anna!

182
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,819
Joe!

183
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,858
iFuego!

184
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,755
Faster, Joe, faster.

185
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,979
Ready? Fire!

186
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:04,276
The line gun! Fire!

187
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:07,529
Reload!

188
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,284
Shots... fire!

189
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,634
Keep it comin'.

190
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,149
Plug 'em, boys, plug 'em!

191
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,652
Pass me up a rifle.

192
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,880
Ready? Fire!

193
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:30,571
Fire!

194
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,244
iAyudeme! iAyudeme!

195
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:47,796
Fire!

196
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,718
Fire!

197
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,029
iFuego!

198
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,870
iFuego!

199
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,923
Keep 'em off the walls!

200
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:04,957
Keep it comin'.

201
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,207
Fall back!

202
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:27,789
Soy negro. No disparo.

203
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,835
Soy negro. No disparo.

204
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:35,088
Soy negro. No disparo.

205
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,926
Fire, boys! Fire!

206
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,943
Susanna!

207
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,926
iViva Mexico!

208
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,476
They're over the wall! Turn it around!

209
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:57,838
Fire!

210
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,092
iViva Mexico!

211
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,720
iViva Santa Anna!

212
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,324
Behind us!

213
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:28,577
They're behind us, boys!
They're behind us!

214
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,456
- Kill as many as you can!
- Kill them! Kill them!

215
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,578
Get down! Get down.

216
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,636
Micajah.

217
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,642
They've killed me, David. I...

218
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:43,235
I'm real sorry about all this.

219
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,480
Expliquele.

220
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:28,192
Throw yourself
on the mercy of His Excellency,

221
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,569
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

222
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:37,701
Are you San-tanna?

223
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:49,254
I thought he'd be taller.

224
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:19,159
Davy Crockett.

225
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,507
You tell the general

226
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:36,802
that I'm willing to discuss
the terms of surrender.

227
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,806
You tell him,

228
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:45,727
if he'll tell his men to lay their weapons
down and assemble peacefully,

229
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:52,526
I promise to take you all
to General Houston,

230
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:57,155
and I'll try my best
to save most of your lives.

231
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:02,786
That said, Sam's a might prickly.

232
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:07,040
So no promises.

233
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,173
Tell him.

234
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,849
Tell him!

235
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,477
Excelencia...

236
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:33,901
Excelencia!

237
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,210
I wanna warn you all...

238
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,631
I'm a screamer.

239
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,429
Aaarghhh!

240
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:10,729
Burn it all!

241
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,314
Burn this barn!

242
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:16,527
Burn it down.
Don't leave nothin' for the Mexicans.

243
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,904
Move, move, move!

244
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,184
Coronel Morales...

245
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:55,816
General Gaona...

246
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,961
How far east do we have to run
before we're safe?

247
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,463
You keep retreating, we have to, too.

248
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:21,466
Gimme one good reason why
we don't just dig in right here and fight.

249
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:31,226
"Sir, the enemy are laughing you to scorn."

250
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,396
"You must fight them.
You must retreat no further."

251
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,232
"The country expects you to fight."

252
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:41,403
"The salvation of the country
depends on your doing so."

253
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:44,823
"Signed, David G.Burnet, President."

254
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:08,555
The man's spineless. How far do we intend
to follow this traitor away from battle?

255
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,393
It's time to fight, boys.

256
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:15,312
Break camp.

257
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:18,190
We continue east.

258
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,613
They massacred our brothers,
and we're runnin'?

259
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:27,658
They have to pay.

260
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:31,161
If not now, you tell me when.

261
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:34,581
Break camp!

262
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,250
Let's go.

263
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:51,765
Sam, if we keep running,
you will lose your army.

264
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:58,230
20-odd years ago,

265
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:01,984
Napoleon returns from exile in Elba,

266
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:06,738
puts together an army
and moves east, swiftly,

267
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:10,075
before an alliance of nations can occur.

268
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:13,662
Wellington,

269
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:17,040
with fewer men, fewer armaments,

270
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,251
stays one step ahead of the French,

271
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,253
teasing them with his presence,

272
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:25,340
knowing that a large army
will have to splinterto keep up.

273
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:27,634
He moves and waits.

274
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:31,263
moves and waits
for Napoleon to make a mistake.

275
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:34,600
to fall into a scenario
that condemns him to defeat.

276
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:38,812
Wellington chooses the setting for victory

277
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:42,024
before it exists for him,
before he lays eyes on it.

278
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:45,652
It has an open battleground.

279
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,654
a sloping plain.

280
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,157
coverfor encampment.

281
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:54,786
and an opportunity to flank the enemy.

282
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:02,711
The Mexican army is splintered,
and though they do not know it,

283
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:08,425
Santa Anna's troops
subsist on gasps of air and sips of hope.

284
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,844
I share Wellington's battleground vision,

285
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:15,349
though I do not know
the name of the place that I imagine.

286
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,978
I, sir, do not consider myself Wellington.

287
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:26,610
Santa Anna, however, does consider
himself to be the Napoleon of the West.

288
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:32,366
We shall move and wait
until he makes a mistake

289
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:36,203
and presents us with his own Waterloo.

290
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:45,921
Stay back, everybody. Stay back.

291
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:48,006
Bring him here.

292
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:52,052
Water!

293
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:53,720
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.

294
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:54,805
Water!

295
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,474
Escucha. Escucha.

296
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,480
Deaf captured a Mexican courier.

297
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:08,318
His letters tell us that Santa Anna's nearby
and separated from the rest of his army.

298
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,253
General...

299
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:09,421
Left! Left, march!

300
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:17,721
Attention!

301
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,899
Back to back. Stay sharp.

302
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:35,739
Bayonets!

303
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,991
Ready!

304
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,451
March!

305
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:45,499
March!

306
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:25,581
Do you have a name?

307
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,427
There is a bridge behind the Mexican line.

308
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,431
Send Deaf Smith and his men to burn it.

309
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,226
Captain Seguin.

310
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:56,278
You and your men shall guard the camp.

311
00:53:56,361 --> 00:54:00,157
There could be confusion out there.
Men shooting any Mexican they see.

312
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,745
General, you ordered me to stay,
and I stayed.

313
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:07,289
But this is our fight, too.

314
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:12,461
You shall join Sherman on the left flank.

315
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:23,555
Two blades per man!

316
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:48,080
Company, shoulder arms!

317
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:11,061
You will remember this battle,

318
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,605
remember each minute of it,

319
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,066
each second,

320
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:19,278
till the day that you die.

321
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,656
But that is for tomorrow, gentlemen!

322
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:25,200
For today,

323
00:55:25,284 --> 00:55:28,036
remember the Alamo!

324
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,621
The hour is at hand!

325
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,292
Form ranks!

326
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,433
Battalion, halt!

327
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:53,312
Fire!

328
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,235
Fire!

329
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:05,032
March!

330
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,371
Remember the Alamo!

331
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:27,930
Forward guns! Fight!

332
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,073
Remember the Alamo!

333
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:49,159
iA la batalla. tejanos!

334
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:18,647
Dig the plot, boys.
Kill them all!

335
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,333
- Let's kill him and be done with it.
- Yeah!

336
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:04,127
I say we hang him from this very tree.

337
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:06,213
Yeah! Hang him!

338
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:08,674
Hang him!

339
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:10,884
No.

340
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:14,263
You'll settle for blood.

341
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:17,850
I want Texas.
