1
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:29,669
Love.

2
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,459
Love is so complex.

3
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:38,473
It can either be the greatest
feeling in the world or...

4
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,640
it can cause immense pain,

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,692
and usually it's us, people,
who cause that pain

6
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:49,857
because we're flawed,
dishonest, scared.

7
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:53,863
Emotional injury can be just as
crippling as physical injury,

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,306
disrupting our mood,

9
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,330
productivity and personal interactions
which all leads to more pain.

10
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:04,223
When left to deal with this trauma
on our own the cycle never ends.

11
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,576
But now,

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,547
through the Department
of emotional integrity

13
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,280
we can prevent this
cycle from ever beginning.

14
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,392
The DEI brings structure

15
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,280
to the chaotic mess that
comes with falling in love

16
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:19,236
by assigning emotional
integrity scores people are

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,971
held accountable for their actions

18
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,810
which promotes an
honesty and rationality.

19
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,372
This all leads to higher
productivity in the workplace,

20
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:27,900
greater financial credibility,

21
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,368
but most importantly,

22
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:31,491
successful relationships.

23
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:34,729
Since its establishment,
the DEI has helped

24
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:36,787
millions of people
in this country.

25
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,955
Our emotional health
and quality of life are

26
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,089
at its highest ever because we can all
finally have confidence in one another.

27
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:50,734
Now most of you here are
18 years old or very close

28
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:54,318
which is the legal age to register
relationships with the DEI

29
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,935
Once you're in our
system you'll be given a

30
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,821
neutral emotional
integrity score of 70.

31
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:04,189
From there it's your responsibility
to increase or decrease it.

32
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:06,813
Yes. How do you raise
your EI score?

33
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:11,268
That's a good question.
Does anyone here know?

34
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,082
What are you thinking?

35
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:16,595
You find a really special
girl you're crazy for,

36
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:20,059
get registered and
don't let her go.

37
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,774
[students chuckle]

38
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,468
Well that is part of it.
It is true that you can

39
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:29,294
increase your score by being in a
registered relationship that extends

40
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,839
beyond 12 months.

41
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,257
You can also increase your score

42
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,561
by registering with someone who
has a higher score than you.

43
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,067
Yes.

44
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,813
What does it mean when
other kids call my mom

45
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:43,906
a score digger?
- It means she's a slut.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,300
Hey now. There is nothing
wrong with being attracted

47
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:49,524
to individuals with
a higher score.

48
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:52,949
- Next question? Yes.
- What drops your score?

49
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,123
Well there are a
number of things,

50
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:57,508
the big one being of
course terminating a

51
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:58,980
relationship due to infidelity.

52
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,237
Also, registering
with a lower score individual,

53
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,697
terminating before 12 months,

54
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,996
relationship fraud. All the specifics can
be found here in this pamphlet.

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,695
Now kids, it's important
for you to remember that

56
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,189
a higher score today means
a happier tomorrow.

57
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:19,345
I've seen a lot of people your
age throw caution to the wind.

58
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,964
They didn't take their
score seriously.

59
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:24,600
And trust me, it's
never pretty sight.

60
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:30,332
Wow!

61
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:32,585
Wow, these are really,
really great Ben!

62
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,521
This is interesting, you worked as a
programmer for a little while.

63
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:38,665
I just needed some
stability, health care.

64
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,281
Honestly this is some
strong work.

65
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,386
Thanks.

66
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,885
Here's the thing. We're not only
looking for someone with a strong eye,

67
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,810
we're also looking for someone who
has great communication skills,

68
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,155
and works well on a team.

69
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,830
I, I agree

70
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:56,858
which brings me to our
next point, your EI score.

71
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:02,604
Here origin we have a minimum
EI score requirement for all

72
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:04,154
incoming employees.

73
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,603
I know my score is a
little on the low side.

74
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:09,418
Unfortunately it is below the minimum.

75
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,343
Which I, I assure you is just a mistake.

76
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:16,736
If it is just a mistake, we'll
give you some time to clear it up,

77
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,748
but really only after
that can we

78
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,653
have a serious talk you
joining Origin.

79
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:24,409

<i>A DEI representative will

- Great.

84

<i>Remember, if you want to
know more, check their score.</i>

85
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:42,594

86
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:44,143
Hi, um,

87
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,692
I'm calling because I think you
guys might have made a mistake

88
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,586
on my EI score.

91
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:19,294
So, based on everything
you've shared with me

92
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,160
I recommend this
business line of credit.

93
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,173
Okay.

94
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,894
Do I have permission to run
your credit and EI scores?

95
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,738
Yeah, of course.

96
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,592
So, what's the
name of your café?

No, its called "Friends

I like that one much better.

101
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:48,616
It was a bad joke but...

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,267
how many years have you been operating
or is this a brand new entity?

103
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,510
Brand new.

104
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,268
Congrats.

105
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,498
Okay, well it looks like your

106
00:05:57,522 --> 00:06:00,736
credit history is just
slightly above average.

107
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,582
I racked up a little debt while
I was in culinary school.

108
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,950
Your EI score is actually
pretty good.

109
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:14,307
So based on these

110
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,916
I am glad to let you know that you've
been approved for a business loan.

Okay, first, -IF- I get in.

cold in San Francisco.

I don't know.

I can't believe you made this.

Well, I'm still working on it. But...

135
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:40,791
I realize that a girl like you
only needs one glove really.

136
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:46,146
Well, what about my other hand?

137
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:53,281
That works, right?

138
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,024
Yeah, that works.

139
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,473
Is she leaving?

140
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:08,710
- We just got here!
- She said she's not feeling well.

141
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:12,745
Uh, honey, I love you; but
did you say something?

142
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:14,744
Of course not, she just...

143
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,210
she got the sense
tonight may be a set up

144
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,562
so she looked up Ben's score.

145
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,332
Oh my God!

146
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:23,625
Did you tell her that he's our best friend?

147
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:24,332
Your best friend.

148
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:27,211
Did you tell her that he's a great
guy and there's a good explanation

149
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,526
for his score? All right,
he was a top programmer

150
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,738
and he's working at Origin now!

151
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:33,123
Technically I'm still in
the application phase...

152
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,723
don't have a job yet.

153
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:40,216
Sorry, Ben. I didn't
realize you could hear us.

154
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,483
She just, she's a plus 80 and she said
she doesn't have time for a sub 40.

155
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,230
God this is so awkward.

156
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,121
I'm totally fine.

157
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,249
I meant for me.

158
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't feel bad.

159
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,496
It's not you, it's your score.

160
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,599
Okay.

161
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:55,415
Actually I know
how true that is.

162
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,617
You just...

163
00:08:56,641 --> 00:09:00,148
You need to fix your score Ben.
You're an adult now.

164
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:05,127
I'm sorry it didn't work out man.

165
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:08,362
I am totally fine it just
means she's not right for me.

166
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

167
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:12,211
Not right for you?
Are you kidding me?

168
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,940
- Her EI score is 82.
- Wow

169
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:18,053
Dating someone like her for a year
will up your score by like 50%.

170
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:21,920
Okay, but she has apparently already
decided that I am not worthy.

171
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,801
Ben, why are you doing
this to yourself man?

172
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:30,068
Look at Sandy and I. When we both turned
18 we did everything the right way, Okay?

173
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:33,985
We followed all the rules, we filed the
proper paperwork and what did that lead to?

174
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,138
I think when you guys
have is so nice.

175
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:39,398
Both of us being a plus 80's
when our paths finally crossed.

176
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:42,173
Can you imagine what you have
done if I screwed around

177
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:47,022
when and I was a sub 60 or 50 when
we met? She would have blown me off.

178
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:48,744
But look at us now. Right?

179
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,357
We're both plus 90s.

180
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,846
We have a great healthy relationship.
Don't you want that for yourself?

181
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,240
Just make an appointment at the DEI.

182
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:03,578
Oh, honey, I'm home.

183
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,261
Hey, where you been?

184
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:11,744
Uh, sorry, me and the guys
met at the happy hour and yep.

185
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:17,045
Nice! Well I was just trying
to call to let you know that I um..

186
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,977
I got the loan.

187
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,087
Dude..

188
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,120
I know!

189
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:24,333
I told you it would work out!

190
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,212
Yes. Sir. That is why I...

191
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:34,408
got you some
beautiful croissants.

192
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:37,085
Those are apple pie cookies.

193
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,495
Yes, yes they are.

194
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,546
Would you like one?

195
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,647
I'm good but please help yourself.

196
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,684
Okay, I'm celebratin', I'm celebratin'.

197
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,245
Whenever you want to celebrate
with me, I brought one for you.

198
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:50,078
Thank you!

199
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:55,005
[phone vibrates]

200
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,407
[phone ringing]

201
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,104
Ben?

202
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:03,114
Heh, heh, heh, uh, Sarah.

203
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,352
How are you?

204
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:10,199
Um, good uh sorry I
just... it's been so long

205
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:12,178
I thought maybe you
called me by accident.

206
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:16,129
Huh. Believe it or not, I
still have not met another...

207
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,584
Sarah since you.

208
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,968
It's been a while, huh?

209
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:29,266
<i>Um, actually If you're busy I
can call back another time.</i>

210
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,307
No, its fine. I'm just um
working on a menu.

211
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,859
<i>Oh, for what?</i>

212
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:39,492
I'm in the process
of opening up a café.

213
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,578
That's... amazing.

214
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,870
That's always been your dream.

215
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,805
Congrats.

216
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,097
Thanks.

217
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:52,114
I actually that's,
that's why I'm calling

218
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:56,006
<i>Did you know that we filed
conflicting termination reports?</i>

219
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,639
So, uh, it's giving me a
red flag on my record.

220
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,564
<i>I don't know if you
had the same problem.</i>

221
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:07,548
For a little while, but I started
dating someone so it kind of...

222
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:11,932
Right, yeah. Look that's really great.

223
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:18,041
Well mine never improved and
uh I'm up for this job.

224
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,067
So what you need from me?

225
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:26,525
Uh, would you be uh free sometime this
week to go down to the DEI with me and um.

226
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:30,981
They need us to be there in
person to work out the details?

227
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,994
I mean I'm pretty
busy lately Ben,

228
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,425
I've got the contractors
coming this week.

229
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:40,570
I can set up the appointment
it'll only take about an hour.

230
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,758
[she sighs]

231
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,707
I'm sorry to be bringing
up the past but...

232
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:52,339
I really need this... <i>please.</i>

233
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:58,899
Uh, Thursday, late afternoon,
I'll meet you there.

234
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:00,398
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

235
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:01,814
Alright I'll see you there.

236
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,082
Oh man even Melissa didn't get in.

237
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,507
She's like the smartest
person I know.

238
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:58,879
Don't even worry about it
she's book smart you're...

239
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,355

240
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:05,811

241
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,644
Alright so you ready?

242
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:11,580
Yeah no, ugh, I don't
know okay you go first.

243
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:13,622
We promise we do
at the same time.

244
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,023
Okay.

245
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,454
Can you believe they actually
used to do this by mail?

246
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:24,198
What if we don't get in?

247
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:27,465
What? No stop.

248
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,113
Be fine okay?

249
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,026
Promise?

250
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,083
Yeah, trust me.

251
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,445
Okay.

252
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:35,813
[deep breath]

253
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:37,428
- On the count of three, Okay?
- Okay.

254
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:37,983
One.

255
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:38,731
Two.

256
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:39,997
Three.

258
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,356

00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,486
Ben.

262
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:46,317
I'm sorry, can you...

263
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,531
I'm sorry I'm late.

264
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,765
Yeah, um [clears throat].

265
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,184
I guess technically
we're both a year late.

266
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:57,082
Yeah, right.

267
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,336
Thanks for coming.

268
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:02,422
Sure.

269
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,598
So what's this new job
you have on the line.

270
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:09,750
Um.

271
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:12,811
I have an opportunity
at a design firm.

272
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:15,038
Cool, programming?

273
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,058
Designing, actually.

274
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,961
<i>Now serving 18 A.</i>

275
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:21,915
Wow!

276
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:26,575
Well it's good. You always
talked about pursuing that.

277
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:32,937
Yeah. Talked too much
so I finally go for it.

278
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,935
Are you sure that you
want to do this?

279
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,549
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,438
I just...

281
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,767
I don't think that I'm going
to ever find anybody like you.

282
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,072
May I interrupt you?

283
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:53,685
Um, I think I heard enough.

284
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:56,765
Uh, Mr. Fischer, Mr. Bradley, uh

285
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,776
Thank you for doing your best
to recount your relationship.

286
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,989
I know situations
like this can be

287
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:06,701
difficult to look at with a clear head and
a clear heart and that's why I'm here.

288
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:13,184
So based on your testimonies I
am assigning Clint 76% fault

289
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,412
and the remainder to Scott.

290
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:14,965
But!?

291
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:20,149
Mr. Bradley, you will most likely find
love with someone else so don't worry.

292
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,098
Thank you.

293
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:22,098
You're welcome.

294
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:27,581
Mr. Fisher. That's a nice jacket.

295
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,288
Oh I can't believe this.

296
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,000
Thank you.

297
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:34,111
Confirmation reports will
be sent to you soon.

299
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,942
[door opens with squeak]

300
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,450
Hello.

301
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:46,082
Hi.

302
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:49,472
[door closes]

303
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,081
How can I help you.

304
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:57,032
Yeah, we were in a relationship that
ended a little over a year ago.

305
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:57,747
Okay.

306
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:00,942
We submitted termination
reports that we didn't...

307
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:03,577
exactly sign off
with each other.

308
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:09,157
Okay, well let's look at
your relationship history.

309
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:12,636
So you were in a registered
relationship for three years...

310
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,932
You had high numbers in all
relationship categories.

311
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:19,045
Started to dip towards
the end there.

312
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:25,322
And you both submitted termination
reports that didn't match.

313
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,099
- Right.
- Right.

314
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:32,549
As you know termination reports
must state the same reasons

315
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:36,113
and be signed off by both parties.
This is common knowledge.

316
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:36,956
Yeah.

317
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,034
That's right.

318
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:45,592
Uh, Ben, you reported that
Sarah was at full fault

319
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:48,104
for the termination
due to infidelity.

320
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,516
Wait, um. We're not, we're not
gonna go with your report are we?

321
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:55,023
Yeah.

322
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,977
I thought.

323
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,488
Ben that's ridiculous. You
know that's not what happened.

324
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,742
With Peter?

325
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,234
Who's Peter?

326
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:06,113
Touchy, handsy Peter?

327
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:08,574
The "I like to touch things
with my hands I'm a chef"?

328
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:13,062
Peter was a classmate nothing happened.
I've told you this over and over again Ben.

329
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,374
A kiss is nothing?

330
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,716
You kissed Peter?

331
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,071
Okay if you want to go there what
about you and what's her face?

332
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:20,618
Okay, we're going to
go with my report.

333
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,629
That is the definition
of nothing happened.

334
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:24,080
Debbie is one of my best friends.

335
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,660
We were close before you and I ever
started dating. You knew that.

336
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,051
You spent the night!

337
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,657
Yeah, that's very inappropriate.

338
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:32,356
You kicked me-she kicked me out.

339
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,060
What is going on? I thought that
we were gonna settle this today!

340
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:38,683
I'm not gonna sign off on
something that's not true.

341
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:41,985
Ben, that would drop my score so
low I'd lose the loan on my café.

342
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:46,414
I am up for an actual
job, not some pipe dream!

343
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,274
- I'm sorry.
- Wow!

344
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:56,178
No, that's fine I don't need this.
My score is fine.

345
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:58,120
- I'm sorry.
- Good luck Ben.

346
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,134
I...

347
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,239
[door opens]

348
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:02,830
[door slams]

349
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,348
We'll be right back.

Sarah!

352
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:22,616
Sarah, wait!

353
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,663
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

354
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:28,197
I'm not lettin' go, come on! Please,
please, please come back inside!

355
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:35,272
[window rolling down]

356
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:35,936
Please!

357
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,154
Just come back inside.

358
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:41,734
Get in.

359
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,646
Where are you going?

360
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,629
Get in the car Ben.

361
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:48,648
Is it in park?

362
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,242
- Get in the car!
- Okay, all right.

363
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:56,099
<i>Now serving 20 B.</i>

364
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:59,574
Well, it's nice to see such a
young couple like you guys.

365
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:01,065
We're really excited!

366
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:07,253
Um, so Haley. Uh, you will be attending
college up North this coming year...

367
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,439
And Seth, you will
be here in LA?

368
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:12,486
We actually applied to the same school
but I, I just can't keep up with her.

369
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,935
Uh, Is this your first long
distance relationship?

370
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:19,533
Yeah, this is actually both of
our first real relationship period.

371
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:20,779
Really?

372
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:23,367
Um. Okay.

373
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:25,746
Well you know relationships...

374
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,575
are tough but long distance relationships
have their own unique set of challenges.

375
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,697
This is not a light decision.

376
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:35,969
That's what everyone keeps telling us.

377
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,946
So, are you sure you want to proceed?

378
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,616
Yeah, well we know that
in order to get married,

379
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,849
a relationship has
to be registered for

380
00:21:43,873 --> 00:21:48,470
a minimum of one year. Right? So,
we just want to get a head start.

381
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:50,685
Nice. You know your stuff.

382
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,878
But just so you know.

383
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:56,318
Statistically couples
with more life experience

384
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:59,387
have a lot better chance at
actually getting married.

385
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:03,859
Yeah but I love her. So isn't
that all that matters?

386
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,924
Plus, like why can't
we be the exception?

387
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,554
Okay, just making sure.

388
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:17,506
Um, here is a pamphlet with tips on
maintaining a long-distance relationship.

389
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,385
Make sure you read that thoroughly.
Okay. Like thoroughly.

390
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:23,155
Okay.

391
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:24,395
Okay?

392
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,445
Your relationship registration
will process in a couple of days.

393
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:30,675
Congratulations, you are official.

394
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,976
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

395
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,162
You're welcome.

<i>Now serving 21 C.</i>

397
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:38,572
Hey!

398
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:40,221
Yeah?

399
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:43,038
You told him that you love me.

400
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:47,112
Yeah. Is that okay?

401
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:49,666
Do you really?

402
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,974
Yeah.

403
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,405
I love you too.

404
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:58,397
[pleased snortle]

[kissing sound]

406
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,525
Ben we're too old for this.

407
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:16,447
We owe each other
honesty at least.

408
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,951
Why do you think we broke up?

409
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:36,635
Yes I knew that Peter
had feelings for me.

410
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,693
And yes I kissed him. But...

411
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:45,453
It was a tough time for
me with school and...

412
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:51,587
we were falling apart and I was
weak and I made a stupid mistake.

413
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:57,233
I just think back to those last six
months and all of those fights

414
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,695
and and and about Peter

415
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,951
and your new schedule.

416
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:02,896
That wasn't all that was about. It
was about you and Debbie and and you

417
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,724
I just stopped trying...

418
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,861
With us.

419
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:14,068
It's easier to blame
someone else than...

420
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,654
admit your own faults.

421
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:27,101
You see that?

422
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:31,446
That's gonna be my new café.

423
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:36,714
You're short a couple of walls.

424
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:40,335
[both laugh]

425
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,624
As long as this whole...

426
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:46,440
reassessment doesn't
mess with things...

427
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,551
I'll help you.

428
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,074
I know how important
this is to you.

429
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:56,329
And I will not let our past
selves screw everything up.

430
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:00,949
They really had no idea
what they were doing.

431
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,226
Okay, so you have
both signed off on

432
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,695
50-50 responsibility.

433
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,490
This should significantly
help both of your scores.

434
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:23,162
The changes should appear on your
records within a day or two.

435
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:26,698
We did it! Have a nice day.

436
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:32,521
Hey are you hungry?

437
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:33,935
You want to grab a bite?

438
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:38,051
Oh, I've got to go home and check on the
contractors and Jeremy and I have plans.

439
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,153
Right.

440
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:41,709
It was good to see you.

441
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,765
Yeah.

442
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,455
I'm really glad to hear that
things are going well for you.

443
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,088
Thanks.

444
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:51,940
Hug.
[chuckles]

445
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,236
You know what? Um.

446
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,966
If all goes as planned I'm hoping
to have a soft opening in the fall.

447
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,018
You should come by.

448
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:06,185
Will you be there?

449
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,086
Uh. Yes.

450
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,079
Oh, well then... count me in.

451
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,126
Okay cool!

452
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,611
Um, I'll send you details
as it gets closer.

453
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:17,745
Sounds good.

454
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,638
I'm that way.

455
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,795
Yeah, I'm over here.

456
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,073
Okay.

457
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:33,314
I'm proud of you man.

458
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,611
I really am.

459
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:37,878
I mean it takes balls to go to after
what you're passionate about.

460
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:40,567
When are you going to do
the same for your passion?

461
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:41,233
Whoop!

462
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:44,591
All come on. Computer programming
is my passion you dick.

463
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,932
Hey Ben. I'm gonna head out do
you have the Spencer account?

464
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:51,418
Ooh, sorry.

465
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:54,332
Oh okay. So you're trying to get
me fired is what you're doing.

466
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:57,147
Ahh, you're doing pretty
good job there by yourself.

467
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:59,405
Oh. Ouch!

468
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:00,752
Hey move man.

469
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,995
[both chuckle]

470
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,190
I'm Henry.

00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:05,378
Anna.

472
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:08,049
I'm sort of the reason
Ben's at this job

473
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:11,027
That is definitely not true.

474
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:11,762
I thought so. All right.

475
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,838
[clears throat] Well
you're both welcome.

476
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,670
Oh, what are you still doing here?
I thought you had plans tonight.

477
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:19,996
Uh. Yeah. We are
gonna go to Lupe.

478
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,154
Luma.

479
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,199
Luma.

480
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,187
You should join.

481
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:27,195
Oh, um, I'm actually hanging out
with my girlfriends tonight.

482
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:28,305
She's hanging out with her…

483
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,333
Bring them! We like people.

484
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:34,046
Um. That place is a plus 80.
Right?

485
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,024
Yeah.

486
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:37,370
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work.

487
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:40,404
I mean some of the girls
are not quite up there.

488
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,926
I totally understand that.

489
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,062
This guy used to be that guy.

490
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:48,207
- Okay hey so.
- Yeah, well um.

491
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:50,886
Maybe I'll catch you after
I hang out with them.

492
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,171
Uh, yeah. Cool.

493
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:55,749
Let me know.

494
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:59,328
- Okay. Bye.
- See you later.

495
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:04,384
[mockingly] Yeah cool just let me know.

496
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,401
What's going on here?

497
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:08,456
I was being charming!

498
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,841
- Okay. When are you going to ask her out?
- What?

499
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:13,769
- You're not feeling the heat?
- You're wearing a sweater.

500
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:15,394
She was totally into you!

501
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:16,839
She's a plus 80!?

502
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:19,527
I mean that is exactly
what you need!

503
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,777
So any girl with a hint of interest
with a good score is my type?

504
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:25,728
I didn't say your type I
said exactly what you need.

505
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:29,363
I mean she's cute. She's in your line of work.
I don’t know, maybe she's your type too.

506
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:32,307
Whatever it is, you
managed to make it weird.

507
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:46,017
- Sorry man.
- Come on man.

508
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,618
All my friends are in there.
You can't make an exception?

509
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:49,963
80's and above, buddy.

510
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:53,067
I'm a 73 bro, come on.

511
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,748
There's a sub 60 place
around the corner.

512
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:59,744
Yeah, I know. I was just there.
Your mom says "Hi", bitch.

513
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:02,899
- Your hair look stupid.
- Come on.

514
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:11,781
Cool. You're good.

515
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:24,649
[tablet bleeping]
- You're good.

516
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,220
Oh my God! Do you
remember Diane?

517
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,834
- Uh.
- From accounting.
- Yes.

518
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:44,181
- Weird hair?
- Uh, yeah with [unintelligible]
- Yes exactly.

519
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:47,974
They caught her eating a piece
of old cake out of the trashcan.

520
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:49,392
I miss you at work!

521
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:51,329
I do not miss that place!

522
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:54,385
[chuckles] Well I love this place
and I love that you're here.

523
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,692
Yeah, this place is so... cool.

524
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,391
Yeah, it just...

525
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:02,979
It's awesome. Right? Knowing that
everyone here is a quality person.

526
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,395
I don't know man. You're here.

527
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:07,284
Okay, these people are
not even on my level!

528
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:10,882
- Nobody is. Hey, thank you.
- Um-hm.

529
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:14,692
Um... Here is to...

530
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:17,071
- Movin' up.
- Movin' up.
[glasses clink]

531
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:18,304
Congrats man.

532
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:19,927
Mmm!

533
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,284
Let me get you another one.

534
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:22,927
- We shall celebrate.
- [Unintelligible] It's my round.

535
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,277
Oh, whatever.

536
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,546
Isn't that Anna?

537
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:34,599
- Yeah.
- She ditched her friends for you.

538
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:38,670
- And she's in a... she's in a dress.
- Okay, alright, I'm gonna go talk to her.

539
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:43,924
- Uh, do you want something from the...?
- I want nothing. Ditch me. Ditch me!

540
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,445
Anna.

541
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,710
- Hi!
- Hey.

542
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:53,909
Uh, what happened to
girl's night out?

543
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:57,444
Oh, um, they decided to
go to some sub 40 place.

544
00:32:57,468 --> 00:33:00,527
It's like, they're my friends but I
don't even know why I bother sometimes.

545
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:02,551
Those places are such
a waste of time.

546
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:05,622
Oh, but we have the cream
of the crop here. Right?

547
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:08,499
Well.. Obviously.

548
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,965
Hey... Um....

549
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:17,073
I'm really glad you're
working at Origin now.

550
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:19,317
Me too.

551
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:21,789
And I'm happy we got to meet.

552
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,061
Yeah, I am too.
[chuckles]

553
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,156
[glasses clink]

554
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:40,124
- Hi!
- Hey!

555
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,041
How's the weather up there?

556
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:44,519
It's kinda nice.
Wanna check it out?

557
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:46,485
Yeah!

558
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:49,262
Alright, so...

559
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:51,446
Looks like we're all packed up.

560
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,694
Ready?

561
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:54,515
Yeah.

562
00:33:57,706 --> 00:33:59,793
I'm gonna miss you.

563
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:01,522
Ah, don't worry about it.

564
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:03,407
We have a plan. Remember?

565
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,522
I'll be up in a few weeks.

566
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:08,556
And you promise we'll
video chat every day?

567
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,347
Every day.

568
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:15,166
Unless you intend on, um, running off to a
frat party to go get drunk or whatever.

569
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,832
I'm not!

570
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:19,649
I'm purposely not gonna have
a life outside of class.

571
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:22,183
I'm just gonna study and
talk to you and that's it.

572
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:26,594
So you're gonna be that weird, creepy girl
in the dorms that never leaves her room?

573
00:34:26,618 --> 00:34:27,717
[laughs]

574
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:30,115
I'll be that girl... For you.

575
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,256
[kissing]

576
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:37,294
I love you.

577
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,053
I love you too.

578
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,851
Forever?

579
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:43,344
Forever.

580
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,818
So have you baked
your entire life?

581
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:04,175
Since I was a little girl maybe. The apple
pies actually are my grandma's recipe.

582
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,624
Really?

583
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:07,896
That's why their super tasty. I just
kinda doctor them a little bit.

584
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:13,026
- Um, excuse me one moment.
Thank you so much for coming.
- Sure.

585
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,650
Um... You made it!

586
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:17,689
Yeah.

587
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:21,138
This place is... finished.

588
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:24,711
Yeah. It's amazing what can
happen in four months.

589
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:27,147
[chuckles]
It looks great.

590
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:28,449
Thank you.

591
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:31,340
Babe, this place is so cute!

592
00:35:31,364 --> 00:35:32,668
Yeah. Isn't it?

593
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:35,676
Oh Anna, this is Sarah. Sarah
this is my girlfriend Anna.

594
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,230
Hi! It's so nice to meet you.

595
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:40,950
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations on the café.

596
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,482
Ben's been saying it's a longtime
dream of yours. That is so awesome!

597
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,400
Thank you. It has been.

598
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:49,931
Oh! There's a bar. Oh, that's so cute.
I'm gonna grab something.

599
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:52,191
- Babe, what do you want?
- Uh. B-beer.

600
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:56,083
Beer? Don't you think wine's a
little bit more appropriate?

601
00:35:57,145 --> 00:36:00,357
[both together slowly]
Uh, yes.

602
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:01,623
Okay I'll be back.

603
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:06,976
- She seems fun.
- Yeah, she's sweet.

604
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,300
Oh. So where's your boyfriend?

605
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:11,807
Oh, we split up a few months ago

606
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:15,665
- Oh. Uh. Sorry.
- Totally fine.

607
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:19,300
Have you tried anything yet?

608
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:22,067
- Uh, no.
- Follow me.

609
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,834
- These are yet to be named.
- Wait, what are these?

610
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:28,869
- Cranapple oatmeal.
- Aw, yes!

611
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:31,125
These are hands down my fave!

612
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:34,506
Mmm.

613
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:37,421
You should consider
calling these "The Ben".

614
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,957
Yeah, I'll think about it.

615
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:43,873
So, when is the grand opening?

616
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:48,342
Uh, maybe a month. I mean there's
still some things left to do.

617
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:51,519
- Here you go babe. - Oh.
- See now its an opening.

618
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,883
Yeah, my beer-wine!

619
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:59,163
So, here is to a very sweet
and very successful future.

620
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:03,011
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

621
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:04,815
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

622
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,083
Oh no I was just telling

623
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,828
Ben that I really want to do
something with this wall. I just...

624
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,451
don't know what.

625
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:13,618
I could see a mural here.

626
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:16,531
Yeah, that would be perfect!

627
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:19,744
- Well I could work on something.
- Oh, no. That's too much trouble.

628
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:21,082
No it wouldn't be at all.

629
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,877
You have time for that? With
everything that's going on at Origin?

630
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,982
It, it's really too much to ask.

631
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:28,226
It would be no problem.

632
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,805
Ben, I'll definitely
let you know.

633
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:31,948
Okay.

634
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:37,361
And in the meantime I could definitely
use both of your help eating these.

635
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:50,728
This place needs a sky.

636
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,657
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

637
00:38:02,164 --> 00:38:06,883
Is this about me helping Sarah?
'Cause... I don't have to.

638
00:38:08,902 --> 00:38:12,488
I'm sorry. I should've asked
you before I offered.

639
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:16,147
I can just tell her that I
don't have time for it.

640
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:20,622
No, no that's okay. I mean you
guys were a long time ago.

641
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:23,171
I have nothing to worry about.
Right?

642
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:28,404
- Of course not.
- Promise?
- Yes.

- Hi.

664
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,699
- I thought I gave you the day off.
- Did you say that?

665
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:27,572
Uh, I'm closing early. I'm meeting up with
Ben to go over the plans for the mural.

666
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:32,252
Yeah, you probably forgot because I mentioned it
when you were on the phone with your girlfriend.

669
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:41,369

Yeah, we used to.

I know, but I thought maybe we could just
go, and you can I don't know, relax there.

00:46:51,582 --> 00:46:54,610
And they were handing out
coupons on the quad today so…

can eat there if you're hungry

extensive project, huh?

lot of moving pieces.

what you have with Anna is so good.

And she could totally use something
like this against you if you terminate.

me lend you this stuff.

I don't have beer,

803

but if you're interested I do
have something a little stronger.

You know that I started
drinking scotch because of you?

00:49:31,671 --> 00:49:34,395
You mean that in a
good way, right?

807
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:38,813
Because I really hope I didn't turn
you to drink after we broke up.

they sort of got us here and…

but, I liked it all.

Yeah well Ben you like the powdered
sugar donuts that come in six packs.

close in a year.

to that restaurant you used to work at.

dumb and shallow as you.

You know what's funny?

834
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:38,817
When we were together I used to
picture this moment... with you in it.

835
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,836
And then we broke up and…

836
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:49,934
I stopped envisioning it that
way, I just... removed you.

837
00:51:52,249 --> 00:51:58,807
And now in the end, you're...
actually here.

- Um, yeah. That's, that's great babe.

excited for you. I'm just...

00:53:46,511 --> 00:53:50,741
Yeah but I was working my ass off
so we don't have <i>to go through…</i>

858
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:52,495
<i>Another year of long distance.</i>

859
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:55,238
- Hey.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah no um. Hey
let's just talk about this later.

860
00:53:55,262 --> 00:53:56,751
Okay, um, I'm kind of...

861
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,129
- Alright, yeah.
- Okay, alright, I love you.

862
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,531
- Yeah, I love you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

863
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:06,999
- So, what are you doing this weekend?
- Nothing. Why?

864
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:11,741
The guys from the other team are Sigma's
and they invited us to a party.

865
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:16,056
- Do you want to go?
- I don't know if I should.

866
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,327
Come on! You never
come out with us.

867
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:23,748
I'd be a bad friend if I never
got you out this whole year.

868
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:28,632
Please! Come on it'll
be so much fun!

869
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:32,907
- Okay. Yeah.
- Wait, I didn't expect that.

870
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:34,700
- Yeah.
- What?

871
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:40,219
- Stop!
- Everyone she's going to a party!
- It's no big deal! Stop!

872
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:48,611
- This is bad
- I know.

873
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,020
If I don't draw more
energy cards I am screwed.

874
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:57,856
What you did is beyond bad.

875
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,448
I know, I'm gonna fix it.
I have to fix it.

876
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:03,038
What did you expect man?

877
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:06,583
Oh I'm gonna spend night and
day with my ex-girlfriend,

878
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:10,550
Working on a fun and exciting new
project that I'm sure won't lead to us

879
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,164
Reigniting our feelings
for each other.

880
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,547
I warned you not to put
yourself in this position.

881
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:19,428
It's not like a planed for this to
happen when we started the project.

882
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:22,350
If you knew what was
happening, why'd you go back?

883
00:55:22,374 --> 00:55:26,917
I guess it, it's not like
were getting another chance.

884
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:29,905
There's maybe a chance
I always wanted it.

885
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:33,140
What are you guys talking about?

886
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:36,154
Uh, just girl problems.

887
00:55:36,178 --> 00:55:38,906
It's hopefully something you won't
have to deal with for a long time.

888
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:42,480
I have a girlfriend. I know
all about girl problems.

889
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:46,133
Okay no, you do not have a girlfriend, kid.
What are you, like 10?

890
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:50,910
- I'm eight.
- I'm losing to an eight-year-old.
- Humbling isn't it?

891
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:56,163
Ben, you do not have a girl problem.
You have a girl... situation.

892
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,932
It hasn't turned
into a problem yet.

893
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:01,696
I have to terminate with Anna.
I have to.

894
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,934
You've been together
for less than a year.

895
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:07,233
If you terminate now you can kiss
your score and Origin goodbye.

896
00:56:07,257 --> 00:56:09,100
Everything you've worked
for... out the window.

897
00:56:09,124 --> 00:56:12,018
I can't stay with her. Okay?

898
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:15,857
What am I gonna lie to her?
That would make me a fr...

899
00:56:16,337 --> 00:56:22,059
- a dishonest person.
- Oh, so now you're worried about honesty.

900
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,957
Look I'm not saying you guys
have to stay together forever.

901
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,078
Just you know, long enough
so if you guys break up,

902
00:56:28,102 --> 00:56:30,647
you're not can have a
huge hit on your score.

903
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:34,929
You're not helping yourself or
Sarah if you terminate now.

904
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:37,488
- I win!
- Let's go again.

905
00:56:37,512 --> 00:56:40,777
- But I'm tired.
- You're eight. What you tired from?

906
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:43,119
Beating you.

907
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:52,053
- Hey.
- Hey, you're early!

908
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:55,946
Yeah, I sort of
wanted to talk first.

909
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,122
- Is now a good time?
- Yeah.

910
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:02,494
I'm just, uh prepping for our
reception tomorrow night.

911
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:05,506
So what's up?

912
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:11,753
I wanted to talk
about last night.

913
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:14,327
Right. Uh.

914
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:17,943
- Ben, before we get into it.
- Anna, I'm sorry.

915
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:22,244
I know that it was…

916
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:25,309
It was what?

917
00:57:26,872 --> 00:57:29,834
Out of line?

918
00:57:29,858 --> 00:57:34,388
And I wanted to apologize.

919
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:39,738
But look, I want to finish
this mural with you and…

920
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:45,314
I wasn't sure what you thought.

921
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:50,498
Maybe we should...
have some space.

922
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:55,057
Because otherwise things could get complicated
when they really don't need to be.

923
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:56,566
The things like last night?

924
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,753
Yeah.

925
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:05,621
- It was my fault. I drank too much and…
- Ben it's fine!

926
00:58:05,645 --> 00:58:10,770
If we let ourselves slip a little
bit it's nothing more than that.

927
00:58:10,794 --> 00:58:13,156
Right?

928
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:18,438
Right.

929
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:21,563
Okay.

930
00:58:21,587 --> 00:58:27,217
So I'd... talk to
you later then.

She went out with Tiff.

Please don't ask me
where they went.

954

Oh, Jesus Christ.

the guys in this frat?

Um, kind of, I mean
they invited us here.

- Yeah…

01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:51,311
You probably shouldn't be
hanging out with those guys.

963
01:00:51,335 --> 01:00:55,737
They make their pledges do this
awful thing called score the score.

- Really?
- Yeah, they really like you.

I can totally see you getting
promoted as lead designer soon.

because then I can quit!

stay home and take care of the kids.

I should be done this week.

1000

Anything happen between you two?

I've been meaning to talk
to you about this all week

1004
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:25,471
Were you physical?

1005
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:29,169
We had a drink to celebrate
the other night and…

1006
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:32,024
We got a little tipsy
and we kissed.

1007

But it's the only time
that ever happened.

1008
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:37,976
Oh well thank God because then
you'd really be messed up.

1009

- Anna, I'm sorry.
- No! You lied to me!

From the very beginning you told
me I had nothing to worry about!

1011

You made me look like an idiot! I knew
I shouldn't have trusted that bitch.

- Sarah would never…
- Do not defend her right now!

1013
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,699

file for termination.

through my stuff?

01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,835
- I was going to, I…
- But you never even mentioned it.

1024
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:06,188
It's just something I'm looking into. I
haven't even decided if I'm gonna go.

1025
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:12,950
Why do you have everything planned out?
Like where you wanna live? Classes?

1026
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:21,643
It's a really amazing
opportunity.

1027
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,916
What! What the hell? Do you…

1028
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:29,926
Do you know how hard I've been working
to save up to move up here? No!

1029
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:32,561
- I never ask you to do that.
- Huh, wow!

1030
01:05:32,585 --> 01:05:34,452
Well, I'm sorry for
trying to make this work.

1031
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:35,461
Huh!

1032
01:05:35,744 --> 01:05:39,901
Okay, you know what? I'm
trying really hard too.

1033
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:43,973
Okay, you're the one making all these plans and
decisions and you never asked me about them.

1034
01:05:43,997 --> 01:05:46,216
You never asked to come up.
You just come…

1035
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,572
and then I'm expected to just
clear my entire schedule

1036
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,535
because you never wanna do
anything with my friends.

1037
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,195
And now this whole you're
transferring early thing?

1038
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:56,367
So spending time with me is
an inconvenience to you?

1039
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:57,355
[exhales]

1040
01:05:57,379 --> 01:06:05,380
No, I never said that. I just...
need some space sometimes.

1041
01:06:05,404 --> 01:06:08,364
To live my life up here.

1042
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:15,058
Well, I can help you with that.

1043
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,944
[laughing] Get in.

1044
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,087
We're going to get caught!

1045
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:43,789
So what? If we get kicked out
we'll just climb right back up.

1046
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:47,867
- They're going to fine you.
- I'll take extra shifts.

1047
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:51,205
This is so crazy! I love it!

1048
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:57,758
This weekend went by too fast. I'll
have to take you home with me.

1049
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,941
Take me everywhere with you.

1050
01:07:02,567 --> 01:07:04,192
[kissing]

1051
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,773
[door opening]

1052
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,121
- Excuse me.
- Hi. What can I get for you?

1053
01:07:32,145 --> 01:07:34,677
- Are you Ms. Hayashi?
- Yes.

1054
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:37,184
If you have a few minutes we'd
like to ask you some questions.

1055
01:07:38,028 --> 01:07:40,178
What is this about?

1056
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:44,474
We're with the DEI fraud
inspections division.

1057
01:07:50,328 --> 01:07:52,542
[phone chimes]

1058
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:05,907
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1059
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:08,040
Yeah, sure. What's on your mind?

1060
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:12,323
Did you ever feel like nothing's
going according to plan?

1061
01:08:12,347 --> 01:08:16,846
Well, today kind of felt like that.
And yesterday too.

1062
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:20,984
and the day before that. So yeah,
I think I know the feeling.

1063
01:08:21,008 --> 01:08:25,596
I just, I really believed things
would be going a certain way.

1064
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:30,365
But now everything's
just falling apart.

1065
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:33,142
Are we talking about
your boyfriend?

1066
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:37,127
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Sorry about that.

1067
01:08:37,151 --> 01:08:42,685
We registered before we came here.
We were so sure.

1068
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:46,736
- But now…
- But now you're not so sure.

1069
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:53,140
Look, Haley. Having a plan doesn't
always mean having control.

1070
01:08:53,164 --> 01:08:55,903
- That's just life.
- Yeah.

1071
01:08:55,927 --> 01:08:59,715
Now, learning how to move forward
when you don't have that control...

1072
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:02,203
That's growing up.

1073
01:09:02,227 --> 01:09:05,855
- Sounds like you know a lot about that.
- Yeah.

1074
01:09:05,879 --> 01:09:07,538
Yeah it does. Doesn't it?

1075
01:09:08,115 --> 01:09:11,767
You'll be okay. More than okay.

1076
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,697
See you Thursday?

1077
01:09:24,813 --> 01:09:27,938
You know I wish I could say
you weren't a good fit here.

1078
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:33,963
But, the truth is we just, we
have to follow our guidelines.

1079
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,057
Terminating your relationship

1080
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:39,882
will unfortunately bring your score back
down below our minimum requirement here.

1081
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:41,741
I understand.

1082
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,659
I'm really sorry Ben.

1083
01:09:44,683 --> 01:09:47,932
Letting people go is never easy.

1084
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:50,256
But it's my job,

1085
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,246
and if I have to do it,

1086
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:56,778
I usually tell myself that they
were always meant something else.

1087
01:10:03,557 --> 01:10:05,447
Ben.

1088
01:10:15,852 --> 01:10:19,402
You know I didn't
want this to happen.

1089
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:23,958
Anna, this is...

1090
01:10:23,982 --> 01:10:26,507
Far from your fault.

1091
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:32,327
I'm sorry, I lost sight of us.

1092
01:10:32,351 --> 01:10:35,041
I kept things from you.

1093
01:10:36,162 --> 01:10:41,759
I did it because I
was weak and afraid.

1094
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,803
I'm sorry.

1095
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:52,720
I didn't file my termination report.

1096
01:11:02,423 --> 01:11:06,197
[phone vibrating]

1097
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:12,836
- Haley.
- Seth, Hey!
- Hi.

1098
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,954
<i>I'm so glad you called.</i>

1099
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:19,002
Yeah, um, I'm sorry.
I, it's just...

1100
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:22,759
It's been a really weird
time and I was just…

1101
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:25,212
<i>Doing some thinking.</i>

1102
01:11:25,236 --> 01:11:27,189
Hey, yeah me too. It's fine.

1103
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,057
Are you doing right now? Um.

1104
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:31,662
<i>Can you talk?</i>

1105
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:36,944
I'm actually just getting
dropped off at the airport.

1106
01:11:36,968 --> 01:11:40,391
What are you doing at the airport?

1107
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:43,098
I'm flying up to see you, babe.

1108
01:11:43,122 --> 01:11:44,453
What?

1109
01:11:44,477 --> 01:11:48,103
I thought it would just be faster to
fly up and work this out in person.

1110
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:53,952
Seth? Look, you're doing it again.
Okay? You're, you're making…

1111
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,002
decisions for us and just assuming
that I'll be fine with it.

1112
01:11:57,026 --> 01:11:59,097
Yeah, but you weren't
answering your phone.

1113
01:11:59,121 --> 01:12:01,214
And what's wrong with
me wanting to see you.

1114
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:03,960
You don't get it. I mean,
it's, it's not about…

1115
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:06,220
Seeing each other. Okay? It's about…

1116
01:12:06,244 --> 01:12:09,285
growing with each other. And right
now we're not growing because

1117
01:12:09,309 --> 01:12:12,602
<i>you're the only one making any decisions
for how this relationship is working</i>

1118
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:16,538
- And every time I try to tell you that…
- So I'm just holding you back?

1119
01:12:16,562 --> 01:12:19,356
You just get upset.

1120
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:22,664
Babe, we'll just talk about
this in person. Okay?

1121
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:27,672
Seth, don't get on the plane.
Okay? Just…

1122
01:12:27,696 --> 01:12:30,557
Please, please don't come up.

1123
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:33,263
Why not?

1124
01:12:35,599 --> 01:12:39,319
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

1125
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:42,600
What are you trying to say? Like...

1126
01:12:43,424 --> 01:12:45,941
Like no more visiting, or...

1127
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:48,779
just wait till you come
back for summer, right?

1128
01:12:48,803 --> 01:12:50,614
No.

1129
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:54,777
Like... I think we should terminate.

1130
01:12:56,218 --> 01:12:59,671
What? No! <i>Haley stop! What?</i>

1131
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,260
<i>Please, not like this,
not over the phone.</i>

1132
01:13:02,284 --> 01:13:05,939
- Just give me two hours. I'll be right
 over to work this out. Okay?
- Seth, Seth stop.

1133
01:13:05,963 --> 01:13:09,801
I, I can't do this anymore.
Okay?

1134
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:13,769
I mean, we're not the same people.
We're not living the same lives.

1135
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:16,322
I mean, don't you see?

1136
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:19,783
But I love you.

1137
01:13:24,425 --> 01:13:28,026
Our love isn't the same either.

1138
01:13:33,193 --> 01:13:35,513
I'm sorry.

1139
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:11,033
- Ben!
- Sarah are you okay?

1140
01:14:11,057 --> 01:14:12,216
What are you doing here?

1141
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,087
Well I've been calling
but you didn't pick up.

1142
01:14:14,251 --> 01:14:16,285
Because I didn't
want to talk to you.

1143
01:14:17,671 --> 01:14:19,148
Totally fair.

1144
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:21,975
Look, I, I know that you are...

1145
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,900
pissed at me and I am sorry.

1146
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:26,306
- This is not about you, Ben.
- Just let me finish. Okay?

1147
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:29,492
This is important.
I am an idiot.

1148
01:14:29,516 --> 01:14:31,372
Okay?

1149
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:36,836
Anna found out what happened between
us and was about to terminate with me.

1150
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:41,445
I would've lost my job,
her, my score everything.

1151
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:43,845
She wanted to give
me another chance.

1152
01:14:45,172 --> 01:14:46,973
But I told her no.

1153
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:50,886
Because it wouldn't be right.

1154
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,793
It wouldn't be fair. Because I…

1155
01:14:54,646 --> 01:14:56,058
want to be with you.

1156
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:07,859
Sarah.

1157
01:15:11,455 --> 01:15:14,570
It was only supposed
to be one year.

1158
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,811
No strings attached.

1159
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:19,632
I'm sorry. What?

1160
01:15:22,035 --> 01:15:24,878
When you and I broke up.

1161
01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:28,604
The thought of opening this place was
the only thing that kept me going.

1162
01:15:30,156 --> 01:15:35,498
I needed a loan. But my score was too low
so I had to find a way to raise it. Quick.

1163
01:15:37,048 --> 01:15:38,673
Jeremy was...

1164
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,797
just a friend but he...

1165
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,299
had this idea...

1166
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,347
something he had done before...

1167
01:15:46,371 --> 01:15:48,432
Sarah, what are you saying?

1168
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:51,923
I faked my score.

1169
01:15:54,536 --> 01:15:59,186
I know it's fraud but it's not
like anyone was gonna get hurt.

1170
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:02,817
What happens now?

1171
01:16:09,594 --> 01:16:11,149
It's all over.

1172
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:20,300
With the penalties I'm a sub 20 now
so the bank is retracting my loan.

1173
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,141
They're taking it all back.

1174
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:27,351
Not to mention the fines. So...

1175
01:16:30,164 --> 01:16:31,602
I have nothing.

1176
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,913
- We'll figure this out together.
- No, I'll figure this out.

1177
01:16:39,937 --> 01:16:43,399
I was fine before you came
back into the picture.

1178
01:16:43,423 --> 01:16:47,847
It's because I helped you with your score they
looked into my record again in the first place.

1179
01:16:47,871 --> 01:16:50,293
This relationship keeps
coming back to haunt me.

1180
01:16:50,317 --> 01:16:52,382
I'm done, Ben.

1181
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:53,726
What about what I just said?

1182
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,259
What that now you want me
because you have nothing left?

1183
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:59,794
No, that is not what I meant.
I, look if anything... I...

1184
01:16:59,818 --> 01:17:02,790
I loved you so much, Ben.

1185
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:09,315
It was hard enough when we terminated.
And these last few months…

1186
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:13,049
I let you back in.

1187
01:17:14,114 --> 01:17:16,686
And you tell me it was all a mistake?

1188
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:21,872
You make me feel so stupid.

1189
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:28,926
And now you're back and you want to fight
for me? Oh, I'm sorry it's too late.

1190
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,922
Look, I know that I hurt you but...

1191
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:36,809
What if this happened for a reason? You
know, now we can have another chance.

1192
01:17:38,194 --> 01:17:39,600
Oh.

1193
01:17:40,317 --> 01:17:42,053
Look at us Ben.

1194
01:17:42,839 --> 01:17:45,942
Our lives are shit.
Our scores are shit.

1195
01:17:45,966 --> 01:17:50,386
I mean do you honestly think that getting
back together right now is a great idea?

1196
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,560
- Yes.
- How do you know that?

1197
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,765
Because I love you.

1198
01:18:00,318 --> 01:18:03,091
I don't love you anymore Ben.

1199
01:18:24,564 --> 01:18:26,519
No one ever told me
this was an issue.

1200
01:18:26,543 --> 01:18:30,032
I'm sorry, but as I said,
it's a policy of the program.

1201
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:33,297
What does my EI score have
to do with my education?

1202
01:18:33,321 --> 01:18:37,678
I mean my GPA dropping or not having
enough credits fine but this is absurd.

1203
01:18:37,702 --> 01:18:39,875
As I said, I am sorry

1204
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:42,165
but the list of eligible
students is quite long so

1205
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:44,748
all things must be
taken into account.

1206
01:18:45,942 --> 01:18:48,383
Although only slightly lower,

1207
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:53,383
no other student had
anything on their records.

1208
01:18:56,665 --> 01:19:02,260
Remember what I said about having a plan
doesn't always mean having control?

1209
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:13,848
Who know, you know maybe...
this is the start of something new.

1210
01:19:13,872 --> 01:19:15,952
something...

1211
01:19:17,823 --> 01:19:18,854

01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,723

Hey. Haley.

1218
01:19:55,018 --> 01:19:58,503
I did not… I didn't
think you'd pick up

1219
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:03,330
Guess I thought it'd be
nice to hear your voice.

1220
01:20:04,339 --> 01:20:08,088
Yeah. Just weird not
talking to you anymore.

1221
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,899
It'll be normal someday.

1222
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,790

I know, I know, I know.

1226
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:25,430
It's just I was feeling kind of down and...

1227
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:28,160
Every time I'd felt that way I
would just call you. It's just…

1228
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,615
Yeah, but.

1229
01:20:31,323 --> 01:20:34,081
We're not together anymore.

1230
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:36,859
Wow. Yeah. Thank you...

1231
01:20:36,883 --> 01:20:38,478
for that reminder
Haley because I

1232
01:20:38,502 --> 01:20:40,925
totally forgot that you broke
up with me over the phone.

1233
01:20:46,344 --> 01:20:48,173
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1234

gonna move up here?

moving to London <i>I really…</i>

Wait what?

1242
01:21:12,779 --> 01:21:16,324
Our termination
dropped my score…

1243
01:21:16,348 --> 01:21:20,276
And apparently they consider
that for the program.

1244
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,190
Isn't there anything
you could do?

1245

could be an exception.

1262
01:22:42,885 --> 01:22:44,170
To what?

1263
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:47,572
To everything that people told
us when we first registered.

1264
01:22:48,888 --> 01:22:51,848
I thought we'd outlast all the
doubts, all the distance...

1265
01:22:51,872 --> 01:22:56,594
All the warnings about young
love. But… We couldn't.

We weren't the exception. We
were just another example.

- The scores only going to prove that.
- No.

1274

The score only shows you
what happened. Not…

1275
01:23:38,401 --> 01:23:39,956

So, why am I being audited?

1298
01:25:52,692 --> 01:25:56,595
My relationship with Sarah was way
before Jeremy was ever in the picture.

1299
01:25:56,619 --> 01:25:59,051
It's a standard DEI protocol.

1300
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:01,925
In EI score fraud cases we

1301
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:03,958
Uh, do background investigations

1302
01:26:03,982 --> 01:26:07,206
on the accused past relationships
to rule out further collusion.

1303
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:11,415
In other words we want to make sure your
relationship with Sarah was legitimate.

1304
01:26:12,071 --> 01:26:15,816
Shouldn't you have this
information in your system?

1305
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:22,576
Well we have statistics and data
but there are certain… Limits.

1306
01:26:23,018 --> 01:26:24,709
That's one way to put it.

So, when you first met Sarah, was
it arranged by any third parties?

1313
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:53,205
Yep, I was on a blind
date with a third party…

1314

couldn't stop thinking about her.

1315
01:26:56,701 --> 01:26:59,515
- Was there any money exchanged?
- Yeah.

1316
01:26:59,539 --> 01:27:05,466
Was this money exchanged in agreement for
any fraudulent relationship activity?

1317
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:08,330

1360
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:55,922
even after they're out of my life.

1361
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,202
You and the DEI can give people
whatever number you want, but...

1362
01:31:02,226 --> 01:31:06,244
we make the mistakes.

1363
01:31:06,863 --> 01:31:10,649
We should be allowed to take risks

1364
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:16,350
and fail and love without
a score to consider.

1365
01:31:18,152 --> 01:31:21,379
<i>The system simply exists
to minimize risks</i>

1366
01:31:21,403 --> 01:31:24,526
<i>and potential emotional
damage between couples.</i>

1367
01:31:27,214 --> 01:31:29,839
That's too bad.

1368
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:33,258
You guys...

1369
01:31:33,282 --> 01:31:37,888
try to make love easier, but
you're missing the whole point.

1370
01:31:37,912 --> 01:31:40,228
It's not supposed to be...

1371
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:42,806
easy.

1372
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,052
It's supposed to test you,

1373
01:31:47,076 --> 01:31:49,056
break you down,

1374
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,735
and hurt like hell.

1375
01:31:55,328 --> 01:31:57,907
The we who choose to
go through that way.

1376
01:32:01,368 --> 01:32:04,063
That's what's really important.

1377
01:33:57,294 --> 01:33:58,973
Ben?

1378
01:33:59,423 --> 01:34:01,485
Sarah!

1379
01:34:03,524 --> 01:34:05,446
What are you doing here?

1380
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,689
I just uh...

1381
01:34:09,713 --> 01:34:11,756
wanted to finish this.

1382
01:34:15,052 --> 01:34:19,169
You know they sold the place. Right?

1383
01:34:19,193 --> 01:34:20,364
Yeah.

1384
01:34:22,796 --> 01:34:24,171
So that's it, huh?

1385
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:29,332
Um, I guess I should give
these back to you then.

1386
01:34:29,356 --> 01:34:30,684
[keys jingle]

1387
01:34:31,145 --> 01:34:34,385
Alright. Um...

1388
01:34:36,283 --> 01:34:37,650
Thanks.

1389
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,533
So. How have you been?

1390
01:34:41,274 --> 01:34:43,969
Getting by. I guess.

1391
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:45,577
You?

1392
01:34:46,256 --> 01:34:49,475
Oh, you know, just giving
myself some time off.

1393
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,261
We don't stand a chance
out there do we?

1394
01:34:53,285 --> 01:34:55,668
Two sub 30s.

1395
01:35:01,702 --> 01:35:03,341
What do you think her score is?

1396
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:09,587
I don't think she cares.

1397
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,433
It's a shame we didn't
get to finish it.

1398
01:35:18,774 --> 01:35:21,992
We could... finish it now.

1399
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:27,035
What if...

1400
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:30,408
we start over?

1401
01:37:18,096 --> 01:37:20,740
These are all for me. Right?

1402
01:37:20,764 --> 01:37:23,524
Don't tell my co-workers.
[laughs]

1403
01:37:23,548 --> 01:37:26,761
Oh, by the way, everything,
everything looks great here.

1404
01:37:26,785 --> 01:37:29,359
You know, I mean, you guys have
nearly perfect credit and EI

1405
01:37:29,383 --> 01:37:33,245
scores are just gonna make the
loan process go by so smoothly.

1406
01:37:33,269 --> 01:37:36,538
Do you have any experience
running a café?

1407
01:37:39,376 --> 01:37:41,383
We don't.

1408
01:37:42,324 --> 01:37:47,077
But we have someone in mind
who'd be perfect for the job.

1409
01:37:48,068 --> 01:37:49,318
