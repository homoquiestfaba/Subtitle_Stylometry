1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,400
Two suitcases ...

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,160
Two suitcases ...

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,520
I stopped everything.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,360
My books and my violin, 
 and the family ...

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
... the paintings, my tapdansschoenen ...

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,000
... and Aunt Selma's antique speeldoos 
 with a danseresje out.

7
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,040
And what happened then, dad?

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,280
We did not know what was happening. 
 We were away from our house.

9
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,360
I took the suitcases involved 
 to my first onderduikadres.

10
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,400
But I could but one night 
.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,200
I could not take them 
 to my next onderduikadres.

12
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,720
And then I buried them.

13
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,480
in the garden..

14
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,440
Is it not broken?

15
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
What do we want? 
 - Revolution.

16
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,320
How did you find him adorned 
 - With my innate charm.

17
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,960
We demand only one thing: 
 democracy at the university.

18
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,880
I must go. 
 - Do you hear him or not?

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
I have to my work. 
 - And the revolution then?

20
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,080
He talks about nothing else.

21
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,520
So what do we want? 
 - Action.

22
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Antwerp 1972

23
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,400
Two tongue and fifteen rijstpudding.

24
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Chaja, I will help you a hand?

25
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,360
It is here snikheet.

26
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
I assume dismissal.

27
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,240
Why?

28
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,800
No panic, no panic.

29
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,040
Chaja. Love your parents that you 
 visit.

30
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,240
Day, Mrs Goldblum.

31
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,640
Heerlijk to loving children 
 to have.

32
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,960
Not that I have them. Someone knew 
 not how you had to make.

33
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,440
Riepen you me, baby?

34
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Hello, child.

35
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,320
t last I have my complete series. 
 Is not it beautiful?

36
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,560
What are they beautiful.

37
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,640
Stamps. Hundreds of stamps, 
 thousands of stamps.

38
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,000
stamps for letters. 
 We never write letters.

39
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,000
I mumps if I agree in the three months 
 visit. I thought you were dead.

40
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,240
That is too tight jeans. 
 As you can krjgen of cancer.

41
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Wilde doctor but you are 
 Such beautiful work.

42
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,760
What do you do to philosophers?

43
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,440
I hear only about my own daughter 
 via Apfelschnitt sir.

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,240
Why do you want to go work 
 if you can live at home?

45
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,600
Hello, Mum.

46
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Hi, daddy.

47
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,360
Are you busy? 
 - Yes, very busy.

48
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,760
What is this? 
 - A book ...

49
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,680
Has he found at the flea market.

50
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I am at the flea market. 
 This is the house where I ...

51
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,840
I have a new recipe for cake.

52
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,400
JYou will do just the yolks. It is true 
 the protein and makes it later.

53
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,400
Many lighter. I only hope 
 that he firmly enough.

54
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Did you know? He likes but not on 
 with those letters.

55
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,360
He is the road all day and if he 
 come home, he begins to write again.

56
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
To whom?

57
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,240
On everyone. A variety of institutions. 
 Even to the mayor.

58
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,600
He is searching for belongings in the war that he 
 has buried. Two suitcases.

59
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,480
What do you mean? 
 - What does it? Let him anyway.

60
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,200
I mean the cake. 
 - Beautiful, mama.

61
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,680
Equally awesome as ever? 
 - Yes, just as awesome as ever.

62
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,600
I do not know. I think he 
 little too airy.

63
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,480
Dear Sirs, I do research 
 to the pre Antwerp.

64
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm looking for maps of 1940. 
 What should all this?

65
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Remember that your suitcases from the war?

66
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,080
I took them along to my first 
 onderduikadres.

67
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,760
I could just one night. 
 - I know, but ...

68
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,400
I could not take them, 
 and I buried them in the garden.

69
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,440
This is the house.

70
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,720
I remember those columns.

71
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,560
The address I do not know more, but I 
 buried them behind those bushes.

72
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,800
My books were in it, 
 and my old violin.

73
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
There is now only fungus 
 in the suitcases.

74
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,160
It was my old violin.

75
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,920
There was a speeldoos in 
 with a danseresje.

76
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,720
And a photo album and ...
- You tapdansschoenen, the silverware.

77
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,720
And other things. I do not know more 
 what, but they were important.

78
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,800
Why do you want them after all these years 
 search go?

79
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,680
I am not just when a thought.

80
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,160
After the war you had to go. 
 You did not want to fuss.

81
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,120
Then you could turn into a zoutpilaar. 
 But now I have found this book.

82
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,520
That district is completely gone. 
 There are only new buildings.

83
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,560
New buildings, but your father 
 but just not on.

84
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,120
He wants to demolish the whole town 
 for those suitcases.

85
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,280
Do you want soup, Chaja?

86
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,280
I have delicious chicken soup. 
 - Toe Well, mama.

87
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,640
what I get for you.

88
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,240
This is me, naturally enough 
 to the family.

89
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,840
You would they still want to see? 
 - Yes, hear.

90
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,800
ga Where you going? 
 - Return Home.

91
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,720
Why? No soup? 
 - I have the pressure.

92
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,600
Wait.

93
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
Ga never away without saying: 
 I love you.

94
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,080
I love you, dad.

95
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,320
Ga never on the door of an old man 
 over.

96
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,720
The next day he may have 
 not anymore.

97
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:48,400
What can I believe these old suitcases care. 
 He nag but about war.

98
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,720
I've tired of that Jewish 
 hassle, you understand?

99
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,120
Yes, but it is a pity. 
 - Why?

100
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,600
I've heard about a job 
 that perhaps what you.

101
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,120
If kindermeisje.

102
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,920
But it is a Jewish family. 
 - I hate Jews.

103
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,000
Jewish How are they?

104
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,720
very Jewish. They are chassidisch.

105
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,520
O, die. I ga not in the idiots.

106
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
It's only four days a week. 
 And it pays well.

107
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Never, never.

108
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,520
The capitalists have the power. Therefore 
 we must support the Communists.

109
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,240
Chaja, listen.

110
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,840
The revolution is important, do you?

111
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,480
Mrs. Leysen. Is it good 
 next week if I pay?

112
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
That you said last week al 
 - Next week I money.

113
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,720
That they can also last week al AIs you 
 tomorrow does not pay, you fly out.

114
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,760
Tomorrow ...

115
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,800
... I start my new job. 
 If kindermeisje to a wealthy family.

116
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,440
Are you sure? 
 - Yes, why not?

117
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,600
They are chassidisch. 
 These are extremely strict.

118
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,800
Women should not wear pants. 
 - I did.

119
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,800
Do you see clothes. 
 These are the 70s.

120
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,600
Geen wonder dat ze op straat
worden nagewezen.

121
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Maybe, but they do not complain.

122
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
She tolerated everything. 
 Spot, hatred, even disgust.

123
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,760
They're willing to pay that price 
 to himself.

124
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,920
I never come here. 
 - Sin You can make good kosher food.

125
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,320
I will never establish such a stupid wig.

126
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,040
Yes, if you run a chassid married.

127
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,920
About my corpse.

128
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,520
No cinema, no theater, 
 no radio, no television.

129
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,720
Not so much fun.

130
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,120
Linked refrain from what you below 
 understands.

131
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,840
Chaja, we are there.

132
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
Success.

133
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,400
Is somebody here?

134
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
What do you want?

135
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,560
The family Kalman.

136
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,080
Are you Jewish? 
 - And you?

137
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,520
Third floor.

138
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,280
The lift is out of service.

139
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,640
Very kind of you

140
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,400
I come to the job as kindermeisje.

141
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
Are you Jewish?

142
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,840
Hou You offered to the 
 - I'm not religious raised.

143
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,520
How old are you? 
 - Twenty

144
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,320
What work have you done? 
 - I'm studying philosophy.

145
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,760
Do you wear pants 
 to a philosopher?

146
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,200
Otherwise I get cold feet. 
 - Your mind is not in your knees.

147
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,800
According to the thora, a woman 
 do not dress as a man.

148
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,600
I thought the elevator was broken.

149
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,480
Lives nobody here? 
 - No, they want us away.

150
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,680
This is the kitchen, the nursery, 
 this is our room ...

151
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,640
... the Chamber of my husband. 
 Since nobody.

152
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,240
This is the living room 
 and that is the dining room.

153
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,440
These are Avrom and Dov. They go to 
 school, so you can see them for lunch only.

154
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Hello, Dov, Avrom. I'm Chaja.

155
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,040
These are Esva and Tsivja, my twins.

156
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,200
And that's Simcha. Simcha, come here.

157
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,440
And this is Simcha. 
 - Day, Simcha. I'm Chaja.

158
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,280
He can not talk.

159
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,440
Why not?

160
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,600
That's in God's hands.

161
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,200
Why do not you talk?

162
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,760
He plast still in his pants. 
 It stinks to herring.

163
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,120
Silent you. Ga to your room.

164
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,080
Why do not you talk?

165
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,280
My husband will think I mesjogge 
 am, but you can start tomorrow?

166
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,160
Can I think about it?

167
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,800
Okay, tomorrow.

168
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,760
Wake up.

169
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,280
Sta. Wake up.

170
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,000
Why are you so angry?

171
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,600
You have me awake until half past four 
 account of your political gezwam.

172
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,200
I had my speech for tonight 
 rehearse.

173
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,640
And I have to my work. 
 - That stupid bourgeois-job on you.

174
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,760
Eruit.

175
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,360
Wegwezen.

176
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,280
You've forgotten something. 
 - What?

177
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,840
You socks. You should wash them sometimes.

178
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
When I see you again? 
 - Never.

179
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Why? 
 - I hate men with stinksokken.

180
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,080
Okay, day.

181
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Day, Sofie.

182
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,360
Hey, even smell.

183
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,040
Do you like?

184
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,240
He is so boring. Even under the lovemaking 
 he talks about Karl Marx.

185
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,560
Sin.

186
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,400
Do the elevator close.

187
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,960
Hello Simcha.

188
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Do this about.

189
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,280
Linten? This is hip, say.

190
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,280
Hip? 
 - Trendy, fashionable.

191
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
We take them for centuries.

192
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
Ready.

193
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,440
That's my ball.

194
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,480
Simcha?

195
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,960
First the right leg, so the rules. 
 - My mistake.

196
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,080
He hears the know. 
 First the right leg, then the left.

197
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,080
Why?

198
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,520
You need the day with the good bone 
 begin

199
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,200
No, this is the room of my husband.

200
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
That is prohibited area. For us both.

201
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,360
And, what do I do?

202
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,720
That is the vleesfornuis. 
 - You should not boil milk.

203
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
Toe well, Chaja, be more cautious.

204
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,440
what are you doing?

205
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,440
I stop it.

206
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,840
Because of the rules? 
 Since wen you to.

207
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,000
I would not get used to. 
 I assume dismissal.

208
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,720
Chaja, it is the money? 
 - No, I ... I'm sorry.

209
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,800
Peter was desperate. He can his speech 
 not do without you.

210
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,880
Are you? 
 - No, I'm exhausted.

211
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,800
By your new job? 
 - My former job.

212
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,240
Here we go again. 
 New job, resign.

213
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,720
With men you just so. 
 - Do you hear her.

214
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,880
me is just about sex.

215
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,920
Nobody would cope with such a job. 
 Pure slavery.

216
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,640
You look grim. 
 - Thank you.

217
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,040
I ga. I do not want to miss this word.

218
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,320
Do the door shut.

219
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,960
I've had this yesterday accidentally 
 included.

220
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,800
I have now to college.

221
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,280
Come, Simcha. Let's go hiking.

222
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,720
Thank you.

223
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Outside service.

224
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Wait here, then I'll get you so.

225
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,480
You have it easy, Atilla. 
 Your legs z jn still good.

226
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
I have some pain. The blood flows 
 right to my feet.

227
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,040
That said the doctor himself.

228
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,360
Yes, he can easily talk.

229
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,560
Doctors, they sit all day on their 
 hole and still get well paid too.

230
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,800
But I do not.

231
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,960
From early morning until late at night 
 by the leg. And for what?

232
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,920
For a bunch of Jews.

233
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,840
And how long will that Jews ongoing 
 means with their baby?

234
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,400
They think that all of them. 
 - I must just like the children. alleen even de kinderen halen.

235
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,960
Did they against me 
 or monsieur le concierge?

236
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,000
Can I use the pram here 
 leave, monsieur le concierge?

237
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,400
That sounds all politely. 
 Do you not, Atilla?

238
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,560
Schoft.

239
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
Did you have something?

240
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,680
No, that was the dog. The poor beast 
 krjgt no word between.

241
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,160
This is Chaja, the new kindermeisje.

242
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,120
He may hand you do not give 
 according to the thora.

243
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,080
A man may only his own wife 
 touch.

244
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,840
I do not want that woman in my house.

245
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,120
You had to wait on me. 
 She is a poor woman.

246
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,280
I need help, Leibl. 
 I can not do it alone.

247
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Why not someone from our faith? 
 - That there is not.

248
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,760
She is there practically naked.

249
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,920
She is good with the children.

250
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,600
She is no better than a gomer.

251
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,480
Papa called her a gomer.

252
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,560
He has returned to his pants geplast.

253
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,800
In school, you do.

254
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,840
Will we go buy bread? 
 For the ducks.

255
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,400
These are ducks.

256
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,200
Can you say that?

257
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,880
You know what the duck say?

258
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,520
They say kwak-kwak. 
 Can you say that?

259
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,040
I think you understand everything I say.

260
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,040
Like your new job a little bit?

261
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,840
You will pay no more pants, I see.

262
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,000
What does gomer?

263
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,360
In the Bible is a gomer 
 a sinful woman. Why?

264
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,760
Great. He called me a whore.

265
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,680
Who? 
 - Mr. Kalman.

266
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,320
For him, every woman in miniskirt that.

267
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,960
Can I just proposals? 
 I'm Yakov Apfelschnitt.

268
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm an old friend of Chaja.

269
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,320
And how hot you?

270
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,920
He is four and he still does not talk.

271
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,720
Maybe he has nothing important 
 saying.

272
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,680
But a child should talk 
 by that age.

273
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,560
Rabbi Sem Malov, who is a genius 
 called ...

274
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,920
... spoke no word on his eighteenth.

275
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,920
But when he began to talk, 
 he knew the whole Bible from his head.

276
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,640
Simcha not do. 
 Soon you fall in the water.

277
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,120
In Selma, on the occasion 
 from her birthday.

278
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,040
Nice blouse, dearest. He'll be.

279
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,280
But you should really let your hair.

280
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,520
How do you find my hairstyle? 
 Yesterday get things done.

281
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,000
A new hairdresser. By Mrs 
 Goldblum. Try him again.

282
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,680
Maybe I do that.

283
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,080
They would have been 48 today.

284
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,120
It was her own decision.

285
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,480
She was so beautiful. And a good pianist.

286
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,080
An alcoholic, she was. 
 - After they returned.

287
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,960
Can we now eat our soup?

288
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,120
Hot chocolate. They did 
 the poison in hot chocolate.

289
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,400
What did they have to do? 
 Kippensoep?

290
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,360
They have five children.

291
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,960
One of them has red hair. Simcha.

292
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,560
He is such a baby, you would have him 
. With those funny slaaplokken.

293
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,680
Ready?

294
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,320
Why now?

295
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,320
Why on her birthday? 
 - Let the past rest anyway.

296
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,200
Do you want to bury the past 
 under a pile of cake?

297
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,520
Are you forgetting? They left you 
 seem to accumulate in Auschwitz.

298
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,000
Does. And you want to forget.

299
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,240
Forgotten. I would not talk about it, 
 and that you know.

300
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,320
A man is what he is 
 and not what he was 30 years ago.

301
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,560
Yes, but Selma is dead. She has so many 
 ago and you have no compassion.

302
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,120
And why? Because they are always there but 
 is talking about. Ever again.

303
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,400
Scream not. And your family? 
 Your father, your mother.

304
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,680
You never talk about. 
 Is this normal? Is this normal?

305
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,280
Is it normal to two old 
 suitcases to dig?

306
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,640
You with your cards and your books.

307
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,360
And but walk. The whole city, 
 as a crazy.

308
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,200
Rather an insane 
 like you do.

309
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,040
You make flight path. 
 You pretend nothing happened.

310
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm open.

311
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,400
You think that leaving the 
 because you do not want to think.

312
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,240
caketrommel I get back. 
 Then I can at least the door.

313
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,040
AIs I have a little time on stamps 
 hear, I killed him.

314
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,480
Chaja, look're still agree. 
 What a beautiful blouse.

315
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,920
You look beautiful. 
 Such a fine, warm family.

316
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,760
Keep the doors. 
 I am them to the polishing.

317
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,920
dirty Jews. They live in filth.

318
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,640
Mumps you that there is not even much more 
 about.

319
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,040
Good attention at school, boys.

320
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,760
Leibl, put some money down for Chaja. 
 It's payday.

321
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,200
Be nice to Mom.

322
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,040
Wait for me.

323
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,680
You can not. The floor is wet.

324
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,920
Alstubieft, the children are tired.

325
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,680
You hear that, Atilla? They are tired.

326
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,280
They are the whole afternoon in the park 
 and now they are tired.

327
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,960
And now they come with their dirty 
 pram by my clean swing.

328
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,360
What can we care? We let ourselves 
 not offend by that horror.

329
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,120
What did you say?

330
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,480
Oh, dear.

331
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,640
Will we see the trains go?

332
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,440
Look, we can take a picture. 
 Or is that also forbidden?

333
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,960
OK, we'll make a picture of your 
 as duck.

334
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,480
Look, duckling.

335
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,640
It is almost seven hours. 
 You would come back for four hours.

336
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,320
DThe concierge did not let us. Now snap 
 why I have moved the others.

337
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,480
Do not pay attention to him. Seven hours, 
 what a time to come home.

338
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,960
We know what we are against him 
 to say, hey Simcha.

339
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,240
Say something. 
 - They are hungry.

340
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,520
Mrs. Kalman, something he has said. 
 Go on, Simcha.

341
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,960
Help me out. Open the door.

342
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,880
He said "quack." Really.

343
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,080
Simcha, say 'quack-quack. "

344
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,720
spying on me?

345
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,800
out of the way, asshole.

346
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,680
Why are you doing this? It is pointless. 
 This is not it?

347
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,800
Yes, you're right. It was not.

348
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,560
I remember the river.

349
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,400
You think I'm an old fool, eh.

350
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:54,760
You're right, I'm an idiot. 
 I do not know what I got.

351
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,520
I feel cheated.

352
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,640
I think I begin to be old.

353
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,600
In four years he has never said anything 
 and suddenly he says' quack-quack. "

354
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,600
Very wisely, quack-quack What's there 
 more to say about life?

355
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,000
Especially if you are brought up. 
 Chassidim They are idiots.

356
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,640
What do you mean?

357
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,120
Their curls, their kaftan 
 and their stupid ideas.

358
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,720
What did you say to them?

359
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,960
Nothing, but they still live in ghettos 
 from the old Europe.

360
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,360
Hundreds of years of imprisonment 
 and humiliation.

361
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,040
They walk around in prison clothes 
 from that time. Why?

362
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,920
Watch me. I Wear 
 clothes from the prison camp?

363
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,760
The ghetto walls are cases and 
 those pious chassidim build them again.

364
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,720
I gotta go. Simcha wait.

365
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
What is that? 
 - A secret.

366
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,520
A gift for me?

367
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,960
Do not leave without saying: 
 I love you.

368
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,120
I love you, Daddy.

369
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,080
I love you. I do love you.

370
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,760
You know what I'm going to do?

371
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,120
I am of that army buy tickets. 
 Many detailed.

372
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,040
I have a gift for you.

373
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,840
Would you open it?

374
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,880
Duck.

375
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,960
Wheel.

376
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,960
Nose.

377
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,640
Lamp.

378
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,880
Simcha.

379
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,680
What is that thing?

380
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,920
He said something.

381
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,000
He speaks, he speaks.

382
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,760
Framework, boiler, table ...

383
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,960
... shoes, duck, quack.

384
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,120
Leibl, guess what. It is a miracle.

385
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,840
The elevator is out of service. 
 I had to climb all those stairs.

386
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,120
This is also caretaker never 
 If you need him.

387
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,000
Wat is dat?

388
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,280
A miracle. Leibl, listen.

389
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,000
Wait, wait.

390
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,200
Let him now. He is fond of. 
 - I do not want such a toy in the house.

391
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,440
You learn nothing.

392
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,480
Simcha can talk, sir Kalman.

393
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,800
It's true. You've heard it yourself.

394
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,280
He has a lot of words. 
 Listen, listen.

395
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,200
Simcha, say something. Say 'duck'.

396
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,160
Duck. Talk, Simcha.

397
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,880
You heard him "quack" say? 
 Kwak-quack.

398
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,280
My son says "quack" while he 
 would have to say his prayers ...

399
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,320
.. and the four questions 
 during the seider.

400
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,280
Duck, wheel ...

401
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,640
Come on, Simcha.

402
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,960
I pee in my pants.

403
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,480
The four questions for the seider 
 I teach them you, it's easy.

404
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,040
Chaja, I can not.

405
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,440
Of course it does, you have another two weeks.

406
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,720
Why should I learn this?

407
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,280
Because you should ask your father 
 to the seider.

408
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,560
And if you're father ...
- I am a duck.

409
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,880
Then you duck the first Orthodox 
 with red sofa and a lure Keppel.

410
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,120
What is going on? 
 - We make clean for Pesach.

411
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,480
All breadcrumbs have gone. 
 No yeast with Pesach.

412
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,800
How you doing, honey?

413
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,640
I will not pee in my pants, huh? 
 - No, do not worry.

414
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,760
They should to the kitchen

415
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,960
They need not to the kitchen.

416
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,440
Eight days Pesach.

417
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,400
I would lie on the ground 
 and eight hours sleep.

418
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,200
There must be done so much for tonight.

419
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,000
m And a man I have nothing.

420
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,760
He not only sells chocolate, 
 he thinks chocolate.

421
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,200
Fortunately sold Moses no chocolate.

422
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,080
Then we had the Promised Land 
 never met.

423
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,200
Take your children 
 to the park?

424
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,320
I they can not now have on the floor.

425
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,200
Will I come tonight to help? 
 Or is that also forbidden?

426
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,320
Would you do that? It is not prohibited. 
 Not with Pesach.

427
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,640
What's here?

428
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,920
Get your hand away, then I can read.

429
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,560
There is "quack-quack-quack."

430
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,640
Am I?

431
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,840
What do you think of the new decorations?

432
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,400
Awful.

433
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,160
I see them as primitive schideringen 
 from troglodyte ...

434
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,360
... that too little language 
 for a simple call.

435
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,480
And how are you exercises, 
 Simcha sir?

436
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:16,920
Excuse me ... I have to tell you. 
 Stinksok is here.

437
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,400
You let no grass grow on.

438
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,520
Do you mind?

439
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,800
No, you can have him.

440
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,480
Are you going out?

441
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,880
Yes, eating.

442
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,800
Do you have a boyfriend?

443
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,280
Good for you.

444
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,960
Are you going to swim tomorrow? 
 Or is it very late tonight?

445
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,440
No, my friend should go to bed early.

446
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,560
And now, Simcha ...

447
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,160
Come on, Simcha.

448
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,680
He can not.

449
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,960
But I do.

450
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,440
Good, Simcha.

451
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,840
Very good, Simcha.

452
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,600
But you made a mistake 
 in the first question.

453
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,160
You said 'matses eat. " It must have 
 'eat only matses. " Tell me.

454
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,760
It is not fair.

455
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,240
Why do so? 
 He has practiced in weeks.

456
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,120
Would you ask her to stop?

457
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,600
No, I take it for your son. 
 It is not fair to him.

458
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,280
Send her away.

459
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,080
No, I am not going away.

460
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,760
Then I go.

461
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,040
Chaja not do.

462
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,120
Leave this room immediately. 
 - No.

463
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,360
How can you treat as your son?

464
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,640
These are the rules. And under my roof 
 you respect my rules.

465
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,200
I respect your rules, 
 and your faith.

466
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,000
But your religion has no respect 
 for others.

467
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,000
Why you called me a Gomer? 
 Because I am otherwise? Me dressed differently?

468
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,760
Leave this room. Now.

469
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,480
I understand you do not. Dares you not 
 to keep your son?

470
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,480
These are my late father 
 and my little brother.

471
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,400
They were my eyes hung 
 in the camp.

472
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,160
We should all watch.

473
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,200
You know why they were 
 hanged?

474
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,720
Because they refused the refugee problem 
 to spit and curse God.

475
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,520
And you dare me to say 
 I have no respect?

476
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,440
My god ...

477
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,520
He seems to Simcha.

478
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,240
Excuse me.

479
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,960
Please ...

480
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,760
Go now.

481
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,760
Excuse me.

482
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,920
Please ...

483
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,280
How Stinksok?

484
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
Boring.

485
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,400
And your new friend? Are you in love?

486
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,320
Is he cute?

487
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,080
How old is he? 
 - Four.

488
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,400
Four?

489
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,080
He has red hair. He is so sweet 
 with its small slaaplokjes.

490
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,520
Slaaplokjes?

491
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,280
They are chassidisch 
 - Oh, those guys. Creep.

492
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,280
What do you mean, 'freak'?

493
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,040
Well, with those weird clothes from them.

494
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,160
That's just their pregnancy.

495
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,800
I had my mother not 
 play with Jews.

496
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,720
O no?

497
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,560
Are they not very 
 goj that you are?

498
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,800
I'm not goj. 
 - O no?

499
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,280
I'm Jewish 
 - You look out not Jewish.

500
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,320
Is that a compliment?

501
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,080
Excuse me. But you got me 
 never told.

502
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,440
Your father has still not that lure.

503
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,360
The Jews are talking to itself 
 to thank. They do not adjust to.

504
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,480
Fit? Or they adapt 
 or not, they were killed anyway.

505
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,520
You know what I mean. 
 - No.

506
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,800
Excuse me.

507
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,320
Excuse me.

508
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,280
Are you still mad at Dad?

509
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,840
And Dad on you?

510
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,880
Are you with us? 
 - Sure, honey.

511
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,640
Well, I will you finally learn 
 the liftdeur close to doing.

512
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,000
Chaja, my hand.

513
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,840
Simcha racing.

514
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,600
You've torn my uniform. 
 - Racing.

515
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,640
Jewish pig. What do you do?

516
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,760
This is not my job. 
 - Is children sometimes hurt your work?

517
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,680
You've torn my uniform. 
 You have to pay.

518
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,640
You have to pay me.

519
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,360
Mrs. Kalman.

520
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,320
You never believe it. 
 - What is it?

521
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,720
He wanted to hurt my hand. 
 - Who?

522
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,600
He wanted to hurt my hand. 
 - Who?

523
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,480
The concierge. He is a fascist.

524
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,840
Does it hurt? 
 - No.

525
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,960
He was able to break him. 
 He threw the liftdeur so close.

526
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,400
He is common. 
 - He always cries.

527
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,320
You can not let go of your hand.

528
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,160
My husband talk with him later 
 He is afraid of my husband.

529
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,440
But we can make him angry. 
 - Why not? That Bastard.

530
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,200
He comes to children and called us 
 dirty Jews.

531
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,200
Swearing does not hurt. 
 - You must fight back.

532
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,080
No, let's drink tea.

533
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,880
But it is wrong.

534
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,400
Is his coat really broken?

535
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,800
Yes, and I pay him. 
 I still prefer to go dead.

536
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,040
We can not rejoice 
 about the fall of our enemy.

537
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,600
But there is nothing that we have him 
 up to help.

538
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,160
Thank you for what you've done.

539
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:06,080
This uniform must be paid. 
 The franc is your 1500 costs.

540
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,560
You have already to another?

541
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,880
Sure. I got two. 
 One in the laundry.

542
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,720
Well, then I go to the landlord 
 in Brussels.

543
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,920
Well, then I go to the landlord 
 in Brussels.

544
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,560
Chaja, I would not be bothered. 
 - That krjgt But you do.

545
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,160
The landlord is already looking for an excuse 
 to all of you on the street to throw.

546
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,640
Tell him I've torn your coat 
 because you are one of the tenants attacked.

547
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,160
It was a joke. 
 - Just kidding? His hand was almost broken.

548
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,120
He does nothing wrong. And I?

549
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,360
You have my uniform in rags 
 torn and you'll pay for it.

550
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,440
I have people behind me. 
 An entire organization.

551
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,080
Chaja, we pay it.

552
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,800
No, that will not hog cent.

553
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,800
None cent.

554
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,400
Do you take orders from your staff? 
 - Give me a break.

555
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,040
One more word about that stupid 
 uniform ...

556
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,960
One more word about that stupid 
 uniform ...

557
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,040
What did you say? Open up.

558
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,120
I demand respect.

559
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,840
Get sorry.

560
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,840
I got a uniform for my work.

561
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,920
How else they know who I am?

562
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,240
I can not do my work 
 without uniform.

563
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,760
Ik kan m'n werk niet doen
zonder uniform.

564
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,080
None cent.

565
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,160
Day.

566
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,240
You can not.

567
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,560
I'm doing the cleaning.

568
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,840
You can sleep here. 
 - I go home when I want.

569
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,000
Ik vraag geen toestemming
aan die vuile fascist.

570
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,480
I ask no permission 
 to that dirty fascist.

571
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,640
Why not? I will not let me lock.

572
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,960
And the kids? 
 You give them a bad example.

573
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,640
Maybe it's a good example. 
 - Off 'window climbing and break your neck?

574
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,000
No, stand up for yourself.

575
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,480
I think they are right. 
 - Me too.

576
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,600
Come off.

577
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:49,520
Do not. It is dangerous. 
 What are you still stubborn.

578
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,200
The Bible is full of strong women. 
 Good afternoon, everybody.

579
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,000
Chaja, please do not break your neck.

580
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,280
Nope.

581
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,120
May the Almighty protect her.

582
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,320
I did it.

583
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,280
Excuse me, sir. Jews also live here?

584
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,440
If you see someone that another 
 attack ...

585
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,800
... it is your duty to him 
 to stop.

586
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,520
If necessary by force.

587
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,800
concierge who has geboft 
 so good that he came from.

588
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,200
I just came to you.

589
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,400
Maybe you can better today 
 not come. The whole week.

590
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,160
Why?

591
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,440
The concierge is still blazing. 
 About a week he calmed down.

592
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,600
The concierge is still blazing. 
 About a week he calmed down.

593
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,480
We pay your course. 
 And next week you can begin again.

594
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,320
You would not leave his chest?

595
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:16,520
It is better for a week 
 truce to hold.

596
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,400
It is no truce 
 but a capitulation.

597
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,000
Simcha, come on.

598
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,640
Go to your mother.

599
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,600
And who then execute the ducks? 
 - That is what other people do.

600
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,800
How long is a week? 
 - A little night sleep.

601
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,360
never go away without saying: 
 I love you.

602
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,920
I love you.

603
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,680
I love you.

604
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,800
You come but once in the six 
 or seven weeks.

605
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,920
I do not understand why you still do.

606
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,400
Or you wonder whether we are here 
 still live?

607
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,200
save you the trouble.

608
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,840
If we move, I send you 
 a moving map.

609
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,560
Come on, Mom. 
 Look, I have flowers for you.

610
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,240
Thank you.

611
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,560
What do you mean?

612
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,040
blanket, as the Indians NAVAHO 
 made.

613
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:55,000
She wove them tightly so 
 that they are waterproof.

614
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,600
What do you have a waterproof blanket 
 need? It is not raining inside?

615
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,040
You never know.

616
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,600
Want a slice of cake? 
 I got it made for Goldblum.

617
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,040
Where's Daddy? 
 - He has today started digging.

618
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,640
God knows where.

619
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,840
He is so changed, so bitter.

620
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,760
Sa I go find him?

621
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,160
He is so determined that these suitcases 
 to find.

622
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:42,480
Even if he can find them, 
 he will not be happy.

623
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,960
He thinks his luggage will return 
 what the war has destroyed.

624
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:56,320
Berlin, his mother, his father.

625
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,240
Selma.

626
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:05,320
He has not lost his suitcases 
 in which rotoorlog but himself.

627
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,040
As we all.

628
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,400
We are lost people.

629
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:22,480
Oh, my god. He stands there with 
 a temperature of 30 degrees ...

630
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,320
... to dig themselves.

631
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,720
She is gone.

632
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,600
My wife. She is gone for good.

633
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,440
We have had a quarrel this morning.

634
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,360
You make a fight for 25 years.

635
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,520
She was not there when I came home.

636
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,600
Hates You know what they had 
 to my stamps.

637
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,000
That she had even 25 years.

638
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,440
Come look.

639
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,040
Look, look.

640
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,480
She must have run all day 
 lick and paste.

641
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,840
Maybe they are back.

642
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,960
You need at least a nice new wallpaper.

643
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,160
Hello. There's visit.

644
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,160
These are my wife and my daughter.

645
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,680
Good afternoon.

646
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,480
Your husband was a pit at the graves 
 on private land.

647
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:12,520
He said he was looking for two pieces of baggage. 
 Two suitcases from the war, is not it?

648
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,120
We will not do more, huh. 
 Otherwise, we must take action.

649
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,480
Antwerp is not a sandpit.

650
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,200
If everybody just goes graves, 
 there is just nothing left.

651
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,280
We have to take your shovel.

652
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,160
Is that real?

653
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,640
Yes, the agents can scoop 
 better take.

654
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,480
Thank you for giving my husband 
 home has brought.

655
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,240
Goodbye, sir.

656
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,640
Do you want a slice of cake? 
 - No, thank you

657
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:51,080
Let me give you a piece for the road. 
 Just one.

658
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:02,760
Do you know what John F. Kennedy actually 
 said when he said: LCH bin ein Berliner?

659
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,080
Yes, I know.

660
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:12,280
I am a donut. 
 Ein Berliner is a donut.

661
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:17,440
he had to say: LCH bin Berliner.

662
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,440
But he told 
 the whole world: --

663
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,600
I am a donut.

664
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,720
Oh, my boy. My poor son.

665
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,440
I do not know what to do.

666
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,200
Take a bath, pull clean clothes on ...

667
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:51,040
... drinking a cup of coffee and I give you 
 a delicious slice of cake.

668
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,120
That is not to say.

669
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,960
I do not know what I should 
 with my life.

670
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,160
Tomorrow you go chess.

671
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,200
And I go back weaving. 
 As we have always done.

672
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,200
Sir Apfelschnitt.

673
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,960
I get a glass of water for u.

674
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,280
I just wanted to go Kalman. 
 The truce is over.

675
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:22,520
An old uncle of mine taught me 
 to never bring bad news ...

676
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,720
... without a bit of good news.

677
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,920
The good news is that your father 
 weather is going chess.

678
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,280
He sent me four times reports.

679
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,720
The bad news is 
 that Simcha Kalman dead.

680
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,400
Did you hear me?

681
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,920
Did you hear me?

682
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:25,560
He drowned in the pond 
 in the park.

683
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,440
Friday.

684
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,400
His mother picked him ...

685
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,560
... but he was gone.

686
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:41,040
And yesterday, on the Sabbath, 
 they found him in the pond.

687
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,280
When I was on my bench in the park Saturday ...

688
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,000
...came two firemen 
 in diving suits to the pond.

689
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,440
When I heard who they were looking for ...

690
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,480
... I stayed.

691
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,840
There is a whole crowd gathered, 
 mainly gojim.

692
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,680
They have a nose for trouble.

693
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:36,640
His father was there all morning 
 been with a few chassidim.

694
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,200
Even the rabbi was there.

695
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,320
Friday was Mrs Kalman ...

696
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,880
him search in the park.

697
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,640
And she took his toy in the water.

698
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,680
duckling on wheels.

699
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:06,760
His father stood in the pond 
 and held the toy in his hands .

700
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,200
... as if the child so he could retrieve it.

701
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,080
Why did you come?

702
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:23,560
Have you no decency? 
 No respect for the dead?

703
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:30,320
Nobody wants to accuse you, 
 but you're not really welcome here.

704
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,280
accuse Me?

705
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,520
Simcha You took it every day 
 to that pond?

706
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:43,400
child, barely four years old, 
 that could not even swim.

707
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,960
True or not?

708
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,800
Simcha You took it, 
 he so alienated from his parents.

709
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,720
How could you do that?

710
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,960
Speak not. We must look 
 for the will of the Almighty.

711
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,520
You can better go now.

712
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,360
No

713
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:19,800
Many daughters of Israel have 
 been brave ...

714
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,840
... but you have surpassed them all.

715
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,920
You still get money from me.

716
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,160
It is a pity the little boy.

717
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,880
I wished him no harm again.

718
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,080
I just wanted him to learn a lesson 
 the liftdeur. It was the principle.

719
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,680
This work is not easy, you know.

720
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,880
went past it, but my legs 
 do the very last time around.

721
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,200
The blood flows to my feet. 
 It said the doctor himself.

722
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:26,760
You're just as guilty as the water, 
 the trees or the ducks in the pond.

723
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,160
Those were his accomplices to death.

724
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,760
The water because it did nothing else 
 than embrace him.

725
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,520
Trees unemployed because they were watching.

726
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:41,360
And the ducks because he was lured 
 by their croak.

727
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,960
And you, Chaja ...

728
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:49,040
You did all you could do.

729
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,120
You loved Simcha Kalman.

730
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,840
This is wrong.

731
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,440
I'm sure, 
 it is totally wrong.

732
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,840
This is not the right place. 
 - It is not wrong.

733
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,080
You have not read the map.

734
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,360
I read all cards before 
 you were born.

735
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,120
Look, this is the right place. 
 It must.

736
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,760
Here was the house ...

737
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,400
And when we arrived ...

738
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,760
From the right, and when we turned around. 
 - No, we came from this side.

739
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:06,080
When we went to the right. 
 - Yes, but then left.

740
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,400
We never find them. 
 - We find them.

741
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,880
All we need very Antwerp 
 spade.

742
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,800
Please, Chaja ...
- on, dig.
