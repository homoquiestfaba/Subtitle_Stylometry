1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:04,549
(whirring)

2
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:10,221
(triumphant music)

3
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:19,163
- Then Captain Kickboxer
disables the death ohm

4
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,861
with a gut cruncher!

5
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:23,100
(upbeat indie music)

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,750
Captain Kickboxer sees his chance.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,573
A flying Dutchman kick to the neck!

8
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,540
(shouts)

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,010
- What is going on here?

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,649
You're gonna be late
for your first lesson.

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,523
Oh, what a mess, Dad told
you to clean up last night.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,240
Now don't step on the seats.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,530
- Clean your room,
don't step on the seats.

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,043
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

15
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,140
(indie rock music)

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,707
So what is this kickboxing teacher like?

17
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:52,060
- (sighs) You'll be fine.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,590
- But what if I don't get it?

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,040
- You'll get it.

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,803
Then you can be a real kickboxer,
like Captain Kickboxer.

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,277
- If you say so.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,930
- Go get them, champ.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,070
- YOu're not coming with me?

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,310
- I'm the king, I can't
go back to the basics

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,300
with squirts like you.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,520
You'll be fine.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,700
- Yeah, kickboxing rocks.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,650
- Don't let Master June kick your butt.

29
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,000
(melancholy music)

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,160
- Check out all the combat gear.

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,220
- I know, it's pretty neat stuff, huh?

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,520
- Oh, excuse me, do you
know where Master June is?

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,310
- June, place looks great.

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,820
Really done a lot with it.

35
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,430
- [June] Thanks.

36
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,452
- Now about those private lessons.

37
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:28,860
(phone rings)
Ah, fudge.

38
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,693
Sorry.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,633
Yeah?

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,993
Yeah, I understand, I'll be right over.

41
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,583
I gotta go.

42
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,390
I'll see you tonight?

43
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,970
- Tomorrow night?

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,803
- Tonight.

45
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,870
Tomorrow night, all right.

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,260
See you.

47
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,093
That was good.

48
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,118
(thumping dance music)

49
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:52,497
♪ Yo baby, yo baby, yo baby ♪

50
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:55,219
♪ Yo baby, yo baby, yo ♪

51
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:59,379
♪ Getting hot, baby, hot, yo, boy ♪

52
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,436
♪ Who's the man with an answer ♪

53
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:06,370
♪ Baby, M.J. ♪

54
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,680
- What's up with this DJ, man?

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,850
I was just starting to get into the music.

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,750
- I don't know, Stan, I kinda like it.

57
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,820
- What are you doing, butt wipe,
those are my dad's records.

58
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,779
- Chill, babe, I think Crillo makes this.

59
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,696
- Put the records back.

60
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,141
Get out of my face.

61
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:33,054
- Hey dude, I think she digs me.

62
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,630
- Looking for Danny?

63
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,533
- No.
- Yes you are.

64
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,470
Hey, check it out.

65
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,600
- Hey there.

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,433
- Melinda.

67
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,360
- Melinda, it's your lucky day today.

68
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,670
I'm gonna let you go home with me tonight.

69
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,970
- Me too.

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,980
- Excuse me?

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,558
- Don't wet yourself,
sweetheart, you can come with us.

72
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:57,808
(laughing)

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,563
- They want us.

74
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,034
(gentle music)

75
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:17,010
- I don't know why I attend
functions like those.

76
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,210
- Me neither, the girls
are always stuck up.

77
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,962
- [Chet] Come on, let's pound these dorks.

78
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,063
- [Treck] Yeah.

79
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:28,063
(suspenseful music)

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,140
- Hey look, guys, just
like the nature channel!

81
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,788
A beached whale!

82
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:35,988
(laughs)

83
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,155
(yelping)

84
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:42,307
(grunting)

85
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,502
(groans)

86
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:12,521
(inspiring music)

87
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,650
- When we were kicking butt,

88
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,230
taking no names, let alone prisoners,

89
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,347
back in combat, it was great.

90
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:26,427
There was nothing quite like shooting down

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,141
unarmed men with powerful submachine guns.

92
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,891
(mimics gunfire)

93
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,030
But enough about me.

94
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,880
It would be very unrealistic of me

95
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
to expect you yellow-bellied
street gang rejects

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,080
to live up to my example, so
hit the mat and give me 20!

97
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,680
- Sir, yes, sir!

98
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,050
- I told you to call me Captain.

99
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,870
- Yes, Captain, sir, yes, Captain, sir!

100
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,520
- Hit the mats, piss ants!

101
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,288
(grunting)

102
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:19,540
- Hm, losers joining the competition.

103
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,993
Chet, Treck, get your
sad fannies over here.

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,433
At ease.

105
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,933
Take a look over there.

106
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,610
- Hey, I know those two.

107
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,310
- Yeah, we were gonna kick their butts,

108
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,440
but somebody came out of nowhere,

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,010
nailed me with a roundhouse.

110
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,560
- A roundhouse, eh?

111
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,650
Did you kick him in the nards?

112
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,800
- Well, not exactly.

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,620
- I told you, always take out their nards!

114
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,453
- Yes, Captain!

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
- I want you both to go over there

116
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,510
and teach those spunk
monkeys they're going

117
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,590
to the wrong kickboxing school, capisce?

118
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,930
- Ca-what, sir?

119
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,814
- Nevermind, do what I said.

120
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,481
(ominous music)

121
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,010
- Gee, I don't know about this, Stan.

122
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,780
- Relax, let's at least check it out.

123
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,253
- [Barry] If you say so.

124
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,551
- I think you girls
are in the wrong place.

125
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:16,800
I mean, the ballet school's
right down the street.

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,890
- Look, guys, we don't want any trouble.

127
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,814
- You're gonna get a lot
more than that, fat boy.

128
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,814
(suspenseful music)

129
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,890
- Hey guys, leave him alone.

130
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,560
- Who's gonna make him, you, fat boy?

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,110
- I think you two should leave.

132
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,800
- What are you, their mother?

133
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,723
- Oh, mother.

134
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,130
- Oh, I can see you
two aren't very bright,

135
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,520
so I'm gonna let you walk
out of here unscathed.

136
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,568
Or are you two here to sign
up for the beginner's class?

137
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:45,480
(chuckling)

138
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,540
- Beginner's class?

139
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,810
- Beginner's class. (guffaws)

140
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,483
- That one's to fan the
air, next one's for real.

141
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,610
- Captain says it's okay
to beat up on girls, right?

142
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,443
- Let's do it.

143
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,030
(grunting)

144
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,902
(groans)

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,260
- [June] Consider that
a free lesson, boys.

146
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,160
- Tres magnifique.

147
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,240
- Farfegnugen.

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,073
- If you two care to sign up,

149
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,740
I've got a two for one special.

150
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,410
- Really, how much would that cost?

151
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,917
- Shut up, Treck.

152
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,950
You haven't seen the last of us.

153
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,230
None of you have!

154
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,230
(suspenseful music)

155
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,570
- Those are some of the
more advanced techniques

156
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,940
you'll be learning later.

157
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,853
Now let's start with the basics.

158
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,554
(classic country music)

159
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,920
- Purrs like my girlfriend.

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,840
- Listen, kid, I'm
paying you to change oil

161
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,010
on other people's cars,
not diddle with your own.

162
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,810
- I'm a craftsman, not a diddler.

163
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,470
Anyway, I gotta go pick up my
babe from kickboxing class.

164
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,303
I'm out of here.

165
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,770
- So what's up with you and Brian?

166
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,230
You pretty much ignored him at the party.

167
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,150
- I don't know, I'm not sure
what I wanna do right now.

168
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,440
- [Melinda] Hang on a
second, I have to get a towel

169
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,460
for my hair.

170
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,920
- You're taking a shower
before kickboxing class?

171
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
- You never know who you might meet.

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,300
- You are such a tramp.

173
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
- You got that, girlfriend.

174
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,410
So do you want me to pick
you up on my way to class?

175
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,200
- No, Racer X is picking me up.

176
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,270
- If you wanna let him down easy,

177
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,620
why don't you just tell
him he has to choose

178
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,480
between you and the car?

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,525
- Good idea.

180
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,180
(horn honking)
There he is.

181
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,470
I gotta go, bye.

182
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,303
- Okay, bye.

183
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,280
- So babe, you're going with me

184
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,890
to the car show Saturday
night, aren't you?

185
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,730
- I don't know, Brian.

186
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,180
- What do you mean, you don't know?

187
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,620
Of course you are.

188
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,920
I'll pick you up at eight.

189
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:26,585
(bell chimes)

190
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,062
- Hey Danny.

191
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,980
- Hey Cindy, how's it going?

192
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,073
- She's doing great, aren't you, babe?

193
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,883
- I'm fine, thanks for asking.

194
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,310
So you're not coming to class anymore?

195
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,160
- I really don't have the time.

196
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,150
Besides, I was just
doing it for the goofs.

197
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,817
- You're pretty good for a goof.

198
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:01,572
(melancholy music)

199
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:17,632
(speaking foreign language)

200
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,882
(shouting)

201
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,800
- Hey, these guys are pretty good.

202
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,423
- I bet I'll be doing this
after one or two lessons.

203
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,880
- Now remember, although
you know the moves

204
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
and progressions,

205
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,000
you must be able to change
and manipulate what you know

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,210
to suit any situation.

207
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,960
A reed that does not bend will break.

208
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,850
We don't want any broken
reeds in this class.

209
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,725
Brian, come on up.

210
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,660
- Uh oh.
(mimicking chicken)

211
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,933
- Not to worry.

212
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:02,193
(tense music)

213
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,270
- You know the techniques,

214
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,570
but you're not flexible with them.

215
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,350
You must have balance.

216
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,570
Even if you don't have time
to get into your stances,

217
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,250
balance is key.

218
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,783
- We could handle that, balance.

219
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:16,053
- Balance my butt.

220
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,340
- Step right up, boys!

221
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,909
Get your very own genuine
imitation of the real thing,

222
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,650
Walkdude radios!

223
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,960
Listen to all the bad tunes you love

224
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,050
right in your very own ears!

225
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:34,010
(foreboding music)

226
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,010
Yo babe!

227
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,443
Those boots were made for knocking.

228
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,003
- Check it out!

229
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:02,253
(thumping dance music)

230
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,065
(shouts)

231
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,130
- Whoa, I gotta calm down, dude.

232
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,600
- [Tarbeck] Are you sure
she's gonna be here?

233
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,650
I think she likes me.

234
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,900
- Yo, city honcho!

235
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,610
Wanna buy a Walkdude?

236
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,493
- Yeah, right.

237
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:30,657
- How about you, comandante?

238
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,983
- Degenerates.

239
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,790
- I know I am, but what are you?

240
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,913
- Watch it, punk.

241
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,914
(shouting)

242
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,173
Hello, June.

243
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,680
How's the little daycare
center these days?

244
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,248
- What do you want, Tarbeck?

245
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:57,223
- Just a friendly visit.

246
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,740
You know, babe, you and
me should get together

247
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,410
for some social commingling.

248
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,630
A little cerebral combat, if you will,

249
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,020
a little horizontal kickboxing--

250
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,970
- Shut up, Tarbeck!

251
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,993
June.

252
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,310
I came to give notice personally.

253
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,810
You're out of here at
the end of the summer.

254
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,230
- What do you mean, I'm out of here?

255
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,630
What have you got to do with my lease?

256
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,530
- I have controlling interest in the bank

257
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,793
that holds the deed on your property.

258
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,970
I'm gonna see to it that
your lease is not renewed.

259
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,860
- Of course, when I take over,
I might need an assistant.

260
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,648
- Over your dead body, Tarbeck.

261
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:35,560
- You know, I've got an idea.

262
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,290
I'm gonna give you a chance
to win back your lease.

263
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,180
Your students against his in a contest

264
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,500
at the end of the summer, winner take all.

265
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,180
- I thought you said--
- Winner take all.

266
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,690
Tarbeck, if your kids
can't beat the daylights

267
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,720
out of this sorry bunch of losers,

268
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,213
you deserve to stay in that strip mall.

269
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,170
- I'm gonna enjoy this, Brian.

270
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,630
With Danny gone, you're gonna
be my little punching bag.

271
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,783
- Oh I can handle you.

272
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,940
- Don't worry, girls, it's
gonna be quick and painless.

273
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,490
- You mean like your love life?

274
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,794
- See you later, class,
get ready for pain.

275
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:21,627
(ominous music)

276
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,890
- Why are you giving them a chance?

277
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,265
Why not just take away their lease?

278
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:25,520
- What's the matter, Tarbeck, worried?

279
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,910
- No, of course not.
- A little humiliation

280
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,150
is good before defeat.

281
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,840
You saw that class,
they're a bunch of losers,

282
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,010
just like her.

283
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,650
Work out the details,
I'll have papers drawn up.

284
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,300
It's good to settle old accounts.

285
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,890
- Captain Tarbeck's Academy.

286
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,551
Pain and cruelty.

287
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:47,594
- Yeah.

288
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:49,204
Bet you.

289
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,360
- Those guys are such jerks.

290
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,830
Who do they think they are anyway?

291
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,530
- If those bozos want
a fight, they got one.

292
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,500
- Melinda, you dated that
Treck guy once before, right?

293
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,333
- No way.

294
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,040
All right, maybe just once.

295
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,980
- It's a good thing we're
just beginners, huh, Barry?

296
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,330
Looks like we won't have to fight.

297
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,860
- Not so fast, you two.

298
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,780
Beginners fight in competition, too.

299
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,430
At least one of you will compete.

300
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:22,850
- Am I interrupting?

301
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,173
- No, Cindy, come on in.

302
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,560
Can't even tell you how many
students have been through here

303
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,863
in the past 50 years.

304
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,773
- That's Brian's dad, isn't it?

305
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,160
- Yep.

306
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,383
- How old were you when
Master Hung adopted you?

307
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,216
- A few months.

308
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,790
He liked to think that he
was teaching kids a lot more

309
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,180
than martial arts.

310
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,830
He'd say the ones that were
taught to handle trouble

311
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,040
were the ones that could avoid it.

312
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,860
Now I've gone and landed
this place in more trouble

313
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,810
than he could have imagined.

314
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,810
- How do you figure?

315
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,030
- I've spent a lot of money,

316
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,063
renovating, expanding the building.

317
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,920
Took out a loan against the academy.

318
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:05,225
(gentle music)

319
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,033
- You think he'll come back and help?

320
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,540
- Maybe.

321
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,590
But we'll be ready to do this on our own.

322
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:20,672
(indie rock music)

323
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,910
- Here's my buy 10, get
one free Miami Subs card,

324
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,570
all filled out.

325
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,120
- Yep, looks like you get
a free fatty beef deluxe.

326
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,450
Boy, he must've been hungry.

327
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,030
- Let me see that.

328
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,259
- What's up?

329
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,300
- Do you know anybody
named Mike Shortsaretight?

330
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,150
- No.

331
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,083
- Hugh Dickhead?

332
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,240
Jaun Hunlow?

333
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,560
- Doesn't ring any bells.

334
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,750
- Gee, that's funny,
'cause they're the guys

335
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,110
that signed this card for this
free hamburger, you fat dip.

336
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,270
- Well how was I supposed to know?

337
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,230
- It's covered in the employee manual.

338
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,410
This hamburger is coming
out of your paycheck.

339
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,310
- That's not fair.
- Hey!

340
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,570
If you don't like it,

341
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,170
take it up with the regional supervisor.

342
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,993
Now get back to work.

343
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,250
- Hey, I know you, the beached whale.

344
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,595
- You must have me confused
with some other whale.

345
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,570
- Oh no, you're the douche.

346
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,960
Chet tells me you've
joined the competition.

347
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,930
- Oh, you mean the kickboxing academy.

348
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,427
Yeah, I was just there checking it out.

349
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,510
Didn't like it, it sucked.

350
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,103
- And don't you forget it.

351
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,653
Now, get me a double bacon
cheese fatty, you fatty!

352
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,436
♪ Won't waste my time
shifting foreign gears ♪

353
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,353
(indie rock music)

354
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:15,798
- All right, 12's unstuck now.

355
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:18,348
(growls)

356
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:19,450
Told you to wait 'till
I was out of the lane,

357
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,283
you little jerk!

358
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,230
I could deal with customer service

359
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,750
if the customers weren't all such pigs.

360
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,780
- Rough night?

361
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,810
- All I know is this is my last summer

362
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,180
working here for my dad.

363
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,352
Then he coughs up for a new
sports car, and it's guy city.

364
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:36,602
(chuckles)

365
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,003
Hey!

366
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,982
It only takes tokens.

367
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:46,065
Tokens.

368
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,540
Spay and neuter your pets,
that's all I have to say.

369
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,010
- You're mean.

370
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,560
- Let's go to my car, I
need to get league posters.

371
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,357
(foreboding music)

372
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:18,370
- Hey.
(whistling)

373
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,680
- Ooh, a man who can whistle.

374
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,547
Pinch me, I must be dreaming.

375
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,380
- Pinch you, baby.

376
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,180
- It's okay, I was only kidding.

377
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,640
- Ooh, how can you resist?

378
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,210
- Come on, he's even wearing cologne!

379
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,200
- Stop right there, I mean it.

380
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,673
- We're so scared.

381
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:33,776
(suspenseful music)

382
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,026
(grunting)

383
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,897
- Ow, my ass.

384
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,793
These girls are wicked.

385
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,297
Ow, my ass.

386
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,661
- I'm out of here!

387
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:29,810
- Go ahead, Jean Claude.

388
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,870
- Thanks, Danny.

389
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,690
- It looks like you had the
situation under control,

390
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,410
I was just finishing them off.

391
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,670
- You were just goofing, right?

392
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,503
- Yeah, goofing.

393
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,720
- Did you hear about the big match we have

394
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,294
against Tarbeck's class
at the end of the summer?

395
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,160
- The way you handled those guys,

396
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,694
it doesn't look like you'll
have too much trouble.

397
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:46,920
- You know, we could use your help.

398
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,490
- Yeah, well you'll be all right.

399
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,470
I'm gonna go back inside, all right?

400
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,443
I'll see you later.

401
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,300
- Thanks, Danny.

402
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,263
- Yeah, thanks.

403
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:05,054
(phone rings)

404
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,300
- Fatal Combat, this is Tarbeck.

405
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,790
- [Max] Yeah, is Bill there?

406
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,830
- Bill who?

407
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,200
- [Max] Bill your mother
for last night. (cackles)

408
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,310
Later.

409
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,143
- Mommy?

410
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,683
Punk kids.

411
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,847
(triumphant music)

412
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:34,200
- Aw yeah, there it is,

413
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,020
the king daddy thrash.

414
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,120
Aw yeah, I will have it.

415
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,490
- If you win the world
thrash board championship,

416
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,480
you could afford it.

417
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,820
- I know, that's why I got
my new job as a messenger.

418
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,290
The tournament charges a
hefty wad to get in, dude.

419
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,929
- Broken down, man.

420
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:52,925
- Yeah.

421
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:55,508
(upbeat music)

422
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,800
(ominous music)

423
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,093
- Hey Jason, nice skateboard.

424
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,320
- Thanks.

425
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,740
- Give me that!

426
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,320
- You wanna read my
Captain Kickboxing comic?

427
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,233
- No, I wanna tear it in half,
then steal your skateboard.

428
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,710
(tense music)

429
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,996
I'm gonna get you, punk!

430
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,579
Now I'm pissed off!

431
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:38,286
(gentle music)

432
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,273
- Hiya.

433
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:05,510
- That's not how I taught you to keeya.

434
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,000
You can do better than that.

435
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,370
- Maybe I don't want to.

436
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,290
- Why not?

437
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,870
Should always wanna do your best.

438
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,867
- I'm not so sure about this
kickboxing thing anyway.

439
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,510
- Now what does that mean?

440
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,182
- Well this kid just jumped me,

441
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,160
and there was nothing I could do about it.

442
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,260
Then he stole my comic book.

443
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,433
- Oh he did, did he?

444
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,820
Well I might have to
take some serious action.

445
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,000
I may have to teach you
some of my secret moves.

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,527
- Really?
- Really.

447
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,490
But you gotta promise me one thing, okay?

448
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,500
- Okay, anything, what?

449
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,200
- I need you to compete for the school

450
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,680
in the junior lightweight
division at the end of the summer.

451
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,050
- Okay, but you better
teach me those moves

452
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,530
pretty darn quick.

453
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,363
- Okay.

454
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,810
(coughs)

455
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,210
What are you two doing here?

456
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,363
You here to practice?

457
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,120
Well your next class isn't until tomorrow.

458
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,780
- Well actually, after some
serious soul searching,

459
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,180
some self-actualization through
hypnosis and meditation,

460
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,430
tell her, Barry.

461
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,090
- As Stan was saying--

462
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,040
- You're quitting.

463
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,860
- Yeah, we're quitting.
- Yeah, we're quitting.

464
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,320
- I was counting on one of you to compete

465
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,233
in the beginner's division
against Fatal Combat.

466
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:18,960
- Well Master June, my, my...

467
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,763
Tell her, Barry.

468
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,940
- His hemorrhoids have been
flaring up and he can't compete.

469
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,090
- Fine, then I guess
it's up to you, Barry.

470
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,870
Well, to be honest with you, Master June,

471
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,940
I don't think I could be ready in time.

472
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,720
Plus me and Stan are
kind of a one-two combo.

473
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,260
- I see, so--

474
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,610
- If you're both quitters, we
don't need you here anyway.

475
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,210
- Hey, you be quiet, kid.

476
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,760
- Barry, let's get out of here.

477
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,473
- That was kinda mean,
what I said, wasn't it?

478
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
- What do you think?

479
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,850
- Den mother, psychiatrist,
and kickboxing instructor

480
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,953
all rolled into one.

481
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,000
- Comes with the territory.

482
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,460
- There's gotta be an
easier way to earn a living.

483
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,610
- Oh I'm sure there's an easier way,

484
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,562
but there's no other way for me.

485
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:19,562
(upbeat rock music)

486
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,233
(grunts)

487
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,670
- Work on that, or you'll
be scrubbing the latrines.

488
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,618
(groaning)

489
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,390
- How am I doing, Captain Tarbeck?

490
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:01,465
- Good, Treck.

491
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,108
- Have you secured the enemy's head?

492
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,780
- Yes, Captain!

493
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,270
- Do you remember what to do next?

494
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,380
- Elbow to the ribs!

495
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,544
(grunts)

496
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,785
What next?

497
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,893
- Sucker punch.

498
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,906
(shouts)

499
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,773
Good work, Chet!

500
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:36,213
You're really getting the hang of this.

501
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:37,297
- Thank you, Captain.

502
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:40,410
- You know, you'll be representing
the Fatal Combat School

503
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,243
in the black belt contest

504
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:43,587
against those Kickboxing Academy wussies.

505
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,587
- All right!

506
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,310
- You will be fighting Brian.

507
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,590
Maybe one of those
Kickboxing Academy chicks.

508
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,140
See who the real men are!

509
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,740
They'll be yours for the taking.

510
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:57,499
(shouts)

511
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,999
(phone rings)

512
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,600
Fatal Combat, Tarbeck coming at you.

513
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,070
- [Maddox] How are your students doing?

514
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,523
- Well, great, Mr. Maddox.

515
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,070
- I just wanted you to
know that if your main guy

516
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,280
isn't up to it, I have
access to a secret weapon.

517
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
- I'm sure there'll be no need for that,

518
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I trained all my boys personally.

519
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,740
- Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.

520
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,240
Just keep in mind what I said.

521
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:30,603
(foreboding music)

522
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,073
- [Cindy] This is Cindy,
I'm not home right now.

523
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:38,039
Just leave me a message,

524
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,964
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.

525
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:40,797
Bye.

526
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,363
- Ow!

527
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:48,410
- [Stabile] What has got into you, Brian?

528
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,130
- Nothing, just hurt my thumb.

529
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,920
- Something on your mind today?

530
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,410
- I'm fine!

531
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,090
- Just seemed like something
was eating on you, that's all.

532
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,170
None of my business.

533
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,003
- It's nothing.

534
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,350
It's just that I had this date with Cindy

535
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,990
to go to the car show, and now
I can't get her on the phone.

536
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,063
- I didn't know Cindy
even liked cars that much.

537
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:08,943
- Are you kidding, she's nuts about them.

538
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,230
- Pedro took a message for
you about two hours ago.

539
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,880
I think it was Cindy.

540
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,713
- What?

541
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,873
Damn, why didn't she
tell me this yesterday

542
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:23,800
when I asked her?

543
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,770
- I'm gonna go to the show with a couple

544
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,710
of my car club buddies if
you'd like to tag along.

545
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,860
- Thanks, but you're supposed
to go to these things

546
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,693
with your babe.

547
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,723
- Life's rough, kid.

548
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:36,703
- [June] It's a nice place.

549
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,873
- What?

550
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:39,706
Oh yeah.

551
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,060
It's just a meager attempt to impress you.

552
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,480
Sounded like you had a tough week,

553
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,223
I thought maybe a night out
relaxing might do the trick.

554
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,347
Hm?
- Is everything all right?

555
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,163
- No, the wine.

556
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,820
I don't know, it's a little off.

557
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,160
Do me a favor, sport, will you?

558
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,010
Bring me another bottle, same year.

559
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,193
- Yes, sir.
- Please.

560
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,233
Trust me.

561
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:18,468
- Okay, awkward pause.

562
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,883
- Well I wanted to tell you something.

563
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,723
June, when I'm with you,

564
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,920
everything seems to just fade away.

565
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Just deals and clients and contracts,

566
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,760
all that stuff.

567
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,980
It's not important, gone.

568
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,623
Don't laugh, don't laugh.

569
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:46,720
I'm not kidding.

570
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,210
When I'm with you, it's like we're alone

571
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,003
on a deserted island, just you and me.

572
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,005
(phone rings)

573
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,653
Somebody's.

574
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,180
Sorry, I thought I...

575
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:12,430
I'm sure I left it in
the car, but I didn't.

576
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,263
Excuse me.

577
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,313
Yeah?

578
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,880
I know, okay, bye.

579
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:31,023
Have I mentioned recently
how beautiful your eyes are?

580
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,720
- [Man] Party on, dude, cool.

581
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,260
- You know, I heard the
first time you do it,

582
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,650
it should be with someone
who knows what they're doing.

583
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,600
- That makes sense.

584
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,190
But I think you should be with somebody

585
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,553
that you really love.

586
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,470
That really loves you.

587
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:55,553
- Whatever. (giggles)

588
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,260
- I wanna know more about your dad.

589
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,300
What'd he do next?

590
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,110
- When his boss at the button
factory went home for the day,

591
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,770
he'd hold kickboxing
lessons in his office.

592
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,070
It's how he saved up for the academy.

593
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,903
- Mm.

594
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:16,530
You know what, I've had a
wonderful time tonight with you.

595
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,080
- Well next time, you should
get a table for three.

596
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,873
- Three?

597
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,613
- Me, you, and your friend the telephone.

598
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,480
- Sorry, I...

599
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,760
Wait a minute, you did
say next time, right?

600
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,040
- Yes.

601
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,873
- Good.

602
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:35,123
Good, you won't regret it.

603
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:40,205
(suspenseful music)

604
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:42,053
- Hey!
- Hey!

605
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,303
(grunting)

606
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:36,050
(shouts)

607
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:47,018
(groaning)

608
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,904
- Get outta here.

609
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:53,154
Get outta here!

610
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,550
Amateurs.

611
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,383
- What was that all about?

612
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:57,770
- I have no idea.

613
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,870
Friends of yours?

614
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,450
- No, are you okay?

615
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,390
- Yeah, nothing like getting
kicked on a full stomach.

616
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,180
- Yeah, well next time we
get attacked, remember,

617
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,370
I'm the kickboxing
instructor, you're the lawyer.

618
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,500
- Be my guest.

619
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,080
You fight, I'll sue for damages.

620
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,567
How much you think I could
get for a broken ego?

621
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:18,408
(gentle music)

622
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:39,134
- Danny?

623
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:40,233
Danny, is that you?

624
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:41,730
- Oh.

625
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,563
Hi, Cindy.

626
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:45,700
- What the hell are you doing out here?

627
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,600
- Until you showed up, I was sleeping.

628
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,948
- Danny, you're sleeping on
the dirt out by the beach.

629
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:52,781
- It was the only place I could think of,

630
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:53,873
given the circumstances.

631
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,010
- Trouble with your dad?

632
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,160
- You'd think a 52 year
old man would conk out

633
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,403
after a case of beer.

634
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,260
I hope I have the energy
to throw a coffee table

635
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,860
through a wall when I'm his age.

636
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:09,095
- You could've called me.

637
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,583
- Maybe last year.

638
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,650
Anyways, I thought you lost interest.

639
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,703
- What do you expect?

640
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,900
The way you took off after,

641
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,430
after the accident during
the kickboxing competition.

642
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,600
- Accident?

643
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,655
I nearly killed that guy.

644
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:26,705
- It was an accident.

645
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,220
Besides, I didn't hear
from you for months.

646
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,520
What was I supposed to do?

647
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,240
- It doesn't matter anyways.

648
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,687
I don't fight anymore and
you're seeing someone else.

649
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,187
- I'm not too sure about that.

650
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,230
Brian and I, he's a
nice guy and everything.

651
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,643
- Do you remember that time

652
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:51,580
that we stayed up all
night talking on your roof,

653
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,033
and I almost fell off,
and your dad heard us?

654
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,270
- I remember, he called the cops.

655
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,103
- Yeah.

656
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,663
Does that seem like a long
time ago to you or what?

657
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,083
- Yeah, and no.

658
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,573
- Cindy.

659
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:13,331
- What?

660
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,767
- I don't know, it's you and me,

661
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,580
and it's been a long time.

662
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,210
- Shut up.

663
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,043
Kiss me.

664
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:47,406
(whirring)

665
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:49,906
(phone rings)

666
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,267
- Damn falling products.

667
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,220
Tarbeck here.

668
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,825
- [Max] Hi, is Al there?

669
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:57,658
- Al?

670
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,657
- [Max] Yeah, I'll kick your big old butt

671
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:02,040
if you don't stop crapping on my lawn.

672
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:09,778
(whirring)

673
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,367
- Hey, you brought my new skateboard.

674
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,867
(tense music)

675
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:56,464
(clucking)

676
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,893
If I catch you, you're dead!

677
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:14,750
- Are you okay, Jason?

678
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,940
- Oh, hi, Master June.

679
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,289
Just doing some training exercises.

680
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:23,230
- Oh, well I don't even know those moves.

681
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,139
You'll have to show me sometime.

682
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,806
(ominous music)

683
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,610
- I can't believe it!

684
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,630
- Aw man, those jerks are gonna pay.

685
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,390
- We can't be sure who did this.

686
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,350
- No offense, but we
all know who did this.

687
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,520
I mean, come on.

688
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,180
- What are we gonna do now?

689
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,370
Our tournament with those pigs
is less than a month away.

690
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,950
- I say we go down there
and give them a taste

691
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,180
of their own medicine.

692
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,060
- They'll be ready for it.

693
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,600
I bet they're even counting on it.

694
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,820
- I guess that's it, then.

695
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,830
- That's what?

696
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,263
- If you mean quit, no way.

697
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,128
Even if we have to practice at the beach.

698
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,128
(upbeat rock music)

699
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,894
♪ I got a girl ♪

700
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:46,727
♪ Her name is Sue ♪

701
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,920
- Master June, under the circumstances

702
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,950
and the marginal propensity
that does succeed to exist,

703
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,950
assuming no physical liability,
I would say Barry and I

704
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,120
would think there would be no
better time than the present

705
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,270
to re-engage in some...

706
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,850
Tell her, Barry.

707
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,280
- Doctor said the best thing
for hemorrhoids is kickboxing.

708
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,330
- So you wanna be let back in class, huh?

709
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,440
Usually don't take back quitters.

710
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,590
- We didn't so much quit as we did--

711
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,160
- According to the medical situation,

712
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,400
which was bordering on critical,
if you know what I mean,

713
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,170
and I think you do.

714
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,000
- Don't make any presumptions.

715
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,480
- We mean we quit, and we're sorry.

716
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,013
- And we wanna know if we
can get back into the class.

717
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:37,820
(mellow rock music)

718
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,610
- I just remembered how much
I hated playing pool with you.

719
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,830
- Yeah, I guess the old maestro

720
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,394
could still teach you a few things, huh?

721
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:45,970
- You never know, Danny.

722
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,102
Maybe I can teach you a
few new things now, too.

723
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,176
- Are we talking about pool?

724
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,583
- Pool, life.

725
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,486
You oughta come down to the beach

726
00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:57,622
and watch us work out sometime.

727
00:41:57,622 --> 00:41:59,622
- What, Baywatch meets Enter the Dragon?

728
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,780
- I'm talking about kickboxing.

729
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,283
- Kickboxing, life.

730
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,320
Hey, I wouldn't mind help
fixing up the academy.

731
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,347
- We're doing fine without you, Danny.

732
00:42:10,347 --> 00:42:13,264
(foreboding music)

733
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,590
Hey Cind, haven't been able to reach you

734
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,900
on the phone lately, and I
can't get more than two words

735
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,053
out of you in class, and here you are.

736
00:42:35,473 --> 00:42:37,420
- Brian, are you drunk?

737
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,130
- Whoa, cute, smart, and psychic.

738
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,690
- I try to talk with you,
Brian, you just never listen.

739
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,340
- I never listen?

740
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,060
I never listen?

741
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,670
Who's the one who fixed your carburetor

742
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,300
after you described the
funny noise it was making?

743
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,640
- Brian--
- You were stranded on I-95.

744
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,387
You called me up in tears,
and your exact words were,

745
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:58,900
"Caboodly plank, ka-per, ka-plank."

746
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,710
- Brian--
- And I knew, why?

747
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,830
Because I listened.

748
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,930
- Brian, will you shut up and let me talk?

749
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,140
This is just what I mean,

750
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,300
I can't finish a sentence with you.

751
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,840
It's always we're going
here, we're going there.

752
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,943
You never stop and find
out who I really am.

753
00:43:13,943 --> 00:43:16,310
- Oh, and I guess Mr.
run away from everything

754
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,020
James Dean of the pool hall does.

755
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,393
- Yeah, he does.

756
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,250
Brian, you're a nice guy and
everything, I just think that--

757
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,150
- I know what you're trying to do.

758
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,550
You think you can just come back

759
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,150
and everything will be the same.

760
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,340
Just go back to your boozer dad.

761
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,107
The Kickboxing Academy doesn't need you,

762
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:36,523
and my girlfriend doesn't need you.

763
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,290
- Cindy's right, you don't listen.

764
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,880
- Brian, maybe we should just talk later.

765
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,830
- No way I'm leaving you here with him.

766
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,610
- Maybe we should just leave.

767
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,810
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

768
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,470
- She's not leaving with you, loser.

769
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,820
- I don't wanna fight you, Brian.

770
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,680
- I know you think you're a bad boy,

771
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,220
but I'm no punk like that kid
you hurt in the competition.

772
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,492
- I'll see you later, man.

773
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:02,492
(suspenseful music)

774
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,277
(grunting)

775
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:25,784
(indie rock music)

776
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:45,417
(upbeat country music)

777
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:48,334
(punchy pop music)

778
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,560
- Brian, are you okay?

779
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,252
- Who needs you?

780
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:57,669
Who needs anyone?

781
00:44:58,694 --> 00:45:01,611
(foreboding music)

782
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:09,290
- Hey Brian.

783
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,433
Is boozing it up part of
the academy's program now?

784
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:15,792
Ew.

785
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,540
- I guess barfing on your car

786
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,920
is part of the program, too, Brian.

787
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,880
- Does the term projectile
vomiting mean anything

788
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,893
to you guys?

789
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:33,002
(foreboding music)

790
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:36,985
(upbeat pop music)

791
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,325
- I could tell you a story,
would make your skin crawl.

792
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:00,520
(gentle piano music)

793
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,353
But I won't.

794
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,293
Actually, this bottle come a long way.

795
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,680
And it belonged to somebody

796
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,790
who's no longer with us,

797
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,420
but that's neither here nor there.

798
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,330
What's important is us.

799
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,680
We're here.

800
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,233
64, great year.

801
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,063
To new beginnings.

802
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:30,830
Toast?
- New beginnings.

803
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,640
(phone rings)

804
00:46:47,756 --> 00:46:49,620
- [Maddox] Carl, have you
got the paperwork ready?

805
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,220
I'm gonna see to it that full ownership

806
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,327
of the Kickboxing Academy--

807
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:53,160
- What?

808
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,050
Jerk.

809
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,967
(upbeat pop music)

810
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:03,863
(ominous music)

811
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:10,323
(tires screeching)

812
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:26,144
(banging)

813
00:47:32,398 --> 00:47:34,981
(solemn music)

814
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:23,580
- All right, class, let's take a breather.

815
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,130
I have an announcement to make.

816
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,160
Brian's not gonna be competing

817
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,290
in the tournament against Fatal Combat.

818
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,590
Pierre's gonna be taking his
place in the black belt round.

819
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,950
- But I just moved up to
black belt last month.

820
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:34,783
- I wouldn't let you compete

821
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:36,540
if I didn't believe you could do it.

822
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,500
- Gee, Cindy, what happened
between you and Brian?

823
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,380
- I told you already, I had
to talk to him sometime.

824
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,476
I just didn't know he'd get drunk.

825
00:48:43,476 --> 00:48:45,610
- You really know how to
drive your men over the edge.

826
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,030
- That's not funny.

827
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,270
- I was just kidding.

828
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,200
- When did Brian talk to you?

829
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,993
- Actually, his parents called me.

830
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,050
You haven't heard?

831
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,510
- Heard what?

832
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,940
- Brian was in a car accident last night.

833
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,563
He's hurt, he's in the hospital.

834
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:04,431
(somber music)

835
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,910
- Captain Kickboxer backs away

836
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,900
from Deathwarden's
giant mechanical menace.

837
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,373
The robot's visor emits
a potent death ray.

838
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,500
- Hey bro, could you leave us
alone for a couple minutes?

839
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,010
- Sure.

840
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,497
If you wanna read this, here you go.

841
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:30,140
You better be nice to him,

842
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,040
otherwise you'll have to answer to me.

843
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,983
- Listen, Brian.

844
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,652
I just wanted to say that I am so--

845
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:43,160
- It's all right, Cindy.

846
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,667
It's not your fault.

847
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,360
(gentle music)

848
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,710
I've had some time off lately,

849
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,070
and I've been doing some thinking.

850
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,870
- Brian--
- And I just wanna say

851
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,363
that maybe I haven't
been listening to you,

852
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:00,910
and taking you into consideration
like I probably should've.

853
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,100
Stabile at the garage is always asking me

854
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,803
why I spend so much time there.

855
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,510
Told you to keep out, you little creep!

856
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,833
Anyway, when I had such
a beautiful girlfriend,

857
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:22,519
I guess I know why he wondered.

858
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:26,831
What I'm trying to say,

859
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:30,683
no hard feelings?

860
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,893
- Thanks, Brian.

861
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,040
- I'm not sure I can
get used to seeing you

862
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,593
with what's-his-name.

863
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,610
- He's not so bad once
you get to know him.

864
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,620
- So who's taking my
place in the tournament?

865
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,253
- Pierre.
- Pierre?

866
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:59,090
He's a nice guy, but he's not
me, if you know what I mean.

867
00:50:59,201 --> 00:51:01,927
- Well right now, Pierre's all we got.

868
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,470
- So do you really think
that showing us slides

869
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,070
of your combat days are gonna help us

870
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,840
against the Kickboxing Academy tomorrow?

871
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,140
- Chet, sucker punch.

872
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,340
(shouts)

873
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,600
I wouldn't have shown them to you

874
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,950
if I didn't think they
would help, now would I?

875
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,000
Yes, Soupy?

876
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,290
- I don't understand.

877
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,840
- Soupy, sucker punch yourself.

878
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,202
(shouts)

879
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:36,768
(phone rings)

880
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,870
Fatal Combat, Tarbeck here.

881
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,640
- Are you ready for tomorrow?

882
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,690
- We've been ready for weeks,

883
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,700
and we've seen to it
that their main combatant

884
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
will be watching from the sidelines.

885
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,020
- Get ready for another roster change.

886
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,750
- [Tarbeck] You want us
to take out someone else?

887
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,830
- You're replacing Chet
with another fighter.

888
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,380
- But you, we can't do that!

889
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,780
- You can and we will.

890
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,320
I have a secret weapon.

891
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,610
- It's just that we can handle this

892
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,320
by ourselves, Mr. Maddox.

893
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,220
- Tarbeck, you couldn't handle
toilet paper by yourself.

894
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,630
It's a done deal, bye.

895
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,253
(dial tone beeps)

896
00:52:12,253 --> 00:52:14,920
(ominous music)

897
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:19,317
- He doesn't know who he's dealing with.

898
00:52:21,844 --> 00:52:24,094
(laughing)

899
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,960
- [Thug] Check it out, Captain
Tarbeck's getting a wedgie.

900
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,529
(foreboding music)

901
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,633
- Danny.

902
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,170
What a pleasant surprise.

903
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,580
- Yeah, well Cindy told me about
this place getting trashed,

904
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,700
and I thought I'd stop by,

905
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,280
see if I could help out or anything.

906
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,430
- The only thing we need help with

907
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,430
is the competition against Fatal Combat.

908
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,850
- I can't really help you there.

909
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:05,320
You know as good as anybody,
I can't fight anymore.

910
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,620
I almost killed somebody.

911
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,360
- Danny, I'm gonna tell you a secret,

912
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,590
something none of my other students know,

913
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,320
but I think it can help you.

914
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,410
- Well shoot.

915
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,710
- I was nine years old
when I first competed.

916
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,780
Studying under my father,

917
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,240
I was especially anxious to please him.

918
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,973
My opponent, a nine-year-old little boy,

919
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,340
died right in front of me.

920
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,093
I swore I'd never compete again.

921
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,720
Week later we found out it
was congenital heart failure,

922
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,700
nothing to do with the competition.

923
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,560
I still wouldn't fight.

924
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,610
Then my father taught me
the most important lesson

925
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,996
of my life.

926
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:39,970
- What was that?

927
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,230
- You have to put the past
behind you or it blocks your way.

928
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,340
Your opponent recovered fully.

929
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,465
It's time you do the same.

930
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:50,298
(uplifting music)

931
00:53:56,753 --> 00:53:59,610
- I have to say, I underestimated Brian.

932
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,843
For once, he seemed to
understand, or at least try to.

933
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,773
- Well that's good, no sour grapes.

934
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,490
- Yeah, so sour grapes.

935
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,140
Whatever that's supposed to mean.

936
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,780
Brian wants you to take his place

937
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,590
in the tournament tomorrow.

938
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,390
He thinks you're the only
chance we've got, and so do I.

939
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:21,710
- What, are you guys ganging up on me?

940
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,490
Pierre has it under control.

941
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,890
- You're better than him and you know it.

942
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,723
He knows it.

943
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,483
- I'm just not a kickboxer.

944
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,253
- Well then just do it for goofs.

945
00:54:35,197 --> 00:54:37,067
Or do it for me.

946
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:39,650
(serene music)

947
00:54:55,699 --> 00:54:58,532
(inspiring music)

948
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:14,706
- The king has arrived.

949
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,260
So, do you come around here often?

950
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,445
(mellow lounge music)

951
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:39,695
(sniffing)

952
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:46,190
Whoa, dude, why don't you
just shoot us next time?

953
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,810
- I didn't do it.

954
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,060
- Yeah, right.

955
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,060
This fine, bodacious babe
certainly isn't guilty.

956
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,247
(dinging)

957
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,663
Whoa, I have got to lay off those nachos.

958
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:13,106
(chatting)

959
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,393
Hey dude.

960
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,170
- You ever heard the words excuse me?

961
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,550
- No.

962
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,383
- No?

963
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,650
Pay attention.
- All right.

964
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,980
- Address is on the outside, all right?

965
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,643
You make copies, and
you file the originals.

966
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,870
Get out of here, man.

967
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,340
Where were we?

968
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,878
Oh yeah, come in here.

969
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:44,711
(whimsical music)

970
00:56:57,946 --> 00:56:59,263
- Oh check this out.

971
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,723
Transfer of ownership.

972
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,233
I better talk the guy from
the academy about this.

973
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:10,000
But it's too far.

974
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,200
I'll never make my
skateboarding tournament.

975
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,890
All right, all right.

976
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,453
Major decision time.

977
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,363
Do I become world thrash board champ,

978
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,793
or do I help my friends?

979
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,997
- Ladies and gentlemen,
before we get started,

980
00:57:32,997 --> 00:57:34,646
please welcome an exhibition

981
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:37,646
by the Okinawan Shuri-ryu sensation,

982
00:57:38,527 --> 00:57:41,517
Armando the noodle Ramos.

983
00:57:41,517 --> 00:57:43,767
(cheering)

984
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:50,411
(suspenseful music)

985
00:57:55,345 --> 00:57:56,660
- What's in the bag?

986
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,070
- Rub down oil, extra briefs,

987
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:02,170
ginseng tablets, computer baseball.

988
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,200
Oh, and three tuna sandwiches.

989
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,145
Want one?

990
00:58:05,145 --> 00:58:07,562
(applauding)

991
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,340
- Looking forward to joining
the ranks of the unemployed?

992
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,440
- In my office last night I
saw an old tournament photo.

993
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,810
Reminded me of how sad my
father was when a young man died

994
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,760
at the academy at the start of a match.

995
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:27,615
A match against me.

996
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,150
- I don't need to hear this.

997
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,350
- It was congenital heart failure.

998
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,940
I've never forgotten,
and I know you haven't.

999
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,670
But hurting me and hurting my students

1000
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,063
isn't gonna bring your
son back, Mr. Maddox.

1001
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,980
- I meant what I said before, June.

1002
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,510
When I take over your school,

1003
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,593
there'll always be a
position for you under me.

1004
00:58:58,252 --> 00:58:59,581
(bell rings)

1005
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:02,430
- Welcome to Bayside,
where two longtime rivals

1006
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,590
are here to meet once again.

1007
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:08,080
The School of Fatal Combat
and the Kickboxing Academy.

1008
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,170
There will be four matches.

1009
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,870
- So do you think he's gonna show?

1010
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:15,100
- I hope so, he didn't say.

1011
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,690
- We'll be fine without
him, right, Pierre?

1012
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,573
- Yeah, fine, I hope.

1013
00:59:18,573 --> 00:59:21,350
- But before we get on
with the competition,

1014
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:25,290
allow me to introduce you to
the sponsor of the competition,

1015
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,578
Mr. Charles Maddox.

1016
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:29,995
(applauding)

1017
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:40,077
And now for the junior competition.

1018
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,330
Competing for Fatal Combat,
coached by Reeve Tarbeck,

1019
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,167
is Jam Winowski.

1020
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,584
(applauding)

1021
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,570
Competing for the Kickboxing
Academy, coached by June Hung,

1022
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,063
is Jason McMurphy.

1023
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,570
- Remember the secret moves.

1024
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:15,070
- And remember, a cheap shot
is better than a rabies shot.

1025
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,753
- Yeah, Coach, got you covered.

1026
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:24,978
(bell rings)

1027
01:00:24,978 --> 01:00:26,318
(speaks foreign language)

1028
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:29,318
(suspenseful music)

1029
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:33,542
- Kick!

1030
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,216
- Right, sucker punch!

1031
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:45,337
(cheering)

1032
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,614
- Point!

1033
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:49,447
- One point, Winowski.

1034
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,080
(grunting)

1035
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,390
(cheering)

1036
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,223
- Point!

1037
01:01:05,169 --> 01:01:07,769
- One point, McMurphy.

1038
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:09,436
- Don't got nothing.

1039
01:01:10,776 --> 01:01:13,026
(grunting)

1040
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:25,479
Yo, Jason!

1041
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,992
(cheering)

1042
01:01:30,992 --> 01:01:32,302
- Point!
(bell rings)

1043
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:33,854
- All right, all right, all right!

1044
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:38,687
- [Announcer] Point and match,
Jan Winowski, Fatal Combat.

1045
01:01:40,622 --> 01:01:43,100
- Yay, I won, yeah!

1046
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,500
- Yay, you're just lucky

1047
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,191
your coach helped you from the sidelines!

1048
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:48,608
Now sit down, get outta here.

1049
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,187
- All right!
(whooping)

1050
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:54,797
- Are you okay?

1051
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:55,940
- He cheated.

1052
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,397
- I know they cheated,
but I'm very proud of you.

1053
01:01:59,397 --> 01:02:01,180
(bell rings)

1054
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,110
- Next up, the beginner's division.

1055
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,180
For the Kickboxing Academy, Stan Slovski.

1056
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:10,590
(applauding)

1057
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:11,883
- Hey, Slovski!

1058
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:14,450
Why don't we put you in a round room

1059
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,307
and tell you there's a
cheese danish in the corner?

1060
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:19,474
(guffaws)

1061
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:23,143
(chattering)

1062
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,797
- Representing Fatal
Combat, Marion Gitler.

1063
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,930
- Marion Gitler?

1064
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,353
We don't have any chicks on our team.

1065
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,891
- That's you, cabana boy.

1066
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:40,391
- Oh, oh, oh yeah.

1067
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,953
- Come a long way, Stan,
I know you can do it.

1068
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,920
- Wish I was going with you, buddy.

1069
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:53,040
- What a dork.

1070
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,883
- He's no beginner.

1071
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,780
He is no beginner,

1072
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,550
I've seen him practicing
with Tarbeck before.

1073
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,210
- [Judge] He has all the
appropriate paperwork.

1074
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,110
Mr. Maddox has cleared him personally.

1075
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:15,289
(bell rings)

1076
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:17,640
- And this time, I'm gonna
beat your fat whale butt

1077
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,887
for good!

1078
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:20,076
(speaks foreign language)

1079
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:22,247
(grunts)

1080
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:23,687
- Yes!

1081
01:03:23,687 --> 01:03:24,618
(cheering)

1082
01:03:24,618 --> 01:03:26,255
- [Announcer] Point, Gitler.

1083
01:03:26,255 --> 01:03:28,902
(laughs)

1084
01:03:28,902 --> 01:03:30,111
(foreboding music)

1085
01:03:30,111 --> 01:03:32,278
(jeering)

1086
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,390
- Come on, son.

1087
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,070
In the nards, nards.

1088
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:51,526
Go for the nards.

1089
01:03:52,577 --> 01:03:54,100
(grunting)

1090
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,559
- Oh, you suck!

1091
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:56,629
- Point!

1092
01:03:56,629 --> 01:03:57,989
- Go Stan!

1093
01:03:57,989 --> 01:04:00,067
- Point, Slovski.

1094
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:01,378
- Hang on, Soupy!

1095
01:04:01,378 --> 01:04:02,211
Hang on!

1096
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:04,854
- Yeah, all right!

1097
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:08,626
- Beached whale my butt.

1098
01:04:08,626 --> 01:04:11,864
(speaks foreign language)

1099
01:04:11,864 --> 01:04:13,163
- Go get him!
(cackling)

1100
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:15,413
(grunting)

1101
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:25,568
- [Referee] Point!

1102
01:04:25,568 --> 01:04:27,125
(cheering)

1103
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:27,958
- Whoa.

1104
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:37,154
(bell rings)
- Yeah!

1105
01:04:37,154 --> 01:04:38,545
- I didn't know he could do that.

1106
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:42,878
- Point and match, Stan
Slovski, Kickboxing Academy.

1107
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:47,390
- Damn it, Gitler, you suck!

1108
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:50,463
You got beat by a fatty beef burger.

1109
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:52,640
- Shut up.

1110
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,292
- What did you say?

1111
01:04:54,292 --> 01:04:55,125
- Nothing.

1112
01:04:57,543 --> 01:04:59,343
- And now for the cat fight.

1113
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:01,890
Just a little joke.

1114
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,303
The woman's competition.

1115
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:08,450
For the Kickboxing
Academy, Melinda Becker,

1116
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:12,110
and for Fatal Combat, Treck Abbott.

1117
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:18,630
Tarbeck, Treck's a guy.

1118
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,730
- Equal rights, check the rules.

1119
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,063
- It's okay, Melinda, you can take him.

1120
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:27,470
- Go get him, Melinda!

1121
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,143
- If I can do it, you can.

1122
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,813
(speaks foreign language)

1123
01:05:32,813 --> 01:05:35,063
(grunting)

1124
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:41,452
- [Tarbeck] Treck, kick her in the nards!

1125
01:05:41,452 --> 01:05:45,535
(jeering)
- Go, Treck, all right!

1126
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,903
- Get around, take your time.

1127
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:54,249
- Hook kick!
- Sucker punch!

1128
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,008
(applause)

1129
01:06:05,844 --> 01:06:08,511
(ominous music)

1130
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:13,593
- Ow!

1131
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:16,360
Damn chick kicked me in the balls.

1132
01:06:17,698 --> 01:06:19,998
- No point, no point.

1133
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:21,127
(bell rings)

1134
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:25,500
- Point and match, Abbott,
illegal blow below the belt.

1135
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,500
- Excuse me?
(cheering)

1136
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,170
- We still got the black belt competition.

1137
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,440
- I kicked your butt and you know it.

1138
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,810
- Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat,
cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat,

1139
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:38,760
cheat, cheat cheat!

1140
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:42,340
(cheering)

1141
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,883
- I won.
- He did.

1142
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:45,830
- But I cheated.

1143
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,110
- If we lose, we know
it's because they cheated.

1144
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,210
- Losing doesn't save the academy, Pierre.

1145
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:53,060
- Get ready for the
black belt competition.

1146
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,670
Fatal Combat and the Kickboxing Academy

1147
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:58,300
present their finest competitors

1148
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,683
in what could be the deciding match.

1149
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,253
(applauding)

1150
01:07:02,253 --> 01:07:05,971
For the Kickboxing
Academy, Pierre Bersuire.

1151
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,141
(cheering)

1152
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:10,974
Representing Fatal Combat, John Hammer.

1153
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:15,078
(ominous music)

1154
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,030
- Chet was supposed to fight
in the black belt competition.

1155
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:21,983
Who's this clown?

1156
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,340
- [Judge] He's a replacement.

1157
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,343
Says here Chet dislocated his shoulder.

1158
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:33,700
- Yeah, but the replacement
needs to be from Fatal Combat.

1159
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,740
I can only guess where they
found Hulk Hogan over there.

1160
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,297
I know, don't say it,

1161
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:42,297
they have all the appropriate paperwork.

1162
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,166
- What did they say?

1163
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,799
- Pierre, you're next.

1164
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,382
(serene music)

1165
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:52,088
- Look, it's Danny.

1166
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,702
- It's too late, we can't
replace Pierre unless he's--

1167
01:07:57,702 --> 01:07:59,320
(groans)

1168
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,153
Injured.

1169
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:11,580
Pierre Bersuire is injured, we
need to make a substitution.

1170
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,030
Danny Sheridan is the replacement.

1171
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,144
- What the hell is going on here?

1172
01:08:16,144 --> 01:08:18,560
- [Judge] Pierre Bersuire
is being replaced

1173
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,270
by Danny Sheridan.

1174
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,860
- Danny Sher, why he, you can't do that.

1175
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,485
- [Judge] It's done.

1176
01:08:25,485 --> 01:08:28,440
- What's the matter,
afraid of a fair fight?

1177
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,393
- Go ahead, it's his funeral.

1178
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:35,250
(bell rings)

1179
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,433
- There has been a substitution.

1180
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,936
Danny Sheridan will be
fighting for Pierre Bersuire.

1181
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:45,186
(cheering)

1182
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:50,950
- Three point system, one
point deducted for fouls.

1183
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,340
Let's have a clean fight.

1184
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,470
- You're going home in
a stretcher, little man.

1185
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,303
- Let's rumble.

1186
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:59,360
(suspenseful music)

1187
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,610
(grunting)

1188
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:08,112
- Danny!

1189
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:10,362
- Oh, excellent cheap shot.

1190
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,959
- Yeah, I'm gonna get you.

1191
01:09:19,932 --> 01:09:21,140
- Point, Hammer.

1192
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,060
- Why are we always the
ones to get hit first?

1193
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,410
- What do you think, Danny?

1194
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,430
- He's quicker and bigger
and stronger than me.

1195
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,370
Other than that, I think I can take him.

1196
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,943
- Good, go do it.

1197
01:09:38,945 --> 01:09:41,778
(uplifting music)

1198
01:09:45,168 --> 01:09:46,001
(speaks foreign language)

1199
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:49,001
(suspenseful music)

1200
01:09:53,728 --> 01:09:55,517
(grunting)

1201
01:09:55,517 --> 01:09:57,767
(cheering)

1202
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:03,178
- [Announcer] Point, Sheridan.

1203
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:14,419
(jeering)

1204
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,398
- I'm number one.

1205
01:10:16,398 --> 01:10:18,731
- [Announcer] Point, Hammer.

1206
01:10:27,044 --> 01:10:29,377
(clamoring)

1207
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:33,085
(cheering)

1208
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,168
(growls)

1209
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:37,558
- Point!

1210
01:10:37,558 --> 01:10:39,068
- [Announcer] Point, Sheridan.

1211
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:39,901
- Yes, good kick.

1212
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:41,650
- Aw, that's not a good cheap shot.

1213
01:10:42,549 --> 01:10:44,421
(speaks foreign language)

1214
01:10:44,421 --> 01:10:46,671
(grunting)

1215
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,182
(triumphant music)

1216
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:10,432
(cheering)

1217
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,370
(bell rings)

1218
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:20,370
- Point and match, Danny
Sheridan, the Kickboxing Academy.

1219
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:25,872
- That sucks.

1220
01:11:28,505 --> 01:11:30,700
- The tournament now stands at a tie.

1221
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:34,596
The judges have informed me
that in a contest of this sort,

1222
01:11:34,596 --> 01:11:38,580
a tie is broken through
competition by the instructors.

1223
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,580
Will Masters Hung and Tarbeck
please approach the mat?

1224
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:46,270
- Just what the hell
are you trying to pull?

1225
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:48,723
- [Judge] It's in the
rules, check the rules.

1226
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,233
- I'm sorry, but I can't fight.

1227
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,530
Reasons I can't discuss,
I just can't fight.

1228
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,530
- You have to put the past
behind you or it blocks your way.

1229
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:03,730
You can't deny who you
are, you're a kickboxer.

1230
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:06,360
- Yeah, so get out there
and kick some butt.

1231
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,130
- Yeah, go kick his butt.

1232
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,090
- Absolutely, make him
wish I was never born.

1233
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:13,073
- If you don't fight, we can't win.

1234
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,070
- Excellent, Captain, I've always wanted

1235
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,330
to see you sucker punch a chick.

1236
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,163
- Heck yeah!

1237
01:12:18,163 --> 01:12:19,400
- Yeah, show us how it's done!

1238
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,323
- Take her down.
- Yeah, cheat and stuff.

1239
01:12:22,323 --> 01:12:24,463
(chuckles)

1240
01:12:24,463 --> 01:12:26,500
(foreboding music)

1241
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,070
- Say June, maybe we can
work something out here.

1242
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,413
- Not likely, Tarbeck.

1243
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,691
- Come on, sucker punch her.

1244
01:12:34,691 --> 01:12:36,839
(clamoring)

1245
01:12:36,839 --> 01:12:37,672
- Yeah!

1246
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:41,361
(grunts)

1247
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:43,919
Go bad boy!

1248
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:47,447
(speaks foreign language)

1249
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:48,879
(grunts)

1250
01:12:48,879 --> 01:12:51,678
(cheering)

1251
01:12:51,678 --> 01:12:52,659
- Come on, Captain!

1252
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,318
- Point, Kickboxing Academy.
- Point!

1253
01:12:55,318 --> 01:12:57,401
(coughs)

1254
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,001
- Come on, come on!

1255
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:03,982
Captain, come on!

1256
01:13:03,982 --> 01:13:05,990
(clamoring)

1257
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:07,020
- Sucker punch!

1258
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,439
- Kick her again.
- Come on!

1259
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:12,170
- Yeah!
- Come on, yeah!

1260
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:14,420
(cheering)

1261
01:13:16,019 --> 01:13:18,307
- [Announcer] Point, Kickboxing Academy.

1262
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:21,747
Remember, first three
points takes the tournament.

1263
01:13:21,747 --> 01:13:23,650
(suspenseful music)

1264
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:27,253
- It kinda looks like she's
kicking your butt, sir!

1265
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,517
- I'm just baiting her.

1266
01:13:35,347 --> 01:13:37,776
- Hey Tarbeck, your fly's open!

1267
01:13:37,776 --> 01:13:40,110
- Don't even think about
it, kid, I wrote that gag.

1268
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:43,880
- Well if your fly isn't open,
what the heck is that thing?

1269
01:13:47,414 --> 01:13:48,414
- Eating it.

1270
01:13:53,369 --> 01:13:54,569
(grunting)

1271
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:55,473
(bell rings)

1272
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:58,851
- Point and match, Kickboxing Academy!

1273
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,101
(cheering)

1274
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:20,010
- Come on, Captain!
- Captain!

1275
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,900
- Well June, you won fair and square.

1276
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,100
I'm not going to be a sore loser,

1277
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,823
so I offer my congratulations.

1278
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,850
- Does this mean I'm keeping my academy?

1279
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,190
- And that I'll be lining up
some corporate sponsorships

1280
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:40,060
for you.

1281
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,500
It's time for all of us
to put the past behind us.

1282
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,140
- Thank you, sir, and I
am sorry about your son.

1283
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,320
- I know.

1284
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,550
Well, a new beginning.

1285
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,450
- A new beginning.

1286
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:54,500
- Sir, I wouldn't be so quick
jumping into verbal contracts

1287
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,150
with someone who, up
until five minutes ago,

1288
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,570
we were strategizing against.

1289
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:02,490
- Master June, I got
something you gotta see.

1290
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,323
- Beat it.

1291
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:04,720
- Please, Max, I'm busy.

1292
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,680
- Now Carl, have you
got the paperwork ready?

1293
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,360
June is retaining full ownership
of the Kickboxing Academy,

1294
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,090
all debts paid.

1295
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,280
- I don't think so, sir,
it's no longer yours to give.

1296
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,550
- What are you talking about?

1297
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,980
- The Kickboxing Academy is in my name.

1298
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,940
I plan on razing the entire block

1299
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,160
and putting up an office building.

1300
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,430
- How can you do that?

1301
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:27,990
- Simple, I have his power
of attorney, love cheeks.

1302
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,630
I can sign his name to
just about anything.

1303
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:32,720
- And he's giving Fatal Combat,

1304
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,130
soon to be Tarbeck's Army
Surplus Emporium, to me.

1305
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,450
- I'll take you to court.

1306
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,960
I'll get you disbarred.

1307
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,030
- Okay, expect a decision
by the 22nd century, maybe.

1308
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,510
- Not quite, dude.

1309
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,173
Master June, check it out.

1310
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:50,880
- [June] Wait a second.

1311
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,963
- I'm surprised at myself.

1312
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,280
- It's okay, sir, we all
have to lose sometimes.

1313
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,780
- I'm a little surprised I had someone

1314
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,000
as stupid as you in my employ.

1315
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,620
This young man has just handed
me the original documents

1316
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,350
in which you gave yourself
ownership of the academy.

1317
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:07,183
- What?

1318
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,330
You idiot, what did you do?

1319
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:13,313
You were supposed to file the
originals and make copies.

1320
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,593
- Whoops, I guess I messed
up accidentally on purpose.

1321
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:21,720
- Hey, what's this?

1322
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,423
- Oh, that's a xerox of my butt.

1323
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:27,430
- Great, I'm ruined.

1324
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:29,380
- More than that, you're going to jail.

1325
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:32,010
- AKA the slammer, if
you know what I mean,

1326
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,819
and I think you do.

1327
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:36,486
(ominous music)

1328
01:16:41,578 --> 01:16:44,578
(suspenseful music)

1329
01:16:46,098 --> 01:16:48,431
(screaming)

1330
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:59,967
- Everybody freeze!

1331
01:17:07,487 --> 01:17:09,500
- But you said freeze, sir.

1332
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,470
- Not you nimrods, you're my troops,

1333
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,673
my backup, my battalion.

1334
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:16,730
- Sir, we lost a kickboxing match.

1335
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:18,880
Don't you think creating
a hostage situation

1336
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,500
is a bit severe?

1337
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,790
- Yeah, sir, my mom's supposed
to pick me up out front

1338
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:26,000
in like 15 minutes.

1339
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,860
- Nevermind that!

1340
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:29,362
Treck, check the exits.

1341
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:31,590
- Maybe we should think about this, sir.

1342
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:34,540
- Sir, we won't tell anybody
that a chick kicked your butt.

1343
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,620
- It's over, Reeve,
don't make matters worse.

1344
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,457
- No, no!

1345
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,563
It's not over!

1346
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,720
Carl promised me!

1347
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,840
He promised I'd get to
open up my Army Navy store

1348
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,673
if I helped him!

1349
01:17:48,673 --> 01:17:50,980
I can't spend the rest the rest of my life

1350
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:53,740
teaching worthless teenagers anymore!

1351
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:54,873
- Captain Tarbeck!

1352
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:57,303
- Shut up.

1353
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,503
I know you all laughed at me.

1354
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,933
You always laughed at me.

1355
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,323
You all have.

1356
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,953
Who's laughing now?

1357
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:15,850
(laughs)

1358
01:18:24,156 --> 01:18:26,323
It's my turn to shine now.

1359
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:34,110
You all had everything, but not anymore.

1360
01:18:36,324 --> 01:18:37,324
Not anymore.

1361
01:18:46,673 --> 01:18:48,013
(cheering)
- Yes!

1362
01:18:48,013 --> 01:18:50,930
(triumphant music)

1363
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:57,570
- Well, we did it, gang.

1364
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,790
I think this one's for the record books.

1365
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:02,120
- McMahon, I wanna thank
you for what you did today.

1366
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,590
I feel I owe you a debt of gratitude.

1367
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:06,040
- No problem, MC numero uno.

1368
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,840
Hey, Tarbeck!

1369
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,320
Let me know what you're
phone number's gonna be

1370
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,240
in jail, all right?

1371
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,170
- What for?

1372
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:13,788
- Gotta stay on top of my
prank phone call skills.

1373
01:19:13,788 --> 01:19:14,795
- What?
(laughing)

1374
01:19:14,795 --> 01:19:15,986
Why I oughta!

1375
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:17,553
Let me at him!

1376
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:19,777
- See you later, all
right, all right, yeah.

1377
01:19:19,777 --> 01:19:21,290
(upbeat music)

1378
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,320
- Tell her, Barry.

1379
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,950
- It was kind of an ancient
mushu gaipan secret.

1380
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:26,920
- Ooh, did you get hurt?

1381
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,283
- Nope, but they sure did.

1382
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,230
- You used my secret moves.

1383
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,270
- Thanks for the pointers, Jason.

1384
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,760
- So no more trouble with Fatal Combat.

1385
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,833
- And no more lawyer boyfriends.

1386
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:44,170
- You can keep the academy
as long as you like.

1387
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,080
The appropriate papers are being delivered

1388
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,283
to you tomorrow morning by me.

1389
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:50,530
- Really?

1390
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:51,980
- The inevitable comes to pass.

1391
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:56,980
I am now working for the el
jefe grande, Councilman Maddox.

1392
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:00,700
And with my raise came
the prompt acquisition

1393
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,683
of the skateboard of my
dreams, the king daddy thrash.

1394
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,753
- Yeah, so let's party.

1395
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,760
- Listen, rugrat, you gotta be home by 10,

1396
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,863
so we're out of here.

1397
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:18,560
- Brian, I'll keep you
company on the ride.

1398
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,393
- [Brian] Sure.

1399
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:25,193
- So Cindy, where's Danny?

1400
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:29,213
- I'm not positive, but I do have an idea.

1401
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:33,143
(uplifting music)

1402
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:41,470
- What took you so long?

1403
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,163
- I thought you'd come by the party.

1404
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:45,843
- No you didn't.

1405
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:08,330
