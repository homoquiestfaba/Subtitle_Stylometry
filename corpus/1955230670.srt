1
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,789
So what happened after that?

2
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,757
I was attacked.

3
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,193
I am so sorry.

4
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,927
By a mountain lion.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,562
Oh my God.

6
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,164
Big, muscular guy.

7
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:34,268
The park ranger said he was
attracted to my perfume.

8
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,270
You know, I smelled that
when you came in.

9
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:38,539
It was very unusual.
What is it?

10
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,341
Mountain lion urine.

11
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,542
Oh.

12
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,312
Have you ever been taken from
behind by a mountain lion?

13
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,815
I cannot say that I have.

14
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,250
It wasn't half bad.

15
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,988
We're going to need a lot
more sessions.

16
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,091
This changed me, Corey!

17
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,561
He dragged me to his cave!

18
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,831
I've had worse dates.

19
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,833
So, two times a week?

20
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,236
I never knew it could
be like that.

21
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,704
His tongue was like sandpaper.

22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,841
He polished me down there.

23
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,677
Like a bowling ball.

24
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,647
Let's make it three.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,188

27
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,088
Oh yes, yes!

[Moaning]

29
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:46,634
Almost, almost... yes! Yes!

30
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,637
Was it worth the wait?

31
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:58,379
Here - buy yourself
something pretty.

32
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,050
Oh - but hurry home, sweetie.

33
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,918
I don't want to miss
"Housewives."

34
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,389
Yes, dear.

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,903
Excuse me - may I help you?

36
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,409
I'd like to make an
appointment.

37
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,646
* * *

38
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,215
Change!

39
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,619
Hey, buddy, you got a
little change?

40
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,621
Actually, I gave at
the office.

41
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,823
Really, coffee
business is that bad?

42
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,191
Are you finally gonna do it?

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,394
I have the rings right here.

44
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,729
You've been carrying them
around for three months!

45
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,632
What are you waiting for,
man-opause?

46
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,135
I'll do it before I'm 30!

47
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,137
Three more months? Whatever!

48
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,139
It's got to be perfect!

49
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,074
I actually have it
all mapped out.

50
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,175
As usual!

51
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,244
Kelse, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

52
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,113
Not for our parents.

53
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,581
Well, thank God I'm
not our parents!

54
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,417
You're right, our parents
would never wear...

55
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,619
ZEBRA-STRIPED THONGS!

56
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,886
Shut up!

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,355
Poor little baby zebra,

58
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,724
Oh, I bet his mommy misses it!

59
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,394
I actually freed the zebra,
about an hour ago.

60
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,831
At the office?
Dirty little whore!

61
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,633
I know, it's unprofessional,

62
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,468
But my heart was in
the right place.

63
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,470
Yeah, that's not your heart.

64
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,472
I believe it's
connected to my heart.

65
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,007
This "perfect moment" thing
has gone on long enough!

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,710
If you don't ask him tonight,
I'm going to ask him for you.

67
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,212
Don't, please, you're
going to mess it up.

68
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,714
I will if you make me!

69
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:41,549
Ow, seriously?

70
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,551
I'm going to call
him at 6:00 AM.

71
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,319
Either I'll say
congratulations,

72
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,120
Or I'm popping the question.

73
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,057
Okay! I'll ask... him.

74
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,060
I'll ask him!

Tonight? Pinky swear!

Don't wait for the
perfect moment.

77
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,300
Sometimes love happens when
you're making other plans.

78
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:07,475
I don't, uh...
believe in zebras.

79
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,577
Thongs, I don't wear...

80
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,682
I hooked dad up with some
stuff to take care of it...

81
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,817
Babe, I'm home!

82
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:26,159
Yeah mom, I'll tell him...
Yeah, I'll tell him.

83
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,397
Mom says to tell you that
she loves you.

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,332
And that the housewives are
shameless hussies.

85
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,302
Well, you tell that hussy
I love her too.

86
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,404
And dad!

87
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,472
He loves you, too. And dad.

00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,175

Pigeon... foie gras!

00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,522
The market was fresh out of
pigeon.

00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,456
And I made brownies.

00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,362
From scratch, I'm
not a savage!

There's an order to the
food universe.

00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,366
Brownies are reserved for
special occasions.

99

Parties, birthdays...

100
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,038
Well, we'll party on your
birthday, then.

ordered us a pizza.

It better get here soon.

can snack on.

have to take...

is a client!

gonna cost me?

I'm more worried about who's
getting into you.

Why are you always flirting
with these straight guys?

I wasn't flirting, he just
wasn't what I expected.

want to get an early start.

There's some new plays I
need to learn, and...

But we had plans - it
was date night.

I hate these places.

A friend told me I should
get out more often.

160
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,110
You know, be more social.

don't exactly look

making friends.

00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:13,212
He's an athlete.
An amazing cook!

357
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:22,154
God, he makes the most
unbelievable brownies!

358
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,557
Corey?

359
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,059
Corey?

360
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,061
- Corey!
- Hi. Corey.

361
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,331
- Yes!
- Melissa. Hi.

362
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:36,669
I was, I was... just lost in a
thought, for a moment.

363
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,671
Boy, this guy sounds like
quite a catch!

364
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:43,343
You sure there's not someone
else in his life?

365
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,313
Oh, no - God, believe me!

366
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,716
We talked, about everything.

367
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,250
He's very open.

368
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,553
Actually, the other night
he told me he'd

369
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,222
Been with both boys and girls.

370
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,224
So he's bisexual?

371
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,427
Um, he didn't want to
call it that, no.

372
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,296
He said something like...
"sexy flexible?"

373
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,764
"Flexi-sexual?"

374
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,034
- Yeah!
- Oh! That didn't bother you?

375
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,369
- No!
- Just a little?

376
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,770
- No!
- Just a little bit annoying?

377
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,773
Why would it bother me?
I mean, we all have a history.

378
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,142
I experimented with
girls in college.

379
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,378
Now you're not - we'll
get back to that.

380
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,314
Now, you're not worried
that he's, in the future,

381
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,351
Just going to up and leave
you for another guy?

382
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,886
I'm not worried
about anything.

383
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,922
For the first time in my life.

384
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,193
He's really into me.
And I'm really into him.

385
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,497
That's all I need for now.

386
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:43,235
You even said: stop obsessing!
And live in the moment!

387
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,237
That's really good advice.

388
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,907
- I like my boobs now!
- That's great.

389
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,276
Yeah, because, um, well...

390
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,713
- He's a boob man!
- No he's not... is he?

391
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,147
He loves boobs!

392
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,884
He's probably an ass man, too.

393
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,387
I told her I was glad
I could help.

394
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,389
She needs me, she's
so vulnerable.

395
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,391
She needs me for support.

396
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,693
You just want to pump her
for information.

397
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,430
Okay, okay, I'll refer her to
another therapist.

398
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,432
I'll be out of town until
they break up.

399
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,868
What if they don't?

400
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,670
So, who is this guy?

401
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,907
Online Love Match.
I have three matches!

402
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,709
Three? I'm surprised!

403
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,011
You're surprised I could
get three matches?

404
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:28,114
I'm surprised there are three
guys using onine dating.

405
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,183
The guys at the cafe all use
that smartphone gaydar.

406
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:34,854
Oh, Grindr?
I don't need Grindr.

407
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:38,491
I have three smokin'-hot guys
on the hook already.

408
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,093
When are you seeing all these
smokin'-hot guys?

409
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,361
Today.

410
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,765
What, all at once?
You're not that limber!

411
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,799
Not all at once.

412
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,801
I've scheduled them in 30
minute increments,

413
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,236
10 minutes apart.
The site recommended it,

414
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,404
They said it's very...

415
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,406
- Crazy!
- Efficient.

416
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,476
I just want to kiss someone
on my birthday!

417
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,478
One of these guys has
to work out.

418
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,913
Which reminds me - what do you
want for your birthday?

419
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,949
I mean, besides cock.

420
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:03,916
What?

421
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,453
It sounds so wrong coming
out of your mouth.

422
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,621
So, who's the first guy?

423
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:12,191
25. Gorgeous. Male model.

424
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,392
Oh, you should see his
picture.

425
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,661
Very glamorous.

426
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,129
Liberace took that photo
of me by his pool

427
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:19,599
At his villa in Palm Springs.

428
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,435
Your profile said you were 25?

429
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:26,606
Yes, I was 25! When Liberace
took that photo.

430
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,442
Of course, now I deal
in antiques.

431
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,944
You do like antiques,
don't you, Corey?

432
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,546
I... am not sure.

433
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,548
Oh, well you should, dear boy!

434
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,984
I mean, just today, I took in
a fine Chippendale

435
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,418
That's centuries old!

436
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,088
Of course, the drawers
are sagging a bit,

437
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,090
And the poor, dried-out knobs!

438
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,892
Practically falling off.

439
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,194
But there's nothing
quite as satisfying

440
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,763
As spending hour after hour

441
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:54,567
Lovingly polishing old wood.

442
00:23:54,601 --> 00:24:00,039
Working the moisture into
those musty cracks.

443
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:04,644
So, when your profile said
"twice the man..."

444
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,179
Identical twins. Yeah.

445
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,948
We'll have you
coming and going.

446
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,950
Well, fellas...

447
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,986
Plural.

448
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,822
This is a lot to take in.

449
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:21,360
Oh, don't worry.
We'll make it fit.

450
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,330
Ouch.

451
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,132
Wow, you're really great.

452
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,801
This is a relief - to go out
with a normal guy

453
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,170
Who actually looks like his
profile picture.

454
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,373
Oh my God! Tell me about it.

455
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:39,579
So, Kyle - tell me
about yourself.

456
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:43,616
I saw on your profile
you have a son?

457
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,788
I do.
Would you like to meet him?

458
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,024
Sure - I mean, definitely,
yeah, at some point.

459
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:55,327
Well, I mean I ordinarily like
to take it slow,

460
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:58,230
But I don't know, this
just feels...

461
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,232
Right.

462
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:03,235
Why wait?

463
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:08,875
Corey, meet Gary.

464
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,142
Gary?

465
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,913
Are you gonna be my new daddy?

466
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:20,386
I'm a growing boy, and I need
a strong male role model.

467
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,589
Wow, okay, so you're
a puppeteer!

468
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,391
That is so great.

469
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,895
Puppeteer?

470
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:33,065
It's happening again.
He's just like all the others.

471
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,234
He doesn't think I'm real.

472
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:40,306
You know how ANGRY I get when
people don't think I'm real...

473
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,308
I get all STABBY!

474
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,643
[Gary screaming]

475
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,077
No, Corey's not like
all the others!

476
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:45,945
Are you, Corey?

477
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,147
No no, I'm not like
all the others!

478
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:57,690
[Screaming]

479
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:01,393
This has been really nice -
you're so good with Gary.

480
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,196
I'll call you!

481
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,998
Dammit.

482
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,600
He was so cute.

483
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,169
Do you suppose I could get
conjugal visits?

484
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,773
With him, or the puppet?

485
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,543
I am officially destined to
be alone forever.

486
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:22,414
For the love of - would you
give me your phone?

487
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:26,719
Gimme!

488
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,588
Is your password still
"Dongmaster82?"

489
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,659
Wow, just tell the whole
world, why don't you?

490
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:36,562
Here you go.
Welcome to the 21st Century.

491
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,564
Have fun!

492
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,167
Have fun with what?

493
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:58,117
Oh! Oh...

494
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,320
Maybe... yes!

495
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,723
Ooh, a fireman!

496
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:06,625
I'm 200 feet away
from a fireman!

497
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,228
I bet I got some matches
around here somewhere.

498
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,563
Do not set fire to my cafe!

499
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,565
Okay, buzzkill.

500
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,472
No, no... ooh, maybe.

501
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,476
No, no!

502
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,079
Oh, yeah... oh my God, yes!

503
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:27,814
What?

504
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,816
It's him, it's him! He's gay!

505
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,217
- And single.
- Who?

506
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,253
I have to go, he's 100 feet
away, on the move!

507
00:27:34,286 --> 00:28:00,179
* * *

508
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,381
I zigged, when I
should've zagged.

509
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,383
Did you catch the fireman?

510
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,517
Better!

511
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,686
What's better than a fireman?

512
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,521
A pizza guy.

513
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,359
Did you hit your head
or something?

514
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,660
It says he's looking for

515
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,662
"Friendship, love,
or whatever."

516
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,664
That's very specific.

517
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,666
Hey - I know this guy! Pete!

518
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,668
Triple Venti soy
caramel macchiato!

519
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,337
He comes to Thursday
night Poetry Night.

520
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,873
He's a great read.

521
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,541
- Well I love poetry!
- You? Since when?

522
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,610
Since... what time is it now?

523
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:38,717
People look at me like being a
lesbian is a fashion craze,

524
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:43,022
When being a lesbian
is my TRUTH!

525
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,059
I lick vagina, and I LOVE IT!

526
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,861
[Bongos]

527
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:52,464
My aching sadness
echoes endlessly,

528
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:57,236
Like the DRIP, DRIP, DRIP of
the raindrops flow.

529
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:01,340
My bitter tears bleed, down in
the puddles

530

00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:59,104
"Well yes, I would like a
little Captain in me."

708
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:03,274
So he rolled me over, bent me
over that big space chair,

709
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,344
And we went at it -
warp speed ahead!

710
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:07,979
Completely out of the blue?

711
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,481
Completely out of the blue.

712
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:12,250
Some of the best times
I've ever had

713
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,420
Are completely out
of the blue.

714
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:18,189
You've got to roll
with the changes.

715
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,026
Leap before you
look sometimes!

716
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:26,364
Bone a spaceman or two!

717
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,900
So, what's my penance?

718
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:33,371
Millie, we've been over this.
You know I'm not a priest.

719
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,907
Besides, there's no crime in
giving yourself over

720
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:41,680
To the love of... a starship
captain... commander.

721
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,014
All of them!

722
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,516
That's a relief.

723
00:39:44,550 --> 00:40:01,132
You should hear what I did to
Dr. Spork!

724
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,902
Wow!

725
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,704
All this for lunch?

726
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,640
My cleaning lady's a klepto.

727
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:10,642
Sure you're not just
addicted to work?

728
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:13,344
Hey, I'll do the analyzing
around here, mister!

729
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:16,414
- Where are we going?
- That's a surprise.

730
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:19,685
I'm not super-big on surpises.

731
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:31,262
You're going to like this one.

732
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:34,500
Wow... so this is lunch?

733
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,703
It's no fancy restaurant,
I know.

734
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,271
But I wanted to share
this with you.

735
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,241
Oh God, It's beautiful!

736
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,543
Epic!

737
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:50,649
And I cannot stand that word,
but this is truly...

738
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,118
Epic.

739
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:54,553
It's my refuge.

740
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:58,056
It makes me feel centered.

741
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,758
No matter what's going on,

742
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:06,164
Everything's going
to be alright.

743
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:11,169
I need to feel that.

744
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,139
Look, I know you've been hurt,
and I don't want to...

745
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:21,613
That was all in the past.

746
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:26,284
I was with my ex for
a long time.

747
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,589
I knew it was over
before he did.

748
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:34,359
When a man loves you, it's
right there in his eyes.

749
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,361
When he looks at you,

750
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:44,335
You can tell you're like
breathing to him.

751
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,337
Hey, let's chow down!

752
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,339
I've got some great
food for us.

753
00:41:48,373 --> 00:43:01,446
* * *

754
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:04,315
So...

755
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,486
Yeah.
I should probably get going.

756
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,589
Yeah.

757
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:47,558
I might want to be too...

758
00:43:47,592 --> 00:45:44,709
* * *

759
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,845
A three-layer birthday
ice cream cake

760
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,347
That says, "Happy
Birthday Corey."

761
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,116
Big old letters!

762
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:54,019
No, no, that's "Corey,"
with an E-Y.

763
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:56,321
Okay, Friday? That's perfect,

764
00:45:56,354 --> 00:46:06,697
Yes, I'm sure Corey's going to
be very surprised.

765
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:10,235
Look at you, the hot
mess express!

766
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,503
Yep!

767
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,039
I'm so proud of you!

768
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,740
You've come so far from the
tight-ass lunatic

769
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,774
I grew up with.

770
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:18,776
I'm pretty much
Mr. Adventure now.

771
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,778
Don't get hung up on labels.

772
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,780
Friendship, love, or...
whatever.

773
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:24,649
Excellent!

774
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:25,951
Which reminds me...

775
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:28,719
I want to talk to you about
the birthday schedule.

776
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,721
I need you to be out of the
house midnight

777
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:31,923
The night before,

778
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:33,925
So I can get my birthday
kiss from Pete.

779
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,493
The following day...

780
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,761
Yeah, I'll read it over.

781
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,496
Please initial
where the Xs are.

782
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,498
- Freak!
- I was kidding!

783
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,802
I doubt it.

784
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:51,809
I emailed you a copy.

785
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,811
See you next week!

786
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:57,148
Corey!
Hi, do you have a minute?

787
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,750
Hi Melissa - no, I'm
on my way out.

788
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,052
It'll just take five minutes.

789
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:03,054
I didn't have anyone
else to turn to,

790
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:05,790
And you're the only one that
would understand.

791
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,792
Come on in.

792
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,361
I'm sorry to corner you
like this, it's just

793
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:12,563
I called that
referral you gave me!

794
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,565
And she wouldn't understand!

795
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,134
It's my boyfriend.

796
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,504
I think...

797
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,306
He's cheating.

798
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:25,810
This is the, uh...
bisexual guy?

799
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,812
- "Flexi."
- Really? Still?

800
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,881
That's okay.

801
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:33,318
Why do you think he's
being unfaithful?

802
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:37,022
Um, I don't know if
unfaithful is the word.

803
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:41,526
Um, I don't know exactly
HOW TO PUT IT INTO WORDS!

804
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,328
- I just...
- Okay, slow down.

805
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,330
Take it easy.
Tell me what he did.

806
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:50,301
We've been arguing, and he
keeps making these excuses

807
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,103
To not be with me.

808
00:47:52,137 --> 00:48:01,446
He just looks at me
differently.

809
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,280
Jon!

810
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:06,117
What?
How did you know I was here?

811
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:09,687
I... I saw your minivan.

812
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,656
I'm sorry about earlier.
Can we talk?

813
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:21,899
Well... yeah!

814
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:24,369
Corey, thank you, so much.

815
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,073
I didn't mean to take
advantage of you,

816
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,807
I appreciate you listening.

817
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:59,304
I really appreciate
our friendship.

818
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:02,773
- Who died?
- I'll take a shot of whiskey.

819
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,010
Why will no one just
order coffee?

820
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:08,513
I've tried your coffee.

821
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:11,316
Speaking of which, I need
to talk to you.

822
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:14,285
I'm like, having some
cash flow issues.

823
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,087
Hey! You ready?

824
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,089
It's really important!

825
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,625
Kelse, whatever it is, it can
wait til tonight.

826
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,194
We don't need to rush off.
We can hang loose.

827
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:25,430
No, we can't, we're
on a schedule.

828
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,432
The movie starts in
a half hour.

829
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,601
So we get there a little late.
What's the big deal?

830
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,403
The tickets are
non-refundable.

831
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:40,911
You know what?
Fine. Enjoy your movie.

832
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:42,180
You didn't need to leave
her like that.

833
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:45,216
She sounds like she
needs to talk to you.

834
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,252
Honeslty, I don't want
to hear about

835
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,654
Anyone else's feelings today.

836
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,656
Isn't that kind of your job?

837
00:49:51,689 --> 00:50:02,367
Yeah, well - I'm
off the clock.

838
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,035
It was nothing like
the preview.

839
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:05,836
I thought it was pretty good.

840
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,039
You like that highbrow stuff,
I just wanted a chick flick.

841
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:10,041
Something simple.
No more surprises.

842
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:11,709
What are you so wound
up today for?

843
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:12,843
I don't know, okay?

844
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,079
What can I do to
make it better?

845
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,081
Just quit being so
fucking perfect!

846
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,083
I'm not perfect.
I'm far from it.

847
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:20,085
Oh my God, seriously,
what's wrong with you?

848
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:21,752
Why do you even like me?

849
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,088
What kind of question is that?

850
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,189
A fair one!

851
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,191
You're a great guy,
with a good heart.

852
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:27,825
Yeah and I'm really sweet,
and nice,

853
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,027
But you know what, I'm not
some Pepperoni Adonis who...

854
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,429
Wait, is that how you see me?

855
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:32,697
Trust me, that's how everyone
sees you!

856
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,664
Guys like you...

857
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:37,702
There's not "guys like me."
There's just me.

858
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,438
I'm real. What am I to you?

859
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,440
Just some empty-headed
underwear model

860
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,909
Who coasts through life on
his pecs and glutes?

861
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:50,148
I didn't say you coast.

862
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,883
Come on, you're like the
hottest guy I've ever met!

863
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,885
What could even see in me?!

864
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,687
Don't box me into that.
That's not me.

865
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,789
My entire life I've had to
deal with people treating me

866
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,125
Like a piece of meat.

867
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,692
I didn't expect you to do it,
too.

868
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:05,263
Wow, that sounds really hard.

869
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:06,631
I'm just going to
call it a night.

870
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:07,598
Good.

871
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,800
Call me whenever you get
your head together.

872
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:23,481
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

873
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:27,252
Lately I find myself walking
through the woods

874
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:31,622
With a bunch of raw steaks.

875
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:32,590
Uh-huh.

876
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,394
The mountain lion at the
zoo got a new mate.

877
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,063
I don't know what he
sees in her.

878
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,000
She's just some plain
Jane cougar.

879
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,636
That fleabag doesn't know
what he needs.

880
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,704
Uh-huh.

881
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:50,408
Once you go lion, you
never stop tryin'.

882
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,210
Sounds good.

883
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:55,813
Hell yeah it does.

884
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,815
Wait, what?

885
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:02,520
Huh?

886
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:03,921
On the house.

887
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,923
Thanks.

888
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,158
So I guess you heard?/

889
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:09,160
He called to cry about it.
I hung up on him.

890
00:52:09,194 --> 00:52:11,162
I haven't heard him cry that
much since

891
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:13,998
They stopped making Zima.

892
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,333
You and I still cool?

893
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:18,369
Slam poet code, dude.

894
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,371
That's what I'm talking about.

895
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:22,573
How long have you
had this place?

896
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,375
Three years.

897
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:27,278
I always wanted a place
where freaks, weirdos,

898
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:31,249
Artists, and queers could come
get amped up on caffeine

899
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:35,986
And inspiration, and go
take on the world.

900
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,723
There's a lot of you in here.

901
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,124
It's home!

902
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,527
Hell, I slept in the
kitchen the first year.

903
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,396
Health Department finally
kicked me out.

904
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,331
Why?

905
00:52:46,364 --> 00:52:48,466
I did this one babe
on the counter.

906
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,900
Health inspector walked in

907
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:53,471
Right before I
ground her mocha.

908
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,773
I just hope I can hold on
to this place.

909
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:59,109
I'm a people person - but
spreadsheets, ugh!

910
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:02,947
Me too.
Money just gives me headaches!

911
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,783
I like my dollars
like my women:

912
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:10,255
Too many to count!

913
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:15,326
So, are you gonna go over to
our place later?

914
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,994
You think he'd want me to?

915
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,229
God yes!

916
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:20,431
I'm sure he's hanging
by the phone,

917
00:53:20,465 --> 00:53:22,833
Counting the minutes
and the pretzels.

918
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,269
204.

919
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:26,271
God, he's got you
doing it now, too?

920
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:28,273
Unfortunately.

921
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:31,542
He's been planning his
midnight kiss since 1985.

922
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:32,710
You're right.

923
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,779
I have to get the
birthday kiss right.

924
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:35,980
Yeah!
No pressure, dude.

925
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,749
Game face!

926
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,918
I gotta get out of here,
gotta get to the pizzeria.

927
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,255
Here - take our house key.

928
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:47,091
He loves surprises!

929
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:53,097
Thanks, Kelsey.

930
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:58,269
I said to Bobby, "Let's try it
missionary style this time."

931
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,505
You know... "heart to heart."

932
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:04,342
Millie, have you ever heard of
Münchausen Syndrome?

933
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:08,579
Heard of it?
Hell, I invented it.

934
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:14,852
I just wish I had someone
to share it with.

935
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:18,022
I mean, I wish I had someone
special to share it with,

936
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:20,024
For free.

937
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:24,929
You're kind of like a
talk gigolo.

938
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:31,268
Listen - I've got to go,
it's my big 3-0 tomorrow.

939
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:35,540
Woo-hoo, the big 3-0!

940
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,542
What is that in gay years, 85?

941
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:38,743
Hey!

942
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:44,281
Hey, yeah - those old hard
candies, mentholated ointment,

943
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:48,118
Adult diapers!
They're all ahead of you!

944
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:52,657
You know, I remember
when I was 30.

945
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:57,495
I was so set in my ways, so
sure of everything.

946
00:54:57,528 --> 00:55:03,701
I didn't know about change.

947
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:06,904
I didn't know how much
fun I could have.

948
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,874
It's about the journey.

949
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:14,211
The big adventure is
just ahead of you!

950
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:22,520
Just find someone to share it
with, and you've got it made.

951
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:25,155
Yeah.

952
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:31,128
Of course... I do
make things up.

953
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:55,953
[Doorbell]

954
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,755
Kelsey: I don't need much!

955
00:55:57,788 --> 00:56:00,625
Just a couple thousand to
get me through.

956
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,961
[Knocking]

957
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,195
Kelse, I gotta go.

958
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:23,448
Kelsey: Call me back!

959
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,149
What are you doing?

960
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:30,555
I came home.

961
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:35,059
This place is not your home.

962
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:38,028
We had plans, remember?

963
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,430
The kiss.

964
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:41,499
I remember a lot of things.
Like, your girlfriend.

965
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:42,800
Where is she?

966
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,769
It's - it's not like that.
We have an understanding.

967
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,771
Really?
That's not what she says.

968
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,473
Wait - you're not still
talking to her?

969
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:50,475
I have to, Jon! You won't.

970
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:52,009
Jesus, Corey, that's
really unethical.

971
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:52,910
Yeah?

972
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,813
Tell me a little
something about ethics.

973
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,248
Don't!

974
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:00,618
I can't help it.

975
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:03,353
I feel like I can't
breathe without you.

976
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:06,056
Use your inhaler.
You always forget.

977
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,826
Sometimes you don't
appreciate what you have

978
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,328
Until you lose it.

979
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,231
You! I didn't appreciate
what I had with you!

980
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:20,471
I didn't realize.

981
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:24,408
- You do now?
- Yeah.

982
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,477
No matter how scared I was,

983
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:30,014
No matter how much I
wanted or needed,

984
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:36,386
I should've never done
anything to hurt you.

985
00:57:36,420 --> 00:58:10,788
I told you not to come back,
unless...

986
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:16,360
[Moaning]

987
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:19,229
I have missed this!

988
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,865
That was a mistake.

989
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:23,601
A mistake?
Are you kidding me?!

990
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,603
This was fucking perfect!

991
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,605
You felt it too, I
know you did.

992
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:30,908
It wasn't you.
I just need time.

993
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,176
[Car horn]

994
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:35,045
You should probably get
your clothes and go.

995
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,847
Hey!

996
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:40,017
I had Jimbo watch the shop, I
didn't want you to miss out

997
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,885
On your birthday...

998
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:42,887
What the fuck, we didn't
order a pizza!

999
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,891
Wait a minute... the
pizza guy's gay?!

1000
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:48,693
Pete! Don't go!

1001
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:51,261
There is some old lady
outside in a minivan

1002
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:52,262
About to lose her shit!

1003
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,098
Oh fuck, my ride's here!

1004
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,299
Your ride?!

1005
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:57,301
What did you expect me to do,
walk?

1006
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:59,303
You've got to be
fucking kidding me!

1007
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:00,470
Kelse...

1008
00:59:00,504 --> 00:59:02,272
Hello, Jon? Are you here?

1009
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:05,175
I've been waiting for half an
hour, I've been worried...

1010
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,644
- Corey?!
- Hi.

1011
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:07,878
What are you doing here?

1012
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:10,080
He lives here.
Alone, from now on.

1013
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,583
Jon, Corey - oh my God!

1014
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:13,984
Liss, it's not what
it looks like!

1015
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:16,553
It's exactly what
it looks like!

1016
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:20,124
Corey, have you been
fucking my boyfriend?

1017
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:23,628
Technically, you were
fucking my boyfriend.

1018
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:25,596
- Boyfriend? Really?
- No.

1019
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:29,033
I can't believe this, I can't
believe I trusted you!

1020
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,101
- Liss, sweetie...
- I'm talking about him!

1021
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:33,470
- Me? What about him?!
- Oh, thanks.

1022
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,472
Wait a minute - he was
upfront with me!

1023
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,742
He never tried to be a
saint... Hi.

1024
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:40,678
He just told me that, um...
No! It was you!

1025
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:42,880
I... was trying to
protect you.

1026
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,650
Well you should've
tried harder!

1027
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:47,317
No, Kelse, please don't go!

1028
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,119
I needed you tonight, but no!

1029
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:51,555
I've been trying to talk to
you for like, a week,

1030
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,023
But you're too busy,
just like always.

1031
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:53,891
Wait, Kelse!

1032
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,325
Are you happy?
You've totally destroyed

1033
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,460
My whole fucking life.

1034
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:58,462
Looks like you did that
fine on your own!

1035
00:59:58,495 --> 00:59:59,596
Lissa, wait...

1036
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,766
I bought you these!

1037
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,768
I might still have
the receipt,

1038
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,535
And maybe I can get that back.

1039
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,672
- Baby, wait...
- Oh, I am not your baby!

1040
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,674
And you are not mine!
No, you...

1041
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:10,875
Can find a ride home.

1042
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:12,409
Where am I supposed to go?

1043
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,711
I don't care!

1044
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:19,049
You two are perfect
for each other.

1045
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:45,209
Give me that!

1046
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:50,014
Hey, mom...

1047
01:00:50,047 --> 01:01:41,866
* * *

1048
01:01:41,899 --> 01:01:45,335
Did you throw up on
the stairs?

1049
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,305
It looks like a Banksy.

1050
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:51,842
I go in front of the
licensing board in a week.

1051
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:54,912
It's supposed to be
confidential, but...

1052
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:55,980
What?

1053
01:01:56,013 --> 01:02:00,684
Melissa may have mentioned
it to a few people...

1054
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,152
Online.

1055
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:04,688
Hello, internet!

1056
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,125
Have you seen this man?!

1057
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,560
Don't let him fuck
your boyfriend.

1058
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,096
Cause you know what?

1059
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:14,765
He might want to FUCK
YOUR BOYFRIEND!

1060
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,767
CAUSE HE'S A BOYFRIEND-FUCKER!

1061
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:18,936
That's what he is, he's a
boyfriend-fucker!

1062
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,772
So find him before he fucks
your boyfriend!

1063
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:24,574
Wow, that's a happy lady.

1065
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:30,080
Yeah, hating me has
gone viral.

1066
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:33,583
That's what happens when they
catch you ridin' dirty, hoss!

1067
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:35,585
Aw, don't be gross.

1068
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,387
Gross? Gross is walking in,

1069
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:40,825
Watching you work your scuzzy
ex like a Shake Weight,

1070
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,760
That's gross!

1071
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:47,932
Oh, whatever.
Oh, fuck my life!

1072
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,367
What did you end up doing
on yor birthday?

1073
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,638
Oh, y'know, shotgunned three
boxes of Chablis

1074
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:58,042
And a case of
Mexican-style Aerosol cheez.

1075
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:00,677
Officially, I still hate you.

1076
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,946
Okay.

1077
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:05,382
- But unofficially...
- I'm so sorry.

1078
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,152
I know you are. Dumb slut.

1079
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:11,822
Sex with an ex, the dirty
dance of death!

1080
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:14,859
His cock should come with
a warning label:

1081
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:18,428
"Not to be taken internally."

1082
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:24,501
Right up there.

1083
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,871
I'm going home to Tehachapi.

1084
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:29,907
Gonna live in a
trailer with mom.

1085
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,910
Probably sit out on the porch
and play a banjo.

1086
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,912
Contemplate messing
with tourists.

1087
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:37,915
- What about the...
- It's gone, Corey.

1088
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:42,319
The coffee bar's gone.
There's nothing left to do.

1089
01:03:42,352 --> 01:04:03,307
I'm going home.

1090
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:24,361

01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:32,102
I know, I know you
probably hate me,

1094
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:35,705
But I want you to know
how sorry I am.

1095
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:42,112
About your uncle, and about...
what I did.

1096
01:04:42,146 --> 01:04:47,617
God, if you were here with me,
I would just do...

Hey.

Hi.

I'm...

1101

I'm sorry if I interrupted
your phone call.

1102
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,400
Pete, I am so sorry.

1103
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:07,437
Please listen, please listen,
please...

1104
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:20,985
Look, whatever you have to
say, just say it.

1105
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,287
I'm sorry I cheated.

1106
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,656
I'm sorry for being
so selfish.

1107
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:30,360
I'm sorry about the movie.

1108
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:33,230
I'm sorry about being so
insane about my birthday.

1109
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,001
I'm sorry about hogging all
the even-numbered pretzels,

1110
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,003
It's not fair when I do that.

1111
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:44,975
I'm sorry about...

1112
01:05:45,009 --> 01:05:48,145
For the Kennedy assassination?

1113
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:52,516
"I'm sorry about
global warming."

1114
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,384
And skinny jeans?

1115
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:57,621
Yeah. My fault.

1116
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:03,793
"And most of all..."

1117
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:08,665
I'm really sorry
about your uncle.

1118
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,402
Yeah, he was a good man.

1119
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,772
Look, just forget it.
I understand what happened.

1120
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,843
Well, that makes one of us.

1121
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:24,214
We had a good start.
We had a great start.

1122
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:27,117
I just don't think either one
of us were ready.

1123
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,820
In these crazy,
stressed-out times, it's...

1124
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:33,857
Hard to really know
what matters.

1125
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:38,128
- I'm leaving town tomorrow.
- What?

1126
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:41,165
I just came her to say
goodbye.

1127
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:44,301
To this place.
To my uncle Sal.

1128
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:48,638
- No, you can't leave!
- I can't?

1129
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:51,708
Give me one good reason why.

1130
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,510
- School.
- School's out.

1131
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:56,146
- Poetry reading?
- Kelsey's is closed.

1132
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,447
- Pizzeria!
- Corey...

1133
01:06:57,481 --> 01:07:00,917
Hey, pizza is the
lifeblood of our community!

1134
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,588
The gayborhood will
starve without you!

1135
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:08,925
You don't want that on
your conscience, mister.

1136
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:13,830
- What about the bears?
- The bears?

1137
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,100
And the otters...

1138
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,768
And the twinks... the
twinks will be fine.

1139
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:20,870
They don't eat.

1140
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,106
Think about...

1141
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,441
Look, I'm going to go
to Colorado,

1142
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,677
And then down to New Mexico,
maybe Texas.

1143
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:30,380
Just, away.

1144
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:33,817
- What does it matter?
- You matter.

1145
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,421
You matter to me.

1146
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,623
I might be back at the
end of summer.

1147
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:42,092
That is so far away.

01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:47,964
- Pete...
- What?

01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:52,569

Oh. Sorry. Yes?

No, this is Corey, her
brother, may I...

No, she's out of town.

or not?

me work my

I don't understand
your system.

1174
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,623
The yellow ones are
accounts payable,

1175

And the white ones are
accounts receivable.

These are all yellow!

I'll go down there and
deal with it after.

AFTERWARDS WILL BE TOO LATE!

to pour coffee.

had to work with

sweetie.

So, who drove you this time?
My mom?

1203
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,768
Funny. Today's the day, huh?

1204
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:41,638
Yeah, this is it, time to
pay the piper.

1205
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:47,210
I'm sorry.
I feel really horrible.

1206
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,648
Hey, I'm an adult.
Today's my fault, not yours.

1207
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:56,820
Okay, I absolve you - go forth
and sin some more, my son.

1208
01:10:56,853 --> 01:11:04,828
You know if I could do
anything to fix it...

1209
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,696
That would be a miracle.

1210
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,366
I gotta go, I'm going to be
late for my own hanging.

1211

Kelse, c'mon!

01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:54,378
Why am I the damn pack mule?!

1213

So, as you can see
in Schedule C,

The projected revenue stream
in the first six months

Is consistent with growth in

In the area, as foot traffic
increases the...

During the late...
seasonally, it's...

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hm. Yep.

1219
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:17,434
I read all of it's... words.
Words!

1220
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,436
There's a lot of words.

1221
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:21,571
Did I do something wrong?

1222
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:24,741
No, no!
It's perfect.

1223
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:25,875
It's anal.

1224
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:30,647
It's loan paperwork, and
banking, and it's just... ugh.

1225
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,649
It just makes me want to barf.

01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,917
But you're a loan officer.

1227
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:38,455
That is what I do!
That is not who I am!

1228
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:42,091
You know who I am?

1229
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,093
I'M A DANCER!

[Grindr message tone]

1231
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:50,534
Oh, stop the... you gotta turn
it down, turn it down...

1232
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,169
Please, please, how
do you do it?

1233
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,439
Oh, that guy.

1234
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,941
I know that guy -
that guy came in!

1235
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,943
That guy paid off your loan!

1236
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:01,077
WHAT?!

1237
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,479
Pete paid off our loan?

1238
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,080
Yeah!
He sold his business.

1239
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,148
He closed his account.

1240
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:07,150
He paid off your balance.

1241
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,918
With so much money.

1242
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:14,223
So much sexy, sexual,
erotic... money.

1243
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:16,225
So what are we...

1244
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:17,527
- I love money.
- Yeah...

1245
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,196
Sorry to interrupt - what
are we doing here?

1246
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,432
I don't know what
you're doing here.

1247
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:25,969
But I know what
we're doing here.

1248
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:29,338
Dancing. Right? Dancing!

1249
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:35,278
What kind of bank is this?

1250
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:41,284
Oh, shit! I gotta go!

1251
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,286
Good luck at the hearing!

1252
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:52,028
I thought he'd never leave!

1253
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:55,765
It's over. They all left.

1254
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,767
I need to tell you
how sorry I am.

1255
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:01,971
- I never meant to...
- I withdrew the complaint.

1256
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,840
Why?

1257
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:07,343
A friend of ours
told me a story.

1258
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,345
What kind of story?

1259
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:15,485
Well, it was a story about
this great guy,

1260
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:18,321
Whose heart was
broken into pieces

1261
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:21,625
By this hot, horny, dumb kid,

1262
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:27,463
Who was just trying to figure
out what he wanted.

1263
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,465
How does the story end?

1264
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:33,970
You know, before this whole
situation happened,

1265
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:37,907
I didn't understand how
far you can go

1266
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,309
When you lose
someone you love.

1267
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:44,313
Or sometimes... sometimes
not far enough.

1268
01:14:44,347 --> 01:14:46,850
Yeah - I see now that you were

1269
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,852
Trying to get me to see
other people.

1270
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:51,320
But I didn't!
I didn't do enough.

1271
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:53,857
When my husband left me,

1272
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,560
I did not have a friend
in the world.

1273
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:59,262
I don't know what I would have
done without you.

1274
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,463
You would've been fine.

1275
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,265
No. You helped me
get through it.

1276
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:09,105
You helped me get out,
and try to rebuild my life.

1277
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:14,744
And it cost you.

1278
01:15:14,778 --> 01:15:23,286
You know, I just hope that
some day, you find somebody

1279
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:26,590
That helps you go
through things too.

1280
01:15:26,623 --> 01:15:31,360
Whether it be a friend,
or a love.

1281
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:37,466
Or whatever.

1282
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:41,004
I gotta go catch him.

1283
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,707
Thank you.

1284
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,309
Um, okay, so I'll
see you around.

1285
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:47,343
Professionally?

1286
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,345
Oh, not a chance in hell.

1287
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,614
Good call.

Dammit, where is he?!

1291
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:48,271
I think you found him.

1292
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:51,808
My whole life, I have waited,

1293
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:55,578
So long, for the
perfect moment.

1294
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:59,115
The perfect,
cookie-cutter life.

01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,887
Corey...

1298
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,991
But all I want to say, is that
when we're together,

1299
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:13,462
Every moment is the
perfect moment.

1300
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:14,764
So...

1301
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:23,006
Where do you want to go first?

1302
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,574
Anywhere.

1303
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:26,910
Everywhere.

1304
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:30,479
Right now? Right this second?

1305
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:34,117
KELSEY, I'M RUNNING
AWAY WITH PETE!

1306
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,619
And I don't know when I'm
going to be back!

1307
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:40,589
A few weeks, or a
few months...

1308
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:47,430
Or whatever!

- I love you, sis!

Where do you want to go first?

1314
