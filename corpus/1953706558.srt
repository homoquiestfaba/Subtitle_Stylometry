1
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,999
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,934
You looking for
a little Scrabble action?

3
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,269
- You a player?
- A little.

4
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,670
We use Scrabble clocks.

5
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,539
Once you've placed all
the letters, you hit the timer.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,940
You have 25 minutes.

7
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,442
If you go over, there's
a 10 point penalty.

8
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,177
- Per minute.
- We use American English only.

9
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,113
If it's not in this book,
it's not a word.

10
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,968
Wow!

11
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,538
Tohzah.

12
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,543
T-O-H-Z-A-H.

13
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,145
Tohzah. Tohzah.

14
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,914
T-O-H...

15
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,350
I'm gonna get you, Tohzah.

16
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,486
Not anything backwards.
Not Hebrew.

17
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,890
What is Tohzah?

18
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,258
Not Arabic.

19
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,560
You are an enigma!

20
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,497
Are you a tit-man?

21
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,539
Klingon!

22
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,578
This guy in Skokie tried getting

23
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,815
a plate with the F-word
written in Klingon.

24
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,628
Hi Katie. It's me.

25
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,296
You coming to my dad's birthday?

26
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,798
Yeah. That's coming up.

27
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,832
It's five weeks away, Zoe.

28
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,667
If you're coming,
you need to RSVP

29
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,469
and make definitive
plans to be there.

30
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,005
Yeah. Wow.
So, what're you gonna get him?

31
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,840
Something nice
that he will cherish.

32
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,209
Anyway, how are the kids?

33
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,545
Look. I... I need to go.
I'm really busy today.

34
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,780
Okay. Well, say 'hi'
to the kids for-

35
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,516
me.

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,088
Your safety is important.

37
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,123
If you observe
unattended packages,

38
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,125
vandalism,
or suspicious activity,

39
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,127
inform C.T.A...

40
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,175
Jesus came to me again, Marty.

41
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,711
Marty!

42
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,113
Jesus came to me again.

43
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,716
Really, Lewis? Wow.

44
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,652
This time he came in the form
of a giant rooster.

45
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,521
Rooster, huh?

46
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,191
I asked him why it is
he put us on this Earth.

47
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,860
Good question, Lewis!

48
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,729
You know what he said?

49
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,932
Well, you know what he said?

50
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,068
The Jesus-rooster? No clue.

51
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,969
He said he couldn't remember.

52
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,939
He said I should
ask him again later.

53
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:45,544
Ask again later? What?
Jesus is a magic 8-ball now?

54
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,745
That sucks.

55
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,214
Well, he's been through a lot.

56
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,285
Hey! Hey you!

57
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,521
Did you know
Jesus is a magic 8-ball?

58
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,523
Hey!

59
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,535
- Hey, Mart.
- Hey, Bear.

60
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,637
You brought your lunch.
That's smart, man.

61
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,206
I never bring my lunch.

62
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,640
And I get all hungry
and I gotta spend

63
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,808
$2.50 at the vending machine

64
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,776
for Frito-Lay's.

65
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,444
That's why I'm fat.

66
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,647
Frito-Lay's, man. Whatchoo got?

67
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,482
Sandwich.

68
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,916
What're you both doing here?

69
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,852
You're not both
supposed to be here.

70
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,286
Whose shift is it?

71
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,358
Marty, you're not supposed
to be here.

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,826
I got you down for tomorrow.

73
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,129
- Day shift. 9 a.m.
- Seriously?

74
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,632
- Yeah. It's on the calendar!
- During the day?

75
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,034
- Yeah.
- With people?

76
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,805
- Hey! You wanna switch?
- What's the problem?

77
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,207
Come on, man.
That's why I make this schedule.

78
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,942
For you to look at,
not for my health.

79
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,748
We are live at the N.S.C.

80
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,016
The Nation Scrabble
Championship.

81
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,252
And man, things were
heating up inside there!

82
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,920
Letters were flying
left and right.

83
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:06,491
Dirk Frankie, you cannot catch a
break. Three-time runner up.

84
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:10,762
My bad. How does it
feel to always be

85
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,297
the bridesmaid
yet, never the bride?

86
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,867
Oh. Cut the witticisms.
That is luck that Williams won.

87
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,003
He's dancing around the two
letter words like it's...

88
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:18,870
December.

89
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,405
And then he just happens
to luck out

90
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,773
on saving his Z to the very end.

91
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,409
That's just... That's ridiculous,
okay? I got two bingos!

92
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,012
Yes. Can't let those be
forgotten. Alright, Dirk.

93
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,780
Are you gonna be giving it
another go?

94
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,450
Or has Vanna
turned your last letter?

95
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,585
I will spell to the death!

96
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,954
Oo! We've got Bill Williams,
this year's winner.

97
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,422
Uh... Best luck to you
next time, Dirk.

98
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,791
Bill! Bill! Could you come on
over here. Congratulations!

99
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,060
Bill, gotta a couple of
questions for you.
Wanna find out first,

100
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,529
how did you manage to
pull it off?

101
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,164
I don't know.
I honestly didn't think

102
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,833
I'd make it out of
the quarter-finals.

103
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,502
I was playing a master.
I think the stress got to him.

104
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,705
He played "Kim Jong-Il." That's
clearly a Star Wars character.

105
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,407
You can't do proper nouns.
And I squeaked out.

106
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,641
Uh, made it
to the next round,

107
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,943
and the streak kept going.
- What?

108
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,878
We've got a lot of folks who
are watching at home.

109
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,146
- You need arms.

110
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,314
Possibly some kids who are
thinking about

111
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,648
giving Scrabble
tournament play a try.

112
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,283
Any advice for the youngsters?

113
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,653
Yeah, I guess I would say... Um
Go for it! Follow your dreams.

114
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,989
You know. There- there's a lot
to be learned

115
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,324
from the Scrabble board.

116
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,526
Uh, character.
You know. Courage.

117
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,661
Stuff like that
and uh... and so...

118
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,364
Just, you know, do it.
And, and um...

119
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,400
regardless of what your
friends call you.

120
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,065
Rookie mistake, Ethel.

121
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:31,970
This is why I beat you
week after week... after week.

122
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,038
My name's Nancy

123
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,042
Not today, it's not. Today,
your name is...

124
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,710
Loser.

125
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,047
--Ew.

126
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:43,815
Excuse me?

127
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,717
You didn't even do it right.

128
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,721
Backwards! You did it backwards.

129
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,726
I'm leaving. Okay, Ethel?

130
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,730
Don't be late next week.

131
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,735
- Are you waiting for a game?
- No, thank you.

132
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,677
Marty, you're filling in for
Dean today.

133
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,945
Menswear, second floor.

134
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,153
Did you wash your hair
this morning?

135
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,728
Wear this. You look like shit.

136
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,884
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I could find

137
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,953
lady's foundations?

138
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,267
Excuse me. If you were my dad,
well, my step-dad,

139
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,237
what would you like?
The flask or the belt?

140
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,207
His 60th birthday, so
I guess it's kind of a biggie.

141
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,710
Um...

142
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,313
Oh, never mind. You're not
an asshole. How would you know?

143
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,050
- Have you tried Fetish for Men?
- No, thank you.

144
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,285
- It's scent-sational!
- I'm allergic to perfume!

145
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,988
- Oh no. It's cologne.

146
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,726
Hey! What? Are you just
gonna stand there?

147
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,733
That's great, buddy.
Lot of help.

148
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,219
- Maybe it's a sock.
- I'm hoping it's not.

149
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,224
- I think he had a bikini wax.
- Y-you you gotta be kidding.

150
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,327
We think it's a sock.

151
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,665
Fifty-five dollars!
How can this be happening?!

152
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,067
- Fifty-five dollars
for underwear?

153
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,002
Sure.
- It's designer.

154
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,671
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

155
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:25,844
This! This! Definitely that...
is insanity people!

156
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,712
What? You! What're you doing?

157
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,248
- Um, buying underwear.
- No

158
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,684
- You don't want this.
- Yes, I do!

159
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,153
No, no, no, no, no.
Why do you want them?

160
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,956
- I- I like the ad!

161
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,059
The ad is designed to trick you

162
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,262
into paying 55 goddamn
dollars for underwear!

163
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,697
Please, give me my underwear.

164
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:50,835
No! You can't have that lying,
cheating, thieving underwear!

165
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,338
What're you...
What're you doing, man?

166
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,140
You're better
than the underwear.

167
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,075
You deserve more!

168
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,811
You're better
than your underwear.

169
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,814
Do you hear me?
Come on! Everyone!

170
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,485
Say it with me! You're better
than your underwear.

171
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,387
Come on!
Say it with me!

172
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,292
Come on! You're better
than your underwear! Come on!

173
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,194
Everybody!

174
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,097
You're better than
your underwear!

175
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,967
You're better than your
underwear! Come on!

176
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,335
I'm better than
my underwear.

177
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,704
Yes! Yes! You, sneezing lady!

178
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,241
Definitely better than your
underwear. Wait!

179
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,443
Wait a minute! Goddammit,
I work here!

180
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,045
Where's the
sneezing woman?

181
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,817
Come on guys! Come on.
This is ridiculous!

182
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,952
Come on! I work here nights!

183
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,228
Causing a scene like that
in front of paying customers!

184
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,831
Freedom of speech, man.

185
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,332
Who's in charge here?

186
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,668
Uh, is there something I can
help you with, miss?

187
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,103
- I demand you release this man!
- -: Excuse me?

188
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,207
I'm a paying customer. I bought
all kinds of crap here today...

189
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,643
and this man...
- I saved her life.

190
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:09,647
- Mm-hmm. When I... when I was...
- Having trouble breathing!

191
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,983
- B-because of all the... cologne!
- Perfume!

192
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,953
- Evil perfume bitch!
- She sprayed me.

193
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,054
Right in her face!

194
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,655
- And I'm allergic
and I kept sneezing.

195
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,757
- Cologne and perfume
are the same thing!

196
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,026
- It was horrible!
- She could sue.

197
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,663
But this man, he was the
only one to help me.

198
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,099
- Miss, he tried to cause a riot
in men's underwear.

199
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,667
I should have him arrested.

200
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,737
- What!?
- $55 for underwear?

201
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,074
- No ass is worth that much!
- I agree.

202
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,645
Go away, you're fired.
- Fired?

203
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:45,850
Fired. Now leave. Both of you.

204
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,254
I don't want either one of you
in my store again.

205
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,991
Oh. And, Marty.

206
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,934
- I don't normally do this.
- What're you gonna do?

207
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,969
- No, I mean I don't normally do
what I did back there.

208
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,671
I'm not about to do anything.

209
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,173
Oh.

210
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,981
Well, this is my stop.
This is where I... take the bus.

211
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,952
- Okay. Okay.

212
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,456
Thanks again.

213
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,993
Sure. Yeah.

214
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,963
See you around.

215
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,970
Okay.

216
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,740
- Hey, you hungry?
- Yes!

217
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,978
- 'Cause I could eat.
- Sounds great.

218
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,114
I'm Zoe Rezillo.

219
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,950
I'm Marty Huckhound.

220
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,286
Nice to meet you,
Marty Huckhound.

221
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,094
So, if I wanted a plate that
said, "Screw you,"

222
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,428
you wouldn't let me?

223
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,132
No, too offensive.
Plus too many letters.

224
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,900
- I don't
have a car anyways.

225
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,235
People try stuff
all the time and

226
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,004
the computer spits out
the obvious stuff,

227
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,705
but it's up to me
to catch the rest.

228
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,973
- Did you go to
college for that?

229
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,175
No, I was standing in line
once at the DMV

230
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,345
and this guy in front of me
was trying to get a dirty plate.

231
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,315
So, you um, ratted some guy out?

232
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:01,352
No. His plate said 4-K-U.
You know, fork you...

233
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,288
and I was complementing him and
then the supervisor came over

234
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,024
and handed me the job
on the spot.

235
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:10,395
Wow. That's impressive.

236
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,063
People used to make fun of me

237
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,965
for playing Scrabble
all the time.

238
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,603
What's the dirtiest,
filthiest thing

239
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,905
anybody has ever
wanted on a plate?

240
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,707
I have to write it out for you.

241
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,642
- Okay.
- Okay.

242
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,952
I don't get it.

243
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,456
Okay. Get rid of the space.
And then picture

244
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,324
how the 5's can look like S's.

245
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,862
Oh. Ass-orgy. That is filthy.

246
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,297
Oh. You wanna see
something cool?

247
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,800
Is it cooler than ass-orgy?

248
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,335
I'll show you what
your name spells.

249
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,042
Okay. That's Marty Huckhound.

250
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,947
Dormant. Yuck. Huh.

251
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,949
Dormant yuck?

252
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,318
Okay. Wait. Hang on.

253
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,456
A mucky hord hunt.

254
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,326
A mucky thud horn.

255
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,330
Okay. Wait. No. Don't go away.
Got it.

256
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,168
Had mucky no hurt.

257
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,871
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

258
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,842
I don't know, but Mucky is my
new name for you.

259
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,444
You're real smart, huh?

260
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,847
Only with words and letters
and stuff.

261
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,582
Nothing terribly useful.

262
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,051
No. I'm useless.

263
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,054
I can only curse
in one goddamn language.

264
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,723
But you do it so well.

265
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:57,969
Wow. This is kind of dangerous.

266
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,338
I love it here.

267
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,908
Especially in the winter when
it's covered in ice

268
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,977
and the
water is practically black.

269
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,482
It's dark and eerie,
but in a really beautiful way.

270
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,053
You know, if you slip and fall,
even in March,

271
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,488
you're pretty much dead.

272
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,725
And anyone who jumps in after
you, they'll die too.

273
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,961
Every now and then though,

274
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,396
you hear these stories
about kids

275
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,331
who fall in for like
twenty minutes...

276
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,966
...and they end up living,

277
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,936
because their body temperature's
have lowered so much...

278
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,906
they're in like a zen
state or something.

279
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,343
Does that work on adults, too?

280
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,079
I don't think so.

281
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,982
I think they know too much.

282
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,622
I remember the first time I came
here when I was a teenager.

283
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,625
I totally wanted to jump.

284
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,630
Yeah, I know that feeling.

285
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,836
Well, here's my car.

286
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,273
You don't have a
personalized plate.

287
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,842
Nah. I couldn't think of
anything good to say.

288
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,983
- I have to work tomorrow. So...
- Well, I got this bus...

289
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,522
- Well you can give me your...
- I don't have a phone.

290
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,958
Well, I... I could
give you mine...

291
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,859
and you could use a pay phone.

292
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,028
- Yeah!
- Okay. Hold on. Here,

293
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,064
I'll write it down.

294
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,971
Okay.

295
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,773
- That's me. Zoe.
- Okay.

296
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,675
Ah, there's my
cell phone number.

297
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,911
And my cell doesn't have
reception at home.

298
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,280
So, just call this number
and that's my email.

299
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,348
Mmhmm.

300
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,619
Well, thanks for having
lunch with me.

301
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,520
Yea... Yeah. Sure. And...

302
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,956
thanks for the whole
getting me fired thing.

303
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,425
Yeah. Sure. Anytime.

304
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,327
Great.

305
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,832
So...

306
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,101
Call her, Marty.
Jesus wants you to.

307
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,705
Jesus also wants you to leave
your door unlocked tonight

308
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,741
so he and I can crash
at your place.

309
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,254
What're you guys doing
this weekend?

310
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,022
There's a concert on Saturday.
Wanna come?

311
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,640
You're so funny.

312
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:27,278
Well, then I went looking up at
the sky and then... Bam.

313
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,382
Just a little joke there, but...

314
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,991
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi!

315
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,259
Mucky.

316
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,328
- Hey there.
- What're you doing here?

317
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,965
Um. I'm horse shit on the phone.

318
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,736
Oh so you just decided to
come by my work?

319
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,341
Yeah... I'm not stalking
you or anything.

320
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,642
No. It's ok.

321
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,979
My grandma once told me that my
grandpa used to stalk her,

322
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,482
but back then it was
called courtship.

323
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,953
Yeah. O-okay.

324
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,455
So, how long have you been here?

325
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,726
Long enough to realize I don't
like your co-workers very much.

326
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,728
Yeah. I don't like
them much either.

327
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,332
- Like, that guy.
- That's Ken.

328
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,434
Ken's an asshole.

329
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,669
It's hard to believe
there hasn't been

330
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,405
an office shooting, yet.

331
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,341
"Hi. I'm Ken."

332
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,978
"I like it when people
jerk on my tie."

333
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,681
"I like to sleep with my
friends' pregnant wives

334
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,517
when they're out of town."

335
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,853
"Suckle from their swelling
teets."

336
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:47,224
"I keep jars of STD's in my
fridge.

337
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,460
I have eighteen rare
strains of chlamydia."

338
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:53,364
"Hahahahaha."

339
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,333
That guy makes fun of
me all the time.

340
00:23:56,868 --> 00:24:00,337
I kind of wish he'd just curl up
and die and go to hell.

341
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,844
Well,

342
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm sorry you missed my lunch.
We could've sat out here

343
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,750
and looked at the clouds
or something.

344
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,285
I like to do that sometimes.

345
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,653
Oh man.

346
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,256
You're one of those people
who see stuff in clouds like...

347
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:23,127
kittens and bunnies and
president's heads and shit, huh?

348
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,064
One of those people? Mucky,
everyone sees stuff in clouds.

349
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,366
I don't.

350
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,468
Never?

351
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,836
No. Never.

352
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,572
Well, you should try sometime.

353
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,908
No.

354
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,344
Okay.

355
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,648
We should go to dinner
tomorrow night.

356
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,383
We should?

357
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,756
Yeah. Why don't you come over to
my place at seven?

358
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,725
And we'll eat.

359
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,928
At a restaurant... together.

360
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,464
Doesn't that sound nice?

361
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:05,069
Yeah. Nice.

362
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,842
Well...

363
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,279
...shit.

364
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,062
Hi, Mucky.

365
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,798
Wow. You look really nice.

366
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,501
Thank you. You look....

367
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,905
Really, really nice.

368
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,606
Thank you.

369
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,808
I was gonna get you flowers,

370
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,845
but all the ones I could afford
looked like shit.

371
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,480
And then I remembered the
sneezing thing.

372
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,216
Yeah. Flowers are bad.
Balloons are great.

373
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,084
You're not allergic to latex,
are you?

374
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,219
No. I love it.

375
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,754
The balloon, I mean.

376
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:08,399
I have a coupon. So, you might
as well look at your menu.

377
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,737
I'm gonna get a goddam job soon,
you know?

378
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,739
I know.

379
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,909
Places like this make me
feel like shit.

380
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,112
Why?

381
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,082
I don't know.

382
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,420
My dad used to take me to
places like this

383
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,188
...when he won at the track.

384
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,758
He always wanted to fit in,
you know?

385
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,194
be just like them,
but we weren't.

386
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,063
Not even close.

387
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,232
And I never want to be
like my dad, so...

388
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,735
I never want to be like
these people.

389
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,407
But they look so happy.

390
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,282
"I simply must have that
Mercedes in medium sky-blue.

391
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,685
Not light sky-blue,
and not dark sky-blue."

392
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:07,324
"I need those papers on my desk
by seven a.m. sharp. No excuses.

393
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,128
"And how was your day,
Chazwick?"

394
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,099
"I sold some stocks.
And some bonds...

395
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,069
and then, I shot three under
par-r-r at the club."

396
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,071
"Hmph. Lovely."

397
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,506
"And you?"

398
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,310
"I had my nails done
and lunched with the girls."

399
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,213
"I myself took a..."

400
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:35,419
"a long, long lunch. And, um,
bought myself a new suit."

401
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,188
"My, don't you look dapper."

402
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,758
"Thank you."

403
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,729
And how, how was Zoe's day?

404
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,405
I played a game of Scrabble
and scored three bingos!

405
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,741
Wait, were you... were you
playing Scrabble or bingo?

406
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,277
Bingo's when you use
all 7 tiles in one word.

407
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,679
- Oh!

408
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,949
That is amazing. And I managed
to go all the live-long day

409
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:09,019
without referring
to someone as an asshole.

410
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,020
That's amazing!

411
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,723
Yes. I also met
this fine gentleman

412
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,693
at a job interview
who shared my passion

413
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,327
for pistachios.

414
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,929
We're going into business
together.

415
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,831
I'll be a millionaire
by the end of the week.

416
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,032
That's nuts!

417
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,036
Yes. I'll be King of the nuts.

418
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,908
Sounds like we've both had a
really good day.

419
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,744
Yeah.

420
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,272
I had fun tonight, Mucky.

421
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:03,741
Yeah.

422
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,076
It didn't suck.

423
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,078
Thanks.

424
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,747
You're welcome.

425
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,919
Woo!

426
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,158
Thank God you bought that
family-size box of condoms.

427
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:59,897
That's the first time wishful
thinking has ever paid off!

428
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,967
Plus you save a lot when
you buy in bulk.

429
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,878
Finally, pizza! I'm starving.

430
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,681
God damn 'im.

431
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,483
he's supposed to fucking
take the money

432
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,018
from underneath the mat
and leave the pizza.

433
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:27,891
Dammit! Can't anybody follow
directions anymore!?!

434
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,928
Leave the pizza, take the money!

435
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,996
The guy from Hong Kong Kitchen
last night

436
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,398
knew what the
hell he was doing!

437
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,000
Take the pizza, leave the money!

438
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,870
Reverse it, flip it, put it on
your dick and stick it!

439
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,872
Oh my God!

440
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,243
Why would Mom think I was dead?

441
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,745
Because your work called and
told her you were dead.

442
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,048
- They called Mom?
- Yes, they called your mother.

443
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,050
- And she sent you?
- Yes.

444
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,153
Well, tell her I'm fine. I just
forgot to charge my phone.

445
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,855
For three days?

446
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,892
Who's the homeless guy?

447
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,295
- He's
- Your boyfriend?

448
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,897
Well I hope he's got a job,

449
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,332
because you're obviously not
going to have one anymore.

450
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,701
I haven't taken a vacation day
in three years.

451
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,103
You know this was a really bad
day to pull this shit, Zoe.

452
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,975
the kids have...
forget it.

453
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,748
Well I'm glad I'm alive!

454
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,683
What's one more day?

455
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,785
If they think I'm dead, they'll
hire someone else.

456
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,922
- Can anyone else do your job?
- Mucky.

457
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,792
Look, once you leave this
apartment, you'll be out there,

458
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,495
and you'll realize what a
huge mistake you've made,

459
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,932
and then you will never, ever
come back here to me.

460
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,868
I think you should go
to your apartment

461
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,538
and pack up
all your stuff.

462
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,640
What?

463
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:54,111
Pack it up, haul it over,
I have plenty of room here.

464
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,513
You know I'm not
exactly housebroken.

465
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,548
What, you're going to
pee on my rug?

466
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,817
- I'll get you a litter box.

467
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,424
What if your bitch
sister comes back?

468
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,727
She's not the bitch,
she's the nice one.

469
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,536
You know that's very funny,

470
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,506
because I've actually been
studying this uh, art...

471
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,108
...it's called Tantra.
- Oh really?

472
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,210
It's very sensual...

473
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,881
Are you serious?

474
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,218
Oh my three's company!

475
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,653
Too much Me TV.

476
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,823
It's like she just raided Mr.
Roper's closet of death.

477
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,458
I can hear you.

478
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,927
Oh, I'm sorry, we thought
you were dead.

479
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:48,332
No, I wasn't dead.
I was having sex.

480
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,501
For thirty-six hours...
and eating take-out.

481
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,470
With who?

482
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,605
My boyfriend.

483
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,842
Oh really, your boyfriend?

484
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,544
Yeah, my boyfriend.

485
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,713
Oh, and I told him
all about you Ken,

486
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,247
and he thinks
you're an asshole.

487
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,484
- What's your boyfriend's name?
- Yeah, anyone we know?

488
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,754
No, you don't know him...
His name is Marty Huckhound.

489
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:15,392
Oh, and do I have to worry about
Marty Huckhound beating me up?

490
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,394
I don't know, I think he might
be bigger than you Ken,

491
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,696
but he's
probably from Canada!

492
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,468
Bunch of goddamn teenagers!
Uuuhhh!

493
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,773
Oh, that was good...
So back to this back rub...

494
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,241
You're here!

495
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,810
You decided to move in.

496
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,814
I got you a present.

497
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,918
- Ta daaah
- A sock!

498
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,756
I love it. To make sock monkeys.

499
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,292
There's a matching
one in the bag.

500
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,762
I saw you had a monkey
with no arms.

501
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,664
Yeah.

502
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,568
What do you want to name it?

503
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,670
Uhhhh, I don't.

504
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,906
But you have to name him.
You gave him his arms.

505
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,775
Ummm, Mr. Sock.

506
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:44,281
Uh, okay. Doctor
Foot-Sheath the Third.

507
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:50,320
Uh, Goddamn monkey-face,
demon-boy!

508
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,657
Do you like that name?

509
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,159
Tell Mucky you like that name.

510
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,327
No, no monkey!

511
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,563
- Mucky you're not afraid
of monkeys are you?

512
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,731
- They're evil.
- They're socks!

513
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,671
So you are scared of
sock-monkeys...

514
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,741
and you bought me socks,
knowing full well
what I'd turn them into?

515
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,911
That is so sweet.

516
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,548
- I'm scared
of a lot of things too.
- Like what?

517
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,719
Like global warming, or plaid,
or briefcases...

518
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,189
Ahhh! Mucky, did you know
there's a man on our patio?

519
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,827
He kinda slept at my place,
and now I don't have a my place.

520
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,696
Wait, this is all your stuff?

521
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,432
There's an empty jar of
peanut butter there.

522
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:41,571
Hi, I'm Zoe.

523
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,608
I'm Lewis.

524
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,811
Hi Lewis, nice to meet you.

525
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,447
I hope you're hungry.

526
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,887
Are you a child of the Lord?

527
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,222
Excuse me?

528
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,658
Are you a child of the Lord?

529
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,695
I thought you were talking
to the sandwich.

530
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,900
You sure act like one.

531
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,083
Marty, this is Mr. Davies.

532
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,120
He has a few questions for you
about your application.

533
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,488
Uh, thanks for seeing me, man.

534
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,394
Zoe recommends you, and
I'd really like to hire you.

535
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,497
They've got me doing
this job now,

536
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,900
and I don't know how much
longer I can take it.

537
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,079
Are you good with people?

538
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,481
Uh yeah, I guess.

539
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,383
Because the people you will be
working with are quite frankly

540
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,851
horrible, awful people

541
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,353
who want nothing more

542
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,655
than to take all of life's
frustrations out onto you.

543
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:43,360
Yeah, people can be
real assholes.

544
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,929
You ever kill a man, Marty?

545
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,031
Nope, can't say I have.

546
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,834
Excellent. You're hired.
You start now. Follow me.

547
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,375
Okay.

548
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,579
This is invalid.

549
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,282
You need to fill out form 2010.

550
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,119
Not here. Fill it out and
get back in line.

551
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,254
I've been in line
for four hours.

552
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:14,491
If you've got any complaints,
save it for Mr. Huckhound.

553
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,426
I'll tell you what, lady!

554
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:19,796
Tell your kid not to run three
red lights on his driver's test

555
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,399
...maybe then the little
darling will pass!

556
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,701
Next!

557
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,903
And what's your problem?

558
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,773
I got a ticket, even though
I fed the meter!

559
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,709
You say you fed the meter,
I say potah-to.

560
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:33,810
Next!

561
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,518
Oop, sorry, you're late.
Everybody just left.

562
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,554
That's okay, I was just...
walking by.

563
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,489
Hey, you look familiar.

564
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,893
I think I just look
like someone else.

565
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,829
You're one of us, I can tell.

566
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,732
Here.
You should join us sometime.

567
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,837
Thanks.

568
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,847
- Okay are you relaxed?
- Yep

569
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,085
Okay, what do you see?

570
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,823
Nothing.

571
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,425
Try harder.

572
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,500
Yup, Yup. Nothing.

573
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,970
OK, look over there.

574
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,707
- Mmm hmm, mm hmmm...
- It's an angel.

575
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,111
Oh wait,

576
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,915
I think I see something.
Right there, right?

577
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,084
Yeah, you see the row,

578
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,720
and the feathery wings.
- I see it! I see it!

579
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,525
Yeah, yeah, it's um, it's big,
and it's white, and it's blobby,

580
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,261
It's a cloud!

581
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,833
It's a goddamn cloud.

582
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,469
You weren't hearing a word
I was saying were you?

583
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,838
Sometimes you look
like a ballerina.

584
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,145
C'mon, you've lived here
for three weeks

585
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,682
now you know
where this stuff goes.
Come help me.

586
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,820
I love you.

587
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:02,459
I know, I love you too.
Come help me.

588
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,359
What you fail to realize

589
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:39,062
is that this is
the Department
of Motor Vehicles,

590
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,764
not the Department
of Fuck Faces!

591
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:45,935
So get your balls out of my face
with your tea bagger shit.

592
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:49,906
You want to drive a car? Get in
line. Get your picture taken.

593
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:55,078
Okay? Yes, it goes in a
computer. Yes, it keeps
track of you.

594
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,215
No, it's not socialist.
No, it's not communist.

595
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:02,752
But if you're not nice, I'll get
my good buddy Dwayne back there

596
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:06,923
to photoshop a pearl necklace
on it and post it all over
the internet!

597
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,992
Outta here!

598
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,494
Next!

599
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,899
And what the fuck do you want?

600
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,534
Hi Mucky, it's me.

601
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:20,970
I'm going to the library today
at lunch, do you want me to
get you anything?

602
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:26,209
Ummm, maybe some
hardcore bondage porn,

603
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,479
Juicyfruits, Tylenol,
definitely.

604
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:31,781
I don't think the
library has any porn.

605
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,950
- Maybe some condoms.
- Or condoms.

606
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,154
Actually, they might have some
condoms in the bathroom. I've
never noticed. I'll check.

607
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,557
Ok, ribbed for her pleasure,
if they have it.

608
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,692
Freak. Bye.

609
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,163
What?

610
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,287
See if you'd made that a D
instead of an S,

611
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,823
you would have
switched it around
and had 'Decor'

612
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,059
which would have left
your O open.
- Yeah.

613
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,261
- Hi! -Hi.

614
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,063
You looking for a little
Scrabble action?

615
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:20,897
You a player?

616
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,633
First person we've had
under 50 in a while.

617
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,735
Let's make this fast,
I gotta get back to work.

618
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,237
- Hi, I'm Holly.
- Hi.

619
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,974
This is Amber and Nancy.
That's Jake.

620
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:33,176
We are die-hard word nerds.

621
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,778
I'm Zoe, I'm on my
lunch break too.

622
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,313
- We use Scrabble clocks.

623
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,016
If it's not in this book,
it's not a word.

624
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,459
Wow!

625
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,228
- Word Nerds?
- I beat them both.

626
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,997
I mean, I beat them bad.

627
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:57,433
That's great, you're queen
of the word nerds.

628
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,901
There's more.

629
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,904
I did something today that
I've always wanted to do.

630
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,509
I entered the National
Scrabble Championships.

631
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,312
Is that real?

632
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,381
Really, you're kidding me?

633
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:14,017
No, I'm not kidding, but now
I'm kinda freaking out about it.

634
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,254
Why? You're the only person
I know who could spell....

635
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,990
7 words that start with Q
and don't use U?

636
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:26,162
Qaid, qat, qanat, qiviut,
qintar, qoph, qwerty.

637
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,565
Qwerty? What's a qwerty?

638
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,934
It's the standard
English keyboard.

639
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,203
Qwerty. It's the top
row of letters.

640
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,407
- You're not even making that up.

641
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:42,478
You are... really... really...
smart.

642
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,415
Oh, no. Q words, that's just
yellow belt shit.

643
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,550
You just have to have those
words memorized or
you're screwed.

644
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:50,553
A Q is worth 10 points, you
don't want to be stuck
with it at the end.

645
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:54,490
I bet you'll beat all
those other word weirdos.

646
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,671
Marty!

647
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,375
Hey Lewis.

648
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,210
I been looking for you.

649
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,213
You forgot the sandwich
Zoe made for you.

650
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,483
Do you know the temperature
of the water today, Lewis?

651
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,085
No.

652
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,387
It's 35 degrees.

653
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:36,259
You know how cold
the water has to be
to kill you of hypothermia?

654
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,493
No.

655
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,328
Anything under your body
temperature

656
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,165
and you'll get
hypothermia if you're in
it long enough.

657
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:47,203
Anything under 40 degrees, and
you'll lose use of your limbs
within 2 minutes.

658
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,072
She made one for me too.

659
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,310
I'm not sure which one is yours
and which one is mine.

660
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,345
Mine's probably got wheat bread.

661
00:46:56,347 --> 00:47:00,049
She asked me whether I like
white or wheat bread,
and I said white.

662
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,552
She said I should eat wheat
because it's better for me.

663
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,022
That Zoe, she's a good woman.

664
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,357
Yeah.

665
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,660
What the hell's she
doing with me, Lewis?

666
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,497
I'm sure she'll wise up any
minute now and leave.

667
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,378
Do you like ferrets, Lewis?

668
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,649
Most people think they're
rodents, but they're not.

669
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,051
No way.

670
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:37,553
You know they're
illegal in 14 states?

671
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,455
Ummm... No.

672
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,023
Yeah.

673
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,995
When I was a kid,
my mom had a litter of them.

674
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:53,302
It was summer, and after school,
I was supposed to bring
the babies in from outside.

675
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,473
But I forgot,
'cause I was watching TV.

676
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:04,146
Well, when I remembered,
I went out and I got the box...

677
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,682
I brought them inside and
I went back to watching TV...

678
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,152
'cause, the ferrets were boring.

679
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,457
Then my mom got home.

680
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:18,060
She went, looked in the box,
and guess what?

681
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,130
They were all dead.

682
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,199
All of them.

683
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,334
They were in the sun too long.

684
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,639
Do you know what
I'm saying, Lewis?

685
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,707
Do you know what
I'm trying to tell you?

686
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:35,011
Uhhh... I guess it's
like a parable?

687
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,312
Exactly.

688
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:40,182
Ummm, Zoe's like the
Good Samaritan,

689
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,587
and, I'm the... the...

690
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,522
The ferrets?

691
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:50,493
No! No, Lewis.
Zoe is the ferrets....

692
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,296
and... forget the Samaritan!

693
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,366
I'm the me, Zoe's the ferrets.

694
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:59,435
I kill ferrets.

695
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,871
I ruin everything that is good.

696
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,441
Everything I love, I ruin.

697
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,743
And I loved those ferrets.

698
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:10,479
I thought you said the
ferrets were boring.

699
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:23,125
I'm supposed to meet Zoe's
parents tonight.

700
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,296
Then you better not
jump in the lake.

701
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,616
God Damn!

702
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,252
You grew up here? Nice.

703
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:53,255
Oh! Fire in the fireplace.

704
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,124
You know I've never actually
seen that before.

705
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,793
Would you please get out of the
bushes? They'll call the police.

706
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,729
You mean they don't
know I'm coming?

707
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:03,366
Oh, this is gonna be
a goddamn barrel of laughs.

708
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:07,169
Katie already thinks
I'm a cross-dressing,
homeless serial killer.

709
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,172
Oh, it's only you.

710
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,241
One of the kids
thought he saw
Bigfoot in the window.

711
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,745
Katie, you remember Marty.
Marty, Katie.

712
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:20,516
It never occurred to me
you'd actually bring him.

713
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,686
Virginia is going to have to
set another place at the table.

714
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,621
You guys even have a maid?

715
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,323
Virginia is my mother.

716
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:30,593
Just stay close to me, OK?
Let's get this over with.

717
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,562
Zoe, who's this?

718
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,865
Lizzy, this is my boyfriend,
Marty.

719
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,933
Marty, this is
my oldest sister, Lizzy.

720
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,404
Since when are boyfriends
allowed at Daddy's birthday?

721
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:44,240
I didn't even bring Grant
until we were engaged.

722
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,411
- Hey um, how many boyfriends
has Zoe had?

723
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,112
Marty.

724
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,848
Only one that I remember.
What was his name?

725
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,583
Gordy something or other?

726
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:55,918
Had a limp.

727
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,154
Whatever became of him, Zoe?

728
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:00,222
He cheated on me.

729
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,492
Yes, that's right.

730
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,864
Zoe, is that you?
I need you in the kitchen.

731
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,400
Ahhh ahh! Are you bigfoot?

732
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:15,671
No, I am Marty, who are you?

733
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:19,275
This little guy is Luke,

734
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:21,210
and I'm Jonathan,
Katie's husband.

735
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:23,512
Marty, Zoe's boyfriend.

736
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,749
Ahh, nice. Well, welcome to the
annual nice of awkwardness.

737
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:31,687
Hey, is the old guy as big an
A-hole as he looks?

738
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:35,558
You might watch that, he can
probably hear you.

739
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,495
...roll me over, lay me down
and do it again.

740
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,434
Ha ha ha ha.

741
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,742
Marty, how did you meet our Zoe?

742
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,278
Ummm... at work I guess.

743
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,713
Yeah, I was shopping at the mall

744
00:51:57,715 --> 00:52:00,449
and I saw Marty working
in the men's department.

745
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,818
You sell men's socks, Marty?

746
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,488
No, Bob.

747
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,792
I was working security, but now
I work at the DMV with Zoe.

748
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,261
You look for dirty
words all day too?

749
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:15,531
No, Marty is second in command
at the public affairs office.

750
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,600
Well, that sounds like an
important job.

751
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:23,172
people come to me to complain
and I tell them
where they can stick it.

752
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,407
Well, you should get a
job as Bigfoot!

753
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,643
I'll keep that in mind, kid.

754
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,111
Eat your asparagus, Luke.

755
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:31,780
No, No. That's a good idea.

756
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,849
Bigfoot doesn't really
have a job...

757
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,218
so I think I could handle it.

758
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:42,291
I mean, I sure wouldn't be late
to work, that's for sure.

759
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,627
Ha.

760
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:52,134
Let's get to the fun part
of the evening.

761
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,640
Well, Virginia...

762
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:59,708
It looks like Lizzy and Grant

763
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,710
are giving us a wine
tour of Tuscany.

764
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,846
Ahhhh, that sounds lovely.

765
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,714
Excellent choice, Lizzy

766
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,083
And as you all know,

767
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:11,587
Lizzy is the number-two
real estate agent
on the Gold Coast.

768
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,889
Seven thousand.

769
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:16,492
And let's just hope
next year, you are number-one.

770
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:18,928
For his birthday he likes to
show off his generosity.

771
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,096
- And a grandchild would be nice.
- It's weird.

772
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:23,265
Alright, Katie, what
have we got?

773
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,738
It's a custom-made shirt, Dad.
And the tie too.

774
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,607
- We know it's
your favorite color.

775
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,676
It's the same color
as your Mercedes, Bob.

776
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:35,711
Huh.

777
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,181
A thousand. You better put this
in the kid's college fund.

778
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:40,916
Thanks, Bob.

779
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,120
Sorry.

780
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,655
Zoe?

781
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,534
What the hell is it?

782
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,269
- It's a kaleidoscope.

783
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:02,338
- That looks like
very nice leather, Bob

784
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,774
What the hell am I supposed
to do with this?

785
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,111
Well, I know your job is
kinda stressful...

786
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,980
So I just figured that
with this,

787
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,982
you could take a moment
whenever you needed

788
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:14,116
just to look through it,

789
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:16,819
and look at the shapes,
and colors, and patterns.

790
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,454
It's super relaxing.

791
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:23,626
Zoe, do I look like
some burned out hippie to you?

792
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:27,496
- Now, Bob.
- No. Virginia,
I want her to answer this

793
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,499
and explain... this... and....

794
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:34,003
Look at you, the way you live...
who you live with.

795
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:37,840
She always does this.
Always makes everyone upset!

796
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,242
- What?
- We all try to understand you!

797
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,244
- Bullshit.
- What was that?

798
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,714
- I said bullshit.
- We don't appreciate-

799
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:49,018
Well I don't appreciate you
treating me like shit!

800
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,589
Okay, I get it. I'm not
part of your little family.

801
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,724
I mean that used to
make me feel bad,

802
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,493
but tonight,
after being here...

803
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,995
I am goddamn happy not to be
one of you people!

804
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,030
How dare you!

805
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,666
- Lizzy, you are such a bitch!
- Woah.

806
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,635
Do you want to know what
happened between me and
Gordy Menick?

807
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,037
I'll tell you what happened!

808
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:12,174
I caught Lizzie & Gordie boning
away in Bob & Virginia's bed!

809
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:14,977
Lizzie, how could you?
He had a limp!

810
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,179
Zoe stop it, we get your point.

811
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,014
Katie.

812
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:21,617
Don't you remember
when we were kids,

813
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,853
how you used to braid my hair
before we'd go to school?

814
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,857
Now you don't even tell me how
the kids are doing when I call.

815
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:32,061
- I want you out of here.
- Bob, you're just a total dick!

816
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,496
- May I add something, babe?

817
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,433
- Yeah go ahead,
dick sums it up for me.

818
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:41,837
These obnoxious shrews, and
their bitchy little husbands...

819
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,672
...not you Jonathan,
you're kinda cool...

820
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,275
are trying to buy your love.

821
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:48,577
Zoe would have
given it to you for free.

822
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,081
That's pathetic dude.

823
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:57,720
No... And if there's one
thing in this life...

824
00:55:57,722 --> 00:56:03,092
that I know intimately,
its pathetic.

825
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,195
...and you Bob...

826
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,831
you take the fucking cake.

827
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,268
Come on, babe.

828
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,111
Should I?

829
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,820
- Assholes.
- I don't ever
want to go back there.

830
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,256
You never, ever have to.

831
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:40,028
Ha ha, all time record low.
A hundred bucks.

832
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,865
Let's cash this before they
have a chance to stop payment.

833
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:35,911
Xanathine.
X-A-N-A-T-H-I-N-E. Xanathine.

834
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:45,153
Xanthoria. X-A-N-T-H-O-R-I-A.
Xanthoria.

835
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:47,222
What the hell are you doing?

836
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,727
I'm in training.
Hey, could you make more coffee?

837
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:53,996
- Hmmm, training for what?
- A Scrabble championship.

838
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:57,666
You know if you're finishing the
last of the coffee, it'd be
really nice if you'd make more.

839
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:02,938
That's impressive. Oh, can you
spell complete fucking
waste of time?

840
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,940
Too many letters. Ah, See.

841
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,077
Son of a bitch.

842
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:19,154
Zoe, I think what you're doing
is brave, crazy crazy brave...

843
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:21,623
and more than a little sexy.

844
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,927
I used to play a little
competitive air-guitar myself.

845
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:27,663
Weaaaah, B-na naa nau neoww...

846
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:29,531
Waaaah, wah, wah, wah...

847
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,466
Whammy bar. Waah wawahhh...

848
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:32,868
Taps!
Nana-l-na-l-na-l-na-lauw...

849
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,704
Bowwww... bowww...

850
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:38,607
You guys suspended
my driver's license

851
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:41,076
...for ticket I got
in Kentucky last Thanksgiving

852
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,579
that I've already paid.
I've already paid this.

853
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,485
Oh dude, come on!

854
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:54,523
- Well I'm good
at a lot of things.
- Yeah.

855
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:57,559
Excuse me Ken,
can I talk to you for a minute?

856
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,194
Yeah, who are you?

857
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,930
Wow! Jesus, Ken. That's quite a
bleach job you got going there.

858
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,099
Is that, uh, covered under
our dental plan?

859
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,868
No, I pay extra.
Who the hell are you?

860
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,637
Marty Huckhound.

861
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,706
Zoe's boyfriend.

862
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,541
The girl you like to
make fun of.

863
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,509
Oh, you're real, huh?

864
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,480
Yeah, I'm real, and I work in
the complaints department.

865
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:22,517
And this morning... Zoe had a
complaint of her own.

866
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,920
The coffee.

867
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,288
Yep, we- we- we have it.

868
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,190
You didn't make more.

869
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,792
Oh that, well...

870
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,427
Yeah well, you pissed her off.

871
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:37,933
Um, what exactly is your job
description here Ken?

872
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,068
I'm a systems analyst.

873
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,403
It's not asshole?

874
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:42,304
Excuse me?

875
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,172
Is that a very sought
after position?

876
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:47,142
Ha ha, what are you
talking- yes, yes it is.

877
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,878
Oh, so would it be a problem
if say...

878
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,847
you didn't show up
at work tomorrow?

879
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:55,951
Or would somebody else be happy
to step up
and fill in your shoes?

880
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:58,854
Look, weirdo-
- I'm not talking to you,
slut-face!

881
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:02,090
Hey hey hey, I don't want to
have to kick your ass.

882
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,392
And I don't want to have
to kick your ass!

883
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:06,194
Oh really? And what makes you
think that would happen?

884
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:10,399
'Cause I work out, and um,
you.. don't.

885
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:14,202
And I have a green belt
in Hopkido, and you...
clearly don't.

886
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,405
But you see,
what you don't understand

887
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:18,240
is that I have
anger and rage

888
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:21,810
...that's been brewing
in my ass for about
thirty-three years now.

889
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:25,213
So you make the call, Ken.
Do you want to risk it?

890
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,982
Because I'm not gonna get fired!

891
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:30,352
'Cause no one wants
my fucking job, Ken!

892
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,857
You're an asshole, Ken.

893
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,161
And I'm a crazy sonofabitch

894
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:42,464
who'll do anything in his power
to keep that woman...

895
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,067
...from being as
miserable as you and me.

896
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,302
Capisce?

897
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,137
Capisce.

898
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,780
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you o- I'm great.
Are you okay?

899
01:01:58,782 --> 01:01:59,981
I'm fine.

900
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,587
The last few days

901
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,889
have graced us
with some amazing words.

902
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,257
Here are some of the highlights,

903
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,359
some of the shorter
but sweeter words.

904
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,028
Qindars is one.

905
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,297
Of course starting with a Q,
that's a powerful word.

906
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:21,036
We've got Juju. That's simple,
but two very high scoring
letters in there.

907
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:24,573
Liri, Obia, Kudu.

908
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:28,977
Then we've got Tranq.
It's like Tranquilizer,
but without the uilizer.

909
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:32,380
Then we've got AAL. Now that's a
word that would have stumped me.

910
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,684
I'm quite amazed that no one
called objection to that.

911
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:39,321
It looks to me like an
abbreviation. Of course,
that's not allowed.

912
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,690
Looking to see if that's
an actual word.

913
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:44,025
Of course
the instincts tell us no,

914
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:47,195
...it doesn't look like one.
But... it turns out it is.

915
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,432
Had Johnson called the
objection, ah... it wouldn't
have helped him.

916
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,266
moving on...
- Nice.

917
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,734
...another great word, Puja.

918
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,069
- That's good, but what if
they did this?

919
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:55,737
Zebu, that's of course,
very high scoring.

920
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:59,708
We've got Fixt, with a T.
That's just a four letter word,
but it packs a punch.

921
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,109
Now talk about
packing a punch...

922
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,880
- Personal best!
- Yes!

923
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06,982
Zax. Simple. Powerful.

924
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:10,852
It's rare that someone has the
opportunity to play those two
letters at the same time.

925
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:12,120
Practice your two-letter words,

926
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,222
Because everyone goes for the
bingos, the seven letters.

927
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:17,192
Obviously that's great stuff,
but if you don't build, uh,
from the bottom up,

928
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:19,361
with, with your 2-letters
and your 3-letters,

929
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:25,000
...because the 2-letters, that's
where you play, you got your
parallel, parallel plays

930
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:28,136
and that's, that's the big money
right there, and that's how
I got here today.

931
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:32,474
I, I saw a lot of good plays out
there... but I, but I, I went
in here and I said,

932
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,442
'No one's gonna beat me at
the parallel plays.'

933
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,744
That's great advice, too-

934
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:41,950
Jim I understand that you've
never entered a formal Scrabble
tournament before. Is this true?

935
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,385
Uh, yes that is true.

936
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:46,688
So you're an impostor?
This is a game for you?

937
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:50,959
Huh? Never mind the 100's of
thousands of people who eat and
sleep and breath Scrabble

938
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,460
as a puzzle... to be solved!

939
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:53,995
I won fair and square.

940
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,132
Blasphemer! I call your bluff,
and I challenge him next year!

941
01:03:57,134 --> 01:04:01,002
: I am confident.
- I am confident.

942
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,672
: I have the heart
of a mighty warrior.

943
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,741
I have the heart of a
mighty warrior.

944
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,812
Four letter words with J
and K... Go now.

945
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:14,115
Jack, joke, jerk, juke,
other jouk, jock.

946
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,452
Penis.

947
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,322
They might try to throw you.

948
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,190
You gotta be ready.

949
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,495
Nice.

950
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:37,672
Zoe.

951
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,609
Got a new curse word for you...
Horshack.

952
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:42,143
It's a new sex move.

953
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:46,348
It's when you hum 'Welcome Back,
Kotter' while having oral-sex.

954
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,682
Take a note.

955
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,392
- Come on, Marty. Seven letters.
- Okay.

956
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,927
Count 'em up.

957
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:01,129
Quick, quick, quick.
You're falling behind. Come on.

958
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:08,069
Marty, come on.

959
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,473
I, I'm, I... I'm no good at
Scrabble, okay.

960
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:12,908
Ah... pcht.

961
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,979
- Marty.
- Zoe come on.

962
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,882
- Jake, you're up.
- Let's go.

963
01:05:20,884 --> 01:05:22,050
Focus.

964
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,053
- Okay...
- Yeah, he's just-

965
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,521
He's fine. You're fine.
Let's go.

966
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,428
She's good.

967
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:36,665
Yeah, she's good.

968
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,379
It's late, Mucky.

969
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:54,950
Are you okay?

970
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:59,354
Just can't sleep.

971
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,257
What are you doing up?

972
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,326
I wanted to clean the kitchen.

973
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:05,760
At one in the morning?

974
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,397
Don't you have words
to memorize?

975
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,436
I don't think there are
any more words.

976
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:24,346
Pills?

977
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,851
Where did you get those?

978
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,435
They were my backup plan.

979
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,240
Kind of a girlie-girl
way to go out, don't-

980
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:55,443
I was going to
wash them down with whiskey.

981
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,223
Still thinking about using them?

982
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,559
No.

983
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,896
I haven't even thought
about them

984
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,965
since that night
at my family's house.

985
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,834
That's funny.

986
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,973
I haven't thought about offing
myself since I met you.

987
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,412
Really?

988
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,984
Yeah.

989
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:46,421
The word weirdos are here.

990
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:47,922
- Is she freaking out?
- I don't know.

991
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,725
Oh, I'm a flipping mess!
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

992
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,727
Shirts!

993
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:54,929
- Come on, we gotta get moving.
- Okay, hang on a sec.

994
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:57,932
Marty, come on. Let's go...
Marty.

995
01:08:57,934 --> 01:09:01,669
Go on without me.
Lewis isn't here yet.

996
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:05,340
- Marty.
- Go.

997
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,216
Come on.

998
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,529
Dallas, Dayton,

999
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:30,331
Orlando
and now Chicago...

1000
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,800
for the 17th Annual

1001
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:35,503
National Scrabble
Championship Tournament.

1002
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,506
- I'm Parker Smith.
- Hi, and I'm Mitsy Dugan.

1003
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:41,910
It's such a pleasure to here
on a blustery Chicago day...

1004
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:45,146
as we kick off these
National Championships.

1005
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:46,814
It's been awhile since
its been in Chicago.

1006
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:49,417
We've had a couple rounds
in Dallas, and it looks like

1007
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,586
the committee has decided
that they need to

1008
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:54,189
shake things up a little bit,
and bring it to Chicago
this year.

1009
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:59,460
Okay, ladies and gent, in just 4
hours there will only be 8
contestants left on the stage.

1010
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:03,998
Our goal is to have at least
one of us left up there.

1011
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,435
: That's right and we
have contestants here
from all over the country.

1012
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:09,571
Ready to battle wits against
each other in the round robin.

1013
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:12,340
And somebody's going to go home
with a cash prize.

1014
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:14,309
Ok, it looks like the
contestants are coming out.

1015
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:15,877
There's a lot of
excitement in the air.

1016
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:19,547
And a lot of favorites.
Including a couple of
Chicago-born people.

1017
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,518
That's right Chicago, we've got
some hometown-heroes for
you to look after.

1018
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,720
Good luck. You'll need it.

1019
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,456
Right. You're one of those.

1020
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:32,627
Be sure to check out www.nsc.org
back-slash Chicago,
back-slash tiles

1021
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:36,664
We have our own Richard Johnson,
and he is live-tweeting
this entire event.

1022
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,866
So make sure you tune in,
tweetsters!

1023
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,802
The power of technology
ladies and gentlemen.

1024
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,804
Plaaaay Scrabble!

1025
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:46,441
- Okay, and it's game on.
- And our referee is looking
over everything.

1026
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:48,810
Oh well, this is of course
Jerry Turnbaeur.

1027
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:52,213
He will be looking at every
table with hawk-like precision.

1028
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,350
That's right, he knows the rules
and he's not afraid
to enforce them.

1029
01:10:55,352 --> 01:10:57,652
To look at the determination
of these people

1030
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:59,887
I mean for the
average Scrabble player...

1031
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:03,558
...this is mind-blowing.
- And it's just incredible
to think about...

1032
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,261
what goes through the minds
of these players.

1033
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,796
Several... several heavy-hitters
playing right now...

1034
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:12,233
along with a bunch of newcomers.
Curious what kind of game
they're bringing-

1035
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:14,235
The players are playing with
energy and intensity.

1036
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,204
Imagine what its like on that
floor right now.

1037
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:18,840
We had the word 'Taco' go
down over there.

1038
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,709
You can see the sweat coming off
the brow of these players.

1039
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:25,446
- That's a hook word.
- 65 point play right there.

1040
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,782
- We're gonna check that on our
virtual dictionary.
- Simple but elegant.

1041
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,550
See what Richards
got over there.

1042
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:33,488
Wonderful job of crafting which
word she's going to play
the next time.

1043
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,391
So she sets it up, all the
sudden there's a
third word there.

1044
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:38,159
- Pays it right off.
- It's amazing.

1045
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,361
And you can feel it
in this room.

1046
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:43,264
These players are serious
about their Scrabble game.

1047
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:46,634
Trying to get into the heads
of these contestants.

1048
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:50,271
It's very intense. They're not
only working their enormous
vocabularies...

1049
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:55,209
But they're also playing a good
bluffing game and there's a lot
of strategy involved.

1050
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:57,512
- Yep, thanks for the game.
- Nice Game.

1051
01:11:57,514 --> 01:12:00,782
- We have some matches ending.
- Rod MacNeil,
looks like he's lost.

1052
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:04,152
Losing out to Jim
Cramer was Scott Applestern.

1053
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:07,555
- ...David Wingard
and Bradley Witmarch-

1054
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:09,390
- Carl Johnson, eliminated.

1055
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:11,159
- Oh, that's gotta be
a disappointment.

1056
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,727
Sometimes
it's the luck of the draw.

1057
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:14,228
Well, with English
as your 2nd language...

1058
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,563
...you know.

1059
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:20,201
- Hmmm, not expecting that.
- That is a triple word score,

1060
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:22,770
and that's going to be 60 points
right in her pocket.

1061
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,540
And it should be noted that the
players get 3 games

1062
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,742
to try and make it
to the elimination round.

1063
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,745
That's right, everybody gets
plenty of opportunity.

1064
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,285
We're really seeing who
the shining stars are now,

1065
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:39,320
and it is intense in here.

1066
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:42,657
And it looks like round three,
with some very
interesting matches.

1067
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:45,893
That's right, some interesting
pairings. Look at this one
over here, Parker.

1068
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:49,897
- Oh of course, Dirk Franke and-
- Jacob Jarvi.

1069
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:52,734
- I've never seen anything
quite like it.
- Pla-a-ay Scrabble!

1070
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:54,802
- They could not look
more similar.

1071
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,371
- What are these two,
brothers?

1072
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:59,474
Ha ha, I'm thinking the same
baby-daddy, I don't
know about you.

1073
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:00,608
Good point.

1074
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,431
: Well, we just have a
few contestants left here in
this round robin.

1075
01:13:23,433 --> 01:13:27,835
After a few hours, we now see
the toughness
of these competitors.

1076
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:31,539
- And with a win, Zoe...
- I think it's Rezillo.

1077
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,674
Rezillo wins against
David Sniffel

1078
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:36,778
Left on the floor are Dirk
Franke and Jacob Jarvi.

1079
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,813
It makes sense that they would
stick it out for the long haul.

1080
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,849
We have a nail-biter
match going on here.

1081
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:45,787
It looks like they were cut from
the same cloth, but their styles
are completely different.

1082
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:49,290
100 percent. Jacob plays a
kinder gentler Scrabble...

1083
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:52,727
and Dirk is not gonna let him
get away with it this time.

1084
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:54,929
Well he is a machine...

1085
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,464
with a heart of gold, I imagine.

1086
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:59,567
Jacob is going to need to step
it up and get a little
more aggressive

1087
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:01,569
...if he wants to take this
away from Dirk.

1088
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:03,304
Boom, that's it!
- But you can see clearly...

1089
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,273
...Dirk is the master.
- Thatta girl!

1090
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,175
- Did not say please, or nothing.
- Have a good one.

1091
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:08,376
Another win for Dirk.

1092
01:14:08,378 --> 01:14:10,812
- Wow. Wow.
- He does it with flare.

1093
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:13,714
Literally. Putting flare down
was a smart move!

1094
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:17,418
That's right. It's sad to see
this elimination happen,

1095
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,155
but Dirk Franke is going to move
into our elimination round.

1096
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:24,158
Congratulations to the survivors

1097
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,160
who now move on
to the single-elimination

1098
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,895
Scrabble Off!

1099
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:32,467
Feel free to stretch your legs
and return to your tables
in ten minutes.

1100
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,869
Play will resume in fifteen.

1101
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:36,504
Nice start Zoe, fifth place!

1102
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:38,639
Yeah, that's the 2nd best female
start in history.

1103
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:43,544
- Thanks. Marty's not here.
- Oh, Chicago traffic sucks.

1104
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,847
Three matches to the finals.
He'll be here by the end.

1105
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:47,348
You must be Zoe.

1106
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,718
- That's my name.
- Don't wear it out, biotch!

1107
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:56,791
You do realize only one girl
has ever won this illustrious
competition, yes?

1108
01:14:56,793 --> 01:15:01,262
- Rita Norr, Las Vegas, 1987
- And she is goddess, not a girl.

1109
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:03,264
Yeah, goddess. What are you,
little boy?

1110
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:07,568
Uh, as if you didn't know.
I'm Dirk Franke.

1111
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:12,039
And I'm gonna paddle your perky
little ass with my vastly
superior mastery

1112
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,242
of all things Funk & Wagnalls.

1113
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:16,611
You know what I think, Frank?

1114
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:19,947
Oh, oh please tell me.
Tell me right now.

1115
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:23,117
I think Zoe's going to hand you
the worst loss of your life.

1116
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,987
Hmmm. Well, do you know
what I think?

1117
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:30,258
I think between this phallic
symbol you keep staring at...

1118
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,994
the metaphorical ass-paddling
I'm about to give you...

1119
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:38,666
and the raw sexual tension that
is Scrabble Tournament play...

1120
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:43,204
I am very, very turned
on right now.

1121
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,283
Okay,

1122
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:59,220
I'll see you at the tables then.
I have a little old
lady to beat.

1123
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:04,325
Oops! Sorry Ethel. I did not
see you standing... right there.

1124
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:11,699
Did that really just happen?

1125
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,267
- Welcome back
to the elimination round.
- Welcome back.

1126
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:16,003
Ignore him. He's gotta get
through me first.

1127
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:18,105
And now we're looking at
our top sixteen.

1128
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:22,143
People have just dropped off
like flies. We had some
amazing contenders.

1129
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:25,546
It's sad, but exciting for so
many others who have
advanced on.

1130
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:28,783
A surprise step for Zoe Rezillo.

1131
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:31,218
That's the name, I think
it's Zoe Rezillo.

1132
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,120
- No ranking whatsoever
in Scrabble

1133
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:34,255
- We do not see this
very often.

1134
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:37,825
For a complete unknown to have
leapt into the elimination round

1135
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:40,595
is very, very impressive.

1136
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,908
And it looks like Dirk Franke
is doing his usual.

1137
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,910
- Wow, he's getting up
into the 300's.

1138
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,979
Well, that's why he's
always second best.

1139
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:01,382
He is an incredible player.
It'd be nice to see him
finally get a win.

1140
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:05,286
Ooh, I think that was the game
right there for Zoe Rezillo
there wasn't it?

1141
01:17:07,557 --> 01:17:12,827
And it looks of course like Dirk
Franke has beaten his opponent
in the elimination round.

1142
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:20,234
You're watching masters do their
craft on the board.

1143
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:23,904
- That's right. That's right.
- You definitely see the
determination of the-

1144
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:26,607
Oh and you can see some anger
right there with, uh,
Mike Theobold...

1145
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:28,709
I think that was, from Tucson.

1146
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:31,212
It would be different if this
was not the first time that
he'd done that.

1147
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:34,148
But that was a nice win for
Zoe Rezillo there, wasn't it?

1148
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,276
It looks like we're into
the semifinal round now.

1149
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,178
Not a surprise,
Dirk Franke winning.

1150
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,281
Dirk Franke wins it. We're going
to be seeing him in the finals.

1151
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:11,252
Wow, we are down
to the wire here.

1152
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:13,921
Escaping from that last round
is Zoe Rezillo.

1153
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:16,857
She is matched up there with-
- That is Scott Pate.

1154
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,894
If you're just now catching us,
these two are going at it,

1155
01:18:19,896 --> 01:18:21,929
and have been for
quite some time.

1156
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,699
- Oh, beautiful move!
- It looks like she's done it.

1157
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:27,334
This knocks her ahead of Scott.
I cannot believe this.

1158
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:31,706
She has just smacked down a
seasoned player and put herself
right into the final.

1159
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,808
Head to head with Dirk Franke.

1160
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:38,312
Mr. Number Two is going to meet
a nobody in the finals.

1161
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:39,447
Where the hell's Marty?

1162
01:18:39,449 --> 01:18:41,449
: Two locals
in the finals?

1163
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:43,751
- Lewis, he said
he was bringing you.
- I took the bus.

1164
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:44,885
: Have you seen
this happen before?

1165
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,121
What an unbelievable
moment for Chicago.

1166
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:48,556
- You need to chill
out for the final.

1167
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,658
No, what I need is
for my boyfriend-

1168
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,293
- Oh my God, what's that?
- What?

1169
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:56,163
Well yeah, they need to film
the finals to show
up on the screens.

1170
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,565
That way the
audience can see it.

1171
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,668
That and they show highlights on
ESPN 5, local news and stuff.

1172
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:03,571
How do you think they make the
tapes that you've been
studying for years?

1173
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:10,044
Well whoever wins, Chicago is
definitely going to be proud of
this mental might.

1174
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:11,979
It finally puts us on the map.

1175
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:14,582
Excuse me, Zoe Rezillo?
Mitch Conley, ESPN 5.

1176
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:16,283
Uh, this is Zoe. Excuse me.

1177
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:18,486
Hi Zoe, how does it feel to be
playing last year's runner up?

1178
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:22,089
: Welcome back, we've
made it through round robin,
into the elimination round

1179
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,658
...and all the way
to the finals.

1180
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:29,396
We have somebody exciting to
introduce to you - somebody
you might recognize.

1181
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:33,167
He's a champion from 2010.
It's Bill Williams.

1182
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:35,369
- Hello.
- Hi Bill, great to have you
here with us.

1183
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:38,773
- Thank you, I'm glad to be here.
- Tell us what you think about
this final match.

1184
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:42,443
Well, it's bringing
back memories.
I know what it's like.

1185
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,712
I know what it's like to be
there for the first time.

1186
01:19:44,714 --> 01:19:47,715
And the nerves,
the frayed nerves.

1187
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:49,183
What she's going through,
it's exciting.

1188
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:52,787
: The one thing she's got
going for her is history.

1189
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,789
I have gum.

1190
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,297
You're mad.

1191
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:05,566
Yes, I'm mad.

1192
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:14,575
I'm out there,
kicking so much ass.

1193
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:17,545
And you, where have you been?

1194
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:19,513
Why weren't you here?

1195
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,683
You don't need me.

1196
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,018
What?

1197
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,422
You don't need me.

1198
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:37,498
You think I'm with you
because I need you?

1199
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:40,534
I'm with you because I love you.

1200
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,237
Not because I need you.

1201
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,609
I love you more than
anything in this world.

1202
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,645
I love you.

1203
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,582
...and need you.

1204
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:58,819
Is that okay?

1205
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:02,056
I'm right here, Mucky.

1206
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,262
Are you going to tell me
where you were?

1207
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,798
Not right now.

1208
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:15,236
Later... maybe.

1209
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:19,707
- You have something
in your hair.
- It's bird shit.

1210
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:23,010
--I'm covered in it.

1211
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,919
You're wearing one too.

1212
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,423
Who do you think came up
with the idea?

1213
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,597
Are you ready to go
kick some ass?

1214
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,602
There are cameras out there.

1215
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:53,841
Two of them... ESPN 5.

1216
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:58,479
Baby, you need to
listen to me...

1217
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:03,651
Nobody on this planet
watches ESPN 5.

1218
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:05,419
Really?

1219
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,754
Really.

1220
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,195
Well, I guess I better go
kick some ass.

1221
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:35,783
: What would you suggest
Zoe do going into this match?

1222
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:39,153
Uh, she has to keep Dirk out of
her head, number one priority.

1223
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:44,358
He is... and I can say this from
first-hand experience. He's a
master of the mind game.

1224
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,328
He gets in there and messes
around, you know
what I'm saying?

1225
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:51,465
He digs, like with a couple of
chopsticks, right, right
underneath the eyeball...

1226
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,435
- into the cerebral cortex.
- Cortex, very good word.

1227
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:57,705
You jiggle that a little bit,
and that's about what it feels
like to play Dirk Franke.

1228
01:22:57,707 --> 01:23:00,507
- Each will draw one tile.
- You have to shut off.
You have to be able to

1229
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:03,577
turn a switch to just focus on
the words, the letters.

1230
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,846
I've seen it
in the previous matches.

1231
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:08,015
I've been here watching,
and she's got talent.

1232
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:10,351
I don't know who she is, I don't
know where she came from,

1233
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:11,719
but she can do it...

1234
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:15,222
- Dirk will play first!
- if she stays in her own
mental space.

1235
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:16,557
- Zoe second.
- Dammit.

1236
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:18,759
Fifty seven percent of the time,
the person who goes first wins.

1237
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,694
- Sorry
- And...

1238
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,663
PLA-A-AY SCRABBLE!

1239
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:27,401
: And it looks like we're
going into the match now with
Dirk going first,

1240
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:29,169
starting with EURO.

1241
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:33,073
Just recently becoming a word
with Merriam Webster's within
the past ten years.

1242
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:36,577
- Oh and it looks like Zoe
lays down PISMIRE.
- Yes!

1243
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:38,746
She gets points for both her
word and the enemy's first word!

1244
01:23:38,748 --> 01:23:41,615
- Enemy?
- The person in the other chair,
Lewis.

1245
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:43,584
She is off to the races,
that's a fifty point bonus.

1246
01:23:43,586 --> 01:23:45,586
A bingo out of the gate,
that's a gift.

1247
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:48,756
It's also a subtle insult being
that pismire means piss-ant.

1248
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:51,725
Such a strong start for Zoe,
a weak start for Dirk.

1249
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:54,028
That's the luck of the draw
though. That's how this
game is played.

1250
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:58,732
- Okay, Zoe comes in
with the word VENEER.
- That dreaded V-word.

1251
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,301
Followed up by Dirk's FATTY.
Ha ha ha.

1252
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:03,170
Sometimes a word'll
just crack you up.

1253
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:05,572
And you have to wonder if
they're sending messages
to each other.

1254
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:06,974
I just don't think it's nice.

1255
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:09,376
I'll tell you one thing though
those two are not laughing.

1256
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,111
Let's see what she does
with this next play

1257
01:24:11,113 --> 01:24:12,379
The game is tied right now.

1258
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,349
This could be a turning point.
- Dirk has tied it up.

1259
01:24:15,351 --> 01:24:17,251
A straight up point
for point tie. Incredible.

1260
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:19,053
122 points to 122 points.

1261
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,455
- Oh wow!
- Look at what she did there.

1262
01:24:21,457 --> 01:24:22,790
- Yes!
- A parallel play!

1263
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:24,124
That is a play
that I can respect.

1264
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:25,692
- That's good, right?
- It's all about
the parallel plays.

1265
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:29,129
So would you say this is typical
for a new player?

1266
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:31,565
I'm going to stop you
right there, Phillip.
Look at that word.

1267
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:35,302
- Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.
- Oh wow! EXONERATE.

1268
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:38,672
Playing off the existing word
ER, I mean you couldn't
have seen it coming.

1269
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:41,742
- Dirk just got himself a bingo.
- That was 84 points.

1270
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,677
He's turned it around,
he's come back.

1271
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,013
I mean the momentum,
after that first play...

1272
01:24:46,015 --> 01:24:48,082
from Dirk, has been
pretty enormous.

1273
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:51,552
And Zoe's either going to pull
out here or fall behind.

1274
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:53,487
What is the strategy when we
get to this point?

1275
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:54,755
These players,
they're good enough,

1276
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:57,024
they know what the other player
has on their racks.

1277
01:24:57,026 --> 01:24:58,992
There's a couple of big letters
left out there.

1278
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:00,060
I mean every move
really counts right now.

1279
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:01,361
There's a J and there's a Z.

1280
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:03,197
If you're not looking
at one of those right now...

1281
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,465
...you're freaking out.

1282
01:25:04,467 --> 01:25:06,967
We're going to need to see
Zoe step up her game.

1283
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:08,769
If we pay attention
to the clocks here,

1284
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,738
we'll see that Dirk
has more time left than Zoe...

1285
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:15,476
and that always plays
psychologically into the
players' minds.

1286
01:25:15,478 --> 01:25:17,211
It's such a fight for her
right now.

1287
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,412
It's remained
neck and neck.

1288
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:20,747
Well, he seems to be maybe
saving tiles

1289
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:26,120
Or this is one of the best
defensively played
championships I have seen.

1290
01:25:26,122 --> 01:25:28,055
These players are being
blocked left and right.

1291
01:25:28,057 --> 01:25:30,124
I just feel like they're both
holding onto something,

1292
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:32,192
and we're going to see how
this plays out.

1293
01:25:32,194 --> 01:25:34,194
You can hear a pin drop
down on that stage.

1294
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:37,131
- She only has four tiles.
- It's over when you run out
of tiles.

1295
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,266
There's still a Z out there.
It's worth 10 points.

1296
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:43,103
The look on Dirk's face
says he has won it.

1297
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:45,772
- It's not fun to be 3 feet away
from that face.

1298
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:49,810
And Dirk plays what will be one
of the last plays of the game,

1299
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:51,478
if not the last, uh...

1300
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,580
- Bras. -Bras?

1301
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:56,016
- That's a surprise.
- I think he's playing defense.

1302
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:58,418
He's playing big time defense on
that triple word score.

1303
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,688
- Would you have done the same
thing in his position?
- Uh, its hard to tell.

1304
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,691
You don't know the man's rack.
In fact, there's two letters
left on that rack,

1305
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:08,328
if one of them's a Z,
Zoe is out of luck.

1306
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,430
But even with the Z,
at this point

1307
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,332
there's not much room
to play it.

1308
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:15,169
274 to 304.

1309
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,171
Not looking good
in these final moments

1310
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:18,605
for newcomer Zoe Rezillo.

1311
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:20,073
Deep in thought, she is.

1312
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:23,010
She fought hard. She's played a
tough game, and it was amazing

1313
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:25,179
that she was in this
final round.

1314
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:30,217
Yeah, looks like she's making a
play, and it looks like she
going to play off the bras.

1315
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:33,420
ZEBRASS for triple word
score and 54 points.

1316
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:35,322
- Zebrass?
- She used an extra S.

1317
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:36,590
- Now is that a word?
- That's not a word.

1318
01:26:36,592 --> 01:26:38,458
- What if it is a word?
- Yeah, look it up.

1319
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,394
That would not be the plural
of Zebras, would it?

1320
01:26:40,396 --> 01:26:43,163
- Now it has been challenged.
- I challenge...

1321
01:26:43,165 --> 01:26:45,232
that Zebra-s-s is not
a real word.

1322
01:26:45,234 --> 01:26:46,533
- What's going on?
- It seems dirty, but it's smart.

1323
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,035
He's doing what he had to do.

1324
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,803
Well, if the enemy's right
and its not a real word,

1325
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:52,706
she loses her turn, and the
enemy wins the game.

1326
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:56,109
- No man is an enemy
in God's eyes.
- Clam it, Lewis.

1327
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:58,378
The dictionary determines the
game from this point.

1328
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,447
Wow, this is an
incredible finish!

1329
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:02,716
- ZEBRASS.
- Game over!

1330
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:05,285
The offspring of a
Zebra and an Ass.

1331
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:07,554
- It is a word.
- Challenge is denied!

1332
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,790
- Wow!
- Miss Rezillo wins!

1333
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:13,193
Incredible!
Zoe Rezillo takes it for the win!

1334
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:16,496
She's done it,
from out of nowhere!

1335
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:19,600
This is amazing to watch,
and look at these fans,
they're eating it up!

1336
01:27:19,602 --> 01:27:23,503
This is a rags-to-riches
cinderella-story that
we're watching.

1337
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:27,541
An enviable run from what we all
thought was a, a lay person!

1338
01:27:27,543 --> 01:27:30,510
- Dreams can come true.
- They do, they do, everyday...

1339
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:32,346
and I can tell you, I know
what she's going through,

1340
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:33,647
and she feels good right now!

1341
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:35,382
And that's what this sport
is all about.

1342
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:37,751
Stories like that,
like what happened today.

1343
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:41,255
What an exciting finish.
That girl is smart.

1344
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,068
Okay, all right,

1345
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:57,471
So we're definitely in a mall...

1346
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,640
And I think, I think I'm getting
this.

1347
01:27:59,642 --> 01:28:00,974
I totally know
where we're at now.

1348
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:02,509
- Okay, watch your step.

1349
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:04,344
I smell the food court...

1350
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:07,180
We stopped walking.
Can I take this off now?

1351
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:08,815
Here let me do it.

1352
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:22,462
Someone has been
very irresponsible

1353
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,131
with her Scrabble winnings.

1354
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:26,433
I don't have to worry
about money.

1355
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,702
I get a hundred bucks a year
from my step-dad.

1356
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,809
You made a cloud.

1357
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,647
And its a heart.

1358
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:44,551
And I can see it.

1359
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,989
Thank you.
