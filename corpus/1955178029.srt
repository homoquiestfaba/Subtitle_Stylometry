What do you mean?

I have a great idea.
Let's go to Turkey.

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,480
Only
the other side of the border.

6
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,700
Yeah, let's do it.

7
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I do not think that's a good idea.
- Do not you have fun?

8
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,240
OK, I will.

9
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,800
My parents would die if they knew I was going
in Turkey.

Saladin Bey told me to undress.

Why is this?

50
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,960
You can hide drugs.
I have to search it thoroughly.

51
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,600
I want to call the embassy.
- Located in Istanbul.

52
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,120
I want to contact them.

53
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,200
We are American citizens.
We have rights.

54
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,160
From now on you have only those rights
that I give you. You have to search you.

55
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,560
If you touch it with your finger...

56
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,040
Wait!

57
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,940
Better do what he says
.

58
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,280
Stand in line, please.

59
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,480
Off your clothes.

60
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,520
Bra too.

61
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,360
Immediately remove any clothing.

62
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,061
Undress!

63
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,560
Can I help?

64
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,760
Now check
hiding something, which is not visible.

65
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,840
What was that?

66
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,880
Failed  excursion.
- I did not want to go with you.

67
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,560
Now we are not listening to Bonnie.

68
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,840
Calm. I'll think of something.

69
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,240
You can sit there.

70
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,720
Hi, I'm - May.
Beds are available.

71
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,920
Lie  there?

72
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,640
I - Colleen, and that her Audrey Michelle.
- Hi.

73
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,480
This is my pet.

74
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,480
Full of lice. And you will be the same after
days.

75
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,520
Spent many wet winters.

76
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,480
What is this?
- Turn off the lights at 22:00.

77
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,600
I can not believe it.

78
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,600
Did you sleep well?
- Ate me alive.

79
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Why have you left the earrings?

80
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,800
I do not know.
Maybe because they are small.

81
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,120
Why keep us here?
I want to go home.

82
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,560
Nobody knows where we are.
- Leave tales. Will not help.

83
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,160
See how hungry look.
- What kind of nonsense?

84
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,640
I wish one of us.

85
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,480
Demonstration is over, come on.

86
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,040
Where were you?
- Late.

87
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,160
I hope Pakiz still
will give us milk.

88
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Pakiz exception
just because your first day here.

89
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,920
No longer be late.

90
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,000
This is a powder. If you want real,
whisper in my ear.

91
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,680
What did he mean?

92
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,400
If you want something to be delivered,
cigarettes, coffee, drugs, or soap...

93
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,800
... Turn to Pakiz.
Just ready money.

94
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,560
It - God Is, or what?
- Prisoner sentenced to life.

95
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,760
Sale lot.
- They permit this...?!

96
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,600
Saladin.
It gets most of the profits.

97
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,360
Did it something like a mini boss.
No trust her.

98
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,040
I have to do something.

99
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,560
I think our friend from the bathroom
has already made his choice.

100
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,120
Awesome. But not enough.

101
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,240
Coming.

102
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,360
Do you want coffee?

103
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,680
What is your problem?

104
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,040
I'll kill you!

105
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,080
Uber them.

106
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,800
Who is in charge here?
- You.

107
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,840
Do not forget.

108
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,840
You... then in my office.

109
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,041
All. Spread out.

110
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,360
Will be even more if
brightened Sheikh.

111
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,920
It's okay.
Personally checked them.

112
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:30,560
All  aware.
Almost ready.

113
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,440
We should be careful, make sure
no one knows where they are.

114
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,520
Trust me.

115
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,440
You, you tell her you.

116
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,480
Follow me.

117
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,800
No! No!

118
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,000
Let me out!

119
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,160
Yes.

120
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,040
Come on, come on.

121
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,280
Seat. Is everything okay?
- Yes.

122
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,800
Do you like my bag?
- Very nice.

123
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,160
Skin is soft as a woman's breast.
Feel January

124
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,680
Miss Dorothy, drug smuggling -
is a very serious accusation.

125
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,640
Did not know
that car was drugs.

126
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,000
This court will decide.
This will be fair.

127
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,480
And when?

128
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,280
I do not know.
Court crowded.

129
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,080
Can I call you?
Nobody knows we're here.

130
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,800
You can write letters.
Pakiz will send them.

131
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,840
What about the lawyer?
- When the time comes.

132
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,000
And you call this justice?
- Do not try my patience.

133
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,320
Really? When it's my time?

134
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,360
You can return
with friends.

135
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,640
Miss Dorothy?

136
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,560
Your friend  considered a guide.
Keep them in the right direction.

137
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,600
Otherwise,
'll deal with you. Is that clear?

138
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,760
And remember, Miss Dorothy,
that my door is always open for you.

139
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:06,261
Move!

140
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:19,800
Thank you. Until recently.
- Next time will be better.

141
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,840
Follow them.

142
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,920
Can we call someone?
- No. We can write letters.

143
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,880
Letters? I think I'll stay
for a very long time here.

144
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,400
This is not so bad.
- What else but write.

145
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,880
We can not even call
the American Embassy.

146
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,440
Michelle is right.
It is important to think positively.

147
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,041
Right?
- Exactly.

148
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,442
Right?
- Yes, of course.

149
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Let's write everything we know.
- And what will pay for postage?

150
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,260
They took all my money.
- Wait a minute.

151
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,200
What is she doing there?
- I'll find out.

152
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,240
I think you'll get
few stamps.

153
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:42,341
Enter.

154
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,120
How many letters.
- These are the cards.

155
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,680
For our friends who saw
what a beautiful place we live.

156
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,760
Joker.
- Simply send Pakiz.

157
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,280
Let Sultan got my little daughter,
if not let them in the afternoon.

158
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,040
Let your husband ran off with another woman,
if not send them in the afternoon.

159
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,000
He already escaped.
- Who would have doubted.

160
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,640
Here it is!
- Catch it!

161
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,520
Many are quick!

162
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,040
May, let me help you.

163
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,080
No, thank you.
- But you do not feel good.

164
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,680
As it is, without need to wash my
.

165
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,920
Are you sure?
- Yes.

166
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,560
I'll go with you.
- It's all right. Bonnie Michelle her there.

167
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,960
This soap smells.

168
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,840
Once was white.
- What is "white"?

169
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,960
Like the color of your ass.

170
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,920
What do you want?
- Bonnie knows what.

171
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:57,800
We can make it mild or harsh.
I think you have to be rude.

172
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,400
What are you doing?

173
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,301
Away!

174
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,400
She started!
- She tried to rape her!

175
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,960
I am not guilty.
- Shut up!

176
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,800
Who is in charge here,
Miss Burns?

177
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,960
Who is the principal?

178
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,720
Stop!
For you there God?

179
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,840
Here I am God.

180
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,120
In isolation.
- What? Let me out!

181
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,240
Colleen...
- Where are you taking me?

182
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,960
Okay?

183
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,720

There are many worm.

184
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,120
No, thank you.

185
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,640
Are you sure
that said "insulator"?

186
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,080
May, what is it?
- Cell horror.

187
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:06,080
My fault.
- Bonnie, no one will fault, shut up.

188
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,720
Okay?
- It's just a cough.

189
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,640
'll Hurt for a while.
- A little.

190
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:25,720
How can we help Colleen?
- Not at all, we can only wait.

191
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,720
Pigs.
- Hey, you!

192
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
I?

193
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,520
You... come with me.

194
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,960
Now!

195
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,520
Bonnie !
- Keep working.

196
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,000
Come here.

197
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,320
Seat.

198
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,440
Are you afraid of me?

199
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,520
No sense.
I want to be your friend.

200
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:55,720
You have a very innocent face. And it
a problem in a place like this.

201
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,280
I do not know.

202
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,680
You, of course, regret
that make trouble.

203
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,200
Colleen tells me not to worry about it.

204
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,960
Yes, because of you, she died in solitary.

205
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,320
Must be kidding.

206
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,400
However...

207
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,280
... I can release tomorrow
if...

208
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,120
Do not worry,
I keep my promises.

209
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,600
Let me out!

210
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,000
Do not you want to call someone?
- We just wrote letters.

211
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,400
Throw them in the trash.
- I do not understand?

212
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,800
Now listen to me carefully.

213
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,560
Taken me a year ago
the same border as you.

214
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,400
Since then here?
- I've been here a month.

215
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,320
Saladin  sell me the trader who holds
brothel.

216
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,400
This is the brand of Saladin.
And you will do the same.

217
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,560
What?

218
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,680
At 30 am
and I look 60.

219
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,400
'll Fuck in all holes.

220
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,680
After months will be filled with
diseases.

221
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,920
If after six months you die,
will kill you, it will find new.

222
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,640
Lord. What to do?
- Escape.

223
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,040
Can kill you, but it's better than
to stay here.

224
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,360
Someone is coming.

225
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,480
Remember what I told you.
- Sure.

226
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:24,360
Susan. My name is Susan Allen.

227
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,440
I just want to remember me.
- I will not forget.

228
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,480
How nice to see you!

229
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,840
What was there?

230
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,440
I was with a woman who told me
...

231
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,480
... get away from here
as soon as possible.

232
00:37:54,679 --> 00:38:00,360
Colleen  I want to go home.
Seems that it is so far.

233
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,320
What happened to you?
- Nothing.

234
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,240
Tell me.

235
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,920
Where are you going?
- With the new girlfriend.

236
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,760
How touching.
- Leave us alone!

237
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,480
And you better sleep with your eyes open
.

238
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,200
No need.
I feel you stink.

239
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm tired of harassing us!

240
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,960
When you know a knife that she threw away?
- Yes.

241
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,360
Let's see how good it is.

242
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,280
Where are you going?
- To see Elena.

243
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,720
Ask her what she wants.
- What do you want?

244
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,920
A personal matter.
- More personal.

245
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,400
You have two minutes.
- Is it private?

246
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,880
Well?
- Stay away from my friends.

247
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,080
And  came here to tell me this?
- Protect your interests.

248
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,280
What do you mean by that?
- I have relations to Bonnie.

249
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,200
General.
- You mean...

250
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,200
I'd rather show you.
- What do you Think?

251
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,320
Once you taking a shower at night?
- This would be convincing.

252
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,560
Hot water her slippery foam.

253
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,760
I'll be in the bathroom at midnight.

254
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,280
My fault.
- Lord, Bonnie, stop.

255
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,400
True.
- Elena will bother us.

256
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,380
I can not bear it.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

257
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,060
You've always had bad Audrey.
- It's a gift.

258
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,320
If you think  bad,
it happens. You're ready.

259
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,440
What do you think?
- I have to work.

260
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,560
So, you decided to join?
- Yes. Give me the soap.

261
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,960
Nice.

262
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,200
Wait. Now it's my turn.

263
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,680
Very sharp,
and I am very nervous.

264
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,680
Do not pull her not yell.

265
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,760
Do you understand?
- Yes.

266
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,320
I'll ask a few questions.

267
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,240
Nodded "Yes" or
back to "No".

268
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,120
If you start shaking your head a lot,
then she'll slit your throat.

269
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,680
Do you understand?
- Yes.

270
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,680
Thou her your girlfriend lesbian
will leave us alone. Right?

271
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,360
And  no longer worry
none of us. Right?

272
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:33,160
Doing
will gut you.

273
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,840
Do you understand?
- Yes.

274
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,880
When he touched me, I felt like
vomit.

275
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,760
I want to
feel the same way.

276
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,040
Eat it  so
if it was chocolate.

277
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,360
Eat! Suck!

278
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:56,160
Can I help?

279
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,800
Now clean it from inside.

280
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:33,600
May, you better're familiar with these
who sell them in the brothel.

281
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,800
Hey, Pakiz why Elena
did not come to breakfast?

282
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,280
Usually fails.

283
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,720
She said her stomach hurt.

284
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,840
I heard that it moves away from the toilet.
- Really? - Yes.

285
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,560
Tell me about this merchant, May.

286
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,440
What do others say?
- They do not know anything.

287
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,600
I do not know.
- Really?

288
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,760
Or are you afraid to talk?

289
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,160
Where are you going, Bonnie?
- In the bathroom.

290
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:35,840
I'm coming with you.
- No. Stay here, please.

291
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,400
Miss Child?

292
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,760
I'm glad you came.

293
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,400
Unbuttoned shirt.
- No.

294
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,200
Please. I do not want.

295
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,600
Take off, please.
- No.

296
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,440
Unbuttoned shirt.

297
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:31,640
Strip.

298
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,320
Slow.
Do it slowly.

299
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:00,280
Sit, May.
Pakiz!

300
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,680
Do not worry. Pretends
to be absent from work.

301
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,200
Pretending you?
Gotta get her to the infirmary.

302
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,040
No need.
I just want to lay down.

303
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:22,320
Marcy, take January
- OK.

304
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,280
Give me your hand.

305
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,280
Ready ? One, two, three! Case.
Easy.

306
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:39,280
Do not worry about it.
I will not die from this.

307
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,880
Can not bathe now.
- My friend is inside.

308
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,440
'll Bathe later.

309
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,120
Very soon, you will be justified.

310
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,400
Bonnie  specialties of Saladin.

311
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,640
What do you mean, Pakiz?
- Do not you know?

312
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,960
Well blather. Right?
- You.

313
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,520
Girlfriend fuck with him.
- What?

314
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:58,280
Why do you think they release from solitary
?

315
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,800
What? Get out!
- You've got a lot of work!

316
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,440
Everything will be fine.

317
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,520
Tried to commit suicide.
If I had not gone...

318
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,480
okay, honey?

319
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,600
There are no grounds for December
commit suicide.

320
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,720
Do you need help?
- Alone we can do.

321
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,640
Son of a bitch.

322
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:54,341
Come on, Bonnie.

323
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,480
If you do not run in the near future,
Bonnie die.

324
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:04,880
If your cellmate was right,
then us will be the same.

325
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:09,520
Gotta get out of here.
- Yes, but how?

326
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:13,520
I think I may die.

327
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,720
I want to talk to Colleen.
- I will come.

328
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:31,320
We'll take you to the infirmary.
- No. I prefer to die here.

329
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,880
This is the key to the cell.
I keep it for many years.

330
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,920
Dreaming of escape,
but it was just a dream.

331
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,400
Take advantage .
Take the girls here.

332
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,040
I want to rest.

333
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,120
Fighting for his life
to die in prison.

334
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,480
She was not alone.
We were with her.

335
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:48,240
Bonnie, what is it?

336
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,240
I wanted to go for her.

337
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,200
Do not say that.

338
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,360
Need to get into his office.

339
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,680
How do you do it?

340
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,440
Invent something.

341
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,280
Leaving. Will meet with the mediator.
- OK.

342
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,760
Did it?
- Enough to tie this beast.

343
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,280
I hope that tomorrow will be
in Thessaloniki.

344
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,340
I think it will work.
- I'll find out.

345
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,641
I'm ready.
- Go.

346
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:00,920
Where are you going?
- We want to leave them in place.

347
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,880
Old vomited on the floor,
and must be cleaned.

348
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,000
Look who's here.
Come on, honey.

349
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,120
Want?
- Yes.

350
00:57:20,721 --> 00:57:21,721
Come to us.

351
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,720
You're such a big boy.
- I - a little child.

352
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,640
Car keys!

353
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:45,640
Child wants milk.
- Well, my mom would give milk.

354
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,200
What are you doing. Silly boy.
I have to tie.

355
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,720
Spank him good.
Naughty boy.

356
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,440
Should go.
- Wait. To play more.

357
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:24,560
What your man! Maybe tomorrow.
- Will do as you say. Bye.

358
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:33,360
Guards at the gate of her parking
can bribe.

359
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:36,360
But car keys
in office Saladin.

360
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,840
Our personal matters too.
Can reveal the truth about this place.

361
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:44,760
Too dangerous to go there.
- I've already been.

362
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,920
You will not enter. He'll let me.
- What?

363
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:53,760
I'm going with him.

364
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,200
While he fucks me,
you will attack.

365
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,160
Lord, Bonnie...
- We have no choice.

366
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:30,560
Colleen.
- How did it go?

367
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,640
Mediator told me that now wants
$ 100 200 it when out.

368
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,320
We do not have any money.
I have only $ 10.

369
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:42,720
What do we do?
- I'll find the money.

370
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,160
How?
- From our friend Pakiz.

371
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:07,840
So what happened?
- I'll be waiting for me at 14:30.

372
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:10,720
So far so good.

373
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:19,400
Give me the knife her napkin.

374
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:27,000
I'll find the money.

375
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,480
What are you doing, Colleen?
- Monthly.

376
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:36,400
Call security.

377
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,000
Security?

378
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:52,080
Look. Came to her.

379
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,720
Monthly. Do you understand?
- What?

380
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,960
Need it "pads".
- Yeah, "pads".

381
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:01,320
Pakiz. Faster!

382
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,120
Not permitted Pakiz.

383
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,960
Go money.

384
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,480
Enough?
- Yes.

385
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:43,960
Plan "B" work.

386
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,720
Give me your hairpin.

387
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,120
Can you open it?
- It's in my genes.

388
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:58,600
My uncle was a mechanic.
- Hurry. Pakiz come.

389
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,000
One second.

390
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,000
Done!

391
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,080
See there, I from that country.

392
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,800
Not very messy.
No need to know that we were here.

393
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:29,120
Look!
It is stupefying.

394
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:52,600
Got money?
- Yes, very much. One more thing.

395
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,280
Gun ?
In jail?

396
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,160
Did not you say that your uncle was also a gunsmith?
- My father taught me to use a weapon.

397
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,960
What do we do?

398
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:39,600
Give the rope!

399
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:56,440
Hey, it's your turn.
- I'm sorry, honey.

400
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,800
What is it?
Zamechta or what?

401
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,720
Yes. I have a dream, an idea.

402
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,640
For what?
- Forget it.

403
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:18,680
What do we do now?
If you run, we will issue.

404
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,920
You have to kill her.
- You must be joking.

405
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,840
We have no choice.

406
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,360
Although... what did you do with sleeping pills?

407
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,240
Choose. Or will drink pills
or I'll kill you.

408
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,880
'll Drink pills? Excellent.

409
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,880
Lord! Fainted!

410
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:07,640
What are you doing?
- So does my dog's vet.

411
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,760
Will now sleep until Tuesday.

412
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:15,200
Thanks for the watch.

413
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,120
Almost 14:30. We have half an hour,
to bribe one of the guards.

414
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,520
Ready?
- Yes.

415
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,400
Ready .
- Let's do it.

416
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,800
He's waiting.

417
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,040
We will come in a few minutes.
Be careful.

418
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:40,920
Log.

419
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,440
Mr. Child, late.

420
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,880
Waiting for you, come.

421
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:59,600
This is my friend, Achim.
It is Beirut.

422
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,560
Nice to meet you.
- Sit.

423
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,440
Do you want a glass of whiskey?
- No, thank you.

424
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,920
Miss Child, I want to show you something.

425
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:20,200
I found this in his office.
It belongs to your girlfriends.

426
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,320
What have conceived,
tell me about it.

427
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,920
Nothing to say?
Let's see.

428
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:57,080
How are soft.

429
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,280
As my purse.

430
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,600
Do you want this?

431
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,080
Then speak.
- I have nothing to say!

432
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,200
Yours.

433
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,840
Go to  tricks.
- I hope that the same guard.

434
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:38,680
We will be here.

435
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:53,880
This is another guard.
- Do not stop.

436
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:09,280
Where are you going?
- Open, it will show.

437
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:31,640
Do not resist.
- Stop!

438
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,520
You took me for a fool?

439
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,360
Answer! Now!

440
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,480
Shut up, fat boy.

441
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:08,640
How do you know?
- I know all what's going on.

442
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,840
Need my help.

443
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:16,440
Do not pull or
get a ticket to heaven.

444
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,880
We have to hurry.
Do not sleep.

445
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,700
What's taking so long?

446
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:35,701
Open your mouth, asshole.

447
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:40,640
Close his mouth!

448
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:45,440
God's ways are mysterious.
To get out.

449
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,560
What the hell?
- She saved our lives!

450
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:57,360
Colleen, I also want her to
out of here. Trust me.

451
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,480
Well, it's time to kick someone's ass
.

452
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,760
Damn!
- Take care of them.

453
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,960
Give the rope!

454
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:45,760
Release me!
- Glad you're alive.

455
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:56,561
Run, run!

456
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:05,880
Lord shall not escape.

457
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:08,960
Tie him until he woke up.
- We're out of pills.

458
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:13,760
I will cut his throat.
- Do not kill him.

459
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:19,400
Who is this?
- Vendor. He came to take us.

460
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,120
Clock Pakiz behind!
- Guard waiting.

01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:33,120
Get out.
- A tight tie.

462
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:35,600
Come on, Helen!

463
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,880
I should kill you.

464
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:46,040
Clear.

465
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,960
Colleen forgot something. I'll catch up.
- Bonnie, where...

466
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,840

- I'll be late!

467
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:01,600
Go. Wait for me in the car.
Here's the keys.

468
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,480
Some like soft bags.

469
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:40,720
I personally like portfolios.
- Not...

470
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,840
How are you?
- Six.

471
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:55,720

01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:40,480
Do not kill me!
- Give me back my money.

475
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:05,238
Let's go.

476
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,240
Too late!

477
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,120
My God!

478
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:28,720
We need to find out.

479
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:35,480
They remained there, and we are here.

480
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:46,840
No way.
- It's our only chance.

481
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,800
Help me.
- Come on.

482
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:59,160
I can not come.

483
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,520
What do we do now?
- I need to remove it.

484
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:37,440
Do you know how to use it?
- Yes.

485
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:42,480
Cover me, but shoot only
if necessary.

486
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,840
Guard kill them!
- No, no.

487
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,240
Where is Elena?
- Dead.

488
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,320
Why come back?
- He had lost it.

489
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:56,000
So back because the earrings?
- Yes, its a few more little things.

490
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:06,160
Bend over!

491
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:19,760
We are free!

492
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,320
Did it!
