1
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,183
Ninety percent of cops...

2
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,813
go through their entire career
without ever fiiring their gun.

3
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:29,793
On that day, there was roughly
1 ,500 rounds fired.

4
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,091
We were armed with pistols.

5
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,224
These guys were slinging
automatic machine guns.

6
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,803
An AK-47 machine gun...

7
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,136
is a weapon
that was designed for war.

8
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,837
High-velocity rounds
were invented...

9
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,404
to penetrate armor
and kill their target.

10
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,152
Use them in a bank job...

11
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:58,781
and you've done something that
no one in America has ever done before.

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:04,589
Danger's all around us--
in the streets...

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,290
in your car...

14
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,268
maybe even the guy next door.

15
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,949
Come on. Drink, drink, drink, drink.!

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,023
- Yeah?
- The music.

17
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,492
- For God's sakes,
will you turn it down a bit?
- Um, right.

18
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:22,499
- You okay?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,103
Let it go.

20
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,389
Aw!

21
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,524
- Turn it back on, man.

22
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,003
What'd they say?

23
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,046
Nothin'.

24
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:26,431
- What's so funny?
- Our life.

25
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:31,306
Well,Jim, Kelly,
the forecast, plenty of sunshine
with seasonal temperatures.

26
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,436
Looking for a high
of 7 2 degrees by midday.

27
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,846
Lord, help me to remember
there are many paths and one truth.

28
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,246
Help me to do the right thing
out there.

29
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,871
Wake up, Larry.

30
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,436
Oh, shit.

31
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,014
Shit, what time is it?

32
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,675
- Let's go. Let's go.
It's the morning time.
- Make some coffee.

33
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,169
Unreal.

34
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,468
You know any of'em?

35
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,543
Yeah, Davis.
He was a good man.

36
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,578
We went through
the academy together.

37
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,551
- So, you gonna mail those taxes today?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,917
- Don't forget to get a return--
- Get a receipt. Right.

39
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,965
Mm.

40
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,838
Be careful.

41
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,879
My father was my hero
and a legend in the LAPD.

42
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,177
He died in his patrol car
of a heart attack.

43
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,377
He was, uh,
he was 62 at the time.

44
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,858
All I ever wanted
was to bejust like him.

45
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,830
And my dad was proud.
He loved it when I made SWAT.

46
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,263
Go for a walk?
Wanna go for a walk?

47
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,241
Good boy.
Come on.

48
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,486
Let's go.

49
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,591
See, we're SWAT. That stands for
Special Weapons And Tactics.

50
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,718
And we respond
to any situation.

51
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,059
Regular uniform patrol,
you know...

52
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,894
wouldn't really have the firepower
or the training to handle.

53
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,492
- Police, coming in.!
- Open door!

54
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,503
This way?

55
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,664
- I got point.!
- Let me see your hands.!

56
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,935
- Get down on the ground.!
- Stay with me, Donnie.

57
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,307
- Down, now, down.!

58
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,539
- You, get down! Get down!
- Get down, now!

59
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,709
Drop your weapon!
I need a trailer!

60
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,752
I got guns.!
I got guns.!

61
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,550
- Cover him! Shit!
- Donnie, get in here.!

62
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,683
Where the hell were you?

63
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,261
I got multiple suspects here.

64
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,198
Donnie, what the hell happened in there?
You left me completely alone.

65
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,899
Yeah, I was there.

66
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,907
Hey, you gotta
take it down a notch, partner.

67
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,103
Don't worry about me, all right?
Wrap this up and get in the car.

68
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,146
You did good.

69
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,748
Good morning, half past the hour...

70
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,823
and it looks like another beautiful day
in the City of Angels.

71
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,293
For the latest on your commute,
let's go high in the sky with
our own Captain Chuck Scott.

72
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:00,798
Well,Jim, Kelly,
traffic's moving fairly well
for a getaway Friday.

73
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,767
Couple of trouble spots we'll be
telling you about in our next update.

74
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,999
Right now, clear blue skies,
wind out of the northeast by 1 5.

75
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,599
And we will have a complete
traffic break for you coming up in 1 0.

76
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,977
R.H.D.--
Robbery Homicide Division.

77
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:21,110
We're the best of the best,
and we get all the high-profile cases.

78
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,279
LA Confidential.

79
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,723
Al Pacino in Heat.

80
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,421
Joe Friday and all that.

81
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,732
The only difference is that, uh...

82
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:38,065
those guys don't have to juggle
7 5 cases all at once.

83
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,037
Me, I've got to prioritize.

84
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,041
Back in '95, my priority was them.

85
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:48,807
We had a name for them. We called them
the High Incident Bandits.

86
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,611
Chatsworth, two years prior...

87
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,450
these guys decided to make
an early withdrawal.

88
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,456
They kill a guard.

89
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,119
They executed him.
Ambushed him.

90
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,893
Took his head off
with an AK-47.

91
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,562
That kind of firepower
in a bank job is unheard of.

92
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,402
These guys were an anomaly.

93
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,137
I made a promise to that widow
that I wouldn't quit...

94
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,975
until I caught up
with the sons ofbitches
that killed her husband.

95
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,572
We make promises like that
all the time in my line of work.

96
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,051
And we like to think
that we mean it.

97
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,181
That time, I really meant it.

98
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,226
Six months later,
another armored car.

99
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:41,231
Then, two more banks-- takeover style--
the most dangerous kind.

100
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,632
They, uh, got away
with over two million dollars.

101
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,968
I guess they wanted
to live the good life...

102
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,440
and they wanted to live it
pretty fast...

103
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,411
instead of getting a job
like the rest of us.

104
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,448
Anyway, they disappeared
into the wind one day,
but I knew they'd be back.

105
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,348
Hey, did you see that?
A Porsche 91 1 .

106
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,021
- Oh, I love those.
- I hate the Germans.

107
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,360
You're from Romania.
That practically makes you a German.

108
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,069
I'm an American...

109
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:23,301
and I like Corvettes and Mustangs.

110
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,934
If you're going for horsepower and
good looks, nothing wrong with that.

111
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,573
Corvettes and Mustangs
and Mexican girls.
I love that girl over there.

112
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,994
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, Luis.

113
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,087
So, what do you think
of my new wheels?

114
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,860
Wow, that's great, man.
I really love gold.

115
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,868
- Champagne.
- Huh?

116
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,870
It's the color.
It's called champagne.

117
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,463
- Oh.

118
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:59,203
Hey, keep working hard
and one day you'll be able
to afford champagne.

119
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,245
Oh, I sure hope so, sir.

120
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,543
I sure hope so.
Dick.

121
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,025
Ow! Geez!

122
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,595
- You all right?
- It's nothing.

123
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,927
Hey, you can say if it hurts.
It's okay, tough Robo-girl.

124
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,194
- Hey!
- Oh, here we go...

125
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,429
with that whole
""women can handle it'' attitude...

126
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,438
because of childbirth
and years and years of pain.

127
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,772
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
You couldn't stand the pain
of childbirth, Henry.

128
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,776
Better you than me, sister girl.

129
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,280
I tell you what I could stand.
You need to take me out with
a salsa honey and teach me how.

130
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,010
- I can salsa dance.
- Don't start that again.
You'll embarrass me.

131
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,279
- I've got flavor. I got mad flavor.
- Yeah, I know, okay?

132
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,652
- I know you can move it, but--
- Central Nine Adam 3 7.

133
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,158
Nine Adam 37, go ahead.

134
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,718
Possible 4 1 5 family.
52 42 Radford.

135
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,267
Nine Adam 37, roger.

136
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,437
You're my little sweetie.
Come on.

137
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,668
Just coming up over
the Hollywood Freeway where
it is slow going this morning.

138
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:08,338
There's a SIG alert south of Highland.
A tractor trailer is broken down
in the number-one lane.

139
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,382
If you're travelling north,
consider using side streets.

140
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,230
They're late.

141
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,366
They'll be here.
Just stay cool.

142
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,374
I'm cool.

143
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,339
I'm cool.
It's just so freakin' hot in here.

144
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,018
Try taking three of these.

145
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,588
It'll definitely help
calm you down.

146
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,919
Don't worry about it.

147
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,334
That's about it for out here.
Let me show you the vault.

148
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,534
I have one key,
and Randy has the other, okay?

149
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,305
- It won't open with just mine.
- Okay.

150
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,346
Let me show you something.

151
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,785
A little tool of the the trade here.
You know what this is?

152
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,412
- Twenties.
- No. Two bands.

153
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,287
See here? Dye pack.

154
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,156
Dye pack. Gotcha.

155
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,957
We keep one in here,
one in each of the drawers.

156
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,897
You try and leave the bank with this,
and the battery...

157
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,968
makes the red dye
explode all over the bills.

158
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,396
It's the bomb.

159
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,567
One time we had this robber, right.
He leaves the bank with this...

160
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,407
drops it on the way out, picks it up,
shoves it down his pants and boom.

161
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,450
It goes off. I don't think
he's gonna be having kids any time soon.

162
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,177
Did you, uh, get robbed a lot?

163
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,985
About three or four times. But not here.
At the other branches I worked at.

164
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,795
Look. It's all insured, okay?
You never argue.

165
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,128
Look. It's all insured, okay?
You never argue.

166
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,428
-Just give them what they want.
- Okay.

167
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,436
- All right? Let's go get some coffee.
- Okay.

168
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,871
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

169
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,911
At that point, I kicked the door.

170
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,947
I understand the old guy
had to get seven stitches.

171
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,947
That doesn't concern me.

172
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,543
What does concern me is that
you went charging in there
like some freakin'John Wayne...

173
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,646
and left your partner alone
in a room with four felons.

174
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,424
I know you've been going
through a tough time, son.
Your father was a great--

175
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,158
Lieutenant, I'm fine.
That's got nothing to do with it.
I had a bad day.

176
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,496
Nine thousand cops
in the LAPD, Donnie...

177
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,127
and only 60 are good enough
to make it to SWAT.

178
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,674
We can't afford
to have bad days.

179
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,101
Now, you're taking
some time off to mourn, kid.

180
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:58,275
I need you making decisions,
the right decisions, from here on in.

181
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,820
Next time it might not be some
7 0-year-old man behind that door.

182
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,117
- I don't need the time off.
- And I'm not asking your opinion.

183
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,924
That's all.

184
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,789
Here you go, Frank.

185
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,494
- Thank you, Ralph.
- Good as new.

186
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,163
Should last you another 20 years.

187
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,639
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

188
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,040
But what about me?

189
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,147
You're a survivor, Frank.
You know that.

190
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,181
Let's hope so.

191
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,480
- Hey, Donnie.
- Frank.

192
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,718
- How are you?
- Not bad.

193
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,557
Sorry to hear about your old man.
He was, uh, he was good.

194
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,559
You guys worked together.
77 th, right?

195
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,034
He was my T.O.
Kicked my ass every day for six months.

196
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,576
It was a different department
back then.

197
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,146
So I hear.

198
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,483
I gotta run.
Gotta be in court.

199
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,647
So, uh, look after yourself,yeah?

200
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,351
- I'll see you later, Frank. Thanks.
- All right. Yeah.

201
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,061
Well, I'm a training officer,
and Bobby is probably the 30th...

202
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,935
or 3 2nd younger officer
that I've trained.

203
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,371
Ayoung cop needs to learn,
more than anything...

204
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:35,004
how to leap to that training
that you get, mentally...

205
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,672
when you're in
an emergency situation.

206
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,716
Bobby, is it clean?

207
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,718
It is now.
Morning watch brought in a hype.

208
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,720
Found two needles
in the backseat.

209
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,983
Uh-oh. You get stuck?

210
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,389
- Had my gloves on.
- Attaboy. Tires?

211
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,621
At least 50 more miles of treads left.

212
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,754
- Twelve-gauge?
- Four rounds, double-aught buck.

213
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,127
- Tank?
- Full.

214
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,098
Coffee?

215
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,664
Black.

216
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,399
You keep this up,
I might let you have lunch today.

217
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,842
Hit me, huh?

218
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,683
- I will take you out!
- Calm down, please.

219
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,015
Come on! I will whip your ass
right now. Let me go!

220
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,453
- It's your lucky day. Let's go.
- Calm down right now.

221
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,660
Ramon, how old are you, man?

222
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,956
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen. That's good.

223
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,555
I don't understand
what's happened to him.

224
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,568
- Is he using or running with a gang?
- Hell, who knows?

225
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,329
No more juvie hall for you, huh?

226
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,340
No, you hang with the big boys now.

227
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,445
They're gonna love you, baby.

228
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,412
You gonna be someone's date
for the prom tonight, huh?

229
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,719
There's no father to help me with this.
I'm doing it all by myself.

230
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,721
- I know, ma'am.
- He's a man now.
How can I stand up to a man?

231
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,792
- I see. I see.
- It's just me.
I'm doing everything I can.

232
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,862
That's a good move too, man,
joining Florencia.

233
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,830
What's that, about two of them
dying a week these days?

234
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,867
Nigga, don't know
nothin' about me, man.

235
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,902
Tell you what.
I know this.

236
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,335
You mess with
your moms again, man--

237
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,566
Domestic violence
ain't no joke.

238
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,843
For six months, he was doing okay.

239
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,845
Getting okay grades,
going to school every day.

240
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,348
Then his principal calls me and tells me
he hasn't been to school in two months.

241
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,475
And you didn't know about this?

242
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,247
I've been working. I get up early.
I go to work. I get home late.

243
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,347
Mm-hmm. How many jobs
you work, ma'am?

244
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,562
- What's your problem, man?
- Nigga made it good...

245
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,496
now you come back to the hood
all enlightened and shit?

246
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,068
Please, man!

247
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,673
Ramon, let me tell you something.

248
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,800
You recognize him? Huh?

249
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,469
Wasn't he the leader
of your gang there?

250
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,208
I mean, until he lost
his mind and his nuts?

251
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,250
You don't like my book?
Take a look at my book.

252
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,321
Oh, I got another guy here.
Check it out.

253
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,481
Huh. That's O-dog, right there.

254
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,617
You know him? I had O-dog,
just where you're sitting,just now.

255
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,628
You know, I need to get me
a picture of you.

256
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,063
See that way I can have
a before... and an after.

257
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,209
Now,you didn't like
my picture book, Ramon?

258
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,244
Huh?

259
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,777
How do you think
you're gonna end up?

260
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,476
How you gonna get it, Ramon?
Like him?

261
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,922
You need to think about that.

262
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,612
These guys are media junkies.
Robbin'banks in the morning...

263
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,715
and watching themselves
on television in the afternoon.

264
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,019
Hello, Frank.

265
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,684
Hey.

266
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,989
- Testifying in the Cortez case?
- Who's gonna cover it? You?

267
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,690
Care to comment on that?

268
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,097
Yeah, the cop.
I think he's guilty.

269
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,568
Actually, there are
three cops involved.

270
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,663
Well, then, all three of them
must be guilty.

271
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,770
I mean, that's what you're gonna
say anyway, right?

272
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,574
- Right.
- So now you've got a source.

273
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,250
Back in '65,
it was the Watts riots.

274
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,116
Then, early '7 0s,
the Hillside Strangler...

275
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,553
and, uh, the Night Stalker.

276
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,716
You got everybody
good and scared.

277
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,556
So afraid, they couldn't even
come out of their houses at night.

278
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,529
Then, along came the early '90s...

279
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,895
Rodney King beatings, and, uh...

280
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,197
well, by then, we all became
a bunch of racists, right?

281
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,507
It's gonna be a while.Judge had to hear
a PI motion in part 49.

282
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,339
What does that translate to,
an 8:00 a.m. tee time at Riviera?

283
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,414
- More or less.
- How long do you think?

284
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,348
- Couple hours.
- All right. Thanks.

285
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,319
You know, you forgot O.J.

286
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,983
- Did I? Well, imagine that.
- Uh-huh.

287
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,323
I'll tell you what.

288
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,694
Why don't you come by
my house some evening...

289
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,431
and, uh, I'll show you
my Bruno Magli shoe, size 1 0 1 /2.

290
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,838
I only got one though.
I left the other one
somewhere in Brentwood.

291
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,173
- Bye, Frank.
- See ya.

292
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,287
- There you go, chief.
- Gracias, señor.

293
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,089
- Payback.
- You're gonna get us in trouble, Henry.

294
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,095
You see that kid
in the car right there?

295
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,961
He's the one in trouble, not us.

296
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,330
Sometimes you gotta do
what you can do to reach somebody.

297
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,736
That's very noble, Henry, but showing
crime-scene photos of a live case.

298
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,738
- And playing preacher--
- You know what?

299
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,844
Just 'cause you don't
stand up for your own beliefs,
doesn't mean I don't for mine.

300
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:10,937
Hey, you don't know shit
about my beliefs, Henry.

301
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:15,451
All I'm saying is these days you even
look at a suspect the wrong way...

302
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,749
and the department gets sued.

303
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,620
And our asses get hauled off
before a trial board. All right?

304
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,438
Slide over.

305
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,976
Turn around so I can uncuff you.

306
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,088
You hungry?

307
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,784
I brought you some food.

308
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,125
Here we go.

309
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,615
- Where's he going?
- That's not our guy.

310
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,243
Shit!

311
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,193
Screw this shit, man.

312
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,724
- Can you guys set up? And you,
don't forget about Friday.
- [ Group ] Yes.

313
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,629
- It's your turn to buy margaritas, huh?
- That's right.

314
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,827
- Luis, can you open up for me?
- Yes, sir. I'm gonna do that.

315
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,870
- Listen.
- Thanks. What's up with Bagstrom?

316
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,135
- It's on your desk.
- Okay. Great.

317
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,176
judy.

318
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,877
Morning.
How's everybody doing today?

319
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:35,858
Change of plans.
We do the bank.

320
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:42,458
- Okay. I'm with you. Let's do the bank.

321
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,708
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

322
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,870
- Hey.
- Did you get to go back to sleep?

323
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,608
- No, I couldn't.
- No, it doesn't work, does it?

324
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,480
So, you, um,
heading anywhere special?

325
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,521
- Going to the post office.
- Good to hear it.

326
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,615
Uh, you, uh,
gonna be late tonight?

327
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,624
I think I'll call it off early today.

328
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,423
Oh, great. Okay.
I'll talk to you later, baby.

329
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,998
- I love you, honey.
- Love you too.

330
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,033
When you're a cop...

331
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,866
you have to make
split-second decisions.

332
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,872
Sometimes it's life or death.

333
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,306
Then, everybody else--
your boss...

334
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,313
and the police commission
and all the reporters--

335
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:35,853
well, they get to take all the time
in the world to, uh...

336
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,856
form an opinion about what it is
that you did and how you did it.

337
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:44,690
It's kinda like
being on trial every day.

338
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,991
And sooner or later, I mean,
how much of that shit can you take?

339
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,230
You wake up one morning and you say,
""That's it. I wanna turn in my papers.''

340
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,494
Everyone's got an S.U. V.
They're nice.

341
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,502
Yeah, and they're fun to drive too.

342
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,744
Shit!

343
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,520
- Shit. Hang on.
- 21 1 .

344
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,404
- Everybody down!

345
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,441
On the floor!

346
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,422
Heads down!

347
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,629
Move and you die!
Don't look at my face!

348
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:31,964
1 5-A-39,
we have a possible 21 1 in progress.

349
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,699
- 6600 Laurel Canyon. Bank of America.
- Go! Go! Go!

350
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,709
Multiple suspects armed with AK-47 s.

351
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,870
Officers requesting help.

352
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,847
- 21 1 . Let's clear this street.
- Right!

353
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,213
I'll get the other side.!

354
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,387
All units, 2 1 1 in progress.
6600 Laurel Canyon. Shots fiired.

355
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,585
Nine Adam 37, we're en route.

356
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,460
Let me out here, man. It's cool.

357
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:04,661
Suspects described as
large males wearing body armor
and carrying automatic weapons.

358
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,760
I repeat, multiple shots fired.

359
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,135
I'm en route.

360
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,140
That day, I was ready to say, ""Enough.''

361
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,643
And then... I got the call.

362
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,211
It's not something
that you can turn your back on.

363
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,217
- Stay down!

364
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:34,492
Attention, all Valley units.
Officer needs help, 6600 Laurel Canyon.

365
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,994
''Officer needs help''call is
the most important call you can get.

366
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,130
That means there's somebody,
he's down, he's in trouble.

367
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:47,371
I'm gonna put the call out there,
and anyone in the area,
get your ass over here.

368
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,538
The way I grew up,
the LAPD was family.

369
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,775
My dad was, uh,
a cop for 3 1 years.

370
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,250
Uh, my mom died
when I was very young.

371
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,516
And so these guys
were the people that I knew.
They came over to the house.

372
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,957
They, you know,
we had picnics together.
And, uh, they were my family.

373
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,120
You get
an ''officer needs help''call...

374
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,391
that means your family needs help,
their life is in danger.

375
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,433
It's your job to get there.

376
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,561
We got a 21 1 in progress,
North Hollywood. Officers need help.

377
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,673
Come on. Get your shit.
Let's go.!

378
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,503
Load up the .223s. Leave the MP5s.
We don't need 'em.

379
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,525
Move and you're dead.

380
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:51,272
I did two tours of Vietnam,
and there's two things you never forget.

381
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:56,609
Your number of days in
and the sound of a Chinese-made
AK-47 machine gun.

382
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,018
Now those two guys
were packing AKs...

383
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,920
and I had a nine-millimeter Beretta.

384
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:08,186
I was in the wrong place
with the wrong gun.

385
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,729
1 5-A-39, I want one unit
on the north side.

386
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,769
One unit on the south side.
One unit around back if possible.

387
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,237
Hurry up!

388
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,682
You! The vault!
Open the vault!

389
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,413
- What? What?
- The vault!

390
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,285
- I need a second set of keys.
- Who got them?

391
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,860
- Randy. Over there. Randy? Randy!
- Randy!

392
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,423
- I have the key.
- Hurry up, bitch.

393
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,406
- Faster.!
- All right. Let's not hurt anybody.

394
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,068
- I got the key right here.
- Give it. Give it. Shut up!

395
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,373
On the ground!
Pipe down!

396
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,710
Down!

397
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,415
Head down!

398
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,797
There's something going on out here.
I don't know what it is.

399
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,929
Flying over North Hollywood right now,
where there are several LAPD units...

400
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,976
surrounding what looks to be
a Bank of America building.

401
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,012
One Adam 1 1, we are on scene.

402
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,188
Where is your watch commander?

403
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,507
How long they been in there?

404
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,305
About six minutes.

405
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,939
This is 1 5-L-1 0.
All units, stay off the air.

406
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,849
I repeat, stay off the air
unless you have a genuine emergency.

407
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,852
Do they know we're out here?

408
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,081
I've been ringing
the bank manager's office.
No answer.

409
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,852
I think I know these guys.
They're gonna come out heavy.

410
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,354
I want containment on the rear
of this building right now.

411
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,640
- We need traffic blocked off
on Archwood and Kittridge.
- You got it.

412
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,437
No civilians in.
No suspects out.

413
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,842
Why don't you take the south side?

414
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,312
- All right, go.
- All the way to Kittridge.

415
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,350
Right.
Take another unit.

416
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,920
- Ramon, I'm gonna let you go
under one condition.
- Are you crazy?

417
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,251
You heard the radio.
There's bank robbers everywhere, man.

418
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,996
- That condition is
you stay your ass in school.
- Fine. Let me go, man.

419
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,622
Wait a minute now. I see you got
the cross and crucifix here, right?

420
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,395
Yeah?

421
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,233
All right. You take this.

422
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,569
You're gonna need it more than me.
Go ahead, take it.

423
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,643
A Bible, man?
What am I supposed to do with this?

424
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,234
- I want you to read it.
- Which part?

425
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,541
Whatever part speaks to you.

426
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,173
Ramon, listen. Before you think about
hitting your mama again...

427
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,184
I got her number, she got mine.

428
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,517
I hit back.

429
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,818
Don't end up in my picture book,
brother.

430
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,191
Go on. Go.

431
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,972
You let him go?

432
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,149
Move back inside.

433
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,621
Hey, hey, I'm the one
that called 9 1 1.

434
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,192
These two guys just pulled up and--

435
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,352
Ma'am, we're all over it.
We know. You need to stand back.

436
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,488
- I saw them go into the bank.
- You need to stand back.

437
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,758
The 1 01 southbound
beginning to back up at the 1 7 0.

438
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,771
405 is clear but slow
in both directions.

439
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,499
Assignment desk,
this is Sky Fox.

440
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,133
I'm flying over North Hollywood
right now, and something's
going on down here,you guys.

441
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,577
- Talk about--
- They're surrounding
this Bank of America.

442
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,515
- We're not sure what's going on,
but it's really big.
- I have to call you back.

443
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:32,112
Numerous police units responding
to a ''shots fiired''call.
What do you want me to do?

444
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,720
Bill. Bill!

445
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,696
We got a live feed up.
Bank robbery in progress.
North Hollywood.

446
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,290
- I think we should cut in.
- Police response?

447
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,462
Multiple units. Shots have already
been fired in the bank.

448
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,573
Okay, let's do it. Go live.

449
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:54,110
Okay, everybody ready.
In three, two, one.

450
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,181
We interrupt this
program for a special report
from North Hollywood.

451
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,427
Given the force out here,
they've gotta give up.

452
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,401
Commander?
Hello?

453
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,267
- Hello? Gentlemen, I need a land line.

454
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,600
- You ain't gotta do that, all right?
- Shut up!

455
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,736
Not the safe deposit boxes.
Open this one.

456
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,113
- Okay!
- Fill this up!

457
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,684
You, head down.!

458
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,924
Hurry up.!

459
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,466
I said, ''Head down.!''

460
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,996
Faster! Faster! Faster!

461
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,400
Lieutenant, over here.

462
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,275
You want a driver?
- LAPD.

463
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,044
We got a major incident
going on down the street.

464
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,449
We need your store
and your telephones.

465
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,453
Yes, sir.

466
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,791
Frank, I need you to expand
that perimeter right now.

467
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,919
Let's set up on these tables here.

468
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,998
Down!

469
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,397
Hurry up!

470
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,373
Don't look at me!

471
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,965
The gunmen are still
apparently in the bank.

472
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,840
We don't know how many people
are in the bank at this time.

473
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,414
jim, Kelly, we'll get back to you
as soon as we have any more details.

474
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,685
Between Sherman Way and Oxnard.

475
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,585
I want east and west traffic blocked.

476
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,255
- Air 1 0. How's our perimeter look?
- Go ahead.

477
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:56,265
Yeah, we've got four units
it looks like on--

478
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:13,012
Where's the rest?
Where's the rest?

479
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,312
That's all we've got.
We're waiting for our morning delivery.

480
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,250
Are you lying to me?

481
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,518
No, no. They reduced
the amount of money we keep
because of recent robberies.

482
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,987
Don't shoot me, man.

483
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,258
We are going to the A.T.Ms.
Let's go!

484
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,390
Okay.

485
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,433
- Fast! That's right, stay down.
- Okay.

486
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,147
Everybody, in the vault.
Get up! Move!

487
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,046
- Open it!
- I can't. See?

488
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,488
What the hell does that mean?

489
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,855
They changed the policy.
Only armed transport can open it.

490
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,222
Shit!

491
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,898
We just gonna sit here?

492
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,269
We can't run in. We need to get
a possible position on them.

493
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:15,038
We rush 'em now, there's civilians
in the background, somebody gets hurt.

494
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,741
Conflicting numbers.
We don't know who's still
inside the bank.

495
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,784
People in there,
whether or not they were shot.

496
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,820
Wejust don't know.

497
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,893
Hit the deck! Shut up!

498
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,292
Don't look at my face!

499
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,734
What's taking so damn long?

500
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,580
We're burnin' time.
What are you doin'?

501
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,014
Piece of shit says
he can't open them.

502
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,279
Open it, bitch!

503
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,287
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

504
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,380
- I can't!
- Open it!

505
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,993
- We're hearing some more shots
fiired inside.

506
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,379
How do we open this stupid thing?

507
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,914
I don't have the combination.

508
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,247
Stupid. Come on!

509
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,151
- Move! Go!
- We're movin'out.!

510
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,918
Okay. What are you gonna do now?

511
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,925
In the vault.

512
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,431
These guys weren't playing games.
The black masks, the eyes.

513
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:45,628
That guy just looked at me, you know.
I'll never forget it.

514
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,705
It was scary, you know. I didn't think
I was gonna get out of there, really.

515
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,774
I thought-- I thought
you were gonna be, you know...

516
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,173
seeing one dead Latino right here.

517
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,178
You know.

518
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,181
Go down!

519
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,719
You all go down.

520
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,755
Larry, we got the money.

521
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,125
Who's there?

522
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,126
Cops.

523
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,254
I don't know what it is.

524
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,296
Hey, hang on. Go back!

525
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,832
- Mike, get me a shot of the bank.
Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

526
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,877
Set up right here.
This is great.

527
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,879
Here.

528
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,128
Turn it around.
Come on. Turn it around.

529
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,358
- Some roadblock.
- You can't come this way.
You have to find another way.

530
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,661
I have an important meeting
in the studio in 1 0 minutes.

531
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,431
Your meeting will be with the coroner
if you don't listen to me.

532
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,507
- Back it up and move out now!
- You guys are always blocking--

533
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,109
You can't go this way, sir.
You must go back.

534
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,441
- And take a left. Go. Back it out now.

535
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,175
She's telling me to move.
I can't believe this.

536
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,841
We can't confiirm at this time
how many gunmen.

537
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,154
We are monitoring the situation.
We're gonna stay overhead
as long as we can.

538
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,021
We are monitoring the situation.
We're gonna stay overhead
as long as we can.

539
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,156
LAPD.! Drop your weapon.!

540
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,756
I repeat, drop your weapon.!

541
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,570
I can see two gunmen are leaving--

542
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,344
- Return fiire.! Return fiire.!
- Get down.! Get down.!

543
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,418
Return fiire.!

544
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,047
Return fiire.!

545
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,051
Civilian down!

546
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,103
R.A. units are responding.
- Shooting hundreds of rounds.

547
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,077
1 5-L-1 0, suspects
are exiting the bank.

548
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,738
They're wearing body armor
with AK-47 s.

549
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,747
I repeat, they have body armor.

550
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,716
Anyone with a head shot, take it.

551
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,949
Guys, we're looking at
multiple suspects, assault rifles
and body armor.

552
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:57,494
Do not deploy the MP5s.
Leave 'em in the trunk.
We're gonna go 223s only.

553
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,732
I'm hitting them,
but they're not going down!

554
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,031
- They got Kevlar. Head shots.
- Aim for the head.

555
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,900
Aim high.!

556
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,157
Hold it.! Here.! Cover me.!

557
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:15,035
These guys are
out of their minds. They'rejust
shooting hundreds of rounds.

558
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,413
Hang in there, partner.

559
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,299
Jim and Kelly,
I'm here live on Laurel Canyon
in North Hollywood...

560
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,344
where a bank robbery
is currently in progress.

561
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:59,472
What you hear behind me
is not coming from a movie set.
It is actual gunfiire.

562
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,983
The details are coming in slowly,
but when we arrived--

563
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,576
- The North Hollywood site--
- ...bank in North Hollywood--

564
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,588
LAPD officers--

565
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,749
Once again, we are in
a fiirestorm ofbullets.

566
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,419
The gunmen are now shooting
at anything and everything.

567
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:15,999
Officers from all over LAPD
have been asked to respond
and are trying to--

568
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,567
Being the wife of a cop,
you learn that every day...

569
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,193
any day, could be the day
that he doesn't come home.

570
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:25,264
So, you can either
obsess and go crazy...

571
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:29,209
or you do what I did,
which is, uh, denial.

572
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,577
I mean, you know
that bad stuff happens...

573
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,483
but you just think, um...

574
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:41,820
""Not my guy.
He's too good. He's too smart.''

575
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,251
So, most days, that worked for me.

576
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:49,297
But, uh, that day, it didn't.

577
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,349
Cover me.!

578
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,274
An officer who was trying
to help a civilian has been shot.

579
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:39,145
He's down. I can't tell from here
ifhe's moving or not.

580
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,911
But he appears
to be seriously hurt.

581
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,214
Rescue units are unable
to get to either of them.

582
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,104
All responding units
to Laurel Canyon--

583
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,656
Frank. Thank God.

584
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,824
- So, where are you?
- Don't worry about anything. I'm okay.

585
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,834
I guess you're watching TV, yeah?

586
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:37,168
Oh, yeah. It's on every channel.
They say there's officers down.

587
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,834
Patty, look. I'm not even close
to the action. I'm okay.

588
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,843
Everything's fine.
I'm all right.

589
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,845
- I don't want you to worry about me.
- I'm not worried.

590
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:48,680
No one's worrying, okay? I just--
I just want you to be careful, okay?

591
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:52,687
Everything's going to be okay.
I'll see you later. I gotta go.

592
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,758
- Bye.
- ...of this part of the Valley
are to remain where they are.

593
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,056
I don't know if you can see this,
but the police cars...

594
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,220
are literally being
ripped apart by bullets.

595
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,764
Bullets are going
clear through the cars.

596
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,562
At least one LAPD officer
has been hit at this time.

597
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,594
Henry. Henry! Hey.

598
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,567
Nicole. I want you
to do me a favor.

599
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,233
You got it, Henry.
Whatever you want, buddy.

600
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,176
Why don't you go ahead
and pray for me.

601
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,509
I already have.

602
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,412
Then I know I'm gonna be all right.

603
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:58,011
The 1 70's really starting to back up
as the LAPD have closed the exits...

604
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,955
at Burbank and Victory off the 1 70.

605
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,026
Oh, what a mess.

606
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,488
Command post, this is 43 David.
I need someone on tac-one right now.

607
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,430
- Donnie, what's your E.T.A.?
- Frank, I'm about 1 0 minutes out.

608
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:23,570
I'm gonna need
someone to walk me in here.
This off-ramp's like a parking lot.

609
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,615
Confirmed. Multiple suspects,
body armor, AKs.

610
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,616
It looks like our guys, Donnie.

611
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,298
We train so we're ready.

612
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,961
That way what we do, it's automatic.
We don't have to think about it.

613
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,402
It's second nature.
It just comes instinctively.

614
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:53,806
No, I don't think they have
any intention of giving up.
They've seen our resources.

615
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,851
Firing nonstop.

616
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:10,789
- Back inside!
- I can see they have gone
back into the bank.

617
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,459
Shit. There was a lot of them out there.

618
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,500
- We got these.
- Yeah, right.

619
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,070
They got nothing but their dicks
in their hands.

620
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:28,339
Multiple officers
and civilians are lying wounded,
some critically in the streets.

621
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,141
There's also an unconfiirmed report
of another uniformed officer...

622
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,182
that has been shot several times.

623
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,843
- Rescue units are unable
to help either of them.
- We can't wait for SWAT.

624
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,351
- You're bleeding. You're bleeding.
- What?

625
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,564
- Oh, that's a scratch.
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

626
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,801
Four years earlier,
these two guys were arrested...

627
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,896
in a routine vehicle stop.

628
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,568
The sergeant of the Glendale PD
found an AK-47...

629
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:04,408
and 1 ,200 rounds of ammunition
in their trunk.

630
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:09,008
They went to jail for six months,
and, uh, walked out.

631
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,553
And then the judge
gave them their guns back.

632
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,590
Their attorneys said they needed
to sell them to pay their legal fees.

633
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,662
Can you believe that shit?

634
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,629
Harris.! Hey, Harris.!

635
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,464
- Yeah, what?
- You're right in the line of fire.

636
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,439
- Get your ass over here.
- Oh, you mean, back there
by the gas tank? No, thanks.

637
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,440
Moron.

638
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:42,049
1 5-L-1 0, requesting
a V-1 00 RA unit.

639
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,644
Copy that.
V-1 00 rescue unit is on its way.

640
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:55,797
All units, we are on a citywide
tac alert. All units on citywide
tac alert till further notice.

641
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,868
1 5-L-1 0, hold your positions.
They could be coming back out.

642
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,033
I repeat, hold your positions.

643
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,133
Henry. Henry!

644
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,043
Hey, Henry.
Do you hear me?

645
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,741
The RA's coming, Henry.
You hang in there.

646
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,977
Henry, hey.

647
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:22,991
Henry,you hear me?
Henry.

648
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,186
- Get the hell outta here!
- Okay.

649
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,856
Get that camera outta here!
You're gonna get yourself killed.

650
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,932
Stay with me, buddy.

651
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:40,032
- Stay with me, Henry.
- Officer needs assistance.

652
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,111
Unit requesting help.
What is your location?

653
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,237
9-L-49.

654
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,782
I need help.

655
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:52,651
9-L-49, hang in there.
Help is on the way.
What is your location?

656
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,020
9-L-49, what is your location?

657
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:01,191
9-L-49.
9-L-49.

658
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,633
9-L-49?
9-L-49.

659
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,967
- 9-L-49.

660
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,940
Officer down.
Officer down, code three.
He needs help. Code three.

661
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:27,982
Hey! We gotta get
that man outta here fast.
He's not gonna make it.

662
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,787
- What do you have in mind?
- I'm gonna take this car.

663
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,556
- Pull around. Wait for me.
- All right.

664
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,657
Henry. Henry,
you hang in there.

665
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,936
We're coming for you.

666
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:47,374
You drive, I'll cover.

667
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,775
Just create enough chaos,
and we're bound to slip through.

668
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,506
Right. Right.

669
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,844
Very little movement
down there right now.

670
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,680
The suspects are
still inside presumably.

671
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,949
Police have not begun to move in.
They're still behind their vehicles.

672
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,219
You know, I just remember,
I got my Visa from this bank.

673
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,887
No shit.
Hey, you make it out of this alive...

674
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,431
you oughta ask them
to waive your balance.

675
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,997
If we get separated,
I'll meet you at the safe house tonight.

676
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,239
I'd rather die than go to jail
for the rest of my life.

677
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,711
That's right.
We'll do it. We'll do it.

678
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,612
- I'm not going to jail.
- I'm not going to jail.

679
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,878
I'm not going to jail!

680
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,135
Wait. Hold on. The gunmen--
- Coming out again!

681
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,445
Hey!

682
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,591
Come on!

683
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,752
Come on!

684
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,332
It looks like there's
a rescue mission underway.

685
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,460
Despite the gunfiire, two officers
have scrambled out of their car...

686
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,597
and are pulling
another policeman to safety.

687
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,509
This is unbelievable.
He's driving directly--

688
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,134
This is unbelievable.
He's driving directly--

689
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,643
I was at a point where it was--
was out of my hands.

690
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,645
It wasn't in my control anymore.

691
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,341
Literally, whether
I was going to live or die.

692
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:11,250
And, uh, they say
that if you lose...

693
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:21,027
I was scared and...

694
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,429
I went back to a place where...

695
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,230
I remember...

696
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,999
chasing a suspect on foot.

697
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,684
He fiired at me,
and I went for cover.

698
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,353
I guess, in some ways,
maybe I stayed too long.

699
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,455
The suspect got away
and eventually turned up...

700
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:57,088
robbed, uh, some folks
and killed somebody.

701
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:01,465
And there's a part of you
that you know...

702
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,005
maybe you didn't
do your best.

703
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,133
And, uh, because you didn't
do your best that day,
someone got hurt.

704
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,008
I guess I knew that
on this day, I was gonna do...

705
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:15,016
whatever I could do
to help my fellow officers...

706
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,176
to make sure that this time,
the bad guys didn't get away.

707
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,882
They didn't--
They didn't hurt anybody again.
They didn't kill again.

708
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,525
Incredible. I gotta tell you.

709
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,596
I am watching this and I still,
I can't believe it's happening.

710
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,569
The money, Larry.
The money!

711
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,009
Fifty cops outside.

712
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,742
He turned around
and strolled right back in...

713
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,216
without a care in the world,
like it was nothing.

714
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,914
- What the hell's he doin'?
- Look at the duffel.

715
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,959
Whoever put that dye pack in there
is gonna be dead.

716
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,088
Man. Total disregard for life.

717
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,150
The devastation is terrible...

718
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:28,383
as the gunmen continue to fire
at the police officers as they
try to make their getaway.

719
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:32,518
Dozens of officers and
civilians have been wounded,
but reports are telling us...

720
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,121
- that ambulances are being held
until the danger has been cleared.

721
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:47,241
Absolute war zone down there.
The fiiring continues.

722
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,103
...keep the police
pinned down...

723
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,039
although these brave officers
are refusing to back down.

724
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,877
It looks like one of the gunmen
has reached into his car.

725
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,726
Want some?

726
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,891
Come on, pig!

727
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,266
Continue to fiire at him.

728
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,282
43-David. We are eastbound
in an alley heading toward Laurel.

729
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,287
Should be there in two minutes.

730
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:16,729
The policemen's return fiire
doesn't seem to have any effect.

731
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,563
The rounds just keep coming--
Whoa.!

732
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,637
Wait. He's shootin' at us.
We're gonna have to get outta here.

733
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,900
- Looks like he's taking shots
right up there.
- Yeah.

734
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,339
Get up! Get out of there!
Higher!

735
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,674
- And are firing at will.
It is complete chaos here.

736
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,907
- Pratt.
- Yes, sir?

737
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,912
Haul your ass around the corner
to B&B Guns...

738
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,986
and grab as many semiautomatic weapons
as you can find.

739
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,486
Yes, sir.

740
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,422
They're still shooting at us.

741
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,302
Larry, get in the car.!
In the car.!

742
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,073
Stick to the plan.
You drive, I cover.

743
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,143
Kill the cops.

744
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,946
..just continue
to pummel the officers.

745
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,004
..just continue
to pummel the officers.

746
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:40,742
- They fiire-- It achieves
no effect at all.
- Officers, good morning.

747
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,809
- I need guns. We got a situation.
- You're tellin' me.

748
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:48,049
We need some assault rifles,
some semiautomatics.
What've you got?

749
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:52,116
We don't carry AKs, but, uh,
we got America's answer.

750
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,664
It's the AR-1 5.
It'll get the job done.

751
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,392
You got your CAR-1 5.
It's used by the U.S. military.

752
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,365
If you really want
something special...

753
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,927
that's the Remington 7 00,
bolt action.

754
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,973
It's the best sniper rifle made.

755
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,305
I can't believe they
let people just buy these.

756
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,879
You got proper I.D., good credit,
wait 1 0 days for a background check--

757
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,971
We need all this.
All of them.

758
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:16,984
- Okay. Hey,John, give me a hand.
- Okay.

759
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,020
Here you go.

760
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:22,386
- We need ammo.
- Okay, sir.

761
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,789
- Get these guys some ammo.
- I'll get it.

762
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:40,965
They're here.

763
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,046
Command post, this is 43-David.
We are at the scene.

764
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:55,055
Let's go.

765
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,286
Yes,Jim, unconfirmed reports now
have a possible third...

766
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,097
and maybe even a fourth suspect
in the bank.

767
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:01,995
and maybe even a fourth suspect
in the bank.

768
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,364
jay, I want you to grab
that armored car.

769
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,839
- We're going to use that
as our rescue vehicle.
- You got it.

770
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,876
L.T., what's the position
of your suspects?

771
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,275
We have two suspects
heading eastbound on Archwood.

772
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,749
We have a report of a possible
third suspect inside the bank
holding hostages.

773
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,911
- Shots have been fired.
- Okay, guys, we got
an active shooter in the bank.

774
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,251
We're gonna make an entry.
Let's go.

775
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:41,231
- Who's gonna pay for all this?
- Charge it to Mayor Riordan.

776
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,173
Suspects are leaving
the bank building.

777
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,300
They continue to fire
into police officers.

778
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:52,847
8-L-1 0. Suspects are
attempting to go mobile.

779
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,721
That's Archwood Street that
you see he's pulling out on.
He's going east on Archwood.

780
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:04,182
Get out of the way!

781
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,338
Police! Open up!

782
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,640
Open up.!

783
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,544
They're gone.
It's just us in here.

784
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:34,214
- They're gone.
- Bank's clear. Stay in the vault!

785
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,799
All right. Come on.

786
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,368
1 5-L-1 0, officer advised.

787
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,810
You've got a clear shot
at the suspect...

788
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:03,010
eastbound on Archwood,
from behind the supermarket.

789
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,468
Larry! Get in the car!

790
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,865
Get in the car!

791
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,742
Come on!

792
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,212
It's gotten strange.
They've slowed to an almost crawl...

793
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,840
but the police seem helpless
to stop them.

794
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,249
But now they're moving a little quicker.
They're separating.

795
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,844
I need officers on all four corners
on Archwood.

796
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:17,016
I want you to extend that perimeter
four blocks in all directions.

797
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:31,633
We've got a number two suspect
driving the white vehicle
headed east on Archwood.

798
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,733
We've got number one suspect on foot.
Number one is behind a long trailer rig.

799
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,783
Whew!

800
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,597
- Come on.

801
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,702
Come on. Come on.

802
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,902
Come on!

803
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,087
His gun is dropped.!
Go to the back side.!

804
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,555
Hey,you kids.! Get back inside.!
I'm a policeman.!

805
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,994
Go back in your house!
Get in there!

806
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:42,499
Oh, my God.! One of the gunmen
has just been shot. He's down.!

807
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:46,005
He's down. Officers are moving in.
He's not moving.

808
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:51,845
Vehicle is moving very slowly.
He's trying to escape.

809
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:01,218
Looks like he might be trying
to commandeer another car.

810
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,626
Larry.! No.!

811
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,466
I told you, get in the car!

812
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,165
- I told you.

813
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:25,838
There are cars coming the other way.
There is no police presence
down on Archwood, mind you.

814
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,475
- This is a residential area.

815
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:33,521
Looks like maybe he's trying
to force someone to stop,
but cars are going around him.

816
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,147
I don't know if these people
know what's going on.
They're very lucky.

817
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,358
You can't go through.
You can't go through.

818
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,364
Hey! Hey, pops!
Let me borrow your ride for 1 0 bucks?

819
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,458
- No, no. I can't.
- Ten bucks.

820
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,594
Look, look.
Here's 1 0 bucks for you.

821
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,603
All right? All right?

822
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,347
- Block the street, damn it!

823
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,497
Okay, he's fiiring.
Hejust shot through his own window.

824
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,866
The victim is running down the street.
He looks like he's okay.

825
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,168
Keys are here.

826
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,942
Well, it looks like the gunman's
reached into his car.

827
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,415
What,you want a piece of this?

828
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:52,300
You think you're gonna get me?
I'm the man. I'm the man here.

829
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:02,003
He's stopped.
Maybe he's stuck or something.

830
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:06,873
- Come on. Come on!

831
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,349
The guy who's got the initiative,
that's the guy who's calling the shots.

832
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:13,717
That's the guy who decides where
and when it's gonna happen,
how it's gonna go down.

833
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:17,223
And that can't be the bad guy.
That's gotta be you.

834
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:19,794
- Oh, shit.

835
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:23,529
Suspect!

836
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:37,606
just unbelievable.
Shots are fiiring everywhere.

837
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:41,945
Looks like SWAT's on scene
and shooting from point-blank range.

838
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,552
Watch your crossfire!

839
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:04,937
- Malfunction!
- I got you covered!

840
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,137
That way!

841
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,055
Clear! Go!

842
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,500
I'm out of ammo!

843
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,184
Are you gonna hide down there?

844
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,616
He's down. Okay, he's down.

845
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,417
SWATofficers are moving in
and they're on him.

846
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,561
Stay down.! Do not move.!

847
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:37,058
Hands! I wanna see hands!

848
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,258
When I saw that black mask...

849
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:43,805
I thought to myself,
""Here we go.''

850
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:47,535
But,you know, those are moments
when your training kicks in.

851
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,543
Do you get scared? Yeah.

852
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:51,943
You stay scared?
Better not.

853
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,407
It looks like it's over.
I think this nightmare is finally over.

854
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,782
Check the truck!

855
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,515
Get down!

856
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,561
- Hands!

857
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:19,197
1 5-L-1 0. Code four, guys.
Code four. It's all over.

858
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:26,714
- Ah, shoot!

859
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,247
All units in vicinity, all units...

860
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,947
just be advised
code three is no longer.

861
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:23,303
We generally are supposed
to have the firepower.

862
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,533
They had the firepower that day.
We had the willpower.

863
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:30,838
But you know what?
I'll take the willpower
over the firepower any day.

864
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,643
308. Holes complete.

865
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:43,052
Looks like a war zone.

866
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,496
You're going to be okay, partner.

867
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,115
When you think about it,
the kind of fiirepower
we were up against...

868
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,156
that we were outgunned--

869
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,556
People talk about being lucky,
where you're lucky...

870
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,560
that the bullet went in and out,
or you're lucky this.

871
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:24,223
Well, my grandad said,
""Luck is preparation meets opportunity.''

872
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:28,701
You've prepared and
you get the opportunity
and then you can be lucky.

873
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:31,034
And I was lucky.
A lot of us were lucky.

874
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,403
We were lucky that that day,
when you think about it...

875
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,635
the only two guys
that got killed...

876
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,678
were the suspects,
were the bad guys.

877
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:40,373
That wasn't a miracle.
That's a series of miracles.

878
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:42,416
Come on.

879
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,720
- Hey, there, look who I found.

880
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:56,559
- Hey!
- You hanging in there?

881
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:06,502
- Here, partner.
- Hey, thanks, Bobby.

882
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,085
Aw, sir.

883
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,416
They got you good.

884
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,890
Hey, I know a buddy in East LA
that can fix that air bag.

885
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:27,393
Does this mean
we're closed tomorrow?

886
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,726
No.

887
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:32,698
It's funny how fast everything
returns to a state of normalcy.

888
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:37,170
In fact, the very next day,
there was a line of customers
outside the bank...

889
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:41,402
and one of the customers
was complaining how the bank
didn't open on time.

890
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,104
Hey, life goes on, I guess.

891
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:50,215
It's kind of weird,
the way it happened.

892
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,879
The morale in the LAPD
was at an all-time low.

893
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:56,820
The public was all over us...

894
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,053
and then, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, this happened.

895
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:03,563
After that, even the media
were calling us heroes.

896
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:07,465
Nobody becomes a cop
because they want to be loved.

897
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,833
They become a cop
because they love the job.

898
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:16,172
But every once in a while,
you get to put away some bad guys.

899
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:20,476
And on that day,
in 44 minutes of...

900
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,549
sheer terror...

901
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:26,109
not a single officer ran away.

902
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,849
And everybody did their job,
and I think that means something.

903
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:35,624
And in 44 minutes
of sheer terror...

904
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,723
there wasn't a single officer
that ran away.

905
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,601
Not a single one.

906
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,470
I think that means something.

907
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,874
- That's our out. Good?

908
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,708
- Very good.
- Great.

909
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,475
I think we should
do that over there.

910
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,052
On Friday, February 28, 1 997...

911
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,985
the Los Angeles
Police Department...

912
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:04,547
experienced a day of terror
and remarkable heroism.

913
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,786
The North Hollywood bank shoot-out
will long be remembered...

914
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,796
as one of the country's most shocking
displays of criminal behavior...

915
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:14,130
and an outstanding example of
professional heroic law enforcement.

916
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:45,456
Yesterday's true heroes
were the members of the
Los Angeles Police Department.

917
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:52,103
One thing
agreed on was the bravery
shown by the police department.

918
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:55,904
Police officers tell me they're
just overwhelmed by the amount
of support they've received.

919
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,979
Now the officers are
standing by this community...

920
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,072
doing their best to support
the community as they try
to move on with their lives.

921
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:05,550
My dad works
in North Hollywood. Thanks.

922
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:15,354
It's nothing
short of miraculous
that no one was killed.

923
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:18,728
In fact, what you're
talking about here is--
It's multiple miracles.

924
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:36,049
For actions above and beyond
the call of duty...

925
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,585
seventeen LAPD officers
were honored today...

926
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,748
for their heroics during the 1 997
North Hollywood bank shoot-out.

927
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,025
Yesterday's true heroes, of course...

928
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,027
the Los Angeles police officers...

929
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,223
without bulletproof vests,
without the same fiirepower...

930
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,700
courageously tracked down and stopped
the two heavily armed gunmen.

931
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,703
I'd like to personally thank
Commander Weller...

932
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,137
and the North Hollywood police station.

933
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,038
The heroic behavior
of many officers yesterday...

934
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,441
- has triggered
an outpouring of support.
- Thank you for what you did.

935
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,571
Some baked cakes.
Others brought flowers.

936
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:10,845
Many sent cards,yet others--

937
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:15,150
Thank you for what you did,
all of you officers.

938
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,190
We're 3 2 years
living in North Hollywood...

939
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,988
and we really appreciate
everything that you've done.
