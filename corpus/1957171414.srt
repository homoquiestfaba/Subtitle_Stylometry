1
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
Hey, you guys.

2
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,400
This cave wasn't on the map
stolen from the museum
in Cairo.

3
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
We're here three weeks,
Rachel, and now
you tell us this?

4
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
What difference
does it make?

5
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
English, Kareem.

6
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
How do you know
there are two maps?

7
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Professor Abrams told me.

8
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Well, now it makes sense.

9
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Right.

10
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Hey, you guys.
I think I found something.

11
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
That's it.
That's it!

12
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
Gentle.

13
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
David,
further that way.

14
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
No, no, please.
Let's see how big it is.

15
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
That's it.

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Be careful.

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Straight.

18
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
Up to the side.
Ready?

19
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
Good.
Go.

20
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Nice work, gentlemen.

22
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,600
No, no, no, please. Don't...

23
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
With these,
the future can be told.

24
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
You bastard.

25
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No!

26
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let me go.
Please, help me!

27
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
No. Let me go!

28
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
No. Let me go!

29
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Hello?

30
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,800
Follow my instructions
on the DVD.

31
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
If you deviate
from any of the instructions,

32
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,400
you'll never see
your daughter alive again.

33
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
No. Let me go!

34
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I want $2 million
in 50s and 100s.

35
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
No consecutive serial bills.
No!

36
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,000
No new bills.
No marked bills.

37
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,400
Do not involve the police
or your daughter will die.

38
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
Stop it!

39
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,600
Mommy, I'm scared.

40
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
You'll never
see your daughter alive.

41
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm scared.

42
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,400
You'll never
see your daughter alive.

43
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm sorry I was too late.

44
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Did you have
to throw him out of
the window, Shep?

45
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
I needed some air.

46
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Could have made a call
before you pulled a Die Hard.

47
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Your phone was busy, Moore.

48
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Maybe you should
spring for an extra line.

49
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Hey, you were a cop
for 25 and change.

50
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
You know the routine.

51
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,000
The family hired me
to find the girl, Parks,
after they lost faith in you.

52
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, yeah.
And you found her,
all right.

53
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Look, Shep, I know
you've had a rough day

54
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
and I know how
you take it personal

55
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
when things don't go
the way you planned.

56
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
So why don't you go home,
have a couple of cool ones,

57
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
get it behind you, okay?

58
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
All right, partner.

59
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
Hey, you know, Shepherd,
we had these guys as suspects

60
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
in two other kidnap
for ransom cases.

61
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Does that surprise you?

62
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
No. What surprises me,
Parks,

63
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,200
is that you didn't
connect these guys
to the girl's kidnapping.

64
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I did.

65
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Hey, you know...
Where you going?

66
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm not finished
with you yet, pal.

67
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
You aren't, but I am.
I got a family to notify.

68
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Last boarding call
for Flight 137,

69
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
service to Las Vegas.

70
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,000
All ticketed passengers
of Flight 137 to Las Vegas...

71
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Please do not leave
any unattended baggage
in the airport terminal.

72
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
All unattended baggage
should be...

73
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm looking for a guy
by the name of Zalman.

74
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Zalman. Doesn't ring a bell?
Are you sure?

75
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,400
Came here like
in the mid '40s.
He's a cutter.

76
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Shalom, Rabbi.
Do you have a minute?

77
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Of course.
How can I help you?

78
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm in town from New York
for a couple of days

79
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
and I'm trying
to locate a great uncle.

80
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,800
He immigrated to this area
around 1947, '48.

81
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
He survived Auschwitz.

82
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
What's his surname?

83
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Zalman, with a "Z."

84
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Zalman. No.

85
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
What kind of work did he do?

86
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,200
Jewelry business.
He was a cutter.

87
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,200
The only cutter
I know of that age
is Isaac Teller.

88
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Isaac Teller.

89
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Not too bad

90
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
Not too good

91
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,600
Just medium

92
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
Okay.

93
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Hello? Isaac?

94
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
Hello, Isaac.
It's me.

95
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
I'm in here.

96
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Where are you?
I'm here.

97
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We're gonna be late
for work.

98
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Have you taken your meds?

99
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,600
Elizabeth, you're the best.
But why do you have to...

100
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Just get dressed already.
We're gonna be late.

101
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Why are you
such a nudge?

102
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,400
I've got three estates
to look at this morning.

103
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm gonna need you
to appraise a few stones
for me.

104
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Isaac, are you
paying attention? Hello?

105
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Uh-huh.

106
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,400
Yeah, of course.
Three estates.

107
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Elizabeth, tonight,
after we close the shop,

108
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
how about you and I
go out for dinner, huh?

109
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
My treat.

110
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Schachter?

111
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
And you are?

112
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Vladimir Yukov.

113
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,600
What can I do for you,
Mr. Yukov?

114
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
I need to have
some jewelry appraised.

115
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
Antique diamonds,
some rare colors.

116
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
Mostly large, uncut stones.

117
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I'm told there's a cutter
who is in his 80s,

118
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
who's supposed
to be the best.

119
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
That could only
be Isaac Teller.

120
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Isaac Teller?

121
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,400
Yeah, he's a close friend.

122
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Do you know how
I can reach him?

123
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,200
He has a jewelry store
across town
with his niece, Elizabeth.

124
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,200
You wouldn't have
his address, would you?

125
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Sure.

126
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,000
It's 137 West Broadway.

127
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Thank you, Mr. Schachter.

128
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Mmm, not at all.

129
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Where are we going?

130
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,400
If you want to, let's walk.
Let's go, then.

131
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
If you want to go
to the art museum,

132
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,000
we'll go there.
We'll have a nice time.

133
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
What's going on?
You've hardly said
a word to me tonight.

134
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,400
I've done some reflecting
these last few days.

135
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
More reflecting than usual?

136
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Elizabeth, years ago,
before your parents
passed away,

137
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,400
I promised them
I'd always take care of you.

138
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
You're the last
of our family.

139
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Don't start talking
about dying. I asked...

140
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,200
All right, shush,
shush, dear.

141
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,400
Elizabeth,
you've really become
a very good cutter.

142
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,400
This is my legacy to you.

143
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,400
It's a diagram of a cut
I designed
when I was in Auschwitz.

144
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,600
It's called
the Tolkowsky Modification.

145
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
Once you perfect it,

146
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
it will make you
a great cutter.

147
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Ruth Mueller's rosary
is tomorrow afternoon.

148
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,200
Do you feel like going?

149
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,800
Ay, for a child to die
before a parent, a tragedy.

150
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm just not up to it.

151
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Please give the family
my respects.

152
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
The family hired me
to find the girl, Parks.

153
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
Find the girl, Parks.

154
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,800
And you found her,
all right.

155
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
Found her, all right.

156
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry I was too late.

157
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm sorry I was too late.

158
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Too late.

159
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
The family won't accept
the money, Shep.

160
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,200
I really appreciate it,
Monsignor,
but I didn't earn it.

161
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,400
But you found Ruth.
You gave them
a chance to bury her.

162
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Then start a scholarship
in her name,
but I can't take it.

163
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I understand.
Good to see you again, Shep.

164
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Mrs. Mueller,
I'm so sorry.

165
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,800
Thank you. Thank you.

166
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,600
Listen.
Just pick up the niece

167
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
and bring her
to the warehouse.

168
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Yes?

169
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Vladimir Yukov.

170
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,800
Moshe Schachter has given me
the name of Isaac Teller.

171
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,600
Moshe Schachter.

172
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Yes. Come in, please.

173
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh, thank you.

174
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
Mr. Schachter tells me
you're a great cutter.

175
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,600
I only do special jobs.

176
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Most of the cutting
is done by my niece,
Elizabeth.

177
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,400
The eyes, the hands,
they are not
what they once were.

178
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
You understand.

179
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,400
But you are available
to consult?

180
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Perhaps.

181
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,800
I have two stones
consigned to me
for cutting.

182
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,400
A white and a red.

183
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,800
A man could live 10 lifetimes
without ever setting eyes
on stones like these.

184
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,600
Sometimes I feel
I have lived that long.

185
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,400
Have you ever seen two stones

186
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,000
each more than 500 karats
in the rough?

187
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
Never.

188
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
This I would like to see.

189
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,800
Where do you have them?

190
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,400
Close by and very secure.

191
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Help!

192
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's our lucky day.

193
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,400
Good job, bud. He's gone.

194
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Go! Go!

195
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Son of a bitch.

196
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm gonna kill you!

197
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Hey, lady, wait.

198
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Police!

199
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
Lose the .45, pal.

200
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Relax. I'm the good guy.

201
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,200
Move away from the stiff.
Do it slow.

202
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
You on the ground,
don't move!

203
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Down! Don't move!

204
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Now he was the bad guy.

205
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Headquarters tells us
that our man is a freelancer,

206
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
speaks foreign languages
fluently,

207
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,600
and has used
13 different names
that we know of.

208
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,800
As you can see
by these photographs here,

209
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,600
he's also
a master of disguises.

210
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,800
According to Interpol,
our suspect murdered
a team of five archeologists

211
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,600
at an excavation site
here in the Sinai Desert.

212
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,200
For this.
The Breastplate of Aaron.

213
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,800
The Breastplate of Aaron
is one of Israel's

214
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
most sacred
religious artifacts

215
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,800
and it may now
be here in Spokane.

216
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,400
If we find our man,
we may just
find this artifact.

217
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Now I don't have to tell you,
he's armed and dangerous,

218
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
so watch your backs.

219
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Mr. Teller, please.

220
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,400
May I?

221
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Certainly.

222
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Oh,

223
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,800
these are the most
magnificent stones
I've ever seen.

224
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,000
So, Mr. Teller,
are you available to consult?

225
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You have to ask?

226
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What, uh, design
do you have in mind?

227
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I want them cut
into matching brilliants.

228
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Five have been considered.

229
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,400
The King variation,
the briolette.

230
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,000
The trilliant,
the navette variation.

231
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
What is the fifth cut?

232
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,800
Eighty-five facets,
first designed
by Marcel Tolkowsky

233
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,400
as a variation
of his original brilliant.

234
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
And then in Auschwitz,

235
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,000
you changed it, perfected it.

236
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,400
The Tolkowsky Modification.

237
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,800
Who are you?

238
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
Isaac?

239
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Isaac, you here?

240
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,800
This is
my legacy to you.

241
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
No!

242
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,200
As I told your buddies
behind the mirror,

243
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
I don't know the girl.

244
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Let me get this straight.

245
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,200
You see a girl get snatched,
you chase the car,

246
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,000
you take out two thugs,
and that's your story,
Shepherd?

247
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well, not exactly, Parks.

248
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
What do you mean?

249
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,800
Well, I took out one thug
and your buddies
took out one thug.

250
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,200
Oh, boy.

251
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
You just think
you're real funny, don't you?

252
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
About as funny
as your questions are stupid.

253
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,200
All right,
both of you,
knock it off.

254
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,800
Hi, you guys.
Hey, wait. What the hell
you doing in here?

255
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
Hey, do you mind
if I take my client
to breakfast,

256
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
'cause I'm sure
you haven't fed him yet.

257
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Counselor,
who the hell called you?

258
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
Heard on my
police scanner.

259
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Nice suit, Moore.
Makes you look taller.

260
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Say, where do you
keep the batteries
for that shirt, Eddie?

261
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,200
You're a scream.

262
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,400
I'm finally
taking a vacation.

263
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,400
Where you going?

264
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,400
Paradise, baby.

265
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
Where they bury pigs
in a volcano.

266
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,600
Now, Shep,
think you can
do me a favor?

267
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,000
Stay out of trouble,
stop killing people,
just till I get back.

268
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
I'll give it a shot.

269
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,400
You know, the press is gonna
be staking your place out
again after this one.

270
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah, you're right.

271
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
No parties.

272
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Hey, Shep.
Hey, Alena.

273
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,200
Oh, um, Eddie told me
about a no-name woman
calling him

274
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
about me being sweated
in major crimes.

275
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Any idea who that would be?

276
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
This, uh, this no-name female,
what did she sound like,
Counselor?

277
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Gypsy. Yup.

278
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,400
Gypsy-Ukrainian,
if I had to guess.

279
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
Gypsy-Ukrainian.

280
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Can't imagine
who that would be.

281
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
Excuse me.

282
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Don't be strangers, boys.

283
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,400
If I could fight,
I would smack you.

284
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,000
You should have married her.

285
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,600
Been there, done that, Eddie.

286
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Now am I gonna have a problem
with my PI license
over this?

287
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,400
Shep, come on.
I'll take care of it
before I leave.

288
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,200
You're a good buddy
and a good lawyer.

289
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
I know. I'm the best.

290
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Ah, I wouldn't go that far.

291
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,200
Miss Teller?

292
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm Lieutenant Moore
with the Spokane PD.

293
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,000
This is Special Agent Parks
with the FBI.

294
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,600
Where were you last night?

295
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Can never find a cop
when you need one.

296
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,200
About last night,
you left the scene
of a double homicide

297
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,200
and then waited 12 hours
before coming in to report
your uncle Isaac missing.

298
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,000
Why the delay?

299
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,800
I left because I had no idea
who was shooting at whom
or why.

300
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
So why wait 12 hours?

301
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,600
I was hoping my uncle
might come home.

302
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,400
So, what about my diamonds?

303
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,800
Well, we don't mean
to be presumptuous.

304
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Oh, go ahead,
be presumptuous.

305
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,200
Some investigators
might suspect that
you set this whole thing up

306
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,200
and it went down all wrong.

307
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,000
What about the guy
in the van?

308
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,200
Did you question him?

309
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,400
You mean John Shepherd,
the man that saved your life.

310
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,600
And the answer is,
yes, we did.

311
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
Okay, then.

312
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Excuse me.

313
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Miss Teller,
three years ago,
you stabbed a man

314
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
that tried to
rob your uncle.

315
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,800
And tried to rape me,
and you saw the verdict.

316
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Justifiable homicide.

317
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,200
Are you suggesting
that I set up the robbery,
too?

318
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Look, I'm not missing.
My uncle is missing,

319
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,600
so, if you'll excuse me,
I have to plan another crime.

320
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
She's dirty.

321
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,200
Why aren't you working,
cutter?

322
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Listen to me,
whoever you are,

323
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
I'm not going to
do this anymore.

324
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
You want to play? We'll play.

325
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Look, I survived four years
in Auschwitz.

326
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,200
You cannot threaten me.

327
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Elizabeth.

328
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
What have you
done with Elizabeth?

329
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,400
Cut the stones, old man,
or I'll bring Elizabeth to you

330
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
one piece at a time.

331
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,800
This is
my legacy to you.

332
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,400
It's a diagram of a cut
I designed
when I was in Auschwitz.

333
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,200
It's called
the Tolkowsky Modification.

334
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
It will make you
a great cutter.

335
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,600
Come in. Door's open.

336
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
I want my diamonds,
Mr. Shepherd.

337
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
What diamonds?

338
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,200
The ones you stole
in the park.

339
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,600
Stole? From who?
From me.

340
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,400
Okay, describe the diamonds.

341
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
They were rough, uncut.

342
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
I didn't get around
to counting them.

343
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
Let me get this straight.

344
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You're looking for diamonds
that you can't describe

345
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and you don't know
how many of them there are,

346
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
and you want me to believe
they're yours.

347
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh, you better believe
they're mine, and you better
give them to me now.

348
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay, okay.
I won't kid anymore.
Here.

349
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
And by the way,
there's 13 of them,
if you want to count them.

350
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Thanks.

351
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,200
You're welcome.

352
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,600
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Miss, um...

353
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
Liz Teller.

354
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,800
And, yes, there is.

355
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I've been told
you're the best.
It's about a missing person.

356
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Who's missing?

357
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,600
My uncle, Isaac Teller.

358
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,800
How long has he been gone?

359
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
Since last night.

360
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,800
Wait. Last night?
How do you know
he's really missing?

361
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,600
Maybe he's with his girlfriend
having a wild...

362
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,400
He's over 80 years old,
and he doesn't
have a girlfriend.

363
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I've checked with his friends.
No one's seen him.

364
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,400
Look, Miss Teller,
when most people hire me
to find someone,

365
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
it's because
the cops have struck out,
and I'm their last resort.

366
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,200
I just want you to find him.

367
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
How much?

368
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,400
Well, if I don't find him,
nothing.

369
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
But if I do find him...

370
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
$20,000 cash.

371
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Excuse me?

372
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
Oh, it's an expression
in the diamond business

373
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,800
meaning luck and blessing
when you make a deal
on a handshake.

374
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
Okay, deal.

375
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
Well, who was the last
to see him?

376
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
I know he had a visitor.

377
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,800
How do you know that?

378
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Because there were two glasses
on his living room table.

379
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Did you touch these?
Uh-uh.

380
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Well, maybe you're
in the wrong business.

381
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
What's that all about?

382
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,200
What's the problem?
Hey, I'm sorry
to bother you today, sir,

383
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,000
but I think
you might have a problem
with your fuse box.

384
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
Okay, follow me.

385
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
Thank you.

386
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Am I the only one?

387
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
No, actually,
the whole building's down.

388
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,000
I've been working
on the stinking basement
for the last two hours.

389
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
Ma'am.

390
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
There it is.

391
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,800
All righty. Right to it.

392
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
Shepherd!

393
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,800
Come on!

394
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,000
Come on!

395
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,400
This table wasn't broken
when I was here.

396
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,000
Well, I'm sure your uncle
didn't do that.

397
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,800
So someone came back here
for the tea glass
with his print on it.

398
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,200
And it looks like
he got a little bit upset
when he didn't find it.

399
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,600
Well, I have to assume
your uncle was kidnapped.

400
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,800
Forget the assumption.
He was kidnapped.

401
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Who would do such a thing
to such a sweet man?

402
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,200
This your uncle?
Yes.

403
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,600
Can I borrow it?
Mmm-hmm.

404
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,200
Why him?
What's his background?

405
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,800
He was born in Poland,
but he didn't get out
before the Nazis.

406
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,000
Besides my parents,
who brought him here
after the war,

407
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,000
no one else in the family
survived the Holocaust.

408
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,600
How'd you get into
the jewelry business?

409
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Family. Five generations.

410
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
Who trained you?

411
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,800
After my parents passed away,

412
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,600
Isaac sent me to Antwerp
to train with the masters.

413
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,000
And so now I do
all the cutting,

414
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200
and he does
the important appraisals.

415
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,600
Would you like some tea?

416
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,800
Yeah, sure.

417
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
Why no ransom demand?

418
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,600
You tell me.

419
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,600
Shepherd?

420
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,600
Shepherd!

421
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,800
Don't say a word.
He'll be all right.

422
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,000
Shepherd.

423
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,000
Cut the stones,
old man,

424
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,400
or I'll bring
Elizabeth to you

425
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
one piece at a time.

426
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,000
One piece at a time.

427
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,400
One piece at a time.
One piece at a time.

428
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Whoa, what a place.
Who lives here?

429
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,000
My lawyer, Eddie.

430
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,200
How'd you guys meet?

431
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, we met on a serial
murder investigation.

432
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,200
Eddie had a female client
that went missing,

433
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,000
and I was the lead
investigator on the case.

434
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
I finally found the girl,
well, what was left of her.

435
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,000
And soon after that,
I retired from the force.

436
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,800
And then you became a PI?

437
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Yeah.

438
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,200
Liz, don't answer the phone
unless you hear my voice.

439
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,200
Well, well, wait a minute.

440
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,800
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

441
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
You're not leaving me here.

442
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Look, I'll only be gone
for a little while, okay?

443
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,000
And don't open the door
unless you know it's me.

444
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,400
Okay, now, that is
Isaac Teller's fingerprint.

445
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,000
What about the other print?

446
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
See, that's where
it gets interesting.

447
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,000
He's a chameleon,
a man of many faces.

448
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Uh, that is not good.

449
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,200
Usually means
there's a red flag
in the system.

450
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,000
Are you sure
about where you got
this fingerprint?

451
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,400
Have I ever
lied to you, Moore?

452
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
Not in the last 24 hours.

453
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,400
I think the last person
who spoke to Isaac
was Moshe Schachter.

454
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,000
Who's he?

455
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,000
He's a jeweler,
a friend of Isaac's.

456
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Sometimes they go in
together on a stone,

457
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
shop it around,
and split the profits.

458
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,200
Well, let's go see him.

459
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,400
Mr. Schachter?

460
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,200
Mr. Schachter?

461
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
It's Liz Teller. Hello?

462
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Is he...

463
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah.

464
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That's the guy
from Isaac's basement.

465
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,000
Shepherd!

466
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,000
Hebrew.

467
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,200
What?

468
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
So what were
you doin' here?

469
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,400
I think Schachter
was the last one
to see Isaac Teller.

470
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
I wanted to ask him
a few questions.

471
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,600
Did you know the guy
that got his throat
slashed from ear to ear?

472
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,000
No, you?

473
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,800
We're runnin' him.

474
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,000
Speaking of which,
you are running
out of lives, Shep.

475
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah, but who's counting?

476
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,200
Man, you look
like a road map.

477
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,200
His rental car
contract comes back
Anthony Maylam of Brussels.

478
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,200
His prints, however,
come back as someone else.

479
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,400
Look, people,
sitting in this room,

480
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,200
we've got about half
the alphabet agencies.

481
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
So let me ask this
question a different way.

482
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,600
Who the heck is
this Anthony Maylam?

483
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,400
Let's take it outside.

484
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Yeah?

485
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,600
I know a little bit
about this guy,
but not much.

486
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,200
You kept this from me?

487
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,600
I mean, what the hell?

488
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
We're partners on
a joint task force.

489
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Partners? Partners my ass.

490
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,600
This is my show,
my task force.

491
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,000
You work for me, understand?

492
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,400
Who is he, Parks?

493
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
And what's he doing
in Spokane?

494
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,600
He's tracking
the breastplate.

495
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,000
For?

496
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Interpol.

497
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,600
Interpol doesn't
work in the States.

498
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
That's what DC's
trying to figure out.

499
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,000
Well, is there anybody else
working under the radar?

500
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,000
Not that I'm aware of.

501
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,600
Something tells me
this isn't just
about the breastplate

502
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,000
or somebody who
likes to change his face

503
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and kill people,
or am I wrong,
Agent Parks?

504
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,600
Be careful.

505
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,600
The guy
at Moshe Schachter's,

506
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,600
he told you something
before he died.

507
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,400
Yeah, but it didn't
make sense.

508
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,800
What did he say?

509
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,200
Well, first he said, "Hebrew"
and then something like,
"Ocean mesh pot."

510
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,000
Ocean mesh pot?

511
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,600
The words are Hoshen mishpat
from the ancient Hebrew.

512
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,800
The literal
translation into English is
"Breastplate of Judgment."

513
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,200
Oh, from the Old Testament,
book of Exodus.

514
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
That's right.

515
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,200
I'm very impressed.
You know what? I got an idea.

516
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,000
If you hold on a second,
I have something

517
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,600
very interesting
for you to look at.

518
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,400
Just hold on a second.

519
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,200
Got just what
I was looking for.

520
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,200
Now, it was worn first
by the High Priest Aaron,

521
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,000
older brother of Moses.

522
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So it came to be known
as Aaron's breastplate.

523
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,600
After the death of Aaron,
the breastplate
was passed down

524
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,600
through the tribe of priests,
the tribe of Levi.

525
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,600
Okay, here it is.

526
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,800
Now, if you can see,

527
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,200
each of the stones
in the breastplate

528
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,600
represented one of
the tribes of Israel.

529
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,400
The priest was to keep
their interest in his heart

530
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,400
when making decisions
on their behalf.

531
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,600
What do you think,
Dr. Joseph?

532
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,400
Dr. Joseph?

533
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
What do you think?

534
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,400
Yeah. Yeah, it's...

535
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
First, the stones,

536
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
they're typical of the time.
It's that...

537
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,200
The lapis lazuli, the topaz.

538
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,400
The turquoise is...

539
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,600
The Phoenician engravings,
Dr. Joseph.
Hmm?

540
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,800
The Phoenician engraving.

541
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,200
The Phoenician
engraving, yeah.

542
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
They're... They're
consistent with, uh,

543
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,400
the script in
the region at the time.

544
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
And the weave and color?

545
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,600
Definitely
pre-Mosaic Egyptian.

546
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,400
It's exactly as described
in Exodus, Chapter 28.

547
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,800
It's my, uh,
preliminary judgment

548
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,400
and it might be careless,

549
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,600
but, uh, Heschel,
this breastplate is authentic.

550
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,400
What are those two stones
in the high priest's
hands, Professor?

551
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,800
Uh, Urim and the Thummim.

552
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,200
Now I'm impressed.

553
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,000
And the words
translate into English
as light and perfection.

554
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,800
Now, the stones,
the Urim and Thummim,
were kept in the pouch

555
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,400
behind the breastplate.

556
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,800
Did they have a purpose?

557
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,400
On important matters,
the high priest
would remove the stones

558
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
and ask a question of God.

559
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,400
He would then roll
the stones like dice.

560
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,400
One stone symbolized
yes and the other no.

561
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,400
Now from the way
the stones came to rest

562
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,600
or the way
they cast their light,

563
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,200
the priest was able
to determine God's answers
to his questions.

564
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,400
So that's how
God spoke to them.

565
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,200
These were ancient peoples,
superstitious.

566
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,800
They believed they had
a covenant with God.

567
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,800
Now, if it proves to be
Aaron's breastplate,

568
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,400
it was stolen
from the excavation
at Sinai Desert, right?

569
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Yeah.

570
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,400
Forgive me,
but I must ask...

571
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,600
How the breastplate came
into my possession,
Dr. Joseph,

572
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,200
will come out in due time.

573
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,800
But you will have
the honor of returning it

574
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,800
to the Israel Museum
in Jerusalem.

575
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,800
Oh, thank you so much.

576
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,200
This is...

577
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,800
This is unbelievable.

578
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,000
We can go now.

579
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,400
Morning, Jim.

580
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,800
Alena,
you got a minute?

581
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,600
Yeah, sure.

582
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,200
Your, uh, friend Shepherd
is ruining our investigation.

583
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,800
Yeah, well,
he does that sometimes.

584
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah, well,
if he keeps doing that,

585
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
he's gonna find himself
in a world of hurt.

586
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm pretty sure Shep
can take care of himself.

587
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,600
I'm not too concerned
with Shepherd.

588
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,400
I'm more concerned
with the people
that he gets close to.

589
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
There aren't that many.

590
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
But if he's such
a big problem for you,

591
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
why don't you just
pick up the phone
and call him?

592
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,000
How long you been
on the task force?

593
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,600
Nine months.
Where is this going?

594
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,000
You like it here?

595
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,400
You want to keep working here?
Maybe move up?

596
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,800
Or you want to go back
to sex crimes

597
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,400
and dope at
the end of your year?

598
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,000
You know, I, uh, I don't
like being threatened.

599
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Hey, I'm not threatening you.

600
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,400
Just be smart, Alena.

601
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Have a heart-to-heart
with your boy.

602
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
Or?

603
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,000
He's a shit magnet.
Fill in the blanks.

604
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Yeah, there are problems
with both stones.

605
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Are you
stalling again, cutter?

606
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,600
There's a fracture
in a non-cleavage
direction in the white,

607
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,800
and a cloud where
the star facet should be cut.

608
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,600
So what are you saying?

609
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,800
What I'm saying is
that the faceting machine
has a broken tooth gear.

610
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,800
Look, if you want
the stones cut,

611
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,000
you're going to
have to get me
a new head mechanism.

612
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,600
You better be
sure about this.

613
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,600
Okay, okay, Alena.

614
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,200
I'll see you at 7:00
in the morning.

615
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,000
What happened?

616
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,200
It slipped.

617
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,800
Did you cut yourself?

618
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,400
It's Isaac.
I'm so worried.

619
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
We'll find him. I promise.

620
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,200
Hey, how's it going?

621
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,000
Could be worse, Shep.

622
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,200
What's your excuse?

623
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,800
Fresh out of 'em.

624
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,000
Say, I want to thank you
for calling Eddie for me.

625
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Hey, what are friends for?

626
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,200
Uh, just coffee.

627
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,800
We are friends,
aren't we?

628
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,000
Look, Alena, you know
I've been through
two marriages already,

629
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,800
the last one
just two years ago.

630
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,200
Don't worry.
I didn't call you down here

631
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,600
to make you talk
about our past.

632
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,600
Then why did you
call me down here?

633
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,200
Parks is really
bent out of shape

634
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,800
about the way
you've been treating him.

635
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,200
Is that a fact?

636
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,000
That's a fact.

637
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,600
And if you don't back off,
he's gonna make
your life miserable.

638
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,200
Oh, really?

639
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,000
Did he say how
he's gonna make my life

640
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,800
more miserable
than it already is?

641
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,600
Don't take this lightly.

642
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
Do you know that
he used to be liaison

643
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,600
for Counterintelligence
at Interpol?

644
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,800
So?

645
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,600
As a favor to me, Shep,
would you back off?

646
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,600
As a favor to you, I will.

647
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Now I'll tell you
what I really
called you down here for.

648
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,200
I overheard Parks
talking to this guy,

649
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
and I heard the name
Colonel Speerman.

650
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,400
Now, they think
that this Isaac Teller,

651
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,000
maybe he's more than
just a kidnap victim.

652
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,800
Anything else?

653
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,200
I'm pretty sure I overheard
the word Holocaust.

654
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,000
Holocaust?

655
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah.

656
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,800
Holocaust.

657
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,000
Rabbi, is there anyone
in your congregation

658
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,800
who survived
the concentration camps?

659
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
Several.

660
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,200
What are you
looking for?

661
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,000
Work details.

662
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,200
I think I know someone
who might be
able to help you.

663
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,000
I'll call her for you.
Her name is Mrs. Rosen.

664
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,400
Uh, one other thing.

665
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,000
Has there been any
strangers by here

666
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
in the last few days
asking you questions?

667
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,400
Yeah. As a matter of fact,

668
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,600
a young man came by
just yesterday
looking for his great uncle.

669
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,800
Did he mention his name?

670
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,200
He said
the uncle's name was Zalman.

671
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,200
Zalman, with a "Z."

672
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,200
I'd never heard that name,
so he thanked me and left.

673
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,000
He said
the uncle's name was Zalman.

674
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,000
Zalman, with a "Z."

675
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Zalman, with a "Z."

676
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,600
Come on, let's go.

677
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
Where have you been?

678
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
Tracking down leads.

679
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
Where are we going?

680
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,400
Another lead.

681
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,200
Mrs. Rosen,
can you tell us about

682
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,800
the diamond cutters
at Auschwitz?

683
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,400
Yes, there were
several master cutters
while I was there.

684
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,400
They... They used
to cut diamonds

685
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,200
in the camp
for Adolf Hitler.

686
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,400
Did you know any
of the cutters?

687
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,000
Well, they were segregated
from the main population

688
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,200
and very heavily guarded.

689
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,800
Do you recognize this man?

690
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
It's my uncle,
Isaac Teller.

691
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,800
That's Chaim Zalman.

692
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,400
No, no, no.
It's Isaac Teller.

693
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,800
No, my dear,
that's Chaim Zalman,
one of the cutters.

694
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,800
He had
a beautiful wife, Rebecca,

695
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,000
two young boys
and a daughter.

696
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,800
The SS forced
the men to decide,

697
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
either cut diamonds

698
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
or die with their families
in the gas chamber.

699
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,800
The men cut diamonds.

700
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,200
The wives became
whores of the SS,

701
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,400
so that their
children could live.

702
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,400
And then, one day,

703
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Rebecca and the children
were taken
to the center of the camp.

704
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,000
And with Chaim watching,

705
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,200
an SS soldier,
on orders from
Colonel Speerman,

706
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
murdered Chaim's family,

707
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
there, in cold blood.

708
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,200
I never saw or heard
of Chaim Zalman again.

709
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Please, excuse me.

710
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,000
Why didn't he
tell me about this?

711
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Your uncle probably wanted
to start a new life
after Auschwitz.

712
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,400
I can't even imagine
what he went
through over there.

713
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,800
The Tolkowsky Modification.

714
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,400
What?

715
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,000
It's a unique cut
for large diamonds.

716
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,200
What would your uncle need
to cut these stones?

717
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,200
Very sophisticated
and expensive equipment.

718
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Let's start
checking out the stores.

719
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,200
Drop Heschel at the Davenport.

720
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,000
Tell him I'll meet him there.

721
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,000
Hello. May I help you?

722
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,600
I need a head mechanism
for a cutting machine.

723
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,200
A head mechanism?

724
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,800
Uh, let me check
and see if we have any.

725
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,200
Here you are. You're lucky.

726
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,000
It's the last one we have.

727
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,000
How much do I owe you?

728
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,400
It's expensive.
It's $3,400.

729
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,000
How did you want
to pay for that?

730
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,400
Cash.

731
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,600
All right,
we'll take care of that.

732
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,200
Don't you want a receipt?

733
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,600
Where to, mister?

734
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,000
The Davenport Hotel.
Step on it.

735
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,400
You mean
the Davenport on Broadway?

736
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,600
Just drive.

737
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,600
You know,
I've had people in my cab
from all over the world.

738
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,400
I'm pretty good with accents.

739
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,200
I bet I can tell
where you're from.

740
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,200
Cat got your tongue?

741
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,000
Just drive.

742
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,200
This just came in from
Bureau headquarters.

743
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,000
This is Colonel Speerman.
Appointed by Hitler

744
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,400
to oversee
the cutting of diamonds
to help finance the war.

745
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,000
The collection was known
as the Reich Stones.

746
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,800
And the most spectacular
of all of them is this.

747
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,800
400-karat blue diamond
known as the Fuhrer's Stone,

748
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,600
cut in a design called
the Tolkowsky Modification.

749
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,000
Where are these stones now?

750
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,400
Well, uh, a few of them
hit the diamond markets
just after the war

751
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
but they were cut
into smaller stones.

752
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,600
And the others are held
by private collectors

753
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,000
who may or may not
know the histories.

754
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,400
So if Isaac Teller
was kidnapped

755
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,400
to cut two large diamonds,
then what?

756
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,200
Well, he's cutting
the diamonds for a man

757
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,200
who has no intention
of selling these
in the legit market.

758
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,800
It's either black market,
or he's keeping
them for himself.

759
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,600
Either way,
our man, whoever he is,

760
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,400
is freelancing for
that man right there.

761
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,600
Col. Speerman.

762
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,200
Speerman isn't walking around
with that face anymore, is he?

763
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,000
No way.

764
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,600
Hello.

765
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,400
Hello.

766
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,400
Excuse me, ma'am.

767
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,000
Has anyone come in recently
asking for these
particular tools?

768
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,000
As a matter of fact,
there was a young man
in here earlier

769
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,600
who purchased
a head mechanism,
and paid cash for it.

770
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,800
Is that what he would need?

771
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,800
Yes.

772
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,800
Did you see
which way he went?

773
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,600
He got into a Yellow Cab.
That's all I saw.

774
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,800
Okay, thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

775
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,200
Thanks.

776
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,200
Here, you drive.

777
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,400
I'm gonna call
the Yellow Cab Company

778
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,600
and find out who
picked this guy up.

779
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,200
There he is. Wait here.

780
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,800
Hiya, Calvin.

781
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,000
Hey. Do I know you?

782
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,400
You picked up a fare
in front of the Spokane
Jewelry supply store,

783
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,600
maybe two hours ago?

784
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,600
Yeah, I remember that guy.

785
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,800
I was just trying to be nice,
and he was looking at me

786
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,600
with some crazy eyes,
like I owed him
money or somethin'.

787
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,400
Except, he didn't
care about the money.

788
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,600
Where did you take him?

789
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,000
Now you know
professional courtesy
will not allow me

790
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
to divulge that information.

791
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Well,
I tell you what, Calvin.

792
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,400
Why don't I take you down
to police headquarters

793
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,800
and you can
divulge it there.

794
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,200
How about that?

795
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
You serious?

796
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,000
Calvin, I'm as serious
as a heart attack.

797
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,800
I took him to
the Davenport Hotel.

798
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,800
Davenport Hotel.
Great, thanks a lot.

799
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,800
Do you know
what the chances are

800
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,600
of seeing this guy
coming or going?

801
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,800
We've been
sitting here for hours.

802
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,600
And he may not be even
staying in the Davenport

803
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,400
even if that's where
the cabbie dropped him.

804
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,400
Patience, Liz.

805
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,400
Hey, that's
the guy from...

806
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Yeah, our repairman.

807
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
You're getting good at this.

808
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,800
And who's the old man?

809
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,600
My guess is
someone from
your uncle's past.

810
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,200
Let's go.

811
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,000
Moore,
it's Shep.

812
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,800
We're following the suspect
east on Riverside
in a silver Town Car.

813
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,400
We're being followed.
Stop here.

814
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Go to the warehouse.

815
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,800
If they follow you,
you know what to do.

816
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,000
Go back to Eddie's
and wait for me.

817
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,400
I'll follow the Town Car.

818
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,600
I said go back to Eddie's.

819
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,800
Okay, okay.

820
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,800
Hi, this is John Shepherd.

821
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,400
I'm not in.
Just leave a message.

822
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,800
Shep, I'm not
at the apartment.

823
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
I tailed the Town Car...

824
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,000
Keep the change.

825
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,200
Where's Isaac Teller?

826
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
Or do I have to
beat it out of you?

827
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,200
Oh, that's what
I like about you.

828
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,000
That you're
worried about Isaac

829
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,200
when you should be
worried about yourself.

830
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,200
Should I take
that as a threat?

831
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
No. Your last will
and testament.

832
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,600
Drive.

833
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,200
Shep, I'm not
at the apartment.

834
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,000
I tailed the Town Car...

835
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
Shep, I'm not
at the apartment.

836
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,400
Lieutenant Moore,
Spokane PD.

837
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,200
Moore, Shep.
Listen to this cell phone
message and tape it.

838
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,800
I'm on it, partner.

839
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,000
Shep, I'm not
at the apartment.

840
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I tailed the Town Car...

841
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,000
Isolate and
identify the horn.

842
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,400
Enhance the voice.

843
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,400
Get some air guard choppers
and all available units
into this area.

844
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,000
Have them work the alleys
for a silver Town Car

845
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,200
and Shepherd's pickup truck.

846
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,000
Okay, what about
Liz's cell phone?

847
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,400
If it's still working,
we can do a GPS
trace on it, right?

848
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,400
Yes, we can.
Get me the Air Guard.

849
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,000
You don't
recognize me, cutter?

850
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,200
Speerman?

851
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,200
We both made it out.

852
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,600
You changed your name,
I changed mine.

853
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,400
But we're still
fellow refugees

854
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,000
who survived the Holocaust.

855
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,400
Amazing what some men will do
to save themselves.

856
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,400
Well, well, well.

857
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,400
Finally one happy family.

858
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,600
We now have
the bargaining chip.

859
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,800
Do you want him
to cut the stones?

860
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Don't do it, Isaac.

861
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,400
They're going
to kill us anyway.

862
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,600
What do you think,
old friend?

863
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,600
Never again.

864
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,200
This is for my family! Die!

865
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,600
Shep, I'm not
at the apartment.

866
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,200
I tailed the Town Car...

867
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,200
Get away from her!
Get away from her!

868
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,600
Looks like
she didn't like it.

869
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,000
Help us.
Please, help us.

870
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,400
Can't you just
cut the wires?

871
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,600
No can do.

872
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,600
It's a continuous circuit.

873
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,600
If I try
to disconnect it, well...

874
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,000
Just don't move.

875
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,200
I have to get this bomb
off of you.

876
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,600
Shep,
behind you!

877
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,600
Boyfriend's pretty tough.

878
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,800
What took you so long?

879
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,200
Careful.

880
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,200
Forget about me.
Free Elizabeth.

881
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,800
Hurry, please, hurry.

882
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,200
Go, Isaac.

883
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,800
Let's go!
Come on!

884
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,200
Come on.

885
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,800
Did you have to
blow up the building?

886
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,400
No hard feelings, huh?

887
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,000
All's well that
ends well, Parks.

888
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,600
Will you see that these get
to the Israel Museum
in Jerusalem, Shep?

889
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,800
I sure will, Isaac.
Along with the breastplate.

890
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,400
How about a trip
to Austria, partner?

891
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,800
You've got to be kidding.

892
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,400
Nope, I'm not kidding.
