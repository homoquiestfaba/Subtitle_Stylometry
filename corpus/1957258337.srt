[eerie music]

17
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:56,505
[woman] She's going to be ugly,
I tell you, like a soldier

18
00:02:56,572 --> 00:03:02,578
coming back from war with half a face
and his legs and his arms blown off.

19
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:12,454
- [breathing]
- [sighs, mumbles]

20
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,492
Oh, my God.
Are you crazy?

21
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:20,297
Get that morbid mask off
of your face!

22
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:22,232
Just... Why don't you grow up?

23
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,670
Get a bed pan ready
in case she throws up.

24
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,004
What an idiot.

25
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,839
Don't worry, Lily.

26
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:34,009
Oh, still cold from
Aunt You-Know-Who?

27
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:38,647
Aunt Naggie is only responding to
her never-ending period since birth.

28
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:43,018
- [woman gasps]
- She means well somewhere deep, deep inside.

29
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,754
Hmm.

30
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:49,692
She's going to be ugly,
I tell you.

31
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:53,196
And you... Oh! And you might
as well all just accept it.

32
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,864
Don't lie to her, okay.

33
00:03:55,931 --> 00:04:00,970
Lily has just got to face facts
like a responsible human being,

34
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:08,711
like a soldier coming back from
war with half a face and his legs

35
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,679
and his arms blown off.

36
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:14,583
You know what? I bet she's going
to be more beautiful than ever.

37
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,053
- Ugh.
- Right, Lily?

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,056
Like at prom when you
looked just like Cinderella

39
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:24,693
and everyone in the school is saying
Lily's the most beautiful girl.

40
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,565
Are you smiling?
Good. [chuckles]

41
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,800
I can't wait to see you smile
again, Lily.

42
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,004
Okay, I think it's time.

43
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:41,910
Okay. Just want to check some
of your vitals.

44
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:46,316
Let's check your...
check your heart rate.

45
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,752
[heart thudding]

46
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:52,621
- [doctor] That's normal.
- [blood pressure gauge hissing]

47
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,325
That seems normal.

48
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,894
All right, let's do this.

49
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,995
Don't!

50
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:06,101
Like a mummy in a museum,

51
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,440
a morbid corpse underneath
all those bandages,

52
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:13,776
ugly as sin.

53
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,611
Would you like me to remove
everybody from the room

54
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,013
before I take off your bandages?

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,817
[Lily] I would prefer some stay
and some leave.

56
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,652
Would you like to be more
specific?

57
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,423
Oh, you all go.

58
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:31,294
I will stay here
with the doctor, mm? And Lily.

59
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:37,467
We'll handle this maturely.

60
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:40,136
[Lily] It's okay. Please, all stay.
Let's do this.

61
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,603
Oh, God.

62
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,307
I told everybody,

63
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,276
take her off life support.

64
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:48,844
But, no. [chuckles]

65
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:49,945
Now,

66
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:53,149
the devil to pay.

67
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,584
You f... I hate everybody.

68
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,988
[doctor] Um, let's do this.

69
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,091
[suspenseful music]

70
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:38,026
Oh! [laughs]

71
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,530
- [women gasp]
- I don't have any words.

72
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:44,367
Lily, you're beautiful.
[laughs]

73
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,035
- She's beautiful! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [woman] No way.

74
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:48,804
[man's laughter continues]

75
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,512
I didn't expect this to be
so perfect.

76
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:58,381
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

77
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,916
She looks like a <i>Cover Girl</i>
model.

78
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:02,818
[man] I knew it, Lily.

79
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:06,889
Your soul is too beautiful for
any earthly nuisance to temper.

80
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:08,891
Didn't think we would be using
this.

81
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,859
[playful music]

82
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:23,606
I don't see anything.

83
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,408
Wait, what do you mean?

84
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,177
I can't see anything.

85
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,315
It was a bad accident.

86
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:35,083
The optic nerve couldn't
survive.

87
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:38,588
- That's not true.
- You... you mean temporary blindness?

88
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:41,591
Cup.

89
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,928
Look up for me, please.

90
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,331
Lily, can you see any light?

91
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,268
How about now?

92
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:03,946
I'm afraid it's permanent.

93
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,381
[suspenseful music]

94
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,766
[therapist] With practice,
not only would you be able

95
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:29,572
to read letters but in vast
illustrations and graphs.

96
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:44,621
I can't force her hands
to read.

97
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,021
She needs time.

98
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:49,192
[therapist] Was it time
that you need, Lily?

99
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,564
I've worked with Lily three
weeks, grade one basic literacy,

100
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,966
and she still refuses to learn.

101
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:02,438
At this rate, grade two and three
will never see the light of day.

102
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:08,010
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to say it that way.

103
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:10,146
She just... She's not interested.

104
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:13,849
And if you can please send me
a check

105
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:17,353
and make sure that
it's spelled out to Lady Mandy,

106
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,690
M-A-N.

107
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:24,227
And out of sympathy
for a hopeless condition,

108
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:26,429
I shall ensure a 10% discount.

109
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,370
[door closes]

110
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,972
[dogs barking]

111
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:41,344
Ow, too tight.

112
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:45,381
Tight reins on a horse
is how we learn.

113
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,917
We walk one block forward
on this street and take a left.

114
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,952
[dramatic music]

115
00:09:58,294 --> 00:09:59,961
[grunts] Ow!

116
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:02,964
Did you hear what I said?

117
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,635
Are you deaf and blind?

118
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,338
Deaf, dumb, and blind.

119
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:15,345
She refuses to walk,
so I'm walking.

120
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,482
- I'll walk her home.
- [jazzy music]

121
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:21,083
Good luck.

122
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,319
I'll be sending you
my doctor's bill.

123
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,922
What did you do
to that poor guy?

124
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:30,892
Hey, this asshole is used to
walking into walls his whole life,

125
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,762
so I just gave him
what he's used to.

126
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,764
[chuckles]
I'm so happy to see

127
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:37,767
that you still have
that evil sense of humor.

128
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,836
You taught it
and I never forget it.

129
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,337
Thank you.
I'm grateful.

130
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,383
[blows]

131
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:06,863
[blows]

132
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,432
[scoffs]
You're living like you died.

133
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,934
Better if I was dead.

134
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,470
How do you know that?

135
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,472
I'd be able to see.

136
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:17,874
How do you know that?

137
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,976
When I dream, I can see.

138
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,978
That's not the same
as being dead.

139
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:24,980
It's like it.

140
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,316
And how do you know
what being dead is like?

141
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,552
Something forbidden told me.

142
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,321
[dramatic music]

143
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:33,423
The ghost?

144
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:35,158
No.

145
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,831
You know I'm afraid of ghosts.

146
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:45,301
No. Seriously, tell me.

147
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:47,170
Amber,

148
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:49,104
I don't want to talk about it.

149
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,911
Because you're depressed,
you're going to ruin my life?

150
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,515
You have your own life.

151
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:02,017
We have been like two peas in
a pod since we were teenagers.

152
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,620
Now all of the sudden,
I have my own life?

153
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,356
Thanks a lot.

154
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:10,159
Maybe I should be the one
that dies.

155
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:13,429
- [suspenseful music]
- [inhales, sighs]

156
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,403
Do you remember
the smelly ghost in the closet?

157
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,138
[eerie music]

158
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:43,493
The closet door just swung open.

159
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:46,963
Quick, Lily, under the covers!

160
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,998
[laughter]

161
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,080
I hid under the covers
all night scared to death,

162
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:08,417
calling him the farting ghost.

163
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,753
[laughs]

164
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,156
Eventually,
we found out it was Alfred

165
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:16,626
who sat down,

166
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,762
who stole the leftover
Thanksgiving turkey.

167
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,697
[laughs]

168
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,373
[suspenseful music]

169
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,876
Is it safe to go out now?

170
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:37,880
Hold on. Let me check.

171
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,286
Coast is clear,
at least for now.

172
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,491
[owl hooting]

173
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:50,626
Then we'd scare each other
by saying,

174
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:53,462
"Look out!
He's right next to you!"

175
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,764
[laughs]

176
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,634
- The ghost is behind you!
- [screams]

177
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,303
[laughs]

178
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:12,582
That's better, Lils,
like the good, old days.

179
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,087
I was so scared we'd lose you.

180
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:21,591
You were so down,

181
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:24,660
but you made it.

182
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,429
You're okay.
You're here.

183
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,764
I'm not.

184
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,605
[suspenseful music]

185
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:41,510
[birds chirping]

186
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:53,823
So silly, habits.

187
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,041
[knocking]

188
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,142
[Lily] Yes?

189
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:19,315
Detective Bonkers
and Detective Truehart.

190
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,151
Thank you.

191
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,060
Lily, we haven't a suspect yet,

192
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,529
but we feel
you shouldn't be left alone.

193
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:35,865
Why?

194
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,135
Well, we're not so sure
this was an accident.

195
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,237
Why would someone intentionally
want to hurt me?

196
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:43,739
Not hurt you but kill you.

197
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:47,076
[ominous music]

198
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,011
Why would anyone
want to do that?

199
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:54,617
Lily, are... are you aware
of your inheritance?

200
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,352
Well, the inheritance
will go directly to you

201
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:58,054
because you lived
with your grandfather,

202
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,990
Jean-Michel Chevalier,
in France until you were 18.

203
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:04,060
And you were his favorite.

204
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,095
Now, if you were deceased,

205
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,764
that inheritance would be split up
proportionately among your family,

206
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:10,599
which your late grandfather,

207
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,703
he wouldn't have liked,
but that's the law.

208
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,705
Are you saying...?

209
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:18,274
Yes.

210
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,610
Look, please, just hire an
outside source to protect you.

211
00:16:21,677 --> 00:16:23,979
Why can't you protect me?

212
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:26,782
Well, we have our hunches,
but no solid evidence.

213
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:32,088
My God, I just don't know.

214
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,623
Look, I understand.
It's not so pleasant of an idea,

215
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,929
but Detective Truehart and I would
rather err on the side of caution.

216
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:43,632
[sighs] I understand,
but I don't know who to call.

217
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,801
Well, look, there is a detective
who's quite good,

218
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:47,170
who I can recommend.

219
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,472
Although,

220
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,373
right now, you haven't received
your inheritance yet.

221
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,478
Is there, uh... would you be able
to afford this?

222
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:57,180
If available,
I'll have him call you,

223
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,315
and perhaps you can both work
something out in deferment.

224
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,483
How's that?

225
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:02,485
Okay.
Thank you.

226
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:03,586
Thank you.

227
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:06,922
Detective.

228
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:17,299
Whoa!

229
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,502
Sorry.
Still learning how to navigate.

230
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,370
No problem, miss.

231
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:24,006
I used to be a knuckleball
catcher back in the minor league.

232
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:26,609
[chanting in foreign language]

233
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,481
What? Just 'cause it's not
sentient doesn't mean it's absent

234
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,682
of experience, right?

235
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,685
Okay, okay, settle down.

236
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:37,987
Good afternoon, Lily.

237
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:41,657
And remember,
you're at a disadvantage.

238
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,802
[suspenseful music]

239
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:55,771
By the way, miss,

240
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:58,007
you've got any hidden cameras
here?

241
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,543
I don't think so. Why?

242
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:03,779
It could be an asset or a detriment
depending upon who set them up.

243
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,251
All right.

244
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:09,485
Have a good evening.

245
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,062
How are you this glorious
afternoon?

246
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:21,564
Oh, shut up.

247
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,666
Okay. Good start. [chuckles]

248
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,468
What's with that?

249
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:29,538
You're asking me?
It's your house.

250
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:31,640
[suspenseful music]

251
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,357
Your photo journal fell down.

252
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:58,601
[chuckles]
We were such troublemakers.

253
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,610
Well, you were.

254
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,578
You influenced me.

255
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:11,281
Well, it takes two to tango.

256
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:12,381
[chuckles]

257
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:16,719
Why'd you go quiet?

258
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,488
I'm curious
why the journal fell down.

259
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:22,124
Because it was hanging off
the ledge.

260
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:25,161
Things fall, gravity.

261
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:27,129
What if it were the ghost?

262
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:29,165
The smelly ghost was my dog.

263
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:31,467
You know I'm talking
about the real ghost.

264
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,102
There was no real ghost.

265
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,170
Yes, there was.

266
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:35,804
No, there wasn't.

267
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:37,640
What about the photo?

268
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,875
It's here somewhere.

269
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:41,911
[suspenseful music]

270
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:54,391
I don't want to see it.

271
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:58,161
Come on.

272
00:19:58,228 --> 00:19:59,762
We'll be late for the lawyer.

273
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:08,904
[jazzy music]

274
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:27,223
[Amber] Here we are.

275
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,524
There is a chair right here.
I'm going to help guide you.

276
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,026
Lily, you are more beautiful
than ever.

277
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,195
[Lily] Only on the outside.

278
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,996
[chuckles] I beg to differ.

279
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,865
You are a lovely soul.

280
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,102
Not anymore.

281
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,005
Oh, leaving your frame
of mind to the doctors.

282
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:48,278
I will provide you with the one
thing I am insanely proficient at,

283
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:51,113
legal jump rope.

284
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:57,253
The... the cops haven't found out
who hit me and run yet.

285
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,255
So why do I need to be here?

286
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,723
Being that you survived,

287
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:04,526
that leaves you still
as the sole beneficiary.

288
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:08,231
[Amber] Meaning she still
inherits the $500 million?

289
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:11,533
Minus legal fees, yeah.

290
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,240
So, what are you going to do
with your fortune, Lily?

291
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,974
I don't know.

292
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,910
Well, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

293
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:24,513
[grunts] Uh, young lady,

294
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:26,582
young lady,

295
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:28,984
would you please hand these
to Lily?

296
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:33,490
Oh, and here's a pen.

297
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:40,430
Miss Vegas.

298
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:44,267
Miss Vegas will act as witness
to the legal signing

299
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:49,472
of the transference
of monies from the trustees

300
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:52,442
to her personal account.

301
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,943
- [upbeat music]
- [record scratch]

302
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,045
Young lady?

303
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:59,349
- Amber.
- Amber, um,

304
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:04,487
could you please confirm
that all is proper and true

305
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:09,658
to which Lily is signing,
being that she has no reference of sight?

306
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:12,628
- [upbeat music]
- [Amber clears her throat]

307
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:14,630
[lawyer clears his throat]

308
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:18,134
"I, Lily Chevalier, being of sound
mind on this day, July 20th..."

309
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:22,938
- And so on and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- [Amber continues reading]

310
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:27,310
God created the universe
in seven days

311
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:30,213
and it's taking you longer
to read two lines.

312
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,982
It's all standard boilerplate.

313
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,152
Just sign.

314
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:38,620
Ah, women.

315
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:41,357
Here,

316
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:44,059
you're about to be
filthy fucking rich, girl.

317
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,994
- Mm-hmm.
- Anything else?

318
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,664
Ah. Thank you, dear.

319
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,235
It'll take one week for the
transaction to be completed.

320
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,504
Why so fucking long?

321
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:57,173
Red tape bureaucracy.

322
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,841
If you want to change the law,

323
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:00,343
become a congresswoman.

324
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,179
- [kisses]
- [sighs]

325
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,813
[Amber] Come on, let's go, Lily.

326
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,524
Oh, young lady,
can you please close the door?

327
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,093
Can you close the door, please?

328
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:28,505
You definitely cheated
on the bar exam

329
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:32,375
because there's no way
a slimy turd like you

330
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:35,545
who can't even get off your fat ass
to handle your client legal papers

331
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:38,881
could possibly have the energy
to walk to class,

332
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:40,949
let alone walk the talk.

333
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,126
Hmmm.

334
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:55,731
Sure.

335
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:57,467
Blind sign it, Lily.

336
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:01,803
I'd have someone watch over her

337
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:06,875
to make sure I get my money.

338
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,877
One, two,

339
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:11,680
three, four, five, six, seven...

340
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:13,815
[loud knocking]

341
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:39,242
Amber, Lily with you?

342
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,109
[Amber] <i>No.</i>

343
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:42,378
She's not answering.

344
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,447
I'll be right over.

345
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:45,548
Okay.

346

- [eerie music]
- [sighs]

347
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:03,899
[chuckles] How do you think
I make my living?

348
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,835
Hold this.

349
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:08,770
Thank you.

350
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:11,073
Oh, yes, almost there.

351
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:20,283
Well, at least no dead body.

352
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,384
Please.

353
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:23,553
I wonder where.

354
00:25:25,622 --> 00:25:26,755
I might have an idea.

355
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:28,625
Come on.

356
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:30,426
[suspenseful music]

357
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,769
[Lily] You picked the lock.

358
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,873
How could you know that?

359
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,311
My senses beyond sight
are becoming more sensitive.

360
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:51,046
I heard of that happening,

361
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:53,650
but how could you know
about the lock?

362
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:57,587
Also, you couldn't be here unless
you checked the house first.

363
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,222
[Amber] We could have found
a spare.

364
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:02,024
No, I don't have one.

365
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,926
You ever think about opening
your own detective agency?

366
00:26:06,496 --> 00:26:07,796
Someone's watching.

367
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,932
Been there before you came.

368
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,436
I'm going to pay that no good son
of a bitch a drunken sailor's visit.

369
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:16,372
Don't.
It could be dangerous.

370
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,308
Someone wants me dead remember?

371
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:25,682
Who?

372
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:28,950
I'm not that good
of a detective yet.

373
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,889
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

374
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,642
[cane tapping]

375
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:02,251
Hey, Lily, hold up.
You've been practicing.

376
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:04,487
- Are we being followed?
- Yep.

377
00:27:04,554 --> 00:27:07,022
How do you know?
Eyes behind your head?

378
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:09,492
Eyes in front of my head.

379
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:21,337
[doctor] Look to the right,
please.

380
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:25,941
Blind as a bat.

381
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,745
Oh, sorry, by the way.

382
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:34,450
Unfortunately, the optics, sclera,
retina, fovea, macula, and optic nerve

383
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:36,017
are irreconcilable.

384
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:38,421
Then how'd she see
the reflection in the door?

385
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:39,589
She couldn't have.

386
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:41,957
But she did.

387
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:46,429
Sometimes we misconceive certain
events to a particular element

388
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,896
and are mistaken.

389
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:50,899
Her eyes are gone.

390
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:53,469
She did not see.

391
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:57,707
Oh, this is inhumane.

392
00:27:57,774 --> 00:27:59,442
You heard the doctor,

393
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:02,879
blind as a bat.

394
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,948
Putting her through
all these needless experiments

395
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:09,886
as if she was a guinea pig...

396
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:14,990
Just have some decency
and put her out of her misery.

397
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,560
[sighs]

398
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:21,798
What's everybody
looking at me for?

399
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,499
What are you saying?

400
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:24,734
You know what I'm saying.

401
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:26,803
Because I've said it before.

402
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:30,840
Have some decency
and put her out of her misery.

403
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:32,508
Have compassion.

404
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,344
I'm going to give you
five seconds of compassion

405
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:38,414
before I do something
that I won't regret.

406
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:40,683
[gasping]

407
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,421
Did you just hear what he said?

408
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:51,160
Oh, my God, are you going to
let him talk to me like this?

409
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:53,496
- Yes.
- [scoffs]

410
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,200
[sighs]

411
00:28:58,267 --> 00:28:59,302
Assholes.

412
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,437
Good riddance.

413
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,476
Thank you
for all the melodrama.

414
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:09,345
I'd like to go to sleep now.

415
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,122
I would have slugged her.

416
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:30,666
[Lily] "As... for... the... end,

417
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:36,906
but... then... because."

418
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,179
"Your hands read for you."

419
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:50,286
"Letters to ponder

420
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:54,257
messages from yonder."

421
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:57,760
[frightful music]

422
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:59,027
[disembodied voice] Hi, Lily.

423
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:02,865
Stay away from the window.

424
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,336
[panting]

425
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,013
The doctor gave me
some medicine

426
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:20,115
to dilate the pupils
and calm the nerves.

427
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:22,083
[suspenseful music]

428
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,776
We may hand it off to the feds.

429
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:49,211
Tell me something new.

430
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:51,347
Well, no more miracles
till I get paid.

431
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:54,450
[sighs] Okay, green on the way.

432
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,586
- Asshole.
- [helicopter whirring]

433
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,157
Miracle if he gets paid.

434
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,091
[dramatic music]

435
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,213
[chittering]

436
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:16,092
Shh, squirrel, be careful.

437
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,728
Your trees are being used
to hide someone watching me.

438
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:21,564
[chittering continues]

439
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,493
Hi, Lily.
Oh, heh, sorry.

440
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,827
I didn't mean to startle you.

441
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:54,396
- I'm Dick, private eye.
- Oh, yes, hi.

442
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:57,167
Sorry, my guard was down because
my attention is on there.

443
00:33:57,234 --> 00:34:00,137
Those four trees with the people
standing behind them?

444
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:02,004
Oh, yes.
How do you know?

445
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,839
I've been following them.

446
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:04,940
Can I sit?

447
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:10,279
[grunts]

448
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:14,517
Would you like a sandwich?

449
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,751
We have an extra?

450
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,586
Yes.
I packed one extra for you.

451
00:34:17,653 --> 00:34:19,355
[bag rustles]

452
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:21,023
Why?

453
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,858
I know you were joining
my picnic.

454
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,995
Ah. Hmm.

455
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:30,866
Peanut butter and banana. Huh!

456
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:31,867
My favorite.

457
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:34,204
Yes, I know.

458
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:39,041
Lily, do you have any suspicion on
why anybody would want to hurt you?

459
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,776
Kill me dead?

460
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:43,078
I'm a little fuzzy on that one.

461
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:46,448
Uncle Fun I know
since I'm a little girl.

462
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:48,551
I can never believe he would
hurt me.

463
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:50,920
Aunt Jane, she's just timid
and nice.

464
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:54,557
She couldn't hurt a fly.
Aunt Naggie, whatever.

465
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:57,393
She's just a sour puss
and her own worst enemy.

466
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,528
What about, um, Amber?

467
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:03,233
No, blood sister.
Any blood shed by me would be bled by her.

468
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,034
Lily, if it's okay with you, um,

469
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,570
I'm going to keep an eye on you
until I discover the murderer...

470
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,805
- Ah.
- ...before you're murdered.

471
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:11,208
Yes, better that way.

472
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:14,643
You have a nice face.

473
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:16,846
How would you know?

474
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,014
I feel it.

475
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:21,917
May I?

476
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:25,188
[soft music]

477
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,925
- I knew it.
- [chuckles]

478
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:33,230
Yeah, well, I was...
I was hammered in the ring a little bit.

479
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:36,599
You know, I got the cauliflower
ears, crooked nose, messed-up teeth.

480
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:40,237
- [both chuckle]
- Not what I'm feeling. Maybe your alter-ego.

481
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:43,240
- [chuckles]
- How much would you cost?

482
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:46,243
[sighs] I wouldn't charge you.

483
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:48,644
Why?

484
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:50,846
Well, in order for me
to be my best,

485
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:54,284
my heart's got to be into it,
so no money.

486
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:55,618
You do this often?

487
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:57,254
Ah, it's my first one.

488
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,520
So why now?

489
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:00,890
Time to be my best.

490
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,961
Okay, you can work for free
and kill my murderer.

491
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:08,164
And then I pay you
with my inheritance.

492
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:10,799
- Fair? Deal?
- [chuckles] Okay, we'll see.

493
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:13,203
Okay, let's go.
Them trees are too busy for me.

494
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,238
All right.

495
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:33,789
[suspenseful music]

496
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:43,999
You killed her?

497
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,468
Not yet.

498
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:49,672
So this retainer
is premeditated.

499
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:52,508
- [Naggie] Yes.
- Let's do this another way.

500
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,778
After the crime, then you pay me
to represent you.

501
00:36:58,747 --> 00:36:59,782
Mm-hmm.

502
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:05,255
Uh, you're forgetting
your money.

503
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:08,557
No, I'm not.

504
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:10,592
I don't do business this way.

505
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:13,862
After the murder,

506
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:18,867
you get me off scot-free
and you get 10%.

507
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:20,035
Of what?

508
00:37:21,637 --> 00:37:24,140
Hmm. [chuckles] You know.

509
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:27,843
[sighs]

510
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,315
[Naggie laughs]

511
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,050
[phone rings]

512
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:36,719
[upbeat music]

513
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:38,554
Johnny Jerkoff.

514
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,256
Where are you?

515
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:42,691
I am on fire.

516
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:44,260
Keep playing, pumpkins.

517
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:45,561
I'm coming.

518
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:50,065
I can't tell you how many times
I've...

519
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:53,869
[sighs] Oh, sexy, sexy.

520
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,637
You're my girl.

521
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:58,907
Hey, you know that Virgin
Islands condo we keep renting?

522
00:37:58,974 --> 00:38:00,576
Yeah, perk man.

523
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:05,080
I hate you keeping me
waiting like this.

524
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:09,419
Yeah. The Virgin Islands condo,
it's not a virgin anymore.

525
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:12,455
That's where
I'm deflowering it.

526
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:13,989
What's that mean?

527
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:17,092
I'm buying it, sexy, sexy.

528
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,428
Oh,

529
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:21,431
that is sexy, sexy.

530
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,699
Now can you hurry up
and get to me?

531
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:31,106
- Like this?
- Be careful. Yes.

532
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,775
- Ah!
- Oh, I've got it right? I got it?

533
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,077
- Yes, yes.
- I got it. [chuckles]

534
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:38,281
You're doing okay. [grunts]
Whoa!

535
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:39,748
I shouldn't have had you
tandem.

536
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:41,617
[laughs] I'm sorry.

537
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,085
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

538
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,721
Oh. [laughs, grunts]

539
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,192
You're probably better at this.

540
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:51,593
- Yes, just follow me.
- Okay. All right.

541
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,297
See? [laughs]

542
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:56,899
Yep, you got it. [chuckles]

543
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:00,270
[circuit breaker buzzing]

544
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,374
A bullet to the brain
is quick and efficient.

545
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:11,780
Strangulation.

546
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:14,783
It takes a little time
but will do the trick.

547
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,951
You need some muscle.

548
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:21,524
Stabbing.

549
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,293
You have to be careful
with blood spurts

550
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,228
getting on clothes
and everywhere.

551
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:28,997
I see.
Uh, what else is there?

552
00:39:29,064 --> 00:39:31,800
You can strangle
with your bare hands?

553
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:33,936
- [shovel scraping]
- [grunting]

554
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:39,509
This is an umbrella, simple,

555
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,411
but also could be a weapon.

556
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:44,079
Or you can throw your victim
out of a window.

557
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,349
Just make sure
it's over 10 stories high

558
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,684
or the victim can live,

559
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,187
crawl away,
and reveal your identity.

560
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:55,558
Okay, but what if I shoot,
stab, strangle,

561
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:57,726
and then throw him
out a window?

562
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,996
Shh. Have some respect
for the deceased.

563
00:40:01,063 --> 00:40:03,031
[grunts, sighs]

564
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,036
God, forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

565
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:10,038
[somber music]

566
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,820
Get a grip.

567
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:28,123
All be under the rock soon.

568
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:35,030
- Sorry, again, about falling.
- It's okay.

569
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:37,733
I try to make it a habit
of falling once or twice a day,

570
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:40,403
you know, just to bring me back
down to earth.

571
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,405
- [Lily] I can see that.
- [chuckles]

572
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:51,780
- Well, goodnight, Lily.
- Goodnight.

573
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:54,617
I'll just be out here
and make sure you're okay.

574
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:55,717
Thank you.

575
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,887
[grunts]

576
00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:01,257
Did you just lie down
on the floor?

577
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,493
Oh, yeah.
Well, I checked in town

578
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,262
and all the hotels were booked
up because of the convention.

579
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:09,064
You know you can come in
and use my couch.

580
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:12,569
Thanks,
but against private eye rules.

581
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:15,505
But neighbors may think you're
homeless and call the cops.

582
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:17,473
Well, if that's the case,

583
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,410
I'll just, uh...
I'll show them this.

584
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,245
Oh, sorry, forgot the badge.
[chuckles]

585
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:27,082
It's okay.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

586
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,351
Wait a minute,
you have bed bugs?

587
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:29,552
Only mice.

588
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:31,521
Great.

589
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:34,357
- Oh!
- Good luck.

590
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:37,025
Oh. [chuckles] Thanks.

591
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,962
[light music]

592
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,989
[owl hooting]

593
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:15,231
[suspenseful music]

594
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:30,280
Who's there?

595
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:49,766
[dramatic music]

596
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:02,779
[screaming]

597
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:05,113
Mouse, mouse, mouse! Oh!

598
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:07,350
Oh. Oh, hey.

599
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:08,484
- Dick?
- Yeah.

600
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:10,453
Are you okay?

601
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,155
Yes.

602
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:17,059
[electricity buzzing]

603
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:22,498
It's all clear,

604
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:25,668
except for the ghosts.

605
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,237
How do you know?

606
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,139
[dramatic music]

607
00:43:52,328 --> 00:43:53,596
[sighs]

608
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:58,301
Ah, coffee in the middle
of the night.

609
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,102
Ah, I like the craziness.

610
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:02,104
Yeah.
It helped me sleep.

611
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:03,639
Reverse brain.

612
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:08,110
So, uh, you want to tell me
about the magic book?

613
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:09,445
I don't know.

614
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:10,813
Hey,

615
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,115
nothing really surprises me
anymore, okay?

616
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:16,786
I mean, I've had cases ranging
from haunted houses

617
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:18,855
- to alien abductions.
- [both chuckle]

618
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,624
Those are the boring ones.

619
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,159
- Really?
- Yeah.

620
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:25,961
I mean, I've had cases
that aren't even my dreams,

621
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:27,497
things that actually happened.

622
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:28,964
So look, if you want to tell me
what happened,

623
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,268
I promise I...
I won't laugh at you,

624
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,569
at least out loud anyway.

625
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:35,638
Okay.

626
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:37,440
I'll be right back.

627
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,543
[tense music]

628
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,058
- Boo!
- [chuckles]

629
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:01,831
Oh, you got a braille book.
Are you teaching yourself braille?

630
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:03,332
Yes, by myself.

631
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:06,067
That's really cool.
It's totally magic.

632
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,336
Will magic.

633
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:08,838
What, uh, does that say?

634
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:12,341
Come on.
Were you born yesterday?

635
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:13,443
[chuckles]

636
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:24,320
Let me show you.

637
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:28,791
[light music]

638
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:32,328
"You will fall in love."

639
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:34,597
That's exciting.

640
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:38,301
"Death is near."

641
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:42,103
Now, you're just trying
to get me going.

642
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,639
No, that's what it's saying.

643
00:45:44,907 --> 00:45:46,175
What kind of a book is this?

644
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:48,845
This is a who-done-it,
dime-store novel?

645
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:52,949
No, it's a beginner's book
teaching letters and simple words.

646
00:45:54,015 --> 00:45:55,318
I-I don't understand.

647
00:45:57,854 --> 00:45:58,888
Dick.

648
00:45:59,956 --> 00:46:01,557
Okay, uh...

649
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:03,559
All right, I understand.
Keep... Keep going.

650
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:08,664
"Dick and Jane
and their dog Spot."

651
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:16,071
"Dick haunted the house.

652
00:46:16,138 --> 00:46:20,543
The abandoned house
near the seacliff.

653
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,247
Wait for others in the
neighborhood to show,

654
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:26,582
and pretend to be a ghost,

655
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:28,484
and spook them."

656
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:34,122
Wait a minute, did you... did you
hire a Dick to investigate me?

657
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,993
- Excuse me?
- A private eye to investigate a private eye?

658
00:46:37,058 --> 00:46:37,994
Why, no.

659
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:39,395
Well, then how did you know?

660
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:40,997
The book told me.

661
00:46:41,062 --> 00:46:43,733
Oh, right, some braille book
taught you about my past.

662
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:44,834
Come on.

663
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:58,180
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

664
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:00,048
[soft music]

665
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:06,956
Oh, I'm sorry.

666
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:10,293
Just bringing back a lot of
memories of my childhood and...

667
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:14,363
Well, you press one button,
and I'm 10 years old again.

668
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:16,132
It's okay.

669
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:25,241
[Dick] Listen, um...

670
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:28,311
it's getting a little late.

671
00:47:28,377 --> 00:47:31,948
I'm going to go
check on my other client and...

672
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:35,585
leave you here
to heal from my temper tantrum.

673
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:41,791
Goodnight.

674
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:44,794
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
I'll see you in the morning.

675
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,895
Goodnight.

676
00:47:58,474 --> 00:47:59,709
Book, where are you?

677
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:01,344
[suspenseful music]

678
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,512
[clock ticking]

679
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:11,654
[sighs]

680
00:48:19,762 --> 00:48:21,631
[disembodied voice] You don't
need the book.

681
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:25,601
[panting]

682
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:42,485
[disembodied voice]
You can read me in your mind.

683
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:48,090
Who are you?

684
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:51,293
[disembodied voice] Now you
can read me anytime, anywhere.

685
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,062
Just think of me.

686
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:55,064
You need to sleep now.

687
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:57,166
You're safe for the time being.

688
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,071
Goodnight, Lily.

689
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,172
Who are you?

690
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,852
No, only one per mouse.

691
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,689
Only one trap,

692
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:23,726
it does not kill two mice.

693
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:25,294
Man, some people.

694
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:28,497
What do you expect for 50 cents?
Geez, give me a break.

695
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:30,499
Some people are cheap,

696
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:33,269
but not you, Dory,
and not you.

697
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:36,072
Well, not you, buddy,
you got to die for this.

698
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,207
I'm sorry,
but it's part of the game.

699
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,445
[ominous music]

700
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,956
[Fun] Happy birthday!

701
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:30,160
- [overlapping voices]
- Happy birthday, happy birthday!

702
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,628
- Hoo-hoo!
- You surprised me.

703
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:34,663
- [whooping]
- [Jane] Hey, birthday girl!

704
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,998
[laughter]

705
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:39,835
Come on, birthday girl,
help you down.

706
00:50:39,902 --> 00:50:41,437
Watch out for the balloons.

707
00:50:44,406 --> 00:50:45,741
Are you surprised?

708
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:48,145
[Fun cheering]
Hey, the merry-go-round.

709
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,813
- [indistinct chatter]
- The merry-go-round.

710
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,581
We were hoping
to catch you off guard.

711
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:55,185
There she is,
the birthday girl.

712
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,453
Go for a ride! [laughs]

713
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,022
[cheering]

714
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:04,693
Hey, the merry-go-round,
the merry-go-round.

715
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,665
- There you go.
- The merry-go-round. The merry-go-round.

716
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:12,868
- Happy birthday.
- Here you go, sweet Lily.

717
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:15,371
You gotta take that
'cause it's funny time.

718
00:51:15,437 --> 00:51:18,541
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

719
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:22,945
- Happy birthday, happy birthday.
- [whooping]

720
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:27,850
Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday.

721
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:31,520
Hey, everybody,
it's time to have cake.

722
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:34,590
- Hey, let's go, baby.
- Cake!

723
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:39,395
- Cake, cake, cake, cake.
- We got it here.

724
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:42,031
[marching band music]

725
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:45,701
Time for cake.

726
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:48,704
- Happy birthday, girl.
- Happy birthday.

727
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:52,808
Birthday girl. Now, don't sit down
'cause you gotta have a speech.

728
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:56,179
- Speech.
- Okay, back up. [chuckles]

729
00:51:57,546 --> 00:51:58,914
I don't know what to say.

730
00:51:58,981 --> 00:52:00,583
Say anything.

731
00:52:00,649 --> 00:52:03,919
Oh, leave her alone.
She just woke up,

732
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:07,257
probably wishes she didn't.

733
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,125
Please, Naggie,
just for one day, be kind.

734
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,428
It's her birthday.

735
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:15,431
Probably wishes
she wasn't even born.

736
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:19,135
Sounds like our Naggie needs
flowers.

737
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,605
Oh, my gosh,
thank you so much.

738
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:25,141
[laughter]

739
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,610
[Naggie] Oh, my God.

740
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:30,280
He just squirted water
in her face.

741
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:31,947
[laughter]

742
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:35,784
Oh! Oh, double whammy!

743
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:39,289
All right, girlfriend.
[laughs]

744
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,557
Lily, blow out them candles,
girl.

745
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:45,094
[blowing]

746
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,030
[laughing]

747
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:54,304
Oh, you can't see it, but it is funny!
[laughs]

748
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,938
Uncle Fun candle tricks.

749
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:56,939
[laughter]

750
00:52:57,006 --> 00:53:00,277
Why can't he just grow up?

751
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,479
[party horns blowing]

752
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:04,880
I know.

753
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:07,716
I want to tell you all
something incredible.

754
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:11,154
The most amazing thing
that's ever happened to me.

755
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:14,123
[disembodied voice]
Do not tell them anything.

756
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,159
[carnival music]

757
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,560
[sighs]

758
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,634
Hey, birthday cake,

759
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:27,370
birthday cake.

760
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:29,004
Serve this puppy up.

761
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:32,908
Here it comes, here.
Oh, that was great. [laughs]

762
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:34,009
Did you see that?

763
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:36,413
That was a birthday cake slice.

764
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:37,913
- Yeah!
- [Naggie] Dessert.

765
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,981
All right.

766
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:40,350
Happy birthday.

767
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,850
[laughs]

768
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,553
You're an idiot.

769
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,922
- Oh, man.
- You're not going to eat your cake?

770
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,961
[laughter]

771
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:06,041
I am going to put that big
fork right into your brain.

772
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:08,345
- [party horn blows]
- [Fun laughing]

773
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,187
Alakazam, alakazu.

774
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,356
Watch this balloon.

775
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,225
I change for you.

776
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,660
- [pops]
- [laughs]

777
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:31,900
- [balloons popping]
- [yelps]

778
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:35,305
Oh, how enchanting.
Fortune balloons.

779
00:54:45,647 --> 00:54:47,750
"Suspect one."

780
00:54:47,816 --> 00:54:49,319
What's that supposed to mean?

781
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,721
"Suspect two."

782
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:56,759
Aunt Jane?

783
00:54:56,825 --> 00:54:57,926
What does your say?

784
00:54:57,993 --> 00:55:00,263
"Suspect three."

785
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,398
Aunt Naggie.

786
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,032
[scoffs]

787
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:12,541
"Suspect four."

788
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,645
Lily, there's one on your lap.

789
00:55:16,712 --> 00:55:17,880
Can I read it for you?

790
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:22,117
It's braille.

791
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,919
You don't say.

792
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:25,120
What does it say?

793
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:28,224
"Have a happy birthday."

794
00:55:32,694 --> 00:55:34,464
Well... [clears throat]

795
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,500
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm ready to party.

796
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:39,835
Come on.
Let's all get up and dance

797
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:42,272
and somebody turn on some music
and let's boogie.

798
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,806
[laughs]

799
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,078
[Fun] I love that game!

800
00:55:51,713 --> 00:55:54,750
Come on, everybody let's party.
[laughs]

801
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:01,291
Hi.

802
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,991
They're gone.

803
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:05,894
Drunk and gone.

804
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:08,531
You?

805
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:10,500
Drunk? [chuckles]

806
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:16,339
You lied about your fortune,
didn't you?

807
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:25,914
How did you know?

808
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:31,086
Blood sisters means
we understand each other.

809
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,788
There's more suspects.

810
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:38,161
No shit.

811
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,028
Lils, you need a gun.

812
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:41,297
I can't see, remember?

813
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:46,269
What about that private eye
you have your eye on?

814
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,669
I like him.

815
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:49,372
There was some connection,

816
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:52,040
but he's on the list.

817
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,277
No, double shit.
He's a suspect, too?

818
00:56:55,744 --> 00:56:57,180
Amber.

819
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,215
Yeah?

820
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:04,686
Is it possible Uncle Fun, Aunt Jane,
and Naggie would want to hurt me?

821
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:07,590
Not to mention
I'm a suspect too,

822
00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:10,726
but you know I would never,
ever do anything to hurt you, Lily.

823
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:12,895
I love you so much.

824
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:15,030
I would give my life for you.

825
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:16,131
I know.

826
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:19,202
I can't believe our family

827
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,770
would ever do anything
to harm you either.

828
00:57:21,837 --> 00:57:23,739
No, no, it can't be.

829
00:57:23,805 --> 00:57:25,007
Let's not think it.

830
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,748
So when's the wedding?

831
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:34,484
Oh, stop it.

832
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,587
Are you going to invite me?
Am I gonna be a bridesmaid?

833
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,055
[laughter]

834
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:42,024
The smelly ghost just coming
by you.

835
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,394
[laughs]

836
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:47,796
- Stop it.
- Come on!

837
00:57:47,863 --> 00:57:49,097
[laughs]

838
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,335
- Stop it. [chuckles]
- [sighs]

839
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,437
I love it
when you get all red like that.

840
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,539
Means it's serious.

841
00:57:58,474 --> 00:57:59,942
Stop.

842
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:02,044
[light music]

843
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,920
Babe, check me out?

844
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:13,523
Shh!

845
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,291
She's going to hear you.

846
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,025
- Ah, it's all right.
- She's right there.

847
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:20,963
Gosh.

848
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:22,398
[birds chirping]

849
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:27,869
Thank you.

850
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,444
Cheers.

851
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,545
To?

852
00:58:37,879 --> 00:58:40,483
To when you finally
get down on your knees.

853
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,287
[chuckles]
I'm always on my knees spying.

854
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,322
Well, you know exactly
what I mean.

855
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:50,460
[sighs] And you know
I'm not the marrying type.

856
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:54,997
Oh, geez, so you've been saying
for the past three years or so.

857
00:58:55,063 --> 00:58:56,131
[grunts]

858
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,842
I feel like she's going to
hear us.

859
00:59:06,908 --> 00:59:08,810
She can't.

860
00:59:08,877 --> 00:59:12,981
But these blind people,
they have these, like, extra senses.

861
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:15,218
No. She's too far away
for hearing and smelling.

862
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,519
Don't worry about it.

863
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,855
I mean, why do we got to be here
anyway?

864
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:21,957
Hey, you know why.

865
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,328
[sighs]

866
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:35,003
Oh, geez.

867
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,038
Wow.

868
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:38,374
This is so true.

869
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,609
[Dick] What?

870
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,446
Your affections have been
neglected.

871
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:50,687
Bottom numbers 39, 40, 49, 48
and 00, could be my lucky day.

872
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,723
- [both chuckle]
- Are you ready?

873
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,791
Yeah.

874
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,562
[soft music]

875
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,029
[Lily] Good day, Mr. Squirrel.

876
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:03,333
You may be the only one
I can truly trust.

877
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,410
Oh, and there is a black cat
in the neighborhood.

878
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,511
Be careful.

879
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,394

[crickets chirping]

881
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,425
Watch the traps.

882
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,928
Did your girlfriend
throw you out of the apartment?

883
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:10,666
- [mouse trap snaps]
- [chuckles, groans]

884

- [groans]
- [sucks in air, chuckles]

885
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,805
No girlfriend.

886
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,309
You're home late.

887
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:21,943
I'm young.

888
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,414
I want to enjoy life
as much as I can.

889
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,184
How old are you?

890
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:32,288
Old enough to know I shouldn't
be having this conversation.

891
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,023
Look, I'm just here to keep you
safe.

892
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:36,958
I'm safe.
Thank you.

893
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:38,494
You?

894
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,398
Me? I'm a professional,
so no worries here.

895
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,669
Have a good night.

896
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,171
I'll see you in the morning.

897
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,210
Just like that?

898
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,945
- Huh?
- You're leaving just like that?

899
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,415
What am I supposed to do?

900
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,584
Come in and check
if there's someone inside.

901
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,154
Okay. Sure.

902
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,189
Okay. Sure.

903
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,023
[jazzy music]

904
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,238
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

905
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:27,710
Uh, no.
I was just, um, looking at...

906
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:31,046
go into the rooms
and make sure that they're safe.

907
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:33,950
It's safe.

908
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,220
[Dick] Well, how do you know?

909
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,722
[Lily] My ghost.

910
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:43,226
Oh, yeah. You mean, um...
you mean your book.

911
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,861
My book is really a ghost.

912
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,729
Lily, have you been drinking?

913
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,398
No, but I can smell alcohol
in your breath.

914
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:53,736
Huh. I had a little wine
earlier.

915
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,238
[Lily] More than two glasses.

916
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:57,807
[Dick] Maybe.

917
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,410
Actually, most of the bottle,
Chardonnay.

918
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,145
California, 2008.

919
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,816
It was actually pretty good.
I, um...

920
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:10,553
Are you going to talk when you
can use your lips to kiss me?

921
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,654
Lily.

922
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,861
Lily, I don't know.

923
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,637
Lily, I don't know about this.

924
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,172
Oh, you don't know
if you're on or out?

01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,580
One less person on earth, huh?

928
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,283
[woman on PA] <i>We had a 10-56,
woman jumped from the Graft Tower.</i>

929
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,918
One less suspect.

- [indistinct radio chatter]

931
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:52,093
[Lily] Oh, oh, my God!
I knew it!

932
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,930
[moaning]

933
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,979
I knew it! [moaning]

934
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,149
She was pushed.

935
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:14,617
How do you know that, boss?

936
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,454
'Cause she crawled.
If she wanted to die,

937
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,656
she wouldn't have tried
to get away.

938
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,325
Murder.

939
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,726
Yeah.

940
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:28,096
[indistinct radio chatter]

941
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,005
[lawyer] My condolences.

942
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,175
- Who'd want to...?
- [lawyer] Some scum of the gutter.

943
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:41,510
Sign there
and the house is legally yours.

944
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,179
I don't want it.

945
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:44,981
Aunt Jane willed it to you.

946
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:47,416
Take my advice,

947
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,885
pick up your pen,
sign right there.

948
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:53,322
Otherwise, the house forfeits
to the state bureaucratic crooks

949
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,158
who murder by red tape proxy.

950
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,695
Take some time off
from the hustle-bustle.

951
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,531
Go up north to beautiful nature.

952
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:06,669
Aunt Jane's house, it's far removed
from the noise and the tumult.

953
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,537
In fact, take the whole group.

954
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,039
All of you,

955
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:14,010
spend the weekend there,
recharge your batteries.

956
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,712
But my electric car
just won't go that far.

957
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,180
You'll ride with me.

958
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,883
It'll be fun,
a road trip to the country.

959
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,052
Nice. I can drive Lily.

960
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,287
See, there you go.

961
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,556
Now all of you,
get out of here and go pack.

962
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,559
And, um, bring some bear spray.

963
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,695
Wait.
There's bears up there?

964
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,732
Oh, yeah, and lions and tigers.

965
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,568
Just keep wearing
that perfume you got on

966
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,771
and you won't have any problem.

Smells beautiful.

970
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,625
We're going to have
a beautiful time.

971
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,630
What are you doing?

972
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,100
- Feeling the vibrations.
- Oh.

973
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,903
I miss the feel of driving.

974
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,477
I have an idea.

975
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:55,611
Huh?

976
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,912
You'll see.

977
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,416
You're going to drive.

978
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,795
Amber, I'm blind.

979
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,730
And I'm crazy. [chuckles]

We both are.

[upbeat music]

982
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,818
I don't want to get you killed.

983
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,155
You're doing fine.

984
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,422
Hey. A little...
a little this way.

985
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:43,359
Perfect.

986
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:44,960
Okay.
Just keep going straight.

987
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:56,972
You're doing great.

988
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:01,178
Okay. A little this way.

989
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,045
Oh, back to the left.

990
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,381
Good. Okay.
Just keep going.

01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:07,316
Trust yourself.
You've got this.

992
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,787
We haven't passed
another car in 20 minutes.

993

better driver without your eyes.

- [Lily] Six?

climbing is better than your driving.

1004
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,784
Thank you.

1005
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:19,588
See, you're doing great. All right.
Almost there. Halfway.

1006

There we go.
Get a little in.

1007
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:24,627
All right. [groans]

Did you see this before?

Come on, girl.
Straighten up.

1066
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:33,108
So think of me as police
hospitality.

1067
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:34,743
How about that?

1068
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,379
Let's get the burgers
and sangria flowing.

1069
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:37,679
It feels like a funeral, huh?

1070
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:49,559
[knocking]

1071
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,634
- Hey.
- Dick!

1072
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,067
- [kisses]
- How do you know?

1073
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:00,669
-I'm a private eye, remember?

1074
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:05,408
Don't trust anybody.

1075
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:07,143
Don't worry.

1076
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,945
I got my blow-up bed.
I got my mouse traps. [chuckles]

1077
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,548
Hey, where is everybody?

1078
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:12,781
In the back?

1079
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,917
Let's party.

1080
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:18,221
- [gentle music]
- [indistinct chatter]

1081
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:20,256
[Sharksdale]
Hey, join the party.

1082
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:21,524
Get yourself a beer.

1083
01:14:22,824 --> 01:14:24,760
Lily, oh, Lily.

1084
01:14:24,826 --> 01:14:27,597
Hey, how you doing?
How are you?

1085
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:29,265
Good, how are you, man?

1086
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,967
Yeah, good, good, good, good.
May I ask, who are you?

1087
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,571
Oh, uh, Dick, private eye.

1088
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,071
- Oh, good.
- Who are you?

1089
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:37,973
Detective Bonkers.

1090
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,243
Um, don't you know each other?

1091
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:43,613
- No.
- No.

1092
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,649
Well, I bid this closed.
Just enjoy yourselves like this fellow.

1093
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,686
And, uh, as long as you don't
get into any trouble

1094
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:53,755
or get on my nerves, you'll survive.
How about that? Hmm?

1095
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,425
Same with you, man.

1096
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,493
- Same with you.
- All right.

1097
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,761
- [chuckles] Good time.
- You have big, strong arms, haven't you?

1098
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,565
- Yeah, real strong.
- Real strong.

1099
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:06,469
Whoa.

1100
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:09,172
Fight, fight.

1101
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:10,440
- My money's on the redhead.
- You're too angry, Dick.

1102
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,108
Come on, come on, come on.

1103
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:14,876
- [laughs]
- [Naggie] Ooh.

1104
01:15:24,254 --> 01:15:26,822
Someone should put her
out of her misery.

1105
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:36,633
[suspenseful music]

1106
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:22,478
Sounds of Lamet.

1107
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,404
[burps] Well,

1108
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:52,575
I think I'm going to go to bed

1109
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:54,076
'cause I'm going to get up
early in the morning,

1110
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,411
do a little bit of
bird watching,

1111
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:59,749
and I'm going to take
the master suite.

1112
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,151
Not a good idea to get
on my bad side, man.

1113
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:08,491
Not a bad idea if you lock your
bedroom door tonight. [clears throat]

1114
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:10,393
'Cause there's a killer
on the loose.

1115
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,562
Hey,

1116
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,030
are you going to keep watch,

1117
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:20,203
protect and serve-a?

1118
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:23,373
I'm not paid overtime, buddy.

1119
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:29,010
The city's finest,
the city's finest.

1120
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,446
All right, everybody.

1121
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:33,249
I'm going in.
See you in the mañana.

1122
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:37,553
- Maybe.
- Check things. [mumbles]

1123
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:41,890
[grunting]

1124
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:51,967
Well, your, uh, your blind vision
is better than my double vision.

1125
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:52,968
[laughs]

1126
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:55,138
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

1127
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:56,873
[laughs] I love you, guys.

1128
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,608
I love you.

1129
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,176
Oh, yeah.
And by the way,

1130
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:03,880
[mumbles] I am going to be up
all night

1131
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:07,283
in case any of you are in
the killing mood.

1132
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,520
Whoever the fuck you are.

1133
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:12,988
[laughter]

1134
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:20,797
[suspenseful music]

1135
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,468
All right, ladies.

1136
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,439
[babbling]

1137
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:37,045
[owl screeches]

1138
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:39,782
[eerie music]

1139
01:18:58,601 --> 01:18:59,802
[sighs]

1140
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:04,874
[sighs]

1141
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:09,110
[inhales, exhales]

1142
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:18,888
Ah! [laughs]

1143
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:43,579
They don't know
who they're messing with.

1144
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:45,414
[laughs]

1145
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,821
Whoa.

1146
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:54,089
Yeah. [laughs]

1147
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:58,861
[coughing]

1148
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:03,165
[grunts, groans]

1149
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:06,769
Don't mess with James Bond.

1150
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:08,671
[laughs]

1151
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:13,676
[snores]

1152
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,685
- [knocking on door]
- [lock jostling]

1153
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:24,754
[suspenseful music]

1154
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,032
[snores, coughs]

1155
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:53,783
[thunder rumbles]

1156
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,087
[snoring]

1157
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,164
[disembodied voice]
Death approaches.

1158
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,881
Why me?

1159
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,618
[disembodied voices]
Good versus evil.

1160
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,760
I feel afraid,
like when I was a little girl.

1161
01:21:37,827 --> 01:21:39,795
[disembodied voice]
That is why I have come.

1162
01:21:41,931 --> 01:21:43,366
You're scaring me.

1163
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,334
[disembodied voice]
You don't have to fear me.

1164
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,536
It's yourself you fear.

1165
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:49,705
[doorknob rattling]

1166
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,510
[panting]

1167
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:01,851
[thunder rumbles]

1168
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:11,627
I want to live.

1169
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:14,630
[disembodied voice]
You must face the fear.

1170
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:17,233
[panting]

1171
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,141
I don't believe you.
You're only my fucking imagination.

1172
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,809
[panting]

1173
01:22:35,152 --> 01:22:36,318
[disembodied voice]
You see it?

1174
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:41,657
Take it.

1175
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:44,827
You see it?

1176
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:47,196
Take it.

1177
01:22:56,173 --> 01:22:57,573
Feel it.

1178
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,775
[eerie music]

1179
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:33,909
Shh.

1180
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,485
[Lily muffled] Leave me alone.

1181
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:47,289
Come on, nuh-uh, nuh-uh.

1182
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,992
You know what lies
in this room, huh?

1183
01:23:50,059 --> 01:23:54,396
Uncle Fun isn't having fun anymore
because he lies dead on the bed

1184
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:56,665
with a knife in his heart.
Come here.

1185
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:58,334
All right. All right.
Careful now,

1186
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,669
careful,
you don't want to cut yourself.

1187
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:01,837
[Lily] No!

1188
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:03,873
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, come here.

1189
01:24:03,939 --> 01:24:06,575
All right, and our next exhibit,

1190
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:08,677
Aunt Naggie hanging
from the curtain rod.

1191
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:12,014
- No, no, no! No!
- Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, come here. Ready for this one?

1192
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:15,218
Bend down. Here we go.
That's it. Bend down.

1193
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:18,587
Look at that.
Oh, poor Sharksdale,

1194
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:21,023
[chuckles]
shot in the head.

1195
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,958
Let's go to the next one.
Come on.

1196
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:26,362
All right. Come on.

1197
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,531
[grunts] Here we go.

1198
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:30,167
Your dear friend Amber.

1199
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,271
Suffocated.

1200
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:36,772
Let's go.

1201
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:40,210
- [Lily grunts]
- [grunts]

1202
01:24:40,277 --> 01:24:45,381
I'll just tell you this one,
Bonkers' drink poisoned.

1203
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:47,616
Please don't do this.
Let me go.

1204
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:50,085
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh. Let's go to
the bedroom, shall we, for the finale?

1205
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:51,854
Come on.

1206
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:54,890
Walk up the stairs.
There you go.

1207
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:56,458
You got it.

1208
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:59,262
That's it, you're going to take
a nice right.

1209
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:00,496
There you go.

1210
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:03,666
Come on, get on there.

1211
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:05,668
[panting]

1212
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:07,837
[Dick] That's everyone.

1213
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:15,178
Just one left.

1214
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:17,847
Don't you love me?

1215
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:20,850
Didn't you?

1216
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:25,421
- Maybe.
- [soft music]

1217
01:25:27,157 --> 01:25:30,359
What an evil, ambivalent love.

1218
01:25:31,161 --> 01:25:32,528
Maybe.

1219
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:38,168
Careful.

1220
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:40,603
Close to the bullet,

1221
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:43,072
it'll hurt more.

1222
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:45,574
There's no bullet
in the chamber.

1223
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:49,778
Well, you would only know that
if you could see.

1224
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,448
Oh, yes, sweetie.

1225
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:53,716
20/20.

1226
01:25:59,222 --> 01:26:01,857
I see my guardian angel
has come.

1227
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:03,559
- What?
- Look up.

1228
01:26:05,362 --> 01:26:07,230
[ghost speaking Latin]

1229
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:11,934
What's going on?

1230
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,570
[ghost speaking Latin]

1231
01:26:17,274 --> 01:26:19,041
[Dick] What's going on?

1232
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:20,743
- Huh?
- [suspenseful music]

1233
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,222
Love red.

1234
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:36,326
The hit and run
wasn't as you said.

1235
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:39,028
The truck driver
didn't have any idea.

1236
01:26:39,094 --> 01:26:41,164
You threw yourself
in the back of his tires

1237
01:26:41,231 --> 01:26:43,666
because you desperately wanted
to die.

1238
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:47,002
You couldn't live with whatever
conscience you had left.

1239
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:49,905
This had nothing to do
with your inheritance, did it?

1240
01:26:49,972 --> 01:26:51,840
This had everything
to do with your sick,

1241
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:53,410
sick occupation.

1242
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:57,947
You're a serial killer.

1243
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:04,787
Did you love me?

1244
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,393
Did you ever love me?

1245
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:11,794
Nope.

1246
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:15,631
Well, liked you a little bit.
[chuckles]

1247
01:27:17,066 --> 01:27:18,801
Where do you want it,
lover boy?

1248
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,340
I give you that much,
but it has to be fatal.

1249
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:27,344
[ghost speaking Latin]

1250
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,846
The night is young and there
is so much prey out there,

1251
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:33,582
lurking in the misty night.

1252
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:35,851
What kind of an evil heart
has a guardian angel?

1253
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,357
Who are you?

1254
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:42,258
Good. Shoot the ghost.

1255
01:27:42,325 --> 01:27:44,427
I am your guardian angel.

1256
01:27:44,526 --> 01:27:46,562
Why do you look like me?

1257
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:50,866
We take the appearance of the most
suited to show you who you really are.

1258
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:54,237
Go away,
I don't want you anymore.

1259
01:27:54,304 --> 01:27:58,741
I've been trying to teach you right
from wrong since you were a child.

1260
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:02,077
You have one last chance,
put the gun down.

1261
01:28:02,145 --> 01:28:03,912
Remember that story I told
you about when I was a kid,

1262
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,215
and I haunted the house?

1263
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:06,416
What of it?

1264
01:28:06,483 --> 01:28:07,516
It wasn't me.

1265
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,586
- What?
- Look.

1266
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,087
- What?
- That ghost.

1267
01:28:15,325 --> 01:28:17,160
That ghost was
my guardian angel.

1268
01:28:18,328 --> 01:28:19,362
Boo.

1269
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,265
[gunshots]

1270
01:28:37,147 --> 01:28:38,381
I mean,

1271
01:28:39,882 --> 01:28:41,784
isn't this evidence?

1272
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,118
I solved the case.

1273
01:28:43,186 --> 01:28:44,787
Aren't I deserving of a trophy?

1274
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:46,289
Yes.

1275
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:54,230
Ooh. [laughs]

1276
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:58,700
[chuckles] Thanks.

1277
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:04,640
To, um, 39, 40, 49, 48 and 00.

1278
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:06,975
[chuckles]

1279
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,811
- [grunts]
- [chuckles]

1280
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:10,979
Yeah.

1281
01:29:11,046 --> 01:29:14,716
My lucky day
is now your lucky day.

1282
01:29:18,188 --> 01:29:19,556
Winning lotto numbers.

1283
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,160
Oh, yeah, right.

1284
01:29:25,928 --> 01:29:27,430
Wait a minute.

1285
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,500
Are you serious?

1286
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:33,169
$75 million serious.

1287
01:29:33,236 --> 01:29:36,772
- Oh, my God.
- My God. That is so sick.

1288
01:29:38,441 --> 01:29:40,410
- [chuckles]
- Oh, my God.

1289
01:29:40,477 --> 01:29:42,845
Yeah, because it's sick.
[clears throat]

1290
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:47,250
How do... How do you pull
these things off?

1291
01:29:47,317 --> 01:29:49,419
I don't know,
just my guardian angel.

1292
01:29:49,486 --> 01:29:50,853
Can we just go home?

1293
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,821
- Who, me?
- And get all cozy?

1294
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,525
Like we're old and gray and
we're gonna have three babies.

1295
01:29:55,592 --> 01:29:59,529
Well, uh, that just depends on
if there's any murders tonight.

1296
01:29:59,596 --> 01:30:02,365
- [chuckles]
- Oh, there's always going to be murders.

1297
01:30:02,432 --> 01:30:03,466
[laughter]

1298
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:12,007
I'm Mr. Berenger.
Berenger, Berenger, and Berenger.

1299
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:16,111
I guarantee you I can triple
your money in three months.

1300
01:30:16,179 --> 01:30:18,348
And by the way,
I think somebody murdered my wife,

1301
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:19,882
so could you give me a call?

1302
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:21,551
[suspense music]

1303
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,457
Wow.

1304
01:30:27,524 --> 01:30:28,690
There you go.

1305
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:29,892
Come here.

1306
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,693
[light music]

1307
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,136
[eerie music]
