1
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:23,110
[ominous music]

2
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,851
[beeping]

3
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,637
JANITOR: Don't you ever go home?

4
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:16,032
Oh, I got to finish
this report by Tuesday.

5
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:16,902
Have a happy Fourth.

6
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:17,816
Right.

7
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,733
GROUND CONTROL: Flight 1055,you're clear for final approach

8
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,648
into Denver.

9
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:28,175
Come on down to
1,500 feet, cowpoke.

10
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:31,003
Denver approach,
Flight 1055 descending

11
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,222
through 1,500 [inaudible].

12
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:33,223
GROUND CONTROL:
Thank you, partner.

13
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:44,191
Folks, we've turn onthe fasten seat belt sign,

14
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,757
and we started our
descent into Denver.

15
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:49,370
We'll have you in the MileHigh City around 8:15.

16
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,893
That should be plenty
of time for you

17
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:54,157
to rest up for tomorrow'shot dogs and fireworks.

18
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,855
The current temperature inDenver's about 75 degrees.

19
00:01:56,986 --> 00:02:00,729
But it's going to zoom all theway up to 95 degrees tomorrow.

20
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,081
It's going to a hot,
sticky Independence Day.

21
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,561
On behalf of the
entire flight crew,

22
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,389
we want to wish you a safeand happy 4th of July.

23
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,428
PILOT: Unfortunately,
this low cloud cover

24
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,560
is going to keep us fromshowing you a beautiful view

25
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,476
of the Mile High City skyline.

26
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:53,999
And we're going to
be in this thick soup

27
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,132
until we touch
down on the runway.

28
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:57,481
We're going to be
putting on the fasten

29
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,962
your seat belt sign
in just a few minutes.

30
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,442
So if you want to
stretch your legs,

31
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,357
this is a good time to it.

32
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,334
What the hell?

33
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,814
Where's the runway?

34
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,294
I got it.

35
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:28,425
Full throttle.
Go around.

36
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,036
Flaps up.
Trim for climb.

37
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,081
Not responding.

38
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,517
PILOT: Turn off the autopilot.

39
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,997
Shut down the computer.

40
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,999
Shutting down.

41
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,479
Still not responding.

42
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:42,483
We're too low!

43
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:43,397
The plane's going down!

44
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:44,485
We're gonna crash!

45
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,487
[indistinct yelling]

46
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:47,488
COPILOT: Switching to manual.

47
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,489
Adjust the trim.

48
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:49,490
The rudder's frozen.

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,665
Still no control.

50
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,971
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Take your seats.

51
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:55,017
[inaudible] seat belt.

52
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,453
COPILOT: Mayday, [inaudible].Mayday.

53
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:57,454
The controls are dead.

54
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,934
Nothing's responding.

55
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:06,420
Oh, god.

56
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,910
[explosions]

57
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:40,454
[elevator dings]

58
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:41,890
Neil.

59
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,848
Neil, what happened?

60
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,502
Well, they crashed.

61
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,461
Keller says we've got peoplefrom Washington coming.

62
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,375
Where is he?
Hey, boss.

63
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,550
My presentation.

64
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
- I'm just finishing it.
- Move it.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,467
And just remember the
operative phrase for you

66
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:54,772
two is seen and not heard.

67
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:55,643
Got it?

68
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:56,644
Right.

69
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:57,993
Put on some pants, Neil.

70
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,647
And for god's sake,
lose the earring.

71
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,479
OK.

72
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,958
Gentlemen, thank
you for coming.

73
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,484
Two hours ago, Flight 1055crashed into the largest

74
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,660
skyscraper in Denver.

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,140
Half of downtown isstill engulfed in flames.

76
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,969
Based upon the rising toll
of dead and injured, not

77
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,973
to mention the property damage,this is hands down the worst

78
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,324
disaster in aviation history.

79
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,803
Jesus Christ.

80
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,893
That's three major
crashes in three weeks.

81
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,940
Doesn't anybody here have aclue as to what's going on?

82
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,987
General Roberts from
the NSA has an idea.

83
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,380
He'll be joining us shortly.

84
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,774
But now here's
what the FAA knows.

85
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,950
Flight 1055 stopped
responding to air

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,082
traffic controllers
approximately one hour

87
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,736
before it crashed.

88
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,434
DIA went nuts trying
to raise them,

89
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,523
and they could not
get a response.

90
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,395
Any read on those black boxes?

91
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,702
Our first look at the
flight data recorder

92
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,834
reads like they were rightwhere they were supposed to be.

93
00:05:56,965 --> 00:06:01,535
The cockpit voice recorderwas empty, nothing.

94
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,364
Obviously they've bothbeen tampered with somehow.

95
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,409
What about those
first two crashes?

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,716
Any similar mechanical failures?

97
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,371
Actually there are.

98
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:14,330
Neil, that's good
of you to join us.

99
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,550
Rudy, let's run the demos.

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,944
You're looking at three
spectacular crashes.

101
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,730
In each case, the crewswere unaware of any problems

102
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,123
prior to the lost communication
between the aircraft

103
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,473
and the ground.

104
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:30,128
First, Flight 232
from Honolulu to LAX--

105
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,740
new engine shut downhalfway through the flight.

106
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,220
It plunged into the Pacific.

107
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:40,182
Flight 90, JFK to
Seattle, this one

108
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,619
veered 200 miles from
the original flight path

109
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,274
and crashed into a mountain.

110
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,320
Again, controllerspowerless to get through.

111
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,889
Gentlemen, the news
is getting worse.

112
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,240
A half hour ago, the
Pakistan terror group

113
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,721
Red Dawn claimedresponsibility for the crash

114
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,202
of flight 1-0-5-5.

115
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,030
They've also
claimed responsibility

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,074
Jimmy Hoffa and El Nino.

117
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,336
Shut up.

118
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,250
What was that?

119
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,953
Sir, I was just saying doesn'tthe Red Dawn seem a little,

120
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,086
well, organized for
something of this scope?

121
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,872
[chuckles] Just howextensive is your knowledge

122
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,743
of terrorist groups?

123
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,616
My right-hand man spent
two years with Red Dawn.

124
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:26,097
But maybe, just maybe, youknow more than he does.

125
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,143
I'm not suggesting that, sir.

126
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,711
I'm suggesting that we'rethinking inside the box.

127
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,190
I think we're dealing
with a whole new breed

128
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:36,238
of terrorist here,
a computer hacker.

129
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:39,546
The FBI's Computer CrimeUnit doesn't think so.

130
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:40,547
Move on, Neil.

131
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,679
No, hear me out, Sam.

132
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,508
Listen, each plane that wentdown was the same model jet.

133
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,815
And each one had a flightcomputer retrofitted

134
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,034
with the new Oxcilis
chip, which drains

135
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,558
an unprecedented
amount of control

136
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,168
from the pilot to the computer.

137
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,736
It's the same chip thatprevented 23332 from ditching

138
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,216
last year, that rerouted
hundreds of planes

139
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:00,218
this year alone around
dangerous weather.

140
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,439
And which was manufacturedby a company with the most

141
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,659
lax security imaginable.

142
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,835
I mean, I'm talking a12-year-old could hack in--

143
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:10,968
Son, I don't know what
you've been smoking.

144
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,493
Because what I'm smelling hereis a whole lot of horse shit.

145
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,495
You know, even a
redneck old fart

146
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,061
like me knows that
a plane's computer's

147
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,933
not connected to the ground.

148
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:21,718
They're self-contained so thata hacker can't gain access

149
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,416
unless he's on the plane.

150
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,331
Let me explain.

151
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:30,118
This guy hacks into the
mainframe of the company

152
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,033
that makes the chip, OK?

153
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,078
Then alters the
programming on the chip

154
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,952
itself, telling it to link upto him once it's in the air.

155
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:41,912
What the FBI needs fromthe is technical analysis

156
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:45,307
not these conspiracy theoriesand intellectual bullshit.

157
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,265
And that's exactly
what you will get, sir.

158
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,441
Neil will have the break down onthe on-board computer sequences

159
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,747
done by noon.

160
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,183
We will be pursuing
this investigation

161
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:54,795
per the instructions
of General Roberts.

162
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,536
Anything else?

163
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,189
Man, all I'm saying is thatthe Red Dawn couldn't have had

164
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,321
the technological know how--

165
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,018
Son--

166
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,325
I think we're done here.

167
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,110
Let's go.

168
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,635
I want you to do the computermodels and break down the data,

169
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:09,984
and that's all I want you to do.

170
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,376
I can do that with
my eyes closed, Sam.

171
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,987
- Then do it!
- I'm sorry.

172
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,510
If I see something important,I'm gonna point it out.

173
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,685
There are lives at
stake here, Sam.

174
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,121
You listen to me.

175
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,167
You are not one of
the investigators.

176
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,778
You are on this task
force to crunch numbers.

177
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,085
The FBI has computercrime specialists to bring

178
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,129
in if that's what they need.

179
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,174
Sam, just hear me out.

180
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,131
No.

181
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,872
Hear me out, hotshot.

182
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,179
Don't you ever run roughshodlike that over me in a meeting.

183
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,354
I was expressing an opinion.

184
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,661
You were out of line!

185
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,969
If you do it again, I willdrop you like a bad habit.

186
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,755
Whoever's doing thisisn't going to stop, Sam.

187
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:46,716
They're going to strike anotherplane and strike it soon.

188
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,302
One more flight to go.

189
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:10,305
You know, from now on
July 4th isn't just

190
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,349
America's Day of Independence.

191
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,178
It's also Josie Wallus's--

192
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,398
free from the sky and
running my own business.

193
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,052
Hold on there, girl.

194
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,054
You're sounding like you'vegot short-timer's disease.

195
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:21,403
What?

196
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,144
Mm-him, using the
last flight to take

197
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:26,277
revenge on all the ghostsof bad passengers past.

198
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,149
[laughing] You know
what I'm talking about.

199
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,367
Wait.
Wait.

200
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,152
Wait.

201
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,849
You're under the impression thatI'm actually working tonight.

202
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,546
I mean, I thought you weregoing to let me take it easy.

203
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,026
Oh, don't even try.

204
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,420
[laughing] Besides,
it's a holiday red eye.

205
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,551
It's a piece of cake.

206
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,988
Exactly what I planned--

207
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,120
hardly any passengers
and most of them asleep.

208
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,687
Hey, did I tell you
I signed the lease?

209
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:46,863
Only about 10 times.

210
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,431
[laughing] I'm gonna
miss you, Josie.

211
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,563
Aw, well, you're not
done with me until dawn.

212
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,957
Oh, I'm sorry we're gonnabe done with you at all.

213
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, thanks, Paul.

214
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:57,047
That's nice to hear.

215
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,615
So, um, tell me, those,um, hippety-hoppity clothes

216
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:00,572
you're going to be selling--

217
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:01,661
[laughter]

218
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,792
It's hip hop.

219
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:04,228
Ah.

220
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,577
Oh, right.

221
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,101
Um, those are those
ridiculous clothes

222
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,277
that my nieces and nephewslove and I hate, right?

223
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,800
Right.

224
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:11,758
That's why I'm gonnagive them a big discount.

225
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,585
[laughter]

226
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,762
It's one route awayfrom a life on the ground

227
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,589
and coincidentally
one route away

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,026
from your last chance with me.

229
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,158
[laughing] Now that's
got to break her heart.

230
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,420
[laughing].

231
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,726
Flight check.

232
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,467
Aye-aye, Captain.

233
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:26,686
Think about what you're missing.

234
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,083
Never.

235
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,084
That's it.

236
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,696
My god, makes perfect sense.

237
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,959
Each plane that crashed hadthe Oxcilis chip, right?

238
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,612
Yeah, but there arehundreds of planes that have

239
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,527
the chip that haven't crashed.

240
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:43,441
Yeah, I know.

241
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,791
But look at this.

242
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,010
Sam, how you doing?

243
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:49,360
You're going to have
that analysis done soon?

244
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,492
You know it.

245
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,536
Just finishing it now, boss.

246
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:58,543
OK, we narrowed it downto the models [inaudible]..

247
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:01,851
Then eliminate the planes
that aren't flying.

248
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,940
Cut out the commuter planesand international flights

249
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:06,987
because this guy likes big,spectacular US crashes.

250
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,684
Neil, you're not
a secret agent.

251
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,555
That narrows it
down to these three--

252
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,384
Austin to Omaha, Providenceto Atlanta, Seattle to Salt

253
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:14,342
Lake City.

254
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,299
Neil--

255
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,910
And he's escalating.

256
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,912
It's going to be morespectacular than the last one.

257
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,132
More specular than
annihilating Denver?

258
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,568
I'm dead serious, Rudy.

259
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,875
I think we got the
power to stop this guy.

260
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,530
Look, this flight's beenrerouted, 2:00 AM departure.

261
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,140
It's going from Milwaukee to--

262
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,013
--Washington, DC.

263
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,755
It's going to DC
on the 4th of July.

264
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,105
If you want spectacular,
that's the one.

265
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,497
Wait, what are you--
what are you doing?

266
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,891
You-- you can't just
go to Milwaukee, Neil.

267
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,197
Neil!

268
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,633
Look, if I'm wrong,
I get disciplined.

269
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,287
Maybe I get fired.

270
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,289
But if I'm right, people die.

271
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,769
I couldn't live with that.

272
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,554
I really think you're
making a mistake, Neil.

273
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,164
Look, [scoffs] if
you're so convinced

274
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,340
the plane's in trouble,
why don't you just call?

275
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,341
Rudy, I got to do it myself.

276
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:58,299
I call Keller.

277
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,083
He starts screaming.

278
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,520
Maybe he sends some no-brainerdown to check out the computer.

279
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,218
I still think you're
making a mistake, man.

280
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,350
We live in a
binary world, right?

281
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,961
It all comes down
to ones and zeros,

282
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,049
black or white, yes and no.

283
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,311
Come on.

284
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,052
That's self-indulgent
programmer crap.

285
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,271
In the real world, wedeal with shades of gray.

286
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,752
Stay or go, do or die.

287
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,101
Tell Keller I went out
to get some coffee.

288
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:32,420
[energetic music playing]

289
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,204
Getting back to our topstory, "Disaster "in Denver,

Laura Ward, please pick upthe the white courtesy phone.

crew member are confirmed dead.

296
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:49,219
I want it monitored 24-7.

297
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,655
Yep.

298
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:53,223
Are we going to see
the White House, Mom?

299
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:54,268
That's right, Tobaz.

300
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:57,010
And a big museum with dinosaurs.

301
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,359
CHILD: Cool.

302
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,709
You know, call me
if there's any change.

303
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,407
Look, of course that's OK.

304
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:04,321
Got it.

305
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,106
Bye.

306
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,804
You know, maybe this isn't theright time to go on holiday.

307
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,675
New residents are
coming in next week,

308
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:11,851
and I need to be
at the hospital.

309

Philip, we are
on family vacation.

And this is the only time youget to spend with your son.

311
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,118
Of course.

Hey, I'm so glad you called.

You know, go to the hospital,check their blood pressure.

Hey, don't I know you?

DR. PHILIP: --vitals
every four hours.

318
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,045
Make sure somebody
stays with him 24-7.

319
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,264
Nope, I don't think so.

320
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,787
I know this
sounds like a line,

321
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,007
but you look very
familiar to me.

322
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,400
Mm-hm.

323
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,967
But then again, if
I don't know you well,

324
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,273
that can be fixed
right here today.

325
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,275
I'm Ray-- Ray Macklin.

AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
[OVER LOUDSPEAKER]:

327
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:48,888
Because of security
measures, this will take

328
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,454
a little longer than usual.

329
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,499
We are now seating firstclass passengers and rows 40

00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,587

336
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:17,394
Is there a chance I
could [inaudible] seats?

337
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,615
The boss told me with
the DC trip and my job,

338
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,356
it's the only reason I'm here.

339
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,966
I hate to fly.

340
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:29,798
Yeah, I love airports--plastic food, plastic people.

341
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,278
[energetic music]

342
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,766
Listen, all I'm saying isit would take a lot longer

343
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,333
to get on this damn
plane than it's

344
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,682
going to take to get to DC.

345
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,162
It's for your safety
and security, sir.

346
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,469
Well, I'll feel
a lot more secure

347
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,907
once I make it to my damnsales meeting on time.

348
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,691
Enjoy your flight.

349
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,563
Yeah, right.

350
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,651
Ray?

351
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,958
Ray Macklin?

352
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,961
Oh, Jesus.

353
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,136
It's been a long time.

354
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,833
Sure has, Max,
since high school.

355
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,922
And you know my tooth is stillchipped where you hit me.

356
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,576
- You deserved it.
- That's debatable.

357
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:09,881
Would you like a
pre-flight beverage?

358
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:10,708
No.
I'm fine.

359
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,014
Thanks.
- Good.

360
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,886
Excuse me.

361
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:15,800
Jesus.

362
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:16,758
Here we go.

363
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,680
Is there a problem?

364
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,550
Yes.

365
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,464
You.

367
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:45,613
Ah!

368
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,006
Uh, man.
JITTERY MAN: Sorry.

369
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,007

370
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,226
FEMALE PASSENGER: It's OK.

371
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:53,273
Here you are, honey.

372
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,187
Thanks.

374
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:26,958
Hey!

375
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,004
No parking!

376
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,223
Hey!

377
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:31,441

378
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,355

Airport Security.

380
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:44,802
Hey!

381
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,282
Stop!

382
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,283
FAA emergency.

383
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,241
Stop him!

384
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,597
Hey, stop the plane!

385
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:57,815
I need you to bring
back that plane.

386
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,339
Stop that plane!
Hey, buddy.

387
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,644
You don't who you're
dealing with here.

388
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,385
- Son--
- I'm with the FAA.

389
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,908
You better show me some ID.

390
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,127
My chest bottom pocket.

391
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,520
[jet engine running]

392
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,266
Sorry.

393
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,876
Get the pilot of that
plane on the phone.

394
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:15,790
I'm so--

395
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,660
Get it done.

396
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:23,232
Patch me through to 617.

397
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,974
Thank you.

398
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,541
Captain O'Kelly, I have
a representative here

399
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:28,933
from the FAA, and you
need to talk to him.

400
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,021
Thank you.

401
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,632
Captain?

402
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,242
Listen, I think someone'sfucked with your computer.

403
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:36,637
I need to run some checkson it before you take off.

404
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,334
Ground control, we're
staying put until this

405
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,554
is straightened out, over.

406
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,598
Roger, 672.

407
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,471
Hold your current position.

408
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,255
We're gonna roll
out the red carpet

409
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,039
and open up the front hatch.

410
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,346
Thank you.

411
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,478
We need to get
out to that plane.

412
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:52,522
This way.
Let's go.

413
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,746
[beeping]

414
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:01,966
Yes?

415
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,056
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: Josie, prepareto open the front hatch.

416
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:05,970
Yes, sir.

417
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,721
Why are we moving?

418
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,593
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: I
don't have a clue.

419
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:20,507
Disengage autopilot?

420
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,856
Never turned it on.

421
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,074
COPILOT: I'll hit
the override anyway.

422
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,946
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: Do it.

423
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,339
Paul, what the hell?

424
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:27,775
You didn't get the clear.

425
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:28,732
Hey.

426
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:29,777
What the hell was that?

427
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,126
We just started moving, sir.

428
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,649
Everything is fine.

429
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,737
No, but why did it--why did it jerk like that?

430
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,435
There's nothing
to worry about.

431
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:41,789
FAA emergency.

432
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,790
We need your truck.

433
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,660
Go ahead.

434
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,271
Great.

435
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,576
OFFICER: You in?

436
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:47,664
I'm good.
Go!

437
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,231
Go!

438
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,232
GROUND CONTROL: 672, whatthe hell are you doing?

439
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:51,625
The plane's moving on its own.

440
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:55,803
Hey.
Hey.

441
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,804
Hey.
Hey.

442
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,285
Deeper breaths are better.

443
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,764
[breathing deeply]

444
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:04,768
Goddamn it.

445
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:10,209
He's moved it.

446
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:15,736
OFFICER: Hang on!

447
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,226
GROUND CONTROL: 672, 672,you have not been authorized

448
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,227
to proceed to the taxiway.

449
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,099
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: Thisaircraft is moving on its own.

450
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,839
COPILOT: We're
gonna clip his tail!

451
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:32,970
Cut the computer.

452
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:33,710
Shut it down.
- I'm trying.

453
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,624
I can't.

454
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,501
No!

455
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:42,980
[shrieks]

456
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,939
WOMAN: I think we just hitsomething on the runway.

457
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,375
Oh, my god, we're
off the runway.

458
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,942
GROUND CONTROL: Return
to the gate immediately.

459
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,160
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: I'd
like nothing better,

460
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,292
but I can't
[inaudible] autopilot.

461
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,601
Well, what can we do?

462
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:55,558
[sighs] Strap
yourself in and pray.

463
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,605
We've got no control.

464
00:20:58,735 --> 00:20:59,475
Go!

465
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:00,433
Go!

466
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:01,999
Go!

467
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,524
I'm calling in backup.

468
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,003
Get me to the plane first!

469
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,004
There's no time.

470
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,968
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: Ground control,we are moving on to the runway.

471
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,491
Oh, god.

472
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,492
COPILOT: Holy shit!

473
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:17,972
Rudder hard to starboard!

474
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,460
I can't do anything.

475
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,072
We're gonna ram him.

476
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,029
No.
No.

477
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,943
No.

478
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,995
Keep going!

479
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,649
GROUND CONTROL: 672, youare crossing into the path

480
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,303
of an incoming flight.

481
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,479
If you maintain your presentcourse, you will collide.

482
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,785
I repeat, you will collide.

483
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,265
We have no control
over the aircraft.

484
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:51,875
Divert them.

485
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:52,920
GROUND CONTROL: They'rehalfway through their descent.

486
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,400
I can't divert them.

487
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,010
And be aware of a ground
vehicle under your tail.

488
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,578
That must be that FAA
guy trying to get on.

489
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,101
Josie, go back and
open the rear hatch.

490
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,450
- OK.

491
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,060
If anything goes wrong,
you slam it shut.

492
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,020
We'll talk to him from the air.

493
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,022
Closer!

494
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,328
Get me the rear hatch.

495
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,025
We're following
behind those engines.

496
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:11,982
The jet blast will kill us!

497
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,070
Do it!
Do it!

498
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:13,984
Do it!

499
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,430
You got one chance here.

500
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:28,999
GROUND CONTROL: 672,
abort your takeoff.

501
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,913
Abort!

502
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,401
Prepare for collision.

503
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:40,359
COPILOT: We're dead.

504
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:46,843
[indistinct shouting]

505
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,294
[indistinct shouting]

506
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,297
Great.

507
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,345
Made it.

508
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,565
What the hell's going
on with this airplane?

509
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,002
Take me to the cockpit
and I'll show you.

510
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,399
CAPTAIN O'KELLY:
Ladies and gentlemen,

511
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,749
this is the captain speaking.

512
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:26,317
As I'm sure you noticed, we hada bit of a scare on takeoff.

513
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,842
Rest assured that
everything is fine now.

514
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:30,670
Fine?

515
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,020
We've got a navigational systemthat's setting its own course.

516
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,674
Yeah, can you bypass
the flight computers?

517
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,240
I don't know.

518
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,633
I've never seen anything
like this before.

519
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,548
I have no idea what's happening.

520
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,898
Like I said, somebody's beenfucking with your computer.

521
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:42,769
You're from the FAA?

522
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,292
Yeah-- Neil McCabe.

523
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,946
You know something aboutwhat's happening here?

524
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,991
Plane was refitted withthe Oxcilis system, right?

525
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,297
Right.

526
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,907
So were all the
planes that went down.

527
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,605
Someone's altered thechip's programming to give

528
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:53,736
them control of this plane.

529
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,259
That's impossible.

530
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,697
Is this plane respondingto anything that you do?

531
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:58,741
No.

532
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,613
Do you have a screwdriver?

533
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:03,267
What are you going to do?

534
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:05,792
Yank the problem
out by its roots.

535
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:08,359
MAN [OVER SPEAKER]:
No, no, no, I

536
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,188
wouldn't do that if I were you.

537
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,453
You extrude that chip andmy fail safe mechanism's

538
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,541

539
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,064
Immediate engine
failure followed

540
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:19,675
by a nice muzak medley.

541
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:20,546
What the hell?

542
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,895
Jesus, who is that?

543
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,070
MAN [OVER SPEAKER]:
How rude of me.

544
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,291
Let me introduce myself.

545
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:31,078
My name is Cain.

546
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,864
I'll be your guide for todayas we ride into darkness,

547
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:38,172
a ride you won't soon forget.

548
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:41,262
Then again, it will be thelast ride you ever take.

549
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:48,095
So sit back, relax, do notattempt to adjust the controls.

550
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,317
I control the horizontal.

551
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,797
[screaming]

552
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:08,158
I control the vertical.

553
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,116
He's trying to kill us.

554
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:12,598
[inaudible]

555
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:14,077
[screaming]

556
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,037
Nothing's responding.

557
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,995
Goddamn it!

558
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,519
[beeping]

559
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,479
CAIN: I'm in control.

560
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,047
I control your lives.

561
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,962
How can he hear us?

562
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,573
Must have bugged the cockpit.

563
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,314
No.

564
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,403
In the other crashes, the tapesin the black box were blank.

565
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,971
That must be what's happeningto the cockpit voice recorder.

566
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,499
Get ground control now.

567
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,718
The radio's dead.

568
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:46,806
He's cut us off completely.- Man.

569
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:47,894
How are the gauges?

570
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:48,808
Everything's steady.

571
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,592
Fuel OK?

572
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,550
Full capacity.

573
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,030
Paul, what are you doing?

574
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:58,339
No nut job does that to myplane and scares my passengers.

575
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,341
Try and retry the
emergency channels.

576
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,951
Stay here and stay fastened in.

577
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,349
What the hell are you
guys doing up there?

578
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,742
Captain, excuse me.

579
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,091
Everybody all
right back there?

580
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,136
No injuries, no damage,
but the passengers

581
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,007
are freaking out.

582
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,792
WOMAN: You can say that again.

583
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:19,534
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Paul O'Kelly,

584
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,101
and I'm the captain
of this plane.

585
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,015
What's going on?

586
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,277
VARIOUS PASSENGERS: Yeah!

587
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,061
Needless to say,
we're in a crisis.

588
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:28,282
But I want to assure you thatI and the rest of this flight

589
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,936
crew are going to do
everything we can to get

590
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,372
you down quickly and safely.

591
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,286
He did that.

592
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,853
He controlled the plane!

593
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,376
No, he doesn't.

594
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,508
I may have to rewire andrun off the backup system,

595
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,686
but that moron controls nothing.

596
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,165
[screaming]

597
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,451
Do not make me repeat myself.

598
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:09,889
This plane is mine.

599
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,239
Once again, enjoy your flight.

600
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,196
WOMAN: We need a doctor!

601
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:14,676
[distressed yelling]

602
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,072
[crying]

603
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:22,118
My god, he's gonna kill us!

604
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,163
No!

605
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,512
Please, calm down.
It's OK.

606
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,469
It's OK.

607
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,994
Thank god, he's alive.

608
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:29,865
We need to move
to a safer place.

609
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,693
I-- I can move thepeople out of first class

610
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:32,825
to the empty seats in the back.

611
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,348
Perfect.

612
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:36,742
And see if you can
find neck brace.

613
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:37,960
What can I do?

614
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,310
Get me some men
to move him, please.

615
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,399
I'm gonna need to ask all ofyou to move to the rear cabin.

616
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,966
Oh, hell no.
I'm not moving.

617
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,925
Please, sir.
This is an emergency.

618
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,710
We'd really appreciateyour cooperation Thank you.

619
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,539
How could you people letsomething like this happen?

620
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,410
I'm not moving
unless she's moving.

621
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,281
I'm moving.

622
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,762
You do the same.

623
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:57,850
Thank you.

624
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,068
Thanks.

625
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:01,636
I paid for a
first class ticket.

626
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,420
Yo, Doc, fix him up
so he can do his job

627
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,509
and fly this damn plane.

628
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,120
My husband will
do his best, OK?

629
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,036
Ray, stop complainingand make yourself useful.

630
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,341
Help them get him
into first class.

631
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:12,255
Fine.

632
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,126
Thanks for helping.

633
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:14,605
RAY: All right.

634
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,606
Excuse me.

635
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,520
Excuse me.

636
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:17,521
Who is that on TV?

637
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,001
Tell us what's going on!

638
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,611
As soon as we know
what the situation is--

639
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,352
We have a doctor on boardwho's taking care of the--

640
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,266
There's a doctor?

641
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,834
I need a doctor.

642
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,227
Let me help you with
some of these people.

643
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:31,971
Lean your head back.

644
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:32,841
Lean your head back.

645
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:33,973
That's-- that's it.

646
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:36,105
Oh.

647
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,106
[grunting]

648
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,241
All right, I helped.

649
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,069
Now you be sure and fix him up.

650
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,461
Yeah.

651
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:45,375
Thank you, sir.

652
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:46,376
We appreciate your help.

653
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:48,117
Yeah.

654
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,205
Yeah, you, captain junior overthere, no waiting for him,

655
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,641
all right?

656
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:51,773
Get in that damn cockpit
and fly this plane.

657
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,079
Thank you, sir.

658
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:53,993
Yeah.

659
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:54,907
Yeah.

660
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:57,257
All right.

661
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,128
[indistinct angry chatter]

662
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,783
Definite cerebral concussion--although I don't think

663
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,916
he is permanently paralyzed.

664
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,700
We've got no pilot
in that cockpit.

665
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:06,962
It's him.

666
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:07,876
[distressed chatter]

667
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:08,834
No, no, no.

668
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:09,704
I can't believe this shit.

669
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,662
Why don't you shut up!

670
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,796
Ray, just sit your ass down.

671
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,190
Fasten your seat belt
and shut your trap.

672
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,844
But we need to get
him to a hospital.

673
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:20,497
Christ.

674
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,456
I'm not able to get anythingon the emergency channels.

675
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:23,979
Can you keep him stabilized?

676
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,806
Only for a while.

677
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:28,549
All right.

678
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:29,289
I'll let the passengers
know what's happened.

679
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,203
Thanks.

680
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,817
OK, and Doc, you
take care of him.

681
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,124
Can-- can I have
your attention please?

682
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,516
[distressed shouting]

683
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,127
Listen.

684
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,084
Who the fuck are you?

685
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:42,998
VARIOUS PASSENGERS: Yeah!

686
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,783
My name's Neil McCabe.

687
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:48,917
I'm with the FAA-FBI task forceworking on the recent crashes.

688
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,266
We're gonna crash!
Goddamn it!

689
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,441
Everyone, please, it's OK.

690
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,573
Just please, calm down.

691
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:53,661
Calm down.

692
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,575
We ain't got no
goddamned pilot.

693
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,011
Not true.

694
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:57,534
The captain is injured,
but the copilot is fine.

695
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,753
I know we're gonna crashlike they did in Denver.

696
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,711
[inaudible]

697
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,148
Listen!

698
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:04,715
Listen, we don't know
what we're gonna crash.

699
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,762
Now, what we do know isthat someone on the ground

700
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,373
has found a way to take overthe plane's autopilot system.

701
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,375
So you're saying
the guy on the TV

702
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:13,507
has control of this plane.

703
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:14,421
Yes.

704
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,596
PASSENGER: Oh, no!

705
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,902
Listen.
Listen.

706
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:18,555
Listen.

707
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:21,950
Listen, these are not goingto stay that way for long.

708
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,344
Now, what I need to ask allof you is to remain calm.

709
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,259
The worst thing we
can do is panic.

710
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:30,437
I promise you, we will find away to land this plane safely.

711
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:31,873
[indistinct shouting]

712
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:49,673
Where's my husband?

713
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:50,718
He's fine.

714
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,502
He's tending to Captain O'Kelly.

715
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,982
How do we know he's
from the FAA, huh?

716
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,811
For all we know, he couldbe working with him.

717
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,247
He could be the onebringing this plane down.

718
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,510
Enough.

719
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,817
That guy risked his life
getting on this plane.

720
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:03,862
He's definitely here to help us.

721
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,135
Oh, Jesus.

722
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,049
How's Paul?

723
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,051
He'll be OK, right?

724
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:21,183
If we can get him to
the hospital, and that

725
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,707
means getting down.

726
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:25,492
Is that a wireless phone?

727
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:26,536
Yeah.

728
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,755
You can't use that.

729
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,061
Why not?

730
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:32,064
It'll disrupt the
navigational system.

731
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,543
Right.

732
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:34,414
OK.

733
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,420
[phone ringing]

734
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,464
Keller.
NEIL: It's Neil.

735
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:42,378
I'm on the--

736
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,032
Where the fuck are you?

737
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:45,468
We're in crisis mode here.

738
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,037
- I'm on Flight 672.
- Oh, my god.

739
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:50,212
That was you?

740
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,083
Turn on your com cam.

741
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,176
I was right, Sam.

742
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,481
I know you were.

743
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,092
How are you doing up there?

744
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,877
The passengers
are scared to death.

745
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:05,053
The captain has been
seriously injured too.

746
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,403
We've got to land thisthing as soon as possible.

747
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,492
All the avionics arebeing controlled by a guy

748
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,190
who calls himself Cain.

749
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,019
All air-to-groundcommunications are knocked out.

750
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,977
We're talking
radios, you name it.

751
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,761
The guy's wired the
cockpit for sound.

752
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,285
He can overhear
everything we say.

753
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:23,506
And plus, if we yank thechip, the engines shut down.

754
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,421
Does he have the
auxiliary systems too?

755
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,379
I think so.

756
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,510
But I'm not sure.

757
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,424
What does he want?

758
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:30,165
I don't know yet.

759
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,037
But as far as I know, this guy'scrashed three planes already

760
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,212
without asking for anything.

761
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:34,648
Well, he's got
to want something!

762
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,737
Unless he's a
total psychopath.

763
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:38,608
This guy's-- he's got
to have a background

764
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,393
in aviation computers.

765
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,569
You check and you see who'sworked on the entire systems,

766
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:44,092
and especially Oxcilis.

767
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,399
Can you access the
computer flight path?

768
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,966
We're trying to keep
the air clear for you.

769
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,142
But it would help if we knewwhere he was taking you.

770
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,404
I'll see what I can do.

771
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:52,318
Josie?

772
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,279
Can you find me a blankpiece of paper and something

773
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,237
to write with?
- Yeah.

774
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,151
Yeah.

775
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,543
Yeah.

776
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:03,851
And Neil, you broke
every rule in the book,

777
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,680
but I'm really glad
you're up there.

778
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,116
Marston?
MARSTON: Yes, sir?

779
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,291
Look at the
computer personnel,

780
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:10,640
starting with the
Oxcilis project.

781
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:11,990
Contact Quantico.

782
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,730
Get them cracking
on a psych profile.

783
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,429
What can we conclude about a guynamed Cain, first murdered, uh,

784
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,691
killed his brother.
Go, guys.

785
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:18,648
Let's go!We haven't that much time!

786
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,238
Perfect.

787
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,023
I'm sending the
coordinates to you now.

788
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,415
I don't recognize them.

789
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:49,027
But the longitude's
definitely East Coast.

790
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,550
That's not good, Neil.

791
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,986
The whole Eastern Seaboardis reporting severe wind

792
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,335
sheer and clear air turbulence.- Rock steady.

793
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,597
We'll get right back to you.

794
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:55,903
Just help us get down, OK?

795
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:04,216
How's he doing?

796
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,265
He's unconscious.

797
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,615
But he's OK.

798
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:16,010
How are you doing?

799
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:20,232
Me, I'm-- I'mconscious, but I'm not OK.

800
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:21,189
Doesn't seem that way to me.

801
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:26,064
I just--

802
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,762
I don't know how much longerI can keep it together.

803
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:30,068
You can.

804
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,026
You're doing a great job.

805
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:36,378
Thanks.

806
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,209
Today's supposed to
my last day at work.

807
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:45,822
Thought it'd be an easy flight.

808
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,172
[indistinct yelling]
WOMAN: Oh.

809
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:48,260
RAY: Let's go.
Get up.

810
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,522
Got to move.

811
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:51,654
WOMAN: Hey, quit
trying to take my seat.

812
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:53,613
RAY: No, you [inaudible].

813
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,093
[indistinct yelling]

814
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:59,271
See what I mean, easy.

815
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:02,796
I was the first class.

816
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:04,363
I should have the row back here.

817
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:05,755
Would you be quiet, please?

818
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,017
My son is trying to sleep.

819
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:07,931
What?

820
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,629
You are being an ass.

821
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,412
VARIOUS PASSENGERS: Yeah.WOMAN: Yeah, that's for sure.

822
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:11,283
Please be calm.

823
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:12,371
Just please be calm.

824
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,373
These seats are
way too small .

825
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:15,635
You got to do something.

826
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,158
I know we're in
a scary situation.

827
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,986
No, I'm in an
uncomfortable situation.

828
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,379
That's different.

829
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:22,903
I'm going back to first
class, where it's safer.

830
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,644
Ray, this is
not the "Titanic."

831
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,036
There aren't any lifeboats.

832
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,212
You want a row?

833
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,909
There's a private
row in the back.

834
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,867
[clapping and cheering]

835
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,573
So happy.

836
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,444
Hey, what's up, baby?
Don't I know you?

837
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:43,358
No.

838
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:46,318
My name's Ray.

839
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:48,276
Coordinates line up toCalvert Cliffs, Maryland.

840
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,713
What the hell is
in Calvert Cliffs?

841
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:55,631
Oh, my god.

842
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:01,028
You track it?

843
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,859
Neil Ferris McCabe,
Social Security, 343-4--

844
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,687
You know.

845
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,558
I know everything.

846
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,822
As a matter of fact, I justfinished draining your 401[k]

847
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:16,174
and registered you
as a sex offender

848
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:17,436
with your local law
enforcement agency.

849
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,393
Fuck you.

850
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,047
No, don't worry about it.

851
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,875
You're not gonna be aroundlong enough for any of this

852
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,659
to bother you.

853
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,446
Oh, and by the way, I wouldhave given you the coordinates.

854
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,143
All you had to do was ask.

855
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:33,234
[phone ringing]

856
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:34,496
What?

857
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:35,932
Hang up the
speakerphone, Neil, now.

858
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,154
What's going on?

859
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,938
He's taking you toCalvert Cliffs, Maryland.

860
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:45,812
Oh, Jesus.

861
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:54,124
Tell me you guys got aplan for this because, uh,

862
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,865
I'm drawing a blank right now.

863
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:57,780
You've got to find
a way to reroute it.

864
00:36:57,911 --> 00:36:59,826
[inaudible]---- he's
wired the cockpit.

865
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:02,089
He's monitoring everything I do.

866
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,221
Did you find
out what he wants?

867
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,787
He still hasn't
made any demands?

868
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,267
Nothing.

869
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,487
You got to get manual
control or reroute it.

870
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:09,488
It's up to you.

871
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:14,493
Shit.

872
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:25,591
Listen, if I cut the connectionbetween the hydraulics

873
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,201
and the chip, can
you land manually?

874
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:28,507
Are you kidding?

875
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:29,464
That's insane.

876
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:30,465
Listen, this is a crisis.

877
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,424
I realize that, all right?

878
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:34,948
The autopilot is essential, OK?

879
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,166
We've to cut it.

880
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,516
Listen to me.

881
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:39,300
The autopilot is not
a luxury, all right?

882
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:40,736
It's wired directly
to the hydraulics.

883
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:44,262
If you cut it, youalmost guarantee a crash.

884
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:47,265
All right.

885
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:48,657
We've got to alter
the land coordinates

886
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:49,658
without him knowing.

887
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,226
Well, where we are headed?

888
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:55,098
Baltimore area.

889
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,536
OK.

890
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:58,841
OK.

891
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,801
There's only one
option I can think of.

892
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,238
This is a particularly
nasty virus.

893
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,894
Now, if I can load this onto his computer, occupy him,

894
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:10,244
maybe it'll act
as a distraction.

895
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,115
And while he's
scrubbing his system,

896
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:16,119
you reset for Baltimore
International.

897
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,643
OK.

898
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,035
There's a jack you can useunderneath the cockpit.

899
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:19,993
JOSIE: I can take you there.

900
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,429
Great.

901
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,387
I need schematics.

902
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:23,301
Of course.

903
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,089
We're gonna make
this work, right?

904
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,047
Right.

905
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,571
The schematics.

906
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:33,615
[inaudible], thank you.

907
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:34,529
Good luck.

908
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,400
Come on.

909
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:40,230
How's he doing?

910
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,971
Still unconscious
but holding steady.

911
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,893
Cain might not
notice if we can go

912
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,373
in through an auxiliary jack.

913
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,853
There, it should beright behind the fuse box.

914
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,078
OK, ready?

915
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:02,992
Yep.

916
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,021
You got it?

917
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,023
You got it.

918
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:35,024
Should be up here.

919
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:35,938
OK.

920
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,026
[inaudible].

921
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,117
Is that it?

922
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:42,031
Yeah.

923
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:47,472
NEIL: Which one?

924
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:49,865
What do you mean which one?

925
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:51,345
There are two.

926
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:54,566
Which is the main?- Well, how should I know?

927
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:55,610
I'm not an engineer!

928
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:56,568
It's OK.

929
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:58,308
Just tell me what it says.

930
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,789
You know, I made plans
to start a business,

931
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,095
have a nice, stable life.

932
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,444
I mean, this was my
last day at work.

933
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:04,358
You told me.

934
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,012
Now just--

935
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:07,579
I don't like having thiskind of responsibility, OK?

936
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:08,928
I make the wrong
decision and people die.

937
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:10,059
Sh.
Sh.

938
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,973
Sh.

939
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:12,540
Take a deep breath.

940
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,760
Just tell me what is says.

941
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,588
OK.

942
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:22,332
Um, um, left is auxiliary one,and right says auxiliary two.

943
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:29,731
You decide.

944
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,043
Right-- use the
one on the right!

945
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,967
Got it.

946
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:50,448
Is it working?

947
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:51,449
Told you.

948
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:55,540
Stand by.

949
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,410
Roger.

950
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:01,676
Now.

951
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:08,988
It's working.

952
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:11,033
It's working.

953
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:13,862
We're reset for
Baltimore International.

954
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:16,822
We got it.

955
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:23,089
[whistling] Neil,
I give you an inch,

956
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,483
and you, you take a mile.

957
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:32,054
Do not, I repeat, do
not underestimate me.

958
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:33,969
I wrote the goddamn
Brethren virus

959
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,537
when you were still in diapers!

960
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:38,060
I'm disappointed in you.

961
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:39,497
And you know, Neil,
you're gonna have to do

962
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:40,889
a little better than that.

963
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,328
You have no idea who
you're fucking with!

964
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:49,811
You have no idea who
you are fucking with.

965
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:54,468
Campers, attention, campers,it appears that some people

966
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,253
are incapable of followingsimple instructions

967
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,995
and are trying to ruin
the fun for everyone.

968
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,693
So I'm gonna have to
teach you all a lesson.

969
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:02,650
I'm sorry.

970
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:06,654
Neil!

971
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:07,655
Hold on.

972
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:09,614
Brace yourself.

973
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,093
[screaming]

974
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:16,055
[inaudible]!

975
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,056
I got you.

976
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:24,977
[indistinct yelling]

977
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:36,510
It's too many Gs.
The plane can't take it.

978
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,033
[distant screaming]

979
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:42,211
It's amazing the limitsone can push [inaudible]..

980
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,691
[sobbing and crying]

981
00:42:57,879 --> 00:42:58,619
Ah!

982
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:04,582
[screaming]

983
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:10,588
[inaudible]

984
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,024
[screaming]

985
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:18,030
Stop crying, stop.

986
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,814
Sh.

987
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,337
Simmer.

988
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:22,208
Simmer.

989
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:23,252
Stop crying.

990
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:24,166
Stop.

991
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:25,124
Shh.

992
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:26,081
[inaudible]

993
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:27,996
Stop crying!

994
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,656
Because I have a very specialsurprise for all of you.

995
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:37,484
Now, don't tell anyone this.

996
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,312
But you're my favorites.

997
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:42,054
I mean, Honolulu,
you know, I just

998
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:46,449
dropped them into the Pacificwithout introducing myself.

999
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,364
And, yeah, I worked out
my kinks with Seattle.

1000
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,018
And Denver is something I--

1001
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,498
I always wanted to do.

1002
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,543
What's with this
crazy motherfuck?

1003
00:43:53,674 --> 00:44:00,638
The brilliance of flight672 will be the inspiration

1004
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:04,032
of miles of empty canvas.

1005
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:06,861
Songs will be written.

1006
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:10,038
And moves will be made.

1007
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:13,999
You're going down in ablazing, blast of history.

1008
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,788
What's he talking about?

1009
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:25,837
But I'm sure yourwhite knight from the FAA

1010
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:28,056
has already told
you all about that.

1011
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:32,104
Happy trails, campers.

1012
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:37,457
Where are we going?

1013
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:38,850
Believe me, you
don't want to know.

1014
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,025
No.
No, I do want to know.

1015
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:42,418
Where are we going?

1016
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:44,812
Calvert Cliffs, Maryland.

1017
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:48,294
Well, what's there?

1018
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,339
Largest nuclear reactor
on the East Coast.

1019
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,174
Gonna kills us all.

1020
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,219
Are you OK?

1021
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:01,960
Stay calm.

1022
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,222
Are you OK?

1023
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:04,571
I'm here.
I'm right here.

1024
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,528
I got to get out.

1025
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:06,399
I have to get out of here.

1026
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:07,443
He's gonna kill us!

1027
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:08,314
I swear to god.

1028

Hey, you OK?

1035
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,890

Please get out of here!

1037
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:20,848

What the fuck are you doing?

1047
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,689
We don't want you
to hurt yourself.

1048
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,212
[grunting and groaning]

1049
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:39,345
PANICKING MAN:

Ah!

1054

Excuse me.

1055
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:51,226
Excuse me, where
is he taking us?

1056
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:52,750
We're going to
land this plane.

1057
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,316
If you know something,I think it is your duty--

1058
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:55,361
[inaudible] should havecaught this in the last check.

1059
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:56,536
Hey!

00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,667
Where are you going?

1061
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:58,581
Check?

1062
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:00,235
What you talking about?

1063
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:01,584
FEMALE PASSENGER:
Where are you going?

1064
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:02,934
Excuse me!

1065
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:04,544
That Cain guy is
just crazy, understand?

1066
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,024
He's-- he's just sayingthings to make us all scared.

1067
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:07,416
Philip!

1068
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:08,330
WOMAN: What if it's

1069
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:09,592
BOY: Dad!

1070
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:10,898
You guys OK?

What are you talking about?

1075
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,558
We go into the Oxcilis systemevery six months for software

1076
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:20,603
upgrades and fine tuning,I guess-- some glitch

1077
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:21,822
specific to this type of plane.

1078
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,827
Shit.

1079
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,307
Do you know when this
plane last went in?

1080
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,221
Yeah.

1081
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:30,091
About a month ago.

1082
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:37,707
Ah, a little nervous
here, but I'm not

1083
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:39,144

Ow.
Ow.

1085
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:41,799
I think my arm's broken.

1086
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:42,974
It hurts.
Ow!

1087
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:43,844
Owie.

1088

[inaudible]

1089
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:56,378
You're not becoming
a good person, are you?

1090
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:58,859
Please, you know
me better than that.

1091
00:46:58,990 --> 00:46:59,860
All right, you'll be OK.

1092
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,079
WOMAN PASSENGER: Doctor?

1093
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,820
Doctor, we need
your help back here.

1094
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:03,821
Do you have to go, Dad?

1095
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,823
Do you?

1096
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:06,824
Go, Philip.

1097
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:09,696
It's what you do.

1098
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,653
Duty calls.

1099
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:13,918
I'll just go, hm?

1100
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,136
I think it's broken.

1101
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:16,485
- Let me have a look.
- Ow!

1102
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:17,356
Owie!
- Let me see.

1103
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:18,618
Let me see.
- Ow.

1104
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:21,099
Like I said, nice
fucking security.

1105
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:22,578
What are you getting at?

1106
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,058
I'll show you.

1107
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:26,974
Here's a list of
last month's checks.

1108
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:28,933
Now, this ID's the numberfor your plane, right?

1109
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,282
Right.

1110
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:31,457
I told you we were there.Wait a second.

1111
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:33,154
Hold on.

1112
00:47:33,285 --> 00:47:37,898
AV29367, that's the flightfrom Honolulu that crashed.

1113
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:39,030
Here's Denver.

1114
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,553
And there's Seattle.
Holy shit.

1115
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:41,467
Doc.

1116
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:44,731
Hey, doc, she's, uh--

1117
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,080
she hit her head back there.

1118
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,214
Do you think you could
come take a look?

1119
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:50,171
OK.
OK.

1120
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:51,085
OK.

1121
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:52,434
OK.

1122
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:53,522
You keep an eye on
the nervous breakdown.

1123
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:54,567
I'll take care of this.
- OK.

1124
00:47:57,613 --> 00:47:59,441
[computer sounds]

1125
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,662
Sam, I'm sending you--

1126
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,142
What the hell was
going on up there?

1127
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:05,578
You people were
all over the radar.

1128
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:06,753
That's putting it mildly.

1129
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,102
Listen, I'm emailing
you list now

1130
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,756
of planes that have been
in the Oxcilis group

1131
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,888
recently for fixes.

1132
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:12,498
You ground them all.

1133
00:48:12,628 --> 00:48:14,239
What are you talking about?

1134
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,676
Oxcilis brings in these planesevery six months for checks.

1135
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,808
The three planes that
crashed, and this one,

1136
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:20,332
were all in the
plant a month ago.

1137
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:21,855
Now--

1138
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:25,380
Neil, I got him,
Wilson Rundle.

1139
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:26,773
Way to go, Rudy.

1140
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,601
Worked writing code
in the Oxcilis project.

1141
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:29,994
Send him this info.

1142
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:31,299
OK, Neil, the consensus
is that this guy's

1143
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,301
a brilliant coder but crazy.

1144
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:35,956
He was badly burned in
a fire at the plant.

1145
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:38,654
Oxcilis gave him a big pay outprobably to keep him quiet.

1146
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,134
So he quietly
went away, knowing

1147
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:41,353
just when the planeswould be back in the plant

1148
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:42,267
and vulnerable.

1149
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:43,703
Looks that way.

1150
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,271
SAM: We'll get
right back to you.

1151
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:47,141
Paul.

1152
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:53,191
I'm right here, Paul.

1153
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:54,192
I can't feel my arms.

1154
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:57,064
It's a temporary paralysis.

1155
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:01,634
I'm sorry you won't beable to move for a while.

1156
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:03,549
Who's got control
of the plane?

1157
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,029
He still does.

1158
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,858
So I haven't seen my
dad for like two years.

1159
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,469
And, um-- and I
finally found him.

1160
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,299
And he had been in thehospital for a couple of weeks.

1161
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,214
And I-- and I justreally wanted to see him.

1162
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:19,521
[crying] I really wanted to--

1163
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,176
BOY: Dad, come back.

1164
00:49:22,307 --> 00:49:23,656
You'll see him, [inaudible].

1165
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,179
You'll see him.

1166
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,180
I want my dad.

1167
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:27,660
It's OK.
It's OK.

1168
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,661
Dad!

1169
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,446
Mama's here.

1170
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:32,491
Will you be OK?

1171
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:33,405
Dad, come back.

1172
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:34,362
Come back.

1173
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:35,363
It's OK.

1174
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:39,280
BOY: Dad!

1175
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:40,194
Dad!

1176
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:41,195
Oh, ma'am, I'm sorry.

1177
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,154
You really can't be up here.

1178
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,720
Nonsense.

1179
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:45,895
Go be with your family.

1180
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:47,027
I'll take over
from here, Doctor.

1181
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:48,333
BOY: Dad!

1182
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:51,292
Ma'am, this man is
seriously injured.

1183
00:49:51,423 --> 00:49:53,338
I need to be here.

1184
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:55,775
Your wife and son needs you.

1185
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:57,298
We don't have much time left.

1186
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:58,212
Go now.

1187
00:49:58,343 --> 00:49:59,648
Go be with them.

1188
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:04,566
BOY: Dad!

1189
00:50:04,697 --> 00:50:05,524
DR. PHILIP: Thank you.

1190
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,398
How are you feeling, Captain?

1191
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:11,443
I know you.

1192
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:12,313
You're a nurse.

1193
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,883
Not really.

1194
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,364
I just play one on TV.

1195
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,148
Ah.
Right.

1196
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,323
You're Bernadette DeCoer.

1197
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:27,328
You're on "Love
in the Afternoon."

1198
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:30,375
15 years, until theydecided I was too old to play

1199
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:32,594
the sexy love interest.

1200
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:34,118
Ah.

1201
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:38,470
I don't think you're
too old for all that.

1202
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,343
You will do just
fine, Captain.

1203
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,128
Papa's going to
stay right here, OK?

1204
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,044
BOY: I'm so glad
you're back Dad.

1205
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:56,879
Last known address was
right here in Chicago.

1206
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,709
I'm setting Rudy out witha SWAT team right now.

1207
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,928
Rock steady, Neil.

1208
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,321
We're coming down
the homestretch.

1209
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:05,323
Once we find Cain's
system, I'll link up

1210
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:09,240
you and Rudy to go do thatvoodoo that you do so well.

1211
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,591
Are you ready to
rumble, kemosabe?

1212
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:14,767
You better believe
it, chief, After all,

1213
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:16,638
it's a binary world, right?

1214
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:18,162
Yes or no, black or white.

1215
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:19,467
Yeah.

1216
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:21,556
Now you're talking.

1217
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:22,557
Let's do this.

But I'm not.

1242
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:03,832
The number you dialed
has been disconnected.

1243

Sit tight.

What do I want?

00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:47,659
I want my genius to berealized and for the world

1258

I want my place in history.

1260
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:58,365
But most of all, I
want to watch it burn.

1267
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,471
Oh shit!

[gunfire]

1269
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:21,432
[inaudible], up, please.

1270
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:23,434
Thank you.

1271
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,871
Oh, that's got to smart.

1272
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,351
[gunfire]

1273
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:31,311
[laughing]

1274
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:35,272
Jesus!

1275
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:48,720
That's your buddy Rudy!

1276
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:53,725
FBI AGENT: The whole
place is booby trapped.

1277
00:54:53,855 --> 00:54:56,162
Get me the hell out of here!

1278
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,163
Come on.

1279
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,121
[inaudible]

1280
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:01,123

[gasping]

1282
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:05,737
Access Road West should
get you out of here.

1283
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:07,913
Move it [inaudible], kemosabe.

1284
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:13,832
That's kemo.

1285
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:15,268
Come on, buddy, move it.

1286
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:17,226
Get your ass out of there.

1287
00:55:23,276 --> 00:55:24,756
What the hell do you want?

1288
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,149
[sputtering]

1289
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,673
Oh.

1290
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:29,630
Let's go.

1291
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:45,951
Maybe they'll find his teeth.

1292
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:52,914
You piece of shit.

1293
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:54,873
Ah, temper, temper.

1294
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:58,616
Neil, Rudy was a moron.

1295
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:00,922
I mean, really, I
did him a favor.

1296
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,402
You know the pain
you're causing.

1297
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,272
Pain?

1298
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:07,886
What do you know about pain?

1299
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,331
[indistinct exclamations]

1300
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:24,772
Are you afraid?

1301
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:29,386
Because you damn well better be.

1302
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:30,865
[grunting]

1303
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:31,866
WOMAN: Hey!

1304
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:32,780
No!

1305
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,347
MAN: Stop him!

1306
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:35,348
No!

1307
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,349
Don't!

1308
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,350
Don't!

1309
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,264
Let me go!

1310
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,352
Get out of my way!

1311
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,836
Let go of the door!

1312
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:46,315
[rush of air]

1315
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:51,277
Ah!

1316
00:56:56,456 --> 00:57:00,242
Looks like someone
lost their [inaudible]..

1317
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:02,244
[screaming]

1318
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:34,625
[screaming]

1319
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:35,582
Grab a strap.

1320
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,594
No!

1321
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:48,769
No!
No!

1322
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,857
Get it off!
No!

1323
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:51,293
No!

1324
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:53,557
This is supposed to
be my last night of work

1325
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:56,037
not my last night
on planet Earth.

1326
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,082
WOMAN: Help!

1327
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:59,519
We need help back here.

1328
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,999
BOY: No!

1329
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:02,522
No!

1330
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:03,436
No.

1331
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:04,350
Don't touch me!
No.

1332
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,264
Stop it!

1333
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:06,526
Get off!

1334
00:58:06,657 --> 00:58:07,571
Please, Tobaz,
keep this on, please.

1335
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:08,354
Keep it on.
- Yours first.

1336
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,573
Yours first.

1337
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:11,226
He won't [inaudible]
if you don't.

1338
00:58:11,357 --> 00:58:12,358
Here you go.
[inaudible] OK.

1339
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,272
It's all right.

1340
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,186
There you go.

1341
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:15,056
There you go.

1342
00:58:15,187 --> 00:58:16,057
It's all right.

1343
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:17,798
DR: PHILIP: Breathe.

1344
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,278
Help him.

1345
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:20,714
He was hit in the head.

1346
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,112
Breathe.

1347
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:32,509
Breathe.

1348
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,383
[gasping] Wh-- what happened?

1349
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,906
What are you talking about?

1350
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,125
This always happens in coach.

1351
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:46,784
[laughter turned to coughing]

1352
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,743
You can't-- that's
murdering US citizens.

1353
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:52,354
So is allowing that planeto crash into that plant.

1354
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:55,140
Look, Keller, I do not wantto shoot that plane down.

1355
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,750
Then give them more time.

1356
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,796
Call off the jets.

1357
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:01,538
All of my training, my
entire career and life

1358
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:04,671
have been devoted to protectingthis country and government.

1359
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:08,327
If I allow them to continue,I fail that mission.

1360
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:10,895
Give Neil a chance
to regain control.

1361
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:13,767
If what our special weaponsteam saw has any indication,

1362
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:15,943
Cain has everything covered.

1363
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:17,423
We don't know that for sure!

1364
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,339
Well, I know my
hands are tied!

1365
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:22,123
Once they reach
77-degrees longitude,

1366
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,734
I've got to take them down.

1367
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:33,831
We have to get to
a lower altitude,

1368
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:37,574
at least to 15,000
feet for the masks off.

1369
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,140
None of the controls respond.

1370
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:42,187
We don't have
enough oxygen. We

1371
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:43,971
burn through it
at this altitude,

1372
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,234
people are going to start dying!

1373
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:47,975
There's only one
thing I can think of.

1374
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,411
JOSIE: What?

1375
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:52,284
If I cut the connectionsbetween the chip

1376
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:55,548
and the major systems, wecontrol the plane manually.

1377
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:56,767
But if you cut
the connections,

1378
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:58,856
the engines
automatically shut off.

1379
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:01,902
We could restart themonce we have manual control.

1380
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,383
Manual control?

1381
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:07,038
Flying on of these thingsmanual is hard enough.

1382
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,518
Landing is next to impossible.

1383
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:12,260
If everything's perfect,10 to 1 you'd still crash,

1384
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:14,132
even with an experienced crew.

1385
01:00:14,262 --> 01:00:15,873
And I can't handle it!

1386
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:18,484
You could still get usdown, guide us through it.

1387
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:24,055
Is there any other option?

1388
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,491
There must be something.

1389
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,714
There's not another option.

1390
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:31,628
Let's do it.

1391
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,079
He's bringing us down.

1392
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:50,951
We're beginning our descent.

1393
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:57,088
Friends, countrymen,
lend me your ears.

1394
01:00:57,218 --> 01:01:00,395
Our journey is
drawing to a close.

1395
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:01,440
I'm sorry.

1396
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,963
I'm not very good at goodbyes.

1397
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,312
Don't worry.

1398
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:08,621
We'll-- we'll see
other soon-- in hell.

1399
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:11,624
It's Independence Day.

1400
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:15,715
You'll have just enough fuel toensure the greatest fireworks

1401
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:16,716
the world has ever seen.

1402
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:20,198
He's dumping fuel.

1403
01:01:20,328 --> 01:01:21,112
He's dumping fuel!

1404
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:28,293
[inaudible]

1405
01:01:28,423 --> 01:01:29,947
Why didn't you
tell us about this?

1406
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:31,470
We have a right to know.
- Would it have helped?

1407
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,645
BERNADETTE: We deserve
an explanation.

1408
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,081
I deal with what's
in front of me.

1409
01:01:34,212 --> 01:01:36,170
And what's in front of
me is a way out of this.

1410
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:40,392
Neil, you have to go downto the wiring compartment.

1411
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:42,437
Josie, move the
captain to the cockpit

1412
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:44,048
so he can see the readings.

1413
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:47,225
Now, tell me exactly whatI have to do down there.

1414
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:49,009
We need to keep contact
to a minimum in case

1415
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,663
Cain overhears us.

1416
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:54,623
OK, there are
three main components

1417
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:57,278
hooked into the
autopilot, the ailerons,

1418
01:01:57,409 --> 01:02:00,107
the elevator, and the rudder.

1419
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:04,068
Once you cut out all three,the engines will cut off.

1420
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:06,853
If we can restart,
we'll be in control.

1421
01:02:09,856 --> 01:02:11,858
You all need to be readyto take over the second I

1422
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,120
disconnect the wires.

1423
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,643
All right.

1424
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:17,777
Josie, Neil, there aretwo F-16s flying with us.

1425
01:02:17,908 --> 01:02:19,300
Is that good or bad?

1426
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:20,780
They could be here
to help us, right?

1427
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,742
I don't think so.

1428
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:29,093
OK, Neil, you need
to cut the red wire,

1429
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:32,574
then the black, then
the green, got it?

1430
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:35,012
Red, black, green.

1431
01:02:35,142 --> 01:02:35,926
OK, you guys.

1432
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,104
Sam, you can't do this!

1433
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,193
I'm trying to buy you
as much time as I can.

1434
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:43,411
Trying isn't
gonna cut it, Sam!

1435
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:46,458
You patch me through
to the pilots.

1436
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:49,417
Jesus, Neil, you
know I can't do that.

1437
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:51,593
77 degrees is the cut off.

1438
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:53,030
You got that?

1439
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,772
At your speed, you've
got about five minutes.

1440
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:58,687
You patch me through
to the pilots, Sam.

1441
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:00,689
There may be another
way out of this.

1442
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,039
Let me see what I can do.

1443
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:15,922
I'm in.

1444
01:03:16,053 --> 01:03:17,228

01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:21,406
FIGHTER JET PILOT:
1672, delta one-niner,

1447
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:23,103
do you read me, over?

1448
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,845
Delta one-niner, this is 672.

1449
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:27,586
Listen, you need to
give us some time.

1450
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:30,894
We're about to regainmanual control of the plane.

1451
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:32,591
I need more time.

1452
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:33,592
FIGHTER JET PILOT: On whoseauthority are you speaking?

1453
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:34,854
This isn't about authority!

1454
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,595
This isn't about what's right.

1455
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:39,816
You're about to shoot down aplaneload of American citizens.

1456
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:41,469
Sorry, 672, I have my orders.

1457
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,514
No.
No.

1458
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:43,994
Wait.
Wait.

1459
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:47,432
Listen, there's a chance
you can get out of this

1460
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:49,042
without blood on your hands.

1461
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:51,001
I'm gonna disconnect everythingand restart the engines.

1462
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,567
CAIN: Hey, Neil.

1463
01:03:52,698 --> 01:03:54,961
And just a few more minutesis all I'm asking for.

1464
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:59,270
FIGHTER JET PILOT: 672, youare 80 miles from kill zone.

1465
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,971
Neil, answer me.

1466
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:08,888
Neil, I need to talk to you!

1467
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:11,891
I'm right here, Cain.

1468
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:15,025
I'm feeling a little strange.

1469
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:17,549
We're feeling a
little strange too.

1470
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,029
You know the cabin's
depressurized.

1471
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:22,032
FIGHTER JET PILOT: 672,
70 miles from cut off.

1472
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:25,426
Two more minutes.Two more minutes, please.

1473
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:28,429
Hos did you lose a door, huh?

1474
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,301
You know, so I hope
you know I didn't

1475
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:32,694
have anything do with that.

1476
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:34,261
I wouldn't do
something like that.

1477
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:36,002
It's beneath me.

1478
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:37,743
People got scared.

1479
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,267
You got us all scared, Cain.

1480
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:41,312
Yeah.

1481
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:42,574
Yeah, I know.

1482
01:04:42,704 --> 01:04:44,271
That's what I've
been thinking about.

1483
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:49,494
FIGHTER JET PILOT: 672, you'reat 50 miles and counting.

1484
01:04:49,624 --> 01:04:52,149
Delta one-niner, I haveto end communication now.

1485
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:54,238
But I'm about to regain
control of the plane.

1486
01:04:54,368 --> 01:04:56,153
Two more minutes,
and these people

1487
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:59,199
have a real chance tosurvive this, over and out.

1488
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:01,158
I'm feeling something
[inaudible],, Neil.

1489
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:02,028

I don't know if what
I'm doing is right.

1494
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,093
I can't-- I can't stop seeingthe screaming faces melting.

1495
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,880
It's not too late to stop.

1496
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,709
Trust me, Neil, it's not fun.

1497
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,799

to get through.

1619
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:22,130
We did it, Sam.
We disconnected him.

1620
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:23,610
We're flying the plane manually.

1621
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:25,569
[cheering]

1622
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:27,614
We'll clear every
runway at Baltimore

1623
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:28,789
International for you.

1624
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,835
It's only 20 miles away.

1625
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:34,273
The navigational systemsare completely knocked out.

1626
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:37,450
When I say we're landing
manually, I mean it.

1627
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:40,018
Jesus.

1628
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,847
You got enough fuel to
hold out till daylight?

1629
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:44,849
Cain dumped most of it.

1630
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:47,721
And the fuel that we
do have is going fast.

1631
01:10:47,852 --> 01:10:50,724
We had to restart the engines,which knocked down about 20%

1632
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:52,639
of what was left.

1633
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,250
I'm unable to
operate the controls.

1634
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,383
So I'm gonna have to
walk Neil through it.

1635
01:10:57,514 --> 01:11:00,212
We're gonna do everythingwe can up here, Sam.

1636
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,867
Just make it as easy
in us as you can.

1637
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:04,434
You got it.

1638
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:06,131
Neil, there's a couple ofthings you need to know.

1639
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,308
First, we've grounded everyairplane equipped with Oxcilis.

1640
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,267
Good.

1641
01:11:11,397 --> 01:11:12,746
I got some bad news.

1642
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:15,662
I know about Rudy, Sam.

1643
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:17,098
I'm sorry.

1644
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:22,495
Sam, [inaudible] best.

1645
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:24,584
OK, you heard the man, people.

1646
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:25,716
Let's make it easy on him.

1647
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:28,109
Saddle up!

1648
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,547
DISPATCHER: All units
to runway three.

1649
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:33,071
Mobilize full resting
units to runway three.

1650
01:11:33,201 --> 01:11:34,812
GROUND CONTROL:
All inbound traffic

1651
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:37,728

1652
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,260
MAN: Move it!

1653
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,745
GROUND CONTROL [MALE
SPEAKER]: 1846,

1654
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,790
you are not clear for takeoff.

1655
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:57,791
Return to gate 17.

1656
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:02,579
GROUND CONTROL [FEMALE
SPEAKER0: Flight 733,

1657
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,843
reduce air speed
to do 2-5-0 knots.

1658
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:08,541
Cut right 0-1-5 and
divert to Dulles, over.

1659
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:09,803
GROUND CONTROL [MALE
SPEAKER]: All air

1660
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:10,978
traffic has been diverted.

1661
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:12,328
The runways are clear.

1662
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:13,241
All right, Neil.

1663
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:14,460
You are go for landing.

1664
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,114
Runways are clear?

1665
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,769
We've done everythingbut tear down the terminal.

1666
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:21,815
OK, just want to remind
you boys, we that land

1667
01:12:21,946 --> 01:12:24,731
using the ILS system
or radio beacons.

1668
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:27,038
It's visual all the way.

1669
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:28,605
OK, here's the plan.

1670
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:30,955
Circle around and beginyour descent toward runway

1671
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:32,522
two over the terminal.

1672
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:33,827
Over the terminal?

1673
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:34,915
Are you crazy?

1674
01:12:35,046 --> 01:12:36,874
We've evacuated it.

1675
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,179
Land in the opposite
direction, and you

1676
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,616
should have enough room.

1677
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:41,531
Doesn't that send us
directly into the Bay?

1678
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,968
There's an empty
field beyond runway two.

1679
01:12:44,098 --> 01:12:45,361
OK.

1680
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:47,450
You make sureeverybody's out of there.

1681
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,756
Because we run out of fuel,we're gonna be coasting in.

1682
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:51,192
Roger that.

1683
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:52,150
You're gonna make it, though.

1684
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:58,504
Ease back on the throttle.

1685
01:12:58,635 --> 01:12:59,940
Start taking us down.

1686
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,118
[bing]

1687
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:08,296
OK, folks, we're
gonna try to land.

1688
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:09,950
Now, I know we've
been through some hair

1689
01:13:10,081 --> 01:13:12,736
stuff here to put it mild.

1690
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:16,696
While I can't promise youthat the worst is over,

1691
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:18,959
I can promise you thatthose of us in this cockpit

1692
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:23,355
will do everything we can
to get you through this.

1693
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,225
See you on the ground.

1694
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,188
[sigh]

1695
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:36,412
One of you needs to
extend the flaps to slow

1696
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:39,327
us down for final approach.

1697
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,025
You got it?

1698
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:41,678
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: It's a blackswitch over on your right.

1699
01:13:41,808 --> 01:13:42,548
Yeah.

1700
01:13:48,206 --> 01:13:49,555
Flaps extending .

1701
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:50,513
Got it.

1702
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:55,169
[beeping]

1703
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,606
Christ, the flaps
didn't go down.

1704
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:59,391
CAPTAIN O'KELLY: Pull
on that [inaudible] now!

1705
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:01,437
Ah!

1706
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:05,702
GROUND CONTROL: 672
is losing altitude.

1707
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,617
[screaming]

1708
01:14:09,749 --> 01:14:11,098
Hold on!

1709
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:12,578
GROUND CONTROL: 672
is going to tank.

1710
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:14,058
They're going to crash.

1711
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:16,582
Get the flaps back up now!

1712
01:14:16,713 --> 01:14:17,453
Ah!

1713
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,770
Look at that!

1714
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:33,425
672 is back in the air!

1715
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:34,861
[crying]

1716
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:44,262
We're burning through fuel!

1717
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:45,350
Goddamn it.

1718
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,307
Talk to me, Neil.

1719
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:47,352
What's happening up there?

1720
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,267
One of our flaps is stuck.

1721
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,487
We can use one on each wing,but it's still not gonna get

1722
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:53,053
us down at an acceptable speed.

1723
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:55,665
And any second now we'regonna be running on fumes.

1724
01:14:55,795 --> 01:14:58,232
We're not gonna
pull this off, are we?

1725
01:15:01,322 --> 01:15:02,323
Keep it sturdy as you can.

1726
01:15:02,454 --> 01:15:05,979
Need to be lined up.

1727
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,677
There should be rows of
white lights down there.

1728
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:11,768
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1729
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:12,856
We're right in line.

1730
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:14,814
We're lined up.

1731
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:16,381
Are you ready for us?

1732
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,775
That's affirmative.

1733
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:20,820
God speed.

1734
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:22,213
Stead now.
I got it.

1735
01:15:22,343 --> 01:15:23,344
I got it.

1736
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:24,781
Can't get enough leverage.

1737
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:26,086
For Christ's sake
you're not gonna

1738
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:27,697
get any leverage if
you're splattered

1739
01:15:27,827 --> 01:15:28,872
all over the windshield.

1740
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:30,526
Control the levers
as best you can.

1741
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:32,223
Are we lowering
some of the flaps?

1742
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:33,790
CAPTAIN O'KELLY:
Yeah, one on each wing

1743
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,097
should slow us down some.

1744
01:15:37,228 --> 01:15:38,925
Use the rudder to line
us up with the runways.

1745
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:40,710
You swerve, and we're history.

1746
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,624
Stay focused.

1747
01:15:41,754 --> 01:15:43,147
We're out of fuel!

1748
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:44,104
Aw, let go of the throttle.

1749
01:15:44,235 --> 01:15:45,323
It doesn't matter anymore!

1750
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:46,542
Just use the rudder.

1751
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:50,415
And for God's sake,
keep us level!

1752
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,853
OK, lower the wheels.

1753
01:15:53,984 --> 01:15:54,811
Got it.

1754
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,818
They wheels are stuck!

1755
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:02,993
- Can we land?
- Should I pull up?

1756
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:04,037
Ah, it's too late goddamn it.

1757
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:05,343
But we can do it!

1758
01:16:05,473 --> 01:16:06,692
It won't be pretty,
but we can do it.

1759
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:08,172
GROUND CONTROL: 672,
land clear [inaudible]..

1760
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:09,042
Come on!

1761
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:15,962
Hold on!

1762
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:17,442
Oh, god.

1763
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,443
Hold on!

1764
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:29,846
[screaming]

1765
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:33,327
Hold it steady, Neil!

1766
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:34,807
Hold what steady?

1767
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,212
[screaming]

1768
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:58,135
[sirens]

1769
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,444
[crying and murmuring]

1770
01:17:03,575 --> 01:17:05,751
MAXINE: Everyone,
unfasten your seat belt

1771
01:17:05,882 --> 01:17:08,362
and slowly and calmly follow me.

1772
01:17:08,493 --> 01:17:09,755
[cheering]

1773
01:17:10,843 --> 01:17:11,844
That's just great.

1774
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,541
We did it.

1775
01:17:13,672 --> 01:17:15,195
GROUND CONTROL: 672 has landedand is safe on the ground!

1776
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:16,675
[cheering]

1777
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:21,332
We made it.

1778
01:17:21,462 --> 01:17:22,507
Josie!
Josie!

1779
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,464
Talk to me.
Josie!

1780
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:24,378
[sirens]

1781
01:17:24,509 --> 01:17:25,815
Thank you, Captain.

1782
01:17:33,213 --> 01:17:34,562
[sirens]

1783
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:37,391
[grunting]
- Oh, my side.

1784
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:38,479
Oh, you just
hang in there, OK?

1785
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,657
Help's gonna be on the way.

1786
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:42,832
We did.

1787
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:45,138
We made it through
the hard part.

1788
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:48,272
Everything's gonna be fine, OK?

1789
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,752
[sirens]

1790
01:17:52,885 --> 01:17:53,712
We did it.

1791
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:13,601
[sirens]

1792
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:24,874
Never again-- I am
never flying again.

1793
01:18:25,004 --> 01:18:27,180
Amen to that one.

1794
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:29,574
Listen, I've been
meaning to, you know,

1795
