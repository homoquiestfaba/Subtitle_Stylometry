Muscle pressure
from the cow,

75

Who knows.

365
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,438
Oh, shit!
Fuck, Mary!

366
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,606
<i>Mary!</i>

367
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:42,352
(Dan)
Hey, Tom.

368
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:43,521
Dan Reily.

369
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:45,423
The very man.

370
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:50,961
That your van
on the verge?

371
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:52,230
(Mary)
It is.

372
00:41:52,232 --> 00:41:54,632
A word, Dan,
if you please.

373
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:59,203
(Tom) <i>The knackers giving
you trouble, yeah?</i>

374
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:00,904
Oh, no, no, Tom.

375
00:42:00,906 --> 00:42:04,609
All right, Dan, but you be careful now.
You hear me?

376
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:05,910
That's all
right, Tom.

377
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:07,879
I said they could
stay a night or two.

378
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:10,381
It's your funeral, Dan,
you know how it goes.

379
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:13,051
Sure... what is there to
steal around here, Tom?

380
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:16,320
<i>It's a hard time,
all right.</i>

381
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:20,224
I hear that new fellow at the
bank's taking you all the way.

382
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:23,695
He's a right fecker
by all accounts.

383
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:25,529
Aye, he is.

384
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:28,432
You can't be messing around
with these boys, Dan.

385
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:32,669
They mean business. They'll have
you out, quick as you like,

386
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:35,207
they'll be 'round with
a sheaf of court orders

387
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,740
to bar you from
your own land.

388
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:40,244
Was there something
in particular, Tom?

389
00:42:40,246 --> 00:42:43,481
All right, Dan, just a bit
of advice, that's all.

390
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:48,553
I wanted to ask you if you
knew that Orla Buckley's car

391
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:51,321
is a mile up that lane
near O'Dwyer's Cross.

392
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:53,623
Orla?

393
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,459
It's a hell of a mess,
and we can't find her.

394
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:57,062
What do you mean
you can't find her?

395
00:42:57,064 --> 00:42:59,063
She didn't turn up
for work today.

396
00:42:59,065 --> 00:43:00,798
She was out here
last night,

397
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:03,867
she was lookin'
after a calf...

398
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:06,304
she...
she went back.

399
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:08,173
What time was it
you said she left?

400
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:10,540
I don't know.
It was late.

401
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:15,346
Fine. If you see her,
let me know.

402
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:18,984
You staying long?

403
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,651
Couple of days.

404
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:22,552
How many are you?

405
00:43:22,554 --> 00:43:25,021
Me, me Daddy,
and me sister.

406
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:27,358
There's a halting
site in Kilmartin.

407
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,828
It's all right, Tom, okay. I said
they could stay a night or two.

408
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,598
<i>I'd think of moving on there soon.
Maybe today. Maybe now.</i>

409
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:39,136
Good luck, Daniel.

410
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:43,106

I locked this

416
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:57,141
She came back?

417
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:01,713
She came back in the night
without telling me.

418
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:04,515
Don't go any closer!

419
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:09,453
We should leave it, the vet
said it could be infected.

She didn't look too
good when she left.

427
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:08,305
I don't know, like she had
a fever or something.

What's the
story here.

429
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:22,454
