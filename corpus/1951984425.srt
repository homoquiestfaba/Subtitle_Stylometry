1
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,607
<i>My mother always says</i>

2
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:15,741
<i>people are not fools.</i>

3
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:20,414
<i>Nobody chooses the Devil.</i>

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,457
<i>The Devil chooses you.</i>

5
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,515
<i>Come on, come on,
let's talk about this!</i>

6
00:00:24,593 --> 00:00:27,460
Open the door
or I'll break it down!

7
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,258
You're not gonna leave me, Patty!

8
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:31,356
<i>He choose my mother
the day she was born.</i>

9
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,007
<i>He didn't come
for her right away.</i>

10
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:46,912
<i>The way I see it,</i>

11
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:49,712
<i>he waited until Grandma Angie
gave in to her enraged father</i>

12
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,379
<i>and abandoned her baby on the
steps of St. Peter's Cathedral.</i>

13
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:10,327
<i>Actually, it was right after.</i>

14
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:15,770
<i>When Grandma Angie
decided to keep my mother</i>

15
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:18,074
<i>and wasn't allowed to come home.</i>

16
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,979
<i>That's when he knew my mother
was ripe for the taking.</i>

17
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,073
Here you go, folks.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,141
<i>All he had to do
was break her spirit.</i>

19
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:29,521
<i>Turns out that wasn't so easy.</i>

20
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,354
<i>No matter what he threw at her,</i>

21
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,223
<i>she came back swinging.</i>

22
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,098
We're late!

23
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,335
<i>Grandma Angie says that's
because my mother is a genius.</i>

24
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:47,933
<i>You find her a dumpster,
she'll make you a feast.</i>

25
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,203
How'd it go?

26
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,138
<i>So, growing a little impatient,</i>

27
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:56,207
<i>the Devil changed his strategy.</i>

28
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:59,048
This isn't a hotel, you know.

29
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,554
I see you.

30
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,988
Every night.

31
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:04,218
Don't you got someplace to go?

32
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,726
Are we under arrest?
No.

33
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,325
I brought you dinner.

34
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:18,763
<i>For the first time in her life,
something went right.</i>

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,274
<i>Now, it wasn't Romeo and Juliet,</i>

36
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:23,334
<i>but she was happy.</i>

37
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:24,401
Hey, babe.

38
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,844
<i>Joey was born, then me.</i>

39
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,905
Hi.

40
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,478
Is it good?

41
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:33,646
Hot.
Ooh, that's good.

42
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:35,656
<i>Careful.</i>

43
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:37,191
You all right?

44
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,521
Yeah, I'm okay, babe.

45
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,959
I'm fine.

46
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,623
<i>Then he knocked her flat.</i>

47
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,689
Patty!

48
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:54,933
<i>My father's cancer
took two years to kill him,</i>

49
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,774
<i>and all their savings.</i>

50
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,945
They towed the car.

51
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,043
Do you believe it?

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,111
And I couldn't even take the bus.

53
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,816
The bus driver said
to me I didn't have

54
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,983
enough change and I looked
at him and I said,

55
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,185
"My husband just died.

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,194
You can't give me a friggin' ride?"

57
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,127
<i>That's when he showed up.</i>

58
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:18,132
This is Mr. Russo.

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,724
From the funeral parlor.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,271
Mrs. Montanari, we offer
three packages: Deluxe,

61
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:31,904
Premium...

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,141
and Beloved.

63
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:36,844
Now, try not to think of them
as better or worse.

64
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,010
Do I have to pick now?

65
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,077
No, not at all.

66
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,521
I'm here to make this
as painless as possible.

67
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:43,956
If you'd like to call me,

68
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,289
think about it overnight and, uh...

69
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,295
let me know tomorrow, okay?

70
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:50,687
Thanks.

71
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:51,754
Oh! Jeez!

72
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,824
Ma!

73
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,164
I'll be fine.
Thank you very much.

74
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,932
At least let me take
care of your pants.

75
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:59,565
Mrs. Montanari, you have
enough on your plate.

76
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:02,610
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way down here for nothing.

77
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,201
I just, I can't think
straight right now.

78
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,268
No, I understand.

79
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,338
You loved him.

80
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,007
He gave me a sandwich.

81
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:14,886
It was the first time anybody
ever gave me anything.

82
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:22,019
I'm sorry for your loss, Patty.

83
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,819
You should probably speak up.

84
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,552
I don't think everybody heard you.

85
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,093
You want the ring?

86
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:54,788
You can have it.

87
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,797
In fact, if you give me a good price,

88
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,264
I'll throw in the pillow, too.

89
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,595
All right, guys, pay attention.

90
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,070
See this ring?

91
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,437
The idea is to keep an eye on the ring.

92
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,476
Here we go.
Put it under the middle cup.

93
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:45,741
Here we go.
Around and around she goes.

94
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:47,076
The idea's to watch the ring.

95
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,311
Where is... the ring?

96
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,977
No.

97
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,042
Try again.

98
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:54,588
It's in your pocket.

99
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:59,290
Not bad.

100
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,056
You're right.
In my pocket.

101
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,221
You're pretty sharp.

102
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,594
He's not my son for nothing.

103
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,668
I don't have it all.

104
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,070
That's okay.

105
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,199
Hold on to it for now.

106
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,743
<i>Call it a loan.</i>

107
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,836
I didn't ask for a loan.

108
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,244
Well, you might need it.

109
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:24,008
Thank you, anyway.

110
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,986
<i>Come on, boys.
Let's go find your grandma.</i>

111
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,602
You want to take the boys home?

112
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:48,472
- I'm going to get a few things.
- All right.

113
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:49,532
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

114
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,078
I'll see you at home.

115
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,205
Be good for your grandmother.

116
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:58,980
How are you holding up?

117
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:01,682
I'm so sorry about Dante.

118
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:02,745
Yeah.

119
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,054
Well, thank God he's not
in pain anymore, you know?

120
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:08,027
You're absolutely right.

121
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,394
He was a good man.
He shouldn't be suffering.

122
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,367
You know, Patty, what are we
going to do, you know? Life...

123
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,370
It's a crazy thing.

124
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,632
Okay.

125
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:20,038
Make it $25.

126
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,439
I'm going to pay you at the end
of the week, okay?

127
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:28,113
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

128
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:29,616
You know word gets around.

129
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,043
I'm so sorry...
No.

130
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,986
That's... It's okay.

131
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,950
You take care.

132
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,273
Hey!

133
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,438
Put it in sideways.

134
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,042
I knew that.

135
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:05,678
Hey, I got your cigarettes.

136
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,221
I didn't want to bring
them by the house

137
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:08,585
what with Dante being sick and all.

138
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,181
Yeah, I quit.

139
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,851
<i>Right. Cancer.</i>

140
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,326
I'm such a dope.

141
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:17,762
Well, that and I'm, uh, broke.

142
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,302
<i>Hey, come here.
Come on.</i>

143
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:22,927
- No, what are you doing...
- Come on take this.

144
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,437
- Let me help you out.
- Don't insult me.

145
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:26,940
- Please, please.
- All right.

146
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,566
Not for nothing.

147
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,941
<i>Come work for me.</i>

148
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,037
Nah. I can't break the law.

149
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,480
Think of it as a public service.

150
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,608
All those taxes.

151
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,675
How are we supposed
to smoke, huh?

152
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:47,925
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

153
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:50,692
Hey, Patty, you doing
Jimmy's route?

154
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:51,823
Hey!

155
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,834
Yeah, I am.

156
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,995
Huh. All right.
All right.

157
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,537
You know what?
Give me one of those.

158
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,766
I thought you quit.
I just changed my mind.

159
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,308
All right.

160
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:03,173
Oh, thanks, man.

161
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,212
No worries.
Take care.

162
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,867
I always knew I was a genius.

163
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,800
Face like yours,
I'm gonna double my sales.

164
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,033
There you go, babe.
Double?

165
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,131
I'd say that's a conservative estimate.

166
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:35,836
Frank, we... we were just...

167
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,207
I can see.

168
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,678
Nice hat.

169
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:40,907
It's very fetching.

170
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,108
Frank, this was a last-minute thing.

171
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,708
I swear to God, I didn't have
a chance to pass it by Bones yet.

172
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,686
You're a big man, Jimmy.

173
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,415
You don't need to tell me
everything you do.

174
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,820
Right.

175
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:52,860
Okay, then.
I'll, uh...

176
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,827
See you tomorrow.
Right.

177
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:58,826
What the hell was that about?

178
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,391
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

179
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:04,029
- You told me you don't need money.
- I don't.

180
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,573
Which is why you're wearing
an elf hat, moving stolen goods?

181
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:09,337
Oh, I don't do this for money,
I do this for fun.

182
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,106
- You should see what I do for money.
- You know you can go to jail for this?

183
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,704
Nobody goes to jail
for selling cigarettes.

184
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,545
Says who, the brain trust
who talked you into doing this?

185
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:19,143
What's he giving you,
ten cents a pack?

186
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,848
You always get so involved
in other people's personal business?

187
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:25,017
Ah, the world's got bigger things
in store for you, Mrs. Montanari.

188
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,425
Believe me.
That is very poetic.

189
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:31,989
<i>But at the moment, I got to make
Christmas happen for my kids.</i>

190
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,899
If you need a job,
come work for me.

191
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,095
At the funeral home?

192
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,933
I won't make you wear funny hats.

193
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,098
No, thanks.

194
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,231
I think I'll pass.

195
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,572
See, a lesser man might feel slighted.

196
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:46,478
A better man might look for other ways
to make an impression.

197
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,448
Merry Christmas.

198
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:58,384
Merry Christmas.

199
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,223
And, uh...

200
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,695
good luck with that elf thing.

201
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:05,198
I don't believe in luck.

202
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,996
Neither do I.

203
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,501
All right, no peeking.

204
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:13,768
One... two...

205
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,706
three!

206
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,538
Well, don't all shout at once.

207
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,878
But Joey said Santa wasn't coming.

208
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,645
I said "maybe."

209
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:26,551
Well, Santa always
comes for good boys.

210
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:27,747
Go ahead.

211
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,622
That's probably him now.

212
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,026
Wise guy.

213
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,432
Mrs. Montanari?
Yeah.

214
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,266
Special Agent Wolford. FBI.

215
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:46,399
Hi.
Hi.

216
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:48,101
I was hoping we could talk.

217
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,770
Talk... now... uh...

218
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:54,110
You know, it's not... it's not really a...

219
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,843
The house isn't... isn't...

220
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,646
I don't mind.

221
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,346
Uh, all right.

222
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,409
<i>Come on in.
Great.</i>

223
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:03,548
Uh, just right there,
to your right.

224
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,928
Tell me again, huh?

225
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,332
Where is it?
Ah!

226
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,929
I don't know!

227
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,633
I don't know, please.

228
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,572
The guards,
they took me in at the border.

229
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:22,870
They asked me questions.

230
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,878
When I came out, I drove away.

231
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,436
I pulled the car over straightaway.

232
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:29,210
There was no suitcase.

233
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,410
I swear on my kid's eyes, Carmine!

234
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,454
I swear!
On his eyes?

235
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,045
You swear, do you?
I swear!

236
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:37,489
Maybe I should open
your head up and check!

237
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:41,593
That's enough for now.

238
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,027
<i>Carmine...</i>

239
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,359
come here.

240
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,366
Give me that.
Okay.

241
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,664
You lying sack of...

242
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:51,432
Hey.
These are my boys.

243
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,098
Thanks, Ma.

244
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,977
So, uh...

245
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:59,104
you know, shouldn't you
be out celebrating?

246
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,340
Families?

247
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:03,873
Just tying up a few
loose ends, really.

248
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,584
Okay.

249
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:09,316
Rich, where's the money?

250
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,755
Frankie, I don't have it.

251
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,363
What am I supposed
to tell Palmeri?

252
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:17,420
That you lost it?

253
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:19,227
- I don't have it.
- I got a problem with that.

254
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,894
That's $500,000.

255
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,960
You want me to believe that
the border patrol got lucky,

256
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,027
is that what it is?

257
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:27,597
It's either that or somebody
tipped them off.

258
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,233
Who tipped them off, Richie?

259
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,971
Who tipped them off?
I didn't, Frank.

260
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,071
And if I find out it was you,

261
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,742
I'm going to drill
a hole in your brain,

262
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:38,843
then I'm going to drill
a hole in your heart,

263
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,480
then drill a hole
in each one of your eyes.

264
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,183
Now, if you'll excuse me,

265
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,749
I got to go open presents
with my family.

266
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:50,161
Bones, take him in the car out back.

267
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:51,698
What about the restaurant, Frank?

268
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,834
The restaurant?

269
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,338
Well, you just gave it to me, right?

270
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,642
Yeah.
What do you say?

271
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,735
Yeah, Merry Christmas, Frank.

272
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,507
Merry Christmas, Richie.

273
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,071
Yeah.
Let's go.

274
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,913
So, um, you know Jimmy Limo?

275
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:12,145
Yeah.

276
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,212
'Cause some people are saying
you guys might be working together.

277
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,278
Well, that's weird.

278
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,450
Maybe he didn't explain
some things to you, but, uh...

279
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,956
People who sell cigarettes
are required to pay taxes,

280
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,726
and not paying those taxes
is a federal offense

281
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,893
for which you can be put into prison.

282
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,664
Is that right?

283
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:30,726
Yeah, that's right.

284
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:33,330
Well, it's a good thing
I'm not working for him then, huh?

285
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,841
Okay.
All right.

286
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,276
Excellent.

287
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,110
May I?
Yeah.

288
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,313
Oh, jeez...
Oh, no, it's all right.

289
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,648
I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.

290
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,745
It's all right.
Oh, God.

291
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:48,982
I didn't really like it anyway.

292
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,887
Hey, listen.

293
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,983
You need to be careful, okay?

294
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,687
He's part of the Gambino family.

295
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:56,286
He works under Salvatore Palmeri.

296
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,031
He's in the Mob?

297
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:01,090
Yeah.

298
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,403
Okay...

299
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,043
Right here.

300
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:14,877
Take 'em out,
you put 'em right here.

301
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,042
All right, here we go.

302
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,107
Ooh!

303
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,483
Thank you.
I'll get them, lady.

304
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm going to help you, all right?
Let me help you.

305
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,089
Frank, we should have
done it right there,

306
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,186
before it comes back
and bites us in the ass.

307
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,254
We'll give it some time,
see how it plays out.

308
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,357
Okay, we'll give it some time.

309
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,934
What the hell is that?

310
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,432
Ho!

311
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:43,443
Ho! What are you doing?
Put those back.

312
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,001
Hey, put those back.

313
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,410
Put those back.
What the hell's this?

314
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,038
- Don't listen to him. Keep going.
- Put 'em back.

315
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,412
- You keep going.
- Who are you?

316
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,542
- Who am I? Who are you?
- Who am I? What are you...

317
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,984
These belong to Mr. Russo.

318
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:55,215
If he would like them moved,
he can come out here

319
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,847
- and do it himself.
- Are you out of your mind?

320
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,448
- Put that...
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

321
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,756
It's okay, just move this stuff
inside already, will you?

322
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,887
- Come on, let's get it off the sidewalk.
- All right, go.

323
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:05,125
Go. Move it. You heard him,
move it inside. Get in there.

324
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,757
You know what you are?

325
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,428
A bully. And a hypocrite.

326
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,061
<i>Calling the FBI to
keep me from selling</i>

327
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,436
a few cigarettes when
you do worse every day.

328
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,236
- You don't know what I do.
- Oh, no?

329
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,209
Tell me I'm wrong.

330
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:19,769
Tell me I'm wrong,
and I'll pack it all up and go home.

331
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,407
Jimmy Limo has been working
this neighborhood for 20 years.

332
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,008
No FBI agent ever come
to his house on Christmas Eve.

333
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,145
No, I was helping you
make smart choices,

334
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,621
but since you obviously aren't
capable of listening to reason,

335
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,987
maybe we need
to do something else.

336
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,650
You know what?
I don't respond to threats.

337
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:33,887
That wasn't a threat.

338
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:37,192
Trust me, if I threatened you,
you'd know.

339
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:39,256
You know what my mother says?

340
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,801
Never trust a man
who says to "trust me."

341
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:43,933
<i>Come with me.</i>

342
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:46,439
<i>- No.
- Come on. Come take a walk.</i>

343
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,804
I'm not going anywhere with you.

344
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,435
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

345
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,944
<i>Carmine, take care
of these guys, will you?</i>

346
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:55,676
Frank, I got it.
Hey, put me down right now!

347
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,513
Afternoon, Mr. Russo.

348
00:16:57,585 --> 00:17:00,645
- Hey, Merry Christmas, Tom.
- Oh, hi, Tom!

349
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,212
- And to you, too.
- You know Patty?

350
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,781
Put me down!

351
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,054
And you're embarrassing me.

352
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,857
Don't you ever do that again.

353
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:10,863
Take a look at this.

354
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:12,923
It's yours.

355
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,627
I want you to run it however you like.

356
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,432
All you have to do is pay me rent,
you pocket the profits.

357
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:18,699
Are you crazy?

358
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,934
You need a job,
I just acquired a piece of property.

359
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:21,997
You don't even know me.

360
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,600
But everybody deserves a chance.

361
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:26,772
I wouldn't work for you if you were
the last person on the planet.

362
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:27,836
I don't think that's true.

363
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:31,851
I think you do whatever it takes
to put food on the table.

364
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,685
And you're too smart to walk away
from the best opportunity you ever seen.

365
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:38,889
Am I right?

366
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,790
<i>In the end, he won.</i>

367
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,796
<i>The same way he wins every time.</i>

368
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,388
<i>Not with threats...</i>

369
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:46,524
No strings?

370
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,965
On my life.

371
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:49,229
<i>... with promises.</i>

372
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,770
Want to take a look, huh?

373
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,102
- Check it out?
- Don't you touch me.

374
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:02,213
Regrettably, the restaurant has run
into some financial difficulties.

375
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:04,751
Originally, I was going to close, but, uh,

376
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,946
after meeting Mrs. Montanari,

377
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,751
I became convinced
that a person with her visión...

378
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,018
Excuse me, Dad.

379
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:12,150
Not right now.

380
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,989
Dad, I need to talk to you.

381
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,158
We got heat.

382
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,392
I think the wife filed
a missing persons report.

383
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,298
You should come outside, okay?

384
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,927
- Okay. Good, son.
- No problem.

385
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:26,666
Uh, Mrs. Montanari,
would you care to finish?

386
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:31,636
Uh... okay.

387
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:36,149
Well, first of all,
you can call me Patty. Uh,

388
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,185
and I think that once we all
get to know each other,

389
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,379
we're going to have a really great...

390
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,285
time.

391
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,223
All right.

392
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,628
Well, I'm glad somebody
thinks that's funny.

393
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:52,257
Look, honey, I don't know
who you screwed to get this job,

394
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,358
but I'm telling you right now,
it's no prize.

395
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:56,995
And if the last guy
couldn't make it work,

396
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,631
well, then, uh...
you don't stand a chance.

397
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:03,165
Meanwhile,
you got a way to make rent?

398
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:09,204
How I pay my rent...
is none of your business.

399
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:12,184
My mistake.
The way we were talking,

400
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:15,984
I thought that maybe
we could be friends.

401
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:21,824
Well, my friends...

402
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,160
usually call me June.

403
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,459
Okay, here's the thing.

404
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,501
As long as you work for these goombahs,
you're doomed.

405
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,536
I mean, they're going
to show up one day with,

406
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,934
you know, a truckload of hijacked cows,

407
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,905
and, all of a sudden,
you're running a steak house.

408
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,463
The next day, shrimp.

409
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,170
Or some other thing you never
heard of and no one can eat.

410
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,836
Maybe I should make it a bar.

411
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:40,505
There are 15 bars on this street.

412
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,173
None of them have ever broken even.

413
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,615
You have a very negative attitude,
do you know that?

414
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,743
Well, I'm just saying that...

415
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,689
that these psychos are the only reason
this place ever stays open.

416
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,020
Well...

417
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:56,256
then I will just have to make it
successful enough to run on its own.

418
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,562
<i>Salud.</i>

419
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,799
You know, the place is an arm pit.

420
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,271
It never made nobody a nickel.

421
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,773
I say we burn it down.

422
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:10,310
We give the insurance money
to Palmeri, and that's it.

423
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,470
Yeah, well, maybe it needs
a fresh pair of eyes.

424
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,037
<i>Come on, Frank, we owe the guy
half a million bucks.</i>

425
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,345
This may not be the best time
to launch a, what,

426
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:18,908
culinary experiment, you know?

427
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,283
You're retarded. Listen, Frank.

428
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:23,187
I think maybe you're thinking
with the wrong part of your body.

429
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:24,588
Ho! With all due respect, boss.

430
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,922
I'm saying, what do you want
a broad in there for?

431
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,825
Her? I can think of a few reasons.

432
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,955
Hey, Jimmy, I'm serious.

433
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,499
I mean, don't we all get
enough trouble at home?

434
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,932
That's true.

435
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,435
- Point taken.
- Hey, no women in here.

436
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:37,869
Whoa!

437
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,872
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

438
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,407
I'm so glad I found you.

439
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,840
I have to show you this.

440
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,435
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, here we go.

441
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,071
They do a show in the Village.

442
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,842
It's sold out for months.

443
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,884
No way that's a guy.

444
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:54,819
- Why would you do that to yourself?
- I was thinking we could have one like it.

445
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:57,289
Frank,
we ain't running no gay bar.

446
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:59,792
The place in the Village
clears 10 grand a night.

447
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,054
Whoa.

448
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:04,120
Why don't we talk about this
over dinner?

449
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:09,102
Oh, no. Oh, no. I got to go.

450
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,160
<i>Come on, Nino.
That's your turn.</i>

451
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,729
Yeah, two.

452
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:16,298
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:18,607
I'm so sorry. Hi.

454
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,772
I'm so sorry, Sister Carolina.

455
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:23,180
Mrs. Montanari,
this isn't a baby-sitting service.

456
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,342
I know, I know.

457
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,851
It won't happen again, I promise.

458
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,717
Hi, boys.

459
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,723
So... how was everybody's day?

460
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,723
Okay, we'll talk about it at home.

461
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,695
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:38,732
It's a big job, you know?

463
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,266
And I'm still getting used to it.

464
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,199
Then why'd they give it to you?

465
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,964
Don't hold back.

466
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:46,506
I'm serious. You're a mother.

467
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:48,769
How'd you end up
running a nightclub?

468
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:49,968
Well, maybe I have talent.

469
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,774
You make good sandwiches.

470
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,245
All right, so we have two bars...

471
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:55,680
one here and one in the back

472
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,512
so nobody ever has to wait for drinks.

473
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,917
The dance floor is going
to be Brazilian mahogany.

474
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,251
It costs more, but it doesn't scratch.

475
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,757
Yeah, and what's, uh...
What's that back there?

476
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,417
Oh, that's a stage.

477
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,257
Get 'em thirsty
and keep 'em entertained.

478
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,164
Well, I should put you in charge
of my lots in Florida.

479
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:20,096
What do you think?

480
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:21,266
<i>Come on.</i>

481
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,207
- What?
- Come on. Let's dance.

482
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:24,437
No, I'm not dancing with you.

483
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,274
- Why not?
- Because, I...

484
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:28,110
Well, I don't know...
I don't know how to dance.

485
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,809
Well, you don't know
how to run a nightclub, either.

486
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:30,907
<i>Come on.</i>

487
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:32,919
What about your wife?

488
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,182
She doesn't like to dance.

489
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,018
Please?

490
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,082
All right.

491
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,492
<i>I just don't know how</i>

492
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:46,556
<i>Oh, girl</i>

493
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,399
<i>How I depend on you...</i>

494
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,301
- You all right?
- Yeah.

495
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:52,634
There you go.

496
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,936
<i>To give me love when I need it</i>

497
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,842
<i>Right on time
you would always be...</i>

498
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,845
I thought you didn't know how to dance.

499
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,904
I... I don't.

500
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,819
Whole new life.

501
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:12,181
Excuse me for interrupting.

502
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,223
<i>Come on in, Tom.</i>

503
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:19,697
Mr. Russo,

504
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,361
I just want to say I'm pleased

505
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,427
that this property
has come into your hands,

506
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,598
and I know that,
under your guidance,

507
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,938
we can expect nothing but greatness.

508
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,943
Wow.
This is for you.

509
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,273
Thanks, Tom.

510
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:33,608
Nothing but greatness.

511
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,615
Just, uh, one other thing.

512
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,173
The thing we talked about.

513
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,309
The kids on the corner.

514
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,012
Right. I took care of that.

515
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,021
All due respect, they're back.

516
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,488
Okay.

517
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:46,185
No criticism intended.
I just thought you should know.

518
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,751
None taken, Tom.
You know me better.

519
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,023
Thank you.

520
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,564
Bye, Tom.

521
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,759
Thank you, Mr. Russo.

522
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,128
The drugs,

523
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:01,436
they come down from Harlem
right out on the playground.

524
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:04,033
And you take care of it?

525
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:08,942
Do I make you nervous?

526
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:11,007
No.

527
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:14,714
'Cause you can walk away anytime.
No hard feelings.

528
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,552
No, I don't want to walk away.

529
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,149
Good. 'Cause neither do I.

530
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,256
It's nice.

531
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,473
- Come on, come on.
- Here.

532
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,476
Just make sure there's no water marks.

533
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,136
- You know?
- Don't hurt yourselves, hey, fellas.

534
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,737
Yeah, you wish.

535
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,782
Patty, sweetheart,
where do you want the booze?

536
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,478
Oh, uh, you could just put it
around the corner.

537
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:46,576
Trust me,

538
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,984
just keep your eyes on the audience.

539
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,080
If you don't take the pause,
you'll lose the effect.

540
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:51,419
What if there is no audience?

541
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,722
To see you?
What, are you kidding me?

542
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,819
- It's going to be a lynch mob in here.
- Hey!

543
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,124
I hope that's just an expression,

544
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,562
'cause otherwise,
we're in really big trouble.

545
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,327
<i>I made the chair, mook. Come on.</i>

546
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,425
There's, um, some guy at the back door.

547
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,528
Says he needs to talk to you.

548
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:05,572
Oh. All right.

549
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,607
- Hey.
- Hi.

550
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,732
I went by your house,

551
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,276
and your mother said
you were here, so...

552
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:13,575
Um...
so you work here or...

553
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:15,239
In a way.

554
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,010
- Oh.
- Yeah.

555
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:19,143
Wow, huh?

556
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,187
Yeah. Wow.

557
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,883
That's Frank for you, huh?
Always taking risks.

558
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,390
Not like Palmeri, though.

559
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,290
I think he's...
he's a bit more old-fashioned.

560
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:28,623
I wouldn't know.

561
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,788
And now Frank owes him
all this money, and...

562
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,957
Well, the word is
Frank's on pretty thin ice,

563
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,127
and if this place doesn't fly...

564
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,366
I don't know what to tell you.

565
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,637
Is that why you came here?

566
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,303
Actually, no, it's not.

567
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,971
Um...

568
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,950
You didn't have to do that.

569
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:53,009
Oh, it's nothing.

570
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,955
Hey, good luck tonight, okay?

571
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:58,914
Oh...

572
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,960
Tell Frank I said hi.

573
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,725
That's good there.

574
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,901
Not bad, huh?

575
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,841
No.

576
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,143
Not bad.

577
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,151
Never would've believed it.

578
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,210
All we need is people.

579
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,616
Holy moley.

580
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:32,249
What?

581
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,021
You look nice, Patty.

582
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,086
Thanks, Jimmy.

583
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:40,133
I'm going to go check outside.

584
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,764
Hey.

585
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,901
Shut your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

586
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,629
Hey, Patty, good luck.

587
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:12,961
<i>My grandmother was calling
my mother a genius</i>

588
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,625
<i>before I was born.</i>

589
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,794
<i>I took it as a matter of fact.</i>

590
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,134
<i>To me, she was a force of nature,</i>

591
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:21,902
<i>like a bolt of lightning,
gathering heat,</i>

592
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,966
<i>waiting to strike.</i>

593
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,110
<i>This was her night.</i>

594
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:30,479
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

595
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,075
How do you breathe in that dress?

596
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,053
<i>The whole Gambino family showed up.</i>

597
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:37,090
<i>Benny Marino, Canarsie.</i>

598
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,148
<i>Fredo Rossi, Sheepshead Bay.</i>

599
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:41,217
<i>The under boss, Vito Giordano.</i>

600
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:45,197
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

601
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:46,892
- Oh, you've done good.
- Oh, thanks.

602
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,935
<i>Maron.</i>

603
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,300
<i>Even the Boss of Bosses,</i>

604
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,532
<i>Salvatore Palmeri.</i>

605
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:54,835
Who's that guy?

606
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,136
Relax, it's Sal.

607
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:59,269
<i>They didn't know why they came.</i>

608
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,338
<i>But they knew it was a mistake
to stay away.</i>

609
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,213
It means we're a hit.

610
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:08,879
You hope.

611
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,322
- Mary, my wife.
- Hi.

612
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,722
Normally, I wouldn't come,

613
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:15,660
but this I had to see
with my own eyes.

614
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:16,957
Thank you.

615
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,021
Let's go say hi to Sal, huh?

616
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,839
Ladies and gentlemen,

617
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:36,109
welcome to Pandora's Box,

618
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:41,177
the box you shouldn't open
unless you want to play.

619
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,523
<i>- What you want
- Ooh</i>

620
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,591
<i>- Baby, I got it
- Ooh...</i>

621
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,102
<i>- What you need
- Ooh</i>

622
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,694
<i>Do you know I got it</i>

623
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,637
<i>- Ooh
- All I'm askin'</i>

624
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:04,143
<i>Is for a little respect
when you come home</i>

625
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:05,701
<i>- Just a little bit
- Hey, baby</i>

626
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,838
<i>- Just a little bit
- When you get home</i>

627
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,108
<i>Just a little bit...</i>

628
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,548
Frank only wants what he can't get.

629
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,586
That's when he's at his best.

630
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:15,780
<i>I won't do you wrong
while you're gone</i>

631
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:18,654
<i>- Ain't gonna do you wrong
- Ooh</i>

632
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:20,124
<i>- 'Cause I don't wanna
- Ooh...</i>

633
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,491
<i>- All I'm askin'
- Ooh</i>

634
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:24,587
<i>Is for a little respect</i>

635
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:25,995
<i>- When you come home
- Just a little bit</i>

636
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,397
<i>- Baby
- Just a little bit</i>

637
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,662
<i>- When you get home
- Just a little bit</i>

638
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:32,364
<i>- Yeah
- Just a little bit</i>

639
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,750
<i>- Ooh, your kisses
- Ooh</i>

640
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,816
<i>- Sweeter than honey
- Ooh</i>

641
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,020
<i>And guess what</i>

642
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,892
<i>- Ooh
- So is my money</i>

643
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,261
<i>- Ooh...
- All I want you</i>

644
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:01,027
<i>To do for me
is give it to me</i>

645
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,092
<i>- When you get home
- Re, re, re, re</i>

646
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,432
<i>- Yeah, baby
- Re, re, re</i>

647
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:05,698
<i>- Whip it to me</i>

648
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:07,535
<i>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</i>

649
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,598
<i>Find out what it means to me</i>

650
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,701
<i>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</i>

651
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:14,338
<i>Take care, TCB</i>

652
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,441
Whose idea was this?

653
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,758
Hey, Patty.

654
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,569
I just got the reviews,
hot off the press.

655
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:17,439
Word is out: We're a hit.

656
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:18,944
That's great.

657
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:20,912
- I'm very happy for you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

658
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:22,073
You're going to freeze to death.

659
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,138
Put this on.

660
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,986
<i>Come on,
I'll give you a ride.</i>

661
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,487
No, that's all right.

662
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,148
I'm going to walk.

663
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,782
What do you mean
you're going to walk?

664
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,851
You're going to walk
six blocks in the cold?

665
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:38,296
What am I supposed to do?

666
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,798
I'm not gonna chase you, Patty.

667
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:52,036
What the hell is all that?

668
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,205
You take off,
you walk away with my jacket.

669
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,044
I thought I was working for you.

670
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:57,208
You are.
And Palmeri?

671
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,752
Is that why you've been
avoiding me all night?

672
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,877
Do you owe him money?

673
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,216
- Who told you that?
- People talk.

674
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,225
Yeah, well, they say a lot
more than they know.

675
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,056
You are not working for him.

676
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:09,720
He's just... He's admiring.

677
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:14,065
Okay, well, I don't want him
there every night...

678
00:32:14,134 --> 00:32:15,726
you know, acting like he owns
the place.

679
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:17,633
Do you want to kiss me?

680
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:19,672
I'm going crazy.

681
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:22,207
It's all I think about,
all the time.

682
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,440
That's one hell of a line.

683
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:29,379
You didn't answer
my question.

684
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:17,893
I just don't want them
at the club every night.

685
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,516
You should probably leave,

686
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:18,853
because the boys are going
to be up soon, for school.

687
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,196
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

688
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,000
Frank!

689
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,200
Hey, Vito.

690
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,243
Good morning.

691
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:41,241
What's up?

692
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,474
Well, Mr. Palmeri would like you

693
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:44,710
to come into his office
so you can talk, you know?

694
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:46,081
Okay, I'll be right there.

695
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,119
No, no, no.

696
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,121
Mrs. Montanari.

697
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:50,622
Me?

698
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,487
Yeah.

699
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,361
Tell him I got to get
my kids to school.

700
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,727
Are you out of your mind?

701
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:02,995
I'm not making them late

702
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:04,900
because some self-important
thug wants to talk.

703
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,598
Look, you don't say no
to Palmeri.

704
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:08,800
What's he going to do,
shoot me for packing lunch?

705
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,536
I've seen people die for less.

706
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:14,072
Look, just tell Vito
that you're going to go.

707
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,177
I, um, just wanted
to see for myself

708
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:26,020
how busy a person could be
not to accept an invitation.

709
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:32,425
I... I take it that, uh,
you know who I am.

710
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:33,989
Yeah.

711
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,160
And I assume

712
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,726
you know of some of what I do.

713
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:39,567
Some.

714
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,369
Why do you work for me?

715
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,381
I mean, why not, uh,
you know, uh...

716
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,441
a waitress,
a secretary, a nurse?

717
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,578
Those jobs don't have perks.

718
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,246
Oh...

719
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,222
Who is this big shot?

720
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,620
- Ma, take the kids.
- And do what?

721
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:02,592
Make breakfast.

722
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,061
But her eggs are runny.

723
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,190
Excuse me for
one second, okay?

724
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,565
Listen to me.

725
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:10,796
You will eat those eggs

726
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,928
and you will not complain.

727
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:12,972
Do you hear me?

728
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,199
But they make me sick.

729
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,741
All right, zip it.

730
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,770
I'm sorry.

731
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,040
No, no, no, uh...

732
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:23,742
Nothing should come between
a mother and her sons.

733
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,809
Good, good.
Um...

734
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:32,347
I have some, uh, business
interests in Canada,

735
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,484
and I would like for you

736
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:37,257
to, uh, collect the dividends
once a month.

737
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,423
What kind of dividends?

738
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:41,057
$500,000.

739
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:44,433
I would need for you to get it
across the border

740
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:46,563
without anybody finding it.

741
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,766
That sounds very dangerous.

742
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,173
<i>Could be.</i>

743
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:51,733
Well, in that case,

744
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:53,836
wouldn't it be smarter to use
someone with bigger shoulders?

745
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:57,212
You know, I could also use
an armored car,

746
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:59,979
but that might attract
a lot of attention.

747
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:03,853
So let me get this straight.

748
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:07,358
Even though we've just met,

749
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,918
you trust me more
than an armored car.

750
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:13,159
Well, I was, um...
quite impressed

751
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,133
what you did with
the broken-down diner,

752
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:18,364
and, uh, I'm willing
to take the risk.

753
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,598
What if I'm not?

754
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,105
Well, you'd be well compensated.

755
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:24,007
It costs more than you could
afford to replace a mother.

756
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:27,171
Yeah, that's for sure.

757
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:30,410
However, if you should
decide to do this,

758
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:33,281
I would guarantee you
and your entire family, uh,

759
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:36,049
would be taken of
for the rest of their lives.

760
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,750
And, believe me, I would
never have asked you

761
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:41,316
if I didn't think you could do it.

762
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,057
What do you think?

763
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:53,063
It's your decision.

764
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,405
Look, I, um...

765
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,639
I've never pushed anybody
into a job

766
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:01,873
that they didn't want,

767
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:05,315
and I very much respect
your decision.

768
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:07,983
I didn't make a decision.

769
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:13,491
I'll do it once,
see how it feels.

770
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,154
Then I'll make my decision.

771
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:18,060
Good.

772
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:33,302
What was that?

773
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,539
What was what?

774
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:35,979
That thing you
were doing with him.

775
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:37,414
I don't know what
you're talking about.

776
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,508
I'm talking about the way
you were acting with Sal...

777
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:40,610
like it was a private
conversation.

778
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,177
We were making
a business arrangement.

779
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:43,654
What, you think
you can play him?

780
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:45,884
You can't play him, Patty.
He's playing you.

781
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,119
You're acting like a baby.

782
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:48,956
Do you know what
you have to do?

783
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:50,586
You know what
he asked you to do?

784
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,257
Yes, he asked me to drive to Canada
and pick up some money.

785
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,891
Yeah, these guys are
not like us, Patty.

786
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,902
They're Sicilian.
They don't work with women.

787
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,096
You try and take their money,

788
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,638
you're gonna end up
in the drink.

789
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:02,266
And if not, you still got
to make it past the border.

790
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,900
So it's okay that I work for you?

791
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,774
Look, Patty, the last guy
that went up there,

792
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:09,337
he lost $500,000,
now he's dead.

793
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:12,950
You want to go up there?

794
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,646
Why didn't you say anything?

795
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:16,416
I was looking right at you!

796
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:18,650
I said to you,
"Frank, what do you think?"

797
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,818
'Cause it's not my place
to say no for you.

798
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,451
Why would I say no?

799
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,553
The guy promised
to take care of my kids

800
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:27,566
for the rest of their lives.

801
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:32,396
Then take this.

802
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,199
Get that out of here.

803
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:36,366
No... if you're gonna go,

804
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:39,275
take it; if not, don't go.

805
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:53,087
<i>The easy way to explain things</i>

806
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,456
<i>is that my mother was bullied,</i>

807
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:57,087
<i>or tricked, or even
backed into a corner.</i>

808
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:59,097
<i>But it wouldn't be true.</i>

809
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:03,067
<i>She walked in of her own free
will with her eyes wide open.</i>

810
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,934
<i>And she'd be the first to say it.</i>

811
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,917
How long are you going?

812
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:24,956
Uh, just a few days.

813
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,254
I'll be back before you know it.

814
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:30,659
If I were you,
I'd take the bullets.

815
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:57,256
Right through here.

816
00:40:57,323 --> 00:40:59,883
Watch your step.

817
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,064
<i>Don't be afraid.
Come on in.</i>

818
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,231
Straight ahead.

819
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,814
Around the corner here.

820
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:30,918
Straight ahead.

821
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,252
Around the corner.

822
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:34,487
Here, you can wait right here.

823
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:47,230
Seven out.

824
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,850
Watch your step.

825
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:14,899
...Patty...

826
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:30,440
Okay, the part,
I understood.

827
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:31,915
It's not very nice.

828
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,781
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

829
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,845
I also think you said
something about $400,000

830
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:39,153
instead of $500,000.

831
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:41,887
You give me the $500,000

832
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:44,361
and I will let you keep
your family jewels.

833
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,180
<i>What you want</i>

834
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,375
<i>Baby, I got</i>

835
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,474
<i>What you need</i>

836
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:06,916
<i>You know I got it</i>

837
00:43:06,986 --> 00:43:09,181
<i>All I'm asking...</i>

838
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:10,449
Somebody's having fun.

839
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:13,117
Somebody had
a very nice vacation.

840
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:15,692
Turn off the music, ma'am.

841
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,161
Let me see some I.D.

842
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:19,528
Sure.

843
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:26,237
Here you go.

844
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,367
<i>Could you pop the trunk?</i>

845
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:32,206
Uh, can we skip it?

846
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:34,508
I did a lot of shopping,
and I promised the boys

847
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,980
that I'd be home in time
to make pancakes.

848
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,916
Pop the trunk, please.

849
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:42,454
Yeah.

850
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:29,001
You did good.

851
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:31,161
Well, I told you.

852
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:33,762
The exchange rate
is very favorable.

853
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,431
Have a nice day.

854
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:36,497
You, too.

855
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:50,154
<i>My mother makes no excuses</i>

856
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:51,814
<i>for the choices she made.</i>

857
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:53,654
<i>But she would also say,</i>

858
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:55,990
<i>don't be too quick to assume
you wouldn't make them, too.</i>

859
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,503
What are you doing?

860
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,097
<i>What are you doing?</i>

861
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:10,665
Is that real?

862
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:13,211
Why aren't you in school?

863
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:14,746
Grandma went shopping.

864
00:45:14,814 --> 00:45:15,838
She went shopping?

865
00:45:15,915 --> 00:45:17,507
She said there was a sale.

866
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,517
She needed
to get there early.

867
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:21,416
Okay, the two of you,
you just wait right there.

868
00:45:21,487 --> 00:45:23,614
I'm going to go change
and I'm taking you to school.

869
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:25,020
Okay.

870
00:45:25,091 --> 00:45:27,082
Hey!

871
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,693
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

872
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,161
Are those for us?

873
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,356
I don't know.

874
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:33,762
Is your name Nino?

875
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,999
Yeah, go ahead.

876
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,560
<i>Come on, I'll take you.</i>

877
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:41,299
100 bucks says you can't
beat me to school.

878
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:42,932
What are you going
to do with $100?

879
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,199
Out of my way.

880
00:45:45,277 --> 00:45:48,872
Coming through, coming through.

881
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:54,317
What'd you do that for?

882
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:55,979
I don't know.

883
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:57,181
Maybe to, uh,

884
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,520
correct a misimpression
I might have left

885
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:00,923
last time we were together.

886
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:03,553
Which would be?

887
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:05,256
That I was a small-minded,

888
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:08,391
old-fashioned,
jealous sort of person

889
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:10,833
who could underestimate
the capabilities

890
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:12,837
of the woman he loves.

891
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:16,402
I don't think she came to that conclusion.

892
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:18,773
She didn't?

893
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:20,334
No.

894
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:24,577
I think she was just really happy
you were here when she got home.

895
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,414
<i>Come on, get on.
Get on!</i>

896
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,787
- We got to beat these kids to school.
- All right, all right.

897
00:46:33,926 --> 00:46:35,791
That's it, that's it.
Watch your feet.

898
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,020
We're coming, fellas!

899
00:47:19,538 --> 00:47:20,562
<i>Six years later,</i>

900
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:22,300
<i>and my mother was
as tight with the Mob</i>

901
00:47:22,374 --> 00:47:23,898
<i>as if she were a made guy.</i>

902
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:25,136
<i>She was involved
in loan-sharking</i>

903
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:27,145
<i>and ran crap games
all over Brooklyn.</i>

904
00:47:27,213 --> 00:47:30,182
<i>Between the nightclub
and her collections in Canada,</i>

905
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:31,682
<i>she earned enough money
to move us</i>

906
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,479
<i>from an apartment
on Flatbush Avenue</i>

907
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,179
<i>to a townhouse
in Prospect Park,</i>

908
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:38,690
<i>and helped Frank pay off the
half mil he owed Sal Palmeri.</i>

909
00:47:38,757 --> 00:47:40,850
<i>\Where's that Parmesan?</i>

910
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:43,019
<i>But it wasn't for power or money.</i>

911
00:47:43,095 --> 00:47:45,086
<i>The reason she did it was family...</i>

912
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:50,328
<i>You've done me wrong</i>

913
00:47:50,402 --> 00:47:52,461
<i>... a bigger, more devoted
family than she had ever known.</i>

914
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:54,506
<i>- You took a sip
- Just a sip</i>

915
00:47:54,573 --> 00:47:57,007
<i>From the Devil's cup</i>

916
00:47:57,076 --> 00:47:58,771
<i>These guys showed up
for everything...</i>

917
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:00,709
<i>Uncle Al, Uncle Tito,</i>

918
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:02,644
<i>Uncle Jimmy, Uncle Bones,</i>

919
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:04,273
<i>Uncle Carmine.</i>

920
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,342
<i>Just who do you think you are</i>

921
00:48:08,754 --> 00:48:11,188
<i>Stop acting like
some kind of star</i>

922
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:12,519
Not so fast.

923
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,525
This is for college.

924
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:16,561
Home in an hour.

925
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:19,564
<i>And that was just
the immediate family.</i>

926
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:22,567
<i>There was also Eddie and Mikey,
Jackie and Vic.</i>

927
00:48:22,635 --> 00:48:24,159
<i>Even the cops.</i>

928
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:26,830
<i>So many guys on the take it
made you wonder who wasn't.</i>

929
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:28,897
<i>Breaking the law was just
the price they all paid</i>

930
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:30,908
<i>to be part of things.</i>

931
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:32,409
Hey, Patty...

932
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:34,412
you, uh, see a gold
cuff link anywhere?

933
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,674
No, sorry.

934
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:37,215
Hey, Frank.

935
00:48:37,283 --> 00:48:39,376
My wife is going
to slit my throat.

936
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:40,748
I'll keep my eye out.

937
00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:42,446
Thanks.

938
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:44,916
- Hi, June.
- Sorry we're late.

939
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,287
Someone forgot a present,

940
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:48,588
so I said I wouldn't
show up empty-handed.

941
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:49,923
Oh, you're sweet.
Thank you.

942
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:51,485
Joey, take this,
put this on the table.

943
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:52,895
- Patty.
- How you doing?

944
00:48:52,965 --> 00:48:54,899
- Sorry, I need a drink.
- That's all right.

945
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:56,332
Now... now I'm a coat rack?

946
00:48:56,402 --> 00:48:57,960
Yeah...

947
00:48:58,037 --> 00:48:59,595
What's going on with the wig?

948
00:48:59,672 --> 00:49:01,105
Eh, she got it Third Street.

949
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:02,504
Oh.

950
00:49:02,575 --> 00:49:05,738
Hey, listen, um, here's a little
something for the boy.

951
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:06,869
Oh, Sal.

952
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:07,913
Oh, Patty.

953
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,210
<i>Come on, he's like a son to me.
Buy him a car.</i>

954
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,214
First he goes to college.

955
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,307
No, he doesn't need college.

956
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:13,316
He's got me.

957
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:16,683
You know something,

958
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:18,746
if I was a little less honorable, uh,

959
00:49:18,824 --> 00:49:20,086
I'd have taken Frank out

960
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,717
the first day I laid eyes on you.

961
00:49:21,794 --> 00:49:23,625
If you were
a more honorable guy...

962
00:49:23,696 --> 00:49:25,129
Hey, be nice.

963
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:26,221
Okay? Relax.

964
00:49:26,298 --> 00:49:28,198
Take a breath and get
the look off your face.

965
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:29,234
What look, Sal?

966
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:31,292
Be nice, tough guy.

967
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:34,329
I apologize, Sal.

968
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:35,668
All right.
All right.

969
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:37,140
Enough about honor.

970
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,609
Go make a plate, and you
take this for me, okay.

971
00:49:39,678 --> 00:49:41,612
Thank you for coming, Sal.

972
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,238
Thank you.

973
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:44,577
<i>They broke the law,</i>

974
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,550
<i>but they owned the neighborhood.</i>

975
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:48,553
<i>Joey never bought it,</i>

976
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:51,920
<i>but from where I sat,
it seemed like a pretty good trade.</i>

977
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:53,959
<i>The part I didn't get</i>

978
00:49:54,026 --> 00:49:56,256
<i>was that we were all paying a price:</i>

979
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,228
<i>Me...</i>

980
00:49:58,297 --> 00:49:59,662
<i>Mouse...</i>

981
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:01,825
<i>even the innocent bystanders,</i>

982
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,868
<i>- Hey, Mouse!
- like the guy who sold us groceries.</i>

983
00:50:03,936 --> 00:50:06,200
Want to see something?

984
00:50:06,272 --> 00:50:08,206
Nino?

985
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:10,265
Nino...

986
00:50:11,877 --> 00:50:13,811
You shouldn't be here.

987
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:16,643
Get out of here.

988
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:43,297
Mr. Gallo?

989
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:54,614
Hey!

990
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,348
We tried to find out what
he was doing there,

991
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:00,449
and he clamped right up.

992
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:02,118
Kept on saying, however,

993
00:51:02,194 --> 00:51:04,128
that he was a friend of yours,

994
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:06,130
and that's all we could get.

995
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:08,723
I've been a friend
of the Montanari family

996
00:51:08,801 --> 00:51:11,326
for many years.

997
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:17,165
He had this in his pocket.

998
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:21,337
Of course he wouldn't
say where it came from.

999
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:25,173
I'd like to know...

1000
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:28,176
...how he found that body.

1001
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,416
Hmm?

1002
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:43,567
Watch your fingers.

1003
00:51:43,635 --> 00:51:46,570
What the hell were
you doing out there?

1004
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:48,196
Answer me, Nino.

1005
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:49,706
What were you doing
out there?

1006
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:50,707
Nothing.

1007
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:52,073
A dead body is not nothing.

1008
00:51:52,144 --> 00:51:54,339
And don't you ever
use my name with the police.

1009
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:55,573
What's the matter with you?

1010
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:56,773
You know those guys.

1011
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:58,009
Say they do favors for you.

1012
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,051
You want me to go to jail
for the rest of my life?

1013
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:01,916
- Is that what you want?
- All right, all right.

1014
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:03,648
Did you steal Carmine's cuff links?

1015
00:52:03,722 --> 00:52:06,247
You steal.

1016
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:07,485
I'm telling you, Nino,

1017
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,924
I'm telling you right now,

1018
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:10,621
if I get caught up
in this mess,

1019
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:11,924
I'm going to kick your ass.

1020
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:13,965
You lay one hand on my kid,

1021
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:15,465
and I will cut it off.

1022
00:52:15,534 --> 00:52:17,161
It's for his own good.

1023
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:24,773
How did you know
about the body?

1024
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:30,772
I don't want you
taking risks like that.

1025
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:35,783
Why did he die?

1026
00:52:38,924 --> 00:52:40,858
I'm not sure.

1027
00:52:49,268 --> 00:52:53,034
I didn't take those, by the way.
Just for the record.

1028
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:55,938
It must seem kind of strange,

1029
00:52:56,008 --> 00:52:57,976
me asking to see you
after all these years.

1030
00:52:58,043 --> 00:53:00,034
I'm glad you did.

1031
00:53:02,014 --> 00:53:03,948
My son got in trouble
the other day.

1032
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:05,040
Yeah, I know.

1033
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:06,277
He's a good kid.

1034
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:07,943
I'm sure he is.

1035
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,955
Well, I was just hoping that...

1036
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:13,457
maybe you can keep an eye out,

1037
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:15,959
and let me know if there's
something I should know.

1038
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:17,461
Sure.

1039
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,121
Really?
Yeah, absolutely.

1040
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:20,290
Oh, that's great.

1041
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:22,299
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1042
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,698
I appreciate it.

1043
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:25,236
Hey, Patty.

1044
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:27,670
That grocer, Gallo...
He was a friend of yours, right?

1045
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,764
Well, I wouldn't say
he was a friend.

1046
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:31,810
- He was my grocer.
- Right.

1047
00:53:31,877 --> 00:53:33,276
You know why he was murdered?

1048
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:34,937
No.

1049
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:37,174
Yeah.
He got into it with some kid,

1050
00:53:37,249 --> 00:53:40,184
selling drugs out front
of his store.

1051
00:53:40,252 --> 00:53:41,844
Oh...

1052
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,353
No, that's impossible.

1053
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,617
They don't sell drugs.

1054
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:47,852
Looks like Mouse is selling to me.
What do you think?

1055
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:53,395
Well, I mean, if he is,
Frank doesn't know about it.

1056
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:55,399
They're liars, Patty.

1057
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:56,866
They are liars,
and they're killers.

1058
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:58,960
That's how they get by.

1059
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:04,271
Frank!

1060
00:54:04,343 --> 00:54:05,571
Where is he?
Is he here?

1061
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:06,941
- He's upstairs in the apartment.
- Frank!

1062
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:08,639
Hey, what's going on?

1063
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:10,682
- What are you doing here?
- Where's your son?

1064
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,309
- Hey, you know better to come to my...
- He's a drug dealer, Frank!

1065
00:54:13,385 --> 00:54:15,444
- What are you talking about?
- I need him to stay away...

1066
00:54:15,521 --> 00:54:16,988
Hey, we're in the middle
of dinner here.

1067
00:54:17,055 --> 00:54:19,615
- You stay away from my kid!
- Hey, hey. Hold on second, hey!

1068
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:20,783
- He's garbage!
- Will you control yourself?

1069
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:21,985
Do not come near my son!

1070
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,459
- Take it easy.
- He's a drug dealer!

1071
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:25,087
Your son.

1072
00:54:25,163 --> 00:54:26,960
Selling drugs to kids
in our neighborhood.

1073
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:27,999
She's lying.

1074
00:54:28,066 --> 00:54:28,998
I saw pictures...

1075
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,261
FBI surveillance...

1076
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:31,768
of him at the grocery store.

1077
00:54:31,837 --> 00:54:33,099
Pictures?
How'd you see pictures?

1078
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:34,365
They brought me in
for questioning.

1079
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,805
He's all over them.

1080
00:54:39,278 --> 00:54:41,371
- Are you selling?
- No.

1081
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,676
Did you hear what she just said?

1082
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:45,011
Yeah, I heard.
She doesn't know...

1083
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,847
- They got pictures, you understand?
- Yeah, but, Dad...

1084
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:52,751
- Frank!
- I told you.

1085
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:54,621
I told you to come to me.

1086
00:54:54,693 --> 00:54:57,594
I told you!
What's wrong with you?

1087
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:01,527
There's one thing
you had to do...

1088
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,434
just one thing... is stay clean.

1089
00:55:05,504 --> 00:55:06,732
Just one thing!

1090
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:08,602
Stay clean.
That's all I ever asked of you.

1091
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:09,902
- Frank, let him go.
- I'm sorry.

1092
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:11,340
- No. Where were you?
- Enough, enough.

1093
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,401
Where were you?
You're supposed to keep an eye on him.

1094
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:14,775
- You keep telling me he's clean.
- Enough!

1095
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:16,837
Enough for now!

1096
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:18,507
You be quiet.

1097
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:22,350
How dare you come here
like you got the right.

1098
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:24,912
It's not enough,
your fancy apartment, your fancy car,

1099
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,457
my husband
seven nights a week?

1100
00:55:26,525 --> 00:55:28,220
Get the hell out of my house.

1101
00:55:28,293 --> 00:55:29,590
Patty, go home.

1102
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:31,322
Get out!

1103
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:37,533
<i>Once you start paying attention,</i>

1104
00:55:37,603 --> 00:55:40,094
<i>change happens very fast.</i>

1105
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:42,504
<i>You see evidence
everywhere you turn,:</i>

1106
00:55:42,574 --> 00:55:45,975
<i>Signs you've been missing
for weeks, maybe years.</i>

1107
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:49,275
<i>No place is safe,
not even your own home.</i>

1108
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,976
<i>Every act of kindness hides a threat,</i>

1109
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,952
<i>every friend becomes an enemy.</i>

1110
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:04,524
<i>There's no one to turn to,
and no going back.</i>

1111
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:09,363
<i>The deed is done,
your soul is sold.</i>

1112
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:12,335
So, Patty, you're heading up
to Canada, right?

1113
00:56:12,404 --> 00:56:13,598
Uh, yeah.

1114
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:15,970
I'm actually leaving
in about an hour.

1115
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,202
Sal wants you to take June.

1116
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:19,868
June?

1117
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:21,970
She's getting a little jumpy
from all the attention.

1118
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,378
He needs to distract her.

1119
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,416
Is he crazy?
I can't take June.

1120
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:27,679
It's one time.

1121
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:29,550
Two girls on a shopping trip.
You'll be fine.

1122
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:31,782
Do you know how many
times I say that?

1123
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:33,290
"I'll be fine."

1124
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:34,985
And then I throw up.

1125
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,857
Don't get all dramatic
on me, honey.

1126
00:56:36,928 --> 00:56:38,657
No, Jimmy.

1127
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,061
I'm serious.

1128
00:56:40,132 --> 00:56:42,362
I can't... I can't keep doing this.

1129
00:56:42,434 --> 00:56:44,299
I got to get out.

1130
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:46,837
I got to take my kids
and move someplace safe.

1131
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,998
Nobody gets out.

1132
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:51,008
We're like a retirement home...

1133
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:53,203
you just get old,
and then you die.

1134
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:54,973
Simple as that.

1135
00:56:55,047 --> 00:56:57,038
It's a good life.

1136
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,950
15 agents,
right outside my house.

1137
00:57:03,021 --> 00:57:04,249
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1138
00:57:04,322 --> 00:57:06,381
Haven't had fun in,
like, three days.

1139
00:57:07,793 --> 00:57:10,227
So who was this guy, anyway?

1140
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:12,195
A grocer.

1141
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:14,994
Oh, God, you would've thought
he was the G.D. Pope.

1142
00:57:16,134 --> 00:57:19,365
June, what are you
doing to yourself?

1143
00:57:20,439 --> 00:57:22,134
- What?
- What? What?

1144
00:57:22,207 --> 00:57:23,731
The coke.
What do you think?

1145
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:26,073
I'm just trying to have
a little fun, all right?

1146
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:28,305
Well, you're gonna, you're gonna
have to throw that stuff away

1147
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,540
before we get to the border.

1148
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,083
I'm not throwing this out.

1149
00:57:33,151 --> 00:57:34,641
Yeah, you are, June.

1150
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,210
No, I'm not.

1151
00:57:36,288 --> 00:57:38,153
Okay, look, we're going
to the border.

1152
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:39,815
I'm trying to have fun
on this trip.

1153
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:41,017
I haven't had any fun.

1154
00:57:41,093 --> 00:57:42,890
Will you just let me
have some fun?

1155
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:44,394
What are you doing?
What...

1156
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,056
Here's another one for you.

1157
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:50,328
Let's try this.

1158
00:57:50,402 --> 00:57:52,996
Oh, yes.

1159
00:57:55,273 --> 00:57:59,903
Oh... oh...

1160
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:01,240
Ooh, I will take it.

1161
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:02,337
Oh, good.

1162
00:58:02,414 --> 00:58:04,143
I'll wrap it up for you.

1163
00:58:04,216 --> 00:58:06,343
It is nice, you have to admit.

1164
00:58:12,724 --> 00:58:14,749
Who the hell is that guy?

1165
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:16,088
I saw him at the border.

1166
00:58:16,161 --> 00:58:18,026
<i>Could I get whacked
for fooling around?</i>

1167
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:19,893
- I gotta go.
- Now?

1168
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:22,456
Listen, just pay for the coat

1169
00:58:22,534 --> 00:58:23,967
and meet me at the hotel.

1170
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:26,162
Do me a favor,
do not talk to that guy.

1171
00:58:26,238 --> 00:58:27,170
But I haven't...

1172
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:29,104
Don't talk to him.

1173
00:58:34,479 --> 00:58:36,538
How about some hats?

1174
00:58:57,402 --> 00:58:58,391
An agent?

1175
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,994
Yeah, trying to look like tourist.

1176
00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:02,266
Or maybe he was a tourist.

1177
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,240
I think he followed me
across the border.

1178
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:06,174
That's a pretty active imagination.

1179
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:09,008
All right, just give me the money
so I can get out of here.

1180
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,638
You're early.

1181
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:11,977
Montreal doesn't deliver till tomorrow.

1182
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,848
Okay, then give me what you got.

1183
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,951
Do you want to call Sal
or should I?

1184
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:34,870
I knew it was a mistake
to use a broad.

1185
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,601
You should get out.

1186
00:59:36,675 --> 00:59:39,007
You should think about
a helping profession.

1187
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:40,510
Like nursing.

1188
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,772
Police!

1189
00:59:48,286 --> 00:59:50,049
Freeze!

1190
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:51,179
Hands on the counter!

1191
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,715
- Where's the money?
- What money?

1192
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:56,317
Wrong answer!

1193
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:58,259
Keep an eye on her.

1194
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,389
Let's go.

1195
01:00:00,465 --> 01:00:02,899
Ma'am, are you okay?

1196
01:00:02,968 --> 01:00:04,902
I think I'm going
to throw up.

1197
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,030
- Uh...
- Is there a bathroom?

1198
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:09,767
This way.

1199
01:00:17,215 --> 01:00:19,809
- Right here.
- Okay.

1200
01:00:53,852 --> 01:00:55,479
What the hell's going on?

1201
01:00:55,553 --> 01:00:56,485
Where is she?

1202
01:00:56,554 --> 01:00:57,680
She's in the washroom.

1203
01:00:57,756 --> 01:00:59,246
Are you out of your mind?

1204
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,620
There's another door!

1205
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:11,269
Where the hell have you been?
I'm bored out of my mind.

1206
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:12,803
- Get dressed.
- We better be going

1207
01:01:12,871 --> 01:01:14,805
- somewhere nice for dinner.
- We're checking out.

1208
01:01:14,873 --> 01:01:15,862
Dressed?

1209
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:26,106
Are we in trouble?

1210
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:28,277
We can't go back together.

1211
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:29,911
I need you
to carry the money.

1212
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:31,819
I can't.

1213
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,551
Oh, yes, you can.

1214
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:35,320
You're gonna take these,

1215
01:01:35,393 --> 01:01:36,883
you're gonna wrap
the money to your body,

1216
01:01:36,962 --> 01:01:38,930
and then you're gonna put
your clothes on over it.

1217
01:01:38,997 --> 01:01:40,965
I've done it 50 times;
nobody's ever caught me.

1218
01:01:41,032 --> 01:01:42,465
Once you get
across the border,

1219
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:44,263
go to your apartment,

1220
01:01:44,336 --> 01:01:47,271
and then... and then call me
at the club, all right?

1221
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:49,307
No, I'm not kidding,
Patty, okay? I can't.

1222
01:01:49,374 --> 01:01:50,602
I'll go crazy,

1223
01:01:50,675 --> 01:01:52,973
or I'll start crying
or some crap like that.

1224
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:54,875
- I mean, they'll arrest me, and then...
- Listen to me.

1225
01:01:54,946 --> 01:01:58,040
I don't have time for this.

1226
01:01:58,116 --> 01:02:00,914
If we don't get that money home,

1227
01:02:00,986 --> 01:02:03,784
we're both dead.

1228
01:02:07,425 --> 01:02:10,155
Okay.

1229
01:02:10,228 --> 01:02:13,994
Okay, we're gonna be okay.

1230
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:23,673
- Any day.
- Gin.

1231
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:24,970
What do you mean gin?

1232
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:27,511
What are you doing? Come on.

1233
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:29,069
Gin.

1234
01:02:29,147 --> 01:02:31,138
- Get out of here.
- What are you talking about?

1235
01:02:31,216 --> 01:02:33,013
- That is gin.
- It means I win.

1236
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:34,346
No, it means you cheat.

1237
01:02:34,419 --> 01:02:36,011
I do not cheat.
How does he get gin?

1238
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:37,577
I do not cheat.

1239
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:39,748
Hey, hello to you, too.

1240
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:41,553
- Hey, Patty, how are you?
- Hey, Patty.

1241
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:42,854
You're early.

1242
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:45,589
Something came up.

1243
01:02:45,663 --> 01:02:47,096
Deal me out.

1244
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:48,723
All right, I'm dealer.
Who's dealer, me?

1245
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,392
Yeah, do it.

1246
01:02:50,468 --> 01:02:52,368
What do you mean
something came up?

1247
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:54,098
They got busted.

1248
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:56,436
Busted how?

1249
01:02:56,508 --> 01:02:58,567
Hey, Patty, how did you slip the G?

1250
01:03:01,546 --> 01:03:02,945
What happened to the money?

1251
01:03:03,014 --> 01:03:04,242
June has it.

1252
01:03:04,315 --> 01:03:06,510
You gave the money to June?

1253
01:03:06,584 --> 01:03:10,577
Yeah, I don't know if you've noticed,
but there's FBI agents everywhere we go.

1254
01:03:10,655 --> 01:03:11,781
Where is she?

1255
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,016
She's on her way home.

1256
01:03:13,091 --> 01:03:14,183
Then why aren't you with her?

1257
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:16,386
I'm waiting here for her to call me.

1258
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:19,487
No, no, you don't wait here.
You stay with her.

1259
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:22,032
And you sit on the steps
all day, if you have to.

1260
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,227
You know what, Frank?
Don't tell me what to do.

1261
01:03:24,302 --> 01:03:25,428
While you're waiting here,

1262
01:03:25,503 --> 01:03:28,438
she's helping herself to the cash
and keeping up with her drug habit.

1263
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:31,202
You know what? I been doing this
for six years without your help.

1264
01:03:31,276 --> 01:03:33,369
Is that what you want me to tell Sal?

1265
01:03:33,445 --> 01:03:36,278
No, you know what?
You can tell Sal to go to hell.

1266
01:03:36,347 --> 01:03:38,577
<i>Hey, Frankie, take it easy. Come on.</i>

1267
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,208
What?

1268
01:03:40,285 --> 01:03:41,582
It's not her fault.

1269
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:42,745
Excuse me?

1270
01:03:42,821 --> 01:03:44,789
It's not her fault.

1271
01:03:46,691 --> 01:03:50,525
Did I ask your opinion, Bones?
Did I?

1272
01:03:58,136 --> 01:04:00,764
What?

1273
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:23,859
Oh, my God.
Sweetie, what happened to you?

1274
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:26,692
My father, he was a little upset.

1275
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:27,890
<i>Can I come in, Patty?</i>

1276
01:04:27,966 --> 01:04:30,560
Yeah, yeah, come in.

1277
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:35,103
Oh...

1278
01:04:35,173 --> 01:04:36,470
I'm in trouble, Patty.

1279
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,600
I think Palmeri's going to kill me.

1280
01:04:38,676 --> 01:04:41,167
No, no. Nobody's going to kill you.

1281
01:04:41,246 --> 01:04:42,645
It's my fault.

1282
01:04:42,714 --> 01:04:45,808
The drugs... Gallo...

1283
01:04:45,884 --> 01:04:48,284
the Feds tightening up on us.

1284
01:04:48,353 --> 01:04:50,583
Why would Palmeri
be afraid of the Feds?

1285
01:04:50,655 --> 01:04:53,715
I don't know.
I was hoping you could talk to him,

1286
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:57,022
remind him how much my father
does for the family.

1287
01:04:57,095 --> 01:04:59,893
Sweetie, I think it'll sound better
coming from your father.

1288
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,725
I don't have much pull
with him right now.

1289
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:05,393
Look, he was upset

1290
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:09,236
because he loves you
and he cares about you.

1291
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:12,105
Okay, go to him. He'll help you.

1292
01:05:12,177 --> 01:05:13,667
Yeah, sure.

1293
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:17,046
Okay.

1294
01:05:21,819 --> 01:05:24,481
I never meant
to get Nino in trouble.

1295
01:05:24,556 --> 01:05:26,046
I'm sorry, Patty.

1296
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:27,785
It's okay.

1297
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:46,243
Don't you ever backtalk me
in front of my crew.

1298
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:49,007
Like you got me
on some kind of leash.

1299
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,138
Did you beat up Mouse?

1300
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:52,809
You did, didn't ya?

1301
01:05:52,884 --> 01:05:55,409
Kicked him like a dog,
your own son.

1302
01:05:55,486 --> 01:05:59,217
You know, you're beginning
to sound like my wife.

1303
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,622
Frank, he's scared.
He thinks Sal's gonna kill him.

1304
01:06:01,693 --> 01:06:02,717
Well, maybe he's right.

1305
01:06:02,794 --> 01:06:04,159
Well, then you need
to do something.

1306
01:06:04,229 --> 01:06:06,254
Yeah? What do you want me to do?
You tell me.

1307
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:07,593
Go to Sal!

1308
01:06:07,665 --> 01:06:10,156
Why you keep talking
about Mouse?

1309
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:13,830
Because he came here asking
for help, Frank.

1310
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:20,607
Mouse came here?

1311
01:06:20,678 --> 01:06:22,168
Why would he come to you?

1312
01:06:22,247 --> 01:06:24,875
Because instead of acting
like his father, you beat him up.

1313
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:27,042
Well, tell me something.

1314
01:06:27,118 --> 01:06:28,847
Is there something going on
between you two?

1315
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,046
Oh, my...

1316
01:06:30,121 --> 01:06:33,090
No, don't you turn away from me!
I asked you a question!

1317
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,681
You keep your hands off my mother!

1318
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:37,489
Hey, don't you touch him!

1319
01:06:39,664 --> 01:06:40,892
Get out of my house!

1320
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:51,373
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

1321
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:53,637
I'm okay. Look at me.
I'm okay.

1322
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:56,612
Why do you always got to defend him?

1323
01:06:59,617 --> 01:07:01,084
<i>Come here.</i>

1324
01:07:01,152 --> 01:07:03,746
<i>Come here, sweetheart.</i>

1325
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:14,420
You're always talking
about family.

1326
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:16,558
Family this, family that.

1327
01:07:16,634 --> 01:07:19,296
I told you they're not family.

1328
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,271
Ma, please don't start with me.

1329
01:07:53,204 --> 01:07:56,935
Hey, how come
you weren't inside?

1330
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:02,943
You having some problems
with Frank?

1331
01:08:08,052 --> 01:08:12,386
Mouse came to me for help,
and I sent him away.

1332
01:08:12,457 --> 01:08:14,891
Mouse is too far gone.

1333
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:17,689
Nobody could have helped him.

1334
01:08:17,762 --> 01:08:21,698
Maybe.

1335
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:24,633
I want you to wear a wire, Patty.

1336
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:26,670
Palmeri's cleaning house.

1337
01:08:26,738 --> 01:08:29,707
I'd like to stop him before he
gets rid of somebody else.

1338
01:08:29,774 --> 01:08:32,334
I just need to hear somebody say
that Palmeri ordered the hit.

1339
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:35,641
That's it.

1340
01:08:35,713 --> 01:08:39,308
And when it's over,
we'll take care of you.

1341
01:08:39,384 --> 01:08:43,514
We'll get you a nice house
someplace out of the city,

1342
01:08:43,588 --> 01:08:47,080
somewhere your kids
will be safe.

1343
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:50,059
Sounds so easy.

1344
01:08:50,128 --> 01:08:53,291
Good guys and bad guys...
pick a side.

1345
01:08:53,364 --> 01:08:54,331
They're criminals.

1346
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,696
So am I.
No, you're not.

1347
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:58,167
You made a mistake.

1348
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:01,171
Now you got a chance
to make it right.

1349
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:03,503
These people helped me.

1350
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:06,407
I made them my family.

1351
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:08,035
I knew what I was doing.

1352
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:09,306
You're not the same as they are.

1353
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,847
You don't know.

1354
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:12,280
I know what I see.

1355
01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:19,345
Hmm. Everybody says that.

1356
01:09:19,424 --> 01:09:22,757
And they all say something different.

1357
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,195
Thanks for the coffee.

1358
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:47,948
I, uh...

1359
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:51,819
I got these when he was born.

1360
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:54,084
500 bucks a box.

1361
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,524
I was passing them out like candy.

1362
01:10:00,598 --> 01:10:02,225
Frank, I'm sorry.

1363
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:04,598
I really am.

1364
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:09,936
I, uh, I can't go home.

1365
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:11,440
Mary's cleaning up the house.

1366
01:10:11,509 --> 01:10:14,740
The cupboards, the drawers,
the floors, everything.

1367
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:16,837
Smells like a morgue.

1368
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:22,676
Don't look at me like that.

1369
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:26,917
Like what?

1370
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:30,825
Like you hate me.

1371
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:32,624
I don't hate you, Frank.

1372
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:40,332
I could never hurt you.

1373
01:10:43,975 --> 01:10:46,500
You know that, right?

1374
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:50,877
You're inside me all the time.

1375
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,948
What's going on?
Why do you have a gun?

1376
01:12:00,017 --> 01:12:01,848
I'm next, Patty.
Palmeri blames me.

1377
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:03,318
Will you turn it off?

1378
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,514
What do you mean he blames you?
What do you...

1379
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,581
Because of Mouse. He's my kid!

1380
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:09,125
Just follow orders.

1381
01:12:09,193 --> 01:12:11,161
Honor, huh?

1382
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:13,162
Follow orders.

1383
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:14,993
Okay, Frank,
I don't know what's going on,

1384
01:12:15,066 --> 01:12:16,465
but you gotta get out of here.

1385
01:12:16,534 --> 01:12:18,764
No! No, what are you talking
about, "get out of here"?

1386
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:21,168
- I have two boys I have to protect.
- I understand that!

1387
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:22,603
You're walking around
with a shotgun!

1388
01:12:22,673 --> 01:12:24,436
Patty, I got it all worked out, okay?

1389
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:27,909
Got a friend owes me a favor.

1390
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:29,469
I want you to call him, okay?

1391
01:12:29,547 --> 01:12:31,447
Ask for plane tickets
someplace warm.

1392
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:32,482
I don't even care.

1393
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,482
It's over, Frank.

1394
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,280
No, it's for all of us.
It's over.

1395
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:37,685
I just need some time
to get back on my feet.

1396
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:39,655
We'll be like we were before,
only even better.

1397
01:12:39,724 --> 01:12:41,749
I promise, baby, okay?

1398
01:12:41,826 --> 01:12:43,316
I promise.

1399
01:12:53,404 --> 01:12:55,338
Hey.

1400
01:12:55,406 --> 01:12:59,103
Patty, holy crap,
you ever hear of a phone?

1401
01:12:59,176 --> 01:13:01,201
I tried calling. You don't answer.

1402
01:13:01,278 --> 01:13:02,973
Yeah, well, I been busy.

1403
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:04,639
Is Frank in trouble?

1404
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:06,649
Listen, I can't hang out.

1405
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:10,016
He thinks there's a hit out on him.
He wants to leave town.

1406
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:11,554
Yeah, well, maybe he should.

1407
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:13,055
What is that supposed to mean?

1408
01:13:13,124 --> 01:13:15,558
It means I don't know.

1409
01:13:19,196 --> 01:13:21,687
Oh, June.

1410
01:13:21,766 --> 01:13:24,360
Why would Sal go after Frank?

1411
01:13:24,435 --> 01:13:26,903
'Cause he's completely paranoid.

1412
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:29,531
Some FBI agent
gave him a nervous breakdown

1413
01:13:29,607 --> 01:13:31,768
saying somebody in the family
gave Mouse those drugs.

1414
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:32,809
Who would do that?

1415
01:13:32,877 --> 01:13:34,674
It doesn't matter, okay?
Sal is freaking out.

1416
01:13:34,745 --> 01:13:37,680
Last night, I thought
he was gonna kill me.

1417
01:13:37,748 --> 01:13:40,342
Listen, if I were you,
I would go to that club,

1418
01:13:40,418 --> 01:13:42,181
clean out the safe, and walk away.

1419
01:13:42,253 --> 01:13:44,414
That's easier said than done.

1420
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:45,648
Patty, listen to me.

1421
01:13:45,723 --> 01:13:48,419
It is not just Frank
who's been marked, okay?

1422
01:13:48,492 --> 01:13:49,516
It's you, too.

1423
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,229
I gotta go.

1424
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:56,789
I'm real sorry.

1425
01:14:38,776 --> 01:14:41,040
Now, if this were a movie...

1426
01:14:41,112 --> 01:14:43,444
and I was watching it,

1427
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:46,881
I'd say she planned on
taking the money and running.

1428
01:14:46,951 --> 01:14:49,476
Only, see, he got there first

1429
01:14:49,553 --> 01:14:51,885
because he knows
how very smart she is, and...

1430
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:55,483
well, he has to stay two steps
ahead of her at all times.

1431
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:57,754
Whatever you're thinking,
you don't have it right.

1432
01:14:57,828 --> 01:15:00,058
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

1433
01:15:01,732 --> 01:15:03,962
Sal, I've always been loyal to you.

1434
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:05,501
I might be thinking about, um,

1435
01:15:05,569 --> 01:15:08,504
what it feels like,
maybe, to look down a barrel

1436
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:10,631
at the end of your life...

1437
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:14,769
and all those things
that were important to you,

1438
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:17,040
just knowing you can open
a window, whenever you want,

1439
01:15:17,114 --> 01:15:21,483
and just get to feel
a little rain on your face.

1440
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:23,884
Frank wasn't helping Mouse.

1441
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:25,285
He knew what he was doing.

1442
01:15:25,356 --> 01:15:28,985
Okay, but killing him
is not gonna make things better.

1443
01:15:29,059 --> 01:15:32,256
Might send a message, don't you think?

1444
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:37,189
You told me...

1445
01:15:37,268 --> 01:15:39,668
that the most important thing
in life was family,

1446
01:15:39,737 --> 01:15:40,897
- you remember that?
- That's right.

1447
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:44,168
If there is no family
there's no trust, trust.

1448
01:15:44,241 --> 01:15:49,269
And on that subject,
I had a little thought:

1449
01:15:49,346 --> 01:15:52,577
Why don't you
take care of Frank,

1450
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,676
put an end to my troubles?

1451
01:15:58,556 --> 01:16:02,048
You... You want me to kill Frank.

1452
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:05,254
That does sound a little clumsy
when you put it like that.

1453
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:06,990
You're insane.

1454
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:11,626
You see, now, Frank,
he was a lot more polite

1455
01:16:11,702 --> 01:16:13,533
when I asked him to do Mouse.

1456
01:16:15,506 --> 01:16:18,566
He was a lot more polite.

1457
01:16:33,123 --> 01:16:34,147
Hey, what'd he say?

1458
01:16:34,225 --> 01:16:36,750
Did you get the tickets?

1459
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:40,957
What happened?

1460
01:16:41,031 --> 01:16:42,658
You tell me.

1461
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:47,766
I must have been crazy
to stand up for you.

1462
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:50,432
What are you talking about?

1463
01:16:52,977 --> 01:16:55,445
Did you kill your son?

1464
01:17:11,762 --> 01:17:15,095
Mouse crossed the line.

1465
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:18,794
I tried to warn him
a hundred times, Patty.

1466
01:17:22,273 --> 01:17:24,173
He was marked.

1467
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:27,404
I couldn't give it
to somebody else.

1468
01:17:27,478 --> 01:17:30,242
So he wouldn't suffer...

1469
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:34,618
so they wouldn't come after you.

1470
01:17:36,754 --> 01:17:39,222
You make me sick.

1471
01:17:40,858 --> 01:17:41,984
Patty.

1472
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:54,833
Patty, open the door!

1473
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:57,430
<i>Come on! Come on!
Let's talk about this!</i>

1474
01:17:57,508 --> 01:18:00,306
Open the door, or I'll break it down!

1475
01:18:00,377 --> 01:18:02,937
Patty, come on!

1476
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,947
You're not gonna leave me, Patty!

1477
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:07,040
You cannot leave me!

1478
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:09,244
I'll find you!
I'll find you wherever you go!

1479
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,754
You understand?

1480
01:18:11,822 --> 01:18:13,255
Open the door right now!

1481
01:18:13,324 --> 01:18:16,555
Patty, open up!

1482
01:18:16,627 --> 01:18:18,595
Open up right now!

1483
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:32,934
Mouse...

1484
01:18:57,701 --> 01:19:00,135
Time for school...
up, up, up, up.

1485
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:05,007
You heard her. Get up.

1486
01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:39,670
Hey, where you going?

1487
01:19:39,743 --> 01:19:41,506
I'm taking the boys to school.

1488
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:43,409
You're welcome to come.

1489
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,507
No, that's okay.

1490
01:19:47,584 --> 01:19:49,142
Have a good day.

1491
01:20:02,566 --> 01:20:04,693
I thought he wasn't
gonna stay with us anymore.

1492
01:20:04,768 --> 01:20:05,894
Shut up.

1493
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:07,994
Okay, I need you guys
to do something for me,

1494
01:20:08,072 --> 01:20:10,097
and it's very important.

1495
01:20:10,174 --> 01:20:11,664
Go to class like it's a normal day.

1496
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:14,905
At 11:30, ask to be excused.
Grandma will be waiting outside.

1497
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:16,240
If she's not here, do not wait

1498
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:18,281
even for five minutes,
do you understand?

1499
01:20:18,348 --> 01:20:20,077
This is where you're gonna go.

1500
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,777
Ask to speak to Robert Wilford.

1501
01:20:21,852 --> 01:20:23,342
He'll make sure you're all right.

1502
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,081
That says FBI.

1503
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:27,623
Yeah, we're not gonna stay
with Frank anymore, sweetie.

1504
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:28,817
I promise.

1505
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:32,350
I just need some time to get
some stuff together before we go.

1506
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:34,420
Yeah. Go where, Ma?

1507
01:20:34,498 --> 01:20:36,625
I don't know. Florida maybe.

1508
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,758
What's happening?

1509
01:20:37,835 --> 01:20:39,097
Okay, sweetie, it's okay.

1510
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:40,534
Are we gonna be all right?

1511
01:20:40,604 --> 01:20:42,572
Please, I need you to be brave.

1512
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:45,904
I made some mistakes,
but I'm gonna make it all better, all right?

1513
01:20:45,976 --> 01:20:47,568
Okay.
I love you.

1514
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:48,611
I love you, too.

1515
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:49,646
I love you.

1516
01:20:49,713 --> 01:20:51,442
I love you both.

1517
01:20:51,515 --> 01:20:54,348
Take care of your brother, okay?

1518
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:03,858
Joey, Joey.

1519
01:21:03,927 --> 01:21:05,861
What?

1520
01:21:07,965 --> 01:21:10,024
She has a gun.

1521
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:23,374
Do you think
she's gonna kill him?

1522
01:21:25,182 --> 01:21:26,774
Ma said we should wait.

1523
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:31,685
I need to talk to Sal.

1524
01:21:31,755 --> 01:21:35,316
Oh, all nice-nice now
you want to see Sal.

1525
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:37,792
What if Sal don't want
to see you?

1526
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:43,222
Oh, come on, you stupid bitch.

1527
01:21:44,535 --> 01:21:46,799
Ho.

1528
01:21:50,374 --> 01:21:52,103
Put down the gun.

1529
01:21:52,176 --> 01:21:56,237
If you want to talk to me,
put it down.

1530
01:22:00,284 --> 01:22:03,219
Where the hell is she?
It's only five minutes away.

1531
01:22:03,287 --> 01:22:04,811
I'd take my time, if I were her.

1532
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:30,604
Where is she?

1533
01:22:31,915 --> 01:22:33,382
You tell me, Joey.
Where is she?

1534
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,712
I'm calling the police.

1535
01:22:34,785 --> 01:22:36,252
No, you're not.
Give me the phone!

1536
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,584
Let go!
Hey, I asked you a question.

1537
01:22:38,655 --> 01:22:39,587
Where's your mother?

1538
01:22:39,656 --> 01:22:40,816
I don't know where she is!

1539
01:22:40,891 --> 01:22:42,153
Leave him alone!

1540
01:22:43,327 --> 01:22:44,851
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1541
01:22:44,928 --> 01:22:47,419
It's okay.
We're okay, right, Joey?

1542
01:22:47,497 --> 01:22:48,555
You're fine.

1543
01:22:51,435 --> 01:22:52,766
Your dime.

1544
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:59,134
I spent a lot of time asking myself

1545
01:22:59,209 --> 01:23:02,042
who would've been crazy enough
to work with Mouse,

1546
01:23:02,112 --> 01:23:06,776
risk their whole life
for a few dime bags.

1547
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:11,253
And then I realized...
it wasn't Frank.

1548
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:13,585
It wasn't even a guy.

1549
01:23:17,828 --> 01:23:20,763
It was right in front of me
the whole time.

1550
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:23,827
You gave her drugs
to keep her happy,

1551
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,233
and she found a way
to make a profit on the side.

1552
01:23:27,304 --> 01:23:29,602
And who could
blame her, really?

1553
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:32,608
Nothing to call your own,
just waiting for the day

1554
01:23:32,676 --> 01:23:34,610
someone turns you in
for a better model.

1555
01:23:36,947 --> 01:23:40,678
Yeah, that sounds very tragic.

1556
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:45,279
Why you telling me
all this crap, sad story, why?

1557
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:46,617
What do you want?

1558
01:23:48,992 --> 01:23:51,756
I want to get out.

1559
01:23:51,828 --> 01:23:55,958
I want to take my kids,
and I want to move away.

1560
01:23:56,033 --> 01:24:02,563
And I want you to let Frank live
as long as he leaves me alone.

1561
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,403
So you betray me, and then you
come here and ask for favors.

1562
01:24:05,475 --> 01:24:06,533
No one betrayed you.

1563
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:09,306
You got this guy living in your house
like a sniveling little child.

1564
01:24:09,379 --> 01:24:11,279
Frank did everything you asked.

1565
01:24:11,348 --> 01:24:13,908
He killed his own son
because you told him to.

1566
01:24:13,984 --> 01:24:14,916
His rules.

1567
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:19,319
Who broke those rules,
Frank... or you?

1568
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:26,223
I'm supposed to meet my kids.

1569
01:24:27,898 --> 01:24:30,059
Meeting's not over.

1570
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:32,158
My kids have a letter.

1571
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:33,566
If I don't show up,

1572
01:24:33,637 --> 01:24:37,767
all of this information
goes straight to the FBI.

1573
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:39,536
Of course they have a letter.

1574
01:24:39,609 --> 01:24:42,942
The FBI has tons of letters.

1575
01:24:43,013 --> 01:24:45,311
I'm still here.

1576
01:24:52,556 --> 01:24:56,083
Let's, uh, let's try
to understand one another.

1577
01:24:59,096 --> 01:25:01,894
This has nothing
to do with appearances

1578
01:25:01,965 --> 01:25:08,564
and nothing to do
with even a little bit to do with fear.

1579
01:25:08,638 --> 01:25:13,075
It has everything to do with...
weakness.

1580
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:18,408
My weakness.

1581
01:25:18,482 --> 01:25:19,813
Patty, um...

1582
01:25:22,753 --> 01:25:26,416
I know, um...

1583
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:28,822
um...

1584
01:25:32,963 --> 01:25:34,658
um...

1585
01:25:34,731 --> 01:25:37,723
Go on. You can go.

1586
01:25:37,801 --> 01:25:39,769
Thank you.

1587
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:42,295
Thank you.

1588
01:25:51,548 --> 01:25:52,845
Ma?

1589
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,679
Up here.

1590
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:03,985
Where's Nino and Joey?

1591
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,028
They're okay.
They're in their room.

1592
01:26:06,096 --> 01:26:07,188
Go get them ready.

1593
01:26:21,077 --> 01:26:22,101
Where you been?

1594
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:24,773
I went to see Sal.

1595
01:26:24,848 --> 01:26:26,577
And what happened?

1596
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:28,117
We made a deal.

1597
01:26:28,185 --> 01:26:31,245
He won't kill you if you stay
away from me and my family.

1598
01:26:35,425 --> 01:26:36,357
Um, I don't understand.

1599
01:26:36,426 --> 01:26:39,293
What does...
What does that mean?

1600
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:43,059
It means it's over. And I get out.

1601
01:26:48,872 --> 01:26:50,897
I won't be needing this anymore.

1602
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:53,239
Patty...

1603
01:26:58,782 --> 01:27:00,443
Good-bye, Frank.

1604
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:10,726
<i>True to his word,
Palmeri called off the hit.</i>

1605
01:27:10,794 --> 01:27:14,252
<i>Frank, who expected to go out
in a blaze of fire,</i>

1606
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:17,027
<i>died three years
later of colon cancer.</i>

1607
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,692
<i>In spite of the
shortage of witnesses,</i>

1608
01:27:18,768 --> 01:27:21,737
<i>Salvatore Palmeri
was sentenced to life in prison</i>

1609
01:27:21,805 --> 01:27:24,296
<i>for ordering the murder of Mouse.</i>

1610
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:28,174
<i>Pretty soon,
most of the guys we grew up with</i>

1611
01:27:28,245 --> 01:27:32,841
<i>were either locked up or dead.</i>

1612
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:37,580
<i>Agent Robert Wilford was promoted.
So was Bones...</i>

1613
01:27:37,654 --> 01:27:39,519
<i>an undercover agent the whole time.</i>

1614
01:27:42,759 --> 01:27:45,057
<i>June OD'd.</i>

1615
01:27:45,128 --> 01:27:48,393
<i>Accidental or not, nobody knows.</i>

1616
01:27:48,465 --> 01:27:51,923
<i>Ma did okay, considering.</i>

1617
01:27:52,002 --> 01:27:54,470
<i>Sunliner Express now
boarding on track 8</i>

1618
01:27:54,538 --> 01:27:56,165
<i>for Orlando and Miami.</i>

1619
01:27:58,375 --> 01:28:02,835
<i>My mother, she taught me
everything I know:</i>

1620
01:28:02,913 --> 01:28:06,405
<i>How to think for myself,
how to question authority</i>

1621
01:28:06,483 --> 01:28:08,678
<i>and most important,
how to say no...</i>

1622
01:28:08,752 --> 01:28:12,381
<i>because when the Devil shows up
with a truckload of promises,</i>

1623
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:16,084
<i>it's harder than you think
to walk away.</i>

1624
