1
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:52,630
The summer that
I was six years old,

2
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,767
my house burned
to the ground.

3
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,802
My mother died in that fire.

4
00:00:57,937 --> 00:01:00,216
I have no memory
of that night at all.

5
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,457
What I do have is the dream,

6
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:05,457
and in my dream,
my father set the fire.

7
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,388
Well, the way I see it--

8
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,940
Hold up. That's my son's car.
Is he all right?

9
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:41,285
He'll be okay.
They've taken him to memorial.

10
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,733
We don't need
that hose anymore.

11
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:06,078
All right, roll it up.

12
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,733
This one?
Yeah.

13
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:47,388
That's all I have so far.
That's cool.

14
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,940
Hey. Hey.

15
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,630
Hey, Mr. Reed.
Hi, Robin.

16
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,836
I just came by to bring
Seth his homework.

17
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,802
Don't let me interrupt.
I should be going.

18
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,181
I'll see ya later.
Thanks for the warning.

19
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,285
Bye.Bye.

20
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,733
Well, I'm waiting.
Let 'er rip.

21
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:10,974
I'm not mad at you.
I thrashed your car.

22
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,388
It's insured.

23
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:14,630
Matter of fact,

24
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,767
I got a call the first thing
this morning from the agent.

25
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:20,733
He said he wanted to talk
about the accident. I need some coffee

26
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:23,043
I know you're mad.
I'm not mad, Seth.

27
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,871
I'm gonna pay you back.
That's not the point.

28
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,423
Every last penny.
Could we just--

29
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:32,285
We need to talk
about what happened.

30
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,836
I was drinking.

31
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:40,630
I know.

32
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,078
I grabbed the bottle before
the police could find it.

33
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,319
Gee, thanks, Dad.

34
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,802
Was it because of the drinking,
or did you do it on purpose?

35
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,664
I skidded coming
around a corner.

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,112
What corner?
The road was straight.

37
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:55,630
It was dry.
It was a clear day.

38
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,250
It's all in
the accident report.

39
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:01,733
I just lost control.
There were no skid marks.

40
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,112
Even if you're drinking,
you see a tree, you hit the brakes.

41
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,526
You're not sending me to
another one of your shrinks...

42
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:11,112
'cause you think I tried
to off myself with a tree.

43
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:14,733
Come over here--
If you call now--

44
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:18,664
All right, folks, step in here.
I have an announcement.

45
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,664
Our prototype skid
has been selected...

46
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,526
to ship gas turbines
around the world.

47
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:34,595
Guys, you all know we have
a little tradition around here.

48
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:39,733
Whenever a salesman comes through,
his tie goes on the bulletin board...

49
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:42,699
for all to see and worship.

50
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:46,457
It was an ugly
tie anyway, Will.

51
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,940
How to prepare
for the boss's party.

52
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:57,043
Conjugate the word bored.

53
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,630
I am bored.
You are bored.

54
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:02,871
We are all bored.

55
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:05,905
Just keep pouring.

56
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,492
Oh, that's it.

57
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:13,733
You know that sale never would've
gone through without your design.

58
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:16,871
Welcome to the boys' club.

59
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:20,871
They only put ties
up on that bulletin board.

60
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,630
I should make 'em pin up
a pair of my panty hose.

61
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,492
Now, I'd worship that.

62
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:28,388
Yeah?Mm-hmm.

63
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,285
You know what I think?

64
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,699
No, what?

65
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,699
I think we make
a terrific team.

66
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,354
Give us a toast.

67
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,836
Here's to many more
successful joint ventures.

68
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:51,078
That's it?

69
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,354
We put together
a half-a-million-dollar deal,

70
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,905
and that's the best
you can come up with?

71
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,699
All right, you try one.

72
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:03,112
Okay, uh--

73
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:07,250
Here's to you.
Here's to me.

74
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:11,595
I hope we never disagree,
but if we do, fuck you.

75
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,595
Here's to me.

76
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,388
That's beautiful.
It's very touching.

77
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:21,492
I think I feel a tear.

78
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:31,699
you know what Dom Perignon
said when he created champagne?

79
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,147
Not a clue.

80
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:39,733
He said, "Come quick.
I'm tasting stars."

81
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,905
I'm tasting stars.

82
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,181
Oh, boy.

83
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:06,561
Uh-- I think I had
too much champagne.

84
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,767
No, no, no,
I was way out of line.

85
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:14,043
I should never have said
I'd worship your panty hose.

86
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:17,216
I should've said
that I'd respect them.

87
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:21,699
Just forget it.

88
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:27,147
I don't think
I wanna forget it.

89
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,595
There you two are.

90
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,733
Come on in.

91
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:33,940
Seth's gonna play
the piano for us.

92
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:47,595
Come on.
Don't be modest.

93
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:50,733
Play something beautiful.

94
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:33,354
Does he get
his talent from you?

95
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,871
I've got about as much
rhythm as a chainsaw.

96
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,871
His mother was the artist.

97
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:50,078
Hey. You know, I think
this valve is shot again.

98
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,905
Yeah. Can I talk
to you a minute?

99
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,699
What's up?

100
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,974
Is your boy still seeing
that psychologist?

101
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,871
Why?

102
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:04,319
Patricia found this in
Robin's chester drawers.

103
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,802
Robin said Seth
gave it to her.

104
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,905
He did?

105
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,905
What's this all about?

106
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,733
I don't know.

107
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:18,354
What is that, a squirrel?
I don't care what kind of animal it is.

108
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:23,181
That's not the point.
Patricia's upset about it.

109
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:26,181
To be honest,
I don't like it either.

110
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:30,836
What do you want me to do, Dan?
Talk to him. Find out what's going on.

111
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,561
All right.

112
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,836
Seth?

113
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,423
Seth, you home?

114
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:03,147
What are you doin'?
I was looking for you.

115
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:06,250
Looks like I'm found.

116
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,871
You want to talk about
the necklace, right? Yeah.

117
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:14,043
Robin told me her nosy mom found it going
through her stuff and had a meltdown.

118
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,354
They're not real bones,
you know?They're not?

119
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,905
No. Made out of
some type of cement.

120
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,216
I bought it at that
headbanger shop down the strip.

121
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:25,733
Robin thought it was ill.
What's the big deal?

122
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,733
Nothing. No big deal.

123
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,043
Can I get to
my room, please?

124
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,871
Sure.

125
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:55,905
Ta-da.

126
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,664
You guys look great.
Ready?

127
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,871
Here we go.

128
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:34,181
Where is he?

129
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,354
He's over there.

130
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,526
This whole thing is ridiculous,
you know? The music sucks.

131
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:46,561
Seth?
Hey.

132
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,733
You okay? Huh?Yeah.

133
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,871
Come on.
I didn't get to dance yet.

134
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:53,802
Come on. Let's go.
Give it up for Seth.

135
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:55,905
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

136
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,630
Thank you. Robin?
Come on. Here we go.

137
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:06,561
He just freaked out, and he started
yelling at me and calling me a bitch.

138
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,733
You're full of shit.
I didn't call you anything. You liar!

139
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:12,905
He threw me out of the car.
You fell, you skank.

140
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,147
Shut up! I don't want to hear
another word out of you!

141
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:18,181
Two sips from the bottle
and her paws were all over me.

142
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:22,526
I said shut up!
Go ahead. Tell me what happened.

143
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:27,595
Well, it was really
noisy inside.

144
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:31,526
So we went out to talk. Talk?

145
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:36,043
In the back seat?
You wanted to do it!

146
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:38,388
Hey! I'm warning you.
You asshole.

147
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:41,699
You creep. I hate you.

148
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:46,250
Robin?
Dad!

149
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:50,492
Honey. You all right?

150
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,733
You little shit.

151
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:55,181
You stay away from her!
You hear me! Goddammit! Dad!

152
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:59,043
You keep him away from her!
Dad, don't. Just take me home.

153
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,526
I just wanna go home.
Don't you evercome near her again.

154
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,526
Whoa.

155
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,423
What the hell's
wrong with you?

156
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:16,699
I need my medicine.

157
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:20,871
You want your medicine? I'll give
you your fuckin' medicine, huh!

158
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:24,181
Wanna be a tough guy?
All you can do is push women around.

159
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,905
Is that what you like? Make the girls cry?
I didn't do anything!

160
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,492
You pushed her!
I pushed her away!

161
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:34,009
She got too close.
I hate that smell.

162
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:37,767
It chokes me.

163
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:41,216
What smell?
What are you talkin' about?

164
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:44,733
Perfume.

165
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:49,733
Man, I hate it
when she gets too close.

166
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:55,871
I told her to get out of my room.
She shouldn't have touched me there.

167
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:59,664
Look at me.
What are you talking about?

168
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,216
What are you
talking about?What?

169
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,664
Who came in your room?

170
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,802
Seth, who touched--
Get the fuck away from me!

171
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,595
Seth Reed is in the house,
safe and sound.

172
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:57,871
Where have you been?
I drove to Portsmouth.

173
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:04,802
Why? Never mind.
It doesn't matter.

174
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:09,664
We have to talk about last night,
about your Mother.

175
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,767
My Mother?

176
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,181
You know, I was
thinkin' about my Mother.

177
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,871
I drove by where our old
house was in Portsmouth.

178
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:23,699
You know,
the one that burned down.

179
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,250
You know, I can't
remember her funeral.

180
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,009
I can't even remember
my Mother's funeral.

181
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:39,354
You were only six.
You could forget a lot.

182
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,733
Or make yoursel
if forget it.

183
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:42,905
That's what we need
to talk about.

184
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,216
About what you said
she did to you.

185
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,905
Did to me?

186
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:54,836
Yeah, you said that she--

187
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,319
You said that she touched you.

188
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,836
I didn't say that.

189
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:07,043
I didn't say that. No, but that's
what you were trying to tell me, wasn't it?

190
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,767
Man, you are screwed up.
You know that?

191
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:17,630
Let me tell you something.
She loved me.

192
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:20,733
She would never hurt me.

193
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:23,733
You just want to think bad things
about her because you hate her.

194
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:26,112
She was sick, Seth.

195
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:28,388
No, you're sick.

196
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:33,905
Know what I did in
Portsmouth this morning?

197
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,802
First smart thing
I ever did in my life.

198
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,733
Found a way to get
the hell away from you,

199
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,905
and Uncle Sam's
footing the bill.

200
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,492
I leave for boot camp
in two weeks,

201
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,699
right after graduation.

202
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,905
America can rest easy now.

203
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,733
The future of democracy
is in safe hands.

204
00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:52,078
Don't do it.
Just did.

205
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,733
Hi, Will. Seth.

206
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:03,871
We got a problem.
Do you know David Duncan?

207
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,147
Yeah, sure.
He's in my grade.

208
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,492
David didn't come
home last night.

209
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:10,802
They found his car
on the logging road.

210
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:13,078
His parents are starting
to put together a search party.

211
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,423
He's missing.

212
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:25,078
David!
David!

213
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:28,767
David!
David!

214
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:33,388
David!

215
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:35,388
David!

216
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:42,423
See anything?

217
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,388
David!

218
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,836
They're down by the river!

219
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,699
They found something!

220
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:05,423
Where is he?
Where is he?

221
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,181
Let go of me!

222
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,354
I want David!
I want my boy!

223
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,905
I want David! No!

224
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,595
Let go of me!
I want David! I want my boy!

225
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:37,871
Afternoon.
Afternoon.

226
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:41,767
I'm looking for Seth Reed.
Is he home?

227
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,974
No, but I'm his father.
What can I do for you?

228
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,181
So you're Will Reed.
That's right.

229
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,802
Detective Carlson. Do you know
when your son will be back?

230
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:53,250
Has he done something wrong?
I just want to talk to him.

231
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:57,319
What about?I'm investigating
the Duncan boy's murder.

232
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,836
Why would you want to
talk to Seth about that?

233
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,561
The last place the victim
was seen alive
was Shannon's Pizza.

234
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:06,699
Your son was also spotted
there about the same time.

235
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,250
Did you know your son
was there that night?

236
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:13,630
No.

237
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:17,216
Well, maybe your son saw somebody
suspicious hanging around there.

238
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:21,733
You know, J.D.L.R.S,
people who just don't look right.

239
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:26,905
Sometimes people remember
more than they think they do.

240
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,250
They just need a little prodding.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

241
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:33,733
If you can give him my card and have him
call me as soon as he gets in, I'd appreciate it.

242
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:36,871
All right.

243
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:39,078
I wasn't there.

244
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:41,905
They said you were. Well, I wasn't.
Why are you accusing me?

245
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,354
Nobody's accusing you of anything,
but you did drive there that night,

246
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:46,147
so stop denying it.

247
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:52,871
All right. Fine.
I was there.

248
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:55,147
You were?
That's what I said.

249
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:58,871
Then why'd you lie about it?
Did you see David?

250
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:02,009
Yeah, I saw him.
Why didn't you tell me?

251
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,733
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

252
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:07,112
You saw that kid three hours
before he was murdered.

253
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:10,595
I think that's
a pretty damn big deal.

254
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:13,112
Was he with anyone?
Do you mind?

255
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,078
He was just sitting there eating
pizza all alone on prom night,

256
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:22,802
feeling like shit.
You talked to him?

257
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:24,733
I asked him if he wanted to
drive out to the logging road

258
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,871
and finish off my bottle.

259
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:31,733
Wait a minute. You were out there with
him where we found him in the woods?

260
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:35,767
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you tell the police?

261
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,733
What do you think, Dad?
That I killed him?

262
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:41,216
Of course not.

263
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,733
Yeah, that's what you think.
No, I don't, Seth.

264
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:46,630
Yeah, it is.

265
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,250
Okay, I killed him.

266
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:53,733
Don't even joke about that.
I'm not joking.

267
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:55,699
I grabbed a rock
from the side of the river,

268
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:58,905
and I hit him
in the head with it.

269
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,905
That didn't work,

270
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,043
so I tried to strangle him
with my bare hands.

271
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,595
That didn't work either.

272
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:07,871
All right, that's enough.

273
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:10,181
So I stood on his neck,

274
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:12,250
and I pushed all
my weight against it.

275
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:14,388
That worked.

276
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:17,250
I said that's enough!

277
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:23,492
I got a lot of studying
to do for finals.

278
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,871
You'll want to hear this.

279
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:58,871
"Police have just charged
Brendan Garst with first-degree murder...

280
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:01,457
"in the strangulation death
of David Duncan,

281
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:04,319
"the Everett High School senior
whose body was found last week.

282
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:06,492
"Garst was arrested
yesterday at his home...

283
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:09,733
"for the brutal, bludgeoning
death of his ex-girlfriend,

284
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,285
"and last night, while under
interrogation for that murder,

285
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,974
he confessed
to slaying the teen."

286
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,733
You believed I did it.

287
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,699
You weren't
skeptical at all.

288
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,250
You said you did it.

289
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:27,595
I was at Shannon's Pizza,
but I didn't see David there.

290
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:30,871
Why did you say you did it?
Why did you say you killed him?

291
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:35,181
Wanted to see
how you'd react.

292
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:37,078
Now I know.

293
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:01,595
You sure about this?

294
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,733
Yeah, I'm sure.

295
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,423
Who knows? Maybe the
army will be good for me.

296
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,457
Put some hair on my chest.
Put some on your face, too.

297
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:15,767
Thanks for the van.

298
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:17,423
It's nothing.

299
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,250
Listen, Seth--Oh, I forgot.

300
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,147
I got you a present, too.

301
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,630
It's not much, but--

302
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:43,250
Thank you.

303
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,043
Well, I gotta get goin'.

304
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:25,940
Hi.Hi.

305
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,250
Brought the sketch.

306
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:37,595
I made these adjustments
for the new design criteria.

307
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,285
That should bring us
in line with the specs.

308
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,802
Let me take a look at it
and get back to you.

309
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:48,388
Maybe we should
talk about this.

310
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,181
Well, let me run
the numbers first, okay?

311
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,836
I don't mean this this.

312
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:55,147
Oh. That.

313
00:26:55,282 --> 00:27:00,457
This. That.

314
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:03,457
Why are you making this
so complicated, Will?

315
00:27:03,593 --> 00:27:05,836
We've been friends
for four years.

316
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,388
That's longer than
my marriage lasted.

317
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:11,630
That doesn't mean we know each other.
Think I'm hiding something?

318
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:17,043
Well, to be continued.

319
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,250
We're on company time.

320
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,147
You're not gonna take no
for an answer, are you?

321
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,802
No.

322
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:34,836
Saturday I'm going
to set the table for two.

323
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:37,043
Say 6:00.

324
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:40,250
The rest is up to you.

325
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:51,905
You miss him?

326
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,078
Not yet.

327
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:57,595
Things were getting
a little stressful.

328
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:01,767
I think my parents threw
a ticker-tape parade when I moved out.

329
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:08,423
I could not wait
to get away from home.

330
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,905
And here I am, living in the
same house I grew up in.

331
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,078
It's strange.

332
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:14,940
How'd that happen?

333
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:21,871
Well, about the time my parents
decided to retire to Florida,

334
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:24,526
my marriage fell apart.

335
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,905
I was devastated,
just couldn't even function.

336
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:32,492
Bought this place from them
because it was so isolated.

337
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,974
I wanted to be alone...
and suffer.

338
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:43,250
I took long walks in the woods,
planted a garden, went fishing.

339
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:46,181
And then a miracle happened.

340
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:49,078
I started to notice things.

341
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:53,767
How a plant I put in had
a perfect little blossom.

342
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:58,595
Or how the berries from my own
garden tasted so much sweeter.

343
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,561
It was like the past
was too painful to remember,

344
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:06,767
and the future
was overwhelming.

345
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:09,423
But when I concentrated
on the here and now,

346
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:11,940
the moment that I was living,

347
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:15,905
there was always
something beautiful in it.

348
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:19,767
So that's what I started to do.
Live in the moment.

349
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:23,664
And I stopped suffering.

350
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,733
I'm, uh--

351
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:09,664
I'm kind of scarred up
back there.

352
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:14,802
We all have scars.

353
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:18,250
Morning, Heidi.

354
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:19,354
Morning, Will.

355
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:06,802
That's what happens.

356
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:13,009
Happy Father's Day.
Thanks, Seth.

357
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:15,457
Come on. Come on.
Open it.

358
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:26,561
It's a ski jacket.
Snazzy.

359
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:30,733
Yeah, that's what it is.
Nice.

360
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:39,043
Oh! What?
That figures.

361
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,043
I told them a large.
They give ya a small.

362
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:44,112
- That's okay. I can exchange it tomorrow after work.
- Sorry about that.

363
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:47,216
Well, I am gonna do
the girl thing

364
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:49,250
and cut the cake.

365
00:32:56,765 --> 00:33:00,595
Well, the Army
sure has changed.

366
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:03,595
I don't remember enlisted men
being able to wear ponytails.

367
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,733
- You noticed, huh?
- What happened?

368
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:10,043
Well, it's just that
the army and I

369
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:12,595
had a little
misunderstanding
the very first day.

370
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:14,078
It was decided
It'd be best

371
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:18,836
if we just went
our separate ways.

372
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:21,009
What can I say?
You were right.

373
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:22,250
It was a stupid move.

374
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:28,561
Where have you been
all this time?

375
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:31,871
North Carolina.
Just hangin' around.

376
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:35,423
It was gettin' hot as hell
down there, and it's not home,

377
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:37,699
So I'm back.

378
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:03,285
Hi. Can I help you?
What's with the TV cameras?

379
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,561
You wouldn't believe it. Some guy
came shopping here yesterday morning.

380
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:09,905
Then he disappeared. This is the
last place anybody saw him.

381
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,112
Was he from around here?
Uh-uh. Tourist.

382
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:15,043
It's so creepy. I had to be
interviewed by the police,

383
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,043
'cause I was the one who helped
him pick out a present for his dad.

384
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,595
They wanted
to know everything,

385
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:23,078
but how much can you say about
a small, red ski jacket?

386
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:25,871
He seemed really nice.
I hope he's all right.

387
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:29,319
I'm sorry.
Did you need some help?

388
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:32,250
No, thanks.

389
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,423
Shit. Shit.That's all right.
Keep going.

390
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:56,009
I am no good at this!

391
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,940
It's all right.
It's all right. Here.

392
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,974
You have beautiful hands.

393
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,630
Will says...

394
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:21,974
your Mother taught you.

395
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,043
Yeah, she wanted me
to be a concert pianist.

396
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:30,767
She started giving me
lessons when I was three.

397
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:33,905
Every day for
two or three hours.

398
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,733
I could read music
when I was four.

399
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,767
So you were a prodigy?

400
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:48,733
You coming over
to the house tonight?

401
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,733
Yes.

402
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:55,526
Does it bother you?

403
00:35:55,662 --> 00:36:00,940
I mean, I would never, ever...

404
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,423
try to replace your mother.

405
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,561
Do you know how she died?

406
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:13,905
No.

407
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,940
The summer that
I was six years old...

408
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:23,905
our house burned
to the ground.

409
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,871
She died in that fire.

410
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:33,457
I have no memory
of that night,

411
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:36,767
but I do have this dream,

412
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,940
and in my dream,
my Father set the fire.

413
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,112
Well, it's just a dream.

414
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,492
What was your father like
growing up?

415
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:02,250
He was... fine.

416
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,940
He was a good father.

417
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:07,974
And your mother was fine,

418
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,630
and your brothers
and sisters were fine,

419
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:12,940
and the whole family
was fine, fine, fine.

420
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:17,285
What?
You don't believe me?

421
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,905
They say every family is a dictatorship
ruled by its sickest member.

422
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,940
The trick is figuring
out who that is.

423
00:37:29,317 --> 00:37:33,423
You hear about the
David Alan Duncan case?

424
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,595
Turns out the guy they arrested
couldn't have done it.

425
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:40,147
I thought he confessed.
He confessed to a lot of crimes.

426
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:42,388
He was a chronic confessor.
But they figured out

427
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:44,595
that he was in
a mental institution
under another name

428
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,802
the night that David
was murdered.

429
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:49,112
Hmph. I'll be damned.

430
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:52,974
Oh, by the way,
I went to exchange
that jacket today.

431
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,147
They have the right size?

432
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:57,319
Yeah, they did,

433
00:37:57,455 --> 00:37:59,871
but they said I needed
the receipt to exchange it.

434
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:01,250
Still have it, don't you?

435
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:03,630
Since when do you need
a receipt for an exchange?

436
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:05,216
They said it was a sale item.

437
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,733
You bought it at
the Father's Day sale, right?

438
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,561
That's right.

439
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:11,974
Well, you can
just get a check stub
or credit card slip.

440
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,664
Paid cash.

441
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,802
Well, if you could
just find the receipt then.

442
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:17,974
You know,
I think I threw it away.

443
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,250
Trash pickup
isn't until Thursday.

444
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:26,974
All right. You need the receipt,
I'll find the receipt.

445
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:53,492
David Alan... Duncan.

446
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,630
Mama loves her baby.

447
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:47,630
Mama loves her baby.

448
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:51,836
Mama loves her baby.

449
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,802
Mr. Reed? Yes.

450
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:32,767
Hi. I'm Amanda Hall.
Hi. How do you do?

451
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:34,147
Fine. Thank you.

452
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,733
Two officers spotted the van
parked behind the pharmacy.

453
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:43,216
The license number matched the
one you had reported to the police.

454
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:46,112
Upon entering the building,
they apprehended your son.

455
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:49,319
A body search produced
50 capsules of Percodan
in his possession.

456
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:50,354
Thanks.

457
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:55,940
I had trouble sleeping.

458
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,492
Migraines.

459
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:00,974
Doctor prescribed Percodan.

460
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,250
I got hooked.

461
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,871
The prosecutor is gonna
push for intent to sell.

462
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:09,492
What I'll argue
is that you're an addict,
not a dealer,

463
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,802
and I'll try to plead down
to breaking and entering.

464
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:13,733
Well, I'm not a dealer.

465
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,078
I mean,
I don't have a record
or anything like that.

466
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:18,285
A rehab program will have
to be part of the plea.

467
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,388
But with any luck,
it can be outpatient.

468
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:24,802
Can I speak to my son
alone for a moment?

469
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,836
Of course.
I'll be outside.Okay.

470
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,940
You know they have
the death penalty here?

471
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:46,492
For robbery?

472
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:50,561
I thought they just
cut off your hands.

473
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,974
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

474
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,905
'Cause I got a hot date with
little Miss Briefcase out there

475
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,871
to go over my plea bargain.

476
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:00,871
I don't want to be late.

477
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:02,905
You know, I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately...

478
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,561
about a lot of things
that go way back.

479
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:08,802
I've even started
thinking about that dog.

480
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:12,767
We never had a dog, Dad.

481
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,767
The one we found,
remember?

482
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:18,112
You were about seven.

483
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:22,147
Yeah, It'd been hit by a car or
something, right?  That's right.

484
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:25,423
And I went to get help.

485
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:29,871
So, Will,

486
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:33,871
what is it about that dog
that's got you so upset?

487
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:37,147
Tell me. That was just
the beginning, wasn't it?

488
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,285
Yes, yes.
The beginning of what?

489
00:43:42,213 --> 00:43:45,319
I want you to tell me what
happened while I was gone.

490
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:50,664
'Cause that dog
should've made it.

491
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:57,043
What are you saying?

492
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,836
That I killed it?

493
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:06,009
You think I killed the dog?

494
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,492
Plead guilty.
Don't get probation.

495
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:12,423
What?Let them put you in
a hospital where they can help you.

496
00:44:12,558 --> 00:44:16,733
You want me committed?
What are you trying to do to me?

497
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:19,733
I'm trying to save you, Seth.
Don't you understand?

498
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:22,112
You need help.

499
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:24,595
You're the one who needs help.
You're out of your fuckin' mind.

500
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:31,733
Aah!

501
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:36,802
I can't stress enough that I desperately
want to change my conduct for the rest of my life.

502
00:44:36,937 --> 00:44:39,767
I've been a heavy drinker
since the seventh grade.

503
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:42,147
Then I got addicted
to Percodan.

504
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:44,940
If it were not
for that addiction,

505
00:44:45,075 --> 00:44:49,112
I never would've broken
into that pharmacy.

506
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:52,767
It was the climax of my idiocy,

507
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:55,767
of the addiction
controlling my life.

508
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:58,561
I will enter a rehab program.

509
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:03,423
I want to be sober
and drug free.

510
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:06,561
And, Your Honor, if you
will grant me probation...

511
00:45:06,696 --> 00:45:08,905
and give me the opportunity
to put this incident behind me,

512
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:12,802
I promise you...
you won't regret it.

513
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:18,388
Please, don't let
this one mistake ruin my life.

514
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,319
Do we have an evaluation?

515
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:25,630
It's on your desk, Your Honor.

516
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,112
The presentence psychiatric evaluation
showed the highest probability...

517
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:31,285
that Mr. Reed will
live a productive life
if granted probation.

518
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,940
Does the prosecution have
any objections to probation?

519
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:39,388
The state feels that's an appropriate
disposition in this case, Your Honor.

520
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:42,595
Very well.
I'm prepared to rule.

521
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:45,595
Your Honor, I'd like to
have the chance to speak.

522
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:48,112
- And you are? - I don't want him to talk.
- I'm his father.

523
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:51,423
Your Honor, my client requests that
Mr. Reed not speak for the defense.

524
00:45:51,558 --> 00:45:53,630
Very well.
Please be seated, Mr. Reed.

525
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:56,319
Your Honor, please!
Please, let me speak.

526
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:58,733
Mr. Reed, approach the bench.

527
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:10,733
What's this about, Mr. Reed?

528
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,423
Your Honor, my son may
have committed other crimes.

529
00:46:14,558 --> 00:46:18,836
What other crimes?Murder.

530
00:46:18,972 --> 00:46:22,492
It stands for
David Alan Duncan.

531
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:26,871
My son must've gotten it
off of him that night.

532
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:30,836
I've been wearing it around
my neck for a couple of months.

533
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,974
And he's been sending me other things.
I don't know what to call them.

534
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,285
Mementos.

535
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,630
He sent me this watch...

536
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,181
when he was living near
an army base in North Carolina.

537
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:50,767
While he was there,
a Private was reported missing.

538
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:57,699
And-- this ski jacket.

539
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:04,733
Todd Milliken bought a red jacket
at the Jack Frost Ski Shop.

540
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:07,871
That was the last
anybody ever saw of him.

541
00:47:08,006 --> 00:47:13,216
Then Seth shows up
that same day with this jacket.

542
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:16,733
Same brand, same size.

543
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:19,492
I think this is
Todd Milliken's jacket.

544
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:21,836
He bought this
for his father.

545
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,871
That's why
it doesn't fit me.

546
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:34,112
It's like he's trying to suck me into
this and make me a part of what he's doing.

547
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:38,147
I think there's a part of him
that really wants me to know,

548
00:47:38,282 --> 00:47:41,905
that wants me
to help him end it.

549
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,595
The first thing I'm gonna do
is pay a visit to the Duncan's,

550
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,802
get them to identify
this necklace.

551
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,595
They said
it's not their son's.

552
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,561
They're positive
they've never seen it before.

553
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:26,940
Call it a radical thought,
but I think d-a-d stands for dad.

554
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:29,319
As for the watch
Seth mailed you,

555
00:48:29,455 --> 00:48:30,940
it's a completely
common type.

556
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,009
You can get it anywhere.

557
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:35,733
We also checked out
the Jack Frost Ski Shop.

558
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:37,319
They sold 18 of
those jackets that day.

559
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:39,802
They figured
at least six of them
would have been red.

560
00:48:39,937 --> 00:48:43,595
Are you telling me
that it's just a coincidence...

561
00:48:43,731 --> 00:48:46,767
that my son was in the same place at the
same time that three murders were committed?

562
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:49,319
One murder.
There's only one body.

563
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:51,112
The rest are missing persons.

564
00:48:51,248 --> 00:48:54,836
I spoke to a major about the missing
Private in North Carolina.

565
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:57,595
Army figures
he just went AWOL.

566
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:01,078
His bunk mate said he hated the army.
He was always talking about skipping out.

567
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:04,009
The kid from the Jack Frost Ski Shop
has a history of drug abuse.

568
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:07,388
Even his family admits that
he has a habit of taking off

569
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,767
for long periods
of time,

570
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:12,699
going on underground binges
from Boston to Chicago.

571
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,871
Look, this is
good news, Mr. Reed.

572
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:21,457
Your son didn't do it.

573
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:24,802
You should be happy.
Why aren't you happy?

574
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:30,250
The prosecutor
has informed me

575
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:33,526
that there are no grounds
for any additional indictments.

576
00:49:33,662 --> 00:49:35,664
Therefore, Seth Reed,

577
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,009
under the first offender program
for nonviolent criminals,

578
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:42,871
I sentence you to five years
probation under the following conditions:

579
00:49:43,006 --> 00:49:48,043
that you seek psychological counseling
for a minimum of one hour per week for 10 weeks,

580
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:49,905
that you enter an outpatient--

581
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:35,767
Yeah?

582
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:38,974
Will?
I can't believe I got you.

583
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,974
I've been leaving
messages for you everywhere.

584
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,250
Listen, I can't talk now.

585
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:45,974
- Will, I know what's going on.
- What do you know?

586
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,905
Everything. Seth called me.

587
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:53,974
What's happening to you, Will?

588
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,871
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

589
00:51:56,006 --> 00:51:59,078
Just... tell me
what Seth told you.

590
00:51:59,213 --> 00:52:01,733
He said...

591
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:07,250
that you had accused him
of killing somebody.

592
00:52:07,386 --> 00:52:10,940
The police proved
he didn't do it,

593
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:13,043
but you still
think he did.

594
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:16,699
What else?

595
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,561
What else?

596
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,802
He's worried about you.

597
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:28,112
He thinks that
you're unstable.

598
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:30,561
Paranoid.

599
00:52:30,696 --> 00:52:32,733
He said that you...

600
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:34,836
made up things
about him being crazy.

601
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:40,905
Do you think
I want to believe this?

602
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:42,940
He's my son, Tina.

603
00:52:43,075 --> 00:52:45,767
He's my son.Okay.

604
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,905
Okay.

605
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,595
Help me to understand.

606
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:54,561
Tell me everything.

607
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,871
Tell me.

608
00:53:04,455 --> 00:53:07,595
Is that why we're here?
You're watching him?

609
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,905
I have to go.You've been
following him, Will?

610
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:18,802
Go home, Tina.

611
00:53:18,937 --> 00:53:21,009
No.
I'm coming with you.

612
00:53:31,903 --> 00:53:35,974
God, Will, slow down.

613
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,767
He's gonna kill somebody else.

614
00:53:40,213 --> 00:53:43,974
- Will, stop. Stop it!
- Go! Go! Come on!

615
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:47,009
- Will!
- Come on! Come on!

616
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:49,733
- Damn!
- What the hell is the matter with you?

617
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:51,974
I have to stop him.

618
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:16,457
Stay in the car.

619
00:54:29,386 --> 00:54:32,043
Don't get in
that van with him!Hey!

620
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:36,836
Oh, don't shoot. Please.
I'm trying to save your life.

621
00:54:36,972 --> 00:54:39,492
Save my life?
He was gonna kill you.

622
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:43,871
You're Will Reed,
aren't you?

623
00:54:44,006 --> 00:54:46,733
Yeah, I thought so.

624
00:54:46,868 --> 00:54:50,905
I'm the probation officer
in charge of your son's case.

625
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,078
I've been gettin'
an earful about you.

626
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:55,940
You wanna explain what the
hell's goin' on here?

627
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:57,802
I was just trying to...

628
00:54:57,937 --> 00:54:59,250
make sure he doesn't...

629
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:01,147
do anything wrong.

630
00:55:01,282 --> 00:55:04,112
That's not your job.
That's my job.
You've already done enough.

631
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:06,940
- You set me up.
- He set you up?

632
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:10,009
You're the one coming
down here like a maniac.

633
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:11,078
You listen to me, Mr. Reed.

634
00:55:11,213 --> 00:55:13,250
You're gonna stay away
from your son.

635
00:55:13,386 --> 00:55:15,733
You're gonna stop interfering
with his probation program.

636
00:55:15,868 --> 00:55:17,905
If you don't,
I'll get a restraining order.

637
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,078
Violate that, your ass is going
straight to jail for contempt of court.

638
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:21,354
Is that clear?

639
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:24,802
Don't piss me off.

640
00:55:27,868 --> 00:55:29,871
All right.
Good.

641
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:34,905
Your son's got a job.
He's clean and sober.

642
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,767
He's tryin' to get
his shit together.

643
00:55:36,903 --> 00:55:39,147
So just stay the
hell away from him.

644
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:57,181
Did you get my present?

645
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,319
You know where those
sunglasses came from?

646
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,974
K-mart.

647
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,112
I bought 'em.
They're my sunglasses.

648
00:56:13,558 --> 00:56:15,767
I love fuckin' with you.

649
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:28,285
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

650
00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:37,043
Do you believe me?

651
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:44,733
I believe that...

652
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,767
you believe it.

653
00:57:21,765 --> 00:57:23,802
Sorry.

654
00:57:23,937 --> 00:57:25,802
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

655
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:31,802
I know I had problems.

656
00:57:31,937 --> 00:57:34,423
I drank too much.

657
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:37,112
Did drugs.
Screwed up at school.

658
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:39,457
Ditched out of the Army.

659
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:42,319
I even tried
to kill myself once.

660
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,699
But I've started
seeing someone.
A psychologist.

661
00:57:51,455 --> 00:57:55,078
She's helping me start to see
how my problems started, which--

662
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:56,871
well, that's the first step.

663
00:57:58,593 --> 00:58:02,250
The psychologist,
she told me that,

664
00:58:02,386 --> 00:58:05,492
inside my head, it's like,
there are these screens...

665
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:10,630
blocking me from seeing
the truth about the past.

666
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,767
And the more screens
I pull away...

667
00:58:17,282 --> 00:58:19,181
the clearer
the truth will be.

668
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,802
Can you face the truth, Tina?

669
00:58:38,317 --> 00:58:42,285
Do you feel that?
Yes.

670
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,423
Twenty stitches.

671
00:58:44,558 --> 00:58:46,388
My Father did that to me.

672
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:54,009
I don't believe you.

673
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:59,078
You don't think that people like my
Father do things like that to their kids?

674
00:58:59,213 --> 00:59:00,767
I don't believe
that Will would.

675
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:05,354
I was six years old.

676
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,940
I was taking a bath.

677
00:59:08,075 --> 00:59:09,699
He'd been drinking.

678
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:14,974
I was playing with my toys.

679
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,940
I guess I was splashing
a lot 'cause he got mad.

680
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:20,457
So, he just
hauled off and hit me.

681
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:25,974
My head flew back
and hit the back of the tub.

682
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:29,181
No. Why are you
telling me this?

683
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:31,388
It's the truth.

684
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:35,940
I think I know him
better than that.

685
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:39,181
You never know what people
are capable of, Tina.

686
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:41,802
You think you know someone.

687
00:59:41,937 --> 00:59:44,492
People never really
know each other.

688
00:59:46,972 --> 00:59:50,492
I still do not
believe you.

689
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:54,181
He did worse.

690
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,492
He'd come into
my room at night--

691
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:05,940
I don't wanna hear any more.
I don't wanna hear any more.

692
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:08,595
I wanted him
out of my room,

693
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:11,216
but he said
I was the bad one.

694
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:13,147
I was the filthy one.

695
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,009
And that
my Mom was bad, too.

696
01:00:18,144 --> 01:00:20,664
He'd say that to me
about her all the time.

697
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,802
She was dangerous.

698
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:25,664
That he needed
to protect me from her.

699
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:29,940
I think he believed it.

700
01:00:33,317 --> 01:00:35,836
And that's why he killed her.

701
01:00:39,075 --> 01:00:40,561
He set that fire.

702
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:46,319
No. No.
It is not possible.

703
01:00:46,455 --> 01:00:48,836
It's not possible.

704
01:00:48,972 --> 01:00:50,147
I'm telling you the truth,

705
01:00:50,282 --> 01:00:51,940
because I don't want anything
to happen to you, Tina.

706
01:00:52,075 --> 01:00:53,802
That's the only reason
I'm telling you.

707
01:00:53,937 --> 01:00:57,664
Before this thing goes
too far with you and my dad.

708
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,940
No.

709
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:12,905
Tina?
Honey, are you okay?

710
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,940
No, I'm not okay.

711
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:18,354
What happened?

712
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:20,733
It's time to get everything
out in the open, Will.

713
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:23,630
I don't believe
you've told me the truth.

714
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:27,319
I want to know everything.

715
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:29,767
I want to know
about your wife...

716
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:31,802
and what happened to her.

717
01:01:31,937 --> 01:01:34,802
What did Seth tell you?

718
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:37,733
This isn't about what Seth told me.
He said terrible things.

719
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:40,802
I wanna hear it from you!

720
01:01:40,937 --> 01:01:42,836
Okay. Okay.

721
01:01:58,075 --> 01:02:01,457
You're right. I didn't tell
you the truth about my wife.

722
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,181
But I want you
to understand something.

723
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:06,733
I did what I had to do.

724
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:08,802
She was dangerous to Seth.

725
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,561
I had no choice.

726
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,181
What did you do?

727
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:19,630
You think knowing the truth
will solve everything.

728
01:02:19,765 --> 01:02:23,974
That you can fix
anything with the truth.

729
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,285
But you're wrong.

730
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,974
The truth will not
set you free.

731
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,526
I don't care.

732
01:02:36,903 --> 01:02:39,664
Hold on.

733
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:58,043
Will?

734
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:09,009
Will--

735
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:16,112
Can somebody help me please?

736
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:35,112
Hi.Hi.

737
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:37,181
You're going
to be just fine.

738
01:03:39,868 --> 01:03:42,492
Tina, listen to me.

739
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:44,905
Everything
makes sense now.

740
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:48,250
What?

741
01:03:48,386 --> 01:03:50,250
At Shannon's,

742
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:54,147
there's a machine that turns
copper pennies into medallions.

743
01:03:54,282 --> 01:03:56,285
David Duncan
made the medallion,

744
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,630
with his initials on it,

745
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:00,940
the night that
he was murdered.

746
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:03,147
That's why his parents
didn't recognize it.

747
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:06,285
They never got
a chance to see it.

748
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,112
I don't know what
you're talking about.

749
01:04:09,248 --> 01:04:12,733
Seth did this.

750
01:04:12,868 --> 01:04:14,699
He poisoned your drink.

751
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:17,767
Poison?

752
01:04:23,248 --> 01:04:26,009
Did he do it, Will?

753
01:04:26,144 --> 01:04:27,974
Or did you?

754
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:42,526
What the hell
are you doing?

755
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:45,940
What are you
doing here?

756
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:48,836
Christ, you almost killed me with that thing!
What's the matter with you?

757
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,974
I thought you were Seth.

758
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,664
I thought you were Seth.

759
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:57,492
What's goin' on here, Will?

760
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:59,285
You haven't been to work
in two weeks.

761
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,664
Listen. Listen to me.

762
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,457
You were right all along.

763
01:07:03,593 --> 01:07:05,940
Right about what?

764
01:07:06,075 --> 01:07:09,630
You know that necklace
that Seth gave to Robin?

765
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:13,147
The one made of bones?
Well, they were-- they were real.

766
01:07:13,282 --> 01:07:15,767
He kept the bodies
up in the eaves.

767
01:07:15,903 --> 01:07:17,871
He takes them with him
wherever he goes.

768
01:07:18,006 --> 01:07:21,216
See, that's why there's no bodies.
No bodies, no murder.

769
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:24,802
It's just a bunch of missing
kids that nobody cares about.

770
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:26,664
And you see
this powder?

771
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,112
This is lime.

772
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:32,181
That's what he uses
to get rid of the smell.

773
01:07:32,317 --> 01:07:34,974
He's hidden them somewhere.
I gotta find them.

774
01:07:37,144 --> 01:07:39,836
Will, you need help.

775
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:44,009
Serious psychological help.

776
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,664
Dad!

777
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,078
I came as soon as I heard.
Is she gonna be all right?

778
01:08:13,248 --> 01:08:16,630
Seth!
Help me up.

779
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:19,112
Seth, please!
Help me.

780
01:08:22,179 --> 01:08:24,836
- Why? You killed her.
- Seth--

781
01:08:28,144 --> 01:08:30,319
I didn't kill your Mother.

782
01:08:30,455 --> 01:08:33,250
I didn't kill her.

783
01:08:33,386 --> 01:08:35,733
She's alive.

784
01:08:35,868 --> 01:08:37,871
Your Mother's alive.

785
01:08:41,627 --> 01:08:43,836
Please. Please.

786
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:46,767
Where is she?

787
01:09:16,455 --> 01:09:17,974
Mom?

788
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,354
Oh, my God.

789
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:38,147
It's been so long.

790
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,354
I knew, one day, that you'd
walk through that door.

791
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,181
Oh, don't do that.

792
01:09:53,317 --> 01:09:56,630
No, don't be sad.

793
01:09:56,765 --> 01:10:00,354
Everything's
gonna be all right.

794
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:03,561
I hate it
when you're sad.

795
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:08,492
You remember how
Mama loves her baby.

796
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:12,595
Mama loves her baby.
Mama loves her baby.

797
01:10:12,731 --> 01:10:14,940
Mama loves her baby.
Loves her baby

798
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:01,871
Is it soup yet?

799
01:13:14,317 --> 01:13:15,630
Relax.

800
01:13:15,765 --> 01:13:18,319
The Percodan has kicked
in by now, hasn't it?

801
01:13:23,144 --> 01:13:24,871
Should make you
nice and drowsy.

802
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:49,043
Before you drift off, can--

803
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:50,802
can we play a game?

804
01:13:53,006 --> 01:13:55,802
'Cause...

805
01:13:55,937 --> 01:13:58,492
I think I had things
a little backwards, didn't I?

806
01:14:02,455 --> 01:14:05,078
But see, my Mother
removed another screen.

807
01:14:05,213 --> 01:14:09,147
Now, everything's clear.

808
01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:12,526
I never hurt you.
You know that now.

809
01:14:12,662 --> 01:14:14,561
It was her.

810
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:17,112
You were worse than her.

811
01:14:17,248 --> 01:14:20,147
You let it happen.

812
01:14:20,282 --> 01:14:22,250
You left me alone with her.

813
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:26,492
Come on. Let's play.

814
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:30,009
Seth is five years old,

815
01:14:30,144 --> 01:14:33,836
you come home
and find his--

816
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:36,940
his little head
in a bandage.

817
01:14:37,075 --> 01:14:39,319
What do you do?

818
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:42,112
If you're gonna
kill me, do it now.

819
01:14:49,937 --> 01:14:52,043
Wrong answer.

820
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:54,354
Sorry.

821
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,354
I'll give you
a little hint.

822
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,423
You don't do Jack shit.

823
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,802
Why didn't you do something?

824
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:13,974
She said it was an accident.
That you slipped in the tub.

825
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,733
I was out of the country.

826
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:18,871
You were always out of
the country back then.

827
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:21,871
It was my job.

828
01:15:22,006 --> 01:15:24,147
How about the time...

829
01:15:24,282 --> 01:15:28,009
you came home´and little
Seth's arm was in a cast?

830
01:15:28,144 --> 01:15:30,181
What about that, huh?

831
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:33,388
She said you
fell off a jungle gym...

832
01:15:33,524 --> 01:15:35,216
and I believed her.

833
01:15:36,696 --> 01:15:38,871
You knew.
No.

834
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:42,112
You knew!
No.

835
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:44,285
Don't fuckin' lie to me.

836
01:15:47,006 --> 01:15:48,940
You could've saved me.

837
01:15:49,075 --> 01:15:50,699
But you didn't
give a shit.

838
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:55,388
You could've saved me.

839
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:02,457
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

840
01:16:02,593 --> 01:16:04,871
Do you know
what she'd do to me...

841
01:16:05,006 --> 01:16:07,181
before she'd hit me?

842
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:09,009
Like the day of the fire?

843
01:16:13,179 --> 01:16:15,388
It was right after
my birthday party.

844
01:16:15,524 --> 01:16:18,423
You'd just left for another
one of your... business trips.

845
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:23,974
It was just me and Mom.

846
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:26,492
All my new presents in the room.

847
01:16:30,972 --> 01:16:33,871
Daddy's gone...

848
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,664
and it's just you and me.

849
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,905
Hmm. Mama doesn't
need Daddy anyway.

850
01:16:43,006 --> 01:16:45,354
Mama only needs you.

851
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:52,078
Mama loves her baby.

852
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:03,354
When she was done...

853
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:05,733
she said that
I made her do it.

854
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:08,974
That I was dirty.

855
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,836
I was filthy.

856
01:17:15,662 --> 01:17:17,871
It was my fault...

857
01:17:18,006 --> 01:17:20,181
that it happened.

858
01:17:25,627 --> 01:17:27,561
When she left,
I heard her lock my door.

859
01:17:27,696 --> 01:17:30,940
Mommy? Mommy?

860
01:17:31,075 --> 01:17:33,009
Mommy, I can't open the door.

861
01:17:35,075 --> 01:17:37,802
Mommy! Mommy!

862
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:05,285
Come on. Hey.

863
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,250
Don't-- don't be sad.

864
01:18:10,696 --> 01:18:12,492
I hate it when you're sad.

865
01:18:17,144 --> 01:18:18,802
Everything's gonna be fine.

866
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,147
Mama loves her baby.

867
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:24,181
Mama loves her baby.

868
01:18:30,868 --> 01:18:32,940
But...

869
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,009
he's dirty.

870
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:38,630
He's filthy,

871
01:18:38,765 --> 01:18:41,388
and he should have
died in that fire.

872
01:18:46,282 --> 01:18:47,905
What did you say?

873
01:18:50,972 --> 01:18:52,802
Huh?

874
01:18:54,834 --> 01:18:55,836
I love you.

875
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:57,767
I came back!
I saved you!

876
01:19:57,903 --> 01:19:59,767
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Seth!

877
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:03,905
Oh, God!

878
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:12,767
Take him! Take him!

879
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:42,216
Y-you should've
let me die.

880
01:20:47,662 --> 01:20:49,388
You should've let me die!

881
01:22:01,903 --> 01:22:03,940
I imagine that,
when I was born,

882
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:07,181
my Father felt that unconditional
joy of a baby's birth,

883
01:22:07,317 --> 01:22:10,871
because he didn't know then that what
the future would hold for his child,

884
01:22:11,006 --> 01:22:14,354
for any child,
is an unanswerable question.

885
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,492
The summer that I was
six years old,

886
01:22:23,627 --> 01:22:27,940
my mother locked me in my
bedroom and set the house on fire.

887
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:30,457
I don't dream of
that night anymore.

888
01:22:30,593 --> 01:22:33,457
But I still hear her voice.

889
01:22:33,593 --> 01:22:36,871
"Mama loves her baby.
Mama loves her baby."
