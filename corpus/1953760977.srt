01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:51,073
Consider yourself very
fortunate, Mr. White.

917
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,542
No outsider has ever been
where you are.

918
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:54,843
That makes you the first.

919
01:01:54,845 --> 01:02:00,782
Yes, and right now you're
under the ride
Spaceship Earth.

920
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:03,118
What we call Base 21.

921
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,456
I'm still at Epcot?
- But where else?

922
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,925
Oh, I must apologize for
those.

923
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:13,428
But, you see, I had no idea
what sort of condition you'd
be in.

924
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,864
It's been so long.

925
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:19,334
Who are you?
[glass clattering]

926
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:21,503
Consider me a friend.

927
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,038
You work for D[bleep]ny?

928
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,741
No, and fortunately for you,

929
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:28,076
they are unaware of my
existence.

930
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,444
Unless, of course, the
French take--

931
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:32,280
Oh, they are
the most dangerous.

932
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,317
You see, I am a servant
of the Siemens Corporation.

933
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:37,052
What?!

934
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,153
Siemens.

935
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:42,124
The enterprise which
sponsors this attraction.

936
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,369
[alarm beeping]

937
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:57,839
Computer, begin the scan.

938
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,843
[screaming]

939
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,150
You've got quite
an imagination!

940
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:12,854
Just like old W himself.

941
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,256
He died...

942
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:17,959
...while all this was still
in its early stages.

943
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:22,864
Epcot's real purpose
remains unfinished.

944
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:25,767
[voice distorted]
You're inside my head!

945
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:29,204
Not your head, Jim.
in your imagination.

946
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:32,707
But we don't want to control
it like they do.

947
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:34,509
We simply monitor things,

948
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:37,112
so we can know what they're
up to and keep tabs.

949
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,183
[distorted voice]
Who is that?

950
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:43,084
That's you.

951
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:44,586
What?!

952
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,354
Only that's the real you,

953
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:50,091
in a part of your imagination
you've never sought to use.

954
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:52,194
Turn it off, please!
Please!

955
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:54,830
Something's not right.

956
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,037
Didn't your boss relay
the message when
you spoke to him?

957
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,307
My boss?
What are you talking about?

958
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,942
He was instructed to remind
you...

959
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,610
...you were to take the boy.

960
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:10,679
And Security was to meet
you, after the ride,

961
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,848
at the Land Pavilion.

962
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,551
Do you know how much
depends on this?!

963
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:20,188
We even had to shut down
the Buzz Lightyear!

964
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,591
Excuse me for a moment.

965
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:26,228
[doors whooshing]

966
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,708
Geosporic.

967
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,345
[man on monitor]
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's over there.

968
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,458
[liquid spurting]

969
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,950
[popping sounds]

970
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,603
Jim?

971
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,639
[electricity crackling]

972
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,977
Holy crap!

973
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:51,279
You're a robot.

974
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:55,283
[voice distorted]
I was trying to help you...

975
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,055
[alarm blaring]

976
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,796
[grunting and straining]

977
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:17,706
[cell phone ringing]

978
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:20,141
Yeah?
- Jim, listen to me.

979
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,911
Don't let your imagination
run wild.
- What did you do with her?!

980
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:24,679
It's a transitional period.

981
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,815
Just tell me where she is!

982
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:28,650
I can't really discuss
it right now.

983
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,385
Come on, you son of a bitch!

984
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:31,953
Sorry old boy.
I'm just a messenger.

985
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:33,822
Where are you?!
Goddammit you!

986
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:37,058
Best of luck!
- Wait, no!

987
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,929
[breathing heavily]

988
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:44,699
[fireworks exploding]

989
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,277
Sorry.
Sorry.

990
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,997
Sara?

991
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,704
[Sara's voice echoing]
Run faster.

992
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,440
Sara, is that you?!

993
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:33,014
Sweetie, honey,
where are you?

994
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,488
[Sara]
You can't get me.

995
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,524
Sara?

996
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,837
[Sara laughing]

997
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,079
[Sara]
Over here!

998
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,641
Jim!

999
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:38,313
[Jim yelling incoherently]

1000
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,983
Get off my dad!
Someone help!

1001
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,220
What's wrong with you Mr?!

1002
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,889
You made me...
drop my turkey leg!

1003
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,924
It's emu!
- Huh?

1004
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:53,194
Oh Christ.

1005
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,216
Sara, thank God.

1006
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,753
Huh?

1007
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:29,424
Okay, we're almost ready!

1008
01:10:29,426 --> 01:10:31,326
Where is she?

1009
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,996
What's going on?

1010
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:36,998
How did you get in here?

1011
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,767
Why are you dressed
like that?
- What do you mean?

1012
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,903
You took her didn't you?
- Benji, come here!

1013
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,172
Sorry, I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

1014
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:45,640
If you even touched her!

1015
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:47,242
Okay, now you're starting
to scare me.

1016
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:48,910
I think you should
leave before...

1017
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:51,279
Before what?
- Before my husband
gets back.

1018
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:52,280
Husband?!

1019
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:54,148
You're not even married,
are you?
- Get out!

1020
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,084
What's in the bedroom?
- I'm warning you!

1021
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,166
Sara.

1022
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:14,035
Oh, God!

1023
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,606
[Sara giggles]

1024
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,508
You're okay?

1025
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,977
Hi, Daddy.

1026
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,613
That was fun!
- Fun?

1027
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,582
Un-huh.
Can we do it again?

1028
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:29,350
Again?!
- Sorry, sweetie.

1029
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:31,853
I don't think your dad
would like it too much.

1030
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:34,088
But I'm still thirsty!

1031
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,425
Did she give you something?
- Relax, it's just sparkling
apple juice.

1032
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:40,528
It's just pretend.

1033
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,163
Are you out of your mind?

1034
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:45,266
You don't just take
someone's kid.
- I always bring them back.

1035
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:48,069
Bring them back?
- Some people don't
even notice.

1036
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:50,104
Jesus Christ.

1037
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,940
Wait!
Jim, wait!

1038
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,876
Have you even seen
someone decapitated?

1039
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,347
What?
- It's not like in the
movies.

1040
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,959
That's a pretty dress.

1041
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:14,462
It happens here,
occasionally.

1042
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,331
Last time
on Thunder Mountain.

1043
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,367
I can't feel my teeth.

1044
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:21,836
People just come here
'cos they wanna feel safe.

1045
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,037
They're afraid!

1046
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,408
But you can't escape it,
you know.

1047
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,744
Bad things
happen everywhere.

1048
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,947
Especially here.

1049
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,849
You're a witch.
- No!

1050
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:38,619
I'm a princess.
Or at least, I used to be.

1051
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:41,989
Happy day all of you!
I love you!

1052
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:45,159
I'm so happy to be here
with you!

1053
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:47,829
My beautiful princes
and princesses!

1054
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:50,965
Hello, Princess Minnie,
you beautiful angel.

1055
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,934
Keep smiling.

1056
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:56,971
Another beautiful princess.
Hello darling.

1057
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:01,209
I used to be one of them
a long time ago.

1058
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:04,112
Back when I was young
and beautiful.

1059
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:07,014
And it was magical.

1060
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:10,118
'til one day I saw
this little girl.

1061
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:14,355
She was so perfect,
like your daughter.

1062
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:15,790
Like Sara?

1063
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:18,960
So I wrapped my arms
around her.

1064
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:21,496
But then something
happened.

1065
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:24,699
When you're a princess,
they teach you to smile.

1066
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:29,937
Be cheery, merry, jovial.
And you can never be sad.

1067
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:32,940
Never ever!

1068
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,877
Then something happened.
I couldn't let go.

1069
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:38,179
Help!
I can't breathe!
[neck breaks]

1070
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:42,150
Oh no, princesses must
never cry!
[indistinct]

1071
01:13:42,152 --> 01:13:43,684
Hey, what are you doing
to my daughter?!

1072
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:44,986
Let go of her!
- Stop it!

1073
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:47,688
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Let her go!

1074
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,825
But you can't be happy all
the time.

1075
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:53,761
It's just not possible.

1076
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:59,934
And you know smiling's not
good...for the wrinkles.

1077
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,175
And I hate happy endings.

1078
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:09,777
Hate's a bad word!

1079
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,113
[glass shattering]
That's mine!

1080
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,117
You're sick, you know that?!

1081
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,686
Haven't you ever had a
fantasy, Jim?

1082
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:21,255
Daddy, let's go home.

1083
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,257
Thank you for playing with
me, Sara.

1084
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:25,326
You're a very sweet little
girl.

1085
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,862
Like a princess?
- Yes, darling... wait!

1086
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:30,198
Your balloon!

1087
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,133
You don't want to forget it.
- Look daddy!

1088
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:35,770
Goodbye, Jim!

1089
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,942
[announcer on loud speaker]
Welcome you aboard
