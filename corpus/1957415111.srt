1
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:08,586
- Thanks again boss.

2
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:09,834
It's a pleasure doing business with ya.

3
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:11,167
Have a good one.

4
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,684
Hey pretty bird, how are you pretty bird?

5
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,166
- We all know that Creutzfeldt-Jakob

6
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,919
is cow to man.

7
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,622
West Nile mosquito to man.

8
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:23,557
Now Ebola, some believe is monkey to man.

9
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,583
Others believe the culprit was a bat.

10
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,885
20 years later, we still
don't know for sure.

11
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:33,095
But what we do know is that
new viruses are natures

12
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:37,049
bioterrorists hijacking animal hosts...

13
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,009
Hmm, encephalitis?

14
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:50,106
Could be a reaction to
my dynamic personality.

15
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:54,852
Either one have been known to
cause periods of deep sleep.

16
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,678
Hello.

17
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,627
And our time is up.

18
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:07,188
Do have a pleasant holiday.

19
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,547
Relax your brains, come back refreshed.

20
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:12,818
If any of you have any
questions over the break,

21
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,365
here's my email address.

22
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:18,032
Lindaatthebeachdontbotherme.com.

23
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,219
Okay, have a great spring break.

24
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,949
Be careful out there, thank you.

25
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,895
- Pleasure doing business with you.

26
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,853
Thanks boss, see you around.

27
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:01,959
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,646
welcome to Barsarato Island.

29
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:06,043
The local time is 9:45.

30
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,132
Please remain seated with
your safety belts fastened

31
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:12,299
until the captain has turned
off the seat belt sign.

32
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,473
- What did they, close the island?

33
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,549
Where is everybody?

34
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,073
- They're all hiding so they don't see you

35
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,490
vacationing with your mother.

36
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:38,971
- Welcome to Barsarato
Island Dr. Flemming.

37
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:41,682
- Well thank you very much!

38
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,906
How did you know it was me?

39
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,263
- Let's just say you have
an excellent travel agent.

40
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,396
You enjoy your stay on the island now.

41
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:49,397
- Oh, I'm sure we will.

42
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:50,980
Thank you, bye bye.

43
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,583
- Here, I'll take that.

44
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,490
- Oh no, we're alright, thanks.

45
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,775
- You want a cab, right?

46
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,181
I'll take ya to your hotel

47
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,350
or I'll give ya a tour of
the island for a good price.

48
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,194
What do ya say?

49
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:05,564
- Actually, I think
somebody from the hotel's

50
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:06,589
gonna be picking us up.

51
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:07,450
- That's right.

52
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,914
- Well, you could be out here all day.

53
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:10,242
Is that what you want?

54
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,909
- We're fine really.

55
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,216
- It's alright Mr. Banes,
I'll take care of 'em.

56
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,126
- Take a hike kid, they're mine.

57
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:23,066
- They're staying at our hotel.

58
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,118
Dr. Flemming, Kathy
Johnson from the hotel.

59
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,144
- So good to meet you.

60
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:26,985
- Sorry I'm late.

61
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,719
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

62
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,719
- Look, is it Mr. Banes?

63
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,735
Perhaps another time, thank you.

64
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,397
Well, that was pleasant.

65
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:43,534
- Sorry, it's my fault.

66
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,725
I should've been here on time.

67
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,058
- Oh here, let me get those.

68
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,781
- I don't believe it.

69
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,942
Please leave me alone.

70
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:03,580
Hello?

71
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,413
Yes.

72
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:05,685
- So, you wanna dive today?

73
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,266
- Sure, the sooner the better.

74
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,933
- Good 'cause I'm takin' ya.

75
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,057
My Dad owns the hotel
and I'm his dive master.

76
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:13,498
Got the tanks ready to go.

77
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,165
- Oh, rock and roll.

78
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,526
- So, vacationing with your mom, huh?

79
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:19,687
What's that like?

80
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:20,608
- It's not so bad.

81
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:21,992
She usually behaves herself.

82
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:25,078
Maybe your mom can keep
her busy, distract her.

83
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:26,828
- My mom passed away.

84
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,438
What, like you were supposed to know?

85
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,241
- No but I'm sorry.

86
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:34,625
- No, no, forget about it.

87
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,244
It happens all the time.

88
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:39,137
People just assume, ya know?

89
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,265
- Yeah.

90
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:43,433
- First thing we gotta do is
get that thing away from her

91
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,946
and then bury it.

92
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,389
- You ever try taking a pork
chop away from a coyote?

93
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,222
- Ouch.

94
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:00,726
Welcome to beautiful downtown Barsarato,

95
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,927
an island with a dark and hideous past.

96
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,510
- Oh really, in what way?

97
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,768
- Oh come on Ma, everybody
knows Godzilla was born here.

98
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,702
- That was another
island just east of here,

99
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:10,074
the one that glows in the dark.

100
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:10,997
- Oh right.

101
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,435
- No ya know, Columbus
stopped here on his way

102
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:13,513
to the new world.

103
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:14,829
He took one look at this place and said,

104
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,008
"Wow, what a beautiful island.

105
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:18,798
"Let's kill everybody."

106
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,608
And they did, they
slaughtered the inhabitants

107
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,613
and then, took everything they had.

108
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:24,341
- Geez, what was his problem?

109
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:25,577
- Tours from hell.

110
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:28,219
- The next group of people
to come were the slaves.

111
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:30,295
They were forced to harvest the salt crop.

112
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:32,217
Ya know, most of the salt
used by the civilized world

113
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,166
came from this island.

114
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,057
- I don't remember reading any of this

115
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,065
in your hotel brochure.

116
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,940
- Well, we were afraid we
would attract the wrong

117
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,010
kind of people.

118
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,177
- Wise choice.

119
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,515
- Cool band.

120
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:08,939
- Everybody's so laid back.

121
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,153
It's great huh?

122
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:11,321
- This is paradise.

123
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,261
Ya know, we have people that
come here all stressed out

124
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:15,345
and they just never leave.

125
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,461
We have banking executives
working here as waiters

126
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:18,697
just so they could stay.

127
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,649
It's so totally cool.

128
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,593
- Alright, that's it Mom, I'm staying.

129
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,481
Send the rest of my stuff, will ya?

130
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,761
- Can I have your room?

131
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:25,678
- Right on.

132
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,775
- Poppy, I didn't hit him, did I?

133
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:51,727
- We need an ambulance.

134
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,977
Somebody call an ambulance.

135
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:58,796
Do you have a hospital here?

136
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,213
- Yes, what's wrong with him?

137
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:05,328
Just step back, both of you.

138
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,245
Do you know this man?

139
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,458
- Everybody knows Poppy.

140
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,557
- So he lives around the island.

141
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:13,576
He has family here?

142
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:14,409
- Yes.

143
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:16,954
- Poppy?

144
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:17,803
Poppy, just relax.

145
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:18,738
I'm a doctor.

146
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,004
An ambulance is on the way.

147
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,504
Leave him.

148
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:24,840
Excuse me?

149
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,244
- Leave him alone please.

150
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:27,262
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey.

151
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,142
- Back off.

152
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,310
- It is a good son who
protects his mother.

153
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,027
Now step back.

154
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:32,860
- What are you doing?

155
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,693
Don't touch him!

156
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:34,867
- Linda, it's okay, this is Joseph.

157
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,768
- I don't care who he is.

158
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:36,872
This man is seriously ill.

159
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,284
He could be highly contagious.

160
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:39,299
- You a doctor?

161
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,549
- That's right.

162
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,222
Listen to me.

163
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:46,717
You are putting yourself in danger.

164
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,491
Where are you taking him?

165
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,715
I'm asking you a question!

166
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,798
Where are you taking him?

167
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,373
Who is that man?

168
00:09:58,373 --> 00:09:59,206
- Joseph.

169
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,316
- Who is Joseph?

170
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,747
- He's a leader of a religious
group called The Faithful.

171
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:05,560
They practice natural medicine.

172
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,210
Ya know, herbs and stuff.

173
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,030
He's healed a lot of people.

174
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,218
You know this for a fact?

175
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:13,135
It's what everybody says.

176
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,288
- Hello.

177
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,796
Welcome to the Tropics Hotel.

178
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:41,886
- This is my father.

179
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,243
Dad, this is Dr. Flemming
and this is Will.

180
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,219
- Mr. Johnson.

181
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,801
- Please, call me Paul.

182
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,328
We're really casual around here.

183
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,969
- Oh, alright then.

184
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:50,814
Linda.

185
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:51,647
- Linda.

186
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:53,812
And you must be Will.

187
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:54,645
- Sir.

188
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,478
- Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:56,311
- Hi.

190
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,445
- Well let's get you folks settled in.

191
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:59,489
- We had a near miss on the road.

192
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,337
- What happened?

193
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:01,802
- It wasn't your daughter's fault.

194
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:04,290
This man collapsed in the
street right in front of us.

195
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,161
- It was Poppy.

196
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,008
I missed running over him by about a foot.

197
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:07,955
- Was he hurt?

198
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:10,558
- I don't think so,
just sick or something.

199
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:12,100
Joseph was there and he took him away.

200
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,794
- Well I'll check on Poppy
later, see if he's okay.

201
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:16,120
Let's get you folks settled
in, then maybe we can all

202
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,469
sit down, have a bite to eat.

203
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,006
- Oh no Dad, I'm gonna
take Will scuba diving.

204
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,089
It's the best time at South Reed.

205
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,496
- Will, could you take our bags up?

206
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:23,456
- Yeah.

207
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:24,289
- Come on.

208
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,120
- Good to meet ya.

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,327
- Good to meet you too.

210
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,989
- What a nice boy.

211
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,267
- I'd like to pay a
visit to your hospital.

212
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,192
- You're not feeling well?

213
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,700
- No, no, it's not that.

214
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,376
- Well, I can drive you myself.

215
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,707
- Would you?

216
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:37,550
- Sure.

217
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,558
- I appreciate that.

218
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:39,891
- Sure, come on.

219
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,704
I meant to ask you, is your
husband gonna be joining you?

220
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:49,013
- I don't think so.

221
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,350
He went out for a walk
about seven years ago

222
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,453
and I haven't seen him since.

223
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,919
I did get a post card
though from Brazil saying,

224
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,741
"Hi, having a wonderful time,

225
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:59,076
"glad you're not here.

226
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,076
"Send Will."

227
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:02,778
I didn't.

228
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,076
- I see.

229
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,274
- Are you sure?

230
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,244
He's an older man.

231
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,030
People call him Poppy?

232
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,863
- Poppy?

233
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,803
- The bald guy that sells chickens

234
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,435
by the side of the main road.

235
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:27,226
- Oh yes, of course, but
he would never come here.

236
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,971
Has something happened to him?

237
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,783
- Well yeah, he collapsed in the street

238
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:34,284
and I'm just concerned
because I noticed that he had

239
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:36,967
open lesions and dried scabs.

240
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,225
- Are you sure?

241
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,198
- I'm quite sure.

242
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:40,877
My field is virology.

243
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:43,202
A man named Joseph took him away.

244
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:45,548
Is there some other medical
facility on the island?

245
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,251
- No, there isn't.

246
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:49,738
- Joseph would not take
him anywhere near a doctor.

247
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,308
I mean, he believes in
folk medicine and prayer.

248
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:54,913
So do a lot of other
people on this island.

249
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,213
- I see.

250
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:59,012
Look, could you do me a
favor and if this man Poppy

251
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,631
does come in, could you call me?

252
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,049
I'm at the Tropics Hotel.

253
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,105
- Of course.

254
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:04,414
Dr. Flemming.

255
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,414
- Thank you.

256
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:13,234
So, you know this Joseph?

257
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:15,206
- Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

258
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,737
- Where can I find him?

259
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:17,998
- He lives on the other
side of the island.

260
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,807
I can take you there if you'd like.

261
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:20,775
- Well, wait a minute.

262
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:25,428
Aren't you supposed to be
running a hotel or something?

263
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:27,407
- It practically runs itself.

264
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,240
- Sounds like you really
know how to delegate.

265
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:46,719
- You clean it and I'll start a fire.

266
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,302
- What, why do I have to clean it?

267
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:49,738
- Because I caught it.

268
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,310
You wanna eat, you have to work.

269
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,030
- Two people swim up to
you with a spear, right?

270
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,363
What were you thinking? Duh.

271
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,582
- So, how long have you known Joseph?

272
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,510
- Well, I met him when we first arrived.

273
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,952
He welcomed us.

274
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,874
He's quite a remarkable guy.

275
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,492
Ya know, he was a champion free diver.

276
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,763
Several years ago, he was here on vacation

277
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:20,801
and on one of his deepest dives, he had a

278
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,551
religious experience.

279
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,738
So much so that the next
day, he quit his job

280
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:28,759
and started his own religious movement.

281
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,592
- Wow.

282
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:32,602
- Yeah, he has quite a few followers.

283
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,935
- Very powerful looking man.

284
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:37,758
- Well, he was a record holder.

285
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:41,437
You won't hear him talking about it.

286
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:43,790
- Your daughter mentioned
that he has a reputation

287
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,906
for being a healer?

288
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:49,911
- Yeah, he's helped quite a few people.

289
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:50,804
Me included.

290
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:51,637
- Really?

291
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,339
- Well, not me actually.

292
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,172
My wife.

293
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,241
- Your wife?

294
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:01,645
- She died.

295
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,750
- Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,877
- I never knew anything
could taste so good.

297
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:14,102
- Glad you liked it.

298
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:15,038
- What's not to like?

299
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,446
You got the ocean view, the surf

300
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:19,946
and great weather and no smog.

301
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,105
- What else?

302
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,864
We're gonna kiss sooner or later.

303
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,014
- This does not look good.

304
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:05,080
- You sure it's a virus?

305
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,770
Maybe it's something else.

306
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,185
- We need to get them to the hospital.

307
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,450
Who knows how far it's spread?

308
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,617
Look, whatever you do, don't
touch any of these people.

309
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,291
- Joseph.

310
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,083
Joseph.

311
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,638
- My friend.

312
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,543
- I'm sorry to, I'm sorry
to intrude like this but,

313
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:39,245
I brought someone to see you.

314
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,717
- Doctor.

315
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,641
- You have a serious problem here.

316
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,741
- Yes, it would appear so.

317
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,787
- These people need medical care.

318
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:49,287
Now, I'm sure Paul and I could
arrange for transportation

319
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:50,458
to the hospital.

320
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,115
- That won't be necessary doctor.

321
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:54,071
We'll be quite alright here.

322
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:55,180
- Look around you.

323
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,015
Do you see what's happening?

324
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,432
This is what a viral outbreak looks like.

325
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:03,095
- This island has had it's share

326
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:05,711
of tropical illnesses, doctor.

327
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:07,727
We managed to survive.

328
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,894
I'm sure this one will be no
different than the others.

329
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:14,685
- You're not well.

330
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,181
- It will pass.

331
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,785
- That lesion points
to something far worse

332
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:21,180
than anything you may have ever had.

333
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,315
- Joseph, maybe it'd be a good idea.

334
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,565
Just this once.

335
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:27,904
- It's alright.

336
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:29,376
I appreciate your concern, my friend,

337
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:31,043
and I'll love you for it.

338
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:33,410
But God will look after us.

339
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,009
- I'd like to see the man we were trying

340
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:36,926
to help earlier, Poppy.

341
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,207
- Poppy's resting.

342
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:40,198
Perhaps tomorrow.

343
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:41,878
- No, you don't understand.

344
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,141
He may be the one responsible
for bringing the virus

345
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:44,974
to the island.

346
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,597
I need to know where he's
been and how many people

347
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:47,839
he's been in contact with.

348
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,121
- Again, I appreciate your concern but...

349
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:53,735
- Sir, I respect your beliefs, I do.

350
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:55,966
But when your actions affect
the health and well being

351
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:59,371
of other people, something has to be done.

352
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,557
- We threaten no one.

353
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:03,252
- Forgive me for saying this
sir, but you are being foolish.

354
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,947
Now I am very aware of the benefits

355
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:06,676
that can be derived
from natural medicines.

356
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:08,176
I've used them myself.

357
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:11,433
But always in conjunction
with modern science.

358
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:14,783
Now please, isn't there
some way that we could

359
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:15,950
work together?

360
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,643
- I'm sorry.

361
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,227
- I see.

362
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,081
You're not particularly
interested in helping people,

363
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,989
you just wanna keep
them under your control.

364
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:24,822
- Linda.

365
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:25,830
- I don't care, I'm sorry.

366
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,008
But this man could end up being
responsible for the deaths

367
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,496
of everyone in this compound.

368
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,330
- Joseph, what would it hurt?

369
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,173
Just this once.

370
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:36,590
I mean, God will still be here with them.

371
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:40,321
- It's time for you to go.

372
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,892
I appreciate your concern my friend.

373
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:43,725
Doctor.

374
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,680
- You're not well, Joseph.

375
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,930
You're not going to be healing anybody!

376
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,029
- May God bless you and keep you.

377
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,303
- Yes, I'd like the number for the

378
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,469
Center for Disease Control
of Atlanta, Georgia please.

379
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:12,743
- I'll be leaving in a week and

380
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:15,378
I really wish I didn't have to.

381
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:16,211
- Me too.

382
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,608
I guess I shouldn't feel
this way about someone

383
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:22,210
I've only known for a few hours.

384
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,766
- It's crazy isn't it?

385
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,683
- But nice.

386
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:27,807
- Yeah.

387
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:33,471
I don't know, maybe
there's some way we can.

388
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,325
- Maybe, I mean, it's not like you live

389
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,614
on another planet, right?

390
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:39,449
- You've never been to Los Angeles.

391
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,282
- Right.

392
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,521
It's not like you don't
have summer vacations.

393
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:44,354
- Yeah.

394
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:47,730
- Well, if you wanna make some money,

395
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,958
then my Dad could give
you a job at the hotel.

396
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,791
- Really?

397
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,629
That would be so cool.

398
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,761
- Kathy was with you when
you helped Poppy, right?

399
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,611
- Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

400
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,044
Keep an eye on her.

401
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,171
Tell me if she shows
any signs of symptoms,

402
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:20,104
a headache, respiratory
problems, anything at all.

403
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:20,937
- I will.

404
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:24,407
- Hey Dad!

405
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,811
- Hey, Kathy, are you okay honey?

406
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,657
- What do you mean?

407
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:30,034
Of course I'm okay, why?

408
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,292
- Come here.

409
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,858
- Do you have a headache
or any kind of discomfort?

410
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,102
- No.

411
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,791
Nothing, I'm a little tired.

412
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,068
- We had a great time out there Mom.

413
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,270
It's awesome, you have
to go with us next time.

414
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,186
- I will, it sounds like fun.

415
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:43,663
- You sure you're feeling okay?

416
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,022
- Yeah! Why?

417
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:46,455
- Oh nothing, just being my regular

418
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,872
overprotective self, I guess.

419
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:52,265
- Look, why don't we all get
together later and have dinner?

420
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:54,620
Unless you have other plans.

421
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,287
- No, sounds lovely.

422
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:00,519
- Okay, see ya later honey.

423
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,602
- Yes mother.

424
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,973
- She looks okay to me.

425
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,932
- I think she's gonna be fine.

426
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:10,404
Good.

427
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:11,404
- Excuse me.

428
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:13,401
Yes?

429
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:16,584
How many patients have you admitted

430
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,917
with those symptoms, doctor?

431
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,313
How long has he been symptomatic?

432
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,873
- 24 hours.

433
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:28,167
Started with a headache, then a fever.

434
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,504
- It's hard to tell with this equipment

435
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,622
but it's probably a virus.

436
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:33,875
Can we get those samples
out to the CDC tonight?

437
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,545
- Yes, we can put them on the next flight.

438
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,290
- What kinda virus is it?

439
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,789
- That's gonna take some research.

440
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,977
I have never seen anything like this.

441
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:45,507
I'm gonna need a sample of Poppy's blood.

442
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:46,786
Make sure we're dealing with the same set

443
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:49,110
of viral characteristics.

444
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,645
Also gonna have to go
back to Joseph's again.

445
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,832
But this time, I want the police with me.

446
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:56,664
- That serious huh?

447
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:57,497
- Yeah.

448
00:21:58,932 --> 00:21:59,765
Could be.

449
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,167
- Put that away.

450
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:12,783
This is fresh from our
garden, lovingly hand-prepared

451
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:14,157
for you and your mother.

452
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,390
- Oh, she can't make it.

453
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,040
- I know, my Dad called.

454
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,265
But you have to tell her how good it is.

455
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:19,277
I wanna impress her.

456
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:20,307
- I will.

457
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:21,719
I was just sittin' here
thinking if I don't eat soon,

458
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,041
I'm gonna die.

459
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,623
- Parents don't seem to
realize that we have like

460
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:26,149
supersonic metabolisms.

461
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:28,369
If we don't eat every 12
minutes, then a body part

462
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:29,619
just falls off.

463
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,618
- What's wrong?

464
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:38,409
- Ugh, too much sun I guess.

465
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,668
Getting a headache.

466
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:40,745
- Here, sit down.

467
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:43,183
- Oh, don't you start too, I'm fine.

468
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:44,600
Move your napkin.

469
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,064
- Mmm, this looks fabulous.

470
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:50,555
Everything's so fresh here.

471
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:53,097
It's like this whole island's
one big health food place.

472
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,769
- People don't get sick here hardly.

473
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:57,703
That's why this thing
with Poppy is kinda scary.

474
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:00,881
What if this thing is really serious?

475
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,775
- I don't know, it's probably
just the flu or something.

476
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:09,909
- That's what Poppy had.

477
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,826
I've got it.

478
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,309
- Kathy.

479
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,736
- I've got it, Will.

480
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:16,569
- Kathy.

481
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,184
- No, stay away from me!

482
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:19,567
Stay away!

483
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,734
- Kathy, wait!

484
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:30,476
- Joseph?

485
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:33,464
Joseph.

486
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,520
- Where is everybody?

487
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,353
- Joseph!

488
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:43,432
- How soon before the police get here?

489
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:44,632
- 15, 20 minutes.

490
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,909
He said he was on the
other side of the island.

491
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:47,742
- He?

492
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,063
- Yeah, Bobby, he's our only...

493
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,328
- You have one policeman.

494
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:56,100
- Yeah, that's all we really need.

495
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,622
I mean, there's no real crime here.

496
00:23:57,622 --> 00:24:00,060
An occasional stolen chicken.

497
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,893
- Amazing.

498
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:05,403
- I feel badly about this.

499
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,711
I mean, bringing the cops,
even if it's just Bobby.

500
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:12,169
Joseph is gonna have a
hard time forgiving me.

501
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,349
- Tell me about this Joseph.

502
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:16,306
You say he helped your wife.

503
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:17,139
- Yeah.

504
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,103
My wife had cancer and

505
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,503
the doctors had done
all they could for her

506
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:31,657
and she was suffering terribly.

507
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,136
She loved this island.

508
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:39,279
We spent our honeymoon here.

509
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,462
So she asked me to bring her back here

510
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,879
and spend the rest of her life and I did.

511
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:51,906
When the pain got too
much for her to bear,

512
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:53,989
I took her to see Joseph.

513
00:24:55,993 --> 00:25:00,160
And he gave her three more
months of a pain free life.

514
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,505
She died at peace.

515
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:11,835
That I'll never be able to repay him.

516
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,642
- It's nice that he was there for her.

517
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:19,092
- Our brother has gone
on to the next world.

518
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:20,058
We will miss him.

519
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:21,403
Yes.

520
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,661
- The pain we feel is a good thing.

521
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,362
Yes.

522
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,195
- Embrace it.

523
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:29,294
It will teach us to
appreciate those we love

524
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,842
while they're still with us.

525
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,067
Yes.

526
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,567
- Poppy was loved.

527
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,531
No one could ask for more.

528
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,829
Some of you may ask, where was God

529
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,174
when Poppy was sick?

530
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,233
Right there.

531
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:45,927
- He was right there

532
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,790
with his hands out leading him home.

533
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,829
Let us send him to his final rest

534
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,746
with his favorite home.

535
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,310
- When did it happen?

536
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,684
- Just after you left today.

537
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:20,563
- I don't mean to be
contentious but now do you see

538
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:23,549
how very important it is that
your people go to the hospital

539
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,797
and get checked out?

540
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:27,596
- You listen but you not hear.

541
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,663
My people have no need of hospitals.

542
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:32,107
- Is God making house calls?

543
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:35,607
- Linda, would you excuse us for a minute?

544
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:43,680
- You like this woman?

545
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,696
- What?

546
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:46,313
Joseph, I just met her.

547
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,289
Yeah, I like her, so?

548
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,579
- It's time you love someone again.

549
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,707
- Well that may be true Joseph,

550
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:54,194
but that's not why we're here.

551
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:57,275
- On the contrary, it
is why we are all here.

552
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:00,405
- Look, I know what you're
doing and I appreciate it,

553
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,768
I really do.

554
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:04,023
But we need to get some blood from Poppy.

555
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,726
- Poppy is dead.

556
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,976
- Yeah, but he's available.

557
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,644
- Are you asking me if you can
take blood from a dead man?

558
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:14,599
- Joseph, you make it sound horrible.

559
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,886
She makes it sound scientific, but yes,

560
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,098
that's what I'm asking.

561
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:20,137
- Is this important?

562
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,387
- It is to her.

563
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:23,187
- And you?

564
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:24,354
- Look, I wanna help okay?

565
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:25,910
Let's just leave it at that.

566
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,595
She's a doctor and she wants to help us.

567
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:30,594
- Who?

568
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:32,081
- Us, everybody on the island.

569
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,155
Joseph, do you...

570
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:38,155
If Poppy has a virus, we
have to know what kind.

571
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:43,965
- You think she would stay
here with you, live here?

572
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:47,696
- I don't know, I
haven't thought about it.

573
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:51,422
Well, maybe I've thought
about it a little bit.

574
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:52,677
- They're waiting for me.

575
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:53,918
- Wait a second.

576
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,395
Are you gonna let her take the blood?

577
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:56,875
- You have to ask Poppy.

578
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,542
- Joseph, he's dead.

579
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:02,619
- Finally you have grasped
the heart of our problem.

580
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,015
- Look, we don't seem to be
making much progress here.

581
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:06,855
I need to take a blood sample from Poppy.

582
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:08,696
I'm happy to wait until
the services are over

583
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:09,799
but I have to do this.

584
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,799
- You have to ask Poppy.

585
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,802
- Joseph, it's obvious
that you have a fever.

586
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:17,552
You're getting worse!

587
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,053
Please let me help you!

588
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,223
Joseph!
- Linda.

589
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:25,378
- I don't understand this man.

590
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:28,602
- We're not gonna get
anywhere with him right now.

591
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,656
- What's happened?

592
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:36,537
- This is bad.

593
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,188
I have 20 patients with the same symptoms

594
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:39,855
and more on the way.

595
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,007
- No, please.

596
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,379
Not Kathy.

597
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,803
- No, not at the moment,

598
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:58,991
but if this thing
evolves, we're gonna need

599
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:01,160
the full cooperation from them, yeah.

600
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,084
Thank you very much.

601
00:29:03,084 --> 00:29:04,166
- What's up?

602
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:07,478
- We may have a stage five
virus alert on Barsarato Island.

603
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:08,533
- And where would that be?

604
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:10,775
- It's between Miami and Guantanamo.

605
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:12,372
It's one of our Caribbean territories.

606
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:13,205
Look it up.

607
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:14,114
- Wow, a stage five.

608
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,493
What's that? Ebola?

609
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:16,819
- Uh, I'm not sure yet but we
need to start thinking about

610
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,034
a quarantine.

611
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:18,985
- Population?

612
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,390
- About 2,000 people give or take.

613
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,606
I wanna be the first ones
through the door on this.

614
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,673
If it turns into something
bad, I want us to stop it

615
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:26,824
in it's tracks.

616
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:27,657
- Tell me what you want.

617
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,548
- I want a team on that
island as of yesterday.

618
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:30,852
That's number one.

619
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,207
There's a carrier group running
exercises near Guantanamo,

620
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,262
so if a containment issues
arises, we can use them.

621
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:39,266
Wanna know what all the
medical facilities are,

622
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:40,927
including the names of
all the medical personnel.

623
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:43,533
Find out as much as you can
about Dr. Linda Flemming.

624
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,718
She's the woman who
reported this thing to us.

625
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,926
It's my first time out as
Operation Supervisor so,

626
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:50,205
I'm gonna be all over this thing.

627
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,820
You ready?

628
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,939
- What about a press briefing?

629
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:54,833
- No, no, we keep this quiet.

630
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,836
You can put out travel warnings
but until this situation

631
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,777
is stabilized, I don't
wanna tell the press.

632
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:01,755
I don't want them
starting some major panic.

633
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:03,571
We
interrupt this program for a

634
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,954
channel six exclusive report.

635
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:09,024
Today, the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta

636
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,815
has ordered an emergency
team dispatched to an island

637
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:15,059
in the Caribbean called Barsarato.

638
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,359
- I have to find my mom.

639
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,936
I'll be back.

640
00:30:18,936 --> 00:30:19,975
The island has been hit

641
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:23,091
with a deadly, fast spreading
virus of unknown origin.

642
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:26,398
A full report will follow
after these messages.

643
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:27,898
- Daddy?

644
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:28,731
- What honey?

645
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:29,564
- Am I gonna die?

646
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:30,965
- No, sweetheart, you're not gonna die.

647
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:33,448
We're gonna get you better.

648
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:35,420
You listen to me.

649
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,587
I promised your mother that
you would have a good life.

650
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:43,937
That you would go to
college and one day meet

651
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:45,354
somebody special.

652
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,014
- I think I have.

653
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,375
- Will seems like a fine young man.

654
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,802
- I'm glad that you like him.

655
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:58,347
- Trust me honey, I'm gonna get you well.

656
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:01,110
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

657
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,943
I promise.

658
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,858
According
to Dr. Linda Flemming

659
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:10,832
who is on the island of
Barsarato, this virus is just as

660
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:13,214
deadly as the well-known Ebola virus

661
00:31:13,214 --> 00:31:16,369
and could possibly decimate
the entire island population

662
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:18,578
of over 2,000 people.

663
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:19,411
At this point...

664
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,048
- Who is responsible for this?

665
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,078
I haven't talked to
anybody except the CDC.

666
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:24,416
They're gonna panic the whole island!

667
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,418
- How'd they get your picture?

668
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:30,302
- This fax just came in from the CDC.

669
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:31,135
- Okay.

670
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:36,102
Viruses unknown.

671
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,019
Viruses, more than one.

672
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:42,406
Both containing prions,
proteins on the surface

673
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:45,364
of a suspected animal virus string.

674
00:31:45,364 --> 00:31:48,008
- That makes sense, there's
both poultry and cattle

675
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:49,175
on the island.

676
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,617
- Are any of the victims here farmers?

677
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:55,045
- Uh, you're thinkin' in big city terms.

678
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,325
- Yeah, here, most people keep chickens.

679
00:31:57,325 --> 00:32:00,487
Some have cattle and
everybody goes to the market.

680
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:01,636
- What about Poppy?

681
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:02,945
Where did he live?

682
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,098
- His chicken farm was
out by the lighthouse.

683
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:06,289
I can take you there.

684
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,344
- The CDC's gonna be here by tonight.

685
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,848
- That's okay, I'll be back by then.

686
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:11,107
Will, you stay here.

687
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:13,024
- Keep an eye on Kathy.

688
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,843
- Hello?

689
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:29,376
Hello.

690
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,052
Awfully quiet here isn't it?

691
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,126
- Yeah, especially for a chicken farm.

692
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:45,570
I think I've eaten my last drumstick.

693
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,487
- Well, we have to burn every coup.

694
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:55,372
- How bad is this virus?

695
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:56,657
- It's hard to say at this point.

696
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:58,467
They're unpredictable.

697
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,684
One of these days,
we're gonna run into one

698
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:00,951
that can't be stopped.

699
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:01,784
- Are you serious?

700
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,101
You mean like the end of the world?

701
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:05,048
- It's possible.

702
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,754
Certainly more likely
than a nuclear war or some

703
00:33:07,754 --> 00:33:10,494
meteor from outer space.

704
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:12,706
People don't realize,

705
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:14,546
40,000 Americans die every year

706
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:16,827
from type resistant germs.

707
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,910
It's a serious situation.

708
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,198
- I'm John Nevison, Dr.

709
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,531
I recognize you from the
picture on Channel six.

710
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:03,314
- I had nothing to do with that report.

711
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:04,302
I promise you.

712
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:05,458
- That's what they all say.

713
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,106
What are you angling for? A book deal?

714
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:09,335
- Now wait a minute, I'm
telling you the truth.

715
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:12,452
- Just so you know, I will
retain all rights to my name

716
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:15,785
and any photographs containing my image.

717
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:18,178
I'm joking.

718
00:34:18,178 --> 00:34:21,428
We can always count on the
media to screw things up.

719
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:22,863
- Yeah, but how did they find out?

720
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:26,531
- The CDC called Washington
and well, ya know Washington.

721
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,457
By now, everyone on the
planet knows we're here.

722
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:30,776
- Well let me show you
what we have and then

723
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:31,609
we'll take it from there.

724
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,479
What we do know for sure is
that the virus is not airborne.

725
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,312
- Good.

726
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,058
- Who talked to Channel six?

727
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:43,592
- I do not know.

728
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:44,574
- The White House just called.

729
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:45,923
They wanna know what's going on.

730
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:46,850
Who blabbed?

731
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,760
- It wasn't us.

732
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,792
Heck, it was probably somebody in the

733
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:49,755
Surgeon General's office.

734
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,146
- Will you find out who it was?

735
00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:54,313
If it was us, I want the leak plugged.

736
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:59,515
- Hi, Dr. Flemming, can you hear me?

737
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,378
I'm Susan Holme.

738
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:03,234
I'm the Operations
Supervisor here in Atlanta.

739
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,510
Can I first say how
fortunate we feel to have you

740
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,724
on the site and grateful
for any assistance

741
00:35:07,724 --> 00:35:08,992
you can offer us.

742
00:35:08,992 --> 00:35:11,180
And I need to apologize for the news leak.

743
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,396
- Yeah, that's caused quite
a few problems for us.

744
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:15,676
- Such as?

745
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,101
- People are gonna wanna leave the island,

746
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,730
people who are already infected.

747
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,293
- Of course we're gonna
help you screen everyone

748
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,767
for the infection.

749
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:22,990
As for people getting off the island,

750
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,571
we've already contacted the Navy regarding

751
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:26,189
a possible quarantine.

752
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:27,857
So rest assured that
they are fully equipped

753
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:30,332
and prepared for a situation like that.

754
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:32,834
- I have every confidence in the CDC.

755
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:35,180
We're starting to screen
everybody but it's hard

756
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,048
to get people in.

757
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:36,881
They're too afraid.

758
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:38,942
So, what are we gonna do about that?

759
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:40,729
- Well, we're gonna send
more CDC personnel in

760
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:43,438
and form groups and send
them around house to house.

761
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:45,652
We're gonna use the media to
inform people what's happening

762
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:47,425
and tell them why it's
important to be tested

763
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,007
before they can be evacuated.

764
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:51,546
We'll do that on a voluntary
basis as long as we can.

765
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:52,984
- Okay, that sounds good.

766
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,280
I'd like to talk longer, but
I really have to get moving.

767
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,488
- Understood.

768
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,418
Do the best you can.

769
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:59,388
If there's anything we can
do for you, we're here.

770
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:00,804
Pick up the phone, tell us what it is

771
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:02,152
and we'll send it to you.

772
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:03,734
- I appreciate that.

773
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,974
We'll send you data as
we continue to test.

774
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:08,725
- Good luck.

775
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:11,184
- We're gonna need it.

776
00:36:55,003 --> 00:36:55,836
- Mom.

777
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,404
- Will, you shouldn't be here honey.

778
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:03,961
- Why did you stop for that old man?

779
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:05,588
- What?

780
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:08,366
- Now I'm gonna die because of you.

781
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:10,889
- What are you talking about?

782
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,061
He was lying in the street.

783
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:13,140
He needed help.

784
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,307
- Look what you did to me.

785
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:20,144
Look what you did to me.

786
00:37:21,063 --> 00:37:23,063
Now we're all gonna die!

787
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:58,718
- You okay?

788
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:01,469
- Jet lag.

789
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:02,854
What's goin' on?

790
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:04,483
- We're losing people.

791
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:07,106
We lost four in the last two hours.

792
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:08,951
What I'm finding is that survival rate

793
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,992
has a lot to do with their general health

794
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:14,037
and how well their immune
system is functioning.

795
00:38:14,037 --> 00:38:15,947
Smokers, people with
impaired lung functions,

796
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:17,892
forget it, they'll be the first to go.

797
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:20,059
- Well, that makes sense.

798
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:21,309
People who take care of themselves

799
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:24,095
can have a better chance
to fight this thing.

800
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,273
- You look like you're
in pretty good shape.

801
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:27,053
- I wasn't talking about myself.

802
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:28,874
- I jog five miles a day.

803
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:32,391
Am I just a little happier
about that right now? Yeah.

804
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:34,520
Now the tricky part is, we
thought we were dealing with

805
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,270
two separate viruses.

806
00:38:37,457 --> 00:38:39,676
- What about now?

807
00:38:54,075 --> 00:38:56,189
Crowd forming
at North Creek Marina.

808
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:57,954
Alert Coast Guard.

809
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:50,318
This is a download
of a before and after scan

810
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:52,616
of the same virus.

811
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:54,319
- It's mutating.

812
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:58,419
- And this one is from a
victim we just brought in.

813
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:00,289
- I don't understand.

814
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,737
His T-cell count is excellent,
he's fighting the infection.

815
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,987
- Linda, that is the virus.

816
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,703
It's hijacking T-cells
using that as cover.

817
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,837
- If it looks like a healthy T-cell,

818
00:40:18,837 --> 00:40:21,985
we're not gonna know who's
infected and who's not

819
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,652
until it's too late.

820
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,746
- I think you know what this means.

821
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:30,574
- Yeah.

822
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:34,115
Have they notified Atlanta?

823
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,171
This is the Coast Guard.

824
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,323
Attention all boats.

825
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:12,443
Return to shore.

826
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:14,564
Return to shore!

827
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:57,762
- We're good to go.

828
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:00,103
- Good morning Miss Holme.

829
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,624
- Please call me Susan.

830
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:03,894
- Susan.

831
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:04,864
- Good morning Doctors.

832
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:06,413
I know you're very busy
but I think you need

833
00:42:06,413 --> 00:42:08,830
an overview of our situation.

834
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:13,391
This is an extrapolation
based on our data.

835
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:14,740
Are you getting this feed?

836
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,519
- Yeah, I see it.

837
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,066
- This marks the progress
of the virus in the first

838
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,187
12 hours.

839
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,332
The white dots represent
the reported infections

840
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,818
and the red dots are confirmed fatalities.

841
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:25,664
Now, because many of
the locals are not going

842
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:27,432
to the hospital, we've adjusted the rate

843
00:42:27,432 --> 00:42:28,762
to compensate for that.

844
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:31,481
But based at the present
rate of infection,

845
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:35,088
this is what it's gonna look
like in the next 12 hours.

846
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:36,671
And in the next 24.

847
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,107
And as yet, we don't know if
there's any infected people

848
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:42,695
that have made it to other
islands but if they have,

849
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:45,727
this is what we're looking at.

850
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:48,430
Haiti, Dominican Republic,
Cuba, these are all

851
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,415
economically deprived third world nations

852
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:52,028
with large populations.

853
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,956
Now how fast it moves into the states

854
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:56,646
is based on an immigration
illegal alien figure.

855
00:42:56,646 --> 00:43:00,813
If we're using a conservative
one infection over 100 ratio,

856
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,442
we're looking at tens of
thousands of cases in the U.S.

857
00:43:04,442 --> 00:43:06,591
alone over the next three months.

858
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:09,135
So as of now, doctors, we have no choice

859
00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:12,330
but to declare Barsarato
Island a wildfire hot zone

860
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,330
and enforce an immediate quarantine.

861
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:52,202
Coast
Guard 8-0-7-7 X-ray Adam.

862
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:53,523
- Onset one third eye.

863
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:55,079
Bring craft below 1,000 feet

864
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,651
and scan shoreline.

865
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:06,869
- U.S.
helicopters today prevented

866
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:09,494
a mass evacuation by panicked residents of

867
00:44:09,494 --> 00:44:13,023
Barsarato Island attempting
to beat the blockade.

868
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:15,162
Kilo,
one-six-five, proceed to

869
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:17,168
specified coordinates.

870
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:18,722
Military
patrols have been stepped up

871
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,424
and all local shipping
is being searched before

872
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:23,433
leaving the island waters.

873
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:25,334
Last night, a freighter
attempting to escape

874
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:28,089
under cover of darkness
was boarded and returned

875
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:29,471
to the harbor.

876
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,009
According to government
sources, the people of Barsarato

877
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:35,397
have now agreed to cooperate
fully with the quarantine.

878
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:38,522
As anxiety continues to
spread throughout the region,

879
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:40,127
local authorities...

880
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:03,602
- Is anybody hurt?

881
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:04,435
How badly?

882
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:07,982
My God, has everybody lost their minds?

883
00:45:07,982 --> 00:45:09,402
Alright, don't move them.

884
00:45:09,402 --> 00:45:11,150
I'll have somebody pick them up.

885
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,725
I need an ambulance to the airport.

886
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,879
Two of my people have been hurt.

887
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,933
- How, what happened?

888
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:16,862
- Now please.

889
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:17,862
- Of course.

890
00:45:19,223 --> 00:45:20,884
- Ambulance is on it's way.

891
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,356
This is totally unacceptable.

892
00:45:23,356 --> 00:45:25,674
Cancel all incoming CDC flights.

893
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:26,832
- No, wait.

894
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:29,989
- I'm going to tell them
to close the airport.

895
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:31,505
If those people grab one of these planes,

896
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:32,903
who knows where they'll end up.

897
00:45:32,903 --> 00:45:34,397
- You can't do that!

898
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:37,403
- I'll do the same, thank you.

899
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:39,116
- John, what happened?

900
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,265
- Okay look, I don't
want any of you to end up

901
00:45:42,265 --> 00:45:45,019
as hostages if this
thing turns into a riot.

902
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:45,970
I want you to talk to your team,

903
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,827
have them ready to move
at a moments notice.

904
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:49,472
I'm gonna have a chopper on ready alert

905
00:45:49,472 --> 00:45:51,999
and we'll come and get ya
soon as you say the word.

906
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,694
- Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

907
00:45:54,694 --> 00:45:55,527
Right.

908
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:59,015
They're afraid we'll be taken hostage

909
00:45:59,015 --> 00:46:00,744
by the people trying
to get off the island.

910
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:01,731
- Why? Why you?

911
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:02,729
Why not one of us?

912
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:04,500
- We're government personnel.

913
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,262
Taking one of us would force
Washington to deal with it.

914
00:46:07,262 --> 00:46:08,494
- I don't believe this is happening.

915
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:10,693
Don't they understand we need you here?

916
00:46:10,693 --> 00:46:13,110
- They're well aware of that.

917
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:14,970
- Great.

918
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,177
My summer vacation, by
the late Linda Flemming.

919
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,682
- Help me, please!

920
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,876
- Kathy, what is it?

921
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:48,295
Do you want me to get the nurse?

922
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:49,128
- No.

923
00:46:50,665 --> 00:46:52,415
Take me to the beach.

924
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,816
- What are you talking about?

925
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:56,176
- Please William.

926
00:46:56,176 --> 00:46:58,538
I don't wanna die here.

927
00:46:58,538 --> 00:47:00,200
- Kathy, I can't.

928
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,460
You're gonna be alright.

929
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,093
- No I'm not.

930
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:05,332
They're all dying and so am I.

931
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:07,165
- No, that's not true.

932
00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:11,756
My mother and all these government people

933
00:47:11,756 --> 00:47:14,616
are gonna find a way to save you.

934
00:47:14,616 --> 00:47:17,733
- My mom didn't wanna die in a hospital.

935
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:20,151
She begged my Dad to
take her out of there.

936
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:22,984
And he did, he took her to Joseph.

937
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:25,171
He helped her.

938
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,860
- But she died.

939
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:32,342
- Yeah, but she died in my Dad's arms

940
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:37,384
in the open air looking at the ocean.

941
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:41,171
- You are not going to die.

942
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:42,665
- Please William.

943
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:44,643
I'm asking you.

944
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:46,893
Please take me out of here!

945
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:52,476
- I can't.

946
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:57,553
I wanna help you.

947
00:47:58,518 --> 00:48:00,268
God, I wanna help you

948
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:03,291
but if I take you outta here,

949
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,874
I don't know what might happen.

950
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:08,915
- Okay.

951
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:14,017
Okay.

952
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,094
- I'm sorry.

953
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:17,927
- I know.

954
00:48:22,735 --> 00:48:24,493
I think I would've fallen in love with you

955
00:48:24,493 --> 00:48:28,348
even if all of this hadn't have happened.

956
00:48:28,348 --> 00:48:30,348
- Kathy, I know, I know.

957
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,528
I feel the same way.

958
00:48:35,752 --> 00:48:38,752
I mean, everything is just so crazy.

959
00:48:41,472 --> 00:48:43,480
But the first time I saw you...

960
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,994
- I know, I could see that you liked me.

961
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:50,827
It gave me goosebumps.

962
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:56,322
It's so weird.

963
00:48:58,494 --> 00:49:01,108
I wish that we could have more time.

964
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,583
- We will have more time.

965
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,300
You've gotta stop thinking like that.

966
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,157
You've gotta believe
everything is gonna be okay.

967
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:09,990
- I know.

968
00:49:11,302 --> 00:49:12,385
- Promise me.

969
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:17,262
Promise me that you
won't think about dying.

970
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:20,576
- Okay.

971
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:26,812
You know what I'd like?

972
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:28,229
- What? Anything.

973
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:30,189
- Ice cream.

974
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:33,618
- Ice cream?

975
00:49:33,618 --> 00:49:35,003
- Uh huh.

976
00:49:35,003 --> 00:49:37,747
- Okay, I'll go down and get you some.

977
00:49:37,747 --> 00:49:40,057
- No, no, I mean the good stuff

978
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,440
from the Freezalicious.

979
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,304
They make their own.

980
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:45,647
- Where is it?

981
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:48,166
- Just a couple blocks from here.

982
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:49,685
- What flavor?

983
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:50,768
- Strawberry.

984
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:52,477
- Alright.

985
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:56,140
- Just go out the front, take a left.

986
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,369
Two blocks.

987
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,700
- Freezalicious.

988
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,533
- Yeah.

989
00:50:00,591 --> 00:50:02,341
- I'll be right back.

990
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:34,764
- I just heard, anybody hurt?

991
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,515
- One in serious condition
with a spinal injury

992
00:50:36,515 --> 00:50:38,448
and broken ribs.

993
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:40,025
They don't have much in the
way of what we would call

994
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:40,893
a police department

995
00:50:40,893 --> 00:50:41,940
down there.
- How come?

996
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,107
- They don't have any crime until now.

997
00:50:46,012 --> 00:50:47,521
What do you think I should do?

998
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:49,242
I don't wanna pull the
team off the island but...

999
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:50,493
- If they're in danger.

1000
00:50:50,493 --> 00:50:51,326
- Exactly.

1001
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:54,585
I don't want them to be used as hostages.

1002
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:55,418
- Yeah.

1003
00:50:57,209 --> 00:50:59,841
- If we end up in a standoff, nobody wins.

1004
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:01,471
- It's your call.

1005
00:51:01,471 --> 00:51:02,304
- I know.

1006
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:06,443
I'm gonna pull them off the island.

1007
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:14,822
- Well, look who's here.

1008
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,114
- Hello Mr. Banes.

1009
00:51:17,114 --> 00:51:18,289
- Where to?

1010
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:20,039
- Hawk's Nest please.

1011
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:33,931
- Kathy?

1012
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:36,535
Kathy!

1013
00:51:48,562 --> 00:51:49,659
Kathy!

1014
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:52,084
- What's wrong with that kid?

1015
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:53,328
- Nothing.

1016
00:51:53,328 --> 00:51:54,578
Nothing at all.

1017
00:51:57,362 --> 00:51:58,908
- Want me to stop?

1018
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,325
- No, keep going.

1019
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,024
- Stop!

1020
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,631
- Not feeling well?

1021
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,137
- Smoking too much.

1022
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,400
All those people at the hospital,

1023
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,900
that lot of good it'll do 'em.

1024
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,000
- Shoot.

1025
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,007
- We're taking our team off the island.

1026
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:40,674
- You can't do that!

1027
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:42,120
- Just until things
cool down and then we'll

1028
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,886
send them back to you.

1029
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:45,201
- Excuse me but when do you
think that's gonna happen,

1030
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:47,202
after we're all dead?

1031
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:48,725
- I know what this sounds like Linda,

1032
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:50,334
but we're not abandoning you.

1033
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,070
- Fine, what do we do in the meantime?

1034
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,068
- Keep working.

1035
00:52:54,068 --> 00:52:55,388
Our team is gonna be onboard ship.

1036
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:57,199
You can easily transmit your data to them.

1037
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,442
- They will not have the
facilities to make use

1038
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:00,775
of our findings.

1039
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,379
Who is gonna help me here?

1040
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:07,271
The people at this hospital
are not research scientists.

1041
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,602
- I'm sorry.

1042
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,345
This is a bump in the road for all of us.

1043
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:13,040
- Ugh, that's a bit of an understatement.

1044
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,402
- Look, as soon as I can
pull together a security team

1045
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:17,469
that is fully equipped
with protective gear

1046
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:18,817
so they're safe from the virus.

1047
00:53:18,817 --> 00:53:21,487
- How long will that take?

1048
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:22,737
- I don't know.

1049
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:25,605
You have to know that we're
doing everything we can

1050
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:26,869
to make this work.

1051
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,409
Please don't give up on us.

1052
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,783
We're not giving up on you.

1053
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:33,514
- Ya know, you owe me a vacation.

1054
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:35,931
- I will pay for that myself.

1055
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:39,743
- Yes, I'd like a margarita please.

1056
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:41,643
And could you move that umbrella a little?

1057
00:53:41,643 --> 00:53:43,476
It's blocking the sun.

1058
00:53:46,642 --> 00:53:49,392
- Kathy, she's left the hospital.

1059
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:54,027
- I think I know where she's gone, hop in.

of your mother.

1075
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,384
I've seen her here many times

1076
00:56:13,384 --> 00:56:16,148
enjoying the ocean breeze and clear skies.

1077
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:16,981
- Really?

1078
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:19,510
- I feel her presence even now

1079
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,291
watching over you.

1080
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,725
- Maybe I'll be with her soon.

1081
00:56:23,725 --> 00:56:24,558
- Maybe.

1082
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,759
- I wish I wasn't so afraid.

1083
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,356
- Try it.

1084
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,622
It's like walking through a door.

1085
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:36,164
You leave behind one family

1086
00:56:36,164 --> 00:56:38,334
and we join another.

1087
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:40,167
- How can you be sure?

1088
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:44,180
- I've seen the other side.

1089
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,274
I know how it sounds, believe me.

1090
00:56:47,274 --> 00:56:52,161
Never less, I was given a
look into what lies ahead.

1091
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:54,161
There's nothing to fear.

1092
00:56:56,573 --> 00:56:59,573
Does your father know where you are?

1093
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:01,319
- No.

1094
00:57:03,668 --> 00:57:07,251
I wish he were here so
I could say goodbye.

1095
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:12,182
- A wish can be a prayer sometimes.

1096
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:16,349
The praying that comes from
the heart is often answered.

1097
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,494
It is a beautiful day to be alive.

1098
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:22,827
Don't you think?

1099
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:24,626
- Yes.

1100
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:32,081
- Kathy.

1101
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,065
Kathy, what have you done?

1102
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:36,507
- It's alright Dad.

1103
00:57:36,507 --> 00:57:37,906
Everything is okay.

1104
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:39,925
- It's my fault, I shouldn't
have left you alone.

1105
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:41,894
- No, no, it's not a bad thing honest.

1106
00:57:41,894 --> 00:57:46,459
- Listen, we have to get
you back to the hospital.

1107
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:48,060
- Yes Paul?

1108
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,893
- You're...

1109
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:50,803
- I'm well.

1110
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:52,818
- Yeah.

1111
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:57,676
- If you don't get
those temporary shelters

1112
00:57:57,676 --> 00:57:58,534
before tonight...

1113
00:57:58,534 --> 00:57:59,560
- No, don't worry.

1114
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,393
They'll be here.

1115
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,672
In the meantime, I think we ought to move

1116
00:58:01,672 --> 00:58:04,040
the ambulatory patients
into the garden area,

1117
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,308
keep them hydrated until
the shelters are up.

1118
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:08,503
That'll free up about a dozen beds.

1119
00:58:08,503 --> 00:58:09,954
- Hey you.

1120
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:10,914
I wanna see a doctor.

1121
00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:11,847
- Of course.

1122
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:13,203
If you'll just have a seat
over there with the others,

1123
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:14,420
someone will give you a form.

1124
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,395
- I wanna see somebody now!

1125
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:17,978
- Mr. Banes, is it?

1126
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:20,907
- Yeah, that's right.

1127
00:58:20,907 --> 00:58:22,800
- If you don't sit down,
I'm gonna have you put

1128
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,967
in restraints.

1129
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:29,061
- You people are all alike.

1130
00:58:29,061 --> 00:58:33,570
Put on a white coat and
you think you're God.

1131
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:37,337
- We'll be with you as soon as we can.

1132
00:58:37,337 --> 00:58:40,435
- We didn't have this
problem 'til you showed up.

1133
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:42,127
Anybody notice that?

1134
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:45,307
- Look, we'll get to
everybody as soon as possible.

1135
00:58:45,307 --> 00:58:47,640
Thank you for your patience.

1136
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,237
- We're getting more people
like him all the time.

1137
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,953
They're angry because they
can't get off the island

1138
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:54,164
and they're blaming us.

1139
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,149
- I know.

1140
00:58:55,149 --> 00:58:57,707
Fear spreads faster than a virus.

1141
00:59:01,346 --> 00:59:02,179
Yes?

1142
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:06,402
Paul, what is it, what's wrong?

1143
00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:07,485
Are you sure?

1144
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:09,961
Where are you?

1145
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:40,690
- Have you noticed the way
your dad looks at my mom?

1146
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,046
- I know.

1147
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,046
They look good together.

1148
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:05,024
- Look at him, he's obviously better.

1149
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:07,083
- You say it as if it was something that

1150
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,166
could not be.

1151
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:11,155
- It's amazing.

1152
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,504
May I?

1153
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:18,096
- If you must.

1154
01:00:30,186 --> 01:00:31,958
- Have you taken something?

1155
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,508
Medicine, something you made from herbs?

1156
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:36,613
- I have taken only what God has given me.

1157
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:38,076
- No please don't do that.

1158
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:41,609
I need to know exactly what
you've done to get well.

1159
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:43,143
- I believe, woman.

1160
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:45,634
That is what I have done.

1161
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:47,872
Go thou and do likewise.

1162
01:00:47,872 --> 01:00:50,168
- Joseph, your blood will
have antibodies to the virus.

1163
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:54,001
We can make a serum from
it and heal everyone.

1164
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,900
- When are you going to believe me?

1165
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,028
What you are looking for
is in the air around you.

1166
01:00:59,028 --> 01:01:00,679
It is in every living thing.

1167
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:01,950
When you open yourself to God,

1168
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,081
you'll find all the answers you need.

1169
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,470
- I understand that.

1170
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:08,800
I am opening myself to
what is here right now

1171
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,602
and what I see is that
God may have put you here

1172
01:01:11,602 --> 01:01:15,806
to save the lives of
everybody on this island.

1173
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:18,301
- You learn quickly.

1174
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:20,031
Your words flow like honey

1175
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:23,316
but they come from here instead of here.

1176
01:01:23,316 --> 01:01:26,298
- Look, this is not about who's right

1177
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:28,059
or who's wrong or how we should live.

1178
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,575
This is about life and death!

1179
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:34,931
Paul's daughter is gonna
die if you don't help us.

1180
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:37,535
Will it help for me to
say that you're right?

1181
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:39,592
That you have been able
to find what has eluded

1182
01:01:39,592 --> 01:01:40,538
the rest of us?

1183
01:01:40,538 --> 01:01:41,371
Okay!

1184
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,744
You're right.

1185
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,161
We should be more like you,

1186
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,784
but right now, there
is not time to change.

1187
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:50,527
- Can still reach out and find the way.

1188
01:01:50,527 --> 01:01:51,360
- Joseph!

1189
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,420
- Joseph, I tried.

1190
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,341
Don't you think I've prayed every moment?

1191
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:57,566
I can't find that place.

1192
01:01:57,566 --> 01:01:59,363
I can't find that calm in
the midst of all this chaos

1193
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:02,446
to listen to what God has to tell me.

1194
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:06,826
But that's why there's people like you

1195
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:09,909
so that people like me can be helped.

1196
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:14,300
So that we can hear
what God has to tell us.

1197
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,697
So you talk to him for me.

1198
01:02:16,697 --> 01:02:18,228
You tell him a father will
do anything to save his

1199
01:02:18,228 --> 01:02:19,228
little girl.

1200
01:02:20,614 --> 01:02:23,864
You tell him that I would give my life.

1201
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:28,375
You tell him please.

1202
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,168
- Take what you need.

1203
01:02:36,204 --> 01:02:37,204
- Thank you.

1204
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:40,912
- Thank you.

1205
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:46,662
- We're right behind you Will.

1206
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:47,495
Be careful.

1207
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:48,328
- Yes sir.

1208
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:49,161
- I love you Daddy.

1209
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:49,994
- I love you too honey.

1210
01:02:49,994 --> 01:02:51,144
We're gonna get you better.

1211
01:02:51,144 --> 01:02:52,559
You hang in there, promise?

1212
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,392
- Promise.

1213
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:11,355
- You know, when I picked
this island for a vacation,

1214
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:14,938
I was told absolutely
nothing happens here.

1215
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,960
No traffic, no crime,

1216
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:23,977
nothing but sunshine, peace and quiet.

1217
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:28,448
- Considering the circumstances,
do you really believe

1218
01:03:28,448 --> 01:03:31,533
it was your choice to come to this island?

1219
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,607
Linda?

1220
01:03:58,173 --> 01:03:59,682
- Lady, I need to see a doctor.

1221
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:00,918
- This is a restricted area.

1222
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:02,389
I need you to leave immediately.

1223
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:04,226
- I want treatment!

1224
01:04:04,226 --> 01:04:07,148
- Can somebody take care of this man?

1225
01:04:07,148 --> 01:04:08,537
Dalia.

1226
01:04:08,537 --> 01:04:10,629
Dr. Flemming, where are you?

1227
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:11,547
He's not here.

1228
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,950
He's taken his team to the airport.

1229
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,040
We had an incident.

1230
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,158
Two men tried to take Dr. Nevison hostage.

1231
01:04:17,158 --> 01:04:20,649
He was wounded, they're being evacuated.

1232
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,061
I'm told they won't be
allowed to come back

1233
01:04:22,061 --> 01:04:24,117
to the island until the
military can secure it.

1234
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:25,926
- How long will that be?

1235
01:04:25,926 --> 01:04:26,840
A week?

1236
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,853
No, that's not possible.

1237
01:04:27,853 --> 01:04:29,473
They've gotta come back.

1238
01:04:29,473 --> 01:04:30,455
Look, I may have a cure.

1239
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:31,746
I just found somebody who had the virus

1240
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:33,118
and he recovered.

1241
01:04:33,118 --> 01:04:35,335
Yes! I just took his blood.

1242
01:04:35,335 --> 01:04:37,795
Now you've gotta stop Nevison
and his team from leaving.

1243
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:40,333
- I'll do what I can.

1244
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,935
What?

1245
01:04:41,935 --> 01:04:44,181
- They're evacuating the CDC team.

1246
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,098
- Lord, no.

1247
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:49,483
- Yes, to whom am I speaking?

1248
01:04:49,483 --> 01:04:51,754
Miss Ellen, this is Dr.
Dalia from the hospital.

1249
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:53,279
There are a group of people from the

1250
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:55,346
Center for Disease Control
on their way there.

1251
01:04:55,346 --> 01:04:57,550
You must have them...

1252
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,883
Yes, yes, please put him on.

1253
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:01,885
- Nevison.

1254
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,923
Are you sure?

1255
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:07,919
Look, my people aren't safe here.

1256
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:09,231
We're under orders to leave.

1257
01:05:09,231 --> 01:05:10,296
- But you don't understand!

1258
01:05:10,296 --> 01:05:12,379
She has a potential cure!

1259
01:05:13,274 --> 01:05:15,556
She's bringing the blood in now.

1260
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:16,389
They're only at Hawk's Nest.

1261
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:18,306
That's 45 minutes away.

1262
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:23,453
If you leave now, we may
not be here by the time

1263
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:24,893
you get back.

1264
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,727
- Will?

1265
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:43,560
Oh no.

1266
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:45,932
Are you alright?

1267
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:47,987
- I'm fine.

1268
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:50,074
Fine.

1269
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:17,787
- Banes.

1270
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:19,132
Excuse me.

1271
01:06:19,132 --> 01:06:20,349
- We've got an emergency man.

1272
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:22,349
You gotta move your car.

1273
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:24,877
- I want that cure.

1274
01:06:24,877 --> 01:06:25,926
- Whoa, whoa.

1275
01:06:25,926 --> 01:06:27,007
- Where is it?

1276
01:06:27,007 --> 01:06:28,090
- God, he's insane!

1277
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,917
- Take it easy.

1278
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,593
Wait a minute.

1279
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:32,435
What are you doing?

1280
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:33,518
- You try it.

1281
01:06:35,189 --> 01:06:36,881
- You can't have that!

1282
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,517
No! No!

1283
01:06:38,517 --> 01:06:39,850
- Don't do this.

1284
01:06:43,509 --> 01:06:47,129
Listen, you don't know what you're doing.

1285
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,935
- I know what I'm doing.

1286
01:06:48,935 --> 01:06:49,768
Move.

1287
01:06:50,975 --> 01:06:52,351
- We need that to make a serum.

1288
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:53,812
You can't just inject it.

1289
01:06:53,812 --> 01:06:54,729
- Back off.

1290
01:06:58,594 --> 01:06:59,927
- Don't do this.

1291
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:02,709
Banes, come on.

1292
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:08,761
We may be able to help you.

1293
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:11,845
- I'm through waiting in line.

1294
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:14,678
- People could die because of you.

1295
01:07:15,912 --> 01:07:17,412
- Don't follow me.

1296
01:07:38,044 --> 01:07:38,877
- Banes!

1297
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:45,617
- Wait Paul, don't touch him.

1298
01:07:45,617 --> 01:07:46,450
Use this.

1299
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:51,447
- He's dead.

1300
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:52,614
- Get the bag.

1301
01:07:55,998 --> 01:07:59,408
We have to get this blood
treated right away, let's go.

1302
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:01,888
- Is she okay?

1303
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:02,940
- Everything's fine.

1304
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:03,773
- Where's my mother?

1305
01:08:03,773 --> 01:08:04,606
I have to talk to her.

1306
01:08:04,606 --> 01:08:06,599
- Relax, she'll be here soon.

1307
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:08,653
- I can't see anything.

1308
01:08:08,653 --> 01:08:10,795
What's happening?

1309
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,122
- Everything's alright.

1310
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:13,068
- Will?

1311
01:08:13,068 --> 01:08:14,354
- I'm right beside you.

1312
01:08:14,354 --> 01:08:15,903
- Don't leave me, okay?

1313
01:08:15,903 --> 01:08:16,736
- Never.

1314
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:20,013
- It's me, we have a problem.

1315
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,368
The car broke down.

1316
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,480
What? I can't hear you.

1317
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,970
You're breaking up.

1318
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,343
- There's a car.
- What?

1319
01:08:26,343 --> 01:08:28,217
- Alright, we'll be there soon as we can.

1320
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:29,261
Stop!

1321
01:08:29,261 --> 01:08:30,428
- Stop!
- Stop!

1322
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,367
- Has everybody gone crazy?

1323
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:37,284
- The virus, they're all terrified.

1324
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:43,162
Oh my God, they're leaving.

1325
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,038
- How can they leave?

1326
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:45,538
We have the blood.

1327
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:49,385
- Look!

1328
01:08:51,514 --> 01:08:53,014
- Hey, stop, stop!

1329
01:08:54,074 --> 01:08:55,690
- Here, take this.

1330
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:57,190
Stop, please stop!

1331
01:08:58,065 --> 01:08:59,541
We need help!
- Linda!

1332
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:00,791
- Stop the car!

1333
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:02,792
What's your problem?

1334
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:04,681
- Hey, we gotta get to the hospital, okay?

1335
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:06,264
Thanks.
- Thank you!

1336
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:10,772
- Go, go!
- Go!

1337
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:32,406
- I can't do anything without the CDC.

1338
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:33,273
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

1339
01:09:33,273 --> 01:09:34,637
Maybe we can do this by ourselves.

1340
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:35,670
- I can't even walk.

1341
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,726
I can't keep my eyes open.

1342
01:09:36,726 --> 01:09:37,979
- You gotta keep going.

1343
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,191
My daughters life depends on it.

1344
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:41,375
- Dr. Flemming, they're coming back.

1345
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,658
The CDC just called, I
told them about the blood

1346
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:45,613
and they're coming back.

1347
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,586
- They turned back.

1348
01:09:53,586 --> 01:09:54,419
- Who?

1349
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:56,127
- Our team, they were on
route to the USS Madison

1350
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,799
and then they turned around and went back.

1351
01:09:58,799 --> 01:10:00,034
- Nevison.

1352
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:00,867
- Yeah.

1353
01:10:02,514 --> 01:10:03,684
- You know what?

1354
01:10:03,684 --> 01:10:05,252
Call the President's office.

1355
01:10:05,252 --> 01:10:06,537
I want him to know that
in the middle of nowhere

1356
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:08,653
on an island hardly anybody's heard about,

1357
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:10,735
there are Americans helping other people

1358
01:10:10,735 --> 01:10:13,735
that are disobeying orders to do it.

1359
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,322
You know what, no matter
what anybody says,

1360
01:10:16,322 --> 01:10:20,943
when the stuff hits the
fan, we're always there.

1361
01:10:20,943 --> 01:10:22,050
Tell him that.

1362
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,860
Be happy to.

1363
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,529
- Tell him I want a year off.

1364
01:10:25,529 --> 01:10:26,779
Got it.

1365
01:10:32,544 --> 01:10:33,377
- Mom.

1366
01:10:34,638 --> 01:10:36,055
- I'm right here.

1367
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,123
- Has this been fun or what?

1368
01:10:41,588 --> 01:10:42,671
- I love you.

1369
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:48,147
- Can you save her?

1370
01:10:55,674 --> 01:10:56,757
- Absolutely.

1371
01:10:57,977 --> 01:10:58,810
- Truth.

1372
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:04,268
- I don't know.

1373
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:18,717
Dr. Flemming, Dr. Flemming,

1374
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:20,800
you're needed in the lab.

1375
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:29,626
- Wow, you look as bad as I feel.

1376
01:11:29,626 --> 01:11:31,190
- Thanks.

1377
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:33,491
Actually I was just about
to go play some tennis

1378
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:35,408
and then get a massage.

1379
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:38,592
What can I do for you?

1380
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:40,821
- Okay, I won't keep ya then.

1381
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:42,836
How's your son doing?

1382
01:11:42,836 --> 01:11:44,565
- He's holding his own.

1383
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:46,069
- We're praying for him, Linda.

1384
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:48,190
We're praying for everybody there.

1385
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,026
Can you give me an
approximate ETA on the serum.

1386
01:11:51,026 --> 01:11:52,999
- Well, we just were
able to hook up with your

1387
01:11:52,999 --> 01:11:55,974
main computer, so that
should give us a leg up.

1388
01:11:55,974 --> 01:11:59,022
Once we're in the same
ball park, so to speak,

1389
01:11:59,022 --> 01:12:01,741
we should be able to
make some real progress.

1390
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:03,890
- Good, that sounds promising.

1391
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:05,951
- Yeah, it is if you have
a few weeks to work with.

1392
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:07,105
We don't.

1393
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:09,147
Here's the problem.

1394
01:12:09,147 --> 01:12:11,366
We've been able to track
the progression of the virus

1395
01:12:11,366 --> 01:12:14,989
on a typical patient and
it's become very clear to us

1396
01:12:14,989 --> 01:12:17,045
that if we don't come up
with a serum in the next

1397
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:20,429
24 hours, we're gonna
lose just about everybody

1398
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:23,012
we have here, including my son.

1399
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:29,644
- I see.

1400
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,513
So, we've got 24 hours.

1401
01:12:33,371 --> 01:12:35,509
We have til six PM tomorrow.

1402
01:12:35,509 --> 01:12:36,827
- Yeah.

1403
01:12:36,827 --> 01:12:38,760
- Okay, I really won't keep you then.

1404
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,201
Everybody here is praying for you.

1405
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:45,175
- We need all the prayers we can get.

1406
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:59,652
- No, I told you before,
we tried that already.

1407
01:12:59,652 --> 01:13:01,209
It doesn't work.

1408
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,085
Look, it's right there on your data sheet.

1409
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:05,516
Pay attention for God's sake.

1410
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:06,625
You're wasting time.

1411
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:07,607
- Hey.

1412
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:08,641
- They've gotta work together.

1413
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:10,071
We are duplicating
- I know.

1414
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:10,904
- failed procedures.

1415
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:12,587
- We're all dragging right
now, we need our second wind.

1416
01:13:12,587 --> 01:13:13,922
You need to take a break.

1417
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,562
Just close your eyes for a minute.

1418
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:16,395
- Forget it.

1419
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:18,336
- John, I'll wake you in 15.

1420
01:13:18,336 --> 01:13:19,335
Go on!

1421
01:13:19,335 --> 01:13:21,835
You're no good to us this way.

1422
01:13:47,739 --> 01:13:49,572
Sir, coffee.

1423
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:04,798
- Daddy?

1424
01:14:04,798 --> 01:14:06,270
- Yeah honey?

1425
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,479
- I love you.

1426
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:08,988
- I love you too

1427
01:14:08,988 --> 01:14:10,541
more than anything.

1428
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:11,458
- And Will.

1429
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,820
What about Will?

1430
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,820
- He's here.

1431
01:14:17,532 --> 01:14:19,691
He needs you to keep going.

1432
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:21,192
- He does?

1433
01:14:21,192 --> 01:14:23,464
- Yeah, yeah listen Kathy,

1434
01:14:23,464 --> 01:14:27,455
he told me he can't make it without ya.

1435
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:30,681
He said he needs you to get better.

1436
01:14:30,681 --> 01:14:31,931
Do you hear me?

1437
01:14:34,378 --> 01:14:36,779
Don't let him down.

1438
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:37,612
- Okay.

1439
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:57,168
- John!

1440
01:14:58,627 --> 01:14:59,460
John!

1441
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:06,976
Take a look.

1442
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:16,719
- I think you've turned a corner for us.

1443
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,274
Print it out.

1444
01:15:18,274 --> 01:15:19,357
- You got it.

1445
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:34,360
- Linda, Linda?

1446
01:15:37,005 --> 01:15:37,838
Linda.

1447
01:15:39,811 --> 01:15:42,419
You were giving me a progress report.

1448
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:43,880
- Where was I?

1449
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,119
- You're making progress.

1450
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:47,964
- We're close.

1451
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:48,964
- How close?

1452
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,353
- This close.

1453
01:15:54,497 --> 01:15:56,091
- How you holding up?

1454
01:15:56,091 --> 01:15:58,116
- Just signed up for an aerobics class.

1455
01:15:58,116 --> 01:15:59,592
You wanna join me?

1456
01:15:59,592 --> 01:16:01,092
- Yes, absolutely.

1457
01:16:01,968 --> 01:16:03,367
Linda?

1458
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:04,789
- Yeah?

1459
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:05,951
- Thank you.

1460
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:06,868
- For what?

1461
01:16:08,038 --> 01:16:10,371
- For absolutely everything.

1462
01:16:11,258 --> 01:16:12,724
- We're not there yet.

1463
01:16:12,724 --> 01:16:14,310
- No, I know but...

1464
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:15,615
- Hey.

1465
01:16:15,615 --> 01:16:16,448
- Yeah?

1466
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:18,503
- Your people,

1467
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:21,658
they did good.

1468
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:23,113
- I'll talk to you soon.

1469
01:16:23,113 --> 01:16:23,946
- Yeah.

1470
01:16:27,232 --> 01:16:28,425
- Another hour.

1471
01:16:28,425 --> 01:16:29,258
- Yeah.

1472
01:16:30,094 --> 01:16:31,765
We're cutting it really close.

1473
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:10,990
- Garden area.

1474
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:20,842
Fast as you can.

1475
01:17:21,936 --> 01:17:22,769
- 16.

1476
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,018
- Thank you.

1477
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:53,115
We're all done baby.

1478
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:57,547
Okay, we're all done.

1479
01:18:57,547 --> 01:18:59,130
- I love you honey.

1480
01:19:31,122 --> 01:19:31,955
- Oh God.

1481
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:38,520
Thank you God, thank you God.

1482
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:48,471
It's
four AM here in Basarato,

1483
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:51,159
the scene of round-the-clock
celebrations today

1484
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:53,160
as the islanders give
thanks for their deliverance

1485
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,979
from the epidemic that
threatened to wipe them out.

1486
01:20:05,914 --> 01:20:07,081
- Well, hello.

1487
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:10,490
- Oh hello.
- You guys.

1488
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:12,009
- Have fun!

1489
01:20:12,009 --> 01:20:13,342
- Okay, you too.

1490
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:16,207
They look good together.

1491
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:17,995
- They sure do.

1492
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:19,827
I have to tell ya, when we first got here,

1493
01:20:19,827 --> 01:20:21,290
I was a little concerned.

1494
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:22,954
I mean, they just took
one look at each other...

1495
01:20:22,954 --> 01:20:25,754
- Oh I know, bang, they were gone.

1496
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:28,606
Guess it happens like
that when you're young.

1497
01:20:28,606 --> 01:20:29,881
- Yeah!

1498
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:31,882
Remember how that felt?

1499
01:20:31,882 --> 01:20:32,882
- Yeah I do.

1500
01:20:35,866 --> 01:20:37,696
- I hope it works out for them.

1501
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:39,177
They deserve something wonderful after

1502
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:40,296
everything that's happened.

1503
01:20:40,296 --> 01:20:41,627
- Well, there's always the
risk that it won't but,

1504
01:20:41,627 --> 01:20:44,705
hey, I think it's worth it, don't you?

1505
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:45,538
- Yeah.

1506
01:20:46,519 --> 01:20:48,086
I do wonder though,

1507
01:20:48,086 --> 01:20:50,750
maybe it was the
extraordinary circumstances,

1508
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:54,949
all the drama, what happened
that led them to this point.

1509
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:56,680
That wears off after a while.

1510
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,513
- Sometimes I think it takes something

1511
01:20:58,513 --> 01:21:02,221
like what we've been through
to make those emotions flower

1512
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:04,879
and even though circumstances may change,

1513
01:21:04,879 --> 01:21:09,475
the feeling that's inside of
both of them won't go away.

1514
01:21:09,475 --> 01:21:10,590
Right?

1515
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:11,673
- I hope not.

1516
01:21:13,177 --> 01:21:15,235
I would like to see them happy

1517
01:21:15,235 --> 01:21:18,473
and in love for the rest of their lives.

1518
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:19,306
You?

1519
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:21,988
- More than anything.

1520
01:21:23,673 --> 01:21:25,510
- Come on you two!

1521
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,715
Let's join the party!

1522
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,232
- Oh, we'll be there!

1523
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:29,277
Save us some fun!

1524
01:21:29,277 --> 01:21:30,110
- Okay!

1525
01:21:41,883 --> 01:21:42,983
- So when do you go back?

1526
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:45,344
- Oh, I've got a ton of
follow up on this virus.

1527
01:21:45,344 --> 01:21:48,470
CDC wants a complete
analysis of our methodology

1528
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:51,211
and I have to do a breakdown
on the different stages

1529
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:52,567
of infection.

1530
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:54,397
- Sounds like a lot of work to me.

1531
01:21:54,397 --> 01:21:56,138
- Two months at least.

1532
01:21:56,138 --> 01:21:57,915
- Really? That long?

1533
01:21:57,915 --> 01:21:59,651
What about your job?

1534
01:21:59,651 --> 01:22:01,820
- I'm gonna take a leave of absence.

1535
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,603
This is too important.

1536
01:22:03,603 --> 01:22:05,176
- Two months.

1537
01:22:05,176 --> 01:22:07,270
- Yeah, at least.

1538
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,735
But, this is an ideal location

1539
01:22:09,735 --> 01:22:12,065
for studying viruses.

1540
01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:15,713
- Sounds more like three months to me.

1541
01:22:15,713 --> 01:22:17,213
- Maybe even more.

1542
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:27,441
- And where have you been?

1543
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:28,761
- Enjoying myself.

1544
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:30,748
You should try it sometime.

1545
01:22:30,748 --> 01:22:31,947
- I was.

1546
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,473
- Let your laughter be
a blessing to others.

1547
01:22:34,473 --> 01:22:37,054
- I never really have thanked you yet

1548
01:22:37,054 --> 01:22:38,558
for what you did.

1549
01:22:38,558 --> 01:22:40,673
- Me? I did nothing.

1550
01:22:40,673 --> 01:22:43,059
- You saved the lives of our children.

1551
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:46,359
- It is flattering to see
thanks for God's work.

1552
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:48,488
Come, I want you to dance with me

1553
01:22:48,488 --> 01:22:49,321
- Oh.

1554
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:51,438
- Show the Lord we are truly happy

1555
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:52,876
with all that he gives us.

1556
01:22:52,876 --> 01:22:54,312
- I really am not a good dancer.

1557
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:55,208
I can't.

1558
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:56,414
- Sure you can!

1559
01:22:56,414 --> 01:22:58,136
Come on Paul, show your
woman what it's like

1560
01:22:58,136 --> 01:22:59,324
to be an islander.

1561
01:22:59,324 --> 01:23:01,336
- I think I already have.
