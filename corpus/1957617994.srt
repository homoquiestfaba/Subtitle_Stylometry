00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,352
I got gas, fool.

47
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:30,677

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,658

68
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:36,177
A lot of you students have
been struggling with this class

69
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:40,725
while for others, this
course has been a breeze.

70
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,912
This'll be the last
examination of the semester

71
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:45,834
and for a few of you students,

72
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:49,610
everything depends upon this one grade.

73
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,504
It'll also affect being eligible

74
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,906

80
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,333
Now, I've decided to pair people up

81
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,896
to see how two heads
collaborate on one idea.

82
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:15,144
When I call out these names,

83
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:17,664
the decision is final.

84
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,581
By no means

85
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,944
will any changes be made.

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,693
The first pair will be Kendal and Bill.

87
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:29,377

93
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:52,960
- My name is Kendal, check me out.

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,003
I'm going to be one of
the Raiders one day, okay?

95
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:54,836
- Kendal.

96
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:55,794
- I'll talk to you later.

97
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:56,736

I can't believe I'm downtown
with this geeky brother.

101
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,443
- Man, you are so self-centered.

102
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:08,596
You can do all the bickering in the world

103
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,538
but the facts still remain.

104
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,757
We have a report due analyzing

105
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:15,232
and the paper's due too soon.

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,543
Now, your only job is to pick
out the interesting people.

107
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:21,856
I'll record our observations
on my pocket recorder.

108
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,606
We'll call our report

110
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,665
- No shit, Sherlock.

111
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,332
- So keep searching.

112
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,520
- Okay, since I don't know anyone

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,005
in this town, let's clown.

114
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:34,838
- What?

115
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:36,192
- Let's make it interesting.

116
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,069
Why don't we do a paper
where we take a secret look

117
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,437
at people and their actions.

118
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:43,989
We can make our own analysis
from the people we observe.

119
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,130
- Hey, wait, wait.

120
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,963
Kendal,

121
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,746
I love it, man.

122
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,549
I mean, I've always wanted
to do something like that.

123
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,049
- You're on, baby!

124
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:53,889
(Kendal chuckles)

125
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:54,986
- Good afternoon,

126
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,333
especially to any students and staff.

127
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,370
You are about to enter a world

128
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,973
where you can take a shot at dreams

129
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:06,056
and yet still be shocked
right back into reality.

130
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,765
(slow music plays)

131
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:13,546
- Man, it's almost show time.

132
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,754
I gotta make me enough money
to see Eddie Murphy next week.

133
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:17,258
Hey people, what's up?

134

Don't miss out, I'm Happnens!

137
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,928
so I can, you already know,
see Eddie Murphy next week.

138
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:27,421
You know, they got a show
coming up down at the Paramount.

139
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,725
Now,

140
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,346
I used to mess around with
a whole bunch of fat women.

141
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,073
You know what I'm saying?

142
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:33,834
I'm pulling back the layers and shit

143
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,149

and Skittles everywhere.

144
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:36,982
(crowd chuckles)

145
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,783
So, we got a 100 black
men and one white man.

146
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:39,637
- Hey, wait.

147
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:41,289
- [Performer] What do
you call the white man?

148
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,122
- Let me check this out.

149
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:42,955
- [Performer] Warden, okay.

154
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:48,459

You know what I'm saying?

158
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,696
I had another fat chick, right--

159
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,634
- [Woman] Robert, I'm with you,

160
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,744
but please don't blow this opportunity.

161
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:58,549
- Baby fried up a whole
mound of fried chicken.

162
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,170
I got up to the house and, you know,

163
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,496
I'm trying to be delicate
because Happening

164
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,329
got a little bit of manners.

165
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,162
You know, my Mama taught me how to eat

166
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,162
over at somebody house.

167
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,146
I'll pick up a piece of
chicken and put it on my plate

168
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,596

170
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:11,424
Man, I finish my little piece of chicken.

171
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,877
All I seen was a mound of
chicken bones on the stove.

172
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,189
You know what I'm saying?

173
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,022

Let me tell ya', baby

You know what I'm feeling?

176
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,754
I only got one little wing.

177
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,336
She got 83 whole chickens, I'm like, "Oh."

178
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:23,700
Knowing I can't eat here,

179
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,234
you know, I'll be done starved to death.

180
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:28,067
Shit!

181
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:28,900
Hey, man.

182
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,733
I'm Happnens.

183
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,566
I appreciate all your support.

184
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,399
Come see me again--

185
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,232
- He sounded pretty good.

186
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:33,065
- Because, I'm usually down here.

187
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:33,898
- You know, I see some
opportunity in this.

188
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:34,731
- I appreciate it, I thank you very much.

189
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,564
Thank you.

190
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,397
Hey, put my coins down!

191
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,230
All right, thank you.

192
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,165
I appreciate that.

193
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:39,998
- Yo'.

194
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,248
- Yo', Happening dude,
you hella funny man.

195
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,008
- Right on, man, I appreciate that.

196
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,425
- Man, my name's Robbie Simms.

197
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,984
I promote Tommy Ho.

198
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:46,817
- Oh, right on!

199
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,650
- Hey, here's my card.

200
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,053
- [Happening] Oh man!

201
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,109
Right on!

202
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:54,005
Where's the spot?

203
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,488
- Hey, Vintage Inn.

204
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,279
Eight p.m. sharp.

205
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,112
- [Happening] I know where that's at.

206
00:06:58,112 --> 00:06:59,187
That's a pretty hip club.

207
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:00,020
- Yeah, it is.

208
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,853
- [Happening] I'll be there.

209
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:01,877
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

210
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:02,710
- Yeah, tonight.

211
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,530
I know for a fact you ready,
so I'm gonna see you there.

212
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,472
Eight p.m..

213
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:06,677
- [Happening] Man, don't
even trip, I'll be there.

214
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,117
Eight o'clock at the big V.I..

215
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:09,301
- Yeah, that's right.

216
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,613
You make sure, you know, you
clean up your act a little bit.

217
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,927
You know, straighten up the
coat and everything else.

218
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:13,760
You know?

219
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,593
- Don't every body that.

220
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:16,051
I got some tissues I got from lunch!

221
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,760
Right through this lobby
right here, cut through there.

222
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,199
There's a little bathroom and shit.

223
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,032
- [Robbie] Yeah!

224
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:23,365
- I'll go and I'll do that
and wash up and be clean.

225
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,532
I'll be clean!

226
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,323
This is my chance.

227
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:41,363
- You got me sweating like a nigga going

228
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:42,880
to the election in Georgia!

229
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,298
(crowd laughs)

230
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,914
He choose the fucking
guy to yank on the stick.

231
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:48,747
- No!

232
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,529
- And pull a dirty stick right, y'all,

233
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,338
out of the crack of his ass!

234
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:56,370
I ain't got nothing else
to say to my homeboy.

235
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,034
Don't ever sweat me on the
motherfucking tip no more, nigga.

236
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:01,928
You know what I'm saying?

237
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,789
Because, I walk on water, I eat bullets

238
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:07,262
and I shit ice cream, homeboy!

239
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,618
Are you understanding?

240
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:12,082
And fuck this shit, but I'm
going to be just as righteous

241
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:14,069
because it ain't gonna be no big deal.

242
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,946
- Pam, so what sort of act do you do?

243
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:19,552
- I have a, it's a
pretty adult, comedy act.

244
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:20,864
- Okay, well, we'll talk in the future

245
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,506
about you doing something on the show.

246
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:23,722
- Oh great, that would be fine.

247
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:24,778
- Okay, I'll talk to you later on.

248
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:25,768
- Okay.

249
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:26,601
- It was nice meeting you.

250
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:27,520
- Nice meeting you too.

251
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,353
- [Club Man] Okay.

252
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:31,328
- You don't, you look--

253
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,405
- Todd, how are you doing?

254
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,589
I'm glad you could make it.

255
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:34,422
- Real good.

256
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:35,255
- Are you enjoying the show?

257
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,088
Oh, I'm fine.

258
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:36,921
Are you enjoying the show or what?

259
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,838
Oh great, great, great.

260
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:40,757
- I ain't playing.

261
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,474
- Boy, you better stop worrying!

262
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,064
We're already in here.

263
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,280
It only takes 10 minutes from--

264
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,195
- I felt--

265
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:49,862
- Maybe six and a half,
but maybe happening?

266
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:53,022
- Look, I put my business on the line,

267
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:56,059
my name on the line, my body
on the line for this dork!

268
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:56,892
- [Club Man] James, how are you doing?

269
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,563
Glad you could make it.

270
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,201
Are you enjoying the show thus far?

271
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:01,034
- Stop worrying!

272
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:01,867
- [James] Oh yeah!

273
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:02,700
- Oh, awesome.

274
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,977
Great, I'll talk to you after the show.

275
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,937
- [James] Okay.

276
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:05,770
- Okay.

277
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,611
Robert.

278
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:07,444
- Yeah?

279
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:08,673
- Man, you got 10 more minutes

280
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,506
before your act goes on, all right?

281
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,339
- Okay, man.

282
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,139
Just trust me, black, he'll
be here, man, he'll be here.

283
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,470
- All right, make sure he'll be here.

284
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,410
You got it.

285
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,361
10 more minutes, okay?

286
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,845
- He said he'd show up, he'll show up.

287
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,798
- [Club Man] Make sure he does.

288
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:22,381
- Don't worry.

289
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,241
Don't worry.

290
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,979
- Trap, yeah.

291
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,910
Now, I ain't got nothing
against Russians and that,

292
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,886
you know, but they'll buy
anything from you, you know?

293
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:32,371
I took a trip out there last summer.

294
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,859
I was gonna buy, you know,
100 boxes of Cheerios.

295
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:37,043
You know what I'm saying?

296
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,787
I showed 'em selling one
box of Cheerios for $100.

297
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:41,620
You know?

298
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,866
They bought 'em, I sold out!

299
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:44,734
You know what I told them it was?

300
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,155
I told 'em it was donut seeds.

301
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:48,115
You know what I'm saying?

302
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,118
(crowd shouts)

303
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:49,951
You understanding?

304
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:51,541
- [Robbie] Where's he at?

305
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,479
- He'll be here, don't worry.

306
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,588
There he is!

307
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:57,546
- Hey, hey, what's happening?

308
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:59,079
- [Club Man] Yo', glad you could make it!

309
00:09:59,079 --> 00:09:59,912
Tell me how you've been!

310
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:02,085
(people murmur)

311
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,114
- [Happnens] Oh man!

312
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:05,797
- [Club Goer] Is she that bad?

313
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:06,909
- [Robbie] Are you ready to go?

314
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:10,042
- Man, I am ready to get busy!

315
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,018
- Right, right, all right.

316
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,639
What's your real name, anyway?

317
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,704
Don't scratch your head!

318
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:16,221
- Happnens.

319
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,054
- Happnens?

320
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,108
- Yeah.

321
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:19,775
- Yo', this my man, Happnens, this man.

322
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,023
- Hey, man, he's a bum, he's filthy!

323
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,282
- Man, but this my act!

324
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:25,181
- Look man, I'm only doing this
because you were persistent.

325
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,493
- [Robbie] Oh man.

326
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,561
- Hey man, the next time your act comes,

327
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,035
you make sure he's here on time.

328
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:32,538
- Okay.

329
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:33,745
- Hey, man, he's filthy, man.

330
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:34,578
- But, he's good.

331
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:35,922
- All right, then, look,
I'm going to tell the people

332
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:38,279
out there that he'll be the
last contestant to come on.

333
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,112
- Okay.

334
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,453
- All right, and then,
after that, he's on.

335
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,647
Hey, man, this dude is a bum.

336
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:45,830
Are you sure this your act, man?

337
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,749
- This is my act, man.

338
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:47,582
He's good, so--

339
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:49,287
- Okay, you make sure he's good.

340
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,911
That's what I'm concerned
about, all right?

341
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:53,478
- Man, it's, I appreciate it.

342
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,428
- All right, you make sure he's good.

343
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:55,761
He's a bum, man.

344
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,094
- Don't worry about him.

345
00:10:59,094 --> 00:10:59,927
I'm going out there and have it--

346
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:00,760
- You gonna knock 'em out?

347
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,593
- Man, we got this--

348
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:02,426
- That's all I'm worried about.

349
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:03,259
You just lay 'em out, okay?

350
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,092
- Let me just go do this.

351
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:04,925
I can do this.

352
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:05,885
- Just do it, let's do
it, but take a bath!

353
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:09,021
- [Happnens] I know what's up!

354
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:11,111
- Yeah, you know, I remember
the first day of school.

355
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:13,885
Me and my partners, we was
all going to school, you know.

356
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:15,908
You know, I was with a couple
of my partners over here

357
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,507
and a couple of my partners
over there and I'm like,

358
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:18,555
"What's up, partners?

359
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:19,749
"This is my partner, Tyrone.

360
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:22,008
"This is Jackass and this is Kevin."

361
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,236
You know, we all talking
about it and they like,

362
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,293
"Hey, Jackass!"

363
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:25,126
You know what I'm saying?

364
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:25,959
They go over there.

365
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,250
You know, "Why you call
him Jackass and shit?"

366
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,523
I said, "Aw man, we always
called him that, man.

367
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,507
"The name Jackass, don't
even worry about it."

368
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,768
Then, later, the other
partner came over there say,

369
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:37,346
"Hey, man, why is partner
calling you Jackass, man?"

370
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:41,787
Homeboy said, "Well he-yaw
he-yaw'lways call me that!"

371
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:46,787
(crowd laughs)
(crowd claps)

372
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,621
- Okay, wasn't he funny, y'all?

373
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:54,029
Okay, let's calm down, please.

374
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,850
Okay, for our final act this evening,

375
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,183
we have the Bay Area's new talent.

376
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:02,124
Let's welcome him, Happnens.

377
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:02,957
(crowd applauds)

378
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,707
Come on up here, now.

379
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,412
- Oh no!
- Yeah!

380
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:10,287
- Homeboy, what's up?

381
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,940
- What's up?

382
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,316
- Hey, how's everybody doing today?

383
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,581
- Okay.
- Fine!

384
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:15,854
- [Happnens] All right, I'm Happnens.

385
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,626
I don't know who you is,
really don't give a fuck but...

386
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:18,459
- It's all right.

387
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:19,322
- [Happnens] Check it out.

388
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,778
- Hey, man, St. Anthony's
Church is on 5th and Mission.

389
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:24,122
- Yeah, man, I seen you there last time.

390
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,074
Don't be trying to steal my bread no more.

391
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,268
(crowd chuckles)

392
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:30,138
But, you know, now and
days we live in a time

393
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:32,730
when you gotta have what
they call safe sex, huh?

394
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,106
Man.

395
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:35,130
When I had safe sex,

396
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,059
all you had to have
was a padded headboard.

397
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,938
These days, you gotta be really prepared.

398
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,250
You know what I'm saying?

399
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,903
- What the hell does this
clown think he's doing.

400
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:43,727
Wait a minute, man, ain't
that the homie that kick

401
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:45,711
at the bus stop telling jokes?

402
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,804
- I think that is.

403
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:50,372
- Got my food stamp ID card and shit.

404
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:53,849
Nobody wants to give me
change for a $5 coupon!

405
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,131
I said, "This federal currency.

406
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,330
"What the problem, dog?"

407
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,514
Man, these butt cracks didn't even want--

408
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:01,847
- Oh lord, wait until
Tori hears about this.

409
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,680
- I'm trying to get a transfer

410
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,538
and he don't want to take my food stamps.

411
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,039
What the fuck's you
doing down around here?

412
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,894
You know what I'm saying?

413
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:09,250
So, I got off the bus
and I keep on walking.

414
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,750
Who do I run into?

415
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,394
Another cool little honey
that want to get with me.

416
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,333
(ladies giggle)

417
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,916
Man, you know I got my shit together.

418
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,058
I be walking along.

419
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:21,103
She trying to get with me.

420
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:22,970
She said, "Come on, get in the car."

421
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,282
I said, "Cool."

422
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,959
So, I jump in the ride with baby and we go

423
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,644
for a nice, little ride and
everything and you know,

424
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:31,108
man, baby just pulled
over, nice little spot

425
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:33,818
and we had KBLX Jam and
everything was going real cool.

426
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:36,175
You know what I'm saying?

427
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:38,735
Baby said, "Well, what you like to do?"

428
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,935
I said, "Well, baby,
you know, I'm flexible."

429
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,162
You know I am!

430
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:45,756
(crowd snickers)

431
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:48,442
Baby say, "Well, I feel like,

432
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,850
"you know, getting a little freaky."

433
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,877
I said, "Cool."

434
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:53,678
So, she took her false teeth out,

435
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:54,724
then she pulled her skirt off.

436
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:57,623
All this cellulite and shit popped out.

437
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,036
Big, old, fat titties hanging down

438
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,359
to the back of her knees.

439
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,671
Hair fell out.

440
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:06,115
I'm like, "Oh no! What's going on today?"

441
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,192
And I really appreciate y'all.

442
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,602
My name is Happnens.

443
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,435
I had a good time.

444
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:10,330
Thank you, see you!

445
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,530
(crowd cheers)

446
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,471
- Hey, must be ready to clap!

447
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,330
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

448
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,908
a round of applause.

449
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:20,866
Weren't they good?

450
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,362
Weren't they great?

451
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,195
Yeah!

452
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,028

455
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,714
All right, thank you.

456
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:32,388
(crowd claps)

457
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,602
- Oh man!

458
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:34,690
- That was so good.

459
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,741
Wasn't he so good?

460
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:37,754
- He did.

461
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:38,607
- [Girlfriend] That was great.

462
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm glad he's made it!

463
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,740
- [Robbie] I'm glad he made it here.

464
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,351
- Oh, it was so funny!

465
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,471
- Oh, thank you, I appreciate that.

466
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,793

467
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,095
- Aw man, I told you I

468
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,207
- Man, I tell you, you're
a shoe in for the win.

469
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,284
You were great, you were marvelous.

470
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:50,117
- Aw, right on man!

471
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:50,970

472
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,823
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.

473
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:52,772
Okay.

- All right, damn!

481
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,870
- Man, I'm glad everything
worked out cool.

482
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,703
We kind of came up.

483
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,267
- Hi, my name is Todd McPherson.

484
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,178
I'm a promoter.

485
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:07,482
How'd you like to open for
Eddie Murphy next week?

486
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:10,455
You'll make $20,000 for
a 30 minute routine.

487
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:11,898
(Happnens gasps)

488
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:12,975
- No shit!

00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,290
Next week, me open for Eddie Murphy?

490
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,772
Oh lord!

491
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:20,676
And, I was wondering how I
was going to see that show!

492
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:21,914
- Here's my card.

493
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:22,747
You have an agent?

494
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,099
- Oh man!

495
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,016
Yeah, I do!

496
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,503

- So, is that a go or no?

503
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:37,370
- [Robbie] Hey, it's a go.

504
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,874

Got to get you cleaned up,

00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,437

517
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:59,311
- Yo', yo', dude, the outfit worked.

518
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:00,228
- [Happnens] Aw man!

519
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,116
See, I told you, man,

Yeah, yeah, oh, man.

00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,994
- Excuse me while I say
a few things to my girl.

524
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,202
- Aw, Robert.

525
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,775
Cool, man, but you know, Robert?

526
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:11,608
- Uh-huh?

527
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:12,612
- If it hadn't been for you, man,

528
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:13,924
none of this would have even happened.

529
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,886
As far as I'm concerned,

530
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,730
- Hey, that's cool.

531
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,735
That's on.

532
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:20,193
- Cool.

533
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:21,693
- Smile, oh, baby!

534
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,373
- Yes, I done came up with 20 G's!

535
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:27,343
Incredible!

536
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,796
- Character number one, Troy Bradford,

537
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:38,392
known as Happnens, is
a very, very funny man

538
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:41,412
and this is where it all started for him.

539
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:43,745
Was it luck, fate or timing?

540
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,333
We'll let you decide.

541
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,447
- You know those people who
make life hard for themselves?

542
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,892
Well, people, I got
one for you right here.

543
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,943
Yes, I'm talking about busters.

544
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:03,258
I'm talking about side-busters

545
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:07,341
and this one here has a
serious, serious problem.

546
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,936
- Alvin, I just want
you to cut costs, okay?

547
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:11,769
- I, I--

548
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:12,602
- I don't care how you do it.

549
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:13,435
- Great, I understand, boss man.

550
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:14,268
- Okay.

551
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,101
- I won't let you down.

552
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,059
I'm not even, Bob, Bob?

553
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:16,892
- Okay.

554
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,082
- Hey, what's up? (chuckles)

555
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,554
Tell me, what's a fine thing like you

556
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:26,362
doing out on a fine day like this, huh?

557
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:27,770
Hey?

558
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,978
Hey, what's the problem, huh?

559
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,580
What is it, I'm not white enough for ya'?

560
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,758
- No, the problem is
you're not black enough.

561
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:40,008
- (scoffs) Oh, later for you guys.

562
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:46,594
- Yeah, no.

563
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,530
No, baby, the sexual issue is an all-time

564
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,322
low priority to me.

565
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:53,155
Seriously, yeah, yeah.

566
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:56,059
What?

567
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,071
No. (chuckles)

568
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,650
No, no.

569
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,483
Come on.

570
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:00,932
What's important to me?

571
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:02,520
Compatibility.

572
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,524
Yeah, compatibility.

573
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,613
If our personalities
can't blend, you know,

574
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:07,226
then it's not on.

575
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:09,135
That's right, it's not on, yeah.

576
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:10,244
Well, (chuckles).

577
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,077
No, but

578
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:12,784
(Alvin whistles)

579
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,564
it sounds like you been
dealing with them brothers...

580
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:16,218
No, see.

581
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:17,540
See, no.

582
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,373
It's a lack--

583
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:19,215
- What's going on, Cliff, buddy?

584
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,048
- Hold on, hold on.

585
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:20,881
What?

586
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:21,714
- Well, you got to end close.

587
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:22,682
There's another meeting.

588
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:24,644
- Look, man, I'm on my lunch hour.

589
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,477
Okay?

590
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:27,759
And, second of all, you're
not my boss, brother, okay?

591
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,370
As much as you may want to be.

592
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,458
All right, fair enough.

593
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,045
- Nah, Cliff, squash that.

594
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,541
I need those reports.

595
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,938
I got people upstairs waiting.

596
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,217
I got things to do.

597
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,364
I need those reports.

598
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:39,447
- Look, man, I don't know

599
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:40,280
what the fuck your problem is, man,

600
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,179
but you can come see me
later in my office, okay?

601
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,012
Okay?

602
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,389
See ya' later.

603
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:46,914
Office, later.

604
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:47,747
Bye now.

605
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:48,846
- Yeah, I'll be there, I'll be there.

606
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:49,679
- I'm sure you will--

607
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,637
- Believe me, I will.

608
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:51,470
- Uh-huh.

609
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,686
Hello.

610
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,350
Hello?

611
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,183
Hello?

612
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,101
Damn!

613
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,609
- Hey, Marie, what's shakin'?

614
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:24,974
- What, Alvin?

615
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:28,398
- Well, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

616
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,745
You're a full-blooded
Latin American, aren't you?

617
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:31,745
- Yes, I am.

618
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:33,731
- Good.

619
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:37,059
You know, you have very beautiful eyes.

620
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,929
- Thanks, Alvin, but they're
only brown like yours.

621
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,571
- Come on, Marie.

622
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,587
I mean, you know I've had the hots for you

623
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,550
ever since I laid my eyes on you, huh?

624
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,587
You don't give me the time of day.

625
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,902
That's okay because I'll
tell ya' what, little lady,

626
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,046
one of these days you're
going to wake up and

627
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:55,629
all you're gonna think
about is me, Big Al.

628
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:57,338
- Yeah right.

629
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:00,243
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
like to get back to work.

630
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:02,787
(Marie types)

631
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:06,287
(machine whirs and beeps)

632
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,627
- Hey, Cliff.

633
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:19,747
- Hey, Laura, how you doing?

634
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:20,633
- Pretty good.

635
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,073
You know, I wanted to
thank you for updating

636
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,843
the accounts for the north wing.

637
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:24,963
You know, if it wasn't for you,

638
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,075
I don't think this company
would be as stable as it is.

639
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:27,908
- Thanks, Laura.

640
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,302
Listen, what are the
chances of me accessing

641
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:31,463
those central area office files?

642
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,802
I'm kind of interested in getting an idea

643
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:35,543
of exactly how far ahead we are.

644
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,625
- Sure, tell you what, I'm
going back to my office

645
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,139
in a few minutes, so come through

646
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,390
and I'll punch it up on
the computer for you.

647
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,223
- Excellent, thanks!

648
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:43,056
- Hi, you guys.

649
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:43,889
How you doing?

650
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:44,722
- Hey!
- How are you?

651
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:46,350
- Here are those files you asked for.

652
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,801
- Oh, thanks.

653
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,379
Sharon, how's the poetry coming?

654
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:50,915
- Oh, it's doing real good!

655
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:52,561
Actually, I just finished one.

656
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:53,401
Want to hear it?

657
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:54,234
- [Cliff] Yeah!

658
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:55,067
- Well, okay.

659
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:55,900
- [Laura] Go for it!

660
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,733
- Okay.

661
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:57,569
This one is called The
State of The World Today.

662
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,652
- [Laura] All right.

663
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:03,065
- I often pray for the
state of the world today

664
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:05,401
because there seems to be a defect

665
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,129
in the governments we elect

666
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:10,796
like why money for bombs
would take priority

667
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:15,586
over education is totally beyond me.

668
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,883
It seems our democracy
is full of loop holes,

669
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:22,265
double standards and hypocrisy.

670
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,950
There's homelessness and hunger.

671
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,463
The poor stay weak.

672
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,363
Only the rich get stronger.

673
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:31,561
It's a catch-22, not meant for me and you,

674
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,454
only a select few.

675
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:35,500
And, the darker your skin tone,

676
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,827
the less you belong.

677
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,566
Power is used in a conniving way

678
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,605
helping some countries commit murder

679
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:45,433
while others are made to pay

680
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,321
like in Iraq.

681
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,441
Hussein was definitely to blame,

682
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:51,545
but what about the clerk?

683
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:54,222
I mean, shouldn't he be charged the same?

684
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,611
I mean, why turn a blind
eye on South Africa,

685
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:58,809
black lives in pain.

686
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:00,814
It seems to me it's the same crime.

687
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:03,321
Why not the same time?

688
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,018
Then, there's the diplomatic bureaucracy

689
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,899
importing all the drugs into our country,

690
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:10,243
but in the end,

691
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:11,257
the little dealer on the corner

692
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:14,445
is the only one to pay for the sin.

693
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:17,998
Even the police department
paid to protect you and me.

694
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:21,619
It's full of corruption and conspiracy.

695
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:26,452
But, what should we expect
from these hypocrites we elect?

696
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:30,222
Either way, it's really sad to say

697
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:34,126
that's the state of the
world we live in today.

698
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:34,959
- [Laura] Great!

699
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:35,792
- [Cliff] That was deep!

700
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,753
- Oh, I'm so glad y'all like it.

701
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:38,862
Thank you, thank you!

702
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:41,273
But, anyway, people, I-owe, I-owe,

703
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:42,937
so back to work I go.

704
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:43,770
Bye-bye!

705
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,980
- Bye-bye!
- Take care!

706
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,813
(phone rings)

707
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:48,091
Oh, excuse me, phone.

708
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:49,283
Hello?

709
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:50,423
Oh, hi, how are you doing?

710
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:51,577
Listen, can you hold on for a sec'?

711
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,689
Laura, look, I need about 15 minutes

712
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,654
and I'll come on over and
view those files, okay?

713
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:57,487
- Okay, oh sure.

714
00:22:57,487 --> 00:22:58,320
Take your time.

715
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,323
I'm on my way back there now,
so I'll talk to you later.

716
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:02,323
And, once again, thanks.

717
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,829
(Alvin whistles)

718
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,615
- I wish I was white.

719
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:22,755
That'd be the only way
I could do what he does.

720
00:23:22,755 --> 00:23:26,243
I've got to impress the
boss to get this promotion.

721
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:27,193
How can I cut costs?

722
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:28,961
- Ted, just get it on my desk by Tuesday.

723
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:29,794
I don't care how you do it.

724
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,211
Just get it here, okay?

725
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:33,645
- Hey, are we still hooking up tonight?

726
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,478
Oh yeah?

727
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:37,305
Okay, yeah, I can't handle
that flaking going on.

728
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:38,138
- How's it going?

729
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:38,971
(Cliff chuckles)

730
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:40,322
Cliff, did you get through those reports?

731
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:41,635
- Yeah, okay.

732
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,438
Yeah-huh, uh-huh.

733
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,844
Be right with you.

734
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:45,943
Yeah, so we...

735
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:47,481
All right, look, look, look.

736
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,070
- Come on, Cliff, we're
on company time now.

737
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,307
I'm going to need those reports.

738
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:51,694
- Eight o'clock.

739
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:53,177
I'll confirm my ride with you.

740
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:54,403
All right, sweetie?

741
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:55,394
All right.

742
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,550
(Cliff chuckles)

743
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,587
Take care, all right, goodbye.

744
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,025
- Cliff, I need those reports, man.

745
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,993
(Cliff sighs)

746
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:06,553
- Buster, you got to do me a favor though.

747
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:07,395
After you look at my file--

748
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:08,228
- Yeah, sure.

749
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:10,851
- Find a short pier, take a long walk.

750
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,281
There you go.

751
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:13,114
- Ha. Ha.

752
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:14,007
- [Cliff] I don't work for you, man.

753
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:14,840
Go ahead.

754
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,673
- I will.

755
00:24:15,673 --> 00:24:18,030
Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see.

756
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,110
(Alvin murmurs)

757
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,497
The second quarter then.

758
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:22,497
Interesting!

759
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:26,841
According to this, we're
up to par on all accounts.

760
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,920
In fact, we're doing better
this quarter than we ever have.

761
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,753
- No shit.

762
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:34,318
- How will I know what
Bob expect me to do?

763
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,151
- What?

764
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,003
You got a problem with the books, man?

765
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:37,123
You got a problem?

766
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:38,286
- Yeah, yeah!

767
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,523
I got a problem.

768
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:40,558
- Okay, what's your problem, man.

769
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:41,731
- Yeah, it's people like
you that make it hard

770
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,065
for people like me to be accepted

771
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,120
in this white-collar industry.

772
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,954
That's my problem, pal.

773
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,481
- Yeah, all right.

774
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:48,355
Look here, man.

775
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:49,571
You got an identity problem.

776
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,807
You want to be white or something.

777
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:51,811
But, don't take that out on me.

778
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:53,507
See, that's the problem with us today.

779
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:54,595
Instead of working together, man,

780
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:56,334
we bring one another down, man.

781
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:57,283
- What the hell are you talking about?

782
00:24:57,283 --> 00:24:59,545
You watch how you talk
around these white people!

783
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:02,190
They're our ticket to the
Promised Land and I want in.

784
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,086
You hear me?

785
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,121
Well, what do you expect?

786
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,406
It's like they say, if you
can't beat 'em, join 'em, huh?

787
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,465
- My God, Alvin, Alvin, Alvin.

788
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:11,644
Your nose is stuck so far up Bob's ass,

789
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,563
it's a wonder flies ain't
swirling around your head, man.

790
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:15,939
When you going to realize
you nothing but a puppet

791
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:18,147
controlled by white strings, huh, huh?

792
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:21,240
It's a shame that you feel
like in order to be successful

793
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,078
in today's world, man,
you got to be white.

794
00:25:24,078 --> 00:25:26,169
You know, the reality of the
situation is this, my brother.

795
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:27,544
Take a look in the mirror.

796
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:28,502
Your hair's nappy,

797
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:30,542
your nose is broad and fleshy

798
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:34,145
and you have a natural sense of rhythm.

799
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:36,865
Well, maybe not the rhathymia. (chuckles)

800
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:38,873
Bottom line is this, bruh, you're black

801
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:40,899
and you always will be black

802
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,979
and you cannot run from your identity.

803
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:44,183
- No, no, man, nuh-uh.

804
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:45,134
You're wrong.

805
00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:47,551
My identity is fittin' there.

806
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:49,945
- Yeah, okay.

807
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:51,459
Whatever, man.

808
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:52,292
(Cliff chuckles)

809
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:55,292
I'm thinking bro' has got a problem.

810
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,864
Since things are finished here,

811
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:01,635
I'm going to Barclay and see

812
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:04,557
those two new recruits he just hired.

813
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:07,140
There was one in spandex today.

814
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:13,934
- Come in, come in.

815
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:14,947
I'll get back to you later.

816
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:15,780
I'll talk about it.

817
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,613
Come in.

818
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:19,113
(door knocks)

819
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:24,995
- Thanks.

820
00:26:24,995 --> 00:26:26,073
Sorry to disturb you, boss.

821
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:27,043
- Have a seat.

822
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,514
What is it?

823
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:31,777
- It seems the auditing
department is doing so well,

824
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,891
they got a lot of slack
time on their hands.

825
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,502
I mean, every time I see that Cliff,

826
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:38,755
the guy's either taking a
late lunch or on the phone.

827
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,579
My proposal is this,

828
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:42,605
if we can increase the responsibilities

829
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:45,123
within that department,
we can trim the staff

830
00:26:45,123 --> 00:26:46,830
thus saving the company thousands

831
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,547
of dollars in salaries alone.

832
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:49,560
- Good idea, Alvin.

833
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,723
You keep bringing me ideas like that

834
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:52,739
and you'll be promoted in no time.

835
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,328
Now, regarding that convention,

836
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:56,515
when you go down there as the
company sales representative,

837
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,211
just say exactly what I told you to say

838
00:26:58,211 --> 00:26:59,641
and nothing else, okay?

839
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,006
Don't be running your mouth off.

840
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:01,839
I like you, Alvin.

841
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,470
You never overstep your boundaries.

842
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,475
Just keep up the good work

843
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:07,715
and keep bringing me
those good ideas, okay?

844
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:08,771
- Great, boss!

845
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:10,691
Just trying to keep you happy. (chuckles)

846
00:27:10,691 --> 00:27:13,059
If there's anything I can
ever do, just let me know.

847
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,142
I'm your man.

848
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:19,095
(swanky music plays)

849
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,321
- It fascinates me how they
tattle-tell on their own kind.

850
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,550
No sense of loyalty whatsoever.

851
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,606
You know, if Alvin thinks he's going

852
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,731
to make it to the top like
that, he is sadly mistaken.

853
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:34,766
I think I'll just keep him around

854
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,712
until I can't use him any longer.

855
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:41,283
You know, deep down, I think
he wishes he was white.

856
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:43,700
(Bob scoffs)

857
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:59,685
- One day, this'll all be mine.

858
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:03,575
Bob won't soon forget what I did today.

859
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,670
I'm gonna get what's coming to me.

860
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,142
I can see it now.

861
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:10,499
- Talking about backstabbers, man!

862
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:12,310
Why is it that we always got to watch

863
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,321
what we say and do, and
around our own people?

864
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,782
- Ignorance, man.

865
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,553
I mean, it's that kind
of messed up thinking

866
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:21,827
that keeps things the
same, even after 200 years!

867
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:24,601
I mean, the guy has no respect for himself

868
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:27,011
and even less than that for
the next brother or sister!

869
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:28,483
- Yeah, and I bet he's
one of those brothers

870
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:31,033
who doesn't even hold the
doors open for sisters!

871
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:31,866
- Exactly!

872
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:36,985
I've always had a healthy
respect for independent women,

873
00:28:36,985 --> 00:28:39,022
especially the ones with children.

874
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:41,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you

875
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,320
to our next set of characters.

876
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,653
Please welcome, Aminah and her son Mario.

877
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,094
- So Mario, how was school today?

878
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:53,998
- Fine, Mommy.

879
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,854
Can I spend the night over at Mikey's?

880
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,623
- You couldn't wait to ask about that.

881
00:28:57,623 --> 00:28:59,065
Yes, I already called your auntie

882
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:01,123
and Auntie Malaika is coming to pick you

883
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:02,606
up around six o'clock.

884
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:05,038
- Yay, I like getting to
be with Auntie Malaika!

885
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:07,331
- But, are you going to be a big boy

886
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,539
and do all your homework?

887
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,337
- I'm already a big boy, but
for you, Mommy, anything.

888
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,551
- That's my boy!

889
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,806
I got a surprise for you at
home, a brand new Ace hat!

890
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,798
- And I got you a surprise!

891
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:20,631
- What?

892
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:21,464
- It's a bouquet!

893
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,977
- (gasps) Oh!

894
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:26,394
- Mommy, that's embarrassing.

895
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:36,835
- [Marge] Mhmm, a mother knows
everything about her family.

896
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:37,977
- [Lisa] Oh yeah? What's my shoe size?

897
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:38,810
- [Marge] 4 big.

898
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,643
- [Bart] How many teeth do I have?

899
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:41,612
- [Marge] 16 permanent teeth, baby.

900
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:44,195
(Mario laughs)

901
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:47,588
- [Bart] And?

902
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:48,750
- [Marge] Glow-in-the-dark monster makeup.

903
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,583
- [Bart] Impressive.

904
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,636
- [Homer] How many hairs
on my head without looking?

905
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:53,721
- [Marge] Homie, you have lots of hair!

906
00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:57,388
(muffled television noises)

907
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:02,803
- Mommy, where is Daddy?

908
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:09,241
- Honey, your Daddy
won't be back for awhile.

909
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,958
- Will he be coming back?

910
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:22,816
- You see, Mario, your Daddy
liked life in the streets

911
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:25,246
and he got caught up in something real bad

912
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,427
that was going on out here.

913
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:32,427
I don't know why he had to go
out there in the first place.

914
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:36,345
Let's hope my date with
Hank goes well tonight.

915
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:39,277
(door knocks)

916
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:41,860
Wait, Mario, I'll get the door.

917
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,036
Hey, sis!

918
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:44,869
- What's up?

919
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:45,702
- Hey!

920
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:46,573
- Hi Auntie Aminah.

921
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:47,406
- How you doing?

922
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:48,429
- Where's Mario?

923
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,462
- He's not here.

924
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:50,879
- Mikey, come on!

925
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,200
- Him and that Nintendo!

926
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,033
(Aminah chuckles)

927
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:55,866
So, what's up, sis?

928
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:56,699
How you been doing?

929
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,519
- I've been doing fine.

930
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,352
- Oh, that's good!

931
00:30:59,352 --> 00:31:01,935
(boys clatter)

932
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:06,723
- You can see it, but
don't take that tag off.

933
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,973
(Nintendo plays music)

934
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,597
- So, how's the new job?

935
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:21,667
Life at the IRS treating you right.

936
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,776
- As good as any other job.

937
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:26,925
- What is this smile on your face?

938
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:28,534
You got a new date this evening?

939
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,253
- Oh God sends you and now you're daring

940
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,397
to mention a date, I
should know you by now.

941
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:33,848
- Now, who is this guy?

942
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,459
Tell me about him.

943
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,539
- His name is Hank.

944
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:38,605
- Hank?

945
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,397
- And, he's cool.

946
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:43,138
- Oh, so he's cool, huh?

947
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:45,303
What else do you know about this guy

948
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,175
besides the fact that he's so cool?

949
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:50,592
- Well, I know that he's fine

950
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:54,061
and I know that he's a
youth probation officer.

951
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:55,373
- Now that's cool!

952
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,059
He has a job and everything.

953
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,280
But, honey, this is the 90's
and you have to be careful,

954
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,540
learn what's on the inside of this man.

955
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,464
You be careful, honey,
this might be a snake.

956
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:06,297
- Hey.

957
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:09,144
When are you gonna let me grow up

958
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:12,182
and start living my own life?

959
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,837
- Honey, I don't care what you say

960
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:15,928
or how many times you say it,

961
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:19,117
you gonna always be my little baby sister.

962
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,880
Now, I'll be damned if I sit back

963
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,387
and let you continue to make
mistakes after mistakes--

964
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,275
- After mistakes, after mistakes.

965
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:27,108
That was in the past.

966
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:28,813
When are you going to let me
grow up and run my own life?

967
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,875
- Honey, I'm not trying to run your life.

968
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,923
I'm just concerned of men.

969
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:37,037
You know, I admit you're
doing fine as a single parent,

970
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:39,277
but see, I can't relate to that,

971
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:42,113
but watching raise Mario,
honey, I know it's hard.

972
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:44,120
- Oh no, you don't know how hard it is.

973
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,661
You have a big, six-figure
digit job coming home

974
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,466
with a husband, the white
picket fence, the whole nine.

975
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:51,800
While you sittin' up there in the hills,

976
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,749
I'm sitting down here.

977
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:53,987
You don't know how hard it is,

978
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:58,131
so don't say you know hard
it is because you don't.

979
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:00,120
- Why every time I come here,
I have to argue with you

980
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,773
because you think I'm
trying to run your life?

981
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,384
- You are trying to run my life!

982
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:04,611
- I'm not trying to run your life!

983
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,557
I'm just a little concerned.

984
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,717
Let's reminisce.

985
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:09,717
- Let's not!

986
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:13,197
- Remember when that asshole,
Amiricol, was around?

987
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:16,483
How you thought he was so sweet and sexy?

988
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:19,437
Because, you see, every
evening he came by here,

989
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:22,275
he bought you all these
little dead-ass roses.

990
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:25,448
He nibble and kiss on
your navel and your thighs

991
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:27,320
and after all that shit,

992
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,952
he asked you to get out of his life

993
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:32,067
and he ends up being the
biggest asshole in Oakland.

994
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,200
- Well, for your information,
it's none of your business

995
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,373
if he was an asshole!

996
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:37,409
Amiricol was a good man
to me when he was around

997
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:40,077
and he was a good father to
Mario when he was around.

998
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:40,910
You don't know!

999
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,575
You come from your goddamn
fairy-land world across the way

1000
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:45,421
coming over here trying to run my life.

1001
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:47,757
A male's already a good thing for me,

1002
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:50,189
so don't come over here
and start no shit with me!

1003
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:52,611
You always pull that
little baby sister shit

1004
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:53,965
and I can't take it no more!

1005
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,442
I don't want that little baby shit.

1006
00:33:57,442 --> 00:33:58,859
For your information, me and Amiricol

1007
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:00,813
had a simple misunderstanding.

1008
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:02,980
- Simple misunderstanding?

1009
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:06,115
Honey, you mean...

1010
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,376
First of all, understanding
is the most important

1011
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:10,381
essence in any relationship

1012
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,197
and you mean to tell me you
call a simple misunderstanding

1013
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,907
someone who tells you, not asks,

1014
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:18,167
but tells you to have an abortion

1015
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,312
when you nine months pregnant

1016
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:21,974
and after he realized he can't take care

1017
00:34:21,974 --> 00:34:23,619
of responsibilities around here

1018
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:26,296
of raising Mario and being a father,

1019
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:29,088
he tells you to get the
hell out of his life

1020
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,469
and you do and do he ever care?

1021
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,824
Hell no!

1022
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:36,525
So you don't come at me about
no simple misunderstanding.

1023
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:40,692
To me, my sister, that was
a big misunderstanding.

1024
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,029
Look, Aminah, I did not
come here to argue with you.

1025
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,611
- Well, just leave then!

1026
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:51,197
- Aminah, honey, I'm sorry.

1027
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:52,030
Look.

1028
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:54,275
Look, look, look at me.

1029
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:58,421
You are a beautiful,
independent black woman

1030
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:01,816
and I want you to hold on to that image.

1031
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:03,363
I'm not trying to run your life, honey.

1032
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:04,560
I just love you.

1033
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,432
Come here, give me a hug.

1034
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:06,349
I love you.

1035
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:09,453
(video game blares)

1036
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,149
- Come on, Mikey, let's go.

1037
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,482
Take off my hat.

1038
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,194
- You do love me.

1039
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:21,344
Come on, boys.

1040
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:23,468
Is all of Mario's stuff in this bag?

1041
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:25,135
- It's all in there.

1042
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:28,675
- Come on.

1043
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:30,571
God, y'all slow as kids.

1044
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:32,279
Give your Mama a hug.

1045
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:33,773
- Come here, child.

1046
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,275
Bye, baby.

1047
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:36,984
Have a good time.

1048
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,755
- Oh, we will.

1049
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:40,896
But, you be careful, baby, okay?

1050
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:42,146
And watch this.

1051
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:49,135
(Aminah sighs)

1052
00:35:49,135 --> 00:35:50,979
- I'm glad that's over.

1053
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:53,646
I'm ready for my date with Hank.

1054
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,742
(swanky music plays)

1055
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,563
- Damn, was that another steps?

1056
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:04,973
Let's see.

1057
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:05,806
301.

1058
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:08,526
302.

1059
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:12,077
303!

1060
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:13,261
All right.

1061
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:14,828
Let's get it together.

1062
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:17,420
(door knocks)

1063
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,420
Yeah, I think it's cool.

1064
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:24,842
- Hi!

1065
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:25,675
- [Hank] Hi, how you doin', Aminah?

1066
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:26,508
These are for you!

1067
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:27,585
- Oh, thank you!

1068
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,793
Flowers, wine and candy and stuff.

1069
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:30,710
Come on in.

1070
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,564
- Thank you.

1071
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,089
- [Aminah] Well, have a seat
and make yourself comfortable.

1072
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:37,922
- Thank you.

1073
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:39,122
- [Aminah] I'm gonna go
put this in some water.

1074
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:39,955
- Okay.

1075
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:43,607
Mmm, yeah, it's on tonight.

1076
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:45,300
(TV sounds play)

1077
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,467
Hey, Triple Flick Justine.

1078
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:50,870
- Lord knows he needs it!

1079
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,703
(track laughter plays)

1080
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:53,601
Oh Daddy, these are the kinds
of times, I just don't know.

1081
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,108
Lord, baby, go and pray for me.

1082
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:58,025
- Hey, Pop, guess what?

1083
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:08,108
- So, food's almost ready!

1084
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:08,941
- [Hank] Thank you.

1085
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:09,847
- In the meantime, why don't you tell me

1086
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:13,079
what it's like being a big
youth probation officer?

1087
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,327
- I like it, you know.

1088
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:16,247
It gives me a chance
to work with the kids.

1089
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:18,135
I listen to 'em,

1090
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,108
I listen to their problems,

1091
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,701
talk to 'em, tell what they gotta do,

1092
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:27,041
listen to what their
parents are doing with them.

1093
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,087
They just give me a chance to work

1094
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:31,735
and really give back to the
children of our community.

1095
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:33,739
I mean, we got a few
knuckleheads in the bunch

1096
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,906
but we work those out too.

1097
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:38,135
We work them out.

1098
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:41,110
So, how is your job at the IRS?

1099
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,252
- I don't want to talk about it now,

1100
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:43,735
but we still work people a lot

1101
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:45,793
doing the same thing, you know, but...

1102
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:47,922
- When is the IRS gonna come see me?

1103
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:49,719
- Oh, they won't come rip you off.

1104
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,711
I'll make sure of that.

1105
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:51,878
- I like that.

1106
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:54,708
So, how is Mario?

1107
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,607
- He's not in tonight.

1108
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,569
He won't be in.

1109
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,223
- All right.

1110
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,876
- Getting pretty hungry?

1111
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:01,867
- [Hank] Yeah, yeah, I am.

1112
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,041
Is that lasagna you making?

1113
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,375
- Yes, I'm going to go see about it

1114
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:05,932
and why don't you go wash your hands

1115
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:08,182
and the food will be ready.

1116
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:11,714
- Okay.

1117
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:24,526
(music plays on TV)

1118
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:31,788
♪ TV Network number one ♪

1119
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,270
- Yeah, that was good.

1120
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,217
All right, good.

1121
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:38,135
- You liked the food?

1122
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:40,056
- I can't say enough about it really.

1123
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:43,466
- My grandmother says
I'm a great cook too.

1124
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,299
- Really?

1125
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:45,388
- I'm glad you think so.

1126
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:46,571
- What about later?

1127
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,908
What else do you have for me?

1128
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:51,831
- All that depends on what
subject you talking about.

1129
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:52,810
- Subjects?

1130
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,212
I'm not talking about subjects.

1131
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,847
I'm just talking about
physical, me and you.

1132
00:38:57,847 --> 00:39:01,249
- You mean like physical
exercise, golf, what?

1133
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:02,817
Sunday morning jog?

1134
00:39:02,817 --> 00:39:05,473
- Naw, not jogging or exercise really.

1135
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:08,396
Physical exercise within the house.

1136
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:11,095
- (chuckles) Watch what you say, Hank.

1137
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,407
- But, what are you talking about?

1138
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:14,305
Would you like some more wine?

1139
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:15,681
- No.

1140
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:16,716
- All right, I guess I'll have it.

1141
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:18,252
- You don't need anymore either.

1142
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:21,255
- Naw, I do if I got to talk to you.

1143
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:22,255
I need this.

1144
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,461
(low tones play)

1145
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:35,795
Come on, come over here.

1146
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:38,369
- Now, Hank.

1147
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,202
- What you talking about?

1148
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,971
- I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

1149
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:42,284
- Nah, nah, darling.

1150
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:44,054
Don't start tripping now, you know.

1151
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:46,004
- I'm not tripping.

1152
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,095
- What are you talking about?

1153
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,897
- I'm serious, Hank.

1154
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:49,813
I'm serious!

1155
00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:54,189
I didn't know you were
this aggressive , Hank!

1156
00:39:54,189 --> 00:39:55,022
- Damn!

1157
00:39:57,644 --> 00:40:00,061
(Hank sighs)

1158
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:04,482
Damn.

1159
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:06,839
Why?

1160
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,589
Why are you tripping?

1161
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,284
So, why are you frowning?

1162
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:15,415
Wipe that frown off your face.

1163
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,313
What you tripping off of?

1164
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:19,730
Get that frown off your face.

1165
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:33,325
Aw man.

1166
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:37,654
I ain't gonna be chasing
you all over the place.

1167
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:38,487
Hey, check it out.

1168
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:39,692
Let's just work this out.

1169
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:41,355
Why are you still frowning?

1170
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,735
Why don't you just wipe
that off your face?

1171
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,807
I thought I told you to
wipe that off your face.

1172
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,375
Come here, just, we can work it out.

1173
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:52,375
I just need you to come
here and give me a kiss.

1174
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,517
- Yeah, kiss your ass, all right.

1175
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,412
- Damn, bitch.

1176
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:08,428
She's trippin', man.

1177
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:09,261
Trippin'.

1178
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:14,316
- Shit, Malaika was right.

1179
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:15,767
When are they gonna learn?

1180
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,484
This is the 90's.

1181
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:22,484
Just because a woman's alone
does not mean she's lonely.

1182
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:27,276
I can't believe those Judo
lessons actually paid off.

1183
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,176
- (chuckles) Well, I guess she showed him

1184
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:32,428
a thing or two, huh, Kendal?

1185
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:33,548
Kendal?

1186
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:35,777
Hey, man, are you listening or what?

1187
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:37,237
Kendal, what are you looking at?

1188
00:41:37,237 --> 00:41:40,119
(distant shouts)

1189
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:40,952
Kendal?

1190
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:43,852
- Here we have some of
the most interesting bunch

1191
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:46,367
of characters you've ever seen.

1192
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:49,450
Do you guys know what bad b-boys are?

1193
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:51,565
- Hell, man.

1194
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:52,663
- Trip them people in there, dude.

1195
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,004
- Yeah, fuck them, man.

1196
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:56,556
Shit looks like a yacht
to their ass, you know?

1197
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,644
- I ain't trippin', dude.

1198
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:58,477
- Hey, what's going on?

1199
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,310
- What's up, man?
- What's up.

1200
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,038
(men laugh)

1201
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:02,871
- Hey, what's up, man?

1202
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:05,001
Y'all like shit like slinging that dank?

1203
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:06,870
On the sly, what's up?

1204
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,370
(men chatter)

1205
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:12,430
- So, what's up, man?

1206
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,779
You still slinging that Great White?

1207
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:14,868
- Oh yeah, man.

1208
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:16,022
You know I got to make that money.

1209
00:42:16,022 --> 00:42:16,961
You know what I'm saying?

1210
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:18,273
Matter of fact, we got
to bump this little nack

1211
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:20,011
around the corner, but it's good

1212
00:42:20,011 --> 00:42:20,991
to see y'all brothers again.

1213
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:21,824
Y'all stay in touch.

1214
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:22,657
You know what I'm saying?

1215
00:42:22,657 --> 00:42:24,490
- Hey, man, so y'all selling

1216
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,323
- [Dealer] Oh yeah.

00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:26,156
- [B-Boy] Right on, man.

1218
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:26,989
We'll get with you then, partner.

1219
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:29,334
Man, let's roll on up out of here, man.

1220
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:30,411
- Yeah, you know, weren't them some fools

1221
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:32,926
back in the old days, man?

1222
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,931
Get up out of here man.

1223
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,147
- See them fools a hella lot.

1224
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:38,038
- Yeah, they be some fools

1225
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:39,277
- Damn.

1226
00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:41,951
- Hey man, this rug looking hella crazy.

1227
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:42,784
What's up?

1228
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:43,617
- Shit.

1229
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:45,034
That's what's up.

1230
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:48,385
- [Second B-Boy] It's getting
cold as fuck out here.

1231
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:49,919
I gotta put my jacket on, man.

00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:51,424
Y'all ain't cold in this motherfucker?

00:42:51,424 --> 00:42:52,970
- Naw, man, we chilling good.

1234
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,326
Let's go find us some freaks.

1235
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:55,159
Oh, buddy!

1236
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:55,992
What's up, Luther?

1237
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:56,825
- Hey, what's up man?

1238
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,033
- What's going on, man.

1239
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,086
- Hey man, I got to go to work.

1240
00:43:00,086 --> 00:43:01,057
I'm looking to get my party on.

1241
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,369
You know what that means, bro'.

1242
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:03,414

00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,536
- Okay, yeah, okay, homie.

1416
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:31,392
Now, you know, he's doing his
studies right here in school.

1417
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:34,645
What, you got about 3.5, what?

1418
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:35,829
- You got to go a little bit higher.

1419
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,269

1421
00:48:38,718 --> 00:48:40,105

1422
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:42,772
(ball bouncing)

1423
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:48,736
- Hey, man, didn't I tell
you about selling drugs

1424
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:49,642
in front of my house?

1425
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:52,597
Are you stupid, or something?

1426
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,197
- Don't you have something better to do?

1427
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,203
Can't you see I'm trying to
conduct a business over here?

1428
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:57,523
- [Girl] All right,
what if my brother comes

1429
00:48:57,523 --> 00:48:58,356
over and kicks your butt too?

1430
00:48:58,356 --> 00:48:59,232
- We'll wait for your brother to come up,

1431
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:00,372
but for now, stay out this area.

1432
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:01,247
I'm running a business right here.

1433
00:49:01,247 --> 00:49:02,080
- [Girl] All right.

1434
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,051
Better stay away from this side.

1435
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:03,884
He'll kick your flip.

1436
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:05,312
- Let me see those rings?

1437
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:06,389
What those are for?

1438
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:07,639
- You see that?

1439
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:10,784

00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:14,005
You wanna play some basketball.

1443
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:15,621
- I don't wanna play
basketball right now, Niki.

1444
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:17,163
- Hey, what about you, Ed?

1445
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,475

1446
00:49:18,475 --> 00:49:19,883

00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:32,270

1457
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:35,360
- Plus, they're better to kiss with.

1458
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,856

00:49:57,981 --> 00:49:59,488
Why don't you go play with
somebody else or something?

00:49:59,488 --> 00:50:00,576

- Best to move on, y'all.

1485
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,056
- [Second Young Man] Why don't
you move to the care center?

1486
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:16,181
- Why don't you bust a move to Footlocker?

1487
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:18,184
- [Second Young Man]
That's what I thought!

1488
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,601
(distant muffled speech)

1489
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:34,016

00:50:35,788 --> 00:50:37,408
- [Both] To try to pop the trunk.

1493
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:39,241
- In the dirty street,
the brothers slowly walk.

1494
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:40,085
- What, they doin', Friend?

1495

- Let's lit up in the part of a big plan.

1497
00:50:44,715 --> 00:50:45,548
- Genocide, y'all.

1498
00:50:45,548 --> 00:50:47,840
- The government got the brother
to pop another black man.

1499
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,621

00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,232
Ain't got no money?

1505
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,267
Let her earn it on her knees.

1506
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,100
- All right.

1507
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,261
- My city's under siege and
this neighborhood's tough.

1508
00:50:58,261 --> 00:51:00,427

- Yeah, what.

1511
00:51:02,508 --> 00:51:05,193
- Got fins on fish and the
cane ain't nothing for bait.

1512
00:51:05,193 --> 00:51:06,901
Across the street, they
down 40 out to float.

1513
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,111
- After 40.

1514
00:51:08,111 --> 00:51:09,481
- And pop to a party.

1515
00:51:09,481 --> 00:51:11,295
I like 'em fast so I can end out.

1516
00:51:11,295 --> 00:51:12,341
Take my hoes on the fall.

1517
00:51:12,341 --> 00:51:13,952
- And fuck with Nintendo.

1518
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:14,880
- Cars roll by slow.

1519
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,733
- [Both] Slammin' a hit.

1520
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:16,960
- That old Blackstone short chair?

1521
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,793
- Super fly pimp shit.

1522
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:22,613

- [Second B-Boy] Man, fuck that bullshit.

1525
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,618
Boy, I'm about to fire up the dank.

1526
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:29,451
- [Bart] Aw man, hold up.

1527
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:31,157
We about to be in the house
in a minute, man, chill.

00:51:31,157 --> 00:51:33,737
We're gonna go chill at the thing.

1529
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:34,792
Aw man.

1530
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:36,213
Dude, I'm ready to pee.

1531
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:37,333
- Hey, look at my homeboy, Slick.

1532
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:38,933
Come on, we could holler
at him for a minute.

1533
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:40,032
- All right.

1534
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:42,532
- Man.
- All right, all right.

1535
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:44,512
What's up Slick?

1536
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:45,504
- [Slick] T-Bonez, what's up, man?

1537
00:51:45,504 --> 00:51:46,421
- What's up, man?

1538
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,921
(men chatter)

1539
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:52,672
- You got a call from someone, huh?

1540
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:53,525
- Oh yeah, I'll be back.

1541
00:51:53,525 --> 00:51:56,308
- We had it going on, man.

1542
00:51:56,308 --> 00:51:58,720
Hey, how many more years of
school you got left, man?

1543
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,849
- Oh, two, two?

1544
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:00,682

I just do my best, man.

1550
00:52:06,445 --> 00:52:08,236
Leave things in the hands
of the lord, brother.

1551
00:52:08,236 --> 00:52:09,771
- Sure thing, man, sure thing.

1552
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:10,901
- I'll check you later, man.

1553
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:11,734
- All right, have a good night.

1554
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:12,629
All right, see you later.

1555
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,726
Are y'all out of here?

1556
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:14,559
All right, man.

1557
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,706
(men chatter)

1558
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:18,196
- Take care.

1559
00:52:18,196 --> 00:52:19,808
- All right, buddy.
- Right.

1560
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:21,246
- Yo', little man, these are
the guys sitting over here

1561
00:52:21,246 --> 00:52:23,571
selling drugs on our fence, man.

1562
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:24,427
- [B-Boy] So, what's really going on?

1563
00:52:24,427 --> 00:52:25,260

She lyin' but you know how I am.

I don't want no more problems.

1566
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:29,525
We'll post up somewhere else.

1567
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:30,880
- Fuck that, man, I like this spot.

1568
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,213
- I mean, what's up with you, dude?

1569
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:34,005
- Man, you don't know who
you fucking with, man.

1570
00:52:34,005 --> 00:52:34,965
Let's be up out of here.

1571
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:37,067
- All right.
- Let's be up.

1572
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:39,264

1573
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:40,895
- Yeah, okay.

1574
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:41,728
- Yo', look, man--

1575
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:42,933

1576
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:45,184
and you're going to smoke some marijuana?

1577
00:52:45,184 --> 00:52:46,228
- Yo', Niki, what's up with you?

1578
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:47,595
Ain't you got a summer
league game or something?

1579
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:49,620
Why don't you go on with all of that?

1580
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,317
- No, but I got a ball
and you can pick a court.

1581
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:52,501
You see you was-been.

1582
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:53,759
Your dad's been mad, huh?

1583
00:52:53,759 --> 00:52:55,179
You ain't nothing but a pothead.

1584
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:57,440
- Niki, get lost before
I tell mom on your ass.

1585
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,773
- Dang, man.

1586
00:52:58,773 --> 00:52:59,915
- Hey, what's up with your sister, man?

1587
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:00,757
- I don't even know man.

1588
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:02,757
She's up in my business.

1589
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:19,050
- Yo', Butch, what's up with
the weights, motherfucker?

1590
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:19,883
- [Butch] No, nigger, get 'em on.

1591
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:20,716
You're the man.

1592
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:21,549
- What's up?

1593
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:22,933
- I ain't got nothing about
lifting no weights anyway.

1594
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:23,872
- Aww man.

1595
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:24,705
- Shut up, dude.

1596
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:26,421
Have a seat, bruh.

1597
00:53:26,421 --> 00:53:27,254
- One,

1598
00:53:27,254 --> 00:53:28,213
two,

1599
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:29,448
three.

1600
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:30,763
- Look, really fire us
up that table, Vern.

1601
00:53:30,763 --> 00:53:32,298
Fire that motherfucker up.

1602
00:53:32,298 --> 00:53:33,503
- [Vern] Come on, man,
you ain't found nothing.

1603
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:34,336
Get going.

1604
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,169
- Hey, bust 'em up, bust 'em up!

1605
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,532

1606
00:53:36,532 --> 00:53:37,877

00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:38,803
Eight.

1608
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:40,040
Nine.

1609
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,981
- Come on, what you hella
fly, watch you hella fly.

1610
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:43,197
- Get your arms around that.

1611
00:53:43,197 --> 00:53:44,371
Yeah, you know?

1612
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:45,204
- I ain't trying.

1613
00:53:45,204 --> 00:53:46,037
- Shit.

1614
00:53:47,412 --> 00:53:48,245
- Tight.

1615
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,162
- One, two.

1616
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,827
Three.

1617
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:52,925
Four.

1618
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:53,971
Five.

1619
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:55,571
Yeah, six.

1620
00:53:55,571 --> 00:53:57,043
Seven.

1621
00:53:57,043 --> 00:53:58,419
Eight.

1622
00:53:58,419 --> 00:53:59,848
Nine.

1623
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:01,040
10.

1624
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,840
- [B-Boy] There you
go, baby, there you go.

1625
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,035
- Come on, man, pass the joint.

1626
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,069
- Oh, you going to get it.

1627
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:10,221
Let me get my place on though.

1628
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:11,138
Yeah, damn.

1629
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:13,265
One.

1630
00:54:13,265 --> 00:54:14,269
Two.

1631
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:15,379
Three.

1632
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:16,212
- [B-Boy] Yeah.

1633
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:17,085
- Four.

1634
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:18,099
Five.

1635
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:19,163
Six.

1636
00:54:19,163 --> 00:54:20,371
Seven.

1637
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,204
- No, man.

1638
00:54:21,204 --> 00:54:22,037
- All right, man.

1639
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:22,899
- [Second B-Boy] Dang, man,
I hit that motherfucker.

1640
00:54:22,899 --> 00:54:23,880
- All right, but if
those ladies call, man,

1641
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,531
from the lake, y'all wake me up

1642
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:26,992
because I'm ready to crash.

1643
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:28,179
Wake me up.

1644
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:29,576
- Man, fuck them hoes.

1645
00:54:29,576 --> 00:54:31,005
They ain't talk about nothing.

1646
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:34,218
- Man, I'm coming up over on
them pretties, tonight, boy.

1647
00:54:34,218 --> 00:54:35,059
I'm going up in something.

1648
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:36,275
- Fuck them, bullshit.

1649
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:37,405
- Yeah, you know.

1650
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:38,238
Dude, oh, hold it.

1651
00:54:38,238 --> 00:54:39,700
Why don't you burn some of
that incense, Lee, my man.

1652
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,344
I got Niki upstairs telling on me.

1653
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:44,189
- Six.

1654
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:45,022
Seven.

1655
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:46,802
Eight.

1656
00:54:46,802 --> 00:54:47,708
- Bust 'em out, bust them arms up.

1657
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:48,541
Come on with it.

1658
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,249
Get yours, yeah.

1659
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:51,082
Yeah.

1660
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,355
Come on, bust 'em up now, man.

1661
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:56,772
Bust that stuff up, you know?

1662
00:54:58,639 --> 00:54:59,827
Yeah, bust 'em up.

1663
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:00,669
- [Second B-Boy] There you go.

1664
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:01,752
Get yours, yeah, get yours.

1665
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:03,169
Pump it up, yeah.

1666
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:10,525
(ball bounces)

1667
00:55:10,525 --> 00:55:14,096
- Niki, I've asked you about
that ball in the house!

1668
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:14,929
- Sorry.

1669
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:15,762
- Sorry?

1670
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:16,595
And what you doin' with that old ball?

1671
00:55:16,595 --> 00:55:17,693
What happened to the ball
that I just bought you?

1672
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:19,581
- That ball don't have
no kind of grip on it.

1673
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:20,784
- Grip?
- Yeah.

1674
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:21,992
- That ball cost money.

1675
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:24,563
That's what you asked for and
that's what you're gonna use.

1676
00:55:24,563 --> 00:55:25,693
- Take it back, I don't want it.

1677
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:26,526
- Take it back?

1678
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:29,113
You asked for it and you're gonna use it.

1679
00:55:29,113 --> 00:55:29,946
- Shoot.

1680
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:31,717
Anyway, Mom, I think
Luther and his friends

1681
00:55:31,717 --> 00:55:34,291
downstairs getting high again as usual.

1682
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,176
- Oh no!

1683
00:55:35,176 --> 00:55:38,269
Sweetheart, thank you for informing me.

1684
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,317
Of all my children, one would have

1685
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,938
to be a consumer of drugs.

1686
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:42,963
- Had to be Luther.

1687
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:44,851
- Sweetheart, just promise me

1688
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:46,323
that you will never do drugs.

1689
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:48,115
It's just not worth it.

1690
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,106
When you see your brother Luther,

1691
00:55:49,106 --> 00:55:52,106
he's going to learn it the hard way.

1692
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,604
Sweetheart, I'll be right back.

1693
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,392
(ball bounces)

1694
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:01,843
Niki, ball!

1695
00:56:01,843 --> 00:56:03,507
- Sorry.

1696
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:04,924
Just bouncing it.

1697
00:56:19,453 --> 00:56:22,227
(Niki coughs)

1698
00:56:22,227 --> 00:56:23,560
- Bust 'em up.

1699
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,451
One day you'll be as big as me, you know?

1700
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:26,504
Yeah.

1701
00:56:26,504 --> 00:56:27,824
Bust it up, yeah.

1702
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:28,669
Get yours.

1703
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:29,776
- What's up, you just talking shit?

1704
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:30,867
- [B-Boy] Oh yeah.

1705
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:34,109
- Get 'em on, get 'em on, baby.

1706
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:35,776
Dude, here come mom.

1707
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:40,541
- What in the hell is going on down here?

1708
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,035
Luther, I know you're
not down here smoking

1709
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:43,603
no dope in my house are you?

1710
00:56:43,603 --> 00:56:44,518
- Nah, we just here lifting weights

1711
00:56:44,518 --> 00:56:46,013
and talking smack to one another.

1712
00:56:46,013 --> 00:56:47,944
- In here lifting weight
and talking smack, huh?

1713
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:48,777
- Yeah, that's all.

1714
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:50,579
- I am sick and tired of this, okay?

1715
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,264
If you guys want to smoke your dope,

1716
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:53,757
you take that outside.

1717
00:56:53,757 --> 00:56:55,080
You understand what I'm saying?

1718
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,913
- Yeah.

1719
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:56,746
- I'm tired of it.

1720
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,165
If you guys wanna smoke your
drugs, take 'em outside.

1721
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,043
I don't want 'em in my house.

1722
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,035
You understand?

1723
00:57:02,035 --> 00:57:03,368
(boys groan)

1724
00:57:03,368 --> 00:57:06,419
Okay, and if you don't
like it, you can leave.

1725
00:57:06,419 --> 00:57:09,181
- [Second B-Boy] All right.

1726
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:10,739
- This is bullshit.

1727
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:11,906
I told you so.

1728
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:16,029
- Man, you gotta do
something about that sister.

1729
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:17,384
- Word, man, don't even worry about it.

1730
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:18,781
I got something for her little ass.

1731
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:19,709
Don't even worry about it, man.

1732
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:20,595
- Man, fuck all that.

1733
00:57:20,595 --> 00:57:21,428
No need to trip.

1734
00:57:21,428 --> 00:57:22,261
Let's get the keys, dude.

1735
00:57:22,261 --> 00:57:23,635
What's up with you
coaching them brews, man?

1736
00:57:23,635 --> 00:57:25,885
- She ain't sayin' nothing.

1737
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:32,947
(men chuckle)

1738
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:36,249
- Imagine that's supposed
to be just a warm-ass beer.

1739
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:37,960
- Nah, man, fuck that.

1740
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,379
- Man, you say that same old shit.

1741
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:42,712
Your ass ends up early every night, man.

1742
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,817
- I did that twice and y'all
tell that same ass story.

1743
00:57:48,817 --> 00:57:50,150
- Fuck out, man.

1744
00:57:51,037 --> 00:57:52,435
- [Second B-Boy] I need to start charging

1745
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:53,523
your ass rent, man.

1746
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:55,101
Why don't you get the tailors on, man?

1747
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:56,701
- [B-Boy] Oh, it's clearing down, man.

1748
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,013
I'm cool, just say no, man.

1749
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,336
(men laugh)

1750
00:57:59,336 --> 00:58:00,648
- [Third B-Boy] If those
pretties call, man,

1751
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:01,481
just let me know.

1752
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,695
Wake me, I'm going to go crash for real.

1753
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:04,733
- Oh yeah, I haven't given you
permission to use the phone

1754
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:07,733
since he gave them
fricks my number anyway.

1755
00:58:07,733 --> 00:58:08,566
You know that?

1756
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:11,066
(phone rings)

1757
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,981
- Hello?

1758
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:15,517
- Hello?

1759
00:58:15,517 --> 00:58:18,364
May I speak to Sammy, please?

1760
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:19,667
- May I ask who's calling?

1761
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:20,605
What's up, nigga'?

1762
00:58:20,605 --> 00:58:21,438
- Peaches.

1763
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:24,776
- It's them bitches, man.

1764
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:25,811
- [B-Boy] For real? For me?

1765
00:58:25,811 --> 00:58:26,644
- Who's that?

1766
00:58:26,644 --> 00:58:28,115
- Sammy, this is Peaches.

1767
00:58:28,115 --> 00:58:29,232
We met at the lake today.

1768
00:58:29,232 --> 00:58:30,399
How you doing?

1769
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:33,703
Fine, thank you.

1770
00:58:33,703 --> 00:58:34,536
- What's up?

1771
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:35,369
- [Third B-Boy] Who's that, man?

1772
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:36,202
- [Peaches] What's up?

1773
00:58:36,202 --> 00:58:37,035
- Oh, Cathy.

1774
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:39,328
(men chatter)

1775
00:58:39,328 --> 00:58:40,331
- [Fourth B-Boy] Let me
holler at them, dude.

1776
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:41,195
- [Second B-Boy] What's up, man?

1777
00:58:41,195 --> 00:58:42,368
Where you going?

1778
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:44,735
(men chatter)

1779
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:47,275
- It's on, it's on there.

1780
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,108
- Don't even trip, man.

1781
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:48,941
- It's on.

1782
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:51,108
- Oh yeah, check this out.

1783
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:55,328
- Yeah.

1784
00:58:56,181 --> 00:58:57,598
Everything is on?

1785
00:58:58,837 --> 00:58:59,915
Right?

1786
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:00,917
- Yeah.

1787
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,976
I was feeling kind of
freaky and I wanted to know

1788
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:06,559
if you would come over
and keep me company?

1789
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:08,384
- Mhmm.

1790
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:18,966
- Hello?

1791
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:21,516
Sammy?

1792
00:59:22,836 --> 00:59:23,669
Hello?

1793
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:27,381
I don't know what happened.

1794
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:28,704
He hung up or something.

1795
00:59:28,704 --> 00:59:29,739
- For real?
- What?

1796
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,701
- Oh, well, we can on our own.

1797
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,576
- For real, we can just go out, girl.

1798
00:59:33,576 --> 00:59:35,360
- Tonight, yes.
- Tonight!

1799
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,469
- Okay, where y'all wanna go?

1800
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:37,302
- Anywhere.
- Anywhere.

1801
00:59:37,302 --> 00:59:38,510
It don't matter.

1802
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,733
- It does not matter.

1803
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:40,566
- Tell me!

1804
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:42,539
- Hey, what's up people?

1805
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:43,372
- [Second B-Boy] What's up?

1806
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:44,205
- All right.

1807
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,038
- [Third B-Boy] What's the deal?

1808
00:59:45,038 --> 00:59:45,871
- Moms just let me in the house.

1809
00:59:45,871 --> 00:59:46,704
- [Third B-Boy] All right.

1810
00:59:46,704 --> 00:59:48,934
- Yeah, hey, Jayski Love gonna
be at the comedy competition.

1811
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,473
You're gonna be there.

1812
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:51,306
- [Third B-Boy] For real?

1813
00:59:51,306 --> 00:59:52,889
- Yeah.

1814
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,549
Where my homeboy, Sammy, at though, man?

1815
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,861
- [Third B-Boy] Oh, he on the phone, man.

1816
00:59:55,861 --> 00:59:56,917
- Can I holler at him, man?

1817
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:57,750
- [Second B-Boy] Yeah.

1818
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,583
- All right.

1819
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:59,519
Hey, yo', Sammy!

1820
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:00,362
- Hey.

1821
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:02,205
- Let's see what we're doing.

1822
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:05,365
(men chatter)

1823
01:00:05,365 --> 01:00:06,783
- He chillin'.

1824
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,616
- Where's he at?

1825
01:00:07,616 --> 01:00:08,575
- Aw man!

1826
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,075
Look at this, son.

1827
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,565
He goin' out like a twister.

1828
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:16,074
- Look at Sammy laying
down like a spoiled sardine

1829
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:17,333
fresh out the can.

1830
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,541
- Man, look at this, man.

1831
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:20,810
- He just fall asleep on the bed.

1832
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,143
- He left the game bag.

1833
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,976
- Damn.

1834
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:24,970
- What a back alley fool, man.

1835
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,133
- What's up with him, man?

1836
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:27,167
- Jesus.

1837
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:28,766
- Man, I give up, dude.

1838
01:00:28,766 --> 01:00:29,674
I give up.

1839
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:30,507
(phone rings)

1840
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:31,340
- Man, get off my phone, man.

1841
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,173
- I'll take it.

1842
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:33,439
- Can you believe it?

1843
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:36,420
Missing out on an opportunity like that?

1844
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,255
(Kendal sighs)

1845
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:40,548
And, they say that drugs
are a great aphrodisiac!

1846
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:43,215
Well, people, you figure it out.

1847
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,959
- Excuse me, how are you?

1848
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:51,975
- [Partner] Victoria, Victoria!

1849
01:00:51,975 --> 01:00:53,575
- I hate it when that happens.

1850
01:00:53,575 --> 01:00:57,959
I speak and get no reply. (scoffs)

1851
01:00:57,959 --> 01:00:59,260
she probably has guys
coming for her all the time.

1852
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:03,985
That's why she doesn't have any
time for a nice guy like me.

1853
01:01:03,985 --> 01:01:08,039
(sighs) She is beautiful though.

1854
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:12,839
That's, I think, what we'll
do for our next character:

1855
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:14,756
the irresistible bitch.

1856
01:01:16,711 --> 01:01:18,203
Well, let's get busy.

1857
01:01:18,203 --> 01:01:19,815
- I believe in you.

1858
01:01:19,815 --> 01:01:20,648
- I want to make sure this is right,

1859
01:01:20,648 --> 01:01:24,898
so sometime of the weekend,
can you pass over this?

1860
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:28,092
- I promise, I won't lead you astray.

1861
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:29,297
I'm in this with you all the way.

1862
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:32,264
I didn't make it to where I am
by trying to act cute, okay?

1863
01:01:32,264 --> 01:01:34,844
I made it to where I am today
because of my persistence

1864
01:01:34,844 --> 01:01:36,956
and my knowledge for marketing.

1865
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:38,385
I believe in you and I'm sure that

1866
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:40,678
once the school receives my
letter of recommendation,

1867
01:01:40,678 --> 01:01:41,988
you'll be just fine,

1868
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:43,388
but you must promise me one thing.

1869
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:44,625
- Sure, anything.

1870
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,951
- That you let this be the
least of your problems.

1871
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:48,252
- Thanks, Victoria.

1872
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:50,545
I hope that someday I'll be
as successful as you are.

1873
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:51,378
- You will be.

1874
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:52,391
Take care of yourself.

1875
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:53,224
- Okay.

1876
01:01:53,224 --> 01:01:55,807
- [Victoria] Enjoy the weekend!

1877
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:03,537
- Hey, hey, hey, sweetheart, sweetheart.

1878
01:02:03,537 --> 01:02:05,008
Hey, hey, what's up?

1879
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:07,727
Hey, you know, I'll do
anything to get to know you.

1880
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:10,407
I'll lick the paint off your toes, girl.

1881
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:13,742
I'll even drink your dirty bathwater.

1882
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:15,575
I'm dying to meet you.

1883
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:19,804
Here's my card.

1884
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,425
Give me a call.

1885
01:02:21,425 --> 01:02:24,028
My name is James, James Bond.

1886
01:02:24,028 --> 01:02:25,831
I already know who you are.

1887
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:29,476
You're Victoria, Victoria Darling.

1888
01:02:29,476 --> 01:02:31,687
I've checked your background.

1889
01:02:31,687 --> 01:02:34,437
Now, let's talk about your future.

1890
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:37,095
- You've done your homework.

1891
01:02:37,095 --> 01:02:40,251
- Yeah, well, forget you too.

1892
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:44,251
Mind, body and soul, I'm
going to have you, gal.

1893
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,593
They like a big mind, god damn.

1894
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:51,281
I'm all in.

1895
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:53,881
Fine though!

1896
01:03:00,081 --> 01:03:02,998
(slow music plays)

1897
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:23,676
- Yeah, Sandy, I know.

1898
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:25,223
Mhmm.

1899
01:03:25,223 --> 01:03:27,740
Well, I probably won't make
it to the comedy competition,

1900
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,151
but I will be there this
evening, definitely.

1901
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:32,016
Yeah, I feel like I need some friends.

1902
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:32,849
Yeah.

1903
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:34,876
Okay, so I'll see you then.

1904
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:35,709
Okay.

1905
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:40,001
Okay, bye-bye.

1906
01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:46,080
(slow music plays)

1907
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:24,135
No Anthony, I'm sorry, but I
can't see you this evening.

1908
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:26,375
It's ladies night out which
means that I'm too committed

1909
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:29,645
to having fun on my own
with my girlfriends.

1910
01:04:29,645 --> 01:04:30,812
- That's cold.

1911
01:04:32,017 --> 01:04:36,092
I was looking forward to
eating you out this evening

1912
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:39,985
and finishing up with a slow, long grind.

1913
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:41,540
- This evening, you're just
going to have to beat your meat

1914
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,975
because that's the closest
you'll get to having me.

1915
01:04:43,975 --> 01:04:45,225
I gotta go now.

1916
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:52,279
- That bitch!

1917
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:56,507
I ain't gonna take that no more.

1918
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:58,407
I always say that.

1919
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:00,990
That shit just too good though.

1920
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:03,567
Ah!

1921
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:04,400
Yes!

1922
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:10,663
(Victoria sighs)

1923
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:13,541
- I wonder what tonight
has in store for me.

1924
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:17,041
I haven't been out to
party in a long time.

1925
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:20,455
I'm looking forward to it, dammit.

1926
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:23,153
I'm going to have some fun.

1927
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:26,236
(swanky music plays)

1928
01:05:44,135 --> 01:05:45,552
- [Bouncer] Hold up,
man, hold up, hold up.

1929
01:05:45,552 --> 01:05:46,385
- What's up, dude?

1930
01:05:46,385 --> 01:05:47,271
- You guys are dressed inappropriate, man.

1931
01:05:47,271 --> 01:05:48,104
I'm sorry.

1932
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:49,809
You brothers can't come in the club.

1933
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:50,642
- Man, what's up!

1934
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:52,284
- Man, I'm in a comedy
show in there, dude.

1935
01:05:52,284 --> 01:05:54,236
- Sorry, brother, your comedy
routine is funny as hell,

1936
01:05:54,236 --> 01:05:55,580
but you guys are dressed inappropriately.

1937
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,582
You can't come in.

1938

01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:03,527
- We can't even go in the club, man?

1944
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:05,528
We just come to spend a
little money with you.

1945
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,857

2032
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:21,871

01:10:41,249 --> 01:10:42,082
How you doing?

2116
01:10:42,082 --> 01:10:44,393
Hey, can me and my buddy
buy you ladies a drink?

2117
01:10:44,393 --> 01:10:45,450
- No thank you.

2118
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,881
- Why not? We not good enough for y'all?

2119
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:51,073
- Did you hear I'm here
with my friend tonight?

2120
01:10:51,073 --> 01:10:55,980
Okay, if we want a drink,
we'll get it ourselves.

2121
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,537
Plus, you know, if you bought us a drink,

2122
01:10:57,537 --> 01:11:01,341
you might feel like
obligated to do something.

2123
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,518
Let me save us both the trouble.

2124
01:11:02,518 --> 01:11:04,417
We're not interested.

2125
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:05,942
- Damn, baby.

2126
01:11:05,942 --> 01:11:07,030
I just wanted to buy you a drink.

2127
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,812
I ain't asking for that whole speech.

2128
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:10,401
Man, but since you got
an attitude about it--

2129
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:11,359
- Come on, Sal, man.

2130
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,277
- [Friend] Yeah, shut your mouth.

2131
01:11:12,277 --> 01:11:13,110
- It isn't worth it, man.

2132
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,943
Chill out, man.

2133
01:11:13,943 --> 01:11:14,783
It ain't even worth that, man.

2134
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:16,310
- I'm cool, man, I'm cool.

2135
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,825
Sorry, ladies.

2136
01:11:17,825 --> 01:11:19,156
- Ignorance.

2137
01:11:19,156 --> 01:11:20,609
You know, that's why I
don't even like going out.

2138
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,412
It's too many ego trips for these men.

2139
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:24,044
- Well, Victoria, you know me and I always

2140
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:26,755
breaking their necks to speak to me.

2141
01:11:26,755 --> 01:11:28,417
- Hey, man, check this out, man.

2142
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,550
You see them two sisters over there, man?

2143
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,469
Man, ever since they come in here tonight,

2144
01:11:32,469 --> 01:11:33,793
I've seen three brothers
step over to their table

2145
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:35,221
and get rejected, man.

2146
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:36,054
- [Man's Friend] Yeah.

2147
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:36,887
- Well, how you gonna tell honey

2148
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:37,932
to get the leg up on us?

2149
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:39,583
- I have three reasons, man.

2150
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,196
One, them brothers not me.

2151
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:43,734
Two, I never seen these
women before in my life.

2152
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:45,281
Dude, I got nothing to lose.

2153
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:46,870
Let me be persistent all day.

2154
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:47,916
- [Black Shirted Man] All right.

2155
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:49,452
- Yeah, man, you know, we only live once.

2156
01:11:49,452 --> 01:11:50,380
Who knows which one of us might come

2157
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,904
into some fineness tonight.

2158
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:53,301
- Me too, man.

2159
01:11:53,301 --> 01:11:54,305
- Here we go again.

2160
01:11:54,305 --> 01:11:55,138
- What?

2161
01:11:55,138 --> 01:11:57,835
- Don't look now, but
there's three suave men

2162
01:11:57,835 --> 01:11:59,297
sitting over to the right of us

2163
01:11:59,297 --> 01:12:01,142
and they are staring us down.

2164
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:02,924
Let's invite 'em over.

2165
01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:04,598
- No, they look too naive, no.

2166
01:12:04,598 --> 01:12:08,316
- Those are the best ones to train.

2167
01:12:08,316 --> 01:12:10,934
- I don't know (crowd drowns out speech).

2168
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:12,310
- She might be, man, so?

2169
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,505
- Man, I hate myself.

2170
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:16,408
Brother, I can say nothing to her.

2171
01:12:16,408 --> 01:12:17,241
I see her peepin', man.

2172
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:18,074
I'm out.

2173
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:19,491
- All right, man.

2174
01:12:24,385 --> 01:12:26,273
- [Third Man] Why, hello.

2175
01:12:26,273 --> 01:12:28,218
- Hello, have a seat.

2176
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,051
- Thank you.

2177
01:12:29,051 --> 01:12:30,358
- What's your name?

2178
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:31,478
- My name is Jason.

2179
01:12:31,478 --> 01:12:33,793
- Man, I can't let that man
go over there by himself, man.

2180
01:12:33,793 --> 01:12:34,881
- I know what you're saying.

2181
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:35,830
- Oh man!

2182
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,558
Man, you got some shit
dripping out your nose anyway!

2183
01:12:37,558 --> 01:12:39,614
You ain't gonna get no game.

2184
01:12:39,614 --> 01:12:41,752
(friend laughs)

2185
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:43,937
- I'm Victoria and this
is my friend Sandy.

2186
01:12:43,937 --> 01:12:44,770
- Hi.

2187
01:12:46,645 --> 01:12:48,726
- This is my friend Alan.

2188
01:12:48,726 --> 01:12:50,454
Alan, this is Victoria, this is Sandy.

2189
01:12:50,454 --> 01:12:51,287
- Hello.

2190
01:12:51,287 --> 01:12:53,164
- I hope my staring isn't embarrassing.

2191
01:12:53,164 --> 01:12:54,166
- Oh no.

2192
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,393
It happens to us a lot.

2193
01:12:55,393 --> 01:12:57,612
So, what can I do for you?

2194
01:12:57,612 --> 01:12:58,445
- Well,

2195
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:01,729
would you like to dance?

2196
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:06,729
- No, but would you like to
come home with me tonight?

2197
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:07,714
- Why yes!

2198
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,166
Definitely!

2199
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,030
When?

2200
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,863
- Now.

2201
01:13:13,153 --> 01:13:14,250
I'll see you later, Sandy.

2202
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,423
- My guy!

2203
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:18,006
- Okay, girlfriend, be careful.

2204
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:26,129
- So, what's your sign?

2205
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:26,962
- Scorpio.

2206
01:13:26,962 --> 01:13:27,795
- Scorpio.

2207
01:13:29,809 --> 01:13:31,638
Do you come here often?

2208
01:13:31,638 --> 01:13:32,471
- Yeah.

2209
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:35,681
- Do you have a man?

2210
01:13:35,681 --> 01:13:36,630
- Why?

2211
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:37,665
- I'd just like to know.

2212
01:13:37,665 --> 01:13:39,020
I'd like to be your
friend, get to know you.

2213
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,236
- I do have a man.

2214
01:13:40,236 --> 01:13:41,069
- You have a man?

2215
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:41,902
- Yes.

2216
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:42,735
- As far as you know,
where is he right now?

2217
01:13:42,735 --> 01:13:43,873
- I can't remember the
last time that I had

2218
01:13:43,873 --> 01:13:45,260
such a positive conversation

2219
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,425
with a more attractive
young lady than yourself.

2220
01:13:47,425 --> 01:13:48,268
- Well, thank you.

2221
01:13:48,268 --> 01:13:49,580
- What's your name?

2222
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,794
- My name is Daysia.

2223
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,117
- Daysia, I'm Shylo

2224
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:52,950
- Shylo?

2225
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:53,783
- Yes.

2226
01:13:53,783 --> 01:13:55,380
- You wouldn't happen to
be the Shylo that donated

2227
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,057
uniforms to the East Oakland
Youth Development Center,

2228
01:13:58,057 --> 01:13:58,890
would you?

2229
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,596
- Sounds like word travels fast to me.

2230
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:02,110
- My brother, he plays for that team.

2231
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,156
- Hey, really?

2232
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:04,156
That's good.

2233
01:14:05,236 --> 01:14:07,871
So, I hope you said a lot
of good things about me.

2234
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:10,132
- Well, that's for me to
know and you to find out.

2235
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:12,329
- Oh, sounds like a challenge to me!

2236
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:13,278
- Maybe.

2237
01:14:13,278 --> 01:14:14,695
- Here's my card.

2238
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,918
When you get some free time,
why don't you give me a call,

2239
01:14:17,918 --> 01:14:20,788
maybe have lunch or dinner,
perhaps a movie even.

2240
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:21,684
- I'd like that.

2241
01:14:21,684 --> 01:14:23,145
- Okay.

2242
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:24,233
Give me a call any time.

2243
01:14:24,233 --> 01:14:25,993
I'll be there for you 24 hours a day.

2244
01:14:25,993 --> 01:14:27,775
- It was nice to meet you, Shylo.

2245
01:14:27,775 --> 01:14:29,385
- Same with you.

2246
01:14:29,385 --> 01:14:30,503
You be sweet now, okay?

2247
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:32,040
- Girl, where'd you get that jacket from?

2248
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,151
- Girl, do you like it?

2249
01:14:33,151 --> 01:14:33,984
One of my mans sent it to me.

2250
01:14:33,984 --> 01:14:34,817
- Okay.

2251
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:35,881
Hey, hey.

2252
01:14:35,881 --> 01:14:37,364
See that guy trying to get at me?

2253
01:14:37,364 --> 01:14:38,197
- Yes, I did, okay.

2254
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:40,191
- Why was his breath stinking?

2255
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:41,024
- It was?

2256
01:14:41,024 --> 01:14:42,356
(girls laugh)

2257
01:14:42,356 --> 01:14:44,287
- And girl, (tsks) his suit was ancient!

2258
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:45,267
- Real ancient!

2259
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:46,399
- And those shoes, uh-huh.

2260
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,538
They ain't never coming out like that.

2261
01:14:47,538 --> 01:14:48,371
- Okay!

2262
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:51,877
- Say, how you young ladies doing?

2263
01:14:51,877 --> 01:14:52,710
- Fine.

2264
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:54,025
- You're looking so lovely and beautiful.

2265
01:14:54,025 --> 01:14:55,124
- [Both] Thank you.

2266
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:56,477
- Hey, you know something?

2267
01:14:56,477 --> 01:14:58,478
I'm the comedian director here.

2268
01:14:58,478 --> 01:14:59,311
- Are you?

2269
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:01,588
- Yeah, and I need some
hosts for the show.

2270
01:15:01,588 --> 01:15:02,996
Would you be interested?

2271
01:15:02,996 --> 01:15:04,114
- [Both] Is that right?

2272
01:15:04,114 --> 01:15:05,629
- I'm, my name's Roger.

2273
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:07,399
Here's my card.

2274
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:09,055
Give me a call.

2275
01:15:09,055 --> 01:15:10,367
- [Both] We could reach
you at this number?

2276
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:12,392
- Yes, you can reach me at that number.

2277
01:15:12,392 --> 01:15:14,367
If I can squeeze by you?

2278
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:15,732
- [Both] Oh sure.

2279
01:15:15,732 --> 01:15:16,565
- Give me a call.

2280
01:15:16,565 --> 01:15:17,398
- Right.

2281
01:15:17,398 --> 01:15:18,356
Okay.

2282
01:15:18,356 --> 01:15:19,844
- Girl, I ain't calling him.

2283
01:15:19,844 --> 01:15:22,927
(swanky music plays)

2284
01:16:10,804 --> 01:16:12,479
(crowd chatters)

2285
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:14,345
- Man, little ass trying to sneak in here.

2286
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:16,595
Now, who's my friend slick?

2287
01:16:18,982 --> 01:16:21,899
(slow music plays)

2288
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:33,826
- So,

2289
01:16:33,826 --> 01:16:36,564
have you ever been with
a real woman before?

2290
01:16:36,564 --> 01:16:38,217
- Well,

2291
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:39,050
no.

2292
01:16:44,191 --> 01:16:45,460
- Stop.

2293
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,017
Stop!

2294
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:48,916
That kind of stuff only
happens in the movies

2295
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:50,738
or in The Twilight Zone somewhere.

2296
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:54,071
It never, ever happens to a guy like me.

2297
01:16:55,926 --> 01:16:56,759
- Interesting.

2298
01:16:56,759 --> 01:16:59,348
I see a very articulate,
well-dressed brother

2299
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,503
that it's obvious that he has
a great deal of self-esteem

2300
01:17:01,503 --> 01:17:04,520
and is well-respected by
the people he talks too.

2301
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,865
He also seems like a brother

2302
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:08,276
who has not forgotten his roots.

2303
01:17:08,276 --> 01:17:10,359
Let's kick it right here.

2304
01:17:12,959 --> 01:17:13,792
- [Pam] Shylo?

2305
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:14,625
- Pam!

2306
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:15,458
Aw, shit!

2307
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:16,291
- [Pam] How you doin', what's up?

2308
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,449
- Come here and give me a hug, girl.

2309
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:18,282
How you been?

2310
01:17:18,282 --> 01:17:19,115
- What you up to?

2311
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:19,948
- Oh, just handling.

2312
01:17:19,948 --> 01:17:20,911
- I'm doing good.

2313
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:22,014
Look at you.

2314
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:22,847
Big time investor!

2315
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,020
I don't believe it.

2316
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,972
I never thought you'd amount to anything.

2317
01:17:25,972 --> 01:17:27,423
- [Shylo] Shows you what you know!

2318
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,745
- Guess I don't know nothing!

2319
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:30,953
(Shylo laughs)

2320
01:17:30,953 --> 01:17:32,916
Boy, I thought you'd still
be running around here

2321
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,143
acting like an idiot.

2322
01:17:34,143 --> 01:17:34,976
- Go on with that.

2323
01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:35,809
- Just like when we were kids.

2324
01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:36,642
- Get out of here.

2325
01:17:36,642 --> 01:17:37,475
- This dude used to really piss me off.

2326
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:38,554
- Get out of here.

2327
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:40,415
- (sighs) You remember that
time we snuck out the house

2328
01:17:40,415 --> 01:17:41,843
and went to a Nicks party?

2329
01:17:41,843 --> 01:17:42,953
- Around the corner!

2330
01:17:42,953 --> 01:17:43,871
- [Pam] Yeah, yeah!

2331
01:17:43,871 --> 01:17:45,588
- Oh, it was popping the most that night.

2332
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:46,421
- [Pam] Wasn't it though?

2333
01:17:46,421 --> 01:17:47,254
- Yeah, it was.

2334
01:17:47,254 --> 01:17:49,337
- And look at you now!

2335
01:17:49,337 --> 01:17:50,170
I'm proud of you.

2336
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,391
- Am I looking good or what?

2337
01:17:51,391 --> 01:17:52,224
- Well, hello, Shylo!

2338
01:17:52,224 --> 01:17:53,057
- Oh, excuse me.

2339
01:17:53,057 --> 01:17:53,890
- So nice to finally meet you.

2340
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:54,723
- Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

2341
01:17:54,723 --> 01:17:55,556
- I'm Susie.

2342
01:17:55,556 --> 01:17:56,389
- Uh-huh.

2343
01:17:56,389 --> 01:17:58,089
- I've been wanting to meet
you for a long time now.

2344
01:17:58,089 --> 01:17:59,263
- [Shylo] Oh.

2345
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:01,288
- I've admired what you've
done for the community.

2346
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:02,121
- [Shylo] Thank you.

2347
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:04,520
- You're one of the best music
managers in the business.

2348
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,593
You know, I've been trying to
get into the business myself

2349
01:18:07,593 --> 01:18:11,145
but I've been having a difficult time.

2350
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:15,409
Do you think maybe you and I
could possibly work together?

2351
01:18:15,409 --> 01:18:18,242
Here, why don't you take my number

2352
01:18:19,148 --> 01:18:21,236
and give me a call.

2353
01:18:21,236 --> 01:18:22,729
- Okay.

2354
01:18:22,729 --> 01:18:23,666
Massan!

2355
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:24,499
- Shylo!

2356
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:25,332
- How you doing, my man?

2357
01:18:25,332 --> 01:18:26,165
- I'm all right.

2358
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:26,998
- You still playing ball?

2359
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:28,393
- Nah, man, I'm furthering
my education, man.

2360
01:18:28,393 --> 01:18:29,929
- [Shylo] Hey, that comes first.

2361
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:30,762
- Yeah.

2362
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:31,595
- [Shylo] Yeah.

2363
01:18:31,595 --> 01:18:32,428
- I just wanted to tell you thank you

2364
01:18:32,428 --> 01:18:33,261
because you're an inspiration to me.

2365
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:35,231
- Hey man, it's just one brother
helping another, you know?

2366
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:36,447
- [Massan] That's right.

2367
01:18:36,447 --> 01:18:38,219
- We got to help each other around here.

2368
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:39,817
Positive.

2369
01:18:39,817 --> 01:18:41,833
Listen here, y'all, I hate to sound rude

2370
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,167
but I have a couple of acts performing

2371
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:44,851
down at the Vintage Inn tonight.

2372
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:45,684
- Oh!

2373
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:46,517
- You guys know where that is, right?

2374
01:18:46,517 --> 01:18:47,350
- Yeah.
- Sure.

2375
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:48,183
- Okay, well, look, if you get a chance,

2376
01:18:48,183 --> 01:18:49,439
stop on by and I might even have

2377
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:51,316
some passes for you at
the front door, okay?

2378
01:18:51,316 --> 01:18:52,149
- Good.

2379
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:52,982
- Y'all be safe now, you hear?

2380
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:53,815
- Okay, see you, Shylo.

2381
01:18:53,815 --> 01:18:54,648
- Call me!

2382
01:18:54,648 --> 01:18:55,731
- Sure thing!

2383
01:19:07,017 --> 01:19:07,850
- You gonna be all right?

2384
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:08,683
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

2385
01:19:08,683 --> 01:19:09,650
- Okay, you got some money now?

2386
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,263
- Yeah, I have plenty.

2387
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:12,446
- Okay, don't get in no trouble now.

2388
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:13,279
- I know, I'll be good.

2389
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:15,497
- You know it's rough out
there in the whole thing.

2390
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:16,844
If something comes up, you give me a call.

2391
01:19:16,844 --> 01:19:17,919
- Okay, as soon as I get in.

2392
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,002
- Okay, do that now because

2393
01:19:19,002 --> 01:19:21,320
so many things been happening out here,

2394
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,049
and I don't want to be worrying about you.

2395
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:23,882
- I'll be careful.

2396
01:19:23,882 --> 01:19:24,715
- Please do!

2397
01:19:24,715 --> 01:19:25,548
- I will.

2398
01:19:25,548 --> 01:19:26,381
- Okay, now you heard
about that other girl

2399
01:19:26,381 --> 01:19:28,468
that got, they messed her around

2400
01:19:28,468 --> 01:19:30,068
and the homegirl still hasn't recovered.

2401
01:19:30,068 --> 01:19:31,401
- Is that right?

2402
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:35,829
Well, I'll be careful.

2403
01:19:40,436 --> 01:19:41,269
I'll call you as soon as I get in.

2404
01:19:41,269 --> 01:19:42,352
- Okay, okay.

2405
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:45,813
Right on.

2406
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:47,488
Hey, hey, hey!

2407
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:48,553
- [Unique] Hey, Soldier, how you doing?

2408
01:19:48,553 --> 01:19:49,479
- Unique, what's happening?

2409
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:50,793
- I'm hanging in here, you
know, but how you been?

2410
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:51,881
- I've been doing pretty good.

2411
01:19:51,881 --> 01:19:52,714
How's the foot?

2412
01:19:52,714 --> 01:19:54,921
- Aw man, the doctor got my toe broken.

2413
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:56,504
- Is that right?

2414
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:58,292
Man, you boys did a
hell of a job on my car.

2415
01:19:58,292 --> 01:19:59,802
- I see that, it looks good.

2416
01:19:59,802 --> 01:20:00,895
- Yeah, man.

2417
01:20:00,895 --> 01:20:01,728
- It looks good, the whole's good.

2418
01:20:01,728 --> 01:20:03,151
- You boys know what they doing!

2419
01:20:03,151 --> 01:20:03,984
- I like those stripes on--

2420
01:20:03,984 --> 01:20:04,817
- Dad, I'm getting ready to go.

2421
01:20:04,817 --> 01:20:05,998
- Okay, sweetheart.

2422
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:07,086
Look here, this is a good friend of mine.

2423
01:20:07,086 --> 01:20:08,151
This is Shylo.

2424
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:09,144
This is my daughter, Selena.

2425
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:10,510
- Nice to meet you.

2426
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,598
- It's definitely a pleasure.

2427
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,016
- Okay, take care and bye, Daddy.

2428
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:13,934
- Okay, take care of yourself now.

2429
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:14,767
- Okay.

2430
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:16,850
- [Father] All right now.

2431
01:20:21,298 --> 01:20:22,315
- Shoot, I couldn't believe it, man.

2432
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:23,148
It really looks good.

2433
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:23,981
- I like that.

2434
01:20:23,981 --> 01:20:24,814
How you like those stripes?

2435
01:20:24,814 --> 01:20:26,051
- Oh man, those stripes,
they're wonderful.

2436
01:20:26,051 --> 01:20:27,126
Man, your boys know what they was doing.

2437
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:29,208
- Hey, hey, I'm going to

2438
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:30,275
a raise, man, they're fantastic.

01:20:30,275 --> 01:20:31,606
- Yeah, well, look, I'm

2440
01:20:31,606 --> 01:20:32,494
I'm going to bring you some business.

01:20:46,393 --> 01:20:47,288
- We can catch up on some old times, huh?

2453
01:20:47,288 --> 01:20:48,184
- [Father] Yeah, it sounds like a winner.

2454
01:20:48,184 --> 01:20:49,017
- Okay, I'll be back.

2455
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:49,850
- [Father] It sounds like a winner.

2456
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:50,683
Okay.
- All right.

2457
01:20:50,683 --> 01:20:51,516
- [Father] Okay, you hang in there.

2458
01:20:51,516 --> 01:20:52,349
- Definitely, yeah.

2459
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:53,240
But, that daughter of yours...

2460
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,073
- Hey, that's my daughter now.

2461
01:20:54,073 --> 01:20:55,075
(car beeps)
That's my daughter.

2462
01:20:55,075 --> 01:20:55,908
- Bye Daddy!

2463
01:20:55,908 --> 01:20:56,741
- [Father] Okay, baby, take it easy.

2464
01:20:56,741 --> 01:20:57,574
- [Shylo] Yeah.

2465
01:20:57,574 --> 01:20:58,407
- [Father] Take it easy now.

2466
01:20:58,407 --> 01:20:59,240
- All right, Will.

2467
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,073
- Okay.

2468
01:21:00,073 --> 01:21:00,906
- I'm out of here.

2469
01:21:00,906 --> 01:21:01,739
- [Father] Hang in there.

2470
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:02,989
- [Shylo] Yeah.

2471
01:21:05,197 --> 01:21:06,030
- What's up?

2472
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:06,863
All right, so, you watch my daughter, now.

2473
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:08,376
- All right, Will, does she drive fast?

2474
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:09,209
- [Father] Pretty fast!

2475
01:21:09,209 --> 01:21:10,042
(Shylo chuckles)

2476
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:10,875
All right, now.

2477
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:11,708
- All right, peace.

2478
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:12,541
- Okay.

2479
01:21:15,107 --> 01:21:17,440
(car honks)

2480
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:26,349
Well, we need more boys
like that in the community.

2481
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:27,182
Jesus.

2482
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:30,467
(car honks)

2483
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:33,550
(swanky music plays)

2484
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:40,195
(man hollers)

2485
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:41,347
- [Coach] That's right,
bring that defense.

2486
01:21:41,347 --> 01:21:44,180
Let me see them hands and be open.

2487
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:47,399
Take a pass at Chris.

2488
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:48,232
That's it.

2489
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:52,160
Ready or not, it's your chance, get it.

2490
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:52,993
Serve!

2491
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:00,663
(whistle blows)

2492
01:22:00,663 --> 01:22:03,746
Give me the damn ball, give me the ball!

2493
01:22:03,746 --> 01:22:04,675
Over here.

2494
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,092
Give me the ball.

2495
01:22:08,995 --> 01:22:10,017
Defense.

2496
01:22:10,017 --> 01:22:12,248
Y'all should be working
like a dance team out there.

2497
01:22:12,248 --> 01:22:13,603
Help each other out!

2498
01:22:13,603 --> 01:22:15,811
Keep your hands up and your feet moving.

2499
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:19,320
Billy, make sure everybody
touch that ball one time

2500
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,392
before you shoot, you got that?

2501
01:22:21,392 --> 01:22:22,225
And, lighten up on that dribbling.

2502
01:22:22,225 --> 01:22:23,427
You dribbling too much.

2503
01:22:23,427 --> 01:22:26,414
Okay, run it with some authority.

2504
01:22:26,414 --> 01:22:28,414
Keep them passes, Chris!

2505
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,064
Slam it.

2506
01:22:31,064 --> 01:22:33,064
Move that ball, move it.

2507
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:37,262
Defense, keep them hands
up and the feet moving.

2508
01:22:37,262 --> 01:22:38,095
(Shylo laughs)

2509
01:22:38,095 --> 01:22:38,958
Keep them hands...

2510
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:40,398
Move it!

2511
01:22:40,398 --> 01:22:42,414
(coach sighs)

2512
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:43,587
What's wrong, Billy?

2513
01:22:43,587 --> 01:22:44,670
Get it going!

2514
01:22:46,744 --> 01:22:47,577
That's it.

2515
01:22:48,817 --> 01:22:52,133
(Shylo laughs)

2516
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:52,966
Come here, boy!

2517
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:53,799
- How you doing, Coach?

2518
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:55,000
- Shylo!

2519
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,230
- Hey, you done look good, man.

2520
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:58,136
- Hold on a minute.

2521
01:22:58,136 --> 01:22:59,468
Man, what's wrong with you?

2522
01:22:59,468 --> 01:23:01,356
Hey, I'm on the move, you got to move.

2523
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:04,027
Get out there and do it right.

2524
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:05,443
You better bring it right.

2525
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:06,276
And let me see you--

2526
01:23:06,276 --> 01:23:08,760
(muffled shouts)

2527
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,264
Let's go.

2528
01:23:10,264 --> 01:23:12,952
Don't hear a dang bit, man.

2529
01:23:12,952 --> 01:23:14,371
What can I do for you today?

2530
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:15,950
- It's like this,

2531
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:19,128
I want to sponsor shoes and uniforms

2532
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:21,102
for your team this season.

2533
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:23,022
- Well, what brought on all of that?

2534
01:23:23,022 --> 01:23:24,939
- I have so much money,

2535
01:23:25,982 --> 01:23:29,480
I just don't know what
to do with it. (laughs)

2536
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,313
Plus,

2537
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:34,068
remember the back in
the days when I played.

2538
01:23:34,068 --> 01:23:37,208
This white man bought everyone on the team

2539
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:38,542
swing pro gear.

2540
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:39,683
- Oh, Miles' kid.

2541
01:23:39,683 --> 01:23:40,516
- You remember.

2542
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:41,349
- Yeah!

2543
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,580
- We all thought we
were players after that!

2544
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,651
(both laugh)

2545
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:45,987
- Y'all been bustin' great.

2546
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:47,555
- Anyway, I thought I
was a pretty cool thing

2547
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,027
for him to do,

2548
01:23:49,027 --> 01:23:51,747
so I just wanted to try my best, you know,

2549
01:23:51,747 --> 01:23:53,414
give something back.

2550
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:56,568
- Shylo, old boy, it's quite a gift.

2551
01:23:56,568 --> 01:23:57,401
- Hey--

2552
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:58,234
- I won't argue with you.

2553
01:23:58,234 --> 01:23:59,067
- All right.

2554
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,038
- I just thank you!

2555
01:24:01,038 --> 01:24:02,144
Hold on, hold on.

2556
01:24:02,144 --> 01:24:04,003
All right, hold on, don't go nowhere.

2557
01:24:04,003 --> 01:24:05,102
(whistle blows)

2558
01:24:05,102 --> 01:24:06,424
All right, everybody over here.

2559
01:24:06,424 --> 01:24:08,003
Let me see y'all hustle.

2560
01:24:08,003 --> 01:24:09,633
Let me hold that.

2561
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:12,099
Fellas, y'all come on up here.

2562
01:24:12,099 --> 01:24:15,288
This is Shylo and he
brought us some good news.

2563
01:24:15,288 --> 01:24:17,441
He's going to be sponsoring
our team this season

2564
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:21,123
with some brand new
uniforms and tennis shoes.

2565
01:24:21,123 --> 01:24:21,998
Fellas, this is Shylo.

2566
01:24:21,998 --> 01:24:23,982
Shylo, my boys here.

2567
01:24:23,982 --> 01:24:25,944
(boys clap and cheer)

2568
01:24:25,944 --> 01:24:28,430
All right, y'all settle
down, settle down, now.

2569
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,680
Shylo, my boys.

2570
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:33,507
- You guys really deserve this.

2571
01:24:33,507 --> 01:24:37,400
I got to go now, but good
luck with the season.

2572
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,256
I want you all to remember one thing.

2573
01:24:40,256 --> 01:24:42,851
It doesn't matter if you win or you lose,

2574
01:24:42,851 --> 01:24:45,198
but how you play the game.

2575
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:47,596
And, you keep your head up, dude.

2576
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:48,429
- Hold on, man.

2577
01:24:48,429 --> 01:24:49,411
Shylo, don't go nowhere yet.

2578
01:24:49,411 --> 01:24:50,584
All right, Billy.

2579
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:51,907
Now, hold on, Shylo.

2580
01:24:51,907 --> 01:24:53,111
Offense, let me see that offense

2581
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:57,174
and then run it with some
authority like I showed you.

2582
01:24:57,174 --> 01:24:58,414
(whistle blows)

2583
01:24:58,414 --> 01:24:59,758
And, make sure everybody touch that ball

2584
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:01,230
one time before you shoot it.

2585
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,342
Shylo, boy, I don't know
how to thank you, partner.

2586
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:05,122
I'm so grateful.

2587
01:25:05,122 --> 01:25:06,904
All right now, you better watch yourself,

2588
01:25:06,904 --> 01:25:08,120
- Now, be sure, hear?

2589
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:08,953
- Okay.

2590
01:25:08,953 --> 01:25:09,786
- You old goat!

2591
01:25:09,786 --> 01:25:11,630
- Get on out of here, sucker.

2592
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:13,038
Billy, make sure everybody touch that ball

2593
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:16,216
one time before you shoot it!

2594
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:18,115
That's it, that's...

2595
01:25:18,115 --> 01:25:21,198
(swanky music plays)

2596
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:38,830
- This is it right here.

2597
01:25:40,579 --> 01:25:42,912
This is where it all begins.

2598
01:25:54,043 --> 01:25:58,126
- Quit tripping, Happnens,
and throw me the ball.

2599
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:03,604
Come on, Happnens.

2600
01:26:10,819 --> 01:26:12,579
- Ew, there go ugly Shylo.

2601
01:26:12,579 --> 01:26:15,496
What you going to say to him today?

2602
01:26:21,347 --> 01:26:25,059
- Damn, Shylo, you
always scoring touchdown.

2603
01:26:25,059 --> 01:26:26,904
- [Mean Girl] Ew, look at ugly Shylo!

2604
01:26:26,904 --> 01:26:27,992
- I got a girlfriend.

2605
01:26:27,992 --> 01:26:30,584
You ain't nothing but a brick in the wall.

2606
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:32,238
- In the brick in the wall?

2607
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:34,008
Well, you know you like me.

2608
01:26:34,008 --> 01:26:36,718
I'll always be the star of your dreams.

2609
01:26:36,718 --> 01:26:37,944
- Shut up, Lizard Woman.

2610
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:40,643
You'll never be the star of my dreams.

2611
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:44,643
- Baby, if you had dreams,
trust me, I would be in them.

2612
01:26:44,643 --> 01:26:46,275
- [All Three] You little momma's boy.

2613
01:26:46,275 --> 01:26:47,427
- [Shylo] If I hear you say that again,

2614
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:49,006
I'll whip the black off of you.

2615
01:26:49,006 --> 01:26:50,187
- [Mean Girl] Why don't you
say that a little louder,

2616
01:26:50,187 --> 01:26:51,830
Shylo, so your mother can hear you

2617
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:55,299
because you got a real filthy mouth.

2618
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:57,111
- Boy, you better watch your mouth.

2619
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,894
You don't talk to little ladies like that.

2620
01:26:58,894 --> 01:26:59,832
Now, the next time you say something,

2621
01:26:59,832 --> 01:27:01,752
you're coming in this house, you hear me?

2622
01:27:01,752 --> 01:27:04,334
- [Shylo] Yes, ma'am.

2623
01:27:04,334 --> 01:27:05,998
- Haha, Shylo!

2624
01:27:05,998 --> 01:27:08,012
(Mean Girl giggles)

2625
01:27:08,012 --> 01:27:10,512
(boys groans)

2626
01:27:24,686 --> 01:27:27,769
(swanky music plays)

2627
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:52,598
♪ Yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪

2628
01:27:55,977 --> 01:28:00,727
♪ Yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪

2629
01:28:25,197 --> 01:28:27,960
- Dang, it's dark already.

2630
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,960
I got to plan some shit.

2631
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,635
(machine beeps)

2632
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:35,576
- [Woman] Hi, honey, it's me--

2633
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:36,409
- Baby.

2634
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:38,200
- [Woman] I guess I'll
call you later, okay?

2635
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,033
Love you, bye-bye.

2636
01:28:39,033 --> 01:28:40,283
- Love you too.

2637
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:42,360
- [JR] Hey, homie, what's
going on with that hoe?

2638
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,193
- Hey.

2639
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:44,026
- [JR] It's JR.

2640
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:44,859
You ready to get live?

2641
01:28:44,859 --> 01:28:46,942
Give JR the call, please.

2642
01:28:50,317 --> 01:28:52,453
(machine beeps)

2643
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:54,936
- [Mother] Hello, son, this
is your mother calling.

2644
01:28:54,936 --> 01:28:55,769
- Hi mom.

2645
01:28:55,769 --> 01:28:57,774
- [Mother] Why don't you
ever come visit anymore?

2646
01:28:57,774 --> 01:28:58,723
Are you eating right?

2647
01:28:58,723 --> 01:28:59,800
- Yeah.

2648
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,814
- [Mother] Call me.

2649
01:29:00,814 --> 01:29:01,688
- Okay.

2650
01:29:01,688 --> 01:29:02,521
- [Mother] I love you, son.

2651
01:29:02,521 --> 01:29:03,926
- I love you, Ma.

2652
01:29:03,926 --> 01:29:05,509
That's my mom, boy.

2653
01:29:07,374 --> 01:29:09,560
- [Ryan] Hey Shylo, this is Ryan.

2654
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,734
The business deal came through!

2655
01:29:10,734 --> 01:29:11,567
(Shylo cheers)

2656
01:29:11,567 --> 01:29:12,888
Business, man!

2657
01:29:12,888 --> 01:29:13,721
- Yes!

2658
01:29:13,721 --> 01:29:14,554
- [Ryan] I just told Walter and Cam.

2659
01:29:14,554 --> 01:29:15,387
- We really know.

2660
01:29:15,387 --> 01:29:16,220
- [Ryan] Me and the boys will be down

2661
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,731
at the Vintage Inn celebrating.

2662
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:18,658
- Cool.

2663
01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:20,686
- [Ryan] Come on down and
slam some brewskis with us.

2664
01:29:20,686 --> 01:29:23,064
If you can't, if you can't make it,

2665
01:29:23,064 --> 01:29:24,919
I'll see you bright and
early Monday morning.

2666
01:29:24,919 --> 01:29:25,752
- Cool.

2667
01:29:25,752 --> 01:29:26,585
- [Ryan] Peace.

2668
01:29:26,585 --> 01:29:27,418
- Peace!

2669
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:32,753
Shylo's come a long ways.

2670
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:36,908
You should be proud of yourself, man.

2671
01:29:37,912 --> 01:29:40,172
Just think, back in the days,

2672
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,839
all I used to do was reek havoc.

2673
01:29:43,928 --> 01:29:46,199
I must admit that playing by the rules

2674
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:48,728
is a lot more rewarding.

2675
01:29:48,728 --> 01:29:51,228
I love you, my brother, peace.

2676
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:54,631
(phone rings)

2677
01:29:57,637 --> 01:29:59,288
Hello, Shylo.

2678
01:29:59,288 --> 01:30:00,321
- Hello.

2679
01:30:00,321 --> 01:30:01,571
Hello, darling.

2680
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:03,951
How are you?

2681
01:30:05,582 --> 01:30:09,208
Are we still compatible or did
you drop me for someone else?

2682
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:12,344
- Fahte, you know you're
my favorite person

2683
01:30:12,344 --> 01:30:13,677
and personality.

2684
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:19,329
I guess you have the right to jam me up.

2685
01:30:19,329 --> 01:30:20,792
I'll tell you what...

2686
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:21,625
- Okay.

2687
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:25,230
That sounds sweet to me.

2688
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:26,480
Should I drive?

2689
01:30:28,685 --> 01:30:30,936
Okay, I'll be ready and waiting.

2690
01:30:30,936 --> 01:30:32,353
See ya', bye-bye.

2691
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,703
(Shylo laughs)

2692
01:30:42,711 --> 01:30:43,544
- Boy.

2693
01:30:44,632 --> 01:30:47,132
I must admit that working hard

2694
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:51,106
definitely does pay off in the end.

2695
01:30:57,648 --> 01:31:00,315
(Shylo exhales)

2696
01:31:03,214 --> 01:31:04,867
- [Bill] You know, I think
that girl, Victoria, liked me!

2697
01:31:04,867 --> 01:31:06,190
- [Kendal] (laughs) Get out of here!

2698
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:07,023
- [Bill] She did!

2699
01:31:07,023 --> 01:31:07,856
You didn't see her eyes, dude.

2700
01:31:07,856 --> 01:31:08,689
- [Kendal] Oh, man, get out of here.

2701
01:31:08,689 --> 01:31:09,731
I seen them eyes.

2702
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:11,171
She probably had a boyfriend.

2703
01:31:11,171 --> 01:31:12,355
- Eyes for me, that is.

2704
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:13,475
- Aw!

2705
01:31:13,475 --> 01:31:14,638
Well, what are you gonna do tonight?

2706
01:31:14,638 --> 01:31:15,971
- Oh man, I'm meeting my girl tonight.

2707
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:16,804
I'm sorry.

2708
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:17,637
- Are you sure?

2709
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:19,363
We could catch some
checkers or something else.

2710
01:31:19,363 --> 01:31:20,268
- Yeah, but I've been waiting for my girl

2711
01:31:20,268 --> 01:31:21,101
for the longest, man.

2712
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:21,934
- All right, I think I'm going to go

2713
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:22,767
to work on our paper.

2714
01:31:22,767 --> 01:31:23,600
- Cool.

2715
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,569
(men shout)

2716
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:28,376
- Virus, she's waiting for the mailman.

2717
01:31:28,376 --> 01:31:31,139
She want some dope, so
she beat a dope man.

2718
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:33,006
He knows he's hooked, he's sprung on crack

2719
01:31:33,006 --> 01:31:34,243
and you can tell the way her boobs--

2720
01:31:34,243 --> 01:31:35,384
- Shut up!

2721
01:31:35,384 --> 01:31:36,217
Shut up!

2722
01:31:36,217 --> 01:31:37,336
Shut up!

2723
01:31:37,336 --> 01:31:38,169
Shut up!

2724
01:31:38,169 --> 01:31:43,169
(men chatter)
(woman hyperventilates)

2725
01:31:47,138 --> 01:31:48,034
- Now, there's a guy who could

2726
01:31:48,034 --> 01:31:49,731
give us character analyzation.

2727
01:31:49,731 --> 01:31:51,150
- We don't have enough time
to do anything with that one.

2728
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:52,494
- But, I've got my pocket recorder here--

2729
01:31:52,494 --> 01:31:54,060
- [Kendal] You'd need a whole
book to tell that story.

2730
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:55,779
Besides, we out of time.

2731
01:31:55,779 --> 01:31:58,696
(bus crowd shouts)

2732
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:10,519
- I'm goin' downtown, baby.

2733
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:17,731
Kendal, it's your turn.

2734
01:32:17,731 --> 01:32:19,139
What's wrong with you?

2735
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:19,972
- Naw.

2736
01:32:19,972 --> 01:32:21,560
- You know, ever since you
got back from your outing,

2737
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,128
you've been all polite and considerate.

2738
01:32:23,128 --> 01:32:24,908
What's going on?

2739
01:32:24,908 --> 01:32:26,979
- Baby, it ain't nothing.

2740
01:32:26,979 --> 01:32:30,254
I'm just going through a little
bit of a character change.

2741
01:32:30,254 --> 01:32:31,087
Money!

2742
01:32:32,888 --> 01:32:34,471
Cool, you see that?

2743
01:32:35,734 --> 01:32:38,651
(slow music plays)

2744
01:32:56,163 --> 01:32:57,571
- [Bill On Recorder]
On this particular day,

2745
01:32:57,571 --> 01:32:59,630
Kendal and I had the opportunity to study

2746
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:01,528
a small sampling of people.

2747
01:33:01,528 --> 01:33:04,248
We've chosen to call them characters.

2748
01:33:04,248 --> 01:33:06,211
The perverse please of
studying these people

2749
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:08,664
in a variety of situations, their actions

2750
01:33:08,664 --> 01:33:10,680
and sometimes even their thoughts,

2751
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,067
has brought us to the conclusion

2752
01:33:12,067 --> 01:33:15,246
that everyone is definitely
in a world of their own.

2753
01:33:15,246 --> 01:33:17,581
As people, we must look
inside of ourselves

2754
01:33:17,581 --> 01:33:19,159
before we can begin to understand

2755
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:21,806
or pass judgment on others.

2756
01:33:21,806 --> 01:33:24,462
We hope our paper is providing
you with some insight.

2757
01:33:24,462 --> 01:33:26,766
We are all brothers and sisters,

2758
01:33:26,766 --> 01:33:28,323
family, so to speak,

2759
01:33:28,323 --> 01:33:30,606
and a little love, kindness and pride

2760
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:32,515
will take us a long way.

2761
01:33:32,515 --> 01:33:35,533
Just remember, the bottom line is

2762
01:33:35,533 --> 01:33:37,518
I'm okay, you're okay

2763
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:39,331
and nothing else matters.

2764
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:40,771
Peace.
