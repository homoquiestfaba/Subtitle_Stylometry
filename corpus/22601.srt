00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,439
WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA

2
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,716
Starling!

3
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,196
Starling!

4
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,998
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

5
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,076
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,436
- Clarice.
- Hey.

7
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,470
You looking for Crawford? He should
be back in a minute. Wait in his office.

8
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,071
Starling.

9
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,476
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.

10
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,831
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

11
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,032
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

12
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,152
I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

13
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,908
A job's come up and I thought about you.

14
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,272
Not a job, really. More of
an interesting errand. Sit down.

15
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,152
Yes, sir.

16
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,116
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

17
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,074
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.

18
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,555
A-minus, sir.

19
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,157
Double major: psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

20
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,953
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

21
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,756
It says, when you graduate, you wanna
work for me in Behavioural Science.

22
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,836
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

23
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,950
We're interviewing all serial killers now in
custody for a psycho-behavioural profile.

24
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,594
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

25
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,154
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

26
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,559
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.

27
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,353
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

28
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,153
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

29
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,159
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

30
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,430
Hannibal the Cannibal.

31
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,120
I don't expect him to talk to you.

32
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,709
But I have to be able to say we tried.

33
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,832
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

34
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,396
How does he look? How does
his cell look? ls he sketching, drawing?

35
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,080
If he is, what's he sketching?

36
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

37
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,116
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

38
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

39
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,876
OK.

40
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,195
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.

41
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,517
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

42
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,191
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

43
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,630
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

44
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,477
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all
the physical procedures used with him.

45
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,070
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

46
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,668
And you're to tell him nothing personal.

47
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,236
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

48
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,272
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

49
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,389
And what is that?

50
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,674
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.

51
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,230
So rare to capture one alive.

52
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,672
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

53
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,275
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

54
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,954
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

55
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,995
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

56
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,236
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,

57
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,559
but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

58
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,877
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

59
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,551
We've tried to study him, but he's much
too sophisticated for the standard tests.

60
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,875
Oh, my, does he hate us!

61
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,117
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

62
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,193
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

63
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,438
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.

64
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,514
I don't believe Lecter's
seen a woman in eight years.

65
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,349
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.

66
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,358
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.

67
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,950
Good. Then you should
be able to remember the rules.

68
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,234
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

69
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,955
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.

70
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,676
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts
to pass you anything, do not accept it.

71
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,315
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

72
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,632
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

73
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,118
On July 8, 1981 , he complained of chest
pains and was taken to the dispensary.

74
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
His restraints were removed for an EKG.

75
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,515
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

76
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,951
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

77
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,471
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

78
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,033
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.

79
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,350
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

80
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,235
then maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself. What do you think?

81
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,070
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

82
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,228
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

83
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,038
When she's finished, bring her out.

84
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,918
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

85
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,954
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

86
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,914
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can
hang your coat up there if you like.

87
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,395
Thank you. I will.

88
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,868
He's past the others, the last cell.

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,355
You keep to the right.

90
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,993
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.

91
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,038
I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.

92
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,276
Hi.

93
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,075
I can smell your cunt!

94
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,270
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

95
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,197
May I speak with you?

96
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,834
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

97
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,033
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?

98
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,596
Certainly.

99
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,995
Closer, please.

100
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,552
Closer.

101
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,037
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBl, are you?

102
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,869
I'm still in training at the academy.

103
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,793
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

104
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,959
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

105
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,835
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.

106
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,432
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

107
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,235
Sit, please.

108
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,314
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

109
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,034
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

110
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,232
He hissed at you. What did he say?

111
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,398
He said "I can smell your cunt."

112
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,154
I see.

113
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,635
I myself cannot.

114
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,235
You use Evyan skin cream.

115
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,633
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

116
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,275
But not today.

117
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,120
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

118
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,351
That is the Duomo
seen from the Belvedere.

119
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,237
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?

120
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,239
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

121
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,992
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

122
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,714
Oh, no, no, no, no.

123
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,516
You were doing fine. You had been
courteous and receptive to courtesy.

124
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,918
You had established trust, with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

125
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,591
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

126
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,190
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.

127
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,276
Either you will or you won't.

128
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,029
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

129
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,833
if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

130
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,633
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.

131
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,910
What a naughty boy he is.

132
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,437
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

133
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,836
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

134
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,394
It started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

135
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,433
They said
"This one likes to skin his humps."

136
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,873
Why do you think he removes
their skins, Agent Starling?

137
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,150
Thrill me with your acumen.

138
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,119
It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

139
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,153
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.

140
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,756
You send that through now.

141
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,550
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can
dissect me with this blunt little tool?

142
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,513
No. I thought that your knowledge...

143
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,790
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

144
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,630
Do you know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

145
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,751
You look like a rube.

146
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,793
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,
with a little taste.

147
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,795
Good nutrition's given you length of bone,

148
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,948
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you?

149
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,870
And that accent you've tried so
desperately to shed: pure West Virginia.

150
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,993
What is your father, dear? ls he
a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?

151
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
How quickly the boys found you.

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,350
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

153
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,836
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

154
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,953
getting all the way to the FBl.

155
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,439
You see a lot, Doctor.

156
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,396
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

157
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,958
What about it? Why don't you look at
yourself and write down what you see?

158
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,435
Or maybe you're afraid to.

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,878
A census taker once tried to test me.

160
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,151
I ate his liver with some fava beans

161
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,635
and a nice Chianti.

162
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,957
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

163
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,593
Fly, fly, fly.

164
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,033
I bit my wrist so I can die.

165
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,276
Look at the blood!

166
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,154
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!

167
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,758
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!

168
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,634
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.

169
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,672
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.

170
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,792
No, but I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

171
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,639
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.

172
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,274
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

173
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,109
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

174
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,234
I don't think Miggs could manage again
so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!

175
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,396
Hey, Bill.

176
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,435
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

177
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,874
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

178
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,550
FBl. Hands up. Don't move.

179
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,468
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

180
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,115
You're dead, Starling.

181
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,199
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

182
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,673
- The corner.
- Did you check?

183
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,438
- No.
- That's why you're dead.

184
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,711
3109.

185
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,957
3109. Breaking doors or windows

186
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,799
to enter or exit.

187
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,239
Rule 404.

188
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,353
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

189
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,194
- Starling?
- Sir?

190
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,629
Miggs is dead.

191
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,432
Dead?

192
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,959
How?

193
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,470
They heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

194
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,593
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

195
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,197
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.

196
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,357
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.

197
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,277
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

198
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,918
Look, I know it got ugly today, but
you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.

199
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,395
Any follow-up on her?

200
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,671
Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories,

201
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,156
so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet, but

202
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,353
I thought the "yourself" reference
was too hokey for Lecter,

203
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,359
so I figured he's from Baltimore
and I looked in the phone book

204
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,237
and there's a "Your Self" storage facility
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

205
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,032
Unit 31 was leased for ten years,
pre-paid in full.

206
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,950
The contract is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

207
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,554
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

208
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,875
Not to my knowledge.

209
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,629
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

210
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,911
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

211
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,235
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

212
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,273
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

213
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,073
What about him?

214
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,796
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

215
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,514
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

216
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,391
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.

217
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,433
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

218
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,798
this is the number for
our Baltimore field office.

219
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,674
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.

220
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,155
Yes, Miss Starling.

221
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,835
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.

222
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,353
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, Doctor?

223
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,472
Hester Mofet. "The rest of me."

224
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,833
"Miss the rest of me."
Meaning that you rented that garage?

225
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,436
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.

226
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,756
How did you...?

227
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,474
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

228
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,635
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

229
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,877
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

230
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,959
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.

231
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,516
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

232
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,835
You wanted me to find him.

233
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,159
His real name is Benjamin Raspail,
a former patient of mine,

234
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,671
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

235
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,199
I did not kill him, merely tucked him
away very much as I found him,

236
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,835
after he'd missed three appointments.

237
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,159
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

238
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,589
His therapy was going nowhere.

239
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,634
His dress, make-up...

240
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,433
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.

241
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,236
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.

242
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,715
I now just think of him
as a kind of experiment.

243
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,310
A fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

244
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,193
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

245
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,718
Scared at first, then exhilarated.

246
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,797
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.

247
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,876
I never thought about it.

248
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,673
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

249
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,794
True, he is much older, but do you think
he visualises scenarios, exchanges,

250
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,275
fucking you?

251
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,751
That doesn't interest me and, frankly,
it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

252
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,195
Not any more.

253
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,995
Thank you, Barney.

254
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,395
What happened to your drawings?

255
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,632
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel programme.

256
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,638
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

257
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,957
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

258
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,110
What did you mean
by "transformation", Doctor?

259
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,036
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

260
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,073
I know they will never ever
let me out while I'm alive.

261
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,316
What I want is a view.

262
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,149
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

263
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,636
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr Chilton.

264
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,231
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?
Are you saying that he's killed again?

265
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,832
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.

266
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,155
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

267
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,716
You know who he is, don't you?

268
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,034
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

269
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,072
All good things to those who wait.

270
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,432
I've waited, Clarice, but how long
can you and old Jackie Boy wait?

271
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,954
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

272
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,149
MEMPHIS, TN

273
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,556
Hey, little cheeper.

274
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,591
I'll be right there.

275
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,876
Can I help you with that?

276
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,516
- Would you?
- Sure.

277
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,273
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.

278
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,757
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

279
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,997
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.

280
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,509
Just set it down. That's good.

281
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,519
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.

282
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,076
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.

283
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,476
Push it all the way back.

284
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,116
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

285
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,834
- That's great.
- OK.

286
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,394
Say, are you about a size 14?

287
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,476
Sorry?

288
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,916
Good.

289
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,676
Oh, good.

290
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,753
Good.

291
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,556
Starling!

292
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,316
Outside. Let's go.

293
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,675
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.

294
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,758
FBl!

295
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,348
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.

296
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,550
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.

297
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,433
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.

298
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,478
CLAY COUNTY, W VA

299
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,918
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

300
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,952
No evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

301
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,231
All the mutilation
you see there is postmortem.

302
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,272
OK, three days. Then he shoots them,

303
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,598
skins them and dumps them,
each body in a different river.

304
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,678
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

305
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,155
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

306
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,192
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

307
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,073
so actually she was the third girl found.

308
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,112
After her, he got lazy.

309
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,715
OK, let's see.

310
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,312
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

311
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,991
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

312
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,509
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

313
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,760
He's a white male. Serial killers tend
to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

314
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,396
He's not a drifter. He's got his own
house somewhere, not an apartment.

315
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,751
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

316
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,237
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength,

317
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,954
combined with
an older man's self-control.

318
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,150
He's cautious, precise...

319
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,158
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

320
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,874
Why not?

321
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,198
Got a real taste for it now
and he's getting better at his work.

322
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,680
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

323
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,070
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything
about the information in my report

324
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,270
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

325
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,916
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

326
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,838
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

327
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,433
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

328
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,719
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.

329
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,435
He would have toyed with you
then turned to stone.

330
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,637
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

331
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,673
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBl.
Special Agent Terry.

332
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,349
Agent Starling. We appreciate
being invited into your jurisdiction.

333
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,790
I didn't call you. That was
the state attorney's office.

334
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,879
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.

335
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,710
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

336
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,796
Know what I mean?

337
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,910
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.

338
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,271
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

339
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,517
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

340
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,514
I need a six-way linkup.

341
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,631
Chicago, Detroit...

342
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,716
What?

343
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,109
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,

344
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,834
Iisten here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

345
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,397
I know that y'all brought her this far and
her folks would thank you if they could

346
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,670
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

347
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,997
But now please go on now
and let us take care of her.

348
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,836
Go on now.

349
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,076
Thank you.

350
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,797
Thank you.

351
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,916
OK, good.

352
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.

353
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,275
Stand by for transmission.

354
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,516
Ray.

355
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,791
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

356
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,676
OK, Starling.

357
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,956
Bill.

358
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,878
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

359
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,916
A muzzle stamp at the top.

360
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,110
Wrongful death.

361
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,516
She'll have to go to
the state pathologist at Claxton.

362
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,679
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.

363
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,756
Lord Almighty.

364
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,558
What else do you see, Starling?

365
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,035
Well, she's not local.

366
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,154
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's glitter nail polish.

367
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,635
That looks like town to me.

368
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,432
Two of her fingernails are broken off
and there's dirt or grit under them.

369
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,916
It looks like she's tried
to claw her way through something.

370
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,511
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.

371
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,356
Let's do another.

372
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,113
She's got something in her throat.

373
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,916
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.

374
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,913
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?

375
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,829
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

376
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,114
There's no way that could
get way down in there.

377
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,038
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

378
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,675
She'll be easier to print when we turn
her over. Lamar, give me a hand.

379
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,756
Yes, sir. I will.

380
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,032
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.

381
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,720
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed,

382
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,230
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

383
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,796
Exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

384
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,388
six inches from the right shoulder blade.

385
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,038
Starling, when I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

386
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,116
that really burned you, didn't it?

387
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,676
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

388
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,918
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

389
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,395
- It matters.
- Point taken.

390
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,474
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.

391
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,479
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

392
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,113
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.

393
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,596
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

394
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,915
Nice and slow, baby.

395
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,794
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

396
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,915
Course it counts. How do you play?

397
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,756
Agent Starling?

398
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,350
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

399
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,792
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim in the Elk River.

400
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,878
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.

401
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,436
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?

402
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,075
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

403
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,313
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.

404
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,079
Boy, he's a big sucker.

405
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,870
OK. Let's check morphology.

406
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,192
What do you do when you're
not detecting, Agent Starling?

407
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,675
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

408
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,357
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

409
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,596
The amusing house wine?

410
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,150
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

411
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,315
Yes.

412
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,158
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?

413
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,990
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.

414
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,435
Weird.

415
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,632
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

416
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,753
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.

417
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,599
Here they'd have to be
raised from imported eggs.

418
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:43,477
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey
and nightshade, kept him warm.

419
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,068
Somebody loved him.

420
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,036
Where are you?

421
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,916
Let me outta here!

422
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,796
Help me!

423
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,956
Please!

424
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,436
Please help me.

425
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,437
Please!

426
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,994
Why won't you answer me? Please!

427
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,037
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

428
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,391
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

429
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,229
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

430
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,557
Iisted as missing, is now
believed to have been kidnapped

431
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,433
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

432
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,950
Police indicate that the girl's
blouse has been identified,

433
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,517
sliced up the back, in what has become
a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.

434
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,269
Young Catherine Martin is the only
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

435
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,550
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

436
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,990
Her kidnapping is not considered
to be politically motivated,

437
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,157
but it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

438
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,637
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Vermont, the president is said to be,

439
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,876
and I quote, "intensely concerned".

440
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,391
Just moments ago Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea.

441
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,798
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

442
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,198
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

443
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,435
Talk to her and you'll see.

444
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,438
You have the power. You are in charge.

445
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,831
I know you can feel love and compassion.

446
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,915
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

447
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,430
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

448
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,588
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

449
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,711
You have that power.

450
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,831
Please.

451
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,837
My daughter is Catherine.

452
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,635
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.

453
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,910
She keeps repeating the name.

454
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,717
If he sees Catherine as a person and not
just an object, it's harder to tear her up.

455
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,149
Release my little girl.

456
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,670
You're coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

457
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,554
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

458
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,798
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

459
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,276
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

460
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,757
Look, I am not just
some turnkey, Miss Starling.

461
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,718
This is the number
for the US attorney's office.

462
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,960
Either you discuss this with him or you
let me do my job, do you understand?

463
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,669
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,

464
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,155
the senator promises you a transfer

465
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,353
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

466
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,358
Maximum security still applies, of course.

467
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,631
You'd have reasonable access to books.

468
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,910
Best of all, though,

469
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,999
one week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital

470
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,076
and go here.

471
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,393
Plum lsland.

472
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,036
Every day of that week you may walk on
the beach, you may swim in the ocean,

473
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,631
for up to one hour, under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

474
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,675
And there you have it.

475
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,076
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

476
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,875
A copy of the senator's offer.

477
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,754
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

478
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,838
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

479
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,550
"Plum lsland Animal Disease
Research Centre."

480
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,390
Sounds charming.

481
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,990
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

482
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,590
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

483
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,517
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us too.

484
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,598
Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

485
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,359
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

486
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,392
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

487
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,190
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

488
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,555
Go, Doctor.

489
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,319
What is your worst memory of childhood?

490
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,555
The death of my father.

491
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,592
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.

492
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,596
He was a town marshal.

493
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,952
One night he surprised two burglars

494
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,435
coming out the back of a drugstore.

495
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,596
They shot him.

496
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,790
Was he killed outright?

497
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,708
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

498
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,713
My mother died when I was very young.

499
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,677
My father had become the whole world to
me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.

500
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,950
I was ten years old.

501
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,273
You're very frank, Clarice.

502
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,030
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

503
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,353
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

504
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,871
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

505
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,831
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?

506
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,032
- They all were.
- What else?

507
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,039
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

508
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,472
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

509
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,433
Was it a butterfly?

510
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,516
Yes. A moth.

511
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,958
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

512
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,799
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

513
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,708
The significance of the moth is change.

514
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,150
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,

515
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,113
and from thence into beauty.

516
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,073
Our Billy wants to change, too.

517
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,792
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

518
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,037
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

519
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,675
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him, do you realise that?

520
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,189
No. Tell me why.

521
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,075
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

522
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,071
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

523
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,558
I lived with my mother's cousin and her
husband in Montana. They had a ranch.

524
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,990
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

525
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,756
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

526
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,192
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

527
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,108
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

528
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,674
Did he sodomise you?

529
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,156
No. He was a very decent man.

530
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,795
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

531
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,597
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

532
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,757
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

533
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,555
You said that I was very close to the way
we would catch him. What did you mean?

534
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,070
There are three centres for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

535
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,476
the University of Minnesota
and Columbus Medical Centre.

536
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,196
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment at all of them

537
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,595
and been rejected.

538
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,314
On what basis would they reject him?

539
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,797
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

540
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,753
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

541
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,873
He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.

542
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,276
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

543
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,073
and he thinks
that makes him a transsexual.

544
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,034
But his pathology is
a thousand times more savage

545
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,515
and more terrifying.

546
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,592
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

547
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,318
Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever
ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

548
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,831
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

549
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,111
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.

550
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,196
OK, OK.

551
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,035
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.

552
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,709
See, my mom is a real important woman.

553
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,956
I guess you already know that.

554
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,152
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

555
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,633
Please!

556
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,156
Please!

557
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,071
I wanna go home, please!

558
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,430
It places the lotion in the basket.

559
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,316
I wanna see my mommy!

560
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,879
Please!

561
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,956
I wanna see my...

562
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,196
I wanna see my mommy.

563
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,235
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

564
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,508
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

565
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,154
I don't think so.

566
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,669
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

567
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,360
She never heard of any deal with you.

568
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,760
They scammed you, Hannibal.

569
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,315
Stand outside.

570
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,916
And shut the door.

571
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,998
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

572
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:43,035
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

573
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,314
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and, if the girl is found in time,

574
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,639
Senator Martin will have you transferred
to the state prison in Tennessee.

575
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,433
Answer me, Hannibal.

576
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,871
You answer me now or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

577
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,676
Who is Buffalo Bill?

578
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,075
His first name is Louis.

579
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,476
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

580
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,353
And I have a few conditions of my own.

581
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,751
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

582
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,831
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

583
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,234
Transferred?

584
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,638
Did you have a trainee make a phoney
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

585
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,796
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.

586
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,833
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

587
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,758
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

588
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,555
MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

589
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,837
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

590
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,951
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

591
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,073
You be a gentleman, you're gonna
get three hots and a cot.

592
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,079
Sir. You sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

593
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,919
Where's...?

594
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,956
Here, sir. Use mine.

595
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,714
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.

596
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,038
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

597
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,072
You'll wanna read it before I sign.

598
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,358
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time, bargaining for petty privileges.

599
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,598
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.

600
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,030
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

601
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,116
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

602
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,595
You have my word. Paul?

603
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,114
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

604
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,268
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May 1980

605
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,073
by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.

606
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,270
They were lovers, you see.

607
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,313
But Raspail had become very frightened.

608
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,750
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

609
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,997
and done things with the skin.

610
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,669
We need his address
and a physical description.

611
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,316
Tell me, Senator. Did you
nurse Catherine yourself?

612
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,030
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

613
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,720
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

614
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,555
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

615
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,309
Amputate a man's leg
and he can still feel it tickling.

616
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,309
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

617
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,032
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

618
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,238
Five foot ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

619
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,920
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.

620
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,272
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived
in Philadelphia but may have lied.

621
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:01,111
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.

622
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,510
And, Senator, just one more thing.

623
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,234
Love your suit.

624
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,717
In a meeting this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,

625
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,832
Dr Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

626
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,793
of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.

627
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,559
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind

628
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,990
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?

629
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,476
That is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

630
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,195
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?

631
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,351
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

632
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,756
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.

633
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,235
I understand, sir.

634
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,715
Log in and check your weapon.

635
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,034
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

636
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,072
people at the FBl, folks
at the Baltimore state hospital.

637
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,431
And now for the hard part:
apprehending the suspect.

638
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,030
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

639
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,271
Is it true what they're sayin'?

640
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,190
He's some kind of vampire?

641
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,312
They don't have a name for what he is.

642
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,749
You do know the rules, ma'am?

643
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,509
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

644
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,516
Go ahead.

645
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,430
Good evening, Clarice.

646
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,514
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

647
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,434
Just until you get your view.

648
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,120
How very thoughtful.

649
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,353
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

650
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,994
before you're both booted off the case?

651
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,759
No, I came because I wanted to.

652
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,989
People will say we're in love.

653
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,434
Anthrax lsland.

654
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,518
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

655
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,279
- Yours?
- Yes.

656
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,470
Yeah.

657
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,229
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

658
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,874
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

659
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,072
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

660
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,236
Louis Friend?

661
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,352
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

662
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,514
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

663
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,835
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.

664
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,633
I've read the case files. Have you?

665
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,672
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

666
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,396
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

667
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,435
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask what is it in itself?

668
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,551
What is its nature?

669
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,434
What does he do, this man you seek?

670
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,078
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.

671
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,955
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

672
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,436
Anger.

673
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,236
Social acceptance.

674
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,712
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.

675
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,792
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

676
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,438
Do we seek out things to covet?

677
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,516
Make an effort to answer now.

678
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,154
No. We just...

679
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,477
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

680
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,751
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

681
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,711
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

682
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,948
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...

683
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,789
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

684
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,957
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

685
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,594
Why did you leave that ranch?

686
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,713
Doctor, we don't have
any more time for any of this now.

687
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,308
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

688
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,592
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...

689
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,917
No. I will listen now.

690
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,958
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

691
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,629
You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

692
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,716
And?

693
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,996
And one morning I just ran away.

694
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,196
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?

695
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,790
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

696
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,708
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

697
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,874
I heard a strange noise.

698
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,911
What was it?

699
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,112
It was screaming.

700
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,232
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.

701
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,237
What did you do?

702
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,874
I went downstairs.

703
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,956
Outside.

704
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,999
I crept up into the barn.

705
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,829
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

706
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,431
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

707
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,110
Lambs.

708
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,231
They were screaming.

709
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,999
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

710
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,312
And they were screaming.

711
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,116
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.

712
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,835
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

713
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,509
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

714
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,552
But you could - and you did, didn't you?

715
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,229
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

716
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,478
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food,

717
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,751
any water and it was very cold, very cold.

718
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,751
I thought...

719
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,838
I thought if I could save just one, but...

720
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,668
He was so heavy.

721
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,756
So heavy.

722
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,956
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

723
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,876
The rancher was so angry, he sent me
to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.

724
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,150
I never saw the ranch again.

725
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,194
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

726
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,749
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

727
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,269
Wake up in the dark

728
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,039
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

729
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,556
Yes.

730
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,239
And you think, if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

731
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,430
You think if Catherine lives,

732
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,791
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

733
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,639
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

734
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,113
I don't know.

735
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,557
I don't know.

736
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,596
Thank you, Clarice.

737
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,518
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.

738
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,073
Dr Chilton, I presume.

739
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,555
I think you know each other.

740
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,916
OK.

741
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,070
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.

742
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,191
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

743
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,279
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have
to put you on a plane. Come on now.

744
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,595
Brave Clarice.

745
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,156
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

746
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,637
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.

747
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,354
Your case file.

748
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,999
Goodbye, Clarice.

749
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,959
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.

750
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,077
Son of a bitch demanded a second
dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.

751
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:57,830
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

752
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,795
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.

753
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,876
Same drill as before, please.

754
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,113
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

755
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,436
OK.

756
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,116
Hand me that, would ya?

757
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,156
Thanks.

758
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,673
Mind the drawings, please.

759
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,756
Thank you.

760
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,034
Watch it. He's cuffed me!

761
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,276
Jesus Christ!

762
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,993
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

763
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,751
What is this shit?

764
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,635
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

765
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,752
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

766
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,193
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: shots fired on five.

767
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,276
Sergeant Tate.

768
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,794
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?

769
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,468
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.

770
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,319
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...

771
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,396
Look!

772
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,558
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.

773
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,319
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

774
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,317
We're goin' up.

775
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,591
Pembry!

776
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,476
Boyle!

777
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,550
Oh, God.

778
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,436
Go.

779
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,112
- Clear.
- Command post.

780
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,595
Two officers down.

781
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,952
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.

782
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,358
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.

783
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,678
He's stripped the bed. Might be
makin' a rope. Check all windows.

784
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,589
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

785
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:24,239
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

786
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,996
Get a hold of him
and feel his hand. Talk to him.

787
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,749
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!

788
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,076
Lecter is missing and armed.

789
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,316
Pembry, can you hear me?

790
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,150
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

791
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,955
Keep breathin' in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.

792
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,355
You look real good.

793
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,233
Yeah, you look real good.

794
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,317
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

795
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,396
Let's go.

796
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,273
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna
make it. You're doin' just fine.

797
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,709
I need that IV now!

798
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,753
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?

799
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,235
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

800
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,595
We're losin' him. Downstairs.

801
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,668
And up.

802
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,756
Elevator!

803
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,872
CP to Tate.

804
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,753
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

805
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,713
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

806
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,229
He seems to be hangin' on.

807
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,749
Top three floors secured.

808
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,836
Main stairwell secured.

809
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,796
We think he's on two.

810
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,635
Tate, are you still with me?

811
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:27,228
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,
sir. That's all for now. Over.

812
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,515
He's on the roof of the elevator.

813
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,951
OK, guys.

814
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,719
I see him.

815
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,035
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

816
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,519
- One warning: we need him alive.
- Got it.

817
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,273
Lecter, put your hands on your head.

818
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,076
One in the leg.

819
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,230
No movement.

820
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,792
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're comin' into the car.

821
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,115
We're openin' the hatch.

822
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,312
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

823
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,431
- Affirm.
- Got it.

824
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,436
Memphis General, medical unit 26.

825
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,792
We're inbound with a male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.

826
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,357
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.

827
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,313
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 1 30 over 90.

828
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,749
- 90?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

829
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,635
We got him on lactated Ringer's and
the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...

830
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:44,393
They found the ambulance in a parking
garage at the airport. Crew was dead.

831
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,435
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

832
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,957
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.

833
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,275
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

834
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,757
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.

835
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,589
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.

836
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:06,952
The thing is that Lecter said everything
we need to catch him is in these pages.

837
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,469
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.

838
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,955
He's here, Ardelia.

839
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,675
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

840
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,312
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random,

841
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,115
Iike the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter."

842
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,834
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

843
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:58,272
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

844
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,472
But there is no pattern
or the computers would have nailed it.

845
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,037
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.

846
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,994
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.

847
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,357
From Belvedere, Ohio.

848
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,313
First girl taken, third body found.

849
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,238
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

850
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,591
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

851
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:27,669
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.

852
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,234
How do we first start to covet?

853
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,876
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

854
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,871
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

855
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,909
BELVEDERE, OHIO

856
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,876
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

857
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,468
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBl.

858
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,676
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

859
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,950
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

860
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,356
Police been back here
so many times already.

861
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,473
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

862
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,990
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.

863
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,069
Her bedroom's how she left it.

864
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,714
Upstairs. Door to the left.

865
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,990
He's making himself a "woman suit",
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

866
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,554
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.

867
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,955
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...

868
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,550
That's why they're so big. He has to
keep them alive so he can starve them,

869
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,195
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.

870
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,311
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.

871
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,273
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

872
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,039
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.

873
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,276
That's great news, sir, but how...

874
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,836
Johns Hopkins came up with some
names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.

875
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,873
Subject's name
is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a John Grant.

876
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,550
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

877
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,830
Customs had some paper on him.

878
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,273
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.

879
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,198
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

880
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,513
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

881
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,872
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

882
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,879
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

883
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,116
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.

884
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,755
Starling, we wouldn't
have found him without you.

885
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,236
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

886
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,155
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.

887
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,713
Mr Crawford?

888
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,115
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

889
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,595
I got a better idea.

890
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,353
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.

891
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,476
Precious!

892
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,754
Come on, girl!

893
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,269
Come on, Precious.

894
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,957
Come on, Precious!

895
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:35,153
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.

896
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,910
Precious!

897
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,190
Are you up there, you little shit?

898
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,794
Come and get it, pretty girl.

899
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,675
Precious, please come. Come on.

900
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,879
Would you fuck me?

901
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,430
Come on. Take that bone.

902
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,068
I'd fuck me.

903
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,075
Come on.

904
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,876
I'd fuck me hard.

905
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,956
I'd fuck me so hard.

906
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:45,555
No.

907
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,872
AIR NATIONAL GUARD HQ
CHICAGO, IL

908
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,915
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

909
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,076
I mean, better places than this?

910
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,995
Sometimes you do.

911
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:58,352
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

912
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:02,359
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

913
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,153
She thought it was such hot shit.

914
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,635
What did she know? Big dummy.

915
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:13,471
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

916
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,435
- How about John Grant?
- No.

917
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,279
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

918
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,550
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

919
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:25,434
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?

920
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:30,509
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help
her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.

921
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,110
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

922
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,149
CALUMET CITY, IL

923
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,958
So powerful. So beautiful.

924
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,236
Precious?

925
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:19,391
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!

926
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:32,158
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.

927
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,510
Poodlie-poo. Precious.

928
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:42,031
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.

929
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,032
She broke her leg
on the way down. I know it.

930
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,869
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!

931
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,116
You don't know what pain is!

932
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:12,192
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be gettin' me that telephone!

933
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,875
I'm gonna do it, mister!

934
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,831
All right, mister! I'm doin' it!

935
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,156
OK, I'm coming.

936
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:48,876
We're goin' in.

937
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:57,436
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.

938
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,548
FBl! Everybody down!

939
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,148
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.

940
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,430
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.

941
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,272
Clear!

942
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,036
What's the problem, officer?

943
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:13,799
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

944
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,595
There's no one here, Jack.

945
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,269
Clarice.

946
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,039
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.

947
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:30,109
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to
work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

948
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,071
No. Uh-uh.

949
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,792
Oh, wait.

950
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,990
Was she a great, big, fat person?

951
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,156
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...

952
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,669
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

953
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,994
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

954
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,953
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.

955
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,435
- May l?
- Yeah, sure.

956
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,916
Are you close to catchin'
somebody, you think?

957
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,996
Yes. We may be.

958
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:24,149
Did you take over this place
after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?

959
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,232
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

960
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,710
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

961
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:37,991
Tax forms? List of employees?

962
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,315
No, nothin' like that at all.

963
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,998
Say, has the FBI learned something?

964
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,795
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

965
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:04,231
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

966
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,316
No.

967
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,796
No, we don't.

968
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,235
Here's that number.

969
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,509
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

970
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,276
Sure, you can use my phone.

971
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,592
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.

972
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,192
And turn around. Spread your legs.

973
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:47,717
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.

974
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,796
Freeze!

975
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,554
Hello? Are you there?

976
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,955
I'm down here!

977
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,520
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

978
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,399
FBl. You're safe.

979
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,875
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!

980
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:13,157
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

981
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:17,239
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.

982
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,111
Just get me outta here!

983
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,076
Oh, my God.

984
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,673
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

985
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,950
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.

986
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:34,755
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch!

987
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,589
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

988
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,317
Please!

989
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,113
I gotta get outta here!

990
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:53,151
Catherine, the other officers'll
be here any minute now.

991
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,068
Wait! Don't go! Please!

992
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,394
Quiet!

993
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,358
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.

994
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,675
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?

995
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,756
Clarice M Starling.

996
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,436
Congratulations.

997
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,716
Special Agent Starling.

998
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,354
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

999
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,436
- Excuse me.
- Starling.

1000
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,635
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1001
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,716
Yeah. Sure.

1002
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:57,512
Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

1003
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:01,189
I'm not much good at this kinda thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

1004
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,276
OK. Sure.

1005
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,555
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

1006
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:16,632
Your father would have been proud today.

1007
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,075
Don't forget your phone call.

1008
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,918
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?

1009
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,835
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1010
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,515
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.

1011
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,437
I won't be on long enough.

1012
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,919
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1013
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,873
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1014
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,912
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1015
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,395
You know I can't make that promise.

1016
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,115
I do wish we could chat longer but...

1017
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:58,233
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1018
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:01,834
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?

1019
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,676
Dr Lecter?

1020
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:17,073
Excuse me. You got
the security system all set up?

1021
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,239
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
