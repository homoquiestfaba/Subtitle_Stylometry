Move over, little doll

Breathe the air, Mrs. Donnelly!

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm eating dust.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,560
The wind in your hair!

I will not hear your negativity.

Madam, this is Route 66

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,682
and we are most assuredly
getting our kicks!

on my back door

Move over, nice doll
The mean old dog's going in

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
Hi. I'm Chet and I'll be
happy to valet your car.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,124
Not as happy as we are
that you are happy to do so, my friend.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Just tell me... Just tell me

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,120
there's a cup of tea
and a biscuit waiting inside.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,124
That's a great accent.

The sound of destiny, madam...

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
calling us with her siren song.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,720
And go to her we must!

Somebody else?

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,080
My hand is powdered,
so the shake is firm and dry.

My clothes precisely walk the tightrope

between casual and relaxed formality.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,730
Sonny, Sonny. Let me do the talking.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,242
- Alright?
- Okay.

(CLEARS THROAT)

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,764
Mr. Burley.

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
While I am aware that...

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
convention dictates that I should wait

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,680
for your assessment of our proposal...

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,085
please take my interruption
less as rudeness than proof...

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,520
of our profound excitement
at the opportunity to meet yourself...

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
and your fine company.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,280
And let me say right here and now...

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,442
Alright, that's enough, that's enough.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,240
We agreed that my colleague would do

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,607
the speaking and rightly so for...

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,166
while her language may be... salty,
it has great economy and pith.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,882
MURIEL: I don't care about any of that.

51
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,160
No, listen and learn, son.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,720
Tea is an herb that's been dried out.

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,282
So to bring it back to life,
you have to infuse it...

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,562
in boiling water.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
That is boiling water.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,040
Everywhere I've been in this country...

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
they slap down
a cup of tepid nonsense...

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,760
you know with the teabag
lying beside it...

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,640
which means I've got to go through

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,520
the ridiculous business of dunking it...

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,808
in the lukewarm piss...

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,160
waiting for the slightest change
of color to occur.

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,120
And at my age... I haven't got the time.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
This is what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,521
Get her some boiling water.

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,167
Now, Mrs. Donnelly.
Tell me more about your establishment.

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,165
MURIEL: We've been going properly
for about eight months now.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,524
But phase two of the development
is more or less complete.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Like life and a tortoise.

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not exactly fast-moving...

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,320
- Mrs. Evelyn Greenslade.
- Here.

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,320
MURIEL: ...but you only make progress
when you stick your neck out.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,687
- Mr. Douglas Ainslie.
- Here.

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
We have guests that come and go.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,760
- Mrs. Muriel Donnelly.
- Here.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,760
But there's been a hard core
of regulars from the beginning.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,040
- Mrs. Madge Hardcastle.
- Here.

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Mr. Norman Cousins and Miss Carol Parr.

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
BOTH: Both here.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,240
We have monthly check-ups
at the local clinic...

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,240
and Sonny takes
a roll-call every morning.

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,440
A most valuable precaution to ensure

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,568
that nobody has died in the night.

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,840
MURIEL: Most of our guests don't just
live in India, they now work there.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
EVELYN: These are lovely.

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
HARI: That is why they
cost 10,000 rupees each.

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,960
(CHUCKLES) Every day?
We have to do this every day?

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,200
Process, madam.
We must respect the process.

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
Very well. You and I both know

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,960
that since a fine, genuine pashmina...

91
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,760
requires the annual growth
of at least three Changra goats...

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
you and everyone in this market

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,080
blend the yarn to give it more body.

94
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
The reason I come to this stall is that

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,760
whereas Bharat over there uses wool...

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,480
and Mohan goes with the rabbit fur...

97
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,280
you at least use a reasonable
quality of silk.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I'll give you 5,000 for four.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,680
Done.

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,921
Thank you.

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
I'll see you tomorrow, Hari.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Tomorrow, Miss Evelyn.
And thank you for your respect.

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,400
MURIEL: Two of the guests
have made themselves useful

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,840
at the local expats club.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Which is, shall we say,
a little down on its uppers.

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,603
- Norman...
- Mmm?

107
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,920
I know the membership's dropping,
times are tight, but...

108
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,400
do you really have
to water down the wine?

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,291
What?! I uncorked it myself.

110
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,248
They're on to us.

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's try the red.

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,200
MURIEL: And others are doing jobs
they never thought they could do.

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,480
One Queen was so
close to her elephant...

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,800
that when she passed away, the elephant

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,962
stood beside her tomb for three days...

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,480
before dying of grief.

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,360
We should all know such love,

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,330
just not necessarily from an elephant.

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,320
MURIEL: And sometimes
they're right, they can't.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
- Uh, when were these built?
- I'm sorry?

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,291
- What period are we talking about?
- What, um...

122
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,010
period? Ah, uh... yeah. Um...

123
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
17th... 17th century.

124
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,890
17th century.

125
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
- Sure?
- Absolutely positive.

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,128
- Wait, wait, wait. Maybe 18th.
- Oh, oh, oh...

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,480
Please admire the beautifully carved...

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,240

MURIEL: Look, I could talk and talk...

137
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,760
but all that counts in the end
is this one had an idea.

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,606
I know, I know, but it works.

139
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,600
The proof of our success
is we are victims of it.

140
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,440
The Marigold Hotel is full up.

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,288
With nobody checking out.
Until the ultimate check-out.

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,848
So we have to expand.

143
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
There's a local place
we've got our eye on.

144
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
The Supreme Quality Hotel.

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
You put up the notes, we buy it.

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,920
And we become the furthest outpost
of the Evergreen franchise.

Leading to a chain of hotels
stretching across India and beyond...

and whose mind,
though failing, still contains

159

If you'll indulge me.

160
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,762
Evergreen is a different concept.

161
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,962
We believe that the...

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,960
well that the leaves don't need to fall.

163
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,920
That these years, the mature years...

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,320
are an opportunity for travel,
for further education...

165

for different work situations.

166
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,251
Well, in a word,
an opportunity for life.

167
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,325
And for passing on the value
of that life to others.

168
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,604
I take it you would agree
with me, Mrs. Donnelly?

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,083
I'm here, aren't I?

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you talking to other
companies about this?

171
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,480
MURIEL: We came to you first.
We do have competitors.

172
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,768
Not in our eyes.

173
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,680
SUNAINA ON LAPTOP: And did you
tell them about the roll-call?

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
SONNY: With a spoon, they ate it up.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,240
Sonny, this is huge.

347
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,201
Well, congratulations.

348
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,360
It would mean a lot of traveling.

349
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Yes, I expect so. You'll love that.

350
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,562
She hasn't said "yes" yet.

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,651
Well, she will. Of course she will.

352
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,570
What's stopping her?

353
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,400
You see I think the problem
this time is the piston...

354
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,760
which must have had
what we call a seizure.

355
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
But, luckily, Cyril at the bike shop

356
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,611
has this tool called
a gudgeon pin remover...

357
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
which should minimize damage

358
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
to the bearing at either
end of the con rod...

359
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
or, God forbid, the con rod itself.

360
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,051
I think you're just
making these words up.

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,560
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

362
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,087
Would you have asked my opinion?

363
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,882
Sorry?

364
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,880
If I hadn't have come in,

365
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,691
would you have talked it over
with me before saying "yes"?

366
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Of course I'd have told you tonight

367
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
and asked you what you thought.

368
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
Thank you.

369
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
What do you think?

370
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
That you'll do it wonderfully.

371
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
NORMAN: Good morning, Ainslie.

372
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,760
Morning, you two.

373
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,800
Not riding the bike, Douglas?

374
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,040
No, the piston's seized up.

375
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,284
But luckily everything can be saved
by a device called a gudgeon pin remover.

376
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,640
NORMAN: We just popped out
for some of those pancakes.

377
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,041
I don't suppose you'd care to join...

378
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
EVELYN: Good Lord. Are you alright?

379
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,522
CAROL: I'm fine.

380
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,120
- Thank you.
- Nothing I haven't done before.

381
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,640
Something must have
gone wrong with his steering.

382
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,168
It almost looked as if
he was aiming straight at you.

383
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,651
You could be killed
by one of those things.

384
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,485
Oh, God.

385
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,720
How I wish I could
prevail upon you to stay.

386
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,531
- Always leave them wanting more, Nimish.
- (CHUCKLES)

387
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,360
Are we going to the Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel, madam?

388
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,800
There's another stop first,
if you don't mind.

389
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,086
Goodbye, Nimish.

390
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,320
ABHILASH: Ah!

391
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,244
- Your Highness.
- Welcome.

392
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
In this hand, I'm nothing but putty.

393
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,771
If you like it,
you should put a ring on it.

394
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,601
Uh...

395
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,962
Would you mind waiting?
I don't quite know how long I'll be.

396
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,044
Your command is my wish.

397
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,680
He will wait.

398
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,160
MADGE: Yes, but can you?

399
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,685
ABHILASH: Tough.

400
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,040
Break out the champagne!
Let the klaxons sound!

401
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,411
For home are the happy hunters and fat
is the lamb that we have slaughtered!

402
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
Namaste, Anokhi.

403
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,728
(BOTH SPEAKING HINDI)

404
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,200
- Namaste, madam.
- Namaste, Anokhi.

405
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,280
(SPEAKING HINDI)

406
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,283
How was America?

407
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,286
- It made death more tempting.
- (SUNAINA TRANSLATING)

408
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,360
Not bad biscuits, though.
I can't call them cookies.

409
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,045
Oh, look.

410
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,005
These are for your mother, apke ma.

411
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,491
These are for your father, apke pita.

412
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,520
- Hello, beta.
- Mummyji.

413
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,011
Come here.

414
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,160
I was just checking in a guest.

415
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,440
You scare the guests.

416
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,080
I'll do it.

417
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,760
She must be the reason
why things are going so smoothly.

418
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,288
It takes teamwork to make
a dream work, Mummyji.

419
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,205
Cousin Sapna.

420
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,809
And little Ranjan.

421
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,320
Thank you.

422
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
And there's more.

423
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
And breakfast is served on the terrace
between 7:00 and 10:00, Miss Beech.

424
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,080
With roll-call at 9:00 precisely.

425
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Roll-call?

426
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,960
To ensure that if anyone
has left us in the night,

427
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,122
at least they will not lie undiscovered.

428
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,200
Although you, dear lady, are nearer

429
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,806
the menopause than the mortuary.

430
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,650
Do fill in, please.

431
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,561
Hello?

432
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,161
Yes?

433
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,960
Oh, good morning.

434
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,201
Good morning.

435
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,080
Is this the Marigold Hotel?

436
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,800
Do you have a reservation?

437
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,040
- No, it seems great to me.
- I meant...

438
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,160
No, I know what you meant.

439
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,526
And, no, I don't have a booking.

440
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,320
Then you should plan your life
a little better. The last room's just going.

441
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,720
With great pride and joy I offer you
room 6, the jewel in our crown.

442
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,360
Overlooking the restaurant.

443
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,680
I was hoping for
somewhere quite private.

444
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
SONNY: Another new guest.

445
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,040
Like lemmings they come to the cliff edge
that is the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

446
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm so sorry, we're full up.

447
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,680
- That's disappointing.
- Mmm.

448
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,560
Fail to prepare, sir... prepare to fail.
I'm sorry, buddy.

449
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,160
Come, Miss Beech, your palace awaits.

450
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,680
I saw you at the airport, didn't I?

451
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,560
The man with only one bag.

452
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,246
GUY: Guy. Guy Chambers.

453
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,844
LAVINIA: Lavinia Beech.

454
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,331
The name again, please?

455
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,724
- Guy Chambers.
- (DROPS LUGGAGE)

456
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,280
Mr. Chambers. Forgive me for the cursory
nature of my greeting.

457
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,520
I am Sunil Indrajit Kapoor,
owner and proprietor

458
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,960
of this great and
sincerely profitable hotel.

459
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm pleased to meet you...

460
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,280
Of course we have our most
luxurious room available.

461
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,160
- We do?
- One to which I will personally escort you.

462
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
Don't you want to see my passport?

463
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,680
Ah, I know who you are, Mr. Chambers.

464
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,680
I know who he is.
Take Miss Beech to room 19.

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,720
Room 19 is not finished yet.

466
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,600
What can carpeting achieve
that a good pair of slippers cannot?

467
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,400
I'd really rather the room that I...

468
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,120
Please, Miss Beech, say it walking...

469
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,920
I don't mind what room I have, really.

470
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,600
But I mind, good sir. I mind deeply.

471
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,960
Sonny. A word.

472
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,520
In one hot minute, my darling.

473
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm just attending
to this most significant gentleman.

474
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,400
Now.

475
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,685
One moment.

476
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,600
What is your problem?
I have never seen such rudeness.

477
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,081
Bigger fish are frying, Sunaina.

478
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,080
Mr. Burley promised he would send
someone to evaluate the hotel.

479
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,400
You told me he'd send someone...

480
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,440
He said he'd send his guy.

481
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,840
His guy! You see?
He was sending me a message.

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
That's not much to go on.

483
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
Instinct, Sunaina.

484
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,160
Instinct is the nose of the mind.
And I have a large nose.

485
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,846
It goes well with my poppy-out ears.

486
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,722
MURIEL: Yeah, these aren't bad.

487
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,720
Not bad at all.

488
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,040
You're happy?

489
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,800
When have you seen me happy?

490
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,320
Good evening, Mrs. Donnelly.

491
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,000
Evening, Mrs. Greenslade.

492
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,920
We understand there
are grounds for optimism.

493
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,800
The boy did well.

494
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,360
And you? How did you find America?

495
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,840
I went with low expectations
and came back disappointed.

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
(CHUCKLES) Given your age,
I'm impressed you came back at all.

497
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,160
You're still standing, I see.

498
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,000
The old knee's hanging in there.

499
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,480
When's your next check-up?

500
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,000
Last week. And yours?

501
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Tomorrow. We'll see what's come loose.

502
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
Evening, all.

503
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,004
- Evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.
- Namaste.

504
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,160
Evening. Had a good day?

505
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,000
Wonderful. Spent every
second of it together.

506
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,880
Suffocating. Spent every
second of it together.

507
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,566
- He even followed me to the lavatory.
- (CHUCKLES)

508
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Everyone, this is Lavinia Beech.

509
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,600
- MADGE: Good evening.
- Hi.

510
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
You're a bit young, aren't you?

511
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,920
Well, I'm here for my mother.

512
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,320
Not that one needs an excuse
to escape the six weeks of warm rain

513
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,040
that constitute an English summer.
(LAUGHS)

514
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,841
She's thinking of coming for a longer stay.
I'm the advance party.

515
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,800
You must be hungry.
Please, come, sit down.

516
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,920
Not there, my darling. That is
the special table, already reserved.

517
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,525
For who?

518
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,280
Lordy lord, have mercy on my ovaries.

519
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,360
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen...

520
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,400
this is the great Guy Chambers.

521
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,643
As welcome as he is fragrant.

522
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
Hello.

523
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,560
MADGE: Hello.

524
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
Good to meet you all.

525
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,760
Perhaps tomorrow you will allow me to

526
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,049
take you on a tour of
our magnificent Pink City.

527
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,240
But now I shall
bring you food guaranteed

528
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,721
to tickle even your
most talented taste buds.

529
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Well, that was thorough.
Find any polyps up there?

530
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,360
He's the one.

531
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,480
What one?

532
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
Our evaluator.

533
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,920
Sent to decide if we are
to be franchise or footnote.

534
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,923
What's your evidence?

535
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,440
The nose knows, Mrs. Donnelly.

536
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,240
Oh, right. So that's bollocks, then.

537
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,450
I'm here writing a book,
as a matter of fact. A novel.

538
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,280
- That's a coincidence because I read novels.
- GUY: Oh.

539
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
Have you written others?

540
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,003
No. (CHUCKLES) No, this is my first.

541
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,280
It's just been kind
of a dream until now.

542
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,488
Any other dreams I can help you with?

543
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,921
NORMAN: So, what's it about?

544
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,927
It's about getting older, really.
And all that entails.

545
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,762
A sense of emptiness, of loss.
A gradual narrowing of one's...

546
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,809
Yes, well, you've come
to the right place for that.

547
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,800
Yes, yes. Now listen.
It's covered in scorpions.

548
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,400
How many tuk-tuks are there
with bloody scorpions on them?

549
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,211
And the driver is completely lethal.

550
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,800
Of course I don't know his name
but he's got one eye.

551
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
- There you are.
- Oh, my God.

552
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,169
Now listen, you. I don't want
any more excuses. Just do it!

553
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,486
(SCOFFS) That was the club.
There's been a power cut...

554
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,320
and apparently some of the food

555
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,920
for the party tonight
is slightly on the turn.

556
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
I'm sure you'll sort it, darling.

557
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
There's a problem with the party?

558
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
No, no problem with
the party, my darling.

559
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,489
Carol. Carol, where are you going?

560
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,240
To the travel agency where I work.

561
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
Why don't I walk with you?

562
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,840
No need. See you later.

563
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,321
Mrs. Hardcastle. Is there
a problem with the party?

564
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,400
Better not be.
It's the club's biggest night

565
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,528
for years. Can't afford slip-ups.

566
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,680
There was a power cut.

567
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,171
Norman.

568
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,200
- Douglas.
- Hello.

569
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
You missed roll-call.
I thought we'd lost you.

570
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,880
I was here early. Cyril's helping me.

571
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,360
I need to get all this sorted
for the wedding. I've got this whole...

572
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,560
bike thing planned.

573
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,400
Turns out, it wasn't
a piston problem at all.

574
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Something to do with
the carburetor. So...

575
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,400
- (LAUGHING)
- You don't care, do you?

576
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,600
Only insomuch as it matters to you.

577
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,569
But still you came.

578
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,920
Listen. I'm going to Mumbai
in a couple of days.

579
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,240
I know, for Laura's conference.

580
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,528
I was thinking, why don't you come?

581
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,611
She's my daughter,
I'd like you to meet her.

582
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,360
Of course. But I'm not sure
I can make a trip like that.

583
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,760
Silly idea.

584
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,200
With the new job and everything.
I shouldn't even be going myself.

585
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,960
Plenty of tours to fail to guide...

586
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,600
and the bike still isn't finished.

587
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,800
I would love to meet her.

588
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,246
It'll happen.

589
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,040
Oh... will I see you tonight?

590
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,800
- What?
- The engagement party.

591
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,600
DOUGLAS: Absolutely. I wouldn't miss it.

592
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
EVELYN: Wonderful.

593
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,649
- Bye.
- Bye.

594
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,683
You should marry that girl.

595
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
I want to.

596
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,960
(MRS. KAPOOR AND ANOKHI SPEAKING HINDI)

597
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,929
Where's our new guest?

598
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Which one?

599
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,646
The American...

600
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,288
I didn't see him at breakfast...

601
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,281
(BOTH SPEAKING HINDI)

602
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,520
Good morning.

603
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,681
Ah.

604
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,960
The man with no plan
who still gets the best room.

605
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
I felt really bad about that.

606
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
Not bad enough to swap with her.

607
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,408
No, I did swap. After dinner last night.

608
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,400
So how's the new room?

609
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,961
Monastic. Which I prefer.

610
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,200
No need to tell
the proprietor about this.

611
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,840
He's not the fastest fox in the forest.

612
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,850
He's my son.

613
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,560
GUY: And a fine fellow he is.
You must be very proud.

614
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,520
Don't speak to the guests, Mummyji.

615
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,960
Mr. Chambers was just telling me

616
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,361
how comfortable he is at the hotel.

617
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,169
I'm both delighted and unsurprised.
But really, no speaking.

618
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,883
Hope to see you again.

619
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,889
Go on, Mummyji. (CLEARS THROAT)

620
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,720
And now, good sir, for our tour.

621
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Let us find Vikram and
his beautiful minibus,

622
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,960
and taste the pleasures
of our fine city.

623
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,920
Could I come along? I was just
about to brave the city on my own.

624
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,600
Madam, this perfect specimen and I

625
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,680
were planning to spend
the day alone together.

626
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,200
- I didn't mean to intrude.
- Of course she can come.

627
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,930
Of course you can come.

628
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,044
MADGE: It's difficult.

629
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Every morning I take a taxi
to the roundabout and I have a decision.

630
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,720
I can either go left to Nimish...

631
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,967
or right to Abhilash.
Both of whom love me.

632
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,210
I'm pretty sure they're going
to propose soon enough.

633
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,360
Just because I'm looking
at you when you talk,

634
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,640
don't think I'm interested or listening.

635
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,280
Thing is, I don't
know who to say "yes" to.

636
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,566
MURIEL: Well...

637
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,640
No, I don't care.

638
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,325
MALE DOCTOR: Mrs. Donnelly?

639
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,402
The fun just never starts.

641
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,681
SONNY: ...who gave us our name
and protected us with his six noble gates.

642
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,960
Patterned our concourse with boulevards

643
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,522
of generous proportion
and exquisite grace.

644
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,121
(SPEAKING HINDI)

645
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,280
SONNY: ...and crowned
his achievement with

646
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,886
the magnificence that is the Hawa Mahal.

647
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,525
The Palace Of The Winds.

648
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,680
GUY: This is the palace?

649
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,049
This is the Supreme Quality Hotel.

650
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,280
Well played indeed, my friend.

651
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,760
Your eye does not flicker and the cards

652
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,160
stay close to your noble chest.

653
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,920
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why are we here?

654
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,321
Let us look around and you will see.

655
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,520
Please, come. Come, come, come.

656
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,640
Clearly whoever named this establishment
had a sense of mischief.

657
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,240
But had he named it
the Supreme Potential Hotel...

658
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,085
then, my friends, we would be talking.

659
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,840
I wanted to ask you about your mother.

660
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,120
I can only apologize.

661
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,520
Here is our planned
installation of an elevator.

662
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,280
Easy access for the elderly to the higher
floors before they make the...

663
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,040
greatest climb of all.

664
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,880
And from here to the hospital it is
but a short walk or a stretcher ride.

665
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,000
What about your father? Where is he?

666
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,600
- Scattered on holy waters.
- Sorry.

667
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,840
Finding, at last, the peace my mother
denied him while he lived.

668
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,764
Why, why do you ask?

669
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,526
I don't know, I'm just
really struck by her.

670
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
By whom?

671
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,401
I'm sorry?

672
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,040
By whom were you struck?

673
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,531
By your mother.

674
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,160
My mother?

675
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,360
Your mother, yeah.

676
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,760
Sorry to butt in, could I just...

677
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,520
- My mother?
- Your mother.

678
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,040
Do you own this place?

679
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,480
Yes.

680
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,760
It is the most recent addition
to our burgeoning empire.

681
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,922
Not the last time I looked.

682
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,521
SONNY: Kushal?

683
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,404
To what do we owe this... pain?

684
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,924
Funny guy.

685
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Kushal Kadania.

686
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,680
Hi. Guy Chambers.

687
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,800
- Lavinia Beech.
- Great pleasure.

688
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,480
Why are you here, Kushal?
And please explain the hat.

689
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,325
So what do you think?
You like the place?

690
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,440
I think it could be
really great. Yes, I do.

691
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,080
How clever of Sonny to buy it.

692
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,600
Except he didn't buy it.

ever caught your name.

do your dance?

ever gets here for the rehearsal.

the Supreme Quality Hotel.

- Had you made an offer on it?
- We don't have the money yet.

729
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,640
Then how did he cheat you?

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,240
You think he didn't know
we were planning to buy it?

731
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,480
Sonny. The place has been
on the market for over a year.

732
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,680
- I saw it, I contacted my investor.
- Your father.

733
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,440
And my investor agreed that we should
make a move before the price went up.

- You still have to rehearse.

I'm going anyway.

866
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,285

that the difference between...

what we want and what we fear...

871
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,807
is the width of an eyelash.

872
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,486
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

873
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,680
Oh, the hearing's gone then, obviously.

874
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,286
Yeah, along with your backbone.

875
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,520
I don't know why I tell you anything.

876
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,880
Because I'm older and wiser.

877
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,640
19 days older.

878
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,043
That's the entire lifespan of a wasp.

879
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,485
(SOFTLY) Go on, talk to him.

880
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,526
Look, we don't have to dance.
We could just talk.

881
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,005
Well, we start by you telling me
what your name is.

882
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,204
It's Mrs. Kapoor.

883
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,881
That's all I get?

884
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,000
Mmm-hmm. That's all you get.

885
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,200
Huh. Alright, um...

886
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,361
Um...

887
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,520
Okay, I'm 64. I am single...

888
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,766
and my wife left me a couple
of years ago. I don't know why.

889
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,485
Uh, I'm generally kinder
to people than to animals.

890
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,120
Not that I'm mean to animals, I'm not.

891
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,400
I like animals. Especially dogs.

892
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,400
What do you want from me?

893
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,245
I don't know, just a little
back and forth. A little...

894
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,963
I went, now you go.

895
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,480
What do you really want?

896
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,801
(CHUCKLES) I don't know.

898
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,720
I prefer cats.

899
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,564

900
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,524
Have dinner with me.

901
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,204
Whenever you want.

902
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,880
We can go tomorrow night.
Night after that. That's...

903
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,566
Or I could book a table right here,
if you want?

904

You think I'd organize a power cut?

923
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,531
The only thing you did organize.

924
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,040
I had more important things to see to.

925
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,920
What is more important
than your engagement?

926
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,520
If I could see where
your leg is, I'd kick it.

could stay on the floor with your Kushti.

better than me.

Oh.

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,240
But I was wondering...

947
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,246
I mean I was thinking that
when you come for the conference...

948
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,280
we could...

I'm going to be there

would have been nice.

she'd been offered

two return flights,
first class, of course...

Daniel Green. He's a country solicitor.
And my boyfriend.

972
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,921
It was actually his idea that I come
and speak about this in person.

00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,080
The Supreme Quality, was that the name?

1040
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,320
I don't recall.

1041
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,280
Kushal thought the lift might be

1042
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,240
rather a bonus for my darling mum.

1043
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,920
Six stairs without a rest
is about all she can manage now.

1044
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,400
Maybe we should take another look.

1045
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,404
And also because the new proprietor
is quite handsome. (LAUGHS)

1046
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,762
Truly, madam, you're on fire today.

1047
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,280
Can't you make this thing go any faster?

1048
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,920
My pedal is to the metal, boss.

1049
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,766
Look, I'll give you everything in my wallet.
I'll give you my wallet.

1050
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,931
Okay. Then let's go through the floor.

1051

1052
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,720
I'm sorry, what?

1053
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,600
Uh, when we reach the turning,

1054
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,604
with which gentleman do you
wish to spend your time?

1055
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,490
Oh, um, left.

1056
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,802
How's your niece doing?

1057
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,282
She's bored and frustrated.

1058
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
Her first question to the doctor

1059
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,480
was whether she would
still be able to dance.

1060
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,640
Is she good?

1061
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,121
She makes movement into magic.

1062
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,480
You have no children yourself?

1063
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,969
I did not marry, madam.

1064
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,482
I just never fell in love.

1065
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,529
Didn't stop me.

1066
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,526
Stop here!

1067

Hey, wait! Wait!

1068
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,920
Listen. Whatever I said to you the other
night, you have got to forget it.

1069
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,686
Oh, my very generous friend!

1070
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,206
No, no. The deal is off.
Do you understand?

1071
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,360
It is over!

1072
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,206
You want to do a deal with me?
We can do deal, sir.

- ASSISTANT: Very clear, Uncle.

1083
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,000
- DOUGLAS: Are you sure?
- ASSISTANT: Very sure, Uncle.

1084
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,360
DOUGLAS: We're not messing this up.

1085
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,760
ASSISTANT: Categorically not.

1086
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,130
Because this is showtime.
So, let's run through it again.

in the garden and I'll dictate to you...

that your mind is empty.

1089
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,446
Good. And when your friends
invite you to play with them?

1090
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,800
I'll tell them where
to stick their ball.

1091
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,160

I was too exhausted

1092
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,480
to do much tourism the first time.

Tired all day and awake all night. (LAUGHS)

1094

Now I sleep wonderfully.

1095
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,680
Although one does rather miss a rose
on one's pillow in the morning.

1096

Have you met Daniel?

1097
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,800
Mum keeps promising.

1098
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,040
I'm saving him up.

1099
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,000
Have you thought about
our conversation last night?

1100
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,280
Which option are you plumping for?

1101
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,480
The thing is...

1102
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,240
as I recall, you deserted me

1103
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,360
and I'm not sure I was
entirely unreasonable.

1104
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,080
It'll have to be adultery, then.

That's a sorry state of affairs.

Is that why she left so suddenly?

Oh, look, there's your fan club.

1112
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,484
I think she actually went
to start her new job.

This is a process that takes many weeks

1116
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,840
and involves 12 separate dyes...

1117
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,560
to produce the finished product.

1118
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,200
The intricate patterns require
40 passes over the cloth...

1119
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,360
and each pass involves
the entire length of the table.

1120
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,480
There are 8 tables in
this room and 24 in all.

We will process around
2,000 meters of cloth in a day.

and thinks he can charge us double.

I cannot go below 50,000 per crate.

1130
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,560
My costs will not permit it.

1131
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,000
EVELYN: 30 really is
the most we can offer.

1132
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,240
I'm not sure you understand
the work involved.

1133
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,560
I understand perfectly,
but 30 is our limit.

1134
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,840

this negotiation himself.

1138
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,120
Of course.

because it's her...

You think because
you're with this white woman...

that you've climbed a treetop?

is going to fluster me?

Don't talk rubbish!

01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,404
maybe it's about the beginning of them.

1209
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,249
It's about a man who...

1210
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,720
whose life has fallen apart...

1211
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,360
and he's done what people do
when they've been bruised.

1212
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,091
He circles the wagons, he shuts down.

1213
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,045
But now he's, he's come
somewhere very far away and...

1214
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,369
suddenly he's awake.

1215
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,562
His blood is moving. He's...

1216
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,403
It's the place,
it's the extraordinary place.

1217
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,004
But mostly...

1218
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,524
it's this person that he's met there.

1219
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,884
And how does...

1220
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,569
How does she feel?

1221

1222
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,720
Well, she doesn't know.
Not immediately, of course not.

1223
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,884
That would be kind of
a short story if she did.

1224
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,521
I think that she's scared.

1225
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,440
And I'm sure that she was an incredibly...
beautiful young woman...

1226
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,286
and she knows she's not that young anymore.
Although to him...

1227
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,202
to him she looks wonderful.

1228
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,725
But she wouldn't trust him
if he said that, so...

1229
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,202
Actually, I don't think
she trusts anybody, really.

1230
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,765
Least of all herself, which is probably
a sign that she's become...

1231
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,127
become someone who she
doesn't really wanna be.

1232
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,722
And every day that goes by
makes it harder to remember...

1233
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,480
that she once was passionate, willful.

1234
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,486
She disapproves of those things.
Now she fears them.

1235
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,481
Which is why he's not pushing.

1236
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,604
For now...

1237
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,842
For now he just wants
an evening with her.

1238
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,930

1239
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,922

1240
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,044

I cannot bear and that's self-pity.

1377
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,004
Um, darling...

1378
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,601
What?

1379
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,160
I went to look for a friend last night.

1380
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,520
Evelyn. Yes.
I was hoping to meet her properly.

1381
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,603
- She checked out.
- As in...

1382
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,480
I think she went back to Jaipur.

1383
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,484
Then what are you waiting for?

1384
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,640
But I'm here.
I came here to see your speech.

1385
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,640
Oh, bollocks to that!

1386
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,007
You wouldn't understand a word.

1387
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,721
Dad.

1388
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,400
You've spent your life seeking out people
who can stop you being happy.

1389
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,963
Doing the things you want to do.
Don't put that on me too.

1390
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,883
Don't make me even more
like mum than I am already.

1391
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,723
You have all the good bits,
all the brilliant bits.

1392
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,321
Go on.

1393
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,166
I'll make it alright with her. Go.

1394
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,521
Yes.

1395
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,964
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1396
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,040
MADGE: I've bought
a present for your niece.

1397
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,760
Something from the market.
I hope that's alright.

1398
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,120
BABUL: Much more than alright.

1399
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,480
Good. Will you give it to her?

1400
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,324
Of course.

1401
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,484
Actually, wait a minute.
Which way is your house?

1402
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,731
This way.

1403
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,880
She's my sister.

1404
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,000
Namaste.

1405
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,160
My brother. My cousin sisters.

1406
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,280
Namaste.

1407
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,640
My cousin brothers. And 3 of my friends.

1408
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,200
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

1409
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,200
- My uncle.
- Namaste.

1410
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,440
- My auntie.
- Namaste.

1411
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,601
And, uh...

1412
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,084
Hello, darling.

1413

(BOTH SPEAKING HINDI)

1414
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,720
She still wants to read your book.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1416
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,560
Your uncle told me
how very brave you're being...

1417
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,160
and I thought you deserved a reward.

1418
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,483
(SPEAKING HINDI)

1419
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,880
What you do is wind her up like this.

1420
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,964
And then, very gently...

1421
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,204
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

1422
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,360
(SIGHS)

1423
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,921
That was me when I was her age.

1424
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,010
Twirling away.

1425
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,683
I wasn't bad, I don't think,
but I gave it up.

1426
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,047
Just like most things in my life.

1427
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,489
- Which is your house?
- Uh...

1428
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,201
White house. I was born there.

1429
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,331
So was she and her sisters.
My sister. My whole family.

1430
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,726
What a lovely place to have lived.

1431
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,163
I'm very happy you came.

1432
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,480
So... what happened last night?
You left in a hurry.

1433
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,000
I went to talk to the inspector.

1434
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,400
And?

1435
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,000
His mind was on other matters.

1436
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,481
Because he's not the inspector.

1437
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,160
No, Lavinia Beech is. Except her name's

1438
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,360
not Lavinia and she's American.

1439
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,120
And you've done nothing but show her

1440
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,320
the back of your hand
since she got here.

1441
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,320
That is absolutely not true.

1442
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,080
My God, that is true.

1443
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,440
Excuse me.

1444
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,080
Ah, Miss... Miss... Miss...

1445
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,681
Miss...

1446
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,760
- Beech.
- Miss Beech. How delightful to see you.

1447
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,080
Might I ask most humbly
if you have plans

1448
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,440
for today and, if so,
can I feature in them?

1449
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,000
I was actually just
on my way to see Kushal.

1450
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,760
And is that, if so bold I might be,

1451
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,520
for the purposes of
business or pleasure?

1452
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,960
Both, really.

1453
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,520
No offense, but I think in the end

1454
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,400
the Supreme Quality will
just suit my mother perfectly.

1455
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,800
Please, madam, I'll give you
a better room. One that's finished.

1456
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,040
Sonny. I heard you were looking for me?

1457
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,960
Room 6 will shortly be available.

1458
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,440
- I'm in room 6.
- You are? She is?

1459
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,680
A lot's been going on.

1460
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,285
I'm sorry, no.

1461
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
So, Mr. Chambers.

1462
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,200
Could you hold on a sec, Miss Beech?

1463
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,567
The great Mr. Chambers.

1464
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,560
The great writer Mr. Chambers.

1465
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,645
- Sure, if you like.
- I do not like, sir. I do not like one bit!

1466
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,720
What did you wanna tell me?

1467
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,804
To leave this hotel and never darken
its towels again.

1468
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,240
- You lied, sir.
- He did not lie.

1469
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,480
You pretended not to be
something you weren't.

1470
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,645
There was an inspector.
It just wasn't him. It was that one.

1471
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,160
Lavinia. Except that's
not your name, is it?

1472
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,085
(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
No. My name's Theresa.

1473
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,120
I knew that I knew you.
You work for the competition.

1474
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,240
- "Golden Years," right?
- Correct.

1475
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,080
How did you know that?

1476
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,004
It's his business to know.

1477
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,006
And ours to know what he's up to.

1478
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,169
Please explain.

1479
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,528
She is a hotel inspector. Just not
the one that they were worried about.

1480
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,284
That would be me.

1481
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,530
I told you.

1482
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,884
The nose knew.

1483
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,320
While there are patterns we can study...

1484
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,800
to mitigate the amplitude
of the extreme highs and lows...

1485
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,560
that characterize any entrepreneurial
journey, they'll come anyway.

(ALL LAUGHING)

1487
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,849
But don't let that stop you
because the highs...

1488
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,720
like being here today with you all,
make everything worthwhile.

1489
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,320
Just get in the game.
I'll see you in the bar. Thank you.

1490

They were riveted.

1492
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,680
Riveted, they were. No, really.

1493
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,205
Thank you.

1494
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,760
Laura's success continues, evidently.

1495
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,800
Yes, I'm very proud of her.

1496
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,884
It's a shame Douglas
couldn't be here to enjoy it.

1497
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,607
What exactly is your job here?

1498
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,600
Sourcing fabrics and liaising between

1499
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,560
the merchants and
the company I work for.

1500
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,480
Ooh, doesn't that
just trip off the tongue.

1501
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,360
Oh, it's easier to say than to do.

1502
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,921
Well, you look as if you're handling it.

1503
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,288
I must say, I admire
what you've made of yourself here.

1504
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,565
Thank you.

1505
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,200
There's only one thing puzzling me.

1506
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,684
Douglas pleaded not guilty to adultery.
Why would that be?

1507
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,880
Do you not fancy him?

1508
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,880
Even when I could hardly stand the man,

1509
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,800
I still found him rather attractive.

1510
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,120
In some ways rather more so than Daniel.

1511
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,640
Well, Douglas has one great advantage

1512
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,565
over Daniel which is
that he actually exists.

1513
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,964
Daniel exists.

1514
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,566
- He does.
- Oh, if you say so.

1515
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,520
I work in his office.

1516
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,240
I've started doing clerical stuff,
Tuesdays and Thursdays...

1517
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,801
just to keep the ends meeting.

1518
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,121
Money doesn't stretch as far
in Reigate as in Rajasthan.

1519
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,760
Daniel knows my name,
of course, we're a small team.

1520
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,571
But he hasn't proposed,
I grant you that.

1521
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,120
That's why I want the divorce.

1522
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,649
I can hardly expect a man to want
to go out with me while I'm still married.

1523
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,363
What do you suppose
we should do for our first date?

1524
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,520
I'm too embarrassed to ask Laura.

1525
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:22,401
A film? A shared experience.
Something to talk about afterwards.

1526
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,640
Which will prevent
any possible awkwardness.

1527
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,360
Oh, there won't be any awkwardness.

1528
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,887
No, I don't suppose there will be.

1529
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:36,128
There are some people into whose laps
the good things in life fall.

1530
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,923
I'm not one of them.

1531
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,965
Coming out here finally taught me that.

1532
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,040
So, if the good things
won't come on their own,

1533
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,850
I must make them.

1534
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,966
And that's what I intend to do.

1535
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,606

and now they can...

1536
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,480

01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,881
have given them roots and now...

1539
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,120
- Sunaina?
- You can't come in.

1540
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,440
I don't want you to see
the dress until Friday.

1541
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,960
I need my clipboard.

1542
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,440
You know the names of the guests.
Why do you need a clipboard?

1543
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,921
It's just an excuse to come in.

1544
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,680
I must apologize to you.

1545
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,000
You apologized already.

1546
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,003
I mean it more now.

1547
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,842
And I promise you three things.

1548
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,925
I promise I will properly rehearse
the wedding dance.

1549
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:58,000
I promise I'll wear the turban
your mother chose for the ceremony.

1550
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:01,160
And I promise I'll be a better
husband than fiancé.

1551
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,688
Good... because
you're a terrible fiancé.

1552
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,490
Listen to me.

1553
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,800
If there is ever a time
in our life together when...

1554
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,760
I find myself attracted to another man

1555
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,680
or even confused a little,
I will always tell you.

1556
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,287
And that way, you know that
I will never, ever act on it.

1557
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,881
I don't find Kush attractive.

1558
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,840
His ears are too close to his head.

1559
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,564
I hoped you would find
his offer of a partnership...

1560
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,084
more attractive.

1561
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,723
But that is up to you.

1562
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,360
- Have you seen my other shoe, darling?
- Hmm?

1563
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,160
If you don't tell me what's been
the problem for the last few days,

1564
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,720
I'll need it to kick you with.

1565
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,928
Your shoe's under the bed.

1566
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,520
And you're having an affair.

1567
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,160
Oh, so it is. Wonderful.

1568
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,600
I said I know you're sleeping
with someone else.

1569
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,920
Of course I am, darling. Aren't you?

1570
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,440
What about that twitchy
little witch at the club? Susan.

1571
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,840
Obviously you've both been at it
like rabbits for weeks now.

1572
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,760
No. I mean no!

1573
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,600
Well, why not? What's been stopping you?

1574
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,285
Well, you have.

1575
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,201
What?

1576
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,600
That's not fair.

1577
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,520
Do you mean I didn't need to be
carrying on with any of these men?

1578
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,760
There's more than one?

1579
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,240
I am only out there
because I thought you were.

1580
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,610
Look, I'm not "out" at all.
I couldn't be more "in."

1581
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,201
You know, when we met...

1582
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,760
you said you were lonely.

1583
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,242
I was. It doesn't mean I was celibate.

1584
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,806
I don't want to be
that lonely again, Norman.

1585
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,720

Cousins and Miss Carol Parr.

1593

Just about.

1595

Learning my speech.

1596
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,600
A couple of days, I'll be fine.

1598
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,640
Not back yet. Which is a surprise.

Mr. Guy Chambers.

1600
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,644

my good wishes or not...

1601
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,126
you'll have them on your wedding day.

1602
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,005
Thank you.

1603
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,205
I don't care what you are.
I still would.

1604
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,764
How will you rate us?

1605
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,041
Not that it matters now, but...

1606
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,403
what will the report say?

1607
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,050
Shall I be frank?

1608
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,205
A welcome change.

1609
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,080
To say that...

1610
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,560
there is huge room for improvement
in the running of this hotel...

1611
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,760
would be to understate the surreally

1612
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,764
haphazard nature of your operation.

1613
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,362
Thank you... for your feedback.

1614
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,600
But the fact that
you get away with it...

1615
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,886
(SCOFFS)

1616
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,202
I mean, it's a testament to the...

1617
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,080
to the reservoirs of affection

1618
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,210
in which you're held
by the residents here.

1619
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,720
No-one can put a price on that.

1620
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,406
So, I would have said...

1621
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,080
that with a new and better-equipped
facility like the Supreme Quality...

1622
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,600
you would have had my endorsement.

1623
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,091
Would have?

1624
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,489
Well, I'm resigning.
My position is totally compromised here.

1625
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,160
I see.

1626
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,880
But you've got another inspector
right here.

1627
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,760
I don't like the people she works for
but if that's the only game in town...

1628
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,480
We've spoken already.

1629
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,280
Her recommendation is also based upon

1630
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,091
the acquisition of
the Supreme Quality Hotel.

1631
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,801
Why don't you just do a deal with him?

1632
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,963
If only for the sake
of your beautiful bride.

1633
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,320
Right, well I'll be, I'll be staying

1634
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,689
at the Viceroy until my plane leaves.

1635
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,842
Could you... Would you please
tell your mother...

1636
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,484
Would you please tell her
that I'm quitting my job?

1637
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,883
What are you going to do?

1638
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,924
Write my book.

1639
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,408
She knows the story.

1640
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,450
Mr. Chambers.

1641
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,604
Allow me to offer you
a lift to the Viceroy Club.

1642
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,287
Vikram's beautiful minibus awaits.

1643
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,201
Please.

1644
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,321
Good.

1645
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,765
Careful. You'll never get back up again.

1646
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,200
Well, you're still in one
slightly sagging piece, I see.

1647
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,880
Barely. The plane was diverted
just before landing.

1648
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,568
A cow on the runway. Not exactly
the way I always wanted to go.

1649
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,200
Death by cow.

1650
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:11,320
I suppose it would make people
sit up and take notice.

1651
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,320
Yeah, I wouldn't want that.

1652
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:18,088
I'd like everyone to turn around
one day and realize I've already gone.

1653
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,282
Tell me about Mumbai.
Did you find your spine?

1654
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,123
Well, I'm taking the job.

1655
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,080
I thought I wouldn't. I thought...

1656
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,720
"How many new lives can we have?"

1657
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,488
And then I thought, "As many as we like."
While we can.

Be a lot of traveling.

1659

How else could I come home afterwards?

1660
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,483
You'd be missed.

1661

You do know that? You must know that.

1662
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,968
Anyway, Mrs. Greenslade,
the wedding is nearly upon us.

1663
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,120
You got your glad rags ready?

1664
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,089
I'm a bit nervous, actually.

1665
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,050
It's a big day.

1666
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,044
For all of us.

1667
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:26,844
MURIEL: I never understood why anyone
would want to get married.

1668
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,367
I barely found a bugger
I could spend a week with...

1676
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:13,725
So you'll have to make do
with this letter instead.

I do opinions.

1681

And my opinion of the groom is this:

1682
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,122
he gets plenty wrong...

1683
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,846
but never when it counts.

01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,045
