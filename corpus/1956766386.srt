1
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,387
- Can I get your cab, sir?
- No.

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,389
- Can I help you with your bag?
- I said no.

3
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,257
No is no.
Don't touch the bag.

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,259
Well, a very merry Christmas
to you, too, sir.

5
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,495
Yeah.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,696
Hey, come back here.

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,100
You know what?
You're right.

8
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,237
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, sir.

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,572
All right,
now get out of my face.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,541
- Oh.
- Go ahead.

11
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,420
Sir.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,489
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?

13
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,325
Yes, you can.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,162
- This car won't do.
- This is a good car.

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,432
- It's very fast.
- I need a bigger trunk.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,702
So what's it gonna be?
You coming to the party?

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,305
Well, I'd love to,
but you know I'm here
on business.

18
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,574
I'll see you soon.

19
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:18,244
Bye, girls.
All right, yo.

20
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,447
Let's go, ladies' man.
Murray's waiting.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,482
Can't be late for the job.

22
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:38,932
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way ♪

23
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:43,536
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in an one-horse open sleigh ♪

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,371
♪ Jingle bells,
jingle bells... ♪

25
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,308
Woman:
So Mr. Crown invites
all the employees.

26
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,909
- Woman #2:
Well,
 when you own the casino...
-
Right, yeah.

27
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,646
I said Virgin Mary
extra spicy.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,315
Yes, sir. Sorry.

29
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,722
Here you go, folks.
Compliments of Murray Crown.

30
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,458
Yeah.
No, flight was okay.

31
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,727
No, no.
Not too bumpy.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,262
So how are the kids?

33
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,231
Yeah, what'd he do?

34
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,932
Yeah, well, you tell him
if he doesn't want coal
in his stocking

35
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,968
and a rap on his head,
he better start listening.

36
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,439
And your names are...

37
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,541
Mistletoe.
This is Zuzu.

38
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,811
Ah, I'm Joey.
Merry Christmas.

39
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,614
So, uh, have you been
good girls this year?

40
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,416
No, we've been
very naughty.

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,221
Naughty's nice.

42
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,224
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Thanks for throwing the party,
 Mr. Crown.

43
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,860
Tell the boss what you want
for Christmas, sweet cakes.

44
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,596
- Can I tell you in private?
- Would you, please?

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,732
Murray.

46
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,700
- Oh!
- Run along, sweetheart.

47
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,336
Only Mommy kisses
Santa Claus this year.

48
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,908
Okay, go find
something else.
Go on.

49
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,810
- Oh. They're here.
- Oh.

50
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,484
Humbug.

51
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,588
Humbug is right.

52
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,622
Yeah, what can I tell you,
Charley?

53
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,424
I tried to do
what I could,

54
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,460
but we both know
who the real Scrooge
is around here.

55
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,995
Yeah, Murray Crown.

56
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,897
Hello, Murray.

57
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,000
- Hey.
- And, Shirley,

58
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,536
can I just say
how beautiful you
look this evening?

59
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,872
Well, why not?
You'd only be
telling the truth.

60
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,044
Leo, let me buy you
a glass of eggnog, okay?

61
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,645
Okay.

62
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,482
- We had a good year.
- A great year.

63
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,652
- A banner year.
- And a lot of the credit
 goes to you.

64
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,323
- Ah.
- Seriously, you are my oldest
 and most trusted friend.

65
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,958
And because of that,

66
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,993
I've got a little bit
of holiday cheer

67
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,562
from me to you.

68
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,733
Murray, I don't know
what to say.

69
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,702
And that ain't all,
as an added bonus,

70
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,071
this is Sindy
with an S.

71
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,607
- Okay, you'll need this.
- Oh, Murray.

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,543
Now, Sindy,
he's got a weak heart,
so first couple rounds,

73
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,411
take a little something off
of it, all right?

74
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,779
- I'll take care of him.
- Merry Christmas, Leo.

75
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,790
- All right, I got to go.
- Oh, no.

76
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,626
- Yeah.
- You sure?

77
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,795
- To remember me by.
- Merry Christmas.
 Merry Christmas.

78
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,737
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

79
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,006
- What?
- Come on.

80
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,990
Hope you don't mind,
I ordered champagne
and caviar.

81
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,860
Why would I mind?
It's Murray's dime.

82
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,574
So which one
of you's caviar?

83
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,448
Little joke.
Tough room.

84
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,550
So what can I do
for you fellas?

85
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,018
Murray sent us.

86
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,921
Yeah, well, no offense,
but I gotta tell ya,

87
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,557
I much preferred
the lovely Sindy
with an S.

88
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,393
- Where is he?
- Who?

89
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,529
- The little drummer boy.
- Marley.

90
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,898
The yutz from the lounge?

91
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,600
But-- what's the matter,
he didn't show up
for work tonight?

92
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,736
No, Leo,
he didn't.

93
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,639
And last night,
he telephoned Murray.

94
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,607
Said he had information

95
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,644
about the casino's
financial shenanigans
over the past few years.

96
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,913
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,049
He also said
if Murray didn't
come up with $125,000,

98
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,518
he was gonna feed
that info to the feds.

99
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,654
Which wouldn't be good
for Murray.

100
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,956
And either way,
it definitely ain't good
for you, buttercup,

101
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,459
'cause Murray knows
that information could
only come from you.

102
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,195
Look, on my mother's--

103
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,163
I don't know what
you're talking about.

104
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,898
I swear.

105
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,968
I'm sorry.
It's--

106
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,138
I've got to warn you,
I'm extremely ticklish.

107
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,973
Yeah, come on.

108
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,809
Oh, no.
No, what are you
gonna do to me?

109
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,945
Leo, it's Christmas,
better it be a surprise.

110
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,014
But I can tell you
this much, you really
ain't gonna like it.

111
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,051
No! Help!
Oh!

112
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,622
Is this funny to you?

113
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,491
No, I'm sorry, fellas.

114
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,062
When I'm nervous,
I have a tendency
to make jokes.

115
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,899
Yeah, but, see,
that wasn't a joke, Leo.

116
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,668
A joke is a guy walks
into a bar.

117
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,037
A joke is this guy
and Cindy Crawford

118
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,906
were stranded
on a desert island.

119
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,841
- I didn't know that one.
-
You don't know that one?

120
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,110
It's a classic.
George, you know
that one, yeah?

121
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,479
Hey, I got one.

122
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,648
And I think
you're gonna like--

123
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,658
What?!
Did he just die?!

124
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,728
- What the--
 see if he's dead.
- Wait, why me?

125
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,230
What, afraid of
a little dead body?

126
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,748
Yup. He's dead.

127
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,786
I don't care how it happened.
Get rid of the body and
you find the drummer.

128
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,289
And do it now, okay?

129
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,525
Hi. Happy holidays.
Happy holidays.
Good luck.

130
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,494
Good luck.
Happy holidays
to you guys.

131
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,700
How are we gonna find
the drummer now?

132
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,770
And to think
right now I could be
under Mistletoe.

133
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,574
What the hell's that?

134
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,244
- It's a falling star.
- You mean a meteor.

135
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,014
- A what?
- That's what we call
 falling stars, meteors.

136
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,050
Burning up
as they're entering
Earth's atmosphere.

137
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,252
It could be
a flying saucer.

138
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,321
I hear they use the desert
out here as a landing strip.

139
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,290
Whatever it is,
here it comes.

140
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,298
Man on P.A.:
Attention, you have entered
a restricted military zone.

141
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,834
Leave the area immediately.

142
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,203
Come on, let's go. Go!

143
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,073
Come on, Joey.
Close it, come on.

144
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,541
Come on,
let's go.

145
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,244
Move it!

146
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,999
- Okay, I think we're clear.
- All right.

147
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,700
You can turn
the headlights on now.
Come on.

148
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,972
Both:
George, look out!

149
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,707
Joey:
Look out, George!
Look out!

150
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,249
George!

151
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,798
Are you okay?

152
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,233
Somebody could've
been killed.

153
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,268
Somebody still might be.

154
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,637
I'm sorry.
My car overheated

155
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,339
and my cell phone
doesn't work

156
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,975
and I ran out of water
and if you hadn't stopped--

157
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,781
- Hey, why you crying?
- It's not her fault.

158
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,917
She's just experiencing
a little hormonal imbalance.

159
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,852
Perfectly natural
after the sixth month,
right, honey?

160
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,322
Thank you.

161
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,124
Do you have children?

162
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,993
Yes, I have five.

163
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,796
We're shooting for six.
So when are you due, hon?

164
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,731
Next month.

165
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,100
I was hoping for
a Christmas baby, but...

166
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,869
- Eh, as long as
 they're healthy, right?
- Right.

167
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,738
Hey, I don't mean
to interrupt this
Kodak moment,

168
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,740
but what are you
doing out here?

169
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,176
My radiator is shot.

170
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,845
Yeah, and thanks to you,
so is our battery.

171
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,781
Guys, she's freaking right
about these cell phones.

172
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,290
May I?

173
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,205
So what are you doing out here
in the middle of nowhere?

174
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,208
Well, my husband
is at Camp MacArthur

175
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,710
and I was on my way
to see him.

176
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,112
So you're married.

177
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,316
Yes.

178
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,084
So where's
your wedding ring?

179
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,457
I had to hock it.

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,227
Now I have a baby
on the way.

181
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,131
You got a real way
with the ladies, huh?

182
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,999
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,934
So what's your name,
hon?

184
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,237
Mary.

185
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,072
Mary Ann Davidson.

186
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,875
Mary Ann Davidson.
Where you from?

187
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,278
Do you know
Sweetwater, Iowa?

188
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,447
Sweetwater? No.

189
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,883
That's where I'm from.

190
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,484
I ran away
to make it big
on the Strip.

191
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,154
You know,
name in lights,
star on the door.

192
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,323
What I got was a job
selling watered-down drinks

193
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,993
to insurance salesmen
from Cheboygan.

194
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,896
And now you're pregnant.

195
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,999
Yeah.

196
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,302
So you gonna
raise the kid
in Vegas?

197
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,472
I don't see how
that could possibly be
any of your business.

198
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,942
Yeah, you're right.

199
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,444
Forget I asked.

200
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,215
So what are you guys
doing out here?

201
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,250
- What are we doing out here?
- Uh...

202
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,853
We're, um,
what you call it?

203
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,489
- Astronomers.
- Astronomers, yeah.

204
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,292
Yeah, you know,
we're just out
stargazing.

205
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,428
You know, that's, uh,
that's what we do.

206
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,497
It's what we do.

207
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,500
Beautiful, huh?

208
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,478
George:
Okay, give it a shot.

209
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,919
Modern,
stupid damn cars.

210
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,527
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

211
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,197
Yeah, don't let her
fool you.

212
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,066
That's when they're
the most dangerous.

213
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,868
When they're sleeping.

214
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,504
Next thing you know,
they got their arms
around you...

215
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,239
- Mm-hmm.
- ...hold you.

216
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,211
- What, do you got
 a problem with intimacy?
- Nah, I love intimacy.

217
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,447
As long as it ends before
9:00 the next morning.

218
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,383
Hey, guys,
somebody's gonna
have to go for help.

219
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,886
And when I say somebody,
I mean you, Joey.

220
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,555
What? Why me?

221
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,192
- Seniority, kid.
- Look, you'll get to
 the highway eventually.

222
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,560
Gee, thanks, George.

223
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,595
Here, you take this.

224
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,464
St. Joseph.

225
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,367
Patron saint of husbands.

226
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,004
You don't have
to believe in it.
Just wear it.

227
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,639
All right.
All right.

228
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,441
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

229
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,252
Ahem. What is it?

230
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,620
Astronomers, huh?

231
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,198
It's a kid.
Put 'em down.

232
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,673
What happened
to your car?

233
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,308
Battery shorted.

234
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,009
Did you shoot it?

235
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,146
Yeah, yeah.
How far to the next
gas station?

236
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,480
What's wrong with
that car over there?

237
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,349
Radiator blew.

238
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,418
It's got a battery,
doesn't it?

239
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,491
Joey, go get that battery.

240
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,162
- Go ahead. Just do it.
- Right, right, yeah.
 Seniority, I got it.

241
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,207
All right.

242
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,142
Try it now.

243
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,145
Huh?

244
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,380
All right,
let's go, guys.

245
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,115
Let's go,
let's go.

246
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,428
- Huh?
- Whoo!

247
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,597
- Yeah.
- We did it.

248
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,667
- That's right.
- Hey, kid, here's a little
 something for your...

249
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,638
trouble.

250
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,941
What?

251
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,412
Come on.
Let's go.

252
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,617
Man on P.A.:
This is the final call
for all passengers

253
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,520
departing on
the westbound bus
to San Francisco

254
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,056
with connection to Los Angeles,
platform eleven.

255
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,226
Oh.

256
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,461
You have to
give me your address.
I'll send you a check.

257
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,264
- Forget about it.
- Merry Christmas, hon.

258
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,199
- Oh, no. I can't.
- For the baby.

259
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,038
You all have been
so kind to me.

260
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,773
I don't know
how to thank you.

261
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,374
How 'bout a hug?

262
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,020
Come on.

263
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,398
Can I tell you
a secret?

264
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,603
You're almost as cute
as you think you are.

265
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,573
Man on P.A.:
All passengers
holding tickets

266
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,644
for bus 23 bound for Iowa,
please board now,
platform five.

267
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:23,382
Bus 23 for Iowa,
please board now,
platform five.

268
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,422
- Sweet kid, huh?
- There's something about her.

269
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,324
Yeah, it's called
way too much attitude.

270
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,427
- That's not what I mean.
- I must have left my watch
 in the car.

271
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,730
- What time is it, huh?
- It's, uh...

272
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,399
- My wallet.
- No, no, no.

273
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,368
That little thief.
Come on!

274
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,373
Excuse me, excuse me.

275
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,475
Hey, Joey, go ahead.
I got the next one.

276
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,116
- Go ahead, Joey.
 I got the next one.
- I got this one.

277
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,119
Excuse me, officer.
Have you seen a pregnant lady?

278
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,489
- Sorry.
- I just lost my wife,
 you know?

279
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,358
- Joey: Ah!
- Vincent: She's gone!

280
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,327
- This is your fault.
- Why me?

281
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,633
Hello. Yeah, Murray.

282
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,435
How you doing? Yeah.

283
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,736
Nah, everything's fine.
Yeah.

284
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,212
- Hey, Murray.
- You guys take care of
 our little problem?

285
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,782
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah. Leo's sleeping
 with the scorpions.

286
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,817
That's good.

287
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,586
Then why's he in
a hospital room
lying in a coma?

288
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,888
That's impossible.

289
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,823
He was dead,
right?

290
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,892
What am I, a doctor?

291
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,694
He looked dead,
he felt dead.

292
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,165
Well, if he wakes up
and starts talking to the feds,
I am gonna be dead.

293
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,168
Wait, Murray.
Maybe he wakes up
and doesn't say anything.

294
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,404
Right.
Why would he?

295
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,873
He thinks I sent you guys
to kill him, for God's sakes.

296
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,543
If he comes to,
he's gonna sing
like Sinatra.

297
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,378
We'll cross
that bridge later.

298
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,580
Right now,
I need you to
bring me Marley.

299
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:06,218
And I need you
to find Stella for me.

300
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,556
- Stella?
- Stella. Stella Destaid.
 She's my girl.

301
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,225
Well, she was my girl
till that damn drummer
tricked her head all around

302
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,660
and talked her into
doing this.

303
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,929
I found a note
that she wrote
this morning.

304
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,497
She's got a disc with
all the financial stuff

305
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,365
I don't want the feds
to know about.

306
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,435
And she thinks
having it will keep me
from hurting her or Jake.

307
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,939
- The little drummer boy's
 name is Jake?
- Yes.

308
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,341
- Jacob Marley?
- Yes, why?

309
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,677
No reason.

310
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,646
Okay, I want
Marley's chestnuts

311
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,548
roasting on that open fire
by Christmas morning.

312
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,951
And I need you to bring
Stella back to me.

313
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,786
But she did this.
What if she doesn't want to?

314
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,654
- What do you mean?
- We'll take care of it.

315
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,890
- Shirley:
Murray. Murray, honey.
- Good.

316
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,626
Where are your manners?
We have guests.

317
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,928
You don't offer
refreshments?

318
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,663
Please, you know,
I baked these personally.

319
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,267
- Oh, thanks, Mrs. C.
- Call me Shirley, hon.

320
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,935
- All right.
- Thanks, Shirley, hon.

321
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,737
- Sprinkles are my favorite.
- Oh, very good.

322
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,938
- George?
- I'll pass.

323
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,973
- Do you have diabetes?
- No.

324
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,641
Eat the cookie.

325
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,646
All right, now,
everybody, sit.

326
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,249
Go on, sit.

327
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,618
Don't mind Murray.
He loves the holidays,
don't you, Murray?

328
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,486
- Yeah.
- Peace on Earth,
 goodwill to man.

329
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,922
Tom Jones,
two shows nightly.

330
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,425
Some dentist from Scottsdale's
counting cards on table one.

331
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,564
Diego, table one.

332
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,865
That's right.
You see him?

333
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,469
Okay, do not make me
do your job for you!

334
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,906
Oh, you see how
stressed out he gets?
At his age.

335
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,475
Now, look, boys,
I want you to make sure

336
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,545
that my Murray has
a very merry Christmas.

337
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,780
So you find
that drummer.

338
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,015
We will.

339
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,583
- All right, boys.
- See ya.

340
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:48,320
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

341
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,722
She finds out about Stella,
I'm gonna be mincemeat.

342
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,526
Vincent,
I'll tell ya,

343
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,762
I feel bad for you 'cause
I know you want to be home

344
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,630
with your family
'cause it's the holidays,

345
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,632
but you finish
this job right,

346
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,601
there's gonna be a nice bonus
in your Christmas stocking.

347
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,636
- Thanks, Murray.
- And if you screw it up,

348
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,405
I'm gonna send you back
to them in little teeny

349
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,740
tiny gift-wrapped boxes.

350
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,543
All right,
now when you find Stella,

351
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,912
be gentle because--

352
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,982
well, as you can see,
she's very, very beautiful.

353
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,585
Do not try to muscle her
'cause she don't like that.

354
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,219
You gotta be nice,
you gotta be sweet.

355
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,489
You gotta force her
to come back to me of
her own free will.

356
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,425
She is pregnant
with my child.

357
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,927
And you know I've always
wanted to have kids.

358
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,664
I mean, it's like
a Christmas miracle.

359
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,033
So get her back, guys.
Okay?

360
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,548
There's still time for me
to make it back home,

361
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,516
but we've got to work quick
and we've got to work smart.

362
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,719
All right,
so you got any ideas?

363
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,755
I got plenty of ideas.
My Delores, when she was
in her third trimester,

364
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,824
she couldn't stop
eating or spending.

365
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,994
- All right?
- Okay, so...

366
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,496
- What do you mean, so?
 Come on.
- Credit cards.

367
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,470
Vincent:
I can't believe
I didn't see it coming.

368
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,505
I told you that you can
never trust a woman.

369
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,973
Not even a pregnant one.

370
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,744
- Well, you know, it's--
- No, no, no.

371
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,780
I spoke to American Express.
Vincent was right.

372
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,616
She's been running up
our credit cards like she's
married to Donald Trump.

373
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,753
- What did I tell ya?
- Clothes, food, a rental car.

374
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,888
- Where'd she rent the car?
- Thrifty.

375
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,557
- From Flamingo?
- Yeah.

376
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,393
Gentlemen,
I've got this one.

377
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,961
Go get 'em, killer.

378
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,932
- What are you drinking?
- It's a rum and Coke.

379
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,902
- Isn't that Delores' drink?
- Yeah.

380
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,638
I miss her.
And the kids.

381
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,341
- Delores.
- Delores.

382
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,978
Oh, yeah.

383
00:21:56,581 --> 00:22:00,018
Woman:
So this tells you
all about the supplemental
liability insurance you got.

384
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,054
- Okay?
- Man:
Sounds good.

385
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,457
- Woman:
Have a good day.
- You, too.

386
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,727
- Hey.
- Reservation number?

387
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,430
What, I need a reservation
to talk to you?

388
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,566
- Name?
- My name's Joey.
 What's yours?

389
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,071
Nina.

390
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,806
That's a beautiful name.

391
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,642
So, Nina, um,

392
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,444
I was wondering
if you could help me.

393
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,878
I'm looking for someone.

394
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,047
What's her name?

395
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,783
You would remember her,
she goes out to here.

396
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,885
Yours?

397
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,921
No, no.
Definitely not.

398
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,956
I'm just helping out
a friend.

399
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,559
A good Samaritan, huh?

400
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,061
Well, it's Christmas.

401
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,830
We do what we can.

402
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,533
She was here
just a while ago.

403
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,005
Got the premium package,
maximum coverage,

404
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,941
one-way drop-off.

405
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,809
And where was
she headed again?

406
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,678
She didn't say.

407
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,814
But she did take a map
and asked for directions.

408
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,483
All right, where to?

409
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,152
- Pahrump.
- Pah-what?

410
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,655
Pahrump. West of here
on the way to Death Valley.

411
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,526
Okay.
Nina, you're a doll.

412
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,462
You know, we're offering
a holiday special this week.

413
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,198
Oh, yeah?
So what's the special?

414
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,936
- Me.
- You?

415
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,073
Well, I'll bet
you are special.

416
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,210
But I really gotta go.

417
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,880

431
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,985
We would've found you
if you'd taken off from Mars,

432
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,987
Stella.

433
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,193
So Murray sent you.

434
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,798
My name's not Stella.
It's Mary.

435
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,967
Yeah, whatever
you call yourself.
I want my watch back.

436
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,102
- Yeah, me, too. Come on.
- Where's the disc?

437
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,704
It's in my purse.

438
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,908
- There you go.
- Ah.

439
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,612
Listen to me,

440
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,782
I was desperate
and I had to get away.

441
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,584
Yeah, the tears
are a nice touch.

442
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,119
If you hadn't gotten
knocked up, you probably
would've been a star.

443
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,156
Everything I told you
is true.

444
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,626
Oh, yeah?
You mean like, uh,
Sweetwater, Iowa.

445
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,828
There is no Sweetwater,
sweetheart.

446
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,264
- George checked.
- Okay.

447
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,801
And the husband
in the army?

448
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,169
Okay.

449
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,172
But this is real.

450
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,774
This is the realest thing
that's ever happened to me.

451
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,811
And I'm going to do whatever
I can to protect this child.

452
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,680
What, by stealing
from Murray Crown?

453
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,283
Have you ever
been in love?

454
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,951
Yeah, sure, I have.

455
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,587
Fortunately, it's always
only been temporary.

456
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,323
- Then I feel sorry for you.
- Yeah.

457
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,026
- Bingo.
- This the only copy?

458
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,196
Yeah. It's a read-only.
Can't be copied.

459
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,833
Okay, well, you boys
got what you want.
Merry Christmas.

460
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,637
- I need my keys because
 I have to go.
- Not so fast.

461
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,640
A woman in your condition
shouldn't be driving around
the desert.

462
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,075
- Why don't you come with us?
- I really don't want to go
 with you.

463
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,844
Nothing's going to happen
to you or your kid.

464
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,379
- I'm not going back to Murray!
- Get in the car!

465
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,347
- We're not
 taking you to Murray.
- Get in the car!

466
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,116
At least not yet.

467
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,351
- First, you're going to
 take us to the daddy.
- Who?

468
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,921
Murray thinks
he's the father,

469
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,356
but it's the drummer's,
isn't it?

470
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,125
Look, you got
what you want.

471
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,127
You got me,
you got the disc,
you don't need Jake.

472
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,663
Well, we need Jake
because Murray wants Jake.

473
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,331
And what Murray wants,
Murray gets.

474
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,300
I won't do it.

475
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,168
And I know what
you're gonna do to him.

476
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,371
Look at it this way,
you don't have a choice.
Get in.

477
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,410
Let's go.
Get in the car.

478
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,645
How many times
do I gotta say that?

479
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,380
Get my purse.

480
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,783
Put your seat belt on
for the baby.

481
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,052
- Come on, Joey.

482
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,853
Murray will send somebody
to get the car.

483
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,371
So is it
a boy or a girl?

484
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,373
I don't know.

485
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,942
Well, what does
your doctor say?

486
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,410
Huh?

487
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,679
You do have a doctor?

488
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,381
What's it to you?

489
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,184
You're always going on
about your wife and kids.

490
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,420
If you're such a family man,
what are you doing
with these two?

491
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,258
I can tell that
you'd rather be
with your family.

492
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,395
Come on,
it's Christmas.

493
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,964
The carols,
the tree.

494
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,900
Oh, and the kids
running down the stairs

495
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,836
ready to open
their presents.

496
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,039
Boy, it's a shame
you're going to have
to miss all that.

497
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,078
- You know what
 I'm thinking?
- What, Vincent?

498
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,281
I'm thinking that if we can
find this boyfriend of yours
and get rid of him real quick,

499
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,384
I can still make it home
in time for Christmas.

500
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,489
Yeah, nice try,
sweetheart.

501
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,258
- Oh, okay. Here we go.
- It's the hormones talking.

502
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,027
There's nothing
you can do about it.

503
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,928
Whatever,
just somebody shut her up.

504
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,265
Or what?
You'll get rid of me, too?

505
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,100
Is he always like this?

506
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,970
Now that you mention it,
he's even worse at Christmas.

507
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,772
Yeah, why is that,
Georgie?

508
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,975
When you were a kid,
did you catch Mommy
kissing Santa Claus?

509
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,444
- I'm an orphan.
- No kidding, huh?

510
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,713
What happened
to your folks?

511
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:08,753
My mother and father
were murdered in their sleep
on Christmas Eve.

512
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,856
- Oh, my God.
- That really happened?

513
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,192
Your parents
really got popped
on Christmas Eve?

514
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,798
No.

515
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,500
That's not funny.
You're sick, man.

516
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,002
That's not funny.

517
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,806
Um, you have to stop.

518
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,274
- No.
- That's not funny.

519
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,875
- Mary:
No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

520
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,210
No, look,
I mean it.

521
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,879
I have to go.
You have to stop.

522
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,147
I'll go in the car.

523
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,283
My Delores
in her eighth month,

524
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,318
she was like
a leaky faucet.

525
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,053
George, I think
you better pull over.

526
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,932
Mary:
You gotta be kidding me.

527
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,467
You can get back
in the car.

528
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,107
We should keep
an eye on her.

529
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,277
Where's she gonna go?

530
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,279
Eh, you got a point.

531
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,793
Dear... God.

532
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,204
Okay. All right.

533
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,324
- All right?
- Yeah.

534
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,532
- Joey, I'm sorry--
- We're not stopping again.

535
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,234
- Use a cup.
- I'm hungry.

536
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,870
If I don't eat something,
I'm gonna pass out.

537
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,872
She's right.
My Delores in
her eighth month--

538
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,407
- Fine!
- I'm just saying.

539
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,909
Fine!

540
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,478
Can I take your order?

541
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,047
Okay, so I want two burritos.
One beef, one chicken.

542
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,149
I want a taco salad
and I want a side order
of beans and rice.

543
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,051
- Do you have ice cream?
-Mm-hmm.

544
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,086
Okay, good.
I want three scoops of vanilla.
I want some apple pie.

545
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,088
- Ooh, and I want a pickle.
 Do you have fries?
-
Yeah.

546
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,291
Okay, good.

547
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,859
What, you guys
aren't eating?

548
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,571
- Oh.
- What's the matter?

549
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:44,142
- Um, I don't feel so good.
- That's a surprise.

550
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,278
- She don't look
 too good, George.
- I think it's the baby.

551
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,480
- Vincent:
Huh?
-I think it's the baby.

552
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,983
- You sure?
 Is it cramps?
- Uh-huh.

553
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,018
- Like a fist that's
 opening and closing?
- Uh-huh.

554
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,587
- I think she's
 having contractions.
- Give me a break.

555
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,121
- It's a trick.
- Hey, how do you know?

556
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,957
She's pale and she's in pain.

557
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,358
And she needs
to see a doctor.

558
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,593
She'll see a doctor
when we get to Pahrump.

559
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,927
Hey, anything
happens to her,

560
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,395
Murray ain't
gonna be too happy.

561
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,398
Come on, honey.
You all right?

562
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,601
Murray did say
he didn't want anything
to happen to her.

563
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,970
Oh, we gotta hurry.

564
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,672
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

565
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,141
- Oh, please.
- Take it easy.

566
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,081
Excuse me, nurse.
We got a pregnant lady here.

567
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,484
Two big men
for one pretty lady?

568
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,286
- My baby.
- Don't worry, hon.

569
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,288
Babies are what we do best.

570
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,189
- Who's the daddy?
- He is.

571
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,492
Don't worry,
I haven't lost
a father yet.

572
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,633
Oh, why is he here?
I don't want him here.

573
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,536
Come on, Daddy,
take her hand.

574
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,204
Talk to her.

575
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,181
Did you pick the names?

576
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,317
- Names?
-Something Christmas-y

577
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,720
like Holly or Ivy
or Eve would be nice.

578
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,122
You know,
Holly's not that bad.

579
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,725
Yeah. And if it's a boy,
we could call him Rudolph.

580
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,164
- Or Jake.
- I'll get Dr. Ames.

581
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,239
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You're cutting off
my circulation.

582
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,244
Please don't go.

583
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,213
I'm not going anywhere.

584
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,485
Hey, you skipped out
on us once already.

585
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,454
I'm not going to be fooled
by your little charades again.

586
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,323
Do you really think
that I'm faking this?

587
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,626
Well, let's just say
I wouldn't put it past you.

588
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,164
Here, murder this one
for a while.

589
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,301
So let me ask you,

590
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,436
why'd you run out
on Murray?

591
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,672
Oh, my God.
Why do you care?

592
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,709
I don't. You know,
it's just he's rich.

593
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,845
I'm sure he could've
taken care of you
and the kid.

594
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,546
All you had to do
was say that it was his.

595
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,149
Look, he doesn't want me.

596
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,151
He doesn't want the baby.

597
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,687
It's his pride.

598
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,823
- That's what
 I took from him.
- Right, right.

599
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,627
And this drummer guy,
is he worth it?

600
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,096
Again, why do you care?

601
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,633
Hey, look, lady,
I don't care, okay?

602
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,169
It's just that
this Marley character

603
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,605
- doesn't sound
 like a very good bet.

604
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,441
How can you say that about
someone you don't even know?

605
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,344
First of all,
messing with
Murray Crown?

606
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,247
That alone ain't
the smartest of moves.

607
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,717
- Help.
- But what the hell?

608
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,252
He took his shot, right?

609
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,255
But then he went
and dragged you into it.

610
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,590
Put you
and your kid's necks
on the line.

611
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,427
And that is something
I never would've done.

612
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,429
Yeah, see,
if I was in love
with you,

613
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,165
I would never put you
in danger.

614
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,500
'Cause I wouldn't
want someone like me
coming after you.

615
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,640
You know,
I'm starting to get
the crazy idea

616
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,376
that you're not
such a creep.

617
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,749
Yeah.

618
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,618
Well, I would be
a bad bet, too.

619
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,156
You know,
you don't have to do this.

620
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,825
You could just let me go.

621
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,365
Oh, not again.

622
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,168
Oh, come on!

623
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,471
You know, you're
a pretty good actress.

624
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,372
But you can stop all this

625
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,242
'cause I have a job to do
and I'm gonna do it.

626
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,812
And all the tears in China
ain't gonna change that
one bit.

627
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,481
Are you kidding me?!

628
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,353
I'm Dr. Ames.
How we doing today?

629
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,188
Dad, will you
give us a minute?

630
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,723
Thanks.

631
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,436
What do you think
about Holly?

632
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,538
Who's Holly?

633
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,878
- False alarm.
- I told you it was all an act.

634
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,815
He's very anxious.
Eh, expectant uncle.

635
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,784
Contractions were real,
but she could still be
a week away.

636
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,621
- Braxton-Hicks syndrome.
- That's right.

637
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,623
- She can go now?
- I'd like to keep her

638
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,924
for another couple of hours
just in case.

639
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,561
- All right, thanks, Doc.
- All right.

640
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,332
I hate hospitals.

641
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,635
Nothing but sick people.

642
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,837
Vincent:
Hey, Mary's not sick,
she's just pregnant.

643
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,407
Yeah, she's a knocked-up,
second-rate showgirl--

644
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,909
Hey, watch your mouth.

645
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,577
Why should I?

646
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,412
I'm just saying.

647
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,514
What is it
with you two?

648
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,449
I can see
that she's pretty.

649
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,585
I understand she's in
a delicate condition,

650
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,253
but the fact is,
she ripped us off.

651
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,990
Not just Murray, us.

652
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,393
All she does is
bat her baby blues

653
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,794
and you guys are gonna be
washing diapers?

654
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,530
Hey, diapers
are disposable,
George.

655
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,632
If we don't find
the drummer,

656
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,001
we are disposable, too.

they're popping popcorn,
trimming the tree.

666
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:21,672

00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,675
George:
Being outrun
by a pregnant...

673
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,911
this is a disgrace.

674
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,549
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, come here!

675
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:52,930
Hey!

676
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,005
Hey!

677
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,910
Man:
Pastor, what are we gonna do
with your wife now?

678
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,845
How am I supposed to
direct this pageant

679
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,414
with my Virgin Mary
on crutches?

680
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,117
Ruth, of all the times
to break your ankle.

681
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,087
What am I gonna do now?
What am I gonna do?

682
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,789
I'm done.
I'm finished.
I'm kaput.

683
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,859
I'm up the river.
I'm up the...

684
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:25,596
Oh, my Lord.

685
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,964
Would you look at her?

686
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,066
Yes, you.
Come here.

687
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,035
Right down to the belly
and everything.

688
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,671
Look at this.

689
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,039
Oh, and it's real.

690
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,676
Oh, glory, hallelujah.
You're a miracle, girl.

691
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,478
You can act, can't you?
It doesn't matter.

692
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,713
Ruth, boys and girls,
ladies and gentlemen,

693
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,648
I give you
our new Virgin Mary.

694
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,752
You are gonna be great.

695
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,587
You're perfect.

696
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,657
Oh, oh, oh.
Hey, hey, where you going?

697
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,059
- We can't go in there.
- Why not?

698
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,827
It's a church, man.

699
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,729
- What, are you superstitious?
- Very.

700
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,970
The past five years
I've played Mary,

701
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,038
but as you can see...

702
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,709
I'm Pastor Roberts.
Can we help you?

703
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,677
We're looking for her.

704
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,212
I'm the father.

705
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,082
Oh...

706
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,151
oh, no, he is not.

707
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,052
It's the hormones talking.

708
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,159
Honey, I was wrong.

709
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,829
I should have never said
those things that I said.

710
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,632
I just-- I want you
to forgive me.

711
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,167
Darling, please.

712
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,969
You gotta understand,
I want you to come back.

713
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,871
I need you to come home.

714
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,573
Home?

715
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,844
Do you even know
what home is?

716
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,078
Or love?

717
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,080
Or commitment?

718
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,517
I had to get away
from him.

719
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,820
And there were no rooms
at the Desert Inn.

720
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,289
I need a place to stay
and I was wondering

721
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,758
if there was a shelter
at your church.

722
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,893
We can't have our Mary
staying in the shelter.

723
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,996
Well, it's better
than a stable.

724
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,098
You can stay
with Ruth and I.

725
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,267
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
- Mary, we insist.

726
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,671
Go on now.

727
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,173
You need to be
taken care of.

728
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,176
Homeless,
friendless,

729
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,046
yet in her womb
lies the hope of the world.

730
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,615
God, I love that.

731
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,183
Okay, folks, remember,
rehearsal's 9:00 tomorrow
morning, okay?

732
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,117
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

733
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,325
I mean, she can't
stay in there forever.

734
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,694
Can always just go in
and blast 'em.

735
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,063
Well, there's
the Christmas spirit.

736
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,768
You know,
I bet she makes
a very good Mary.

737
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,770
Yeah, she got
the virgin thing down.

738
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,573
Eh, cell phones.

739
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,176
Yeah, hi, hon.

740
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,044
I'm okay.

741
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,614
Yes, I'm taking my pills.

742
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,083
- My bowels are good.
- Ew!

743
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,018
No, I mean,
everything is normal.

744
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,289
Ain't love grand?

745
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,958
Hey, you ever wonder
what it's like?

746
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,195
Wife, kids,
a Christmas tree.

747
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,097
She ain't worth it.

748
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,899
Who?

749
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,602
You know who I mean.

750
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,805
Vincent: Yeah.
  I love you, too.

751
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,210
I hate this.

752
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,312
I really should be home
with the family

753
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,247
and not doing this...

754
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,949
this stuff, you know?

755
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,785
Hey, Vincent.
You ever think about
doing anything else?

756
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,223
Teach.

757
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,259
I'd be a teacher.
Elementary teacher.

758
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,662
What, little Johnny
doesn't bring in
his homework,

759
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,797
you cut his thumbs off?

760
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,967
- Hey, I think
 you'd make a good teacher.
- Yeah, thanks, Joey.

761
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,037
- Thanks.
- Just until someone
 makes him angry.

762
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,373
Do you want to do
the honors?

763
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,716
I don't think she loves him.

764
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,284
Who?

765
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,154
Mary. I don't think
she's in love with
the drummer.

766
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,223
Baby's father or not.
It's just a feeling I got.

767
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,859
- Getting your hopes up?
- That's not what I'm saying,
 George.

768
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:19,129
I'm saying
if she don't love him,
maybe she don't go to him.

769
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,865
- Which would mean...
- That we don't get to him
 in time.

770
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:25,135
But-- but if she
still had the disc,

771
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,072
maybe she'd do it just
for the dollar signs, right?

772
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,740
I mean,
that's what I would do.

773
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,309
- Yeah.
- It's worth a try, right?

774
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,411
Not bad.
Knock yourself out, kid.

775
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,386
Look at this guy.

776
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,357
Sit down.
Practice makes perfect.

777
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,426
Yeah.

778
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,095
Look at that.

779
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,330
All right.

780
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,769
Hey.
What do you think?

781
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,307
Oh, he likes it.

782
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,975
It's kind of hard
to make a mistake.

783
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,477
Oh, you haven't
met my parents.

784
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,946
Oh, don't be
so hard on yourself.

785
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,248
You're good people.
I can tell.

786
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,450
Have you ever been wrong?

787
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,987
Once, but I
married him anyway.

788
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,358
Do not let him in.

789
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:24,428
He's the father of your child,
isn't he?

790
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,363
For your baby's sake.

791
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,706
God bless you, ma'am.

792
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,944
Hello, Mary.

793
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,182
I hope it's not too late.

794
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,985
For us, I mean.

795
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,720
After all...

796
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,791
it's Christmas.

797
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,365
All right, pick yourself
an ornament there.

798
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,434
Oh, that's a nice one.

799
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,869
Good job.

800
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,905
Nick, grab one there.
Right on the table.

801
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,540
Thatagirl.
Up you go.

802
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,809
All right, hang that
on that tree there.

803
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,846
- Honey, uh...
- Excuse me.

804
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,115
Pastor Roberts:
Careful, Nick. Good job.

805
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,318
There you go.

806
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,387
Your husband has a way
with children.

807
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,222
Oh, he's a real charmer.

808
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,924
Like any snake.

809
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,226
Look, Pastor,
you've been very kind,

810
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,195
but we really
gotta get going.

811
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,097
Oh, Joey,
you gotta stay
for supper.

812
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,065
- We'd love to.
- We--

813
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,104
Whatever you say, dear.

814
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,874
Pastor Roberts:
Then it's settled.
Dinner it is.

815
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,143
Daddy,
we forgot the angel.

816
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,279
Oh, the angel, yeah.

817
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,781
Um, angel.

818
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,120
You ready?
Pick her up.

819
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,455
Thatagirl.

820
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,391
Good job.

821
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,294
All right,
for the best part now.
Are you guys ready?

822
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,463
Okay, all right.

823
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,868
Lights, camera,
Christmas.

824
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,176
Mrs. Roberts:
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

825
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,345
- I love you.
- 
I love you, too.

826
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:28,318
- What the hell
 is he doing in there?
- I don't know.

827
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,387
But they do
a very nice tree.

828
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,160
My oldest, Nick,
was pouring ketchup

829
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,628
all over the head
of the other two.

830
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,196
- No.
- I'm not kidding.

831
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,098
You've got to watch them
every second.

832
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,300
- Thank you.
- Hey, ladies.

833
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,435
- I'd like to help out.
- Be our guest.

834
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,605
- All right.
- I'll leave you two
 lovebirds to it.

835
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,075
- All right.
- Can you believe her?

836
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,179
Yeah, well,
what about the pastor
quizzing us on the reindeer?

837
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,081
Yeah, well, I can't believe
you didn't know who Vixen was.

838
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,185
- Vixen?
- Vixen.

839
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,921
Vixen, okay.
Yeah, well, that shows
how much you know.

840
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,889
Hmm.-

841
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:09,159
I say they are
way too nice.

842
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,229
Yeah, you know,
I spent most of my life

843
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,165
running away
from people like that.

844
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,668
Christmas, huh?

845
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,536
Thank God it only
comes once a year.

846
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,638
Yeah.

847
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,275
Well, once is
one time too many.

848
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,378
Even though my old man,

849
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,181
he loved Christmas.

850
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,151
He worked for the Anyeli
brothers in the North End.

851
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:38,055
On Christmas Eve,
he would stop off
at Mangione's,

852
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,490
pick up a platter
of shells and sauce,

853
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:44,294
some calamari,
a little scampi.

854
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,498
Nice case of wine.

855
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,201
God, we ate like kings.

856
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,572
Then my father,

857
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,674
he would sit down
at the piano.

858
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,511
We'd all sing Silent Night.

859
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,249
Where was your mother
through all this?

860
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,551
That's a good question.

861
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,522
She, uh, she took off
when I was five.

862
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,258
I never saw her again.

863
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,427
I'm really sorry.

864
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,729
Eh, what can you do?

865
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,965
But my father,
he was great.

866
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:25,135
He always made sure
we had all the presents
we ever wanted.

867
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:28,071
Yeah, it was the exact
opposite with us.

868
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,441
We never really had
a happy holiday.

869
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,678
We had more fighting
than fun.

870
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:38,315
But, you know,
I still always
loved Christmas.

871
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,118
I always thought next year
would get better, you know?

872
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,120
When you're a kid,
you still want to believe

873
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,223
in sugarplum fairies
and Santa Claus.

874
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,525
Then life kind of
gets in the way.

875
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,595
Yeah. Yeah, I know
what you mean.

876
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,965
Do you?

877
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,970
Ahem. Excuse me.

878
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,552
- Oh, uh, hey,
 I got you something.
- Yeah?

879
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,322
Yeah, you know,
for Christmas.

880
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,523
Hmm.
Is it ticking?

881
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,124
Come on, open it.

882
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,531
Oh.

883
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,333
Oh, it's adorable.

884
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,470
Oh, I don't know
what to say.

885
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:36,340
Eh, well,
don't say anything.

886
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,574
Here you go.

887
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,183
Let me show you your room.

888
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,019
Our room.

889
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,322
Come on, darling.

890
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,125
The bathroom is
the first door
on the right.

891
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,593
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

892
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,529
Wow.

893
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,765
Honey,
doesn't this remind you

894
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,368
of that cute little B and B
we stayed at up in Tahoe?

895
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,437
Well, if you
need extra blankets,
they're in the closet.

896
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,739
- Okay, thank you.
- Good night.

897
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,207
Good night.

898
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,647
So you wanna leave...

899
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,182
leave.

900
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,351
George and Vincent
are right outside.

901
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,453
I'm sure they'd be happy
to give you a ride.

902
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,188
I think I'll stay
right here.

903
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,656
Okay, fine.

904
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,395
So, uh,
what's your preference?

905
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,463
About?

906
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,565
Do you prefer the right side
or the left?

907
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,702
Very funny.
You're a funny guy.

908
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:42,773
Oh, what?
You think I'd try anything
with you like that?

909
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,509
I wouldn't put it past ya
as long as I had a pulse.

910
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,544
Yeah, well,
even if I did try anything,

911
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,346
it would only be
for your benefit.

912
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,647
Excuse me?

913
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,549
Yeah, yeah.

914
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,718
I've heard all about
you pregnant women

915
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,319
who are close
to giving birth.

916
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,622
You get all
kinds of crazy

917
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:02,192
and you like a man
to attend to your,
you know, needs.

918
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:08,765
If I was climbing the walls
insane with desire,

919
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,501
you'd be the last man
I'd even consider.

920
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,337
Okay, okay.

921
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,773
You made your point.

922
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,209
You know, sometimes
you're not a very nice person.

923
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,578
Wow. That hurt.

924
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,280
Coming from a hit man.

925
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,749
Okay, well,
I'm going to bed.

926
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,251
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not going to bed.

927
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,820
You are sleeping
on the floor.

928
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,556
- On the floor?
- On the floor.

929
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,591
Okay, look,

930
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,427
I would sleep
on the floor if that's
what you really want--

931
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,429
Believe me,
that is what
I really want.

932
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,698
I can't.
I can't sleep
on the floor.

933
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,667
Doctor's orders.

934
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,435
I got allergies.

935
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,638
Fine.

936
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,440
But you stay
way over there.

937
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,242
And none of these clothes
are coming off.

938
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,944
I swear to God,
if you try anything...

939
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,745
Yeah, well,
you got nothing
to worry about.

940
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,365
Can I get
a kiss good night?

941
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,805
I'd rather have
morning sickness.

942
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,373
Okay, why do you
gotta say that?

943
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,542
I mean, why do you got to
hurt my feelings like that?

944
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,878
- Do you even
 have feelings?
- Well, do you?

945
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,780
How do you think
I got into this situation
in the first place?

946
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,716
You know what?
Go to sleep.

947
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,652
I am warning you,
I bite.

948
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,787
- Really?
- Good night.

949
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,723
Shut the light off.

950
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,464
You moved.

951
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,966
I told you
not to move.

952
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,968
My arm fell asleep.

953
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,236
Cut it off.

954
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,029
Joey.

955
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,032
So I, uh,
I changed my mind.

956
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,302
You know,
if you wanna...

957
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,770
you know...

958
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,791
- Huh?
- Let's go.

959
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,765
George:
All righty.

960
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,800
- Joey:
Are we good?
- George:
Locked and loaded.

961
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,815
Need a lift?

962
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,053
- Hey, thanks for stopping.
- No problem.

963
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,042
Hey, Joey,
I owe you an apology.

964
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,911
For a minute back there,

965
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,379
I thought
you'd fallen for her.

966
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,676
- Happy holidays.
- Same to you.

967
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,761
- Hello?
- Yeah, hey, Murray.

968
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,697
Oh, hello, Mrs. C.

969
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,632
Murray's not here.

970
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,101
Can I help you, Joseph?

971
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,703
Uh, yeah, could you
give him a message?

972
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,172
Tell him we think we found
that Christmas gift
he was looking for.

973
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,975
A gift?
What's the gift?

974
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:22,011
Uh, I really
can't tell you.

975
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,713
It's supposed to be
a surprise.

976
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,082
Oh, well,
I love surprises.

977
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,118
Just tell me, is this
a Christmas gift for me?

978
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,955
Uh, look, I really
can't tell you, Mrs. C.

979
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,757
Oh, come on.
It's Shirley.

980
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,458
Just give me a hint.

981
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,527
Where you picking
this gift up?

982
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,796
Neiman's? Cartier?

983
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,466
It's a little place
called the Aztec in Pahrump.

984
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,168
What?

985
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:48,972
Mrs. C, yeah,
just give him the message,
would ya, sweetheart?

986
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,640
Yeah, I'll tell him, honey.

987
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,509
All right,
thanks, hon.

988
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,544
- I didn't--
- What's the matter with you?

989
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,679
Hey, you don't need to raise
your hand to me, all right?

990
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,214
It's-- ow, ow!

991
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,932
- Hello?
- Mary:
About time.

992
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,535
- Hey, Stella.
- Hello, Jake.

993
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,872
Baby, I'm so glad
to see you.

994
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,707
Hey, sweetheart.

995
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,242
Come on.

996
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,012
There, baby.

997
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,015
What?

998
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,850
What?
What's the matter?

999
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,519
If you knew what
I have been through...

1000
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,154
Oh, sweetheart,
I know.

1001
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,056
I know and I want to hear
all about it.

1002
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,658
Okay?

1003
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,193
I do.

1004
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,862
But first things first,
hon.

1005
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:46,963
Did you bring it?

1006
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,934
The disc.

1007
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,536
That's what
you ask me first?

1008
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,306
Not how am I
or how's the baby?

1009
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,808
Look, babe,
you know all that stuff
goes without saying.

1010
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,109
You know I love you.

1011
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,245
You know I love kids,
all right?

1012
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,581
We just need this
insurance policy,
all right?

1013
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,317
- Just in case Murray
 comes after us.
- Oh, he tried.

1014
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,052
What?

1015
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,120
Yeah.
He sent three wise guys.

1016
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,257
So where are they?

1017
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,328
What, you got away
from them, hmm?

1018
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,131
Couldn't have been
the wisest of wise guys.

1019
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,734
Or maybe I'm smarter
than you think.

1020
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,136
Hey, ahem,
excuse me.

1021
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,939
Did I ever say
you were dumb, ever, huh?

1022
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,808
Why would you
even say that?

1023
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,977
Why would you even say that,
baby? Come here.

1024
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,745
Hmm?

1025
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,347
You know
I don't think that.

1026
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,315
Angel.

1027
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,285
So where is it, huh?

1028
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,928
This really is
all you care about,
isn't it?

1029
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,296
What are you
talking about?

1030
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,164
If you gave
a damn about me,

1031
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,933
you wouldn't have
gotten me involved.

1032
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,768
You would have kept
me and the baby
out of it, Jake.

1033
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,870
And I would have
if there would have been
any other way, Stella.

1034
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,172
- All right?
- It's Mary.

1035
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,609
You gotta believe me on this,
but what is that?

1036
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,111
- This?
- Yeah, this.

1037
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,913
This is a present.

1038
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,815
- A present?
 A present from who?
- No one.

1039
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,651
It's one of the wise guys.

1040
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,185
Wise guys?

1041
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,188
Excuse me.

1042
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,259
- Murray Crown says hello.
- Hey, fellas.

1043
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,895
I should have known.
Even your presents are poison.

1044
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,864
Yeah, yeah.
Where's the disc?

1045
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,802
Look, fellas,
I don't know how much
Murray's paying you, but--

1046
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,371
Hey, hey! Wait a minute!
Back pocket, back pocket,
back pocket!

1047
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,206
- Give it to him.
- Hey, I got it.

1048
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,975
- All right?
- All right, shut up now.

1049
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,419
You didn't think
we'd give you back
the real disc, did you?

1050
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:52,155
Okay, what now?

1051
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,991
- Now we take you to Murray.
- Why bother?

1052
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,660
Why don't you go ahead
and kill us both right now
and get it over with?

1053
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:00,129
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Hey.

1054
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,131
You aren't the father
of the child.

1055
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,833
- All right,
 all right, let's go.

1056
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,301
Let's go.
Get up.

1057
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,837
- Let 'em go.
- What?

1058
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:11,441
I just schlepped
all the way from Vegas,
don't make me ask twice.

1059
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:15,011
So, uh, what brings you
to Pahrump, Mrs. C?

1060
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,980
It is Shirley, remember?

1061
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,982
What do you want?

1062
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:22,452
For now,
I would like everybody
to just sit down.

1063
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,287
- George: Sit down.
- Vincent: Yeah.

1064
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,221
- You just told me to stand.
- You heard her.

1065
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,257
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
 Thank you.

1066
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:32,195
Now, I brought cookies.

1067
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,130
Here, honey,
have a cookie.

1068
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,132
I haven't put
any arsenic in these...

1069
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:37,266
yet.

1070
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,271
Jake, I'm sure
you need a cookie.

1071
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,841
Sure.
Does Murray know
we're here?

1072
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,243
If he did,
your heart would be
in your throat, literally.

1073
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:52,415
All right.

1074
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,150
You asked me what I want,

1075
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,185
I want Murray.

1076
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,888
He may be a fool,
but he is my fool.

1077
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,456
And I have to keep him safe

1078
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,059
from the feds and from you.

1079
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:06,129
Especially from you.

1080
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:09,298
Mrs. Crown,
I swear, he's all yours.
You can have him.

1081
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,435
I don't love Murray.
Murray doesn't love me.

1082
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,270
Save the saccharine, doll.

1083
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,839
As long as he thinks that
that baby is his,

1084
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,408
he will never let go.

1085
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:22,512
That is why I cannot let them
bring you back to Vegas.

1086
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:23,946
So what are you saying,
Mrs. C?

1087
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,348
Do you want us to...

1088
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,050
No.

1089
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,453
As much as I'd like to,
Murray would never forgive me.

1090
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:33,089
So here's what
we're gonna do.

1091
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,992
You are gonna write Murray
another letter.

1092
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,428
And you are gonna tell him
that that baby is not his

1093
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:41,464
and that you will take
a paternity test to prove it.

1094
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:45,968
Do this, not only
will you and Jake
and the baby

1095
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,904
live to see
another Christmas,

1096
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,807
but I am gonna
throw in

1097
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,776
a very nice
going-away present.

1098
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,512
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1099
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,215
Now, that is enough for you
to make a fresh start

1100
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,952
far away from Murray.

1101
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,089
Start writing,
sweetheart.

1102
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,327
Hey.

1103
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,995
Let's go.
What are you waiting on?

1104
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,999
Mary, Mary,
don't do this.

1105
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,068
Joey,
let go of my arm.

1106
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,476
Listen, Mrs. C,

1107
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,377
Shirley.

1108
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,381
Could I get a minute
with her?

1109
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,018
Joey.

1110
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:37,553
Please.

1111
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,125
All right.
Make it quick.

1112
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,393
All right.

1113
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:48,898
- What-- what are you doing?
- All: Shut your mouth.

1114
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,841
So you leave with this guy
and then what?

1115
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,310
Well, then Jake and I
get the money

1116
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,080
and this baby
will have a future.

1117
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,048
Ah, come on.

1118
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,384
You really think
this schmuck's gonna
stick around?

1119
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,155
What's my alternative?

1120
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,556
I go back to Murray?

1121
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,992
No, no, it doesn't
have to be either-or.

1122
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,994
Okay.

1123
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,329
Well,
what's my third choice?

1124
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,965
Who's gonna help me
raise this baby?

1125
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,106
- Mary, I--
- You what?

1126
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:33,476
- Joey, what?
- I can help you.

1127
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,478
I got money.

1128
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,013
Yeah?

1129
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:42,585
Well, unless you have
something else to offer...

1130
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:44,987
- Mary...
- No.

1131
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,056
No, no, no.

1132
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,126
It's Stella.

1133
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,829
All right,
you boys got the disc?

1134
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,566
You better get back to Vegas.
Murray's waiting for it.

1135
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:59,602
Yes, but Murray wanted us
to bring the two of them back.

1136
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,505
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll take care of Murray.
You guys just get going.

1137
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,507
- Come on. Come on.
- You sure?

1138
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,276
Yeah, I'm just gonna
stay here and make sure
she does her scribbling.

1139
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,111
Vincent:
You want the cookies, Mrs. C?

1140
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,213
Shirley:
No, you keep 'em.

1141
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,953
Hey, uh...

1142
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,123
I hope the three of you
will be very happy.

1143
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,558
Merry Christmas.

1144
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,069
You keep writing.

1145
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,403
I'm gonna be right back.

1146
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,276
Hey, guys.

1147
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,345
Guys, come here.

1148
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,280
You know,
I really want you to know

1149
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,415
how much I appreciate
all your help.

1150
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,051
And to show you how much
I appreciate it,

1151
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,654
there will be a nice
Christmas bonus in all
of your bank accounts.

1152
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,656
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks, Mrs. C.

1153
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,359
- It's Shirley, doll.
- Yeah, Shirley, doll.

1154
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,629
- Yeah, thanks a lot
 for the cookies.
- Yeah, okay.

1155
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,330
Hey, Joey,
come here.

1156
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:05,735
So why didn't
you tell her?

1157
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,070
Tell her what?

1158
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,476
And you call yourself
a wise guy.

1159
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:14,543
Joey.

1160
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,154
Murray's wise guys
go bye-bye?

1161
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,591
- Yeah.
- Good.

1162
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,126
Change of plans, Mrs. C.

1163
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,128
Oh, crap.

1164
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,596
Or is it Shirley?

1165
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,032
It's Mrs. Crown.

1166
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,139
Jake.

1167
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,514
What time's that flight leave?
Excellent.

1168
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,549
Thank you.

1169
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:56,786
They got me on the red-eye.
All right.

1170
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,388
Get to spend Christmas,
after all, with the family.

1171
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,290
How wonderful for you.

1172
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:04,293
What's the matter, Georgie?
Got the holiday blues?

1173
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:05,661
Need a hug, pal?

1174
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,465
- Huh?
- I don't think so.

1175
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,767
You know what you should do?
You should come home with me
for Christmas.

1176
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,037
You, too, Joey.
We got lots of room.

1177
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,406
Thanks, Vincent,
but I got people
waiting for me.

1178
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,342
He's got people.

1179
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,011
What's her name?

1180
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,458
You sure you won't
change your mind?

1181
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,793
- Thanks anyway.
- All right, killer.

1182
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,429
- Have a merry.
- Say hi to Delores for me.

1183
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,465
I will.
She'll be disappointed.

1184
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,767
- Merry Christmas, Vincent.
- Thanks a lot, Joey.

1185
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,769
- Take care, kid.
- I'll see you soon.

1186
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,571
- Change your mind,
 let me know.
- All right.

1187
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,339
- We got plenty of room.
- Thank you.

1188
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,042
Time to see Murray.

1189
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,246
- Where should I drop you?
- Doesn't matter.

1190
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:00,082
- Any place
 with holiday spirits.
- Fair enough.

1191
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,130
It's from a friend.

1192
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:29,245
I, uh, could play
hard to get,

1193
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,514
but what the hell,
it's Christmas, right?

1194
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,115
'Tis the season.

1195
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:38,354
- You look like you could
 use some holiday cheer.
- Ah...

1196
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,291
So what do you say
we go back to my place?

1197
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:46,162
Maybe hang my stockings
by the chimney with care.

1198
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,131
- Then...
- Those are great stockings.

1199
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:52,501
And you're beautiful.

1200
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:57,840
And tonight...

1201
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,110
you know, I could
really use the company.

1202
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,881
So what do you say?

1203
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,251
I'd say I'm probably going to
hate myself in the morning.

1204
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,221
I hope so.

1205
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,897
Merry Christmas.

1206
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,376
- Yeah, George.
-Leo's talking.

1207
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,245
When did he wake up?

1208
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,180
- You get Vincent.
- No, no, no.

1209
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,349
Tell Murray I'm on it.

1210
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,650
Holy Christmas.

1211
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,534
- Raul.
- Woman:
Sheriff, join us.

1212
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,504
- Have a little champagne.
- Here.

1213
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:04,840
- Cheers.
- I don't know
  about champagne.

1214
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,443
- Woman:
How about a cookie?
- A cookie will be just fine.

1215
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:19,889
Boo.

1216
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,862
Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo.

1217
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,732
Are you gonna be
a good boy?

1218
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:33,269
Look, I screwed up.
I know I screwed up,

1219
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,771
but Murray's got nothing
to worry about, I swear.

1220
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,673
I wouldn't rat him out.

1221
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,975
What were you thinking, huh?
Giving her that disc?

1222
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,545
I was worried about her.

1223
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,247
When she took up with
that Marley joker,

1224
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,483
I thought Murray
was gonna go nuts.

1225
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,318
I thought he was
gonna hurt her.

1226
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,453
I couldn't
let that happen.

1227
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,955
I didn't want nothing bad
to happen to her.

1228
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,926
Yeah, I know the feeling.

1229
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,761
So she got to you, too, huh?

1230
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,996
What are you talking about?

1231
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,999
I'm talking she's a good kid.
A sweet kid.

1232
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,834
Eh, she's nothing
but trouble.

1233
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,804
No, she's in trouble.

1234
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,706
Well, not anymore.

1235
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,841
Shirley fixed that.

1236
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,811
She gave Mary and Marley
enough money to live
happily ever after.

1237
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,547
Happily ever after?

1238
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:21,350
You think Marley loves her?

1239
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,018
No.

1240
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,820
He's only using her.

1241
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,356
I tried to tell her that
from the very beginning.

1242
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:30,960
Now that Marley's got his money,
he'll probably dump her
in the desert.

1243
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,394
Leave her high and dry.

1244
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,663
Why should I care
what happens to her?

1245
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,599
'Cause you already do.

1246
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,067
I'm not in love with her.

1247
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,836
- Who says you were?
- I'm not.

1248
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,341
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Leo, Leo, Leo.

1249
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:46,675
What the hell are you doing?

1250
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,410
Are you dying?

1251
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,046
Leo, you can't die.
I was supposed to kill you.

1252
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,049
Woman:
Crash cart to 15 north,
 code blue.

1253
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,753
Crash cart to 15 north,
code blue.

1254
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,055
Got it.

1255
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,423
Right here.

1256
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,026
- All right, surging.
- Paddles.

1257
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,928
- Clear.
- All right.

1258
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:06,996
Man:
One, two, three.

1259
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:13,068
Man:
These are happy times.

1260
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,404
Woman:
Merry Christmas.

1261
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,410
- Yeah, George.
-
Shirley's missing.

1262
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,045
- What?
-
Get downstairs.

1263
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,551
Vincent:
What a Christmas.
I was almost on the plane.

1264
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,490
- So how's my friend Leo?
- Leo's not a problem anymore.

1265
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,393
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1266
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,094
Ye of little faith.

1267
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,097
Pahrump.
I hate drummers.

1268
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,066
Yeah,
you and me both.

1269
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,535
I really shouldn't be here.
I should be home
with the family.

1270
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,089
Man:
Hello?

1271
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,591
- Okay, I got the money.
- The whole 250K?

1272
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,860
Yes. Of course.

1273
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,663
Uh, excuse me?

1274
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,465
That's it?

1275
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,968
Hell, I was willing to go 250
just to get rid of the skirt.

1276
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,105
That's all that cheap bastard
is gonna cough up for
the both of us?

1277
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,607
Hey, what the hell's
she doing? Tell her
to shut the hell up.

1278
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,142
You give me that.

1279
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,511
Just tell him from me--

1280
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,780
- forget it.
- Forget what?

1281
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,782
This whole fiasco.

1282
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,784
I would rather die

1283
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,754
than go on living
and believing that
my Murray

1284
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,957
would only come up with
a buck and a quarter for me.

1285
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:45,494
- He's paying 250.
- There's two of us, you yutz.

1286
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,096
- Murray:
Shirley,
 you're killing me!
- You got a point.

1287
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,897
- Oh.
- Hey, Murray.

1288
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,433
Yeah, forgot about the ante,
buddy.

1289
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,635
I'm gonna need another
buck 25.

1290
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:54,703
Murray:
No, no, no.
You can't do that.

1291
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,039
We had a deal
and it's Christmas Eve.

1292
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,208
Hey, it's not me, Murray.
It's your blushing bride here.

1293
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,477
It's the principle
of the thing.

1294
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,747
Can you hear me, Murray?

1295
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,750
They can hear you
in Reno, Shirley!

1296
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,454
Okay, 375.

1297
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,156
Where do I take it?

1298
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:17,960
Okay, uh, you know
the old horse track
just north of town?

1299
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,529
- Yes.
- Okay, well,
 I want you to go there.

1300
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,498
Yeah.
And you better go alone,

1301
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,967
Murray,
'cause I'm nervous.

1302
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,003
- Yeah, and nervous is
 when people get hurt.
- Oh, please.

1303
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,038
So go alone,
Murray.

1304
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,141
I'd hate to have
to leave these two
under the Christmas tree.

1305
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:35,711
- Ha!
- Oh, say hello to Murray.

1306
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,847
- Hello, Murray.
- Stella, baby.

1307
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,682
Murray!

1308
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,453
- All right, all right.
- Jake: Let's go.

1309
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,923
Stay.

1310
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,892
You know what,
you little pisher?

1311
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,994
You've been banging
those bongos too long.

1312
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,695
I think it shook
something loose
in your brain.

1313
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,531
Yeah, manna from heaven.

1314
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,833
You actually think that
you are gonna pull this off?

1315
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,735
You know what?
I wish there was
a bookie around here.

1316
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:02,771
I would lay
1,000 to 1 against you.

1317
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,573
Well, you know what?
You're forgetting something.

1318
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,141
I'm already holding Murray's
pair of queens.

1319
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,643
Open the door.

1320
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,145
- Get in.
- Oh, you're a genius.

1321
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:13,148
- Get in.
- Make the pregnant lady scoot.

1322
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,685
- Scoot over.
- Couldn't you get a sedan?

1323
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,487
- Shut up and get in.
- Oh, God.

1324
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,693
Gee, honey,
you really know
how to pick 'em.

1325
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,095
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Crown.
- Yeah, you should be.

1326
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,698
I am.
I made a mistake.

1327
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:31,500
Story of my life.

1328
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,104
Think I'm without sin?

1329
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,981
George:
They're heading east.

1330
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,916
Just keep going straight.

1331
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,746
Out.

1332
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,982
Come on.

1333
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,750
Stay.

1334
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,988
- Out.
- No.

1335
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:29,224
- No?
- I am not hopping
 another step.

1336
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,059
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1337
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,262
Okay. Okay.

1338
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,134
- There. Happy?
- Now go get her.

1339
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,939
You think this is funny,
 don't you?

1340
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,777
- You have got to
 be kidding me.
- What?!

1341
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,746
If you think
I'm walking in the dirt

1342
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:54,082
in my brand-new Manolos,
you are dumber than I thought.

1343
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,218
- So take 'em off.
- Yeah, I'd like to cram them--

1344
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,620
You know what, Mrs. C?
You're really starting
to worry me.

1345
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,188
Oh, well, then you're not
as dumb as I thought

1346
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,790
because you
should be worried.

1347
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,058
You should be
passing pickles.

1348
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,693
I'm worried that you're such
a pain in the butt

1349
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,929
that Murray may decide
he doesn't want you back.

1350
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:09,298
- He'd rather keep the money.
- Yeah, well, don't bet on it,
 Einstein.

1351
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:12,034
- My Murray loves me.
- God help him.

1352
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,937
So are you sure about that?

1353
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,406
- About what?
- About Murray loving you.

1354
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,007
- Excuse me?
- It's just that he sent me

1355
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,243
the most beautiful
diamond bracelet
last week.

1356
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:24,313
Now, look,
Murray sends diamonds
when he's feeling guilty.

1357
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,848
Now, if he loves you,
he's gonna send you flowers.

1358
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,785
- Has he sent you flowers yet?
- Oh, he's sent me flowers.

1359
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:31,920
He sent me flowers
and he sent me pearls.

1360
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,056
He sends pearls when
he's forgotten to call.

1361
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,824
He doesn't forget
to call me.

1362
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,225
He will.

1363
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,760
Oh, you know what?

1364
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,796
If I didn't have
these cuffs on...

1365
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,798
Oh, really?
Well, if I didn't
have my cuffs on...

1366
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:43,999
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah!

1367
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:52,941
Son of a...

1368
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,980
Ladies.

1369
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,849
Joey:
Hey, what just happened?

1370
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,684
I don't know.
It just went dead.

1371
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,453
- Come on, George,
 let's fix it.
- I can't.

1372
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:07,856
What do I look like,
a computer repair man?

1373
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,692
Oh,
marrón.
Do you see what
I'm seeing?

1374
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,027
Hmm?

1375
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,265
Follow that star.

1376
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,433
What'd you say?

1377
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,102
Just do it.

1378
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,396
Okay, I'm here.

1379
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,931
Oh, my goodness.

1380
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,867
Oh!

1381
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,969
Hold on, Murray.

1382
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:57,139
What the hell was that?!

1383
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,808
- Next time, I aim, ladies.
- Huh?

1384
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,410
Now move inside.

1385
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,945
Let's go!

1386
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:07,783
Listen, Marley, you hurt
one hair on their heads,
I'm gonna break your--

1387
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:10,118
Relax, Murray,
no one's been hurt.
Now where are you?

1388
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,454
I'm right next to
your piece-of-crap car.

1389
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:14,756
Good boy, Murray.

1390
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,858
Now come on inside.

1391
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:19,094
Take a left,
your first right,
we're in the middle stalls.

1392
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,365
We tried, Mrs. C.

1393
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,333
You did great, honey.

1394
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,070
Please, call me Shirley.

1395
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,905
That's far enough.

1396
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,378
Now what, genius?

1397
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,813
Now we wait.

1398
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,862
Season's greetings.

1399
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,964
'Kay, uh,
put the briefcase down.

1400
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,500
Put it down!

1401
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,406
Now move away from it.

1402
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,441
Come on.

1403
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,443
All right, all right.

1404
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,412
All right,
I want you to take
the handcuffs off.

1405
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:13,548
All right.

1406
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:17,219
Okay, Stella,
I want you to go over to it,
I want you to look inside.

1407
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,287
- Come on.
- All right.

1408
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,991
Give me the key.
Give me the key.

1409
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:24,993
Nice try.

1410
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:30,966
Jake:
Is there money in there?

1411
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,267
It look like a lot of money?

1412
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,872
I love Christmas.

1413
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:42,410
Well done.

1414
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,914
This money-- this money
just bought you Stella.

1415
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,549
Take a hike.

1416
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,153
And you're gonna buy me
a little time.

1417
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:52,921
- Come on,
 you're coming with me.
- Like hell I am.

1418
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,990
- You're coming
 with me or else--
- Or else what?

1419
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,425
Oh. Oh, no.

1420
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,529
No, no. You shoot me,
she doesn't live to see
New Year's, Murray.

1421
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,864
Oh, my God.

1422
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,233
- Oh, my God!
- What, what? What is it?

1423
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,102
She's going into labor.
Murray, help me.

1424
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:08,036
- Don't shoot her.
-
Come here, help her.

1425
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,305
Come on.
Murray, put it down.

1426
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,307
- Mary: Oh, no!
- Ah, the hell with it.

1427
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,409
- Murray, pick her up.
 Come on.
- Okay.

1428
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,411
Pick her up.
Follow me.

1429
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,313
In here. Here we go.

1430
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,182
- It's okay.
- Here we go.
 It'll be okay.

1431
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,217
- She's gonna be all right.
- What do I do?

1432
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,990
Yeah, I hope that hurt.-

1433
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,896
- Shirley: Breathe, breathe.
- Is she all right?

1434
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,665
Yeah, she's having the baby.

1435
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:39,100
- We better get
 her to a hospital.
- No, there's no time.

1436
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,502
Here,
get these off of me.

1437
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,038
George, come here.
Get me out of these things.

1438
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,047
- Hey, Vince,
 what do we do?
- I don't know.

1439
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,349
What do you mean
you don't know?!
You got like 17 kids!

1440
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,218
Hey, Delores had the kids.
I just handed out the cigars.

1441
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,922
- We better call an ambulance!
- It's too late! It's...

1442
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,924
That baby's on its way.

1443
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,694
All right.
Okay, uh...

1444
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,630
Joey, just lean down here
and hold on to her.

1445
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,665
- Come on.
- Go ahead, kid, go ahead.

1446
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,335
- All right.
- Have you ever done this
 before, Mrs. C?

1447
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,003
Are you kidding me?
She was a nurse when I met her.

1448
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,338
Remember, honey?
You had that really sexy--

1449
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,974
Murray, get your mind
out of your pants.

1450
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,644
- Go find a towel or something.
- Towel, towel, towel, towel!
 Towel, towel, towel.

1451
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,314
Okay, good. Good, good.

1452
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,516
Sweetheart,
you do realize...

1453
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,152
I know.
That kid ain't mine.
I know that, honey.

1454
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,154
Joey:
How you doing, Mary?

1455
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,965
Amateur.

1456
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,434
Now you're gonna push,
sweetheart. You ready?

1457
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:48,069
Keep breathing.
That's good.

1458
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,438
You're going to do one, two,
three, and then push, okay?

1459
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,107
- You're doing great.
- All right, now, honey,

1460
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,542
one, two, three,

1461
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,679
push!

1462
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,216
We got it!

1463
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,151
Oh, jeez!

1464
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,120
Bingo.

1465
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,157
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

1466
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,262
What are you doing?

1467
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,031
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1468
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,166
Oh, my God.

1469
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,539
It's a boy.

1470
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:28,410
- Joey, look at him.
- I am.

1471
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,349
Joey.

1472
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:37,619
Hey, Georgie,
you gotta admit,
it's a miracle, huh?

1473
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,797
- You know
 I love you, don't ya?
- Yeah, I know.

1474
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:52,634
I'm sorry.
I'm such a damn fool.

1475
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,503
Can you please forgive me?

1476
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,672
Yes.

1477
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,108
- But, you know,
 tonight is gonna cost you.
- Oh, I know.

1478
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:02,177
- No, I'm talking diamonds.
- Of course.

1479
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,778
- Ooh, maybe a cruise.
- A cruise would be nice.

1480
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,214
What are you doing?

1481
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,083
Giving the baby a gift.

1482
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,590
Hey, buddy.

1483
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:18,493
Don't worry,
it's real gold.

1484
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,400
Hey, um...

1485
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,471
this is so he'll always
have some spice in his life.

1486
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:44,652
You know what
you can give him?

1487
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,221
What's that?

1488
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:49,090
- You can give him his name.
- Jesus.

1489
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,427
- Will you look at that?
- Wow.

1490
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,195
It's snowing
in the desert.

1491
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,297
Look, honey.

1492
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:09,477
What time is it?

1493
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,481
It's midnight.

1494
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:16,684
Merry Christmas, baby.

1495
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,220
Merry Christmas, baby.
