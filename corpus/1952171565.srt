00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,574
Get out of the way!

4
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:03,318
Wow, that had to hurt.

5
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,757
Well, robbery wasn't a motive.

6
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:13,640
His eyes took the 
brunt of the punishment.

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,210
If he can't see, he can't fight back.

8
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,154
But he may have tried.

9
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,323
Tony Sciarra,

10

from Philladelphia.

11
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,203
So much for brotherly love.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS:  2004/04/01

26
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,828
Our victim Tony just  
checked into the hotel.

27
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:23,552
Hadn't even unpacked.

28
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:24,720
He made enemies fast.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,822
Yeah, the old man at the casino who  
he knocked down said the same thing.

30
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:29,548
He was howling ass

31
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:31,589
Why?

32
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,789
Blood drops are medium to large.

33
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:48,446
Low velocity of spatter, no castoff.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,942
May be he wasn't  
beaten with a weapon.

35
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,581
Hand to hand?

36
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,354
I know this guy is  
yoked, he's what?

37
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,735
6'2, 6'3?

38
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,121
Size doesn't matter  
when you're outnumbered.

39
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,559
Damn!

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,837
There's our vic, leaving the floor.

41
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:20,157
And the cameras, no eyes  
on the corridors or the rest rooms.

42
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:24,035
Yeah, well, we know where he went, 
just show us where he came from.

43
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,437
That's good. 
Start it from right there.

44
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,741
Did you see that?

45
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,507
Yeah, the little guy on  
the right just sneaked him.

46
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,376
You gotta be kiddin me,  
he just did it again.

47
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:56,107
Two for two.

48
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:59,789
That guy has got stones  
going after a mark as big as Tony.

49
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,551
He knows he has backup.

50
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,212
Is the third time a charm?

51
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:07,308
Yes, it is.

52
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,701
Busted.

53
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,281
Accusations from Tony.

54
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:13,845
He's gettin hot!

55
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:16,491
Some kind of denial  
from the little guy.

56
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,960
Tony got worked,  
he wanted his money back.

57
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,917
We're gonna need a still  
of the little guy's face if you could.

58
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,652
You got it.

59
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,445
Fractures to the zygomatic,  
ethmoid, and nasal bones.

60
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,003
Also, the mandible and the maxilla.

61
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,450
How many teeth did  
you find at the scene?

62
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,043
Two.

63
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,172
He's missing six.

64
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:45,279
I found one in the back of his mouth, 
probably swallowed the other three.

65
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,547
I'll check his stomach.

66
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,790
Blood evidence at the scene,

67
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,064
suggested his attackers  
did not use a weapon

68
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:56,047
Contusions are non-descript,  
no foreign tool marks,

69
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,009
Bare knuckles?

70
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,056
That's what I'm thinking.

71
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:06,171
Multiple blows to the head produced angular  
acceleration and deceleration to the brain.

72
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:12,159
Twisting to the brain 
causes the bridging veins to rip

73
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:17,617
from their the axons within the  
white matter of the brain begin to snap.

74
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,768
Officially COD is diffuse axonal injury,

75
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,548
unofficially,

76
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:26,967
so much brutal  
beating I've ever seen.

77
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:32,366
Neck bruises were  
made by a left hand?

78
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:36,267
What about these bruises?

79
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,118
There's no defensive wounds  
on the hands or forearm,

80
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:42,020
so I'm guessing  
he was restrained.

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,890
Bruises could be  
somebody's knees on his chest.

82
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,251
So a hand on his throat,  
knees on his chest,

83
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,882
his head was butted  
up against a wall,

84
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,766
and all the blows  
were directed at his face

85
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:56,046
Doesn't leave much room for  
any other attackers to get their legs in.

86
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,448
May be there were  
no other attackers.

87
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:05,144
One guy did all this?

88
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,718
So you're sure this  
was the man you saw?

89
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:15,090
Yes, I was in the bathroom.

90
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,072
I waited for him to leave,

91
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:28,372
- Then I called security. 
- Do you see this man now?

92
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,606
All you have to do is nod.

93
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,013
Thanks.

94
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:44,393
ID's off! We're looking 
for a blue shirt and jeans.

95
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:48,210
He could have ditched the 
clothes so let's be smart about this.

96
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,564
Las Vegas Police!

97
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,056
Put your hands behind 
your head and stand up.

98
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,962
Come on!

99
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,261
You're not much of 
a talker, are you Walter?

100
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:03,346
I tell ya,

101
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:07,599
you must be a pretty 
tough guy to take on Tony.

102
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,462
The guy's big as that, he's huge.

103
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,709
That's his name you know, 
Tony Sciarra from Philladelphia.

104
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,548
Did you know Tony?

105
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:24,347
How come you left his wallet, 
and $500 of chips in his pocket, huh?

106
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:30,260
Cuz, that makes me think 
this was about something else.

107
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,490
Did he wrong you in some way?

108
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,045
(Did) he hurt you?

109
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:45,909
May be it was just,

110
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,348
a lovers quarrel.

111
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,164
I'm not soft.

112
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:57,010
Yeah, it's ok. This is Vegas.

113
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,282
But that's not what 
we saw on the video.

114
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:03,648
You're at the Craps table,

115
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:05,308
you swiped his chips,

116
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:08,638
and then you whispered 
sweet nothings in his ear.

117
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,108
What did you say?

118
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:14,214
Give me a reason.

119
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:17,618
Tthat a confession? / No,

120
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:20,503
it's what I said.

121
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:23,162
That stare doesn't work on me.

122
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:27,041
Better save it, 'cause 
they're gonna love you in prison.

123
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,833
You can't fight.

124
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,921
Mr. Darian, may I see your fingers?

125
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,543
Why?

126
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,590
Well, because you may have 
evidence underneath the fingernails,

127
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,546
and I would like to collect it.

128
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,584
Mr. Darian, do you have a fever?

129
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,362
I'll kill you.

130
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,358
Get him down.
Get him down.

131
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:11,130
You might wanna 
double check that.

132
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:13,545
I did.

133
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,428
It's not as bad as it looks.

134
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:30,736
Never looks good when 
a suspect dies in custody.

135
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,753
What are you saying, Rory?

136
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:36,583
- You'd rather be one of us?
- No, that's not what I am saying.

137
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,469
If I was here I would have been 
in there with you, you know that.

138
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:43,920
It's just that we're gonna come 
out looking like the bad guy again.

139
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,040
You Okay?

140
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,109
I'm fine.

141
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:57,186
Nasty, kind of looks like a hickey.

142
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,954
You wanna tell me 
who got this party started?

143
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,423
I scraped his nails.

144
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,683
- That's it? 
- What was his liver temp?

145
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:10,196
- 101.5 
- He's been dead an hour.

146
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,464
That means that his 
body temperature was 103.

147
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:18,226
I felt his skin Catherine. 
It felt like it was on fire.

148
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:34,252
How did Walter Darian 
even drive this thing?

149
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,977
Where there's a will, there's a way.

150
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:39,619
PD found it in the Orpheus parking lot.

151
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:47,073
Blue shirt and jeans, right on top.

152
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:51,236
He didn't even try to hide them.

153
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:06,408
Positive for blood. 
I'll get it to Greg.

154
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:10,100
So this scumbag, Walter Darian,

155
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,621
he beats a guy to death, goes out 
to his car, changes his clothes.

156
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:17,025
goes back into the Casino, 
washes his hands, and just ..

157
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,867
gets something to eat?

158
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:21,748
Just another day.

159
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,150
Yahtzee.

160
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,244
Must be a few thousand 
dollars worth of chips here.

161
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:43,029
So, he drifts, but doesn't cash in?

162
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,523
May be it wasn't about the money.

163
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:52,046
I got gloves, a T-shirt and 
a jacket all with the tags still on'em.

164
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:55,469
May be he just likes to steal things.

165
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:07,691
Road side diner, Libby.

166
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,455
Sara.

167
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:21,301
What does that look like to you?

168
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:24,057
Burn holes.

169
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:28,665
The guy takes on 
five cops in their house.

170
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:32,179
Makes you wonder what he 
might have done to the waitress.

171
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:41,178
Didn't get enough of this guy 
in the interrogation room?

172
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:42,497
I have a question.

173
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,116
Yes?

174
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,797
- Cause of death?
- Well, it wasn't the nice stick action

175
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,505
Cardiac arrhythmia.

176
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:54,326
His heart rate increased 
til he went into Tachycardia.

177
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,265
Started throwing PVCs then V-fib.

178
00:14:57,265 --> 00:15:02,426
Prior conditions? / Nothing I could find
The guy had a big heart, 550 grams,

179
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:04,594
but otherwise healthy.

180
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,042
This guy was pumped 
up before the fight,

181
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,513
white knuckles veins popping.

182
00:15:09,513 --> 00:15:12,644
Well, he could've been 
on something. Tox is pending.

183
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:16,062
But there were no observable
effects of long term drug abuse.

184
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:19,629
No atrophies, 
cirrhosis, tissue necrosis.

185
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:22,399
I checked all the hot spots.

186
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:25,109
He had a temperature 
of 103 when he died.

187
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:27,610
Any pathology to explain that?

188
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,896
The organs showed 
no sign of infection or disease.

189
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,776
So there was nothing 
wrong with this guy.

190
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:37,076
Well, I'll send a tissue 
sample to histology but

191
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:41,469
98.6 is just an average
Some people run hot.

192
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:46,875
See, during questioning your 
brother became a little unruly, and

193
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:51,714
so for their own safety, the officers 
had no choice but to use force,

194
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:54,644
- at which point...
- No, I've heard enough.

195
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,217
Ms. Darian, it's very important 
that you understand the situation here.

196
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:01,152
I do.

197
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:03,975
Walter was killed in police custody.

198
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,812
Let me introduce 
Gil Grissom from the crime lab.

199
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:12,520
This is Beth Darian. / Hello.

200
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:16,792
I was in the room with your brother.

201
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,650
Is that how he touched you life?

202
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:25,327
The autopsy concluded 
that your brother's death,

203
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:28,637
was not the result of 
the officer's use of force.

204
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,961
I don't care how he died.

205
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,495
I'm just relieved that it's over.

206
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:41,079
Walter hurt a lot of people.

207
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:44,109
If you had something 
he wanted, he just took it,

208
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,618
and if you got in his way...

209
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,228
I always kept my distance.

210
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:55,813
Ms. Darian, your brother's 
body temperature was ...

211
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,275
Hot to the touch?

212
00:16:57,275 --> 00:17:00,025
He was always that 
way ever since we were kids.

213
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:04,200
I'll have somebody from the department 
contact you, all right, Ms. Darian?

214
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,057
I always knew that Walter 
would end up in Jail or dead.

215
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:12,706
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:32,551
Griss, what are 
we hoping to find here?

217
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:36,188
Walter Darian lived here.
He owned the place.

218
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,474
Greg ran the DNA, blood on 
Walter's clothes is a match to Tony.

219
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:44,088
The hair in Tony's hand is a match 
to Walter's, the case is closed, isn't it?

220
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,060
That case is closed.

221
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,380
You can't prosecute a dead man.

222
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:54,456
The evil man dew lives after them, 
but good is often turned with their bones.

223
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,686
Sheakespeare?

224
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,133
Julius Caesar.

225
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:15,079
This guy never 
threw anything away.

226
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,744
You think he had 
a major case of OCD?

227
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,252
Well,

228
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:24,957
if Walter viewed his 
world as a threatening place,

229
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:29,067
according to the shrinks, 
the hording of useless objects

230
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,870
may have made him
feel safe and secure.

231
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,698
Yeah, well, in the real 
world Walters is the threat.

232
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:41,874
Guess he didn't like what he saw.

233
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,804
Hey, Grissom,

234
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:22,037
this doesn't look like a Patio.

235
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,642
Libby, Libby.

236
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,342
Oh, yeah, dish girl.

237
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:38,359
- Did she have a last name?
- Sure she does, but I don't know it.

238
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,265
When was the last time 
you saw her? / 8 years ago.

239
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,321
The kid had no chops,

240
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,912
Burned herself real good.

241
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:49,155
That was her first and last day.

242
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,136
We need an ID. Is there any chance 
you still have a W2 lying around,

243
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,161
or a copy of a driver's license.

244
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,916
Girl wasn't here long enough to refill 
a coffee pot, let alone sign anything.

245
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,846
I don't know where she came from, 
don't know where she went.

246
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,796
What about this guy,

247
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:05,000
did you ever see him with Libby?

248
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:08,980
Uh, I'm gettin nothing. 
Sorry, orders up!

249
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:38,943
What thing makes this sound?

250
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:23,519
Well,

251
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:27,008
I guess there was 
no more room at the inn.

252
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,637
It's a wedding band.

253
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:57,263
You think this is the waitress 
Nick and Sara are looking for?

254
00:22:57,263 --> 00:23:00,190
Well, there's no clothing left, 
the wedding band can be either or,

255
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,774
There's nothing gender-specific yet.

256
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,906
Next to no tissue.

257
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,458
No hairs at all.

258
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:09,478
If you get the bones, 
what do you think, Grissom?

259
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:11,782
Been down here at least three years?

260
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,006
It's probably more that three years.

261
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,620
You're kidding me, right?

262
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,703
Well, the rule of thumb is if the skull 
smells bad it's usually under three years.

263
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,805
This one smells like dirt.

264
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:27,355
There's something 
under the pelvic bone.

265
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,142
Possible murder weapon.

266
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:39,684
Do you think we could 
still get any DNA off of it?

267
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:43,412
Any blood's been exposed to the elements
longer than the inside of these bones.

268
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:46,564
There's a little skin, clothing, 
and tissue to protect it, huh?

269
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:51,519
Doesn't fit. Walter was a fighter.
He used his fists not knives, you know.

270
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:54,465
Well, we haven't known him that long.

271
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,696
Forheads upright, smoothe,

272
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:02,509
mandible's small, 
lower face narrow.

273
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,747
- Female trace.
- Yeah, pelvis confirms it.

274
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,625
It's wide for the birth canal.

275
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,449
No, pits in the pubic bone. 
She never gave birth.

276
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,176
What about her race?

277
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:15,233
Zygomatic bones retreat, slant back,

278
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,508
nasal opening is long and narrow.

279
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:19,061
Caucasian.

280
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,772
Around 5'4.

281
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:24,607
I estimated her height 
from the length of the femur.

282
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:26,611
How old are we talking?

283
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:30,727
Well, third molars haven't erupted.

284
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:32,398
No wisdom teeth.

285
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,073
So that would put her
in her late teens, early twenties.

286
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:38,512
Yeah, it's a safe estimate.

287
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,079
Cause of death?

288
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,693
Strangulation. 
Fracture to the hyoid bone.

289
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,372
What about these right here?

290
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:53,167
Fractures to the zygomatic 
bone and maxilla, also to the left ulna,

291
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,849
but no tool marks 
on any of the bones.

292
00:24:57,423 --> 00:25:00,822
So may be, she was punched 
in the face and tried to shield herself?

293
00:25:00,822 --> 00:25:05,633
Yeah, Walter Darian strangled
a female caucasian 5 foot 4,

294
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:09,029
- around twenty years old.
- Yeah, but is it our missing waitress?

295
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:13,898
Well, I did dental charts, X-rays. 
David's off and running with them now.

296
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:17,086
I also excised a portion of the femur,

297
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:21,016
scraped a tissue sample from 
inside the pelvis and yanked a molar.

298
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:24,298
If there's any usable 
DNA left that's where it'll be.

299
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:32,500
How did you know there was 
another body at that motel?

300
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:34,468
I didn't.

301
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,697
Tox and histology results 
came back on Walter Darian,

302
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:43,760
negative across the board. 
No drugs, no diseases.

303
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,515
I don't get it.

304
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:49,294
The guys 38 years old, 
and this was his first arrest.

305
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,205
And you're wondering 
what he'd been doing all his life.

306
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,559
Willows.

307
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:05,257
Why don't you hold 
that thought until later?

308
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,287
Sorry.

309
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,255
A new friend.

310
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:13,241
Congratulations.

311
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,733
Got time for something a little weird?

312
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:21,348
I recovered DNA from 
your Jane Doe skeleton,

313
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,710
clean samples from 
the molar and femur.

314
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,189
But no hits in CODIS.

315
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:28,099
So Jane Doe was never 
reported missing. /Apparently not.

316
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:30,911
I also pulled DNA from the pelvic sample.

317
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:34,491
A mixture, foreign DNA from a male.

318
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:35,815
Walter Darian.

319
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:38,899
No, that's where it gets weird.

320
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,868
The foreign DNA was 
homozygous at all thirteen low signs.

321
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,685
One peak per marker.

322
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:49,643
Shared allels, so it was 
either a father or a son.

323
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:52,239
According to the autopsy
she never gave birth.

324
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,524
- So it was her father.
- Ok, so how did it get there?

325
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,594
The tissue was from inside the pelvis,

326
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,924
so even if Daddy's blood or
semen got on her clothes or skin,

327
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:03,531
it never would have survived
being in the ground all that time.

328
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:06,636
So there has to be 
additional biological source,

329
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:09,137
cuz there was no 
one else in that grave.

330
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,894
That's all I got.

331
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:15,687
No name, no tissue, no hair.

332
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,710
I like a challenge.

333
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,083
Pull the standard tissue thickness 
scale for female american. caucazoolids(?)

334
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,918
Use the normal figures.

335
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,476
Apply the mid line measurements.

336
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,113
Good, now the bilateral.

337
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:41,210
That's the blue print.

338
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:07,344
Ok, you can take this.

339
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:42,368
Long skull,

340
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:44,764
prominent nose and chin.

341
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:47,045
May be Nordic descent.

342
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:52,331
That means light complexion, hair,

343
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:55,446
and ...

344
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:58,537
blue green eyes.

345
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:43,410
Warrick.

346
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:50,226
These've gotta be maternity clothes.

347
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,572
And baby makes three.

348
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:08,207
Her name's not Libby.

349
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:12,472
Dental records confirmed 
our Jane Doe was Marissa Cleary.

350
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:16,052
Which leaves our missing 
waitress Libby still unaccounted for.

351
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:19,152
Foreign DNA in her 
pelvis wasn't from her father,

352
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,325
it was from her son.

353
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:25,310
There was no evidence 
of a fetus or a baby in that grave.

354
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,953
She never gave birth.

355
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,245
Not through her birth canal.

356
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,145
There's other ways to deliver a baby.

357
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:34,971
Oh, that might explain 
the hunting knife we found.

358
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:46,954
Umbilical cord contains fetal DNA.

359
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:54,132
Walter Darian never 
threw anything out.

360
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:57,653
So where did the baby go?

361
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,348
8 years. I never 
thought she was dead.

362
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:06,942
I've always wondered where she was, 
or what she was doing with her life,

363
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:10,644
or what my kid was like.

364
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:15,780
Mr. Cleary, we haven't found 
any evidence to suggest that your son...

365
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,698
Our son?

366
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:20,907
Well, Was it a boy?

367
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:23,993
Yes. / Well, can I see him?

368
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:29,111
Is he dead, too?

369
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,162
We don't know.

370
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:41,166
Marissa and I had only been 
seeing each other for a few monthes.

371
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,472
Everything was great.

372
00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:46,489
And then she got pregnant 
so we got married.

373
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,367
All of a sudden 
she hates me, I hate her.

374
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,603
All we did was fight.

375
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,598
She calls me one night at work.

376
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,004
You don't  want me in 
your life, fine, I'm gone.

377
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:02,199
Good, that's the best 
news I heard all year.

378
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:10,911
That was last time we spoke.

379
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:13,974
And you never reported her missing?

380
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:16,789
I didn't think she was.

381
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,484
She was 19, 
barely out of high school.

382
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:25,264
Last thing you needed was a family.

383
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,441
She was in her 9th month 
when she split.

384
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:33,313
I thought she'd cool off in a couple 
of days come back and we would ...

385
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,187
work things out.

386
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:37,839
But then I got this.

387
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:51,203
You're not who I thought you were.

388
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,510
You don't want me.

389
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,312
You don't want this baby.

390
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:58,145
We don't want you.

391
00:33:58,145 --> 00:33:59,927
Marissa.

392
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:51,098
Alright, you see the long 
legs she gives to her M?

393
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:53,566
And how it stands alone?

394
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:57,360
Alright, now check out
the Dear John letter.

395
00:34:57,926 --> 00:35:01,508
This is not Marissa's signature,
just a quick and dirty forgery.

396
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,583
My money's on Walter.

397
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,504
No, can't tell you anything 
without an exempler.

398
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:08,311
Yeah, well, Warrick's 
going through his stuff now.

399
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:10,455
From what I hear this 
is gonna take a while.

400
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:11,883
So what about this text?

401
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:14,139
Uh, not typed, printed.

402
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:20,520
Uh, off an ink jet, and so far all of Walter's 
acculmulated printers are dot matrix.

403
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,638
No match.

404
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:14,303
Warrick found a baseball cap in 
Walter's motel yielded a blond hair.

405
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:18,405
DNA was still good which means 
the hair is no more than a few years old.

406
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,484
It was Marissa's son's.

407
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:26,387
So he'd be 8 now 
assuming he is still alive.

408
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,587
Hey, guys. I've been working 
on that John Doe envelope,

409
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,352
the post mark was Henderson.

410
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:33,236
The Bates motel is in Sloan,

411
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:36,015
why would Walter go that 
far out of his way to mail a letter.

412
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:37,904
He wouldn't.

413
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:41,941
Well, I moved to Henderson 
to get away from Walter.

414
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:45,647
I stayed out of his life,
hoping he'd stay out of mine.

415
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:51,589
Didn't matter that I was his sister. 
He treated me like he did everybody else.

416
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,478
Do you recognize this woman?

417
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:00,525
No. Who's she?

418
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:02,667
Her name is Marissa Cleary.

419
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:07,766
We believe she was a guest 
in your brother's motel 8 years ago.

420
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:10,838
He killed her, didn't he?

421
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:12,350
We think so.

422
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,049
- I wonder what she did to set him off.
- I don't know.

423
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:18,249
Sure it wasn't much.

424
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,800
You don't want me,

425
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,073
fine, I'm gone. / Good.

426
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,633
It's the best news I've heard all year.

427
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:38,528
Shut up, shut up.

428
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,383
He could always find an 
excuse for anything that he did.

429
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:55,846
Are we keeping you 
from something? / No.

430
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:59,568
It makes me really 
uncomfortable talking about Walter.

431
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,697
Did Walter give you those burns?

432
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:13,844
No, that was ...

433
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:17,829
an accident on that job 
many, many years ago.

434
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,847
When you used 
to be a waitress, Libby?

435
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:24,773
Nobody's called me that in years.

436
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:29,599
How did you know? / We found your 
old waitress uniform in Walter's car.

437
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,256
I had the job for one day.

438
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:36,893
I was a lousy waitress,
why would he keep that?

439
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:02,486
Hi, mom. / Hey, baby.

440
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:08,212
Why don't you take your 
stuff, put it in your room.

441
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,950
I'll make you a snack.

442
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:26,350
- How old is that little guy?
- He's gonna be nine next month.

443
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:34,005
Open up.

444
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:50,569
You're not his mother.

445
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:53,003
I'm the only mother he's ever known.

446
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,963
I raised him, I had to.

447
00:40:12,104 --> 00:40:14,924
Middle of the night, your brother 
shows up and he hands you a baby,

448
00:40:14,924 --> 00:40:18,476
You don't ask any questions 
you don't report it.

449
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:22,291
Walter said that the 
mother was a runaway.

450
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,434
And that she didn't want the baby.

451
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:26,764
I took him in.

452
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:29,224
I love him.

453
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,744
How did Martin get the 
scar on his forehead?

454
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,984
I don't know.

455
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:37,801
Or you didn't want to know.

456
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:50,379
Marissa Cleary didn't sign that note.

457
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:55,229
And we don't think 
Walter wrote it, either.

458
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:58,670
I'm not like Walter.

459
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,034
When I opened the suitcase 
and I saw the photograph.

460
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:08,411
I didn't want the father to suffer.

461
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:17,051
The suit case was in Walter's closet.

462
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:19,340
I took it back.

463
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,716
I didn't want it around me.
I knew that he would never notice.

464
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,578
Giving me Martin ...

465
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:35,990
was the only good 
thing Walter ever did.

466
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,330
I don't know why he did it.

467
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,936
But it wasn't out of the 
goodness of his heart.
