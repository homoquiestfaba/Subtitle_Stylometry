181
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,609
You have to.

182
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,110
You can't not do it.

183
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,747
- Well, Mimi is my most
important ally in the world.

184
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,784
She is the number one
unconditional supporter of me.

185
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,820
- I hate the beard.

186
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,992
- d Mm-mm-mm d

187
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,161
We got two beautiful kids,
woodrow and Lulu,

188
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,496
and they're both artists too.

189
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,798
May God have mercy
on their souls.

190
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,400
They're very talented,
both of them.

191
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,168
They both got it going on.

192
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,074
- When you're an artist
in a house of artists,

193
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,142
it's hard to stand out.

194
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,445
- I try not to give advice.

195
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:13,152
But you know
what my only advice is?

196
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,287
- What?

197
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,688
- I would put in
the big areas first.

198
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,089
That's all.

199
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,794
I mean, it's interesting
to work from detail to large,

200
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,062
like you do,
I guess.

201
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,830
I'm not gonna say nothing.
- You already did.

202
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,399
- What about your composition,
though?

203
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,100
You make sure
you got enough room

204
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,101
for the green, right?

205
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,337
- Yeah.

206
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,174
Yeah,
I want to be like my dad.

207
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,208
[Laughs]

208
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:51,057
- Here's a drawing Woody did
when he was about two years old.

209
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,959
He started drawing
really early.

210
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,161
He just developed
really quick.

211
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,331
These are the ones I just drew
beside you as you were drawing.

212
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,234
I was getting this real burst
of energy

213
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,370
just working with him.

214
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,840
- Our family as a unit
has the identify of, like,

215
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,342
we're all in this together.

216
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,811
You know, we all know
what it feels like

217
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,147
being an artist
in this society.

218
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,650
- Yeah?

219
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,385
It's a good one.

220
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,354
These are
the thrift store paintings

221
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,090
the way they are
when I find them, of course.

222
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,061
And then I do my thing,

223
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,832
and they wind up like this.

224
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,468
This one says,
"eastern [Bleep] it."

225
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,571
- The very first time
I showed Wayne's work,

226
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,373
people just really didn't know
what to think,

227
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,208
because they just
started laughing

228
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,977
at some of these phrases
that were on the wall.

229
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:49,415
- The thing about Wayne is,
he's really funny.

230
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,851
His ideas are really smart.

231
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,354
- I think humor is sacred.

232
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,490
I really do,
and it's my sacred mission.

233
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,892
I think humor is the most
important thing we have

234
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:00,893
as human beings.

235
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,395
It's thought as a lesser thing,

236
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,764
but it's really
our most sacred quality,

237
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,265
and without it,
we're dead.

238
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:10,870
Here's my tribute
to television comedy writing:

239
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,571
<i>[Bleep] Jokes</i>
<i>from sherman oaks.</i>

240
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,440
[Laughter]

241
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,543
There is a pressure
to keep things fresh, yeah,

242
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,579
not to fall into a rut
and just be a one-trick pony,

243
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,115
which a lot of people
think I am, because, you know,

244
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,984
my trademark
is those word paintings,

245
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,986
and they think
that's all I can do,

246
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,187
and they kind of sniff at them.

247
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,655
"Oh, yes.

248
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,759
It's just a cheap trick,"
you know, "blah, blah, blah."

249
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,263
There's a million gripes
for the artist to dwell on.

250
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,831
It's hard.

251
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,833
You have your doubts constantly.

252
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,470
- The first time I saw his work,
it made me laugh.

253
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,538
I thought it was a howl

254
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,239
but it's too easy,

255
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,109
and I didn't think about it
much longer than that.

256
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,510
- The first time I saw them,

257
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,512
I didn't really understand
what I was looking at.

258
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,281
- At first, it was sort of
a head-scratcher,

259
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,349
like, "well, you didn't paint
that whole thing.

260
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,285
You just painted those letters,"
you know.

261
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,886
- You know,
with his work,

262
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,823
it can be easily construed
as a gimmick.

263
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:08,761
The surface of it
seems to appear to be novelty.

264
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,464
- That says, "high & tight."

265
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,533
That says,
"[Bleep] Hounds on parade."

266
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,736
I'll settle for laughter
any day.

267
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,337
Laughter is a deep thing.

268
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,973
Most people don't think it is,
but it is.

269
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,243
- You know, in the art world,
funny isn't taken seriously.

270
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:28,347
People want more
than just a joke.

271
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,816
- There's two beer cans
right here.

272
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,017
The guys who built this,

273
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,588
they had to stay there
all night.

274
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,625
"Entertainment" is a dirty word
in the art world.

275
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,560
You're not supposed
to entertain people.

276
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,596
You're supposed to question
their core values

277
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,397
and make them reevaluate
their lives

278
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,900
and give them a deep insight
into blah, blah, blah,

279
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,035
blah, blah, blah, [Bleep] Blah.

280
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,205
- There is insecurity
in the art world

281
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,510
that real pleasure
or that what we call fun

282
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,679
is not serious, you know,
that it's not intellectual.

283
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,982
- You know,
everybody looks down on comedy,

284
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,052
the oscars and, you know,
my mom, you know, everybody.

285
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,391
- This is the ditch-digging
part of art.

286
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,326
A lot of art is ditch digging.

287
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,863
Most people
want things to be easy.

288
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,065
It's never easy.

289
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,535
Nobody would give me reviews
here in L.A.

290
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,603
I would go out of town
and get all this notice,

291
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,139
but people in L.A.
were slow to notice me.

292
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,674
- One of my first thoughts
was, like,

293
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,812
"wow, these are really funky
updates of ed ruscha,

294
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,548
and he's kind of
the L.A. word master.

295
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,350
- Well, L.A. has this big
hang-up about ed ruscha.

296
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,186
You know, everybody wants
to compare me

297
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,555
to ed [Bleep] ruscha
all the time.

298
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:47,459
- Ruscha is kind of
a giant oak tree,

299
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,297
and when I saw Wayne's work,
my first thought was, like,

300
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,967
"oh, this is a young kid
who loves ruscha

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,436
and is doing something with it.

302
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,606
- And so anytime you get near
the sacred cow of him,

303
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,007
you know, it's like,
"[Bleep] You.

304
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,342
"Back off.

305
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,978
Ed's our man,
and you're just an imitator."

306
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,182
There it is
a couple of days later.

307
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,184
"Hoozy thinky iz?"

308
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,386
- [Laughs]

309
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,623
Made it, ma,
cover of the <i>Nashville scene.</i>

310
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,661
Hey, we should do lbj.

311
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,563
- [Laughs] Lbj.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

312
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,865
Let's do it.

313
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,234
He's on my mind.

314
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,270
Now that I've got a reputation
in the art world,

315
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:35,074
it's time to show some new sides
that I can do.

316
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,909
He's kind of crossing over
from youth

317
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,579
into the classic lbj face
from the '60s.

318
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,917
His head is pretty squarish.

319
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,552
I think a lot of people
just think of me

320
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,088
as the thrift store word guy.

321
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,490
I think that's getting
at his essence, don't you?

322
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,825
- Yeah.

323
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,660
- I'm just kind of
letting my hair down, I think,

324
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,197
and just doing
exactly what I want to do.

325
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,333
Hey, y'all,
wait a minute, now.

326
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,701
Ahh!

327
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,338
Makes no sense, you know,
as far as, like, a career.

328
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,539
I'm lyndon Johnson.

329
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,111
I want your vote
for the congress of Texas.

330
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,982
They didn't seem too excited.

331
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,585
See?
That's what I get at home.

332
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,820
They're so sick of me now.

333
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,557
"Oh,
another thing he did."

334
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,761
Regardless of all that,
I just want to do it

335
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,896
for myself.

336
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,067
It'll be totally different
than what anything

337
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,969
anybody is really doing
in L.A. right now,

338
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:41,573
and it'll be a side of me
that they haven't seen and...

339
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,512
I'm just as insecure
as anybody in a lot of ways.

340
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,315
Everybody's insecure.

341
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,651
But there has to be this
other kind of faith in yourself,

342
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,454
and I always take
this big cosmic view.

343
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,790
Man, you're only gonna be alive,
if you're lucky,

344
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,959
80, 90 years,
and then that's it.

345
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,293
That's all you get.

346
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,695
So why not?

347
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,163
What does it [Bleep] matter?

348
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,799
I can do anything I want to do,
you know?

349
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,634
[Bleep], man, get on it.

350
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,469

He spent a lot of time
in a bowling alley

526
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,567
to not turn out
to be a bowler.

527
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,102
I guess he got sick of it.

528
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,604
I just thought it was a natural
thing for a boy to want to do,

529
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:03,074
you know,
but he didn't really want to.

530
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,444
- To sort of give up on it
on my part

531
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,879
was kind of to give up
on a bond with him, yeah.

532
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,515
The only place I was going
was three or four nights a week

533
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,950
to the bowling alley
with my daddy,

534
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,285
and, of course,
I had to sit there.

535
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,786
I couldn't run around.

536
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,923
So I brought me a big old stack
of notebook paper and pencils,

537
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,460
and I drew.

538
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,862
- [Laughs]
I guess.

539
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,931
- Yes.
Whoo.

540
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:35,207
- This is the Southern daddy
shame ray redneck puppet.

541
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,111
At least since adolescence,

542
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,582
I've been sort of reacting
against things,

543
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,884
and coming from the South,
I reacted against the South

544
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,053
and its string
of authority figures.

545
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,423
He's the--you know,
he's the good classic Southern

546
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,026
authority figure type guy
from my childhood,

547
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,697
a certain type of man
that's sort of fading away.

548
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,734
You look like a woman
with that hair.

549
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,003
That is the shame ray

550
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,607
that different Southern
authority figures can give you.

551
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,141
- I have known guys like that.

552
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,711
My father
is an excellent example,

553
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,113
Wayne's father even more so

554
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,383
because of his silence
and his stoic quality.

555
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,286
- I got to mow that yard.

556
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,823
I got my beans coming in,
my "'maters."

557
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,659
Somebody standing here
saying he's got to paint me.

558
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,663
[Bleep] Damn.

559
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,966
That's him, all right.

560
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,870
When I was hitting puberty,
I would go out way deep,

561
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,641
deep, deep, deep in the woods
and strip naked

562
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,642
and run around.

563
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,011
[Laughing]

564
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,313
Sometimes the dogs
would follow me out there.

565
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,981
The dogs would be,
"ooh, boy."

566
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,149
They loved it.

567
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,751
"He's naked like us.
Let's go."

568
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,953
And I'd be out there
with the dogs howling

569
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,555
and sniffing around.

570
00:25:56,588 --> 00:26:00,458
Just--I was compelled to do it.

571
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,395
You know,
it was a complete

572
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:06,064
sap-rising urge.

573
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,866
- Growing up
in hixson, Tennessee,

574
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,668
you could live
your entire life there

575
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,970
and never look at a work of art.

576
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,206
Art was something
that you bought at K-Mart.

577
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,243
My mother got her art
at K-Mart.

578
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,478
I used to--I remember one day
going with her

579
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,048
to buy a painting at K-Mart

580
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,984
which hung in our house
for many years,

581
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,686
and then when we moved,

582
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,054
it didn't fit the wall
very well,

583
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,389
so she threw it away,
threw it in the trash.

584
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,390
That's art.

585
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,393
[Upbeat bluesy rock music]

586
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,797
d d

587
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,665
- Most of everything
that he did and learned

588
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,467
was--probably a lot of that
was self-taught.

589
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,703
I mean,
there wasn't a lot of influence

590
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,037
in that little town.

591
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,840
- I think artists
in that community

592
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,575
had been seen as curious,

593
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,044
and I think the better
the artist was,

594
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,113
the more curious they became.

595
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,649
- I really couldn't talk
to him about art, I don't guess,

596
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,484
because I didn't understand it
that much,

597
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,487
but we didn't really know
how to relate to him about it,

598
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,688
I don't guess.

599
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,056
- So my high school teacher,

600
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,225
the one time he did try
to directly kind of help me,

601
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,561
I'd done these
Salvador dali drawings.

602
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:13,031
He showed them to my principal,
b.E. Edwards,

603
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,234
this real old-school
Southern hard-ass.

604
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,736
He sits me down,
and he goes,

605
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,372
"your art teacher gave me
some of your drawings you did,"

606
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,675
and he pulls the surrealist
drawings out, and he goes,

607
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,677
"those do not look like
the drawings

608
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,812
of a red-blooded American boy."

609
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,486
I was full-time on rebellious
for three years solid,

610
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,587
10th through 12th.

611
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,955
I mean,
that was my full-time job.

612
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,925
I disgusted him with my hair
and my art.

613
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,327
- It was hard sometimes,

614
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,962
because he did get
into some big trouble.

615
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,331
He got arrested a couple times.

616
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,266
- What was that bad thing
you got into, Wayne?

617
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,501
What was that?

618
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,670
- I stole that mailbox that time
and got arrested.

619
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,104
- Oh, yeah.

620
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,073
- All the Southern daddy
shame rays in my life

621
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,374
were disgusted.

622
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,543
There was a lot of disgust
going on back then.

623
00:27:58,576 --> 00:27:59,544
I mean, literally.

624
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,479
It was just like, "ugh."

625
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,748
They just, "ugh."

626
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,650
But then it turned
into defiance.

627
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,785
"Oh, yeah?

628
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,286
"I'm glad I'm disgusting you.

629
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,888
[Bleep] You,"
you know?

630
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,258
Just the defiance grew
and grew and grew.

631
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,293
I was dying to get out.

632
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:19,431
I was dying to, like, yeah,
get away from that whole place.

633
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:27,238
d Happy Birthday,
Mr. president d

634
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,008
These are, like,
junk sculpture marionettes

635
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,609
made out of found objects,

636
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,346
mostly, like,
sticks and a hammer

637
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,882
and a coconut shell.

638
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,018
Kind of looks like
Michelle pfeiffer.

639
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,288
Odd cutout pieces of junk
that I had laying around:

640
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,590
Pencils, styrofoam, wire.

641
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,459
I love sticks.

642
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,494
I'm always finding them
on the ground

643
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,396
and picking them up
and playing with them.

644
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,500
So this just kind of, like,
was a spontaneous application

645
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,235
of my stick collection.

646
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,939
I started making these
just out of the blue.

647
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,374
I wasn't quite sure
what I was doing.

648
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,777
I really love making them.

649
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,847
That's all I know right now.

650
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,549
Hee, heh-heh, heh-heh.

651
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,017
Right in the middle of the '70s,

652
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,020
I enrolled at middle Tennessee
state university...

653
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,725
Where I pursued my education
in braless hippie chicks.

654
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,995
[Laughter]

655
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,097
This place changed my life
completely.

656
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,666
It was my first time
away from home.

657
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,203
It was my first exposure
to art and culture.

658
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:36,341
So this is where the barn was,
and it was two big roofs

659
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,943
and the two
big giant silos over here.

660
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,880
And right here
was the painting studio.

661
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,715
And this is where I worked a lot
right here.

662
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,150
d Ya-LA-LA d

663
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:49,120
Only imagine me up in the air,
because it was the second floor.

664
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,923
It was very much the era
of the country hippie

665
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,958
when I arrived here in '75.

666
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,095
- And we did
a lot of party stuff,

667
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,830
you know,
that kids may do in college

668
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,166
that don't have better sense.

669
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,868
- God, we did so many
crazy things together.

670
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,505
- So this was my first band
of artists.

671
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,708
Did you say you're some kind
of artist, I hear you say?

672
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,344
We're the people that are tired
of being pushed around.

673
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,148
Whether we were making
snowy monuments to doggy love

674
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,683
or painting crazy cars,

675
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,786
I learned that art could be
a 24-7 lifestyle.

676
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,454
I learned that art
could be fun.

677
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,357
It could be a big part
of your life that never stopped.

678
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,260
- No holds barred,
and if you got an idea

679
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:33,364
to do some crazy performance,
you just did it.

680
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,602
- My name is scary Bobby.

681
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,837
We really lived it.

682
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,505
We really did,
because it was fun.

683
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,874
We had finally found
fellow weirdos

684
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,542
that shared our enthusiasm.

685
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,644
We were all, like,
small-town kids

686
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,847
that finally found
kindred spirits.

687
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,516
What's the world like,
mama?

688
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,286
- We were just goofing around,
having fun.

689
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,724
- This was--this is
a very important place for me.

690
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,200
- It's so nice
to finally meet you.

691
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,435
- It's nice to meet you.

692
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,603
- I've heard a lot about you,
and, of course,

693
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,871
I've enjoyed your work.

694
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,340
We used to watch
<i>pee-wee's playhouse</i>

695
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,908
every Saturday morning.

696
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,276
- He's the voice of the pig...

- Vance, wasn't it?

699
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,280
- Vance the pig.

It's gonna be enchantment.

a magical carpet ride

But as I told him,
that isn't true.

He has a God-given talent,

726

at the very beginning of school,

727
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,016

to my prediction.

Early on,
New York was tough.

789
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,070
I had some work
in <i>high times</i> magazine,

790
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:43,474
but mostly it was just hustling,
handing out xeroxed comics

791
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,810
and trying to make a name
for myself.

792
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,246
Get your free comics.

793
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,848
I was about to pack it all up
and head back to Tennessee

794
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,718
when I remembered I was supposed
to put on a puppet show.

795
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,220
It was called "rootless,"
and it was at this art gallery

796
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,156
called small walls.

797
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,590
So I go to the gallery,

798
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,859
and my girlfriend at the time
didn't show up,

799
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,928
but Mimi did.

800
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,830
- I was feeling pretty cynical
about dating.

801
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,932
Plus, I was really focused
on my career.

802
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,902
- Yeah, Mimi was a star
in the comics world,

803
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,337
way more successful
than I was.

804
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,740
- So my friend asked if I wanted
to go to a puppet show,

805
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,842
and I said,
"yeah, right.

806
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,644
"Maybe I'll meet someone.

807
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,811

808
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,014
Then after the show,
this skinny guy pops up

809
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,416
from behind the stage,
and I thought,

810
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,552

00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,753

comic book star,

00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,158

815
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,626
I couldn't believe it.

816
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,662
Plus,
she had her [Bleep] together.

817
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,231
She had work,
and she had lots of stuff.

818
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,167
- Yeah, I had nice things,
and I could cook,

819
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,403
so I lured him into my lair.

820
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,340

and a vcr!

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,189
and everything
looked like ruins,

871
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,925
a bombed-out Berlin.

872
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,527
- It was a big visual explosion.

873
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,329
Music videos
just had started.

874
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,531
Visually
it was quite exciting.

875
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,900
- Hello.
It's me, pee-wee Herman.

876
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,704
For the next 60 seconds,
mtv will conduct a test

877
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,740
of its own
emergency comedy system.

878
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,910
The sound you hear
is just a test.

879
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,512
Please stand by.

880
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:14,719
Ahhhhh....

881
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,723
Ahh-ahhh-ha.

882
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,724
- I remember walking in.

883
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,826
It was a giant beehive
of a room.

884
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:26,030
Everybody's working on
crazy puppet heads and models,

885
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,265
and models are hanging
from the ceiling,

886
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,735
and half-finished
miniature worlds are everywhere.

887
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:31,936
I mean,
it was classic.

888
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,171
You're just like,
"wow, this is amazing.

889
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,507
Wow, this is, like, fun land."

890
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,076
The minute I saw the scene,
I was like, "yeah, man.

891
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,478
"I got to get in on this.

892
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,679
This is my thing."

893
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,782
- So I started in, like,
April of 1986,

894
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,185
and I interviewed every creative
and film person in New York

895
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,054
and probably 400 people,

896
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:54,225
and Wayne white had the
perfect sensibility for pee-wee.

897
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,893
- I was like,
"oh, it's all coming together

898
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,294
"with those thing,
all these years

899
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,264
"of those stupid puppet shows
done at keg parties

900
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,968
"and galleries and my painting
and the cartooning.

901
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,569
It's all here.
It's all in there."

902
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,405
I went to work the next day.

903
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,413
Here's the visual granddaddies
of <i>pee-wee's playhouse:</i>

904
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,249
Gary panter, Rick heitzman,
and me.

905
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,984
- They all were always
in their, like,

906
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,220
little journals and sketchbooks
sketching up a storm,

907
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,755
extremely prolific.

908
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,457
- They weren't available
for socializing,

909
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,758
because they were working
day and night.

910
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:28,893
- We just drew.

911
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,895
I mean, we all three
just loved to draw,

912
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,064
so it was just, like,
I mean, what could be better?

913
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,467
Make up stuff
that this wacky guy would live--

914
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,835
you know,
how he would live.

915
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,972
- It was a dream job:
Sitting in a room smoking weed,

916
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,574
drawing funny pictures.

917
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,942
Oh,
it was the best.

918
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,777
- Oh, I think, back then,
it was a big lovefest.

919
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,447
All those guys
were like the brothers

920
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,650
they all never had
or something.

921
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,385
- I was put in charge
of the puppets,

922
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,620
stuff like floory
and dirty dog.

923
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,689
I didn't know [Bleep]
about building puppets.

924
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,658
You know,
I just did it my own crazy,

925
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,959
funky, homemade way.

926
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,328
Like, to build dirty dog,
I got an oven mitt

927
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,797
and just glued foam rubber
around the oven mitt.

928
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,468
And I carved Randy out
of a solid piece of white pine.

929
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,837
And his head
weighed about 15 pounds.

930
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,475
And it would keep turning around
on set, on camera.

931
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,544
It would start moving,
and it had a mind of its own.

932
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,513
It would go, like, <i>exorcist.</i>

933
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,215
It would go all the way
around...

934
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,583
"Cut.
What's wrong?"

935
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,750
It's like,
"I don't know what's wrong?"

936
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,152
I knew exac--
I knew what was wrong.

937
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,554
I didn't know what I was doing
is what was wrong.

938
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,122
- Randy was made
a couple of times

939
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,525
or two or three times,
and Randy would fall apart.

940
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,862
- Yeah, you got a block of pine
and a pocketknife?

941
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,997
You know, that was another
little lesson I learned.

942
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,099
Sometimes you've got
to make it up as you go along.

943
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,467
You know what I mean?

944
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,503
- For what they were paying
and getting out of Wayne,

945
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,037
I thought,
"they look great."

946
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,573
- Again, my m.O.:
On-the-job training.

947
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,509
You know, it was like,
"can you make the puppets?"

948
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,510
"Yeah, sure.

949
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,245
I can make puppets,
yeah."

950
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,948
And so one day, Paul is there,
and he's going, like,

951
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,551
"well, do you do voices?

952
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,785
Do you perform?"

953
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,855
I go, "yeah, I do my own
stupid puppet show stuff."

954
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,557
He goes, "okay, let's hear.
Let's..."

955
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,427
And that's where I auditioned
for the puppets.

956
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,596
And oddly enough,
I got the job,

957
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,532
and I became Randy.

958
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,268
Yeah, Randy.

959
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,138
Hey, remember the time I almost
set the playhouse on fire?

960
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,706
That was a close one.

961
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,408
And then I did dirty dog.

962
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:28,646
d Hey, everybody,
gather round d

963
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,083
d to hear a truly groovy
funky sound d

964
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,854
I was flower number three,
one of my feminine roles.

965
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,223
I harmonized with Rick
and Alison on that.

966
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,492
We were the three flowers
sitting there like ass[Bleep].

967
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,493
Presenting...

968
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,561
- Presenting...

969
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:44,695
- Presenting...

970
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,430
It was just, like,
the littlest voice.

971
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,132
- His royal majesty...

972
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,435
All: The king of cartoons.

973
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,237
- We'd sit there all day
doing that.

974
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,705
What a job.

975
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,973
[Laughs]

976
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,376
That whole first season
was crazy.

977
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,477
- It was a joke.

978
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,546
They rented an empty loft
in New York City

979
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,781
on the fifth floor.

980
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,584
- We were literally
in a sweatshop.

981
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,652
- The sewing machines
had just been thrown out.

982
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,054
There was no air-conditioning.

983
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,189
- It didn't even have
the right amount of electricity.

984
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,224
It had never had a stage in it,
and plus,

985
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,260
every 15 feet,
there was a column.

986
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,263
- All day long, we would
have to stop for sound problems.

987
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:24,001
- Paul was in a dressing room
the size of, you know,

988
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,470
the handicap stall
in a men's bathroom.

989
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,006
- We would be down all the time
sitting in the dark

990
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,608
'cause the generators
would blow out.

991
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,842
- Every time I did Randy,

992
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,577
I had to get out
on a diving board

993
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,280
hanging out over the set,
laying on my stomach,

994
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,617
trying to marionette
this crude piece of folk art.

995
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,018
- It was a nightmare.

996
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,486
It was a nightmare for them.
It was a nightmare for Paul.

997
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,555
- I literally slept
in pee-wee's bunk bed.

998
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,224
- Like, it seemed kind of like
a John waters movie, almost,

999
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,793
of, like, designer frenzy.

1000
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,495
- Almost everyone on that show

1001
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,497
was doing their job
for the first time.

1002
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,466
- Tempers were flaring.

1003
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,168
There was a lot
of coke burnouts.

1004
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,905
- It's like getting a job
playing in a sandbox

1005
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,274
but they won't let you out
and they beat you.

1006
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,543
- It wasn't like
a Hollywood production at all.

1007
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,879
It was like a downtown
New York art project,

1008
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,649
and that's what gave it
its power and its edge.

1009
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,218
- It violated
every working code,

1010
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,787
but because it was so creative
and so much fun,

1011
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,322
I didn't care.

1012
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,824
- The minute it aired,
everybody just freaked over it.

1013
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,827
[Upbeat bouncy music]

1014
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,397
d d

1015
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,731
- Ahh!

1016
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,667
- d Come on in
and pull yourself up a chair d

1017
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,102
- Oh, I was a giant fan
of <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

1018
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,303
I loved it.

1019
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,406
I'd get up on Saturday mornings
to watch it.

1020
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,640
- It was a genius show.

1021
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,342
They did an amazing job on it.

1022
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,612
- I thought,
"man, if this can work,

1023
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,415
"if something this great
can actually make it on TV,

1024
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,716
there's hope for us all."

1025
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:49,553
- I loved how completely
off-the-wall it was,

1026
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,722
how it just went anywhere.

1027
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,557
It woke people up
around the country.

1028
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,859
They saw something fresh.

1029
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,262
They saw something
that related to the culture.

1030
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,564
- We were just trying to--

1031
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,800
I use the term
"blow their minds."

1032
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,501
I just, like--
I want to do something

1033
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,036
that people will talk about.

1034
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,172
I want to do something
that people are gonna remember.

1035
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,942
- The <i>pee-wee's playhouse</i> show
was the psychedelic hippie show

1036
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,777
that the hippies wanted to make.

1037
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,446
- The whole idea
was just to make something

1038
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,647
that people wouldn't forget.

1039

00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,948
where I was ignored
like a leprous nerd.

1380
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,849
[Laughs]

1381
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,752
That was the worst night
of my life, those video awards.

1382
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,487
What a crock of [Bleep].

1383
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,056
I'm sorry.
That's too bitter, isn't it?

1384
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,559
d d

1385
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,661
- There aren't
that many great

1386
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:04,167
production designer/
artists/creative thinkers

1387
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,201
out there,

1388
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,569
and so when you find
someone good,

1389
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,104
like Wayne,
you go back to him.

1390
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,440
- That was my first project
with Jonathan and Valerie

1391
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,342
and went on to do several others
with them...

1392
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,811
[Dog barking]

1393
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,580
Like the snapple commercials
with the bottles...

1394
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,515
- [Whistling a sprightly tune]

1395
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,084
- And the old spice commercial,

1396
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,253
and that's when I painted this
60-foot-long schooner sailboat.

1397
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,823
I kept working in kids' TV.

1398
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,625
I did a show
called <i>shining time station.</i>

1399
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,960
Ringo starr
was the tiny little conductor

1400
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,395
that lived in the wall.

1401
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:36,065
I did a show called
<i>riders in the sky</i> for CBS.

1402
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,467
- Good morning, Wayne.

1403
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,235
- Good morning, Doug.
- It's great to see you.

1404
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,537
A Tennessee boy makes good
in the wild and wacky

1405
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,739
wonderful world of Hollywood.

1406
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,841
- It was like
pee-wee goes west, practically,

1407
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,409
as far as the decor.

1408
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,977
It was, like, cowboy kitsch.

1409
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,179
- This is the most beautiful
thing that has ever been seen

1410
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,781
in Hollywood
thanks to Wayne white,

1411
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,849
Tennessee genius.

1412
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,618
- Unfortunately,
the show was a disaster.

1413
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,886
It was a giant bomb.

1414
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,788
There was a lot of bad feelings
around it.

1415
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,456
Everybody was mad at each other.

1416
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,225
- [Bleep] Are you doing,
Wayne, you sucker?

1417
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,559
Man,
you [Bleep] me with this set.

1418
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:04,661
I hate you.

1419
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,262
- It was a lesson,
you know?

1420
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,164
That's what happens
in Hollywood too.

1421
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,832
- You come in
with your dickhead drawings.

1422
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,534
I never see you.
You're always hiding out.

1423
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,003
You're getting too much money
for too little work.

1424
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,271
I ought to kill you.

1425
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,106
I don't ever want
to see you again.

1426
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,008
- And that was my first taste
of how things

1427
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,576
could go horribly wrong.

1428
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,612
I was supposedly hot property,

1429
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,480
because I was
of this generation.

1430
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,116
Of course, everybody wanted
to find the next Matt groening

1431
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,384
and the next <i>Simpsons,</i>

1432
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,986
'cause <i>the Simpsons</i>
had broke big.

1433
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,624
I had done
a five-minute puppet film

1434
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,794
for mtv's
<i>liquid television</i> series.

1435
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,362
It was a thing called
<i>bill and Willis.</i>

1436
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,130
And it was just, like,
all over town

1437
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,699
for 2 1/2, 3 years.

1438
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,300
I did a lot of pitching.

1439
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,003
I was just in and out
of these offices everywhere,

1440
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:52,008
CBS, abc, nbc, nickelodeon,
cartoon network.

1441
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,078
It was a real "banging your head
up against the wall"

1442
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,112
kind of thing.

1443
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,180
I hated that.

1444
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,247
Oh, God.

1445
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,049
That was the worst ever.

1446
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,350
And, of course,
I like to talk

1447
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,987
about my old days in showbiz
with my paintings:

1448
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,023
"All that fake laughin'
for nothin'."

1449
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,424
[Laughter]

1450
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,560
How many times do I sit
in a meeting with some producer

1451
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,195
and he's going, "yeah,
it's gonna be just like <i>pee-wee,</i>

1452
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,529
"you know?

1453
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,098
"It's gonna have, like,
a <i>pee-wee</i> set.

1454
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,101
"He's gonna have a talking dog,
and the kids are gonna come in,

1455
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,635
"and it's gonna be crazy,

1456
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,804
and there's gonna be [Bleep]
coming down from the sky."

1457
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,907
And I'm sitting there going,
"ha-ha-ha-ha, that's great.

1458
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,175
You're gonna pay me, right?"

1459
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,443
[Laughter]

1460
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,412
- You know, I remember
coming out to California

1461
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:30,913
for the first time.

1462
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:34,984
You already are apprehensive
about what it's gonna be like,

1463
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,319
and then you get out here,

1464
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,054
and it's even worse
than you think,

1465
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,923
and it's even more intense
than you think, and it's--

1466
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,659
the business is filthier,
you know, when it's for real.

1467
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:48,664
- There's a lot of ego,
greed, stupidity, and insanity,

1468
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,001
and that's
a really bad combination.

1469
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,937
- He felt like he had
to pursue Hollywood

1470
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:58,341
because that's where he had
to make his livelihood.

1471
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,209
And it was a lot of pressure
on him.

1472
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,711
- I mean,
I don't have enough money

1473
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,979
to sit around and enjoy it.

1474
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:05,381
I got to keep making
that money, you know.

1475
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,483
I don't have "'f' you" money.

1476
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,652
[Laughs]

1477
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,220
I wish I did,

1478
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,156
because I would just say,
"[Bleep] You," to everybody

1479
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,758
and go enjoy it,
but I can't.

1480
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,528
I mean, isn't that the--
that's the American dream.

1481
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,129
"[...] You."

1482
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:23,399
[Laughs]

1483
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,034
Basically, it is.

1484
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:29,505
That's what the American dream
is about: "'F' you" money.

1485
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,108
I would work myself
into exhaustion.

1486
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,410
I got a job in <i>beakman's world</i>
that same year.

1487
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,979
I was, like, this
one-man animation department

1488
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,281
for the show.

1489
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,482
That doesn't work.

1490
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,951
You can't be
a one-man animation department.

1491
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,119
It'll kill you.

1492
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,788
- He really was like a slave
in that place.

1493
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,625
- I did this series for
the Disney channel, <i>circle time.</i>

1494
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,396
That was another project
that spiraled me into craziness.

1495
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,599
I did an offspring video,
<i>she's got issues.</i>

1496
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,068
That [Bleep] place
drove me crazy.

1497
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,104
And I got overworked
and overworked and overworked,

1498
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:04,674
by the time I finished
that offspring video,

1499
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,576
I was out of my mind.

1500
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,312
I had driven myself nutty,
crazy.

1501
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,315
- You need to know when to say,
"I need help,"

1502
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,183
and Wayne liked
to do it all himself.

1503
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,152
- I didn't realize
how hard of work it was

1504
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,956
and how it was going to bruise
my brain like a piece of fruit.

1505
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,391
- I took to calling him
"the thing in the basement,"

1506
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,660
because he--you know, he grew
this long, grizzled beard,

1507
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,495
and he was just doing nothing
but animating

1508
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,699
on this computer downstairs
for weeks at a time.

1509
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:33,536
- I would just be exhausted
and just out of my mind.

1510
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,071
- That would make me
kind of crazy,

1511
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,672
because I would worry
about his health.

1512
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,579
- It was mental.

1513
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,415
It would finally crack.

1514
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,452
I got very depressed
and incapacitated.

1515
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,687
That's when I started
on the happy pills,

1516
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,723
the antidepressants.

1517
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,135
Eventually....

1518
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:10,172
Psssh, psssh!

1519
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,075
Doing!

1520
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,086
- Wayne's got
his video camera on,

1521
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,389
and he's finally making
that video of the house

1522
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:30,493
that he's been threatening to
all this time.

1523
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:34,630
I'm assuming he's gonna bring it
with him.

1524
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,998
Oh, are--

1525
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,037
oh, my God.

1526
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,605
Are you gonna bring the camera
with you?

1527
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,273
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah, he is. Good.

1528
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,042
Now I'll have to look
at myself saying,

1529
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,810
"are you gonna bring the camera
with you?"

1530
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,513
About five times
while we're in New York.

1531
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,151
I couldn't have done any of this
without Mimi.

1532
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:58,120
She's, like, the grown-up
in our relationship.

1533
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,855
- Well, I learned everything
from her.

1534
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,892
She's created
an amazing home life for me.

1535
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,727
- Say, "hi, daddy."

1536
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,632
- She does so many things
that both buoy and support him

1537
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,801
that it wouldn't surprise me
to hear somebody go, like,

1538
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,669
"oh, she's the brains
behind the whole thing."

1539
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:19,675
- I think she affords him
the ability to do what he does.

1540
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,477
- The winner.

1541
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,046
- Mimi is sort of the glue that
kind of keeps everybody moving.

1542
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,849
She's sort of the center
of the universe that, like,

1543
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,384
kind of keeps all the planets
in orbit.

1544
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,187
That goes for the kids
as well as Wayne.

1545
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,556
- She was very serious
about being a good mother

1546
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,659
and a good nurturer to our kids,
and yeah, that took up her time

1547
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,595
that normally would have gone
into artwork,

1548
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,531
so she has paid a price.

1549
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,534
Her career as an artist
did have to kind of be put

1550
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,703
on the back burner
a little bit.

1551
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:51,941
- And here we go.

1552
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,276
There's--
there's the first episode,

Writer: Mimi pond.

1555
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,583
- It's painful to sort of,
like, watch it fall away,

1556
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,885
and you wonder if you're ever
gonna do anything ever again,

1557
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,653
and it's really frustrating.

1558
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,024
There was a point at which
I felt absolutely invisible.

1559
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,859
- Hey,
what are you looking at?

1560
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,228
I was like,
"how badly do I want this career

1561
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:16,932
as a opposed to experiencing
my children's childhood?"

1562
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,734
And that was important to me.

1563
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,070
- I see you.

1564
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,338
- It's hard to be a mom.

1565
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,406
It really is.

1566
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,143
- The compensation is,

1567
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,211
is, we've raised
these two incredible kids,

1568
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,013
and we've had
a lot of happiness.

1569
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,982
- Those letters seem very nice.

1570
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,350
- Yes, aren't they?

1571
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,319
- She's never questioned
any of my moves artistically,

1572
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,155
always supported them.

1573
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,890
Plus,
she's smarter than I am.

1574
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,591
- The handful of artists
that I know

1575
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,062
that have been wildly prolific
have this sort of secret backup

1576
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,597
of this family that's always
been there for them,

1577
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,300
and it certainly is in spades
in the white family.

1578
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,703
- He's already, like, driven
himself crazy most of the time,

1579
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,973

"it's okay."

They're animated.

1612
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,053
You could draw a character,
build a character,

up against the wall hard

1624

to realize things in Hollywood,

1625
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:52,988
and that's the way
Hollywood is, man.

1626
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,124
It's tough,
and I can't whine about it,

because I knew the rules
going in.

1628
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,827
Then I came to the realization

1629
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,030
that I didn't want to work
in Hollywood.

1630
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:04,066
It wasn't worth it to me.

1631
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,702
And the fire went out completely
on that.

1632
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:09,838
So that's when I started
thinking about painting more.

1633
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,407
I just took a break
from the whole thing

1634
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:16,345
and reassessed my whole drive
and what I really wanted.

1635
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,380
I wanted to work by myself
in a studio.

1636
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:21,450
That's what the whole one-man
animation thing was about.

1637
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,386
But see,
it was all wrongheaded.

1638
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,522
And I'd do, like,
civil war battles.

1639
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,390
I did the battle
of lookout Mountain.

1640
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:32,394
I did steamboats
coming down the Tennessee river.

1641
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,730
Here's one called
<i>de soto in Alabama</i>

1642

and <i>young George Washington's</i>
<i>dream</i>

1643
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,401
and for some reason,
this is about two wolfmen

1644
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:41,203
fighting in a room
with historical paintings

1645
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,238

1646
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,440

1650
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,480
The historical scenes
were becoming more surreal.

1651
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:53,616
I was starting to put
weird things in them.

1652
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,485
It was all in the spirit
of absurdity.

1653
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,221
My message was just,
I wanted to have fun.

1654
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,623
Here it is.

1655
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,626
This is one of the original
word paintings that I did.

1656
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,729
It was on paper.

1657
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,432
This was when I was still doing
realist paintings.

1658
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,234
This is the first time
I put words in them.

1659
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,903
Unfortunately it's a sign
that has fallen down

1660
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,139
in the woods mysteriously.

1661
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:21,844
And it says, "a cowardly robot
in a 1930s desert sunset."

1662
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:24,146
I mean, what the [Bleep]
does that mean, right?

1663
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,448
So I started buying
these thrift store paintings

1664
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,783
just for the frames.

1665
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:30,352
And right before
I kicked it out, I thought,

1666
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:33,255
"hmm, you know,
maybe I should just use

1667
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,190
the landscape
that's already in there."

1668
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,227
[Laughter]

1669
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,699
"It would save a lot of time."

1670
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,335
[Laughter and applause]

1671
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,172
Thus was born
my first word painting:

1672
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:53,108
<i>Human [Bleep]ing knowledge.</i>

1673
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,311
[Laughter]

1674
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,512
I thought nothing of it.

1675
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,814
I thought,
"this is just a gag, you know.

1676
01:11:58,847 --> 01:11:59,848
"This is funny.

1677
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,016
Ha-ha.
Look at this."

1678
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,551
People would come by the studio,

1679
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,753
and I would try to show them
my latest opus,

1680
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,923
and they would be more
interested in this word painting

1681
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,491
on the thrift store painting.

1682
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:12,294
More so than any painting
I'd every done.

1683
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,630
I mean,
it was night and day, you know?

1684
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,898
It was weird.

1685
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,067
Before I knew it,
I'd done 10 or 15 of them,

1686
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,869
and I decided to take them down
to a local coffee shop

1687
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,638
called Fred 62.

1688
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,811
- When I designed the place,
I left the walls empty,

1689
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,912
and I thought to myself,

1690
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:31,246
"someone's gonna come
in the door

1691
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,715
with something really cool."

1692
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:35,017
- I started selling them
right off the walls.

1693
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,953
You know, I'd go down there
and have to reach over the table

1694
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,855
where people were eating
and take it down

1695
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:40,856
and put up a new one.

1696
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,157
You know, "excuse me.
Excuse me.

1697
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,459
[Bleep] You."

1698
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,260
You know, 'cause they never
close that place.

1699
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,130
- Generally speaking, if you're
showing in a coffee shop,

1700
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:53,402
you're not gonna end up
on a white-walled gallery,

1701
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,271
but it--it happens.

1702
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,841
- So then there's this packet,

1703
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,843
and it has this name "w. White"
on it.

1704
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,978
I'm like...
So I opened it up,

1705
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:07,583
and there's no--there's no names
on any of the slides.

1706
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:08,817
There's no address.

1707
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,519
There's no phone number.

1708
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,620
There's nothing.

1709
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,122
So I hold it up,
and I'm looking at it,

1710
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,357
and I said, "this is the guy
that has those paintings

1711
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,326
in Fred 62."

1712
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:18,894
- And he was really excited
about them,

1713
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,196
that there was this buzz
about them at Fred's.

1714
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,199
You know, people were talking
about them and stuff,

1715
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,968
complete surprise to me.

1716
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,036
- They're so cool visually.

1717
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,839
They're so ingenious
that they work on that level,

1718
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,008
and then when you
actually read them,

1719
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,245
they're either pointed
or funny or both.

1720
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:37,479
- But at first, I was--
you know,

1721
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:42,351
I was just too much of a snob
to think it was

1722
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:43,419
worth looking at for long.

1723
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:44,953
It was actually--
you know, it was--

1724
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,755
I had the problem,
it was too fun.

1725
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:49,191
- It's kind of, like,
this sense of relief.

1726
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,026
Like, I can go in,
and I can actually kind of have

1727
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,795
a good time in a gallery.

1728
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,229
- And then, you know,
months went by,

1729
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,330
and I saw it somewhere else,
and I'm like,

1730
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,598
"oh there's more there."

1731
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:58,600
Then I started to think
a lot more about it.

1732
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:02,404
I think he's really a poet
as well as a painter

1733
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,541
in the use of his language.

1734
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,344
- I keep a notebook
just of phrases:

1735
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,680
"Pot, cheetos, Dr. pepper,

1736
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,482
<i>"more than a feeling</i>
by Boston,

1737

1738
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,619
my whole life."

1739
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:22,791
You know, my mission
is to bring humor into fine art,

1740
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,561
and that sounds kind of silly,
I know, but I really do.

1741
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,763
I want to bring humor,
and I mean real humor,

1742
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,998
funny stuff,
not art-world funny,

1743
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,066
real-world funny.

1744
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,101
And if you agree with me,

1745
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,771
I think you're gonna come up
against some resistance,

1746
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,573
'cause there's a lot of people
in the art world

1747
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,475
with sticks up their butts,

1748
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,043
and if you meet somebody
like that,

1749
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,544
all you got to do is say,

1750
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:46,248
"I'll smash this painting
over your [Bleep] head."

1751
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:50,052
[Laughter]

1752
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,090
- I saw Wayne's first
New York show, and it was--

1753
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:56,124
I was astonished.

1754
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,559
It really just blew me away,

1755
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:59,428
and I had to find out more
about it and him.

1756
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:03,599
This is called <i>sexy paintings by</i>
<i>sexy painters for sexy people,</i>

1757
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,634
and I always loved
that there's little teeny ghosts

1758
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,270
of the red underpaintings,
which, you know,

1759
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:11,273
indicate very classically
trained painting skills.

1760
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,743
There's nothing amateurish
about anything that he does,

1761
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,012
and this is
seriously skilled work.

1762
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,248
I've done this only a few times
in my life, thankfully,

1763
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,050
but I battled my way in
to meet him.

1764
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,452
- You know,
out comes the drawings,

1765
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,420
and comes the this,
and out comes the that,

1766
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,656
and it's like,
where did he come from?

1767
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,359
- After seeing all that Wayne
had in the studio that day,

1768
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:31,560
it was so clear.

1769
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,328
You know, right away,
I knew that we

1770
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,864
had to do this book.

1771
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:39,134
- It's one those days, a visit,
and your life changes.

1772
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,870
- The title of the book is
<i>maybe now I'll get the respect</i>

1773
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,005
<i>i so richly deserve.</i>

1774
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,339
- Bam.
It happened immediately.

1775
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,841
I mean, it was, like, on it.

1776
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,643
- Bang,
I'm in the art world,

1777
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,644
just like that,

1778
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,078
just like that.

1779
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,414

1782
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,556
Now, I've been doing
these paintings since 1878.

1783
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:04,126
[Laughter]

1784
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:08,497
I've done
approximately 859,372.

1785
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:11,099
When you do that many versions
of the same thing,

1786
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:13,035
you tend to get
a little burnt out.

1787
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,305
And I've been thinking lately
about puppets,

1788
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:19,308
about coming full circle
back to my puppet land.

1789
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,209
And it all started
two years ago

1790
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,679
down at rice university
in Houston

1791
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:26,315
with the biggest puppet
I ever made.

when I was invited here
in June, and, of course,

1803
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,811
it was 102 degrees,

1804
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,113
and I had this George Jones song
stuck in my head,

1805

<i>ragged but right.</i>

[Laughter]

1814
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,699
It is a vulgar
and pernicious thing to do.

1815
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,167
I'm telling you right now.

1816
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,537
It's not important
that I've won

1817
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:26,341
one, two, three emmys
for <i>pee-wee's playhouse.</i>

1818
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,145
It's not important at all

1819
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,014
that I've won

[Laughs]

1827
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,304
That's pretty good, huh?

1828
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,572
[Laughs]

1829
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,580
- I think when you're an artist,
you're in this struggle,

1830
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,582
because you want
to put yourself out there.

1831
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,284
You're doing this thing
that's ultimately

1832
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,920
very self-centered
and narcissistic, right?

1833
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,055
Like, "look at me.

1834
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:14,923
I'm good."

1835
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:17,993
- You know,
there's that part of me that's,

1836
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,196
"shame, shame, shame on you
for getting up there

1837
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,831
"and being the center
of attention,

1838
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,166
"you big show-off.

1839
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,402
Who the--who's he think he is?"

1840
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,771
You know?

1841
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:33,208
- So because you're an artist,
you're also full of self-doubt,

1842
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:36,111
self-loathing,
worrying, neurosis,

1843
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,447
all that stuff,
so you're torn.

1844
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,881
You want to put your stuff
out there

1845
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,883
just because of the exuberance
of being creative,

1846
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:43,351
and then you feel bad
about yourself.

1847
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,487
So I see that in Wayne's work.

1848
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,727
- The "who's he think he is?"
Phantom is always in my head,

1849
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,730
always, even though
I'm looking around and going,

1850
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,099
"well, who's even saying that
to you anymore, Wayne?

1851
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,767
"Your parents
are both applauding you.

01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:03,705
"they're all dead.

01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,875
They don't--
or they don't know who you are."

1856
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,711
It's like, "who is this
'who's he think he is?' Phantom

1857
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,446
still haunting you,
you know?"

1858
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:15,217
I don't know.

1859
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,626
- I keep telling him
how lucky he is.

1860
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,094
How many people
get to experience

1861
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,697
a midlife sudden career change--

1862
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,533
- I've--I know.
I am lucky.

1863
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:34,069
- I tell him how lucky we are
all the time.

1864
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,837
We've been incredibly lucky.

1865
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,074
- I had a second chance that
hardly anybody ever gets, man.

1866
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,375
It's like, who said,

1867
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,778
"there's no second acts
in American life,"

[Laughs]

1871
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,051
- Well, for me,
I feel incredibly proud,

1872
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,419
and I'm incredibly glad.

1873
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,688
- It doesn't seem like
that much time has passed.

1874
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,991
He's managed to put
this thing together,

1875
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,294
you know, and so
I'm wondering now, what next?

1876
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,229
What next?

1877
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,131
- I didn't quite know
where I was going

1878
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:04,332
or what I wanted to do.

1879
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,701
I was kind of figuring it out
as I went along.

1880
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,870
I just kind of follow my heart
and my gut.

1881
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,482
This is exactly it.

1882
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,918
It's what I've wanted
since I was three years old,

1883
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,287
to sit in the room
and draw pictures.

1884
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,558
- I think the future for Wayne
is recognition for the fact

1885
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:35,397
that he was a founding father
of the current state of pop art.

1886
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,932
- And Wayne
is a wonderful puzzle.

1887
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,967
It's like one of those puzzles
you'll never finish,

1888
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,537
because there's always
more pieces to kind of consider.

1889
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,376
- I'm satisfied, yeah.

1890
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,478
I do have
a lot of satisfaction.

1891
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,682
I'm too neurotic to enjoy it
for very long.

1892
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:56,785
- I'm working
on my graphic novel

1893
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,453
that I sold
about a year and a half ago.

1894
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,755
You know, I'm writing.
I'm working. I'm drawing.

1895
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:03,024
So I'm back.

1896
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,427
I'm really thrilled
for his success,

1897
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,797
and I'm really happy
to finally get, you know,

1898
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,132
the respect
I so richly deserve.

1899
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,534
[Laughs]

1900
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:16,605
I just have a feeling
it's all up from here, you know?

1901
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:18,373
I--you know,
and I try not to overthink it

1902
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,674
and look too far
into the future.

1903
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,476
What if this happens,
or what if that happens?

1904
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,744
- I do that.
- That's his job.

1905
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:25,747
I can't--you know,
it's got to be, like,

1906
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,149
one day at a time for me.

1907
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:35,257
- I see myself as, hopefully,
in museums across the world,

1908
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,093
hopefully,
surrounded by grandchildren.

1909
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:41,229
- We never had any idea
that he'd ever go this far,

1910
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,064
but we knew that was all
he was gonna ever do,

1911
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,766
because that's all he ever
wanted to do.

1912
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:49,137
But he wanted it bad enough,
and he went out and did it.

1913
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,338
[Engine thrumming]

1914
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,307
- Onward and upwards.

1915
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:53,508
- I hope Wayne is happy.

1916
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,978
I--I hope everything
goes well for him,

1917
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:58,847
but I hope he's happy.

1918
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,082
I just want him to be happy.

1919
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:05,754
He's got his art,
and that's his life.

[Upbeat music]

1921
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:09,658
- Beauty is embarrassing.

1922
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,661
Now,
what do I mean by that?

1923
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:15,797
Beauty is a many-pronged thing,
you know?

1924
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,198
It has many sides to it.

1925
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:20,335
When we see something beautiful,
truly beautiful,

1926
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:21,569
we're in awe,

1927
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,039
and raw emotion
comes to the surface.

1928
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,808
We're also humbled by it.

1929
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,109
We're not worthy.

1930
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:32,113
That emotional vulnerability,
that insecurity,

1931
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,716
those are both
embarrassing situations.

1932
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,651
"If only I could make
something that beautiful,"

1933
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,053
or,
"if only I was that beautiful."

1934
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,988
So we're sort of embarrassed
for ourselves

1935
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,856
when we're struck
by true beauty.

1936
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:46,995
Artists and creative people
are people who make beauty.

1937
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:49,364
Now, that's the bottom line.

1938
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:50,498
I mean,
that's what we do.

1939
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,000
We make beauty.

1940
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,636
I've been trying to make beauty
my whole life,

1941
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:58,006
and just to even say that
is embarrassing, but I have.

1942
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,408
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1943
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,745
I owe you a very big debt
of gratitude,

1944
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,680
'cause this is a rare
and special time

1945
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,148
for me right now.

1946
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:08,850
You let me stand up here

1947
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,919
and show you
all my beautiful things,

1948
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:14,122
and I didn't
get embarrassed once.

1949
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,157
Follow your heart
and your pleasure in art.

is gonna be making you money

want you to do

1952

thinks you should be doing.

Do what you love.

1955
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:26,835
It's gonna lead
to where you want to go.

1956

more beautiful.
