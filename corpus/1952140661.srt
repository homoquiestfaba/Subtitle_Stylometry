1
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:35,697
Barkeep, what's
the drunkest I can get for, um,

2
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:37,205
two bucks?

3
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:38,604
For two bucks I can let you drink

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,801
everything that spilled
on my overpour mat tonight...

5
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,310
Splatmat Special.

6
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:44,812
That sounds terrible.

7
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:47,111
Bring it.

8
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,698
- Third-wheeling it, huh?
- Huh?

9
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,996
Oh, yeah.
They're just friends from work.

10
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,437
You want some advice?

11
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:13,236
Watch your back
around those two.

12
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:17,109
- Watch my back?
- Couples are not to be trusted.

13
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,548
We just work together.

14
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,607
Yeah, it all seems innocent,

15
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,915
till one day
you're sitting in a bar,

16
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,354
telling a stranger about
how your life got ruined.

17
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,086
- You don't have to tell...
- It all started four months ago.

18
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,740
Karen Elizabeth Beale,

19
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:52,338
will you do me the great honor
of marrying me?

20
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,084
(retches)

21
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,319
Look what you've done
to Alfonse!

22
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,402
Hey, you know,
it could have been worse.

23
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:22,432
How?

24
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,673
Technically she never said no.

25
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:27,408
Maybe it was too soon.

26
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,543
Too soon? We've been
dating for three months.

27
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,053
Almost.

28
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,988
I think anything under
a solid decade is impetuous,

29
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,355
if not downright irresponsible.

30
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:40,122
I'm sorry about this, man.
This is such bad timing.

31
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:42,426
I wish I could be here for
you right now, but...

32
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:44,955
No, I know. Look, it's fine.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,331
I know how long you've
wanted this job, so...

34
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:51,863
Yeah well, if you ever
find yourself in central Germany,

35
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:53,465
you know,
schtop by!

36
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,170
Yeah, for sure.

37
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,469
(horn honks)

38
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,846
Hey, do you mind?

39
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:02,646
We're having
a modern male moment here!

40
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,847
Take your time, Mr. Sensitive.
It's not my flight we're gonna miss.

41
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,823
Oh shit. Um, okay, I gotta bolt.

42
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,620
You sure you're gonna be okay?

43
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,887
Yeah, I'll be fine.

44
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:15,055
Oh, listen. Don't go falling for the
first girl that comes along, okay?

45
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:18,498
I know how you get.
All that hopeless romantic shit

46
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,092
will get you in nothing but trouble.

47
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:22,501
Trust me. Any shred of romance
that was left in me

48
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:24,062
was ground to
a bloody pulp yesterday.

49
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:25,733
Oh, good.

50
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:27,833
I mean, not good. I mean...

51
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,571
fuck, you know what I mean.

52
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:32,512
Well, auf wiedersehen.

53
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:34,209
Eat some schnitzel for me
or something.

54
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,807
Aye. Be well.

55
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,418
And stay out of trouble.

56
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,549
(groans)

57
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:50,130
(western movie on TV)

58
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,427
(coughs)

59
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,665
Echo?

60
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:02,133
# La la la la #

61
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,441
- # La la la la #
- (banging on ceiling)

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,449
Knock it off, fuckhead!

63
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,383
(softly)
#La la la la #

64
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,547
Asshole.

65
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,252
She won't let you out
for one beer?

66
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:19,317
Come on. What's that all about?

67
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,459
No, I'm not calling your wife a bitch.

68
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:23,794
No no no...

69
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,231
Hello?

70
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,861
Come on, man.
How long have we been friends?

71
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:30,838
Okay. How long have
we been acquaintances?

72
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:34,774
Scott Teller. I bought
your futon a few years ago.

73
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,176
# Last night
I picked up the phone #

74
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:39,703
# Late call said
you were alone #

75
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,648
# Crying to me about #

76
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:44,516
# All of the things that we said #

77
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,987
# Apologized
for your ways #

78
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:49,320
# Said that you hadn't
slept in days #

79
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,848
# Said that you need me... #

80
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:53,190
Hey. I'm Nina.

81
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:56,322
Hi. Hi, Nina. I'm Scott.

82
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,993
I know this is
incredibly forward, but

83
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,969
I think you're really cute
and I was just wondering

84
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:03,369
if you'd maybe like to go out.

85
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,838
I'd love you.

86
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,008
I mean, I'd love to

87
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:09,874
go out sometime.
(chuckles)

88
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,880
Not to say that I couldn't
love you at some point.

89
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:16,315
It's just, you know,
life is a very funny thing.

90
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:17,943
You never know what's
going to happen next.

91
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:21,513
Nina?

92
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:24,354
# So I came back,
opened my mind #

93
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:26,793
# Decided to
give you the time #

94
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,591
# To make it up to me #

95
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,155
# And not turn away... #

96
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,297
I gotta get a roommate.

97
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,107
You know, the best way
for me to introduce myself

98
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:41,939
would be to do a monologue.

99
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:42,966
Okay.

100
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,178
As she leads me to her bed,

101
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:51,014
I see for the first time

102
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:55,490
piles and piles of pink panties.

103
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,889
Heh.

104
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:58,893
Harold just has difficulty
communicating with others.

105
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,724
- Mmm.
- Don't you, Harold?

106
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:01,854
Mmm...

107
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:15,676
My vagina is unto the world's

108
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,338
vagina!

109
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,040
I live just around the corner,

110
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,345
so I can visit all the time.

111
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,945
Thank you.

112
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,424
Ryan Beckett.

113
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:35,191
Mary Kincaid. Hi.

114
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,063
Hi. Scott Teller.
Nice to meet you.

115
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,831
So, this place is awesome.

116
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,498
I was looking for a change last year,
so I moved downtown.

117
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,667
I'm a senior product reviewer
for "Open Collar Worker."

118
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,042
It's a magazine for work-at-home
professionals.

119
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,876
How do you like working
from home?

120
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,882
I won't lie to you.

121
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,110
It gets Ionely sometimes.

122
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,248
Which one of you is interested
in the apartment?

123
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,587
- Actually...
- Both of us.

124
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,459
To be honest, I'm not really sure
about living with a couple.

125
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:11,330
No offense, but it seems like
it could get kind of awkward.

126
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,727
Is everything okay?

127
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,968
Yeah. We've just been
having a hard time

128
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,441
trying to find a place.

129
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:26,607
Yeah, and we're really into the whole
downtown loft thing, so...

130
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,411
Yeah.

131
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:36,656
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

132
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,454
No, it's just your beard...

133
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:40,222
Yeah, that.

134
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:44,130
It itches like a bastard.
I don't know why I keep it.

135
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,828
Someone on the street yesterday
called me "Vermont Guy."

136
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,197
I keep meaning to shave it off,

137
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:52,570
but I guess I really haven't
had a reason to,

138
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:55,007
not since Karen...

139
00:07:56,812 --> 00:08:00,441
but I don't want to bore you
with that story.

140
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:04,851
Uh, no. We're not in
any rush, Scott. Try us.

141
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,854
You can tell us, Scott.

142
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,817
Okay.

143
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,758
(music playing)

144
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:15,359
# We sit around #

145
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:19,925
# Looking for flaws
in the diamonds #

146
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:25,600
# We sit around spilling our
ice cubes on the lawn #

147
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,632
# We sit around
fighting our way #

148
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:32,238
# Through the darkness #

149
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,113
# And we waste our time #

150
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,314
# When we could be
righting every wrong #

151
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,157
# And we trace heartbreak
where we #

152
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:48,219
# Can see heartbreak
don't belong... #

153
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:52,597
- Drum roll, please. Here he comes.
- (vocalizes drum roll)

154
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,295
- Yay!
- Hey!

155
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,031
Much much better.

156
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:59,768
Yeah, considerably less
"creepy shut-in" with this look.

157
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:02,140
That's exactly what I was going for.
Thanks.

158
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:05,237
Well, this was really fun
meeting like this.

159
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,804
- We should get going.
- We should.

160
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:10,978
Hey, listen. Here is our card.

161
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,455
Yeah, call us sometime if you
want to do something,

162
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:17,014
or just talk.

163
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,491
Good luck with
the roomie search.

164
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:22,360
Whoever you find is lucky to live
with a guy like you.

165
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,767
Hey, guys, let's do it.

166
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:30,964
Why don't you move in?

167
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,608
Scott, are you sure?

168
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:36,543
You guys are the
nicest people I've met,

169
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:39,172
and let's face it... you're
the nicest people I'm gonna meet.

170
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:41,774
This place is totally big enough
for the three of us.

171
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:44,979
Scott, you are not gonna regret this!

172
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,318
We will totally keep
to ourselves. It will be like

173
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,982
- having just one roommate.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:50,321
When can you guys move in?

175
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,155
- This weekend?
- Yeah?

176
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,683
- This weekend!
- Great!

177
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:54,717
I'll see you then.

178
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,526
- All right!
- Awesome!

179
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:59,260
Okay. See ya!

180
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:00,700
See you soon.

181
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:19,050
I can't believe how well our colors
work together. We're both autumns.

182
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,179
Is that fate or what?

183
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,156
Uh, yeah. Looks great.

184
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,388
Give him a break, Mary.
He's only got one X chromosome,

185
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:29,522
which is why he is much more
interested in this bad boy!

186
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:31,555
Holy crap!

187
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:36,308
Well, I am just so glad to see

188
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,650
that you two stayed together.

189
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:41,918
Yeah, it really looked like
you guys

190
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,517
were on the ropes
there for a little while, so...

191
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:50,655
Well, fortunately Nerissa has
a high bullshit threshold.

192
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,688
Aww.

193
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,134
Come on, you two
scallywags, join us.

194
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,363
What?

195
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,962
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

196
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,940
I know I always do this.
I know I suck. I'm so sorry,

197
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,874
but it really isn't my fault.
I was driving here from work

198
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,140
and I was on the PCH and
the traffic suddenly stopped

199
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:06,978
and there was a turned-over beekeeper's
truck from some almond farm up north

200
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,449
and there was a cop
who was supposed to be

201
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:09,542
directing traffic
around the truck

202
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,576
and he's swatting at all the bees.

203
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,817
Everybody gets confused,
and there's like six more accidents

204
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,415
so there was honey
all over the cars.

205
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,154
Ted, it was not my fault this time,
I swear to God. It was not my fault.

206
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21,492
Okay, calm down. We have
a couple of minutes.

207
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,054
Calm down.

208
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:27,228
Tat's the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard. That's awesome.

209
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,463
I'm gonna use that one
the next time I'm late.

210
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,267
Are you accusing me of lying?

211
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:34,208
No. That's what's perfect about it.
You couldn't make that up.

212
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,940
You'd be surprised.
I am the master of excuses.

213
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,709
All right, what's
your best one?

214
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:41,409
My best one?
Dude, it would dazzle you

215
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,747
and I don't think
you could handle it.

216
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,309
I've got an idea.

217
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:47,186
How about we have a date,

218
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:50,350
Saturday night, 8:00, here?

219
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,586
You come at 9:30
and dazzle me.

220
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,290
- This guy's got game.
- Yeah.

221
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,629
Uh, do we know this guy?

222
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,931
Leslie, these are my friends
from UCLA, Ryan and Mary.

223
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,403
- Friends? Really?
- Stop it, please.

224
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,373
Hi. And this is
our roommate Scott.

225
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,376
He is a good man.

226
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,402
Vouchers. I like vouchers,

227
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:16,214
but I gotta say no, because I'm not into
the one-on-one thing with a stranger.

228
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:19,084
Okay. Well, we'll all go,
all six of us.

229
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,919
- Right? Saturday.
- We're busy.

230
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,720
- Honey.
- No, we are.

231
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,226
We have that thing
with Phil and Barbara Griffin.

232
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,693
We could go.

233
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:27,753
- Yeah.
- Huh?

234
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,161
Yeah, sure.

235
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,292
Chaperones.
Are we on?

236
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:36,961
Uh, nnnnn... okay.

237
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,803
Why not?

238
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,169
But we're late
because of the bees,

239
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:44,577
- so...
- Ted: Bye.

240
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:47,639
Good. No chance for me
to say anything stupid.

241
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,173
I'll see you on Saturday...

242
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:51,709
- Oh, Leslie Green.
- Leslie.

243
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,484
- Scott Teller.
- Scott Teller.

244
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,515
- See you Saturday.
- See you Saturday.

245
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:00,987
- Bye.
- Bye.

246
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,497
See ya Saturday.

247
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,064
Scotty Scott Scotterton
over here! Scotterino!

248
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,572
Way to get back
in the saddle, partner!

249
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,199
- I'll say. Giddyup, huh?
- Huh?

250
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:14,573
Did you see that?

251
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,635
Who's got two thumbs
and is impressed?

252
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,840
- (whispers) This guy.
- (whispers) Yeah.

253
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,217
(utensils clanking)

254
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,750
(Ryan snickering)

255
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,888
- You've been a bad girl.
- That'll work.

256
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,056
- That'll work.
- Yeah.

257
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,123
Oh! Aha!

258
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,032
- The whisk.
- (squeals)

259
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,866
- (giggling)
- (squealing)

260
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,893
(whip snaps)

261
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,498
You gonna take me
downtown, Officer?

262
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,409
- I'm taking you all the way down!
- Mary: Yeah!

263
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,247
Ryan: There was a farmer
who tapped that ass...

264
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:55,580
Mary:
...and Ryan was his name... oh!!

265
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,414
(rock song on jukebox)

266
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,428
(singing along)

267
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:25,341
Both:
#I'm gonna take you take you home. #

268
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,506
- Unh!
- Nice!

269
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:28,277
- Harmonies. What?
- Unh!

270
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,478
- Scott. Scotty!
- Huh?

271
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,953
- Nervous, buddy?
- Flutterbies?

272
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:34,182
- Mmm?
- Mmm?

273
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,748
Um, yeah, a little bit, I guess.

274
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,023
- I'd be nervous.
- I'd be going apeshit.

275
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:42,257
I'm talking fucking apeshit!

276
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,595
Ryan: Yeah.

277
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,831
- Hi.
- Hey.

278
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,307
- Hey.
- Hi.

279
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:57,836
Hey! How are you?

280
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,041
- Flaming Gorilla Nipple?
- Uh, no, that's okay.

281
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,141
I see you guys
started without me.

282
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:05,381
Well, it was 5:00
somewhere, right?

283
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,051
I don't even drink anymore.

284
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,183
Of course I don't
drink any less, either.

285
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,214
Hiyo! What are you drinking?

286
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,727
Probably just a glass of red wine.

287
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:14,422
- Mmm.
- Ooh.

288
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:18,627
Scotty Dog is not much
of a wine drinker.

289
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,694
- The tannins give him headaches.
- He's more of a beer guy.

290
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:25,206
Thanks, guys.
I can speak for myself.

291
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,037
Of course you can!

292
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,305
If there's anything
Scott can do,

293
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,539
it's talk... a lot.

294
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,845
Like, yap yap yap yap.
He is a regular little chatterbox.

295
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:37,147
Like a chihuahua.
Show her!

296
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,082
Yeah, come on,
say something, hotshot.

297
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:43,756
Mary: Oh!

298
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,292
Mary: Watch this!

299
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,318
This will be good.

300
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,565
Here it comes.

301
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,060
Really?

302
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,262
How have you been?

303
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:59,206
(both exclaim)

304
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,675
- Brilliant!
- The man should be a writer.

305
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,200
Hemingway
over here, right?

306
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,735
Guys, really, I...

307
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,441
- So how have you been, Les?
- Mmm.

308
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:09,382
Oh. Uh, I've been good.

309
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:12,148
Can't say I love being called Les.

310
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:15,315
- Oh! Hmm!
- I know what you're saying there.

311
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:19,123
I can't stand it when
people call me Mare.

312
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,061
- Yes.
- It's like, what am I?

313
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:22,495
- Right.
- Am I a horse?

314
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,829
- No.
- Am I some kind of horse,

315
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,358
- like a pony?
- Or like some kind of

316
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:29,836
mare or something,
you know?

317
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:33,103
Guys, I don't think this whole
double-date thing is working out.

318
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:34,301
We're gonna get going.

319
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,140
- What?
- Why?

320
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,112
You guys are shitfaced.

321
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:41,206
How dare you?

322
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,810
That is silly.
(mouths)

323
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,582
I am sober as a fucking judge!

324
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:49,352
I think it's fine.
They're just a little drunk.

325
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,653
We've all been there.

326
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:53,252
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

327
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,126
- Oh!
- (Leslie screams)

328
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,222
Oh, God! You know what
we gotta do?

329
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,790
- Say it.
- Mexican food.

330
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,802
- Unh!
- That does sound good!

331
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:03,396
We have to go get Mexican food.

332
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:04,427
It's so good.

333
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,441
- I don't know, guys...
- We should do it.

334
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,466
- Shall we vamanos?
- Both: Yes!

335
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,341
- Mary: Si, senorita.
- Vamanos.

336
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,973
I know the best spot.
We could take a taxi.

337
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,004
- Yes.
- And that way

338
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,038
we'll get fucking hammered.

339
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,311
- So fu...
- king...

340
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:19,149
hammered! Oh!

341
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:20,620
- (Ryan snickers)
- Leslie: I love the sound of this.

342
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,181
- (Mary squeals)
- Ryan: Oh, boy.

343
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,817
Somebody get this guy
a fucking drink.

344
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,694
- Mary: You should sleep with him.
- Sleep with him.

345
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,856
- He's awesome.
- Mary: Yeah!

346
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,126
They crack me up.

347
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,758
Mary: Everybody in the
bar have sex tonight.

348
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,792
Leslie:
Ryan, what do you do?

349
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:37,771
Mary and I are in contract law.

350
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,240
- We're both paralegals.
- Leslie: Hmm.

351
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,470
But we'll probably be going back
to law school soon.

352
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,172
Leslie: Oh? What school
do you want to go to?

353
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,680
Wait a minute.
Diddling?

354
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,012
Yeah, diddling.

355
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,484
- You know, with...
- I know what it means.

356
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,977
- I can't believe you just sat there.
- I didn't!

357
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:58,288
Well, Stanford's the dream,
but it's pretty expensive.

358
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,993
(whispers)
I know. Fuck yeah.

359
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,431
- (squeals)
- You okay, Mary?

360
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,457
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

361
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,366
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

362
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:12,164
- Driver, turn left here. It's quicker.
- (moans)

363
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,231
And you didn't say anything?

364
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,038
What was I supposed to do,

365
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,342
let Leslie know that a fingerbanging was
happening a foot and a half behind her?

366
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,042
That's not first-date material, bro.
I mean, come on.

367
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,519
I'm sorry. Please continue.

368
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,043
So have you guys
ever thought about

369
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,420
one of you going to school
while the other one works?

370
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:29,719
Uh-huh.

371
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:32,022
What, you mean like one of us go
and the other one stay?

372
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,220
- Mary: Mmm.
- Yeah, you know, take turns.

373
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:37,664
Mary: Yes! Yes!
Definitely!

374
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,894
Well, it sounds like
Mary likes the idea.

375
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,163
Mary:
Mm-hmm. (gasps)

376
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,375
Oh! Wow!

377
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:03,388
(laughs) They're really drunk,
aren't they?

378
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,950
Yeah.

379
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:08,485
Uh, she's a little, uh...

380
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,328
tired, so I think we're just gonna

381
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,164
go home and hit the sackaroo.

382
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:15,601
You guys are cool
to get home, right?

383
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:16,797
Safely? Safely? Safely?

384
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:19,033
Yeah, we can do that.

385
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,134
- Okay. I will check you later, bro.
- (squeals)

386
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,113
Mary:
Let's go home.

387
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,448
- Hasta lasagna!
- Bye now! (squeals)

388
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,721
That was weird.

389
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,160
You have no idea.

390
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,731
So, the three of you
spend a lot of time together?

391
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,790
Um, yeah.

392
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,859
I mean, we have.

393
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,370
Maybe that's a little strange.

394
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,373
Mmm. I get it. I've been the
third wheel with Ted and Nerissa

395
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,840
way more times
than I want to admit.

396
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,606
Well, tonight notwithstanding,
Ryan and Mary are good people.

397
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:02,310
Very perky, maybe
a little too perfect,

398
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,478
if you know what I mean.

399
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,045
Well, the way Ted explains it,
they might as well be the Antichrist.

400
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,456
- What?
- Oh, don't take Ted seriously.

401
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,858
He is a cynic with
a flair for the dramatic.

402
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:16,091
Nerissa says they're good people,
and that's good enough for me.

403
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,793
Well, next time we go out,
it's just the two of us.

404
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,928
Oh, so there's gonna be
a next time, huh?

405
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,030
Yeah. You can't let
tonight be the end of it.

406
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,372
I mean, this has
just been ridiculous.

407
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,109
What are you
doing tomorrow?

408
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,978
Something with you, I hope.

409
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,473
Wow, you really play
hard to get, don't you?

410
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,956
Okay, well, in that case,

411
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,618
you should come by
at 6:00.

412
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,059
I'm there.

413
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,563
Cool.

414
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:50,997
What?

415
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:54,058
Nothing. I just...

416
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:56,935
I just realized I probably
should have waited

417
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,600
till the end of the date
to ask you on a second date,

418
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,439
'cause now there's no buildup,

419
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,604
there's no tension,
there's no mystery.

420
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,848
How great is that?

421
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:21,885
Wow!

422
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,831
- Hey!
- Scott!

423
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,395
Hi. We are so so

424
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:33,407
so sorry about last night.

425
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:36,069
Yeah, we were
way over the line.

426
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,102
I don't know what happens
to me when I drink.

427
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:41,547
- I just get so H-O-R-N-Y.
- Yeah,

428
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:46,247
and I am a total man-whore
after four cocktails.

429
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:48,518
We practice hot monogamy.

430
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,548
I'm what you'd call
a monogamist slut.

431
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:54,585
One of the pillars of our relationship.
It keeps it spicy.

432
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:55,618
- Mmm.
- Huh?

433
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:56,961
And it doesn't hurt that I rarely

434
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:59,592
- if ever wear panties for him.
- No it does not.

435
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,228
You must think
that we are total pervs.

436
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,761
The whole thing
must seem so tawdry.

437
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,036
Ooh! Tawdry.
Fantastic word.

438
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,508
- It's awesome, right?
- That is an awesome word.

439
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:12,343
Guys, let's just try to establish and
respect some boundaries, all right?

440
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,905
- Can do, Mr. Magoo.
- Absolutely.

441
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,044
And to make it up to you,
we made brunch.

442
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,485
I can see that.

443
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,079
I could see that from space.

444
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:24,023
- Diggith inneth.
- Bon appétit.

445
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:28,018
- Mary: We need more eggs.
- Ryan: Eggsellent idea.

446
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,555
- Mary: My thoughts eggsactly.
- Guys, really,

447
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,999
none of this was
necessary. I...

448
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,033
Um...

449
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:43,135
you know, the less we talk or think
or remember about last night the better.

450
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:45,738
We just feel terrible

451
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,214
that we ruined it for you
with Lisa.

452
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,481
Leslie. And, um,
you didn't ruin anything.

453
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,009
We're going out tonight.

454
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,946
Wow,

455
00:22:56,992 --> 00:23:00,052
two dates in two days.

456
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,255
Jesus H. Christ, Scott,

457
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,264
I thought we weren't gonna
rush into anything this time.

458
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,257
I'm not rushing into anything.
It's more of a do-over date anyway.

459
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,999
Whatever. It's like you want
to get your heart broken again.

460
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,135
Scott, uh, what about
the guy code?

461
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,942
You don't even call the girl the next
day, let alone go out with her.

462
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,174
You're never gonna
get rid of her now.

463
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:22,445
I'm not really a guy-code guy, Ryan.

464
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,452
I like to play it by ear.

465
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,386
Yeah. That's been
real successful so far.

466
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:28,616
- Mary!
- Dude, she's kidding.

467
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,990
She's kidding. I mean,
she is and she isn't.

468
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,018
I am and I amn't.

469
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:36,553
Look, thank you for breakfast,
but I'd like to drop the subject now.

470
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,826
- It's dropped.
- Like a bad habit.

471
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,198
- Like a hot potato.
- Like an atom bomb.

472
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,964
- Like a prom dress.
- Like a...

473
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,129
(slams glass)

474
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,934
Well, it looks like
somebody got up

475
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,103
on the wrong side
of the bed this morning.

476
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,373
Your eggs are getting cold, Scott.

477
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,955
Man on TV: Other lightweight vacuums
are light on power.

478
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:07,053
That's why Dyson
engineered the Dyson Slim...

479
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:08,562
See you all later.

480
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:10,587
Wait!

481
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:12,759
- We have to come with you.
- Why?

482
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,998
To apologize to Leslie.

483
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,028
That won't be necessary.

484
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,974
I know, but it would just make
us both feel so much better.

485
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,876
Yeah. We got off
on the wrong foot.

486
00:24:23,912 --> 00:24:25,709
Such the wrong foot.

487
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,849
Okay.

488
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:32,375
But you leave after the apology,
and absolutely no drinks.

489
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,980
Don't worry, we'll be good.
I'm even wearing panties today.

490
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:36,513
- (squeals)
- Scott: Ow.

491
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,695
It just keeps coming.

492
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,721
Look, I really want to spend
some time with her.

493
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,164
Alone.

494
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,794
- Right. Say, Ryan?
- Hmm?

495
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:49,633
What's the name of
the Canadian rock trio

496
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:50,933
that recorded the song
"Tom Sawyer"?

497
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,634
Why, Mary, that would be
Rush.

498
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:55,905
Which is exactly what
Scott is doing with Leslie.

499
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,540
Okay, you guys clearly
planned that, and that's just odd.

500
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:03,506
Come on.

501
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:17,763
She stood you up, man.

502
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,064
- Left you hanging.
- High and dry.

503
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,093
I feel awful.

504
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,402
This is obviously our fault.

505
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,101
Oh, man, this sucks.

506
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,167
So what do you say we go get
a drink or 12, nurse the wounds?

507
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,075
- All you can do, really. Right?
- Yes.

508
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,204
Shall we?

509
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:34,971
Hi!

510
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,415
Are you here to see someone?

511
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,850
Uh, yes. Leslie.

512
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:39,478
Leslie Galinsky?

513
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:40,852
No, Leslie Green.

514
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,983
Oh, Leslie G.
You must be Scott.

515
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:45,083
Come on in.

516
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,423
Thanks.

517
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:49,827
Oh, I'm sorry.
Invited guests only.

518
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,456
We're with Scotty.

519
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,195
I'm just a woodland nymph
with five lines, so...

520
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,007
- Bye.
- Thank you.

521
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:15,282
Oh, hey, you made it.

522
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,314
Hey, yeah, I did.

523
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:18,552
Sorry to drag you by work like this

524
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:19,992
but we've been
so pressed for time

525
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,586
I've had very little
social life lately.

526
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:25,531
- This is work?
- Oh, yes. I do costumes.

527
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,468
I am the seamstress
to the semi-stars.

528
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,697
Cool.

529
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:33,002
But I thought maybe you'd want
to see the dress rehearsal, so

530
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,770
I put together some snacks.

531
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:38,736
And I brought some wine...
and beer,

532
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,475
because I know
you are a beer man.

533
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,512
Is that cool?

534
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:46,349
Yeah. That'll do.

535
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,218
Okay, well, let's get a seat.

536
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,940
Woman:
Leslie!

537
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,579
Leslie!

538
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:22,385
We're sorry!
We're so sorry.

539
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:25,187
- It's all on us.
- Our bad, not Scott.

540
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,625
- Oh my God.
- Ryan: Leslie Green!

541
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,629
- Mary: Not Galinksky!
- Ryan: No, you're cool, Galinsky!

542
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,188
Scott didn't do anything!

543
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,133
So if you were planning
on hooking up or making out...

544
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:35,760
Mary: Or going all the way
or whatever...

545
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:38,237
- Ryan: Full speed ahead!
- (all groaning)

546
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:40,366
Thumbs up
if you can hear us.

547
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,773
Mary: Groovy?

548
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,367
Ryan: Dude playing Puck,

549
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,242
- you are awesome!
- Great!

550
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,805
- Scotty, we'll see you at home.
- They gave the thumbs up, right?

551
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,373
- Yeah.
- Okay.

552
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,949
Fantastic.

553
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,515
(groans)

554
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,987
Again, I'm sorry
about Ryan and Mary.

555
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:29,251
Just forget about it.
I don't want to get worked up over it,

556
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:34,159
let some gut-wrenching, potentially
job-threatening embarrassment

557
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,560
ruin a good date.

558
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,121
Good date? Come on,

559
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:39,395
this is undoubtedly the best date
that I've ever been on.

560
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:42,232
Yeah, I kind of
impressed myself tonight.

561
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,501
Yeah. I mean, the bar
has been set ridiculously high.

562
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,100
I'm clearly gonna have to involve
air travel on our next date

563
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,131
if I even hope to top this.

564
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:52,704
Well I don't know about air travel,
but...

565
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:56,650
how do you feel
about a wedding?

566
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,343
Ours?

567
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:01,355
No.

568
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,220
Ted and Nerissa are getting
married in two weeks

569
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:04,383
and I'm the maid of honor.

570
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:08,521
And I don't have a date.

571
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:11,999
And I kind of don't think
I'm gonna meet anyone

572
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,933
I'm gonna want to go with
more than you before then,

573
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:18,871
so come with me.

574
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:22,933
Yeah, absolutely. Weddings
are a total turn-on for chicks.

575
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:25,104
You don't
stand a chance after that.

576
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,580
(laughs)
I like this.

577
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:31,642
- What?
- That I can tell you that I like you

578
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,281
and not have to worry
that I'm gonna regret it later.

579
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,052
No, you definitely won't.

580
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:40,254
I feel like I don't have
to play games with you.

581
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:43,229
I don't have to couch anything.

582
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:45,494
I don't even know
what couch means as a verb.

583
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,400
So, no,

584
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:50,199
you definitely don't have
to do that.

585
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:59,713
- (horn honks)
- Woman: Leslie, time to go!

586
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:02,910
Oh, that's my ride.

587
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,043
I can take you home.

588
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:08,021
That's all right.
As great as this date has been,

589
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,921
I don't want to rush anything.

590
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,522
Me neither.

591
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,088
I'll call you.

592
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,863
- Okay.
- Good night.

593
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,984
Ryan:
Please, just shut up!

594
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:43,422
(china breaks)

595
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,321
(china tinkles)

596
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:54,766
Hey! There's the man!

597
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,632
Mary, is everything okay?

598
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,038
Everything's fine.
Was it a good night?

599
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:02,440
It was great, after you guys
stopped shouting at us.

600
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,638
Mary:
Oh, you did hear. Good.

601
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,738
Yeah, they heard in Cucamonga.

602
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,907
What's with this plate?

603
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,316
Oh. Little accident on my part.

604
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:13,320
It's a long story.

605
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:16,152
I will replace that.
Nothing major.

606
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,215
Nothing major.

607
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:21,295
Were you guys fighting?

608
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:25,265
Hah! I told you,
we don't fight.

609
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,062
It's not our thing, buddy.

610
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,063
I think they're clean,
lamb chop.

611
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:33,596
I'll decide that, honeybunches.

612
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,940
Ryan, who were you
just yelling at to shut up?

613
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,709
What? No one. What?

614
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:44,411
So, Scotty, was it a good night?

615
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,750
- Did you tap that ass yet?
- Mary!

616
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:50,724
Aw, come on. Did you give her
the old hot beef injection?

617
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:52,885
- Mary, what the hell?
- Did you make like Sam the Butcher

618
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,395
- and bring Alice the meat?
- Jesus, Mary.

619
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:59,126
Ryan: Mmm. This sex talk have me
heap big in the mood.

620
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,500
Mary: Oh, I love it
when you talk caveman.

621
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:04,402
Ryan: That was, uh,
Indian, dear.

622
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:07,032
Mary:
No, don't be silly. Indian is like,

623
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:09,372
"Oh, curry in a hurry,
Mr. Curry Man."

624
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,503
Native American Indian.

625
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,808
- Oh.
- Oh.

626
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,213
- Mary: Geronimo.
- Mmm.

627
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,414
- Come here.
- Ooh!

628
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:20,716
- Good night.
- Good night.

629
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,655
Mary:
Take me to your wigwam, Chief.

630
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,423
I'm gonna trade you $27
worth of trinkets for that ass.

631
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:29,793
- Hi-ya hi-ya...
- (Mary squeals)

632
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:33,130
- (thumping)
- Mary: Put me on the bearskin rug!

633
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,327
Ryan:
Here's some wampum.

634
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:44,706
(phone rings)

635
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,804
Mary:
I got it!

636
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:56,253
Mary:
Hey, Scotty Dog, phone!

637
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,690
- Hello?
- Hi, Scotty Dog!

638
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,599
Hey, Leslie. Have you been talking
to Mary for the last 20 minutes?

639
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,000
Is that a problem?

640
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,267
No, it's just... they were
acting really weird last night.

641
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:15,434
In fact I'm beginning to think
they're just weird in general.

642
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:17,171
What were
you guys talking about?

643
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,406
Oh, you know, girl stuff.

644
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,381
(door slams)

645
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:24,714
So, what are you doing Friday?
Do you want to hang out?

646
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,811
Yeah, I'd love to.

647
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,719
I hear you like the batting cages.

648
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:32,283
(clinking, crashing)

649
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:35,386
- Where did you hear that?
- I have my sources.

650
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:37,397
- (slamming, banging)
- So, Friday at 7:00?

651
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:41,925
And by the way,
I have now asked you out twice.

652
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:44,028
- (crashing)
I know, and I'm way behind.

653
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:46,596
I have to log at least twice
as many as you

654
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,700
if I'm going to feel
even remotely like a man.

655
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:52,338
Well, get to work, lazybones.
I'll see you Friday, okay?

656
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,314
- Okay.
- Bye.

657
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:55,713
Bye.

658
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,151
(loud crashing)

659
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,087
Jesus, you guys hungry
or something?

660
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,457
Oh, I don't know, Scott.
Maybe we're just being weird.

661
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,359
Yeah, weird
that you would say that,

662
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,762
because I've been
feeling weird lately.

663
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,231
That is so weird!

664
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,255
- That's weird.
- Weird.

665
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,667
Guys, is something going on?

666
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,500
Is this, like, a thing?

667
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:20,735
She heard you tell Lisa
that you think we're weird.

668
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,709
- Leslie.
- Leslie! Fuck!

669
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:24,267
Why do I have such
trouble with that name?

670
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,280
I do too. It's like,
Lisa, Leslie...

671
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,474
But you had no right
to hear that.

672
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:30,973
I was just in the process
of hanging up the phone

673
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:32,349
and making sure you'd
picked up the call,

674
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:36,049
and that it was connecting,
and...

675
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,753
Scott, come on.

676
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:40,954
Do you think we're weird?

677
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,257
(laughs)

678
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,856
Yeah. Yes.

679
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,357
If you want to know the truth, yes,
I think you guys are a little weird.

680
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:49,835
Us?

681
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,428
I'm sure.

682
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:54,134
Scott, I was a Gerber baby.

683
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,838
And I am from Marblehead,
Massachusetts...

684
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,345
- Idyllic!
- Born and raised.

685
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,747
- Yeah.
- Scott, what is so weird about us?

686
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:05,513
Well, okay, for starters,
the whole no-fighting thing.

687
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:06,986
That's... it's just odd.

688
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,956
We're not into
the conflict thing, Scott.

689
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:13,757
I'm just curious. Do you want us
to break up or something?

690
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:15,853
- Right?
- No, I don't want you to break up.

691
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:18,524
But it's just that
normal couples fight,

692
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:22,829
and it's very healthy
for the relationship.

693
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,497
Now I'm just confused.

694
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:27,371
I mean, I don't even know
how to do that.

695
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:31,504
Okay. Just... here, come here.

696
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:34,241
Okay. Mary, you sit here.

697
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:38,741
Ryan, you sit here.

698
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:42,119
No no, guys, get...
trust me here.

699
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:43,783
Sit apart.

700
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,189
There.

701
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:52,560
Now, clearly
there was something

702
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,965
going on last night,

703
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,730
so let's draw from there.

704
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,759
All right?

705
00:35:56,804 --> 00:36:00,035
Now, tell him what you think.

706
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,407
Okay.

707
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,469
Ryan,

708
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:09,141
- you were being a dummy.
- Ryan: Okay, uh,

709
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:12,949
I appreciate that you're speaking
from a place of anger right now.

710
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,455
- Thank you.
- No! Okay, look.

711
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:17,889
Tell her what you were
really thinking last night.

712
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,486
Okay. Uh, I...

713
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:26,330
Mary, I wish that you
would shut your trap, uh,

714
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,894
about the toilet seat.

715
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,996
- Yes, very good.
- Blabbermouth.

716
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,473
Nice. Okay now, Mary,
your rebuttal.

717
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:36,942
Um,

718
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,104
Freak.

719
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:42,407
Twat.

720
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,917
- Ass hat.
- Bitch.

721
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,509
Shitheel.

722
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:46,952
Strumpet.

723
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,477
Jerkoff.

724
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:49,989
Ryan: Queef waffle.

725
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:51,651
Mary: Nagfucker.

726
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:52,989
Tampon wrapper.

727
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,392
Mama's boy.

728
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:56,658
Bloody fucking cun...

729
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:59,461
Ow! Oh!

730
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:06,167
You know, in the UK that word's
not really that big of a deal.

731
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,572
I know.

732
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:11,009
But this is an important lesson
on escalation.

733
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:17,313
You can't go from a slap fight
to a C-bomb.

734
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:20,980
And look. You had a fight
and you're not breaking up.

735
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:23,251
- No.
- No, no.

736
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,918
Scott, you're right.

737
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,054
We have a lot of issues
that we've repressed

738
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:32,554
and you're right,
we need to work on that.

739
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,830
Yeah. Thank you, Scott.

740
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,861
I think it's clear that we both
learned a lot tonight.

741
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:42,065
I can't tell you how much
you mean to us, buddy.

742
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:45,545
Wow. Well, that's really nice.

743
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,740
I'm just so glad we found you.

744
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,077
Aw, come here.

745
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:57,022
Oh.

746
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,625
# Let's go, let's go,
it's on #

747
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:02,924
# Let's go,
let's go along #

748
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:04,225
# Let's go, let's go... #

749
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,893
- What's up, roomie?
- Whoa!

750
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,002
- Hey.
- You okay there, buddy?

751
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,305
Do you want to move on
to free weights, blasts those delts?

752
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:17,810
- Pump your lats?
- Pound your glutes?

753
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:21,007
What do you say?

754
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,017
Uh, no thanks.
I'm done.

755
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,042
- What a coincidence.
- We're done too.

756
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,849
- Ryan: Yeah.
- (Scott laughs)

757
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,549
But you guys just got here.

758
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,615
Hey, we work hard, not long.

759
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,593
- That's how we roll.
- God damn right it is.

760
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:35,219
Where are you headed?

761
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:36,786
Mind if we come with?

762
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,798
No, it won't be necessary.

763
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:42,359
My head's kind of hurting, so I'm gonna
go get some aspirin or something.

764
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,495
Golly.

765
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:46,199
Didn't think it was a crime to want
to spend some time with a friend.

766
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,038
Yeah, I mean if you want
to be alone, be alone.

767
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,737
- We're history.
- Past tense.

768
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,370
- Ghosts.
- Hasta lasagna.

769
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,574
- Peace out...
- Scott: Okay, later.

770
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:56,583
Okay.

771
00:38:56,617 --> 00:38:59,450
Well, what time will
you be home?

772
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:02,478
# Let's go, let's go,
it's on #

773
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:05,720
# Let's go,
let's go along #

774
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:09,217
# Let's go, let's go,
we'll get it on #

775
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,232
# Let's go,
I'm going off #

776
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,463
# Let's go, let's go
right now #

777
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:18,767
# Let's go,
we're going out #

778
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:22,037
# You'll never know
until you go #

779
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:25,239
# Just what
it's all about... #

780
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,679
Damn, you're good.
Our kids would be Hall-of-Famers.

781
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,775
We had three dates.
You've got us having kids?

782
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:34,583
- Just an expression.
- You never know.

783
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:41,694
- You moving?
- I have to.

784
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:44,163
My apartment building
is going condo.

785
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,166
How long do you have
before you have to move?

786
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,031
Mmm, like 40 days.

787
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,735
Leslie...

788
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:55,799
I know this sounds crazy and we
haven't known each other that long,

789
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:58,778
but... move in with me.

790
00:39:58,812 --> 00:40:00,473
What?

791
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:02,243
I'm serious.

792
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:04,979
You can have
your own room and...

793
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:07,317
you know,
it'll be like we're roommates.

794
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:10,983
Oh my God.
(stammers)

795
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:13,585
I mean, what about
Ryan and Mary?

796
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:17,926
To be honest,
it's not really working out.

797
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:21,628
I'll give them plenty of notice
and it'll be fine.

798
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,933
L-I don't know.
I mean, I... I guess

799
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:26,872
I just need to think about it.
This is so out of the blue, Scott.

800
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:29,876
I'm gonna need, like,
some time to...

801
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,935
- I...
- Yeah.

802
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:34,914
I... I think...

803
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:36,939
we should go back
to your place right now.

804
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:38,315
Okay.

805
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,980
'Cause I don't want
to wait another minute.

806
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,955
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

807
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:48,418
Happy birthday to me.

808
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,125
It's just right here.

809
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,066
- Okay, now...
- (giggling)

810
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:56,001
Let me check to make sure
Ryan and Mary aren't here.

811
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,129
Okay, well, hurry up.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

812
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:01,107
(both giggling)

813
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,907
Oh, hey!
Where are you going?

814
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:06,936
I was going to get us
something to drink.

815
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,641
Oh.

816
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:12,243
Well, there is no time
for that.

817
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:14,151
Where is your bedroom?

818
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:18,187
I like where this is heading.

819
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:25,459
Slow down. What are you doing?
Slow down.

820
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,262
Hold on... watch out.

821
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:30,870
Why are you going outside?

822
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:37,636
All:
Surprise!

823
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:40,306
# For he's a jolly good fellow #

824
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:42,713
# For he's a jolly
good fellow #

825
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,278
# For he's a jolly good fellow #

826
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,915
# Which nobody can deny... #

827
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:52,551
- Stop! Okay, that's fine. Stop.
- # Which nobody can deny... #

828
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,084
- Yeah, stop.
- (singing dies down)

829
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:57,962
- Who planned this?
- That would be us.

830
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:01,092
- Chicka chicka boo-ya!
- Hey!

831
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:03,126
Mary:
Happy b-day.

832
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,968
Did you take that picture
while I was sleeping?

833
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:08,736
You just looked
so peaceful.

834
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:13,440
We figured since you don't have any
friends that throw in a rockin' party,

835
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,311
it'd be a great way for you
to make some new ones.

836
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:17,442
- Right?
- All: Yeah!

837
00:42:17,484 --> 00:42:20,453
No no, that's very funny,
but I have lots of friends,

838
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:23,456
- just not in L.A. Right now, okay?
- (all grumbling)

839
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,890
Were you a part of this?

840
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:29,384
This is what Mary and I
were talking about on the phone.

841
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,297
You know, right before
you called us weird.

842
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:35,130
- Mmm, yeah, thanks again for that.
- Yeah.

843
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:37,467
How did you even know
it was my birthday?

844
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:41,235
Well, you left your driver's license
on the counter a couple days ago...

845
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,038
And so you just...
you just picked it up?

846
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:45,567
Dude, she wanted to know
your middle name. What...

847
00:42:45,612 --> 00:42:46,943
- It's Paul.
- Paul.

848
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,504
Everyone, it's Paul.

849
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:51,279
All:
Paul!

850
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,310
Do you two have any awareness of what
personal space and privacy are?

851
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:57,721
Is the idea of keeping your
pesky noses out of my business

852
00:42:57,758 --> 00:43:00,556
so impossible for you
to fathom?

853
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:02,585
Good night, everybody.
Thank you for coming

854
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:05,598
- but there's no party!
- (all groaning)

855
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:08,700
Good night.

856
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:10,931
Scott!

857
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:12,836
Scott?

858
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,898
Scott!

859
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:17,069
How could you do that
to Ryan and Mary?

860
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,772
They went to all this trouble
to throw a party for you and...

861
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:22,008
granted, I guess the people
they invited

862
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:24,984
aren't the coolest people on the planet,
but they seem really nice.

863
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,543
Can't you just be thankful
that you have such good friends?

864
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,647
Leslie,
you don't understand, okay?

865
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,352
There's something very very wrong
about Ryan and Mary.

866
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:33,984
What?
What did they do?

867
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:35,995
Well, they...

868
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:37,792
and...

869
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,865
It's hard to explain, okay?
But... they're freaks, all right?

870
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:47,704
Wow. Okay, well remind me never
to throw you a surprise party.

871
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:50,266
Leslie, wait, sorry.
Please...

872
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,403
I'm sorry.
Could you just wait?

873
00:43:57,618 --> 00:43:59,609
(feedback over microphone)

874
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:03,248
Everyone?

875
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,485
(feedback)

876
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:08,984
I... I am... I'm sorry about all this.

877
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:10,929
Um, I hope you stay.
Please stay.

878
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:14,559
It'd mean a lot to me.
Um, I'll be honest:

879
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,126
I, uh, I...

880
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,638
I don't have any friends
right now in L.A.

881
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:23,666
So I didn't tell the few people
that I do know about my birthday

882
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,544
because I was afraid that I would
look like a complete loser...

883
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,515
um...

884
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,916
if I didn't have anybody
to celebrate with.

885
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:35,552
I, um,
I'm glad you're all here

886
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,114
and I hope you'll stay

887
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:40,149
and forgive me for
lashing out at you.

888
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,725
And let's have some fun.

889
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,667
DJ, drop it like it's hot.

890
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:51,464
(record screeches,
heavy metal song begins)

891
00:44:51,505 --> 00:44:54,906
# Die now, die #

892
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,309
- # Die now, die #
- (all singing along)

893
00:44:58,345 --> 00:45:01,872
# Die now, die! #

894
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:05,783
# Die now, die... #

895
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:16,094
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

896
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:17,721
You're not gonna leave, are you?

897
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:21,996
I'll bet the DJ can play
some Norwegian black metal,

898
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:24,094
maybe some Limp Bizkit.

899
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,799
Uh, Limp Bizkit is
a deal breaker.

900
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,637
# I can't wait #

901
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:39,849
(pop song playing)

902
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,758
(giggles)

903
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,372
# My love #

904
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:05,537
# Tell me what it's all about #

905
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:09,511
(Ryan whirring)

906
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,017
Sporty Spice.

907
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:14,520
- Oh!
- Look at that... cute.

908
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:19,248
Holy shit, he really does live
with them. I thought you were kidding.

909
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:20,850
Honey, you promised, remember?

910
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:23,328
- I need to talk to you.
- Hi, I'm...

911
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,092
Hi.

912
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:29,091
Woman:
Aww!

913
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:31,570
- Thank you, thank you.
- Mwah!

914
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:36,042
Hey, Ted, you have history
with Ryan and Mary.

915
00:46:36,076 --> 00:46:38,601
Can I talk to you
about them?

916
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:41,808
You're going to want something
much stronger than beer.

917
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,118
Okay, I'm not even going to tell you
what I had to promise Ted

918
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:48,451
to get him here.

919
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:51,218
You know, it's not that
I mind doing it, but...

920
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,522
I'm not gonna tell you.

921
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,357
The joys of
a long-term relationship.

922
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,953
Girl, you have no idea.

923
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,692
No, I don't.

924
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,791
Oh, speaking of which,
what's going on with that one?

925
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:05,635
Yeah, that's the thing.
Um, Scott asked me to move in with him.

926
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:08,140
Jeez, he doesn't waste
any time.

927
00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:11,272
Wait a minute...
what did you say?

928
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:14,405
Well, I'm kinda leaning
toward yes.

929
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:17,814
Not again.
Are you serious?

930
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,513
- It's different this time.
- How? How is it different?

931
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:23,580
Because I'm going to wait to
commit to a decision...

932
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:24,749
Good... wait.

933
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:28,124
- Until after we go
to your wedding together.

934
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:32,063
A week? You're going to wait one week?
That's the difference?

935
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,091
A week is long...

936
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:36,295
- ish.

937
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:38,827
Oh my God.
Have you even...

938
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:41,067
- No. I know.
- So you're going to live here and...

939
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,804
- No, it's his birthday tonight.
- Okay.

940
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:46,870
And so I'm thinking, you know,
if he plays his cards right,

941
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:49,882
- like...
- Oh my God.

942
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,407
- Oh my God!
- (Leslie giggling)

943
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,285
Okay, well, then
we're going to need this.

944
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:56,311
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

945
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:58,324
- Let's open that.
- Let's open it

946
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:00,622
'cause we're both
gonna be busy.

947
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,003
Damn near killed her!

948
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,065
- We need to talk.
- You get the olives?

949
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:18,669
How can you think about olives
at a time like this?

950
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:21,545
Well, what am I supposed to put
in my martini, love? A pork chop?

951
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:24,243
Just shut up and come
with me to the bathroom!

952
00:48:24,284 --> 00:48:25,945
- (record screeches to halt)
- Okay.

953
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,318
Have a cocktail.

954
00:48:28,355 --> 00:48:31,085
See? They even go
to the friggin' can together.

955
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:33,422
Let me ask you one thing:
Have you ever once seen them apart?

956
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,826
No, I guess not.
Not really.

957
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:38,990
No, of course not, because they,
my friend, are a couple monster.

958
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:41,466
- A couple monster?
- They go to lunch together;

959
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,366
they go to the gym together;
they go to bars together;

960
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:47,066
they commute together.
I heard they share a cubicle at work...

961
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:50,975
not an office; a cubicle.
That's not right.

962
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:53,673
And the sick part
about it is,

963
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:55,442
because they spend
all of their time together,

964
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:57,882
they have absolutely nothing
left to talk about...

965
00:48:57,918 --> 00:49:01,149
nothing to keep them from
going lighthouse crazy.

966
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,816
- That's why they latch.
- Latch?

967
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,054
Back when I knew them, they spent
all of their time with this girl,

968
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:09,687
um, Amy. Amy was like
the buffer between them.

969
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:10,923
She was their third wheel.

970
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:13,091
She was the one they
could talk about their day with.

971
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,760
She was the one
that they could deflect

972
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:17,031
all their weird fuck tension onto
instead of each other.

973
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,799
- So what happened to Amy?
- Don't know.

974
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:21,239
She got wise, got out. Maybe they
cooked and ate her. Who knows?

975
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:25,040
But the important thing is, dude,
you are the new Amy.

976
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,206
And from what
you've told me

977
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:30,239
about them trying to screw up
your dates with Leslie...

978
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:33,377
I didn't say that they were trying.
They just... they nearly did.

979
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,785
Think about it:

980
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,016
If you end up with Leslie,
they are out of the picture.

981
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,685
They are clearly not
going to let that happen.

982
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,250
And let me tell you
one more thing:

983
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:42,989
If I wanted to make you
look like a loser

984
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:44,758
in front of a potential girlfriend,

985
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:48,325
this is pretty much exactly
the party I would throw for you.

986
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:54,773
Happy birthday, Amy.

987
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:00,276
(man shouting in Japanese)

988
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,379
Scott: And that's when
I realized they were trying

989
00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:08,819
to sabotage my relationship
with Leslie.

990
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,345
I don't know, man.

991
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,950
Sounds like they were just maybe
trying to keep you from rushing it,

992
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:14,654
like they said they would do.

993
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:17,891
You're listening to Ted?
Leslie told you he was a cynic.

994
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,331
Plus you planned
to kick 'em out.

995
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,062
That's a pretty douchey move.

996
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,730
Hey, whose side are
you guys on anyway?

997
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,238
Right now?

998
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,242
Don't answer that until
you hear the rest.

999
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:33,042
Well, thanks again for
helping with the table.

1000
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:35,274
Have fun, you two.
Drive safe.

1001
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:37,374
Yeah, get home
carefully now.

1002
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,725
(soft music playing)

1003
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,026
Well, that was some party.

1004
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:52,429
Mmm.

1005
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,299
(door opens)

1006
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:58,133
Well, gosh,
that was fun, huh?

1007
00:50:58,171 --> 00:50:59,695
Wasn't that fun?

1008
00:50:59,739 --> 00:51:03,106
Tables are inside;
guests have all left. It's all good.

1009
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,169
Say, Leslie, do you need
a ride somewhere, honey?

1010
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:08,510
It doesn't matter how far it is.
We'd be happy to take you.

1011
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:10,743
Oh, I think I'm gonna
stay for a little bit.

1012
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:12,775
Wonderful!

1013
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,585
You know, we need to make sure
that we do this all the time,

1014
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:18,955
the four of us just hosting
these little shindigs.

1015
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,516
- Mm-hmm.
- The four of us?

1016
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,620
Mary: Oh, we heard the big news and
we could not be happier.

1017
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,996
I mean, this place is plenty
big enough for four.

1018
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,058
- When you moving in, Lisa?
- Leslie.

1019
00:51:29,102 --> 00:51:31,468
- God damn it.
- It's okay, honey.

1020
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:33,802
Hold on, guys. There's some stuff
we need to discuss first.

1021
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,308
- What stuff?
- Yeah, what kind of stuff?

1022
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,039
Mary: I mean, I'm assuming
she'll live in your room,

1023
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,105
go in a fourth on rent and utilities,
buy TP when it's her turn.

1024
00:51:42,148 --> 00:51:44,844
And besides that, what is there
really to discuss?

1025
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:47,284
Look, this is not how
I wanted this to come up.

1026
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,309
Mmm, why not?

1027
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,220
How did you want it
to come up, Scottsdale?

1028
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:52,281
Were you gonna
shoot us an email?

1029
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:56,056
Or maybe you were
gonna blog it on... your blog?

1030
00:51:57,063 --> 00:51:58,792
Can we just talk about this
another time?

1031
00:51:58,832 --> 00:52:00,823
Scotty Dog, you seem
a little tense.

1032
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,300
Are you sure you're okay?

1033
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:05,827
Darling, I think maybe we should discuss
this under the light of a new day.

1034
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,965
You know, honey,
you're right.

1035
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:09,669
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1036
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,405
- Let's go.
- Good night, roommates.

1037
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,379
(silent)

1038
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,683
I'm so sorry that happened.

1039
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,990
No, I'm sorry.
I said something to Nerissa

1040
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,724
and she must have said
something to Mary

1041
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:32,698
without realizing it was...

1042
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,633
whatever it was.

1043
00:52:35,668 --> 00:52:37,693
I'll talk to them
tomorrow morning.

1044
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:42,804
Mary:
Oh, that's it, Farmer Jack.

1045
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:45,333
Oh, shit.
Just wait.

1046
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,073
- Oh!
- Ryan: We'll miss the fall!

1047
00:52:47,113 --> 00:52:48,444
(both moan)

1048
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:49,470
- Mmm!
- Ahh!

1049
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:52,383
- Ryan? Hey hey, Ryan!
- Ahhh!

1050
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,047
Mary, listen to me.
Okay, tonight,

1051
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,023
I beg you, while Leslie's here,
could you please not...

1052
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:00,083
- Please...
- Please don't.

1053
00:53:00,126 --> 00:53:02,924
- Sounds like... how many syllables?
- Is it bigger than a breadbox?

1054
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:04,691
Please don't have sex
while Leslie is here.

1055
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:06,426
- What?
- Why not?

1056
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:09,993
Because the sound...
the noise that you two make,

1057
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:11,628
it's... it's insane,

1058
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:14,469
both in the volume
and the graphicness.

1059
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:16,236
Scott,

1060
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,837
have you been listening to us
have sex?

1061
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:23,111
Shh! No, I haven't been listening.
I can just hear it.

1062
00:53:23,149 --> 00:53:25,777
How many times, Scott?

1063
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:27,684
Every.

1064
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,780
All right? I turn my music up,
but I can still hear it.

1065
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:32,758
This is creepy.
If we had known

1066
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:36,228
that you were eavesdropping
on our sex...

1067
00:53:36,262 --> 00:53:39,425
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to break me and Lisa up...

1068
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,831
- Leslie!
- Hard name.

1069
00:53:40,867 --> 00:53:42,095
- It is.
- It is, yeah.

1070
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:45,104
We are not trying to
break you up, Scotty.

1071
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,971
We are just trying to
slow you down.

1072
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:49,474
Like we said we would, pal.

1073
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:51,568
No rushing, remember? Huh?

1074
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:54,079
- That deal is off.
- God damn it, Scott!

1075
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:56,105
No one wants to see it
work out between you and Leslie

1076
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:59,414
more than Ryan and I, but you are
screwing everything up.

1077
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:00,749
What... what am I screwing up?

1078
00:54:00,787 --> 00:54:03,312
You asked her to move in with you
after two dates.

1079
00:54:03,356 --> 00:54:04,983
- Two!
- Come on, man.

1080
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:07,151
Couldn't scare her away any faster
if you told her you were

1081
00:54:07,193 --> 00:54:10,924
a Nazi sympathizer who's into
fondling puppy balls!

1082
00:54:10,964 --> 00:54:14,161
- Or a chronic masturbator.
- You know, with a Scott fetish.

1083
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,997
- Mary: Into she-males!
- Furries!

1084
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,832
- Bukaki.
- Tentacle porn.

1085
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:19,771
Ahhh!

1086
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,541
Ooh!

1087
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:28,046
(strained)
It was for your own good.

1088
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:30,572
This is for my own good.

1089
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:32,380
Ahhh!

1090
00:54:34,554 --> 00:54:37,648
- I got you. Just get...
- Eat less cake, bitch!

1091
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:40,919
How dare you, sir?

1092
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:45,660
- Oh, I got you.
- Scott: No no!

1093
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:47,393
Don't let him go!

1094
00:54:47,433 --> 00:54:49,492
Ahh!
I got him!

1095
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:53,336
- Scott!
- Ahh! Bad!

1096
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,739
- Oh, shit.
- Ha ha!

1097
00:54:55,775 --> 00:54:59,176
Oh, God,
this was fun.

1098
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,680
Ryan:
Oh, it is never a dull moment here.

1099
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:03,375
- Let me tell you.
- I'll admit

1100
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,407
that this probably looks
kinda bad...

1101
00:55:05,451 --> 00:55:07,351
Yeah, but you know,
just playing.

1102
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,911
- Tomfoolery.
- Shenanigans.

1103
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:11,116
- Rough-housing.
- Little, uh...

1104
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:13,819
no big biggie.
You know, you want some cake?

1105
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,090
No, thanks.

1106
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,854
I'm gonna go.

1107
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,866
It was great
to see you, Leslie.

1108
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,460
- See you soon, roomie.
- Can I drive you home?

1109
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:24,731
That's okay.

1110
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:27,638
I know this looks insane,
but it's like they said, you know?

1111
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:31,337
- Just playing around.
- Mmm! Ahhh!

1112
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:33,208
- Mary: You're delicious.
- No, you're delicious.

1113
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,407
We're still on for
the wedding next week, right?

1114
00:55:35,448 --> 00:55:38,542
- Ryan: You're like a cupcake!
- I don't know.

1115
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,544
Listen, Leslie, this is not me.
Okay? None of this is.

1116
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,922
Just please give me one more chance
without anybody else around,

1117
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:47,688
- just me.
- We're still on for the wedding.

1118
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:49,285
I'll see you at the wedding.

1119
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,820
- (door slams)
- You want to hang out before?

1120
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:55,163
Let's just stick with the wedding.
I mean, you've got this thing

1121
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:57,465
going on with your roommates that
you need to work out.

1122
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:59,562
I know, I will. Promise.

1123
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,437
- Okay.
- Okay.

1124
00:56:01,474 --> 00:56:02,839
Bye.

1125
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:06,136
- (bed squeaking)
- Mary: Come on! Yeah!

1126
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:08,079
(both grunting, screaming)

1127
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,810
- Harder!
- Get there, get there, get there!

1128
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,784
- Oh! Hi!
- Hey!

1129
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:15,617
Great party, isn't it?
Huh? Ha ha!

1130
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:17,179
You two are sick.

1131
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:19,885
I want you out of this apartment.
I want you out of my life!

1132
00:56:19,926 --> 00:56:21,553
- Really?
- Mary: We love you!

1133
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:23,752
(computer beeps)

1134
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:30,367
Scott: I didn't see them at all
that last week.

1135
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:33,429
I assumed they'd just
gone away for good.

1136
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,964
Well, did they?

1137
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:38,341
- Does herpes?
- (chuckles)

1138
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,811
- No.
- (bells dinging)

1139
00:56:56,129 --> 00:57:00,065
(organ playing
"The Wedding March")

1140
00:57:15,048 --> 00:57:18,040
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- (all gasp)

1141
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:21,152
Man:
Who invited that guy?

1142
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,052
Man #2:
Who says "fuck" in church?

1143
00:57:26,759 --> 00:57:29,159
Ted:
It's fine. Try not to worry about it.

1144
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,856
Okay.

1145
00:57:30,897 --> 00:57:32,057
- Yeah, go.
- I'm...

1146
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:34,089
- Okay. Sorry.
- It's fine.

1147
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:35,191
It's fine, right?

1148
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:39,261
Well, that was
a beautiful service. Ha ha.

1149
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:42,240
Aside from your little outburst,
yeah, it was lovely.

1150
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:43,742
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1151
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:47,371
I just couldn't believe they had
the gall to show up here.

1152
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:49,779
- Who?
- Ryan and Mary.

1153
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:54,014
I did the guest list with Nerissa.
Ryan and Mary weren't invited.

1154
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,022
Yeah, like that would stop them.
Where the hell did they go anyway?

1155
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,717
- Who?
- Ryan and Mary.

1156
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:01,420
Okay, I have to
do photographs.

1157
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:05,488
Just stay here and try to be...

1158
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:07,590
sane-ish.

1159
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:19,839
(dialing, beeping)

1160
00:58:19,879 --> 00:58:23,838
(pop song plays
over phone)

1161
00:58:23,883 --> 00:58:26,511
# I can't wait... #

1162
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,512
Aha!
What are you two doing here?

1163
00:58:31,557 --> 00:58:34,321
Making out.
What does it look like we're doing?

1164
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,225
Weddings make me
so horny.

1165
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,026
Of course! Everything makes you horny.
Toaster ovens make you horny.

1166
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:40,293
You were not invited.

1167
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:44,497
That is never gonna stop us from
helping out our good buddy.

1168
00:58:44,537 --> 00:58:47,563
Friendship does not wait for
an invitation, mister.

1169
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,303
And besides,
we have a contract.

1170
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,612
(Scott grunting)

1171
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:58,116
This contract...

1172
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,444
is null and void,
same as our friendship.

1173
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:04,752
- Unappreciative asshole!
- Yeah.

1174
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,949
Scott, what are you doing?

1175
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:35,509
Leslie, I didn't bring this gift
but it has my name on it.

1176
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:39,218
Why would that be?

1177
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:41,192
You see, Ryan and Mary

1178
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:43,457
placed this gift
with my name on it

1179
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,293
to set me up to
make me look bad.

1180
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,128
How does the gift
make you look bad?

1181
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,396
See, it's not a gift.

1182
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:52,404
It's a trap. It's probably a box
of tainted pork

1183
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:55,532
or dogshit or angry bees.

1184
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:58,066
- I have to get rid of it.
- Are you completely insane?

1185
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,873
- No, I...
- Young man,

1186
00:59:59,912 --> 01:00:02,312
any reason you're absconding
with the gift I brought?

1187
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:05,146
I... I'm sorry, but this
isn't your gift.

1188
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,617
I assure you, it is.

1189
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:10,713
- Scott?
- Now look, you bizarre human being...

1190
01:00:10,756 --> 01:00:13,122
- Okay, Scott, you're making a scene.
- This package contains

1191
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:16,253
- a ridiculously expensive...
- Just give him the gift.

1192
01:00:16,295 --> 01:00:19,059
- Give him the gift. Give him the gift!
- It's Leslie Green's date.

1193
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:21,066
- I remember placing it on that table...
- Why's he picking on Dr. Cooper?

1194
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,863
- An hour ago!
If you don't believe me,

1195
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:25,336
make a complete ass of yourself
and open it!

1196
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,703
Oh, we're way beyond
the complete-ass situation.

1197
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,503
(both struggling)

1198
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,511
- Leslie!
- Oh!

1199
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,810
(all screaming)

1200
01:00:35,848 --> 01:00:37,372
Oh my God.

1201
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:39,384
What the fuck?

1202
01:00:39,418 --> 01:00:41,852
- Ohhh!
- (giggling)

1203
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,379
Leslie, come on.
Look, this isn't me, okay?

1204
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:47,153
- The... I'm not usually like this.
- What are you usually like?

1205
01:00:47,193 --> 01:00:49,718
Normal, I swear.

1206
01:00:49,762 --> 01:00:52,162
This is Ryan and Mary, okay?

1207
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:55,133
- They're trying to keep us apart.
- Why would they want to do that?

1208
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,465
Because they need me.

1209
01:00:57,503 --> 01:00:59,368
They need a third wheel
to keep sane.

1210
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,168
That's why they keep trying
to scare you off,

1211
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:03,038
so they can have me
all to themselves.

1212
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:06,101
And how did you come up
with this incredible theory?

1213
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:08,511
Actually, Ted said it.

1214
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:11,449
You're going to take anything
Ted says seriously?

1215
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:14,214
But it makes sense.
They say they're trying to keep me

1216
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,118
from rushing into
anything with you, but...

1217
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:18,350
But we were rushing.

1218
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:21,417
I mean, the fact that we were even
considering moving in together

1219
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,860
after a couple of nice dates...
that's rushing.

1220
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:26,160
I mean, I was willing
to consider it

1221
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:28,325
- because I...
- "Was"?

1222
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:31,200
Why are you speaking in
the past tense like that?

1223
01:01:31,237 --> 01:01:33,535
Because I don't know you, Scott.

1224
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:35,564
I don't know you at all.

1225
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,441
- But it's Ryan and Mary...
- Scott.

1226
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:42,474
(sighs)

1227
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:02,124
(sniffing)

1228
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:05,662
Leslie won't return
my phone calls.

1229
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:09,004
I haven't been back
to the apartment.

1230
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:12,499
They're probably up there
waiting to strike again.

1231
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:15,946
- Jackals!
- Well, they did kind of have a point.

1232
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,610
- What point?
- About the rushing it with Lisa.

1233
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,620
- Leslie!
- Ooh, sorry.

1234
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,350
Maybe they really thought
they were doing the right thing.

1235
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,950
I mean, sure, they're a little strange,
but you know,

1236
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,018
their hearts were
in the right place.

1237
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:31,359
Have you heard a word
that I have said?

1238
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,592
Have you?

1239
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:37,001
"Have you"!

1240
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,807
(grumbles)

1241
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,816
(clattering)

1242
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,617
Oh!

1243
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:59,124
(clattering continues)

1244
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,328
Oh, golly, did we wake you?

1245
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,195
Yeah, what lousy friends
we must be.

1246
01:03:06,232 --> 01:03:09,258
Of course, you know all about
being a lousy friend, huh, Scott?

1247
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:10,791
Me?

1248
01:03:10,836 --> 01:03:13,566
After everything we've been through...
the good times

1249
01:03:13,606 --> 01:03:16,040
We helped you rebound, man.

1250
01:03:16,075 --> 01:03:19,875
We were just trying to help you like
we promised you we would

1251
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:22,278
and you treated us

1252
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:26,045
like... like we are a couple of raging
lunatics or something.

1253
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:30,312
I'm sorry.

1254
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:35,389
Just put your keys
on the counter.

1255
01:03:42,435 --> 01:03:43,925
Both of them.

1256
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:46,665
We only had the one.

1257
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:48,435
Of course.

1258
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:52,171
Why would you need two?
You probably share a toothbrush.

1259
01:03:54,647 --> 01:03:57,912
You'll be happy to know we'll
be packed out by tonight.

1260
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,680
- Super.
- You'll never hear from us again.

1261
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:13,422
"We will not..."

1262
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:15,457
I want you to sign this contract.

1263
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:17,492
You said that I will not
hear from you again.

1264
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:19,902
I want to make it official.

1265
01:04:25,544 --> 01:04:27,603
There, prick.

1266
01:04:27,646 --> 01:04:29,614
Thanks, bitch.

1267
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:35,676
- Choke on it, ass.
- Shhh!

1268
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:38,622
- We have a contract.
- (gasps)

1269
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:41,421
Ryan?

1270
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,020
It is a tragedy
that we can't talk to Scott

1271
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:46,998
'cause we can't tell him
where Leslie's going.

1272
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:49,398
That is a shame.
I heard that she's leaving L.A.

1273
01:04:49,435 --> 01:04:52,233
- I heard the same thing.
- What?

1274
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:53,932
Oh!

1275
01:04:55,207 --> 01:04:57,903
No no, there's something that
you two know and you're not telling me.

1276
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:02,243
Fine!

1277
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:06,351
Now tell me.

1278
01:05:07,419 --> 01:05:10,286
We overheard Leslie
talking to some friends at the wedding

1279
01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:12,517
- after you left.
- You stayed after I left?

1280
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:15,026
- Duh.
- Open bar, dude.

1281
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,322
Come on.

1282
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:19,092
She said she needed to
get out of L.A.

1283
01:05:19,131 --> 01:05:20,826
And she decided...

1284
01:05:23,202 --> 01:05:25,295
to go work with her sister.

1285
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:27,737
- Where?
- If we tell you,

1286
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:30,071
you have to promise
to forgive us, huh?

1287
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:32,304
Fine, I forgive you.
You're forgiven.

1288
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:35,074
- Now tell me.
- Not so fast.

1289
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,246
I got it.
By signing here,

1290
01:05:44,323 --> 01:05:48,487
you acknowledge that we have acted
entirely in your best interest.

1291
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,757
Fine. Fine.
I'm willing to buy that for now.

1292
01:05:50,796 --> 01:05:54,459
And that we really do care
about you as a friend.

1293
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,933
Okay, yes. Whatever.

1294
01:05:55,968 --> 01:06:00,064
And if you go after Leslie,
we get to come with you.

1295
01:06:00,105 --> 01:06:02,005
No no no!
No way. Nah!

1296
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,807
Dude, your piece-of-shit car
will never make it. You need us.

1297
01:06:05,845 --> 01:06:09,645
And company.
No one likes to travel alone.

1298
01:06:09,682 --> 01:06:11,980
- Huh?
- I can rent a car.

1299
01:06:12,017 --> 01:06:16,147
And trust me, traveling alone
really beats the alternative.

1300
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:17,985
Hmm.

1301
01:06:18,023 --> 01:06:20,651
Suit yourself.

1302
01:06:20,693 --> 01:06:23,161
It just would have been such
a great opportunity

1303
01:06:23,195 --> 01:06:25,425
for Ryan and me
to explain to Leslie

1304
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:28,627
that we caused all of this
and not you,

1305
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,965
but, hey, we don't...

1306
01:06:31,003 --> 01:06:32,766
Seriously?

1307
01:06:32,805 --> 01:06:35,433
- Yeah.
- We want out of this friendship.

1308
01:06:35,474 --> 01:06:38,375
That means no loose ends;
no unfinished business.

1309
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,379
- We seek closure, nothing more.
- Nothing more.

1310
01:06:41,413 --> 01:06:43,040
Huh?

1311
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,277
Okay, we'll go together.

1312
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:47,615
Just whatever...
whatever it takes.

1313
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:49,644
Just tell me where she is.

1314
01:06:49,688 --> 01:06:53,749
Okay, I'm gonna need you to sign here
and initial here and here and here.

1315
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,817
That one too.

1316
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:57,055
- Good eye.
- Thank you.

1317
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,428
You guys are sick.

1318
01:06:59,465 --> 01:07:02,161
Okay. Now...

1319
01:07:02,201 --> 01:07:04,066
tell me where she is.

1320
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:07,368
She went to work for
her sister's theater in Oregon.

1321
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:09,237
Okay, where in Oregon?

1322
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,539
You're gonna find out
when we get there.

1323
01:07:11,577 --> 01:07:13,875
- Wiki-wiki road trip!
- Yeah!

1324
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:15,380
Both:
Blau!

1325
01:07:16,582 --> 01:07:18,607
Mary and Ryan:
#The love we have #

1326
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:22,849
# Will never fade away #

1327
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:27,924
# If ever two hearts were
meant to be #

1328
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,860
# Forever in love #

1329
01:07:29,895 --> 01:07:32,261
# It's you and me #

1330
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,232
# Every Ionely heart #

1331
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:36,564
# Every Ionely moment #

1332
01:07:36,602 --> 01:07:38,900
# Feels like eternity #

1333
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:40,667
# Ah oooh #

1334
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:41,866
- # The life we... #
- Oh oh oh.

1335
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:44,671
- You're tailgating.
- I'm not, sweetheart.

1336
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,541
Please back up, dear.

1337
01:07:46,578 --> 01:07:48,876
Damn it, woman,
I know what I'm doing, shrew.

1338
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:50,814
- Assrod.
- Harpie.

1339
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:53,113
- Nancy boy.
- Slut.

1340
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,312
- Fartknocker.
- Whore!

1341
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:55,581
Fuckstick!

1342
01:07:55,621 --> 01:07:58,089
I fucking love
this fighting shit.

1343
01:07:58,123 --> 01:08:00,182
- I do too. It's amazing!
- Ahh!

1344
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:03,023
Scott, what's the plan
with Leslie?

1345
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,963
I don't really have a plan;
I'm just gonna play it by ear.

1346
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,523
Mary: Scotty, you gotta
have a game plan.

1347
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:11,730
We made a plan a long time ago;
we've stuck to it.

1348
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,965
How do you think we've been
together all these years, huh?

1349
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,997
Just because you've done
something for a long time

1350
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,440
doesn't mean you're doing it well.

1351
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:20,274
Yeah, look at the Clippers.
Hi-yo! Ha ha!

1352
01:08:20,312 --> 01:08:22,837
- Burn, right?
- Watch it, laughing boy.

1353
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,872
I was talking about the Clippers.
I wasn't talking about us. Jesus Christ.

1354
01:08:24,917 --> 01:08:28,318
Ryan, pull off here.
Let's stay for the night.

1355
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,049
Dude, we're, like,
not even halfway there.

1356
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:32,785
If we stop now, it's gonna take us
two days to get there.

1357
01:08:32,825 --> 01:08:34,486
I know.

1358
01:08:34,526 --> 01:08:36,221
I've got a plan.

1359
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:38,593
Ho ho, you've got
a plan now. Okay.

1360
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,257
- All right, Mr. Plan.
- Okay.

1361
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:44,795
(knocking)

1362
01:08:44,837 --> 01:08:47,533
- Ryan: Room service.
- Land shark!

1363
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:49,666
(strumming)

1364
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,316
Ow! We were thinking

1365
01:09:04,356 --> 01:09:06,085
since we're on vacation,

1366
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:08,719
maybe we should get
a little drinky-poo!

1367
01:09:08,761 --> 01:09:11,594
I'll go, but only with Ryan.

1368
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,393
- What?
- Huh?

1369
01:09:13,432 --> 01:09:15,923
I want to go out for a beer,
but just us guys.

1370
01:09:15,968 --> 01:09:18,903
Well, do I smell funny
or something?

1371
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:22,202
Tonight I'll go out with Ryan;
tomorrow I'll go out with Mary...

1372
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:24,602
alone.

1373
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:26,110
Why?

1374
01:09:26,145 --> 01:09:28,545
Because couples do things
separately.

1375
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,174
Well, did you ever think

1376
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:34,117
that maybe we just enjoy each other's
company more than most couples?

1377
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:36,986
Most couples spend a good
percentage of any relationship

1378
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:39,047
sick of each other's face.

1379
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,922
That's just part of
being in love.

1380
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,688
Ha! Ha, hmm.

1381
01:09:42,728 --> 01:09:46,687
That is not a part
that I'm interested in...

1382
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:49,633
but I do want that drink.

1383
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:51,659
- (door opens)
- You...

1384
01:09:51,703 --> 01:09:54,638
- (door closes)
- (banjo strumming)

1385
01:09:57,309 --> 01:09:59,539
Well, what do I do?

1386
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:02,741
# I got a stripper pole
in my bedroom #

1387
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,477
# And I like the way
you drop it low #

1388
01:10:05,517 --> 01:10:08,077
# What you tryin' to do,
shorty? #

1389
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,783
# Oh, I can tell that
you're down for whatever #

1390
01:10:11,824 --> 01:10:14,054
# If you think that
you can handle me #

1391
01:10:14,093 --> 01:10:15,185
# I'm trying... #

1392
01:10:15,227 --> 01:10:17,286
I never really took you
for a stripper type.

1393
01:10:17,329 --> 01:10:20,059
Oh, no, I've never been
to a strip club before.

1394
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:26,799
Oh, 11.

1395
01:10:26,839 --> 01:10:28,431
11 what?

1396
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:32,240
11 breasts I've seen.

1397
01:10:32,277 --> 01:10:33,904
You've only seen
11 breasts?

1398
01:10:33,946 --> 01:10:37,279
I mean, you know, in real life.
I've seen more on, you know, TV

1399
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,149
and magazines.
Internet... ho!

1400
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:42,653
Oh... 13.

1401
01:10:42,688 --> 01:10:45,851
- Two.
- Why is this an odd number?

1402
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,291
I saw one of my grandma's
when I was a kid.

1403
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,794
I wish I hadn't asked.

1404
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:52,922
Nana; Mary, naturally;

1405
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:55,832
uh, Wendy Harper; Tracy Price;

1406
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:58,860
Theresa What's-her-name;
and, uh...

1407
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:01,304
and these strippers, yeah.

1408
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,365
14!
Even number! Boom.

1409
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:05,933
And these other girls were, what?
Exes?

1410
01:11:05,978 --> 01:11:08,139
No. No, Mary's the only girl
I've ever dated.

1411
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,273
Uh, they were girls Mary and I
had three-ways with.

1412
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:12,909
- You've had three three-ways?
- Seven.

1413
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:16,216
Seven?
The other four were with...

1414
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:18,280
I should have known.

1415
01:11:18,323 --> 01:11:20,052
Oh, thank God you're here!

1416
01:11:20,092 --> 01:11:23,357
Oh, I see you're already out looking
for a better offer, you motherfucker!

1417
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:25,920
- Mary, come on.
- Son of a bitch! Asshole!

1418
01:11:25,964 --> 01:11:27,989
Look, Ryan's not scamming.

1419
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,831
And trust me, this is not the kind of
place one goes to for a better offer.

1420
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,734
(grunts)

1421
01:11:32,771 --> 01:11:34,898
I turn my back for one second

1422
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,602
and you are out philandering
with strippers?

1423
01:11:37,643 --> 01:11:40,874
- I am not a prude, Ryan.
- Yeah, no shit.

1424
01:11:40,913 --> 01:11:43,643
Excuse me, Scott, but this...

1425
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:46,674
this is beyond
the pale, okay?

1426
01:11:46,718 --> 01:11:49,016
Simply beyond the pale!

1427
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:51,386
Mary, look, okay?
I don't know how you got here,

1428
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:54,517
but you have to leave. You have to
show Ryan that you trust him.

1429
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,585
Well, how can I trust him

1430
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,721
- when he's sporting a chubby?
- Okay.

1431
01:11:58,764 --> 01:12:00,561
Mary, come on!

1432
01:12:00,599 --> 01:12:02,191
Come on what?

1433
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,998
You want me to act like it's no big deal
that my man's at half-mast?

1434
01:12:05,037 --> 01:12:07,597
- It is a big deal.
- We're just having some guy time.

1435
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:10,005
All right?
He'll keep it in his pants.

1436
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,805
(high-pitched)
Uh-huh.

1437
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:14,334
- I promise.
- And if it's any consolation,

1438
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:18,008
as you can see, I am
completely flaccid now.

1439
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:20,917
We all are, Ryan.
We all are.

1440
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:32,554
Don't wait up for us, Ryan.

1441
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,692
I was...
I couldn't find the...

1442
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:37,929
I was just trying to...

1443
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:43,434
If you guys see
my gym-membership card,

1444
01:12:43,475 --> 01:12:45,875
just...

1445
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:47,640
give that to me.

1446
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:49,544
Okay.

1447
01:12:49,581 --> 01:12:51,276
I'm gonna go.

1448
01:12:52,718 --> 01:12:55,653
Okay, have fun.

1449
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:59,521
# Let's fall in love #

1450
01:13:00,692 --> 01:13:03,217
# Let's fall in love #

1451
01:13:04,696 --> 01:13:07,631
# Everything I see around #

1452
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,566
# Reminds me of... #

1453
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:11,796
My God, this place is
like an advertisement

1454
01:13:11,837 --> 01:13:13,395
for choosing a partner
at a young age.

1455
01:13:13,438 --> 01:13:15,167
I am getting hepatitis
just being in here.

1456
01:13:15,207 --> 01:13:17,300
That's the spirit.

1457
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:21,676
Look, I want you to have a conversation
with one of these fine gentlemen.

1458
01:13:21,713 --> 01:13:24,079
- Why?
- Because

1459
01:13:24,116 --> 01:13:26,676
I want to see how you talk
to a man that isn't Ryan.

1460
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:29,778
Scott, this is silly.
Can we just go home? I can't...

1461
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:32,483
Hey, there, pretty lady.

1462
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,253
Can I buy you a drink?

1463
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:36,158
Scott?

1464
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,658
(silent)

1465
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,261
Could you just give us
a moment, please?

1466
01:13:44,303 --> 01:13:45,292
Sure.

1467
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:48,500
You have to get rid of him!
He is trying to get in my pants.

1468
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,167
So? He's not going to.

1469
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,971
It's not like you're tempted to
sleep with him or anything.

1470
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,205
I'm tempted to
fuck his brains out.

1471
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:55,679
(moans)

1472
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:57,375
I'd fuck him;
I'd fuck that guy;

1473
01:13:57,416 --> 01:13:59,145
I'd fuck the guy air-guitaring
back there.

1474
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:01,084
I'd fuck everybody I could
see right now

1475
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:03,952
because I just want the chance
to be with somebody else!

1476
01:14:03,989 --> 01:14:06,219
This is the reason I cannot be
trusted without Ryan around me

1477
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:07,816
at all times.

1478
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:11,386
Just once I want to be with another guy
without Ryan in the room.

1479
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:14,365
Can you understand that?
I am so sick of fucking the same person

1480
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,867
over and over and over
and over again.

1481
01:14:16,902 --> 01:14:18,460
(glass rattles)

1482
01:14:18,503 --> 01:14:20,528
Wow.

1483
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:22,540
That was frank.

1484
01:14:24,142 --> 01:14:26,576
She's gonna take a rain check
on the whole talking thing.

1485
01:14:26,611 --> 01:14:28,408
Thanks, though.

1486
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:34,543
Watch it. I...

1487
01:14:38,523 --> 01:14:41,185
- I'm gonna need another.
- Yeah.

1488
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,217
Excuse me?

1489
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:45,661
Scott:
All I'm saying is that...

1490
01:14:45,697 --> 01:14:47,665
both of you clearly
have some issues

1491
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,326
that you're not addressing
with each other.

1492
01:14:49,368 --> 01:14:52,064
But what happens if we address them
and then we break up?

1493
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:55,369
Look, relationships take work...
real work.

1494
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:59,206
You can't just pretend
that everything's okay

1495
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,235
so you don't have to
deal with the hard stuff.

1496
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:03,747
You have to be brutally
honest with each other.

1497
01:15:03,782 --> 01:15:05,409
Doesn't that hurt?

1498
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,179
It can.

1499
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:09,847
Love hurts,
but it's worth it.

1500
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:12,254
And that's why I'm chasing
after a girl

1501
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,622
who probably won't
even take me back.

1502
01:15:14,659 --> 01:15:18,060
Because if there's even the slightest
chance that she will,

1503
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,859
I have to risk it.

1504
01:15:19,898 --> 01:15:21,923
We can't play it safe
all the time.

1505
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:25,164
That's what it is with Ryan and me,
isn't it?

1506
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:27,865
We play it too safe.
We're so afraid of this thing failing,

1507
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:29,430
that we don't deal with it.

1508
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:32,932
- Anuptaphobia.
- Fear of being alone.

1509
01:15:32,978 --> 01:15:35,344
Why'd you do this?

1510
01:15:36,515 --> 01:15:39,848
- Do what?
- Try to help us,

1511
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:41,716
our relationship.

1512
01:15:41,753 --> 01:15:44,654
Well, at first it was
because I figured

1513
01:15:44,689 --> 01:15:47,089
the only way I was going to get
you two lunatics out of my life

1514
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,559
was if you got
your shit together, but...

1515
01:15:49,594 --> 01:15:52,757
actually I like you guys a lot,

1516
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,096
and I want you
to be happy.

1517
01:15:56,101 --> 01:15:58,433
You're a good friend, Scott.

1518
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:04,734
- Um, about the ménage thing...
- Mm-hmm?

1519
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:07,176
I don't know if you two
ever talked about,

1520
01:16:07,212 --> 01:16:09,112
you know, me in that way...

1521
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:12,514
Oh, no! Never.

1522
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:15,042
Okay, good, because
that would have been

1523
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:17,452
- a little weird.
- Yeah.

1524
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,316
Any particular reason why not?

1525
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:41,412
Well, this is it.

1526
01:16:41,446 --> 01:16:43,380
This is where Leslie is.

1527
01:16:43,415 --> 01:16:45,349
Are you ready?

1528
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:48,511
- Not in the least.
- Well, good luck.

1529
01:17:06,438 --> 01:17:07,996
Okay, dude,

1530
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:10,405
no more skateboarding
with your costume on.

1531
01:17:10,442 --> 01:17:13,275
If I have to fix your butt again,
I'm gonna kick it.

1532
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:14,608
Capisce?

1533
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,146
Okay, now get out of here.
Go.

1534
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:28,024
Hi.

1535
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,389
Hi.

1536
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,021
What are you doing here?

1537
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:35,294
I wanted to clear some things up.

1538
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:36,732
Can we talk?

1539
01:17:36,768 --> 01:17:39,134
Uh, okay.

1540
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,501
Okay.

1541
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:43,201
But just not here. Just...

1542
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,807
I've never been stalked before,

1543
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:54,410
so if you can give me, like,
an idea of how long this might take,

1544
01:17:54,452 --> 01:17:56,113
'cause I only have
40 minutes for lunch.

1545
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:59,248
I'm not stalking you.
At least not in the creepy way.

1546
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:01,521
There you are! Hi!

1547
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,461
There's nothing creepy
about this at all.

1548
01:18:04,496 --> 01:18:06,361
- Hi.
- Hi, Leslie.

1549
01:18:06,398 --> 01:18:09,299
Um, Mary and I just...

1550
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:11,564
wanted to make it clear

1551
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,902
that we did do everything
Scott said we did.

1552
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,432
We thought we could control
everything for him;

1553
01:18:18,476 --> 01:18:20,706
take away the risk
of getting hurt.

1554
01:18:20,745 --> 01:18:23,111
Thank you guys.
I've got it from here.

1555
01:18:23,148 --> 01:18:26,811
Just like we've been trying to do in
our own relationship for years.

1556
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:28,842
- But you can't do that.
- Nah.

1557
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:30,684
Nobody can.

1558
01:18:30,722 --> 01:18:33,520
A wise man once said to me,

1559
01:18:33,558 --> 01:18:37,460
"Love is all about
taking chances, even if it hurts."

1560
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:39,827
- So...
- Ryan: Which is why

1561
01:18:39,864 --> 01:18:43,231
Mary and I... (sighs)
Have decided...

1562
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:44,997
To split up.

1563
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:47,163
- Just for a while.
- It's just a trial thing

1564
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:49,833
to see if we're really meant
to be together.

1565
01:18:49,874 --> 01:18:52,809
So if we can take a chance...

1566
01:18:52,844 --> 01:18:54,937
Maybe you guys
can too.

1567
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,972
It was really great
meeting you, Leslie,

1568
01:18:58,016 --> 01:19:00,780
and we are sorry
about all of this.

1569
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:05,153
But I have a hunch you two
are going to be just fine.

1570
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:08,455
Hasta lasagna.

1571
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:16,160
So you're not a total psycho,

1572
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:18,032
but your friends are?

1573
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:19,969
Yeah, something like that.

1574
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:21,961
(sighs)

1575
01:19:23,608 --> 01:19:25,303
Can I buy you lunch?

1576
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:29,409
I am pretty hungry...

1577
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:31,438
and broke.

1578
01:19:32,651 --> 01:19:34,949
So yeah, okay.

1579
01:19:34,986 --> 01:19:38,353
But this does not mean
that I am moving in with you.

1580
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,881
- Right.
- And sex, is like, way down the road

1581
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:42,483
and we're not even
kissing anytime soon,

1582
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,688
and we have to completely start over
from, like, the very very very

1583
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:47,562
very very very beginning,
and there's no guarantees.

1584
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:50,727
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

1585
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:52,168
Okay.

1586
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:54,137
Okay.

1587
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:57,232
- I'm glad we talked.
- Yeah, me too.

1588
01:20:07,752 --> 01:20:08,844
Hey!

1589
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,752
(giggling)

1590
01:20:12,857 --> 01:20:14,848
(both laughing)

1591
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,862
And the Oscar goes to...

1592
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,126
Oh, you were fantastic.

1593
01:20:20,165 --> 01:20:22,326
No, you were fantastic

1594
01:20:22,367 --> 01:20:24,528
and they totally bought it.

1595
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:28,699
Well, love is all about
taking chances,

1596
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,765
even if it hurts.

1597
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:33,676
Give me a fucking break!

1598
01:20:33,712 --> 01:20:36,408
"Oh, we're gonna break up. We're just
gonna give it a trial break-up.

1599
01:20:36,448 --> 01:20:37,779
A little trial break-up thing..."

1600
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:40,376
"Just to see if we really are meant
to be together, you know."

1601
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,352
(both laughing)

1602
01:20:42,387 --> 01:20:44,753
Oh my God.
Ha ha ha!

1603
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:46,814
- Oh.
- He'll be back.

1604
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,586
(rock song begins)

1605
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:57,028
# Well, I live in Los Angeles #

1606
01:20:57,068 --> 01:21:01,471
# She said, "You drive in
this horrible traffic?" #

1607
01:21:01,506 --> 01:21:05,408
# Man, you can't hear
above the racket #

1608
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,741

- # From downtown #
- # Down down down #

1611
01:21:17,589 --> 01:21:20,922
# Couple nights
sleepless later #

1612
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:24,895
# She says "See the fire burn
in the city tonight #

1613
01:21:24,929 --> 01:21:28,592
# Under lines of
factory lights" #

1614
01:21:30,335 --> 01:21:32,496
