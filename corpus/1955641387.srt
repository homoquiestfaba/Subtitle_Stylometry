1
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:59,772
How could you let that happen?
You were supposed to short it.

2
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:02,975
- I don't care what the indicators said.
- Hey, Bobby, can you bring the car around?

3
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:06,578
We're gonna be ready to go
in like 10 minutes. Thank you.

4
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:11,165
Well, I operate on information,
not market trends. You know that.

5
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:14,587
- <i>This is Pierre.</i>
- Come on.

6
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:18,157
- <i>How may I help you?</i>
- Hello, Pierre, this is Mrs. Dutchman.

7
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:21,961
We're running about an hour behind so
I'm gonna need to push our reservation.

8
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,074
- Is that all right?
- <i>Not a problem.</i>

9
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:27,143
<i>Your table will be ready for you
whenever you arrive.</i>

10
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,421
Gorgeous.

11
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:37,791
- It's okay.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

12
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:41,596
But... there's something missing.

13
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:46,067
Close your eyes.

14
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,088
Happy 19th, baby.

15
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,976
Mark.

16
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:01,349
- It's... it's stunning.
- Just like you.

17
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,367
Only the best for my girl.

18
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:23,055
- I love you.
- Love you.

19
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:24,972
Let's go.

20
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,473
Welcome to the Boom Boom Room.

21
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,279
One drink and we're out.

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,701
We can raise whatever you need.

23
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:39,059
You believe that you Italians invented sex
whereas everyone knows...

24
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,342
- We could have a little private party.
- ...that we Greeks did.

25
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:44,744
- Hey.
- Hey.

26
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:48,414
So that cryptic message on the phone,
what are we talking about?

27
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:51,872
- Bronson and Jennings.
- The pharmaceutical company.

28
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,584
It's selling at 25,
come Monday, it's half that.

29
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:58,407
Their new cancer drug is shit.
It's getting squashed next week.

30
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:01,392
So we short B & J?

31
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:03,396
And buy up what's left with the profit.

32
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,932
- I didn't see you at the conservancy lunch.
- I know, I'm sorry, I couldn't make it.

33
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:10,903
- You know, there's an opening on the board.
- I know, but my plate is so full...

34
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:14,607
...and I was thinking
that Deanna would be perfect.

35
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:17,076
- I'd be honored to help out.
- We should talk.

36
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:22,046
- Positiv.
- What the fuck is Positiv?

37
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:25,551
The most successful female Viagra
the world has ever seen.

38
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,669
B & J holds the patent.

39
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,740
Now you have my attention.

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,260
Ladies, you know
it's my anniversary, so I am...

41
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,530
- Happy anniversary.
- Yes, say goodnight.

42
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,699
Well, in that case, I'll wire the funds.

43
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,235
- Use the...
- Yeah, yeah, the family account.

44
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,737
I know about the family account.

45
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:48,241
Family account? What are you boys plotting?

46
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,576
Our new summer house in South Hampton.

47
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:53,446
- Suzanne.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

48
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:55,197
Miss Sasha Lazard.

49
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,664
Taxi for you, Mr. Dutchman?

50
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:14,415
My driver's here, thanks.

51
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,271
How do you know my name?

52
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:21,374
I've seen you on Mad Money and The Crunch.

53
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:25,478
"Put your drive at the top of the list
and you become an unstoppable force."

54
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:28,782
- Not bad.
- Your words really hit home with me.

55
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,350
Keep watching, kid.

56
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,688
Sir, any chance a hard working guy
who's ready to put the job first...

57
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:38,424
...could catch a break and come work for you?

58
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,359
Why the hell would I give you a job?

59
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:43,546
How else is a guy from the outside
supposed to get in?

60
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,690
Give my office a call tomorrow.
We'll see if we can use you.

61
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,789
Now that is what I'm talking about.

62
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,879
What was that business with Howard
about the family account?

63
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,882
It's just an opportunity
that shouldn't be missed.

64
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:06,619
I know, but what did it have to do
with the family account?

65
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:08,821
Just tax reasons, baby.

66
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,557
Let me worry about the business, okay?

67
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:14,938
- I've done well so far, right?
- Excellent.

68
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,463
Did I tell you who called me the other day?

69
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:18,597
Who?

70
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:21,180
- Aaron.
- Steele?

71
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,502
- Your old boss, huh?
- Yes.

72
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:25,037
For what?

73
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:28,607
That they're looking for an executive editor
and he was wanting me to come back.

74
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:32,911
For what, 120 K a year plus dental?
Why bother?

75
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,487
Well, it's not really
about the money and it's...

76
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,652
Baby, between India and China
and this new deal with Howard...

77
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:44,273
...I need... I need all your attention
on me right now. All of it.

78
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,407
It's too important.

79
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,311
I love you so much.

80
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:56,168
Stop wasting my time, Lewis.
I don't want to hear it.

81
00:05:56,268 --> 00:06:00,341
Yeah, don't call me again
until it's done. All right?

82
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:03,859
We're only interested in alpha projects
with outsized returns.

83
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,078
Stop nodding when you
don't understand something.

84
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,646
- It's your worst tell.
- Tell?

85
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,849
Pick up a copy of Doyle Brunsen's
Super System.

86
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,318
Read it cover to cover by next week
or don't bother coming back.

87
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:14,253
- What's it about?
- Power poker.

88
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:17,056
- Got it.
- Don't say got it.

89
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:21,141
Faster than I would have given you
credit for, Lewis. Let's hear it.

90
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:26,231
You just earned your Hanukah bonus.
Congratulations.

91
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,067
- You play golf?
- Not well.

92
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,003
Learn. You only play the
Deep Dale Cub in Long Island.

93
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:33,107
Why the Deep Dale Cub?

94
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:37,978
You don't know something, act like
you do until you've figured it out.

95
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:41,854
And what if I can't figure it out, boss?

96
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:44,517
You can't figure it out,
join the fucking peace corps...

97
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:46,837
...'cause that means
you're not cut out for this game.

98
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:58,145
I should have my own show. Fuck Trump.

99
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:01,535
Fuck me.

100
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,676
That's a true story.

101
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:12,493
Oh, hold on.

102
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,763
My, my, my, I like this place. Indeed I do.

103
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,745
Excuse me, I have to go
speak to my concierge.

104
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:24,906
Yeah, give me that leg.

105
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,163
Are you sure you have enough?

106
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:33,906
My dear woman, I'm an aristocrat.

107
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:36,280
We always have enough.

108
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,306
You're facing real time, Howard.

109
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:44,370
And believe me, we would love
to see you do that time.

110
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,329
But there's something we'd love even more.

111
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:57,389
Inhale, the right leg up. Exhale, step
the right foot in between your hands.

112
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:01,293
Inhale, open up your chest. Exhale and
pop the left knee behind the right ankle...

113
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:05,431
...sit down seated, final twist.
Inhale, the right hand down, the left arm up.

114
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:08,200
Exhale, twist, look over your right shoulder.

115
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,247
Suzanne Dutchman?

116
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,546
Yes?

117
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:17,124
I'm gonna need you to come with me. Let's go.

118
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:48,340
What the hell is going on?

119
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,177
This is all Howard.
We are not guilty in any way.

120
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,756
Without his testimony, they ain't got shit.

121
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,655
Why are they holding you without bail?

122
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:01,353
You know they're saying
they're gonna charge me.

123
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,540
No, no, no, no. The lawyers
are going to straighten this out.

124
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:11,345
Listen to me. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

125
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:13,881
Okay?

126
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,525
- Is this your first time?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,728
- What made you come?
- Sorry?

128
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,763
Why did you volunteer?

129
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:48,094
I wanted to do something good
for the community.

130
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:52,361
When people see a blind man start to get
up, their instinct is to grab his arm.

131
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:54,172
- Big mistake with Bill.
- Got it.

132
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:57,476
Don't use hand signals.
Bill can still see some shapes and light...

133
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,612
...but he won't be able to discern
any waving or pointing.

134
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,596
No gesticulation.

135
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,903
I'll take two.

136
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,434
I'll take one.

137
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:10,455
Flush, jack high.

138
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:14,108
Sorry, Sonny, straight flush to the king.

139
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:15,793
Damn.

140
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:20,065
When you speak to a blind person,
don't omit words like see or look.

141
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,901
No one wants to be asked if they've
heard any good movies lately.

142
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,736
Got it.

143
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:29,775
Remember, he's a person. His disability
is only one feature of his personality.

144
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,112
- I know who he is.
- He doesn't like fans, either.

145
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:36,615
No, no, no, what are you doing
with that fucking thing?

146
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:40,352
If the luddites had persevered,
we'd all be a hell of a lot happier.

147
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,657
- I'll give this shit something to worry about!
- Becca, what's wrong?

148
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:46,024
I was trying to teach him
about the new GPS app...

149
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:50,195
...and he started screaming saying that
technology was gonna rob us of our humanity.

150
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:52,646
Good luck.

151
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:03,508
Gavin O'Connor, meet Bill Oakland,
our very own Indominus Rex.

152
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,111
You know I prefer the sound
of a lady's voice, Ella.

153
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,981
- Well, he's pretty like a lady.
- When are you going to run away with me?

154
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,816
When are you going to shave?

155
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:15,705
Everybody keeps talking about how beautiful
you are, Ella. But to me, it's your spice.

156
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,473
Gets me every time.

157
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:21,350
I'll see you in two hours,
you blind son of a bitch.

158
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,918
Hello, young man, come in, sit down.

159
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,784
Thank you.

160
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:34,273
- Speak.
- Excuse me?

161
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,575
I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.

162
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,811
- Sorry, I don't understand.
- Keep going.

163
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,514
- Keep going with what?
- For the love of God...

164
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:46,485
...would you connect three sentences together
so I'll have some sense of whether or not...

165
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:50,486
...the next two hours of my bleak
and blind life will be bearable...

166
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,023
- ...or torture to my ears. Could you do that?
- Yeah, I...

167
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:55,995
You're not doing community service, are you?

168
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,130
I volunteered.

169
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,967
Why? You got a hard-on for blind men?

170
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:05,510
- No, I couldn't get into your class.
- You're an undergrad.

171
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,140
- Sophomore.
- You couldn't get into my class...

172
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,510
...so you found out where I go to have
my students' stories read to me?

173
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,480
- Pretty much.
- I don't appreciate stalkers, O'Connor.

174
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm not.

175
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:26,431
- Seen any good movies lately?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

176
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,615
- Why are you here?
- I want to learn how to write.

177
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,092
- I don't teach people how to write.
- What about your students?

178
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,732
I teach them what not to write.

179
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,535
If they learn something from that,
that's their business.

180
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:38,560
Sorry I bothered you.

181
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,605
Jesus Christ! O'Connor...

182
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,990
...you're never going to get anywhere
in this world if you give up so easily.

183
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:48,334
- I mean...
- So you don't want me go?

184
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,987
Well, I don't particularly want you
to stay, you creepy fucking kid...

185
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,420
...but as you can see, there wasn't a line
of people begging to come in here and...

186
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,877
...read my students' mediocre stories
to me, now is there? So...

187
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,543
...proceed.

188
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:18,242
How To Love A Woman by Joseph Epstein.

189
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:20,226
Joey Epstein.

190
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,515
Jewish kid from the Bronx who thinks
he knows all the ins and outs...

191
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:26,685
- ...of how to love a woman.
- Well, does he?

192
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,187
- No.
- Does anyone?

193
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:30,856
One or two.

194
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,806
Do you?

195
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:35,549
Read.

196
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:41,633
Far, far away, behind the word mountains...

197
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,704
...far from the countries,
there lived the blind texts.

198
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:49,091
Separated, they lived in Bookmarks Groove.

199
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:53,056
<i>Right at the coast of a large language ocean.</i>

200
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:05,223
I guess sometimes people get in a rut
and can't see how to get out.

201
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:09,269
But what Momma must have forgot is,
there's always a way out.

202
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:18,171
Suzanne Dutchman, while your name
is on the account associated...

203
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:21,640
...with your husband's
alleged illegal activities...

204
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,444
...and while you did stand to profit
from your husband's actions...

205
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:29,181
...I do believe that you were not
fully aware of those activities.

206
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:35,302
Therefore I endorse your plea to 100 hours
of community service effective immediately.

207
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,846
Hey, Ella.

208
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,500
You platza?

209
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,836
- Excuse me?
- The Russian baths out in Brighton Beach.

210
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:54,573
- Platza.
- I'm still not following you.

211
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:59,010
They lay you down in a sauna and then
a big fat hairy Russian guy comes in...

212
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,055
...with an oil-dipped oak-leaf brush
and just beats the stress...

213
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,483
...right out of your back and shoulders.

214
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,845
Wow, people pay for this?

215
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,221
They say it keeps you young.

216
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:12,024
<i>I'm going this Saturday if you're curious.</i>

217
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,726
<i>Back to work, Jimmy.</i>

218
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:16,810
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

219
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:28,656
Thank you so much.
I'll see you soon, have a good one.

220
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,280
Hello.

221
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,182
I'm Suzanne Dutchman.

222
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,901
I think I'm supposed to report here.

223
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,821
Dutchman.

224
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,239
Docket number 2564.

225
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,968
Welcome to the Beacon for the Blind.

226
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,951
Right this way.

227
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:02,642
Always keep in mind his disability
is only one aspect of his personality.

228
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:07,612
Yeah, you'll get used to it. Use his name
when addressing him in a group setting.

229
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:09,096
Oh, hey, Janice.

230
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:13,409
- Don't ever push, poke or shove him.
- Of course not. Why would I do that?

231
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:17,122
Well, when people see a blind person start
to get up their instinct is to help him.

232
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,595
But with Bill, if he ever needs
any help, he'll let you know.

233
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:23,061
He can still see shapes and light,
but don't use any hand signals or gestures.

234
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,675
He won't be able to make them out.
And then one last thing...

235
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:28,833
...for the visually impaired,
feeling is seeing.

236
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,456
- So don't be alarmed if he touches you.
- Touches?

237
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,963
Just give me one minute. Bill?

238
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,642
- Bill.
- Yes?

239
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:41,313
Good news for you today.
We finally have a female reader for you.

240
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,462
- What does she look like?
- What do you care?

241
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,412
Well, I wasn't always blind.

242
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,402
Suzanne?

243
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:54,556
Suzanne Dutchman, meet Bill Oakland.

244
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,729
How do you do, Mr. Oakland?

245
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,864
Tough name to carry around
these days, I'm sorry.

246
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,467
- Excuse me?
- Dutchman.

247
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:07,939
The guy who wanted to lay off 3,000 workers
to make a buck that he didn't really need.

248
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,442
You must have heard of this sociopath.

249
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:14,027
Yes, I have.

250
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,514
He's my husband.

251
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:22,755
Well, I'm sure he's nice
once you get to know him.

252
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,724
I'll be leaving you two alone then.

253
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:29,342
Just... just one minute.

254
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:33,298
You're not leaving me
alone with him, are you?

255
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:36,705
- Yes.
- But are you sure that he's stable?

256
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,336
Stable?

257
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:42,741
He's not the one here because of
a court order, Mrs. Dutchman, you are.

258
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:46,672
And please keep in mind that if I report
one violation of your agreement...

259
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,681
...you will be remanded to prison.

260
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:54,449
- I... look, I don't want trouble. I just...
- Then don't commit any violations.

261
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:56,736
Okay.

262
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,265
Won't you sit down?

263
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,457
What would you like me to read first?

264
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:19,662
Before we get to that,
I'm just curious, why are you here?

265
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,964
I was given 100 hours of community service.

266
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,934
No, I mean, how did a nice girl like you...

267
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:29,718
...end up married to an asshole
like Mark Dutchman?

268
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:32,106
I don't have to explain myself to you.

269
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:34,222
Well, I already know
everything I need to know.

270
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,211
- Do you?
- Oh, my dear.

271
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:40,148
Even a visually impaired man
can see what you're all about.

272
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:42,667
- And what am I all about?
- I know your type.

273
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,066
- And what type is that?
- The type who loves...

274
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,824
...her enormous penthouse and her
ridiculously oversized diamond ring...

275
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:53,495
...enough to cast a blind eye
to all the heartless acts...

276
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,598
...her husband had to commit
in order to get her these things.

277
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,900
I don't have to tolerate this.

278
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,865
You know, it's actually my civic duty
perhaps to punish you just a little.

279
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:08,643
Your civic duty to punish me
for a crime I didn't commit...

280
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:10,679
...and something that you know nothing about.

281
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,782
You know what, go fuck yourself, Mr. Oakland.

282
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:16,900
It's go fuck yourself, Bill.

283
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:24,893
- I'd like to request a transfer.
- You're not allowed to leave the room.

284
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:28,863
Well, I did and I am not spending the next,
I don't know, however many months...

285
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:33,668
...reading to that cretin in a prison cell
of a room. He's absolutely repugnant.

286
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:36,602
Did someone tell you
this is supposed to be fun?

287
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:39,607
You have an hour and 40 minutes left.

288
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,459
And remember, one violation.

289
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,979
So I suggest you get back there.

290
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:46,529
Now.

291
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,191
Oh, my God.

292
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:58,526
Can we just start reading?

293
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,463
You know, it's rude to leave
the room without telling me.

294
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:04,733
I was sitting here talking
to you and now I don't know...

295
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,251
...what you heard and what you missed.

296
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:11,054
You could be nicer to me.

297
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:19,526
Look, we got off on the wrong foot.
Could we start over again?

298
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:21,698
No.

299
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,766
Why not?

300
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:26,449
Because I don't want to.

301
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:37,232
Why don't we begin with...

302
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:41,585
Margie Thompson, Jeannie Lost Her Way.

303
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:46,039
So, what's the latest with Mark?

304
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,393
When's he getting out?

305
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:53,197
He just keeps telling me not to worry.

306
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:56,599
But I'm worried.

307
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,489
Well, he's going to get out, right?

308
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,076
It's Mark, I'm sure
he's gonna figure out a way.

309
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:14,002
Can you believe that he
hasn't even apologized to me?

310
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:18,573
I don't know whatever this crap is
that he and Howard got into.

311
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,743
Using the family account, what an idiot.

312
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,849
- Everyone makes mistakes.
- Yeah, well, this is a big one.

313
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:29,818
At least you're not the one in prison.

314
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:33,856
After all, how bad could reading
to a blind man really be?

315
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,157
You try it.

316
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:38,393
- If it were me.
- Yeah?

317
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:41,996
I'd make the most of it. Have a little fun.

318
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:45,550
Why not? Try something outrageous...

319
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,304
...that you can only get away with
if you're stuck in a room with a blind man.

320
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:52,489
I mean, is he good looking?

321
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:58,796
Believe me, there is nothing fun
about spending time with this man.

322
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:05,119
<i>Hey, it's me calling, I just want to
let you know that I went to the store...</i>

323
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:08,857
<i>...and I'm gonna cook you
one hell of a sexy dinner.</i>

324
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:11,842
<i>So work up an appetite.</i>

325
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:17,246
<i>Hey, it's me calling.</i>

326
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:21,235
<i>Have I told you lately
how brilliant and bold...</i>

327
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:24,972
<i>...and how beautiful, and brave,
and all the other b-words...</i>

328
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:28,691
<i>...that mean perfect man, that you are?</i>

329
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:32,781
<i>In case you don't know
who's calling, this is your wife.</i>

330
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:35,898
<i>Anyway, I love you.</i>

331
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:44,792
- Hey, how it's going, Ella?
- Oh, Gaelin, how are you?

332
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:46,909
No, it's Gavin.

333
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:49,464
- Oh, sorry.
- That's all right.

334
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:51,911
We tried to call you but the number
you gave us didn't work.

335
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:54,669
Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to switch my service.

336
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:59,190
Bill's been assigned a court ordered reader
so he won't be needing you anymore.

337
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:05,094
Can I go up and say goodbye?

338
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,029
Please.

339
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:10,200
Pretty please.

340
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,070
Five minutes.

341
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,439
Thank you.

342
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:26,267
So I hear you finally got a woman's voice.

343
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:30,104
- Is that you, Gavin?
- The one and only.

344
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:32,450
Come in for a minute, sit down.

345
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,300
I just wanted to come by and say that...

346
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,682
...it's been real fun hanging out with you.

347
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,917
You are a true masochist, Gavin.

348
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:46,921
Well, the truth is my father
ran out on me when I was two.

349
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:51,283
- Hold on, let me get out my violin.
- Would you just listen to me for a second?

350
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,462
I got into a lot of fights as a kid.

351
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:57,065
- Good for you.
- My mother was great to me.

352
00:23:57,165 --> 00:24:00,200
She... she was really lonely.

353
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,372
Ended up with a really nice guy
and I should be thankful, but...

354
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:07,175
He wasn't a man, you know what I mean?

355
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,776
I might.

356
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:11,513
When I read "Throw it
on the Line for Venus..."

357
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:14,796
...for the first time in my life,
Bill, it was like...

358
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,785
...someone taught me
what it meant to be a man.

359
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:19,887
When did I tell you you could call me Bill?

360
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:23,191
- Seriously.
- What is it you want to say, Gavin?

361
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,042
You still live up to your book.

362
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,331
And I lied to you. I'm not enrolled at NYU.

363
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:33,234
I moved to New York two months ago
with 700 bucks in my pocket.

364
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:35,137
And you know what, Bill?

365
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:37,887
It was worth it.

366
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,129
Are you handy, Gavin?

367
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,417
What do you mean?

368
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:51,539
I have some projects I'm working on at home.

369
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:54,925
Maybe you could come by
and give me a hand this weekend.

370
00:24:57,524 --> 00:24:59,342
Call me on Friday.

371
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:02,044
Cool.

372
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,334
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.

373
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:09,452
No, not at all.

374
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,606
You're just in time to meet my protege.

375
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:15,176
The only kid crazy enough
to volunteer to read for me.

376
00:25:15,276 --> 00:25:17,912
Gavin O'Connor, meet Suzanne Dutchman.

377
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:20,665
- How do you do?
- Fascinated to meet you.

378
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:24,133
- Oh, why is that?
- I just can't imagine anyone...

379
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,888
...volunteering to spend time with this man.

380
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:31,659
Well, he's an acquired taste,
but he's worth it.

381
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,028
All right, Gavin, I'll talk to you on Friday.

382
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:38,181
- Thanks, Bill. It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

383
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:47,770
I'm sorry I talked to you that way.
I had no call to treat you like that.

384
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:54,182
Thank you. I appreciate your apology.

385
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:56,833
How was your day off?

386
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:00,336
It was fine.

387
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,606
That's good.

388
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:08,096
You still don't like me, do you?

389
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:10,431
Am I supposed to like you?

390
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,382
You might try.

391
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:18,596
I'm sure that you were self-centered
and narcissistic before your accident.

392
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:22,689
And now you're self-centered,
narcissistic and blind.

393
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:27,484
I brought you a present.

394
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:32,153
Is it a green tea candle?

395
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:34,337
It might be.

396
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:38,924
- Why, can you smell it?
- Yes. It stinks.

397
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,037
- You don't like green tea?
- No.

398
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:46,504
But I'll tell you what I do like.
I like your perfume.

399
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,846
Muguet de Bois.

400
00:26:51,072 --> 00:26:53,521
How do you know Muguet de Bois?

401
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:56,143
They don't make it anymore.

402
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,728
My stepmother used to wear it.

403
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,032
Well, she's got good taste.

404
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:07,470
Yes. In everything except men.

405
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,593
So do I just take one
from the top of the stack?

406
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:17,031
Yes, and please get rid
of that foul smelling candle.

407
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:20,883
- It really does stink in here.
- You'll get used to it.

408
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:36,350
So where are we?

409
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,260
The grand jury's being sworn and they're
gonna start to hear evidence soon.

410
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,756
- How long?
- It's impossible to say at this time...

411
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:44,659
- ...but you know, maybe 3 or 4 weeks.
- Not good enough.

412
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,863
Mark... I need you to take
an honest look at what you're facing.

413
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:53,284
There's a possibility of you
doing substantial time.

414
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:56,603
Your associate is testifying against you.

415
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:00,643
Arnold, let me ask you something.

416
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:07,063
Why the fuck am I paying you
$1200 an hour for?

417
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:10,451
- To represent your interests.
- Tell me again?

418
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:14,388
- To represent your interests.
- So why are you telling me the obvious?

419
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:18,359
Do your job, stop dicking around
and get me the fuck out of here.

420
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:19,909
Okay.

421
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:23,534
Thank you, my beautiful wife is here.

422
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,301
- Hello, Arnold.
- Mrs. Dutchman.

423
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,585
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

424
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,657
Any progress?

425
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,246
I have faith in the legal system.

426
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:41,515
Is he saying how long?

427
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:44,467
Soon. Soon.

428
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,972
- Are you doing okay in here?
- It's not a situation I can't handle.

429
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:55,926
Where's your ring?

430
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,039
I didn't think it was a good time
to be flaunting what we have.

431
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:02,218
I want that ring on your finger. You hear me?

432
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:06,280
- Mark...
- There's nothing to be ashamed of.

433
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:09,326
It's just a little uncomfortable.

434
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:15,731
- Tell me about the community service.
- It's fine.

435
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,185
What do you want to know?

436
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:21,844
This blind man you read to.

437
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,380
What's he do?

438
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,595
He was a novelist and now he teaches.

439
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,696
Teaches.

440
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:32,233
- What's his name?
- Bill Oakland.

441
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,503
He wrote that book,
"Throw it on the Line for Venus."

442
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:39,707
- It made a lot of money.
- He doesn't have a lot of money now.

443
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:41,408
What'd you think?

444
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:44,193
- Of the book?
- Yeah.

445
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:46,929
I never read it.

446
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:52,553
"She put down her book, leaned back and
clasped the paper knife tightly in both hands.

447
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:56,690
"There was nothing to be ashamed of.
She called up all her Moscow memories.

448
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,254
"She recalled the ball, and Vronsky
and his humble, enamored gaze...

449
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:03,038
"...and their relations with one another.
There was nothing to be ashamed of."

450
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:06,340
Hold on. Hold on.
Why are you reading it that way?

451
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,920
- What way?
- As if it has no meaning.

452
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,405
This is the most
important moment in the book.

453
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:15,687
This is the moment that Anna realizes
that she can no longer go on...

454
00:30:15,787 --> 00:30:19,213
...bullshitting herself
that she's happy with her life.

455
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:22,006
- Okay.
- And once you cross that line...

456
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:25,506
...you either have to make the terrifying
change that will alter your life...

457
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,832
...in ways you can't imagine...

458
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:30,458
- ...or.
- Or?

459
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,159
You take the safe route.

460
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:36,330
To live out the rest of your days
drowning in that familiar security...

461
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,108
...while at night your dreams are filled
with feasts you never touched...

462
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:43,052
...and love you never tasted.

463
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:49,009
Why aren't you saying anything?

464
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,313
I thought I was supposed to be
reading your students' stories.

465
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:56,363
I'm teaching Karenina next semester.
I wanted to get reacquainted.

466
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,200
Okay, sorry, I'm...

467
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:01,689
- Where were we?
- "Nothing to be ashamed of."

468
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,825
Right. "There's nothing to be ashamed of.

469
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:06,752
"And yet...

470
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:10,231
"...at this very point
of her recollections...

471
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,269
"...the feeling of shame was intensified...

472
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,336
<i>"...just as though when she
was thinking about Vronsky...</i>

473
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:19,488
<i>"...some inner voice said to her,
warm, very warm, hot.</i>

474
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,044
<i>"While she said to herself resolutely
changing her position on the seat...</i>

475
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:27,014
<i>"...what about it? What does it mean?</i>

476
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:30,984
<i>"Am I really afraid to look straight
at what passed between us?</i>

477
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:34,420
<i>"Well, what did pass between us,
is there really...</i>

478
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,491
<i>"...can there be anything more
between myself and that boy officer...</i>

479
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:41,678
<i>"...than there is between me
and every one of my acquaintances?"</i>

480
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:57,118
Oh, honey pot, you like your Chanel No. 5.

481
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:18,426
<i>"Something in my blood was screaming out...</i>

482
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:22,029
"...at the top of his lungs,
can we still save the big easy?"

483
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:24,330
Can we open the window?

484
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:30,787
- I'm sorry, would you repeat that?
- Can we open... open the window?

485
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:37,044
If I may, please don't break
the rhythm of a sentence...

486
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:39,313
...to ask some question.

487
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:42,750
I mean, the kid was getting close
to writing a halfway decent line...

488
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,918
...and now the rhythm is lost to me.

489
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:47,890
It's just really uncomfortably hot in here.

490
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,541
- What is going on with you today?
- Nothing.

491
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:54,577
Is everything okay?

492
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,665
Everything's fine, it's just...

493
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:00,149
...it's just hot.

494
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:06,740
Look, it isn't easy to edit
when you can't look at the words.

495
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,846
I'm sure you understand.
We can't open the window...

496
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:13,512
...because the noise from outside
makes it hard for me to...

497
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:16,883
...follow the rhythm of each sentence...

498
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:20,000
...paragraph, page, so...

499
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,505
...can you help me?

500
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,287
Yes, yes.

501
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:29,396
"The snake...

502
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:32,339
"...of the river below...

503
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:36,470
"...as you fly into the city
is a good portent for the balance...

504
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,256
"...between sweet and sinister
one encounters in New Orleans.

505
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:46,047
"The winding river works
his way through her center...

506
00:34:46,547 --> 00:34:50,292
"...providing the city with life
knowing all the time...

507
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:53,319
"...he can take it away on a whim.

508
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:57,424
"Down by the river, in the heart of
the quarter, there stands a statue.

509
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:00,761
"Old man river, a man with a past.

510
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:03,530
"Arms reach empty handed...

511
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,632
"...God to a city in love with..."

512
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:07,433
Wait.

513
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:10,704
- What just happened?
- I don't know, he kinda lost me here.

514
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,855
No, I mean with you.

515
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:18,022
- Nothing.
- Your scent just changed.

516
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:22,165
- What do you mean my scent?
- Your pheromones got stronger.

517
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,604
Hey, Bill, just getting the...

518
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:30,223
- ...trash.
- Hey, Joey.

519
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:32,693
How's that Shakespeare workshop coming?

520
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,662
Just great, Bill.

521
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:38,726
- In fact, it's fan-fucking-tastic.
- That's good to hear.

522
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:42,904
Okay, then... you two have a good time.

523
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,623
Where were we?

524
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:52,761
"God to a city in love with water."

525
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:57,598
Hi.

526
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,453
It was just really,
really hot in there today.

527
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,241
What?

528
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,911
I feel like I'm going crazy.

529
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:12,125
Like I'm... like I'm losing my shit.

530
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:14,835
I don't even know what's real anymore.

531
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:18,338
I don't even know if I know
who Mark is anymore.

532
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:21,108
I don't even know if I know who I am.

533
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:24,811
Well, I know who you are
and I think you're fucking fabulous.

534
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,728
That's real.

535
00:36:27,513 --> 00:36:29,983
Do you think Mark's a good guy?

536
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,903
What? I mean, yeah, of course.

537
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:37,692
Do you really think that he's a good man?

538
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,794
Yes. Why would you ask me that?

539
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,018
He's having an affair.

540
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,548
My God.

541
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,535
Are you sure?

542
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:50,603
I'm sure.

543
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:52,706
Do you know who she is?

544
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:54,656
Not yet.

545
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:57,044
God, I feel so stupid.

546
00:36:57,144 --> 00:37:00,547
- You're not stupid.
- No, I really, I feel so stupid.

547
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:02,684
Like such an idiot.

548
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:10,506
Fuck him. What are you gonna do?

549
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:15,028
I don't know,
it feels like it's all falling apart.

550
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:17,330
- Suze.
- Literally everything...

551
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,871
...everything is falling apart.

552
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,786
But something has to change...

553
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,992
...'cause this isn't working.

554
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,946
What you looking for?

555
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:53,215
I was just checking to make sure
this is the right place.

556
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,836
- The right place for what?
- I'm looking for a friend of mine.

557
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:57,671
- Papi, who?
- Bill Oakland.

558
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:00,607
Yeah, this is the right place.
I'm the super, he expecting you?

559
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:02,809
- Yeah.
- Hey, you want a beer?

560
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:05,213
Thanks, but it's a little early for me.

561
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:09,240
Don't ever let people tell you how to live.

562
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:12,818
Bill's on the second floor.

563
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,873
- Thanks, man.
- You got it, buddy.

564
00:38:41,514 --> 00:38:43,065
Bill?

565
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:46,034
I'm back here.

566
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:50,305
Hey.

567
00:38:57,763 --> 00:39:00,018
Welcome, Gavin, make yourself at home.

568
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:03,372
Gee, thanks.

569
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:07,506
So...

570
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:10,916
...what's this project you're talking about?

571
00:39:21,554 --> 00:39:25,192
You know this wasn't really what I had
in mind when you said projects.

572
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:27,742
Scrub.

573
00:39:40,472 --> 00:39:42,540
You don't have a vacuum cleaner?

574
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:45,073
No.

575
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,254
- Bill.
- I don't entertain much.

576
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:53,485
So what are you having me do all of this for?

577
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,490
You ever see the Karate Kid?

578
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,471
Yeah.

579
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,531
You're awfully quiet, Gavin.

580
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:37,816
I just had an idea for a short story.

581
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:41,869
See, there's a method to my madness.

582
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:43,749
Right.

583
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:00,353
I'll be out soon, baby.

584
00:41:00,453 --> 00:41:04,067
Best assured you won't be doing
community service any longer.

585
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:08,744
It's not that bad, actually.

586
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:11,947
Not that bad?

587
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:19,067
What, you like reading to this guy?

588
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,942
No, it's not that.

589
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:26,061
It just feels good to be productive again.

590
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:29,616
What's that supposed to mean?

591
00:41:29,716 --> 00:41:32,968
I need stability outside of you.

592
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,408
Why would you say that?

593
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:39,808
Why?

594
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:42,462
Because you made choices.

595
00:41:42,562 --> 00:41:44,732
Choices that you didn't consult me on.

596
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:49,002
You know how many choices I make in a day?

597
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:51,705
Am I supposed to consult you on every one?

598
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:54,441
I don't care how many decisions
you have to make.

599
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:57,611
I care about this decision
which landed you here...

600
00:41:57,711 --> 00:41:59,912
...and implicated me.

601
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:01,882
We're not guilty!

602
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:06,019
Howard is. You'll understand that
when I'm out of this hellhole...

603
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,205
...and you won't have to read
to any fucking cripple anymore.

604
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:15,595
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.

605
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:17,865
Just this place is getting to me.

606
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:20,882
You can... listen to me.

607
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,285
I got your back, huh?

608
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,974
You can depend on me.

609
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:29,458
I promise you.

610
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:37,050
So how come you never finished
your second book?

611
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,254
- How come you never finished your first?
- I'm building life experience.

612
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:44,758
What's your story, Gavin? You got a girl?

613
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:48,715
There's a girl. I'm just waiting
for the moment to present itself.

614
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:52,464
- What's she like?
- Well, you know her.

615
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,436
You mean Ella?

616
00:42:56,536 --> 00:42:58,939
- Yeah.
- Forget it.

617
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,775
- What?
- Don't stop cleaning, by the way.

618
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,945
You are definitely not ready
for a girl like that.

619
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:10,066
You might not know this, Bill,
but I am a very good-looking guy.

620
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:13,353
That's so funny, because you
don't come across like one.

621
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:15,989
Well, I was voted best
looking guy in high school.

622
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:20,775
Not enough for a quality woman,
a keeper like Ella.

623
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,944
And besides, your looks are
only one part of the equation.

624
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:26,199
So what's the rest?

625
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:30,369
Smarts, humor, money.

626
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:33,106
The ability to make her feel safe.

627
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:37,291
The... the unpredictability of a great lover.

628
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,981
So I got four out of five,
with potential for money.

629
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,784
- How you gonna make money?
- Writing.

630
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:45,733
What?

631
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:50,657
One day, you're gonna meet a girl.

632
00:43:50,957 --> 00:43:53,560
And she's gonna be
lying in your arms in bed...

633
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,104
...and everything is just...

634
00:43:56,504 --> 00:43:58,364
...going to make sense.

635
00:43:58,797 --> 00:44:03,020
Jesus, Bill. You're getting me
all hot and bothered over here.

636
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,107
No, but seriously, when was the last time?

637
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:10,277
You know, the last time
you were with a woman?

638
00:44:10,877 --> 00:44:12,579
Not since my wife.

639
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:15,916
- Jesus!
- Your sympathy is much appreciated.

640
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:18,518
I'd lose my fucking mind.

641
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:22,261
- How do you know I haven't already?
- Oh, that explains a lot.

642
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:29,780
Hey, Bill, I'm leaving.

643
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:38,052
Bill.

644
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:44,826
Gavin!

645
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:46,749
What?

646
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:51,296
I didn't expect you to work
for the privilege of my company.

647
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:53,553
I don't want to take your money, Bill.

648
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:57,090
I'm not offering you money,
you presumptive little shit.

649
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,912
I'm inviting you to sit in on my class.

650
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:05,165
- You mean that?
- Consider it a token of my appreciation.

651
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:07,582
Thank you, Bill.

652
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:10,703
You're all right, O'Connor.

653
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:15,074
- Not the worst you ever met, right?
- You're quoting my book.

654
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,992
Get the fuck out of here.

655
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,097
What's your problem, Michelle?

656
00:45:37,197 --> 00:45:40,651
I don't know how many more
of these parties I can do.

657
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:47,837
Well, the party is in my honor.
It would be rude not to show up.

658
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:55,730
Rude? How about how rude it is
that you're never home anymore?

659
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,634
Our strong readers
could come in three hours early.

660
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:18,338
And then you can do the rounds
I would normally be doing...

661
00:46:18,438 --> 00:46:22,065
...when I'm talking to the volunteers that
first come here. That would be helpful.

662
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:25,878
And then there was one other thing
that I wanted to ask you.

663
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:28,681
Oh, hey, Bill. You're here early.

664
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:31,551
I just thought I'd do a little cleaning
before she gets here.

665
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:34,716
Oh, my. You do windows too?

666
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,140
Anyway, where was I?

667
00:46:50,836 --> 00:46:55,069
I must be in the wrong room.
I was looking for Bill Oakland.

668
00:46:56,642 --> 00:46:58,660
You inspired me.

669
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:01,062
I inspired you?

670
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:03,950
Every time you walk in this room...

671
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,754
...you make me feel something
I thought I never would again.

672
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:09,592
And what's that?

673
00:47:10,322 --> 00:47:11,839
Possibilities.

674
00:47:18,164 --> 00:47:21,916
- Do you need to get that?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

675
00:47:31,176 --> 00:47:33,013
Is everything okay?

676
00:47:33,713 --> 00:47:36,434
Yes. Great.

677
00:47:39,384 --> 00:47:41,654
May I ask you to do something for me?

678
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:43,804
Sure.

679
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:49,155
It's a lot to ask, but you'd
really be doing me a big favor.

680
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,467
I used to love the smell of this.

681
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:00,407
Reminds me of when I was a kid.

682
00:48:01,107 --> 00:48:04,277
My father injured himself
in a grilling accident...

683
00:48:04,377 --> 00:48:07,080
...and I had to shave him for two weeks.

684
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,383
That sounds so naughty, but I love it.

685
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:12,367
Don't be obscene.

686
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:15,600
We're all just trying to get home, I suppose.

687
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:22,028
I'm about to put an extremely
sharp razor against your neck.

688
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:24,931
I would choose my next words carefully.

689
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:27,248
They could be your last.

690
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,018
I'm in your hands.

691
00:48:48,253 --> 00:48:49,805
Nice.

692
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,024
How many times did you say
you shaved your father?

693
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:56,917
I was a kid.

694
00:48:57,997 --> 00:49:02,068
Look, I need to get your chin.
There you go, stretch it out.

695
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:03,718
Sexy.

696
00:49:06,538 --> 00:49:08,389
How do I look?

697
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:13,895
Very handsome.

698
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,105
<i>Suzanne Dutchman.</i>

699
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:52,503
What's up, homes?

700
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:57,972
What's the matter? You got ass-burgers?

701
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:03,421
- What?
- Ass-burgers.

702
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:06,766
You anti-social or something, hey?

703
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:09,135
You mean Asperger's?

704
00:50:09,835 --> 00:50:14,675
No, I don't. I just don't particularly
want to talk right now, okay?

705
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:18,361
Listen to this particular motherfucker.

706
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,296
From now on, you don't eat.

707
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:27,068
You bring your food, you put it on a tray
and you bring it to me.

708
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:31,681
Big Ricky G. <i>Entiendes?</i> You understand?

709
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:37,365
Didn't your mother teach you
not to touch another man's brownie?

710
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:41,121
What the fuck did you say about my mother?

711
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:56,636
Break it up, break it up!

712
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:14,928
<i>Now exiting subway.</i>

713
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:20,365
<i>Your destination is 200 feet straight ahead.</i>

00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:25,047

715
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:28,162

<i>Turn right.</i>

718
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,551
Hello.

719
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:53,618
- Oh, you're here early.
- I am.

720
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:56,157
How are you today?

721
00:51:56,641 --> 00:52:00,260
Well... I'm doing okay.

722
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:04,532
- How are you doing?
- I'm pretty good.

723
00:52:05,283 --> 00:52:08,736
What would you like to
start with today? Maybe...

724
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:12,151
Margie Thompson? "Get her out of the way."

725
00:52:13,775 --> 00:52:17,795
I want to go to the park.
I want you to take me to the park.

726
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:21,967
I'm not allowed to leave the room.

727
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:24,851
I know, so...

728
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,522
...we'd better not get caught.

729
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:38,084
- I want to hold onto you.
- But I don't know if I know how to do this.

730
00:52:38,184 --> 00:52:40,268
It's okay, I'll show you.

731
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,725
- How you doing, boss?
- What'd you find?

732
00:52:45,825 --> 00:52:49,896
She reads to him two hours, three times
a week and then she goes home.

733
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:51,982
That it?

734
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:55,067
Yeah, I don't think you got
anything to worry about there.

735
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,670
Have you seen what my wife looks like?

736
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,189
Yes, boss, but he's blind.

737
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:05,088
That doesn't make him a eunuch.

738
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:10,230
I'm on it, Mr. Dutchman. Take care.

739
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:17,624
I feel like we're the bad kids
ditching school to go smoke.

740
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:20,427
- What's wrong with that?
- You were one of the bad kids.

741
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:23,062
I was as a matter of fact,
but that's a long time ago.

742
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:25,698
Isn't this pond just beautiful?

743
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:28,901
And that rock face over there,
its just exquisite. Don't you think?

744
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:33,606
Yes, I do. It's stunning.
Do you still remember what it looks like?

745
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:35,775
Oh, yes, yes, I do.

746
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:39,178
I have to reimagine it over
and over again so I don't forget.

747
00:53:39,278 --> 00:53:43,716
No, it's the other things
that are hard about going blind.

748
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:45,975
- Like what things?
- You have to...

749
00:53:46,075 --> 00:53:48,676
...relearn everything like a child.

750
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:52,789
How to wash yourself.
How to boil water. How to function.

751
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:56,726
It took me a year just to get up the nerve
to step outside my apartment.

752
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,335
Well, and now look at you,
escorting me to the park.

753
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:04,319
What are the chances?

754
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,543
- Is this the ball field?
- Yes.

755
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:13,448
- You know what I like about this ball field?
- What's that?

756
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:16,883
Is that I can walk around here
without my hands in front of my face.

757
00:54:16,983 --> 00:54:19,523
You don't walk around
with your hands in front of your face.

758
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,489
That doesn't mean I live without that fear.

759
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:27,193
You know, I played football on this field
every weekend until I was 40.

760
00:54:27,593 --> 00:54:29,895
- Are there kids on the field right now?
- No, we're...

761
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:32,413
Okay, then hit me long!

762
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,699
Bill!

763
00:54:35,366 --> 00:54:36,669
Oh, shit.

764
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:38,137
Bill!

765
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:40,005
Bill!

766
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:42,475
Bill, are you okay?

767
00:54:42,575 --> 00:54:45,645
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

768
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:47,580
Don't ever do that again.

769
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,886
- Wait.
- What?

770
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,200
I think I can see.

771
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:57,523
Shit, we're gonna be late.
Get... get up, come on.

772
00:54:57,623 --> 00:54:59,907
Get up, get up.

773
00:55:09,868 --> 00:55:12,004
- She's there.
- Let's take the stairs.

774
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:14,040
10 o'clock, 10 o'clock.

775
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,191
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

776
00:55:18,543 --> 00:55:20,980
"When she read how Lady Mary
rode to the hounds...

777
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,782
"...teased the bride and astonished...

778
00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:25,818
- "...everybody by her boldness..."
- It's 4:04."

779
00:55:25,918 --> 00:55:28,788
Ella, if I could have another moment
with Mrs. Dutchman.

780
00:55:28,888 --> 00:55:31,994
- I want to hear the end of this chapter.
- Yeah, well, that's up to her.

781
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:35,776
Oh, it's a page and a half. It's fine.

782
00:55:38,162 --> 00:55:40,395
Okay, suit yourself.

783
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:50,591
- What is it?
- It's a leaf.

784
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:56,697
Hi.

785
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:48,601
Okay, okay, now you all know I respect
y'all's opinions, but I'm sorry.

786
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:50,536
Can we please just talk about...

787
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:55,608
...the obvious latent homosexuality
rampant throughout this chapter?

788
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,044
I mean, the blood, the flesh...

789
00:56:58,144 --> 00:57:00,413
...and the 11 Greeks
piling out of Camille's house...

790
00:57:00,513 --> 00:57:04,250
...and Dean stays in bed for three days.

791
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:09,755
Hello? Is there any question that Sal
wants to stick it up Dean's ass?

792
00:57:09,855 --> 00:57:12,458
Hey, come on. A little respect, please.

793
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:16,162
Oh, I'm sorry, did you have another
interpretation, homophobe?

794
00:57:16,262 --> 00:57:18,364
I see on the road as being a little deeper...

795
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:21,567
...than Sal just wanting
to stick it up Dean's ass, yes.

796
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:24,770
Darling, you can go as deep as you like.

797
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,807
I think Kerouac's saying Dean is Christ.

798
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:31,527
- Closeted!
- All right, enough of this shit.

799
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:36,182
A writer is always entitled
to his intention just as the reader...

800
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:40,386
...is always entitled to his
interpretation of the work.

801
00:57:40,486 --> 00:57:44,073
A lot of people think that Kerouac
was, as Kyle put it, closeted.

802
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:47,451
But when it comes to on the road
I tend to agree with O'Connor...

803
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,929
...in terms of Kerouac's intention.

804
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:54,246
Page 185, Dean says "they came into
the room and found me lying on the bed...

805
00:57:54,346 --> 00:58:00,381
"...my arms stretched out forever."
This is after three days, page 186.

806
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:02,742
"They unwrapped the bandages and showed me.

807
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:06,378
"The flesh, about half an inch,
was missing under the nail..."

808
00:58:06,478 --> 00:58:10,931
...which could be an interpretation
of a stake going through the hand.

809
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:13,208
The 11 greeks?

810
00:58:13,985 --> 00:58:17,022
How about the 11 apostles,
Sal being the 12th...

811
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,773
...which makes Dean...

812
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,597
All right now, get the hell out of here
and go get some experience.

813
00:58:37,175 --> 00:58:40,660
Bill, thanks for letting me sit in.

814
00:58:41,346 --> 00:58:43,583
You're better than the rest of them.

815
00:58:44,383 --> 00:58:48,435
- You mean that?
- I told you not to ask me stupid questions.

816
00:58:50,054 --> 00:58:52,106
See you later, Bill.

817
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:05,571
"I think about that night every day,
but still he haunts me.

818
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:10,358
"He hovers over my bed at night
and whispers in my dreams.

819
00:59:10,942 --> 00:59:14,762
"I still have integrity.
What are you left with?"

820
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:16,716
The end.

821
00:59:16,816 --> 00:59:20,019
I'd say that's a step up for Joey Epstein.

822
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:23,552
I'd hate to see his early works.

823
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:26,726
What are you reading now?

824
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:30,161
Franzen. Although I...

825
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:34,884
...did just come across
this really interesting writer...

826
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:36,985
...Bill Oakland.

827
00:59:39,871 --> 00:59:41,403
So...

828
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:47,460
- ...what did you think?
- I was pleasantly surprised.

829
00:59:47,979 --> 00:59:50,883
It certainly wasn't the worst I've ever read.

830
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:54,286
You... know what this means, don't you?

831
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:58,357
- No, what does this mean?
- You must have dinner with me tonight.

832
00:59:58,457 --> 00:59:59,825
What?

833
00:59:59,925 --> 01:00:03,496
Come with me to Brooklyn,
and I'll take you to Paris.

834
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:05,831
Paris?

835
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,934
Everybody knows that Brooklyn
is the new Paris.

836
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,551
- Really?
- <i>Bien sur.</i>

837
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:14,373
Well, it's been a long time
since I've been to Paris.

838
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:16,507
- So?
- So.

839
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:18,486
What do you say?

840
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:23,131
Brooklyn it is then.

841
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:36,428
Hello.

842
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:38,345
Allow me.

843
01:00:41,866 --> 01:00:44,467
Chivalry is not dead among the blind.

844
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,305
Milla...

845
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:52,660
...may I have a vodka
on the rocks, and for you?

846
01:00:54,078 --> 01:00:57,365
- Just a glass of red wine. Thank you.
- Red wine.

847
01:01:00,752 --> 01:01:02,603
Thank you for coming.

848
01:01:03,488 --> 01:01:05,257
Thank you for inviting me.

849
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:08,047
You're probably wondering
why I asked you to come to dinner.

850
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:11,797
No, I was actually asking
myself why I said yes.

851
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,634
Well, I am guilty of a crime...

852
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:19,238
...that I would never forgive
someone else for committing.

853
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:24,124
I judged a book by its cover
and I misjudged you.

854
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:29,481
And in spite of your ridiculously
oversized diamond ring...

855
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:31,253
...I was wrong about you.

856
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:33,649
You're not at all...

857
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:35,824
...what I thought you were.

858
01:01:37,622 --> 01:01:42,628
Well, I actually misjudged you as well.

859
01:01:43,228 --> 01:01:47,717
I said that you were self-centered,
narcissistic and blind...

860
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:52,706
...and I realized that you're
self-centered, narcissistic, blind...

861
01:01:52,806 --> 01:01:54,655
...and a little charming.

862
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:58,592
Thank you.

863
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:03,850
Thank you, Wes.

864
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,992
So maybe we can start over.

865
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,872
To starting over.

866
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:18,164
Do you like to travel?
I love Paris. Do you love Paris?

867
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:23,702
I do love Paris, in fact,
it's my favorite place in the whole world.

868
01:02:23,802 --> 01:02:28,389
I begged my father to take me
on my 13th birthday.

869
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:33,879
And I got there and it felt
like this was home.

870
01:02:33,979 --> 01:02:37,182
And I was determined to live there.

871
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:39,284
That was my plan.

872
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:42,187
I was gonna go there, write poetry...

873
01:02:42,287 --> 01:02:45,133
...sit in cafes and smoke cigarettes.

874
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,028
- Did you end up living there?
- No.

875
01:02:49,128 --> 01:02:50,978
Why not?

876
01:02:51,629 --> 01:02:54,430
Just... just life and...

877
01:02:55,129 --> 01:02:58,804
...you know, it just seemed
like it was a romantic notion...

878
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,388
...of a teenage girl and...

879
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:05,744
...and, you know, it didn't fit Mark's...

880
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:08,414
...agenda of building an empire.

881
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:12,332
'Cause for him, business is pleasure.

882
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:14,721
And that's pretty much it.

883
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:18,706
The cage with the golden bars.
I know it well.

884
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,962
I never planned to stay in New York.

885
01:03:23,062 --> 01:03:27,029
I always thought I would end up
in Paris like the lost generation...

886
01:03:27,129 --> 01:03:31,618
...or better yet in some seaside
town in the south of France.

887
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:37,079
And once I learned that you don't
need a lot of money to travel...

888
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:38,810
...I was hooked.

889
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:42,140
I went all over Europe
with very little in my pocket.

890
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:47,820
Who cared if the bed was lumpy
or the bathroom was down the hall.

891
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,058
The cheese was splendid and the wine
was out of this world, so...

892
01:03:52,158 --> 01:03:54,008
...what more do you need?

893
01:03:55,226 --> 01:03:58,396
That truly sounds heavenly.

894
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:00,515
Except for the lumpy bed.

895
01:04:08,106 --> 01:04:10,142
And here we are.

896
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:14,713
How do you know this is where it's at?
That's amazing. Really impressive.

897
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:17,783
- Hey, Bill, how ya doing?
- Well, hey, Frank.

898
01:04:17,883 --> 01:04:22,154
Frank, this is Suzanne. Suzanne, this is
Frank. Frank's the super of our building.

899
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:24,256
How do you do?

900
01:04:26,457 --> 01:04:28,825
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

901
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:32,431
I tell people like it is
and you are a beautiful woman.

902
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:36,035
In fact, the two of you look pretty
freaking beautiful together.

903
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:39,204
Bill, what'd you do? The Botox.

904
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:43,375
No, Frank, it's just a shave,
but I appreciate the thought.

905
01:04:43,475 --> 01:04:46,812
- Hey, no problem.
- Nice to meet you.

906
01:04:50,047 --> 01:04:52,866
- Quite a colorful character.
- Yes.

907
01:04:53,884 --> 01:04:58,089
Thank you for a really lovely evening.

908
01:04:58,189 --> 01:05:00,088
Where are you going?

909
01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:04,363
I'm... I'm gonna go home.

910
01:05:04,463 --> 01:05:07,324
Wait a minute, you came all this way,
and you're not at least curious...

911
01:05:07,424 --> 01:05:10,402
...to see what a blind man's
apartment looks like?

912
01:05:10,502 --> 01:05:13,625
Well, I didn't realize that it was different.

913
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:17,390
Come on.

914
01:05:20,344 --> 01:05:22,162
Thank you.

915
01:05:22,847 --> 01:05:26,986
Can I get you something to drink?
Would you like a glass of wine?

916
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:28,854
- Sure, that sounds lovely.
- White or red?

917
01:05:28,954 --> 01:05:32,372
- Red is perfect.
- Good, because all I have is red.

918
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:37,562
Is this your office?

919
01:05:37,662 --> 01:05:39,212
Yes.

920
01:05:47,606 --> 01:05:49,742
You look good on the track.

921
01:05:49,942 --> 01:05:54,179
Well, it's how I put myself through school.

922
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:56,748
Is this postcard from the south of France?

923
01:05:56,848 --> 01:05:59,818
Yes, it's from the Cote d'Azur,
my favorite place in the world.

924
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:01,953
The town is called Eze.

925
01:06:05,223 --> 01:06:07,293
Your wife is very pretty.

926
01:06:07,993 --> 01:06:09,561
Thank you.

927
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,317
No kids?

928
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:14,063
No, I...

929
01:06:14,163 --> 01:06:16,426
...I realized that I...

930
01:06:16,526 --> 01:06:20,788
...couldn't be a good father
and good writer, so no kids.

931
01:06:22,206 --> 01:06:26,680
- How about yourself?
- We tried for a long time, but...

932
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,230
...it didn't work.

933
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:36,803
Here you are.

934
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:39,557
Straight, 12 o'clock.

935
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:43,393
Thank you.

936
01:06:44,162 --> 01:06:48,861
So tell me, dinner at the French
restaurant, the stroll...

937
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:52,161
...the wine...

938
01:06:52,261 --> 01:06:56,864
...I don't know, is this part
of the normal Bill Oakland routine?

939
01:06:59,377 --> 01:07:04,231
Actually, I haven't had a woman
up to this apartment in...

940
01:07:05,712 --> 01:07:07,517
...five years.

941
01:07:09,453 --> 01:07:12,083
Well, I guess then I should be honored.

942
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:16,628
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

943
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:18,597
I can see shapes.

944
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:21,935
I can make out your skin tone, but...

945
01:07:23,835 --> 01:07:25,704
...what do you look like?

946
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:29,308
I have brown hair, hazel eyes.

947
01:07:29,408 --> 01:07:32,859
No, what do you look like?

948
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:43,570
Why don't you see for yourself?

949
01:08:11,732 --> 01:08:13,954
I can see that you're beautiful.

950
01:08:17,254 --> 01:08:19,856
And I can see that you're fragile.

951
01:08:24,195 --> 01:08:26,835
I wanna see the way that you see.

952
01:08:28,098 --> 01:08:29,983
How you see me.

953
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:04,844
I can see that you're fragile too.

954
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:04,044
Suzanne?

955
01:10:10,368 --> 01:10:11,918
Suzanne?

956
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:25,098
Hello?

957
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:29,755
Okay.

958
01:10:30,303 --> 01:10:32,498
Yeah, okay.

959
01:10:33,491 --> 01:10:36,528
I have a reservation at Versailles at 7:00.
You think I'll make that?

960
01:10:36,628 --> 01:10:39,814
- Yes.
- All rise.

961
01:10:53,577 --> 01:10:58,934
Due to the untimely death of our key
witness, the government has no choice...

962
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:02,706
...but to drop all charges
against Mark Dutchman.

963
01:11:21,337 --> 01:11:22,901
Mr. Dutchman, excuse me!

964
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:27,346
Mr. Dutchman, what do you think happened
to your former associate Howard Cunningham?

965
01:11:27,446 --> 01:11:30,281
Howard Cunningham told lies
about me and I'll never know why.

966
01:11:30,381 --> 01:11:33,206
But let's get one thing straight. I am...

967
01:11:34,706 --> 01:11:38,941
...I am still grieving over the freak
accident that took my friend's life.

968
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,884
That's all I have to say.

969
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:45,199
Sir, did you have any comments?

970
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:51,359
Didn't I tell you that
it was going to work out?

971
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:54,220
You did.

972
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:58,425
Home sweet home.

973
01:12:08,018 --> 01:12:09,903
What's wrong?

974
01:12:12,523 --> 01:12:14,998
What really happened to Howard?

975
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,112
He got hit by a bus.

976
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:22,782
Karma's a bitch.

977
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:30,824
I had nothing to do with Howard's death.

978
01:12:41,018 --> 01:12:42,829
How is your blind man?

979
01:12:47,391 --> 01:12:50,560
I guess he'll be sad now he
doesn't get to sit in his little room...

980
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,877
...jerking off about my wife.

981
01:12:58,502 --> 01:13:00,589
Thought you'd be happy about that.

982
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,891
Of course I am.

983
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,795
I'm gonna take a bath.

984
01:13:31,716 --> 01:13:32,703
Yeah.

985
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,464
So they dropped all the charges.

986
01:13:40,327 --> 01:13:44,213
So this is it? This is your last session?

987
01:13:46,616 --> 01:13:49,427
I don't know how I could justify coming.

988
01:13:51,188 --> 01:13:54,829
Well, you could volunteer.
You do charity work all the time.

989
01:13:59,163 --> 01:14:01,180
You're not a charity case.

990
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:20,201
You're not coming back, are you?

991
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:22,669
Please come back.

992
01:14:28,025 --> 01:14:30,443
- Please come back.
- No.

993
01:14:36,066 --> 01:14:37,917
Oh, yeah.

994
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:43,803
You're welcome, Mr. Dutchman.

995
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:06,865
- What are you doing here?
- Just in the neighborhood.

996
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:08,466
Did Mark have you follow me?

997
01:15:08,566 --> 01:15:10,869
I don't know what you're talking about,
Mrs. Dutchman.

998
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,397
What, you feeling guilty or something?

999
01:15:16,673 --> 01:15:20,178
- What's it gonna take?
- Not to tell him?

1000
01:15:20,278 --> 01:15:22,382
I don't know if I can put a price on that.

1001
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,262
Try.

1002
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:44,284
Not tonight.

1003
01:15:46,103 --> 01:15:48,111
Are you fucking kidding me?

1004
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:52,091
I'm tired.

1005
01:16:12,763 --> 01:16:14,299
Hey.

1006
01:16:14,599 --> 01:16:17,502
- What'd you find?
- Nothing.

1007
01:16:20,003 --> 01:16:23,424
- Nothing?
- I mean, she reads to him.

1008
01:16:25,575 --> 01:16:28,128
- That's it?
- That's it, boss.

1009
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:34,867
Are you lying to me, Landry?

1010
01:16:35,787 --> 01:16:37,217
No.

1011
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:41,893
You're fired.

1012
01:16:41,993 --> 01:16:43,243
Fired?

1013
01:16:44,695 --> 01:16:46,447
You got a hearing problem?

1014
01:16:48,532 --> 01:16:50,569
You sure that's a good idea?

1015
01:16:51,269 --> 01:16:52,637
I'm sorry?

1016
01:16:52,773 --> 01:16:56,026
Well, considering everything I know about
you and given your current standing...

1017
01:16:56,126 --> 01:16:59,301
...with the US attorney,
are you sure that's a good idea?

1018
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:03,748
Now, that's the kind of spirit
I like to see in my team.

1019
01:17:03,848 --> 01:17:07,245
Maybe you're not such a pussy after all.
There may be hope for you yet.

1020
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,087
Thank you, Mr....

1021
01:17:09,187 --> 01:17:12,523
Fuck, fuck.

1022
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:16,657
No, boss.

1023
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:19,364
If I even dream, you ratted me out...

1024
01:17:19,464 --> 01:17:23,478
...I'll take your fucking head off
with this golf club. You hear me?

1025
01:17:23,578 --> 01:17:25,223
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:17:25,323 --> 01:17:29,155
Now I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1027
01:17:30,107 --> 01:17:34,281
Is my wife having an affair
with the blind man?

1028
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:38,385
- Is she?
- Yes!

1029
01:17:40,183 --> 01:17:42,436
Yeah, yes!

1030
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:50,310
Fuck.

1031
01:17:54,398 --> 01:17:57,869
"He soaked in the intoxication
of her scent...

1032
01:17:57,969 --> 01:18:01,539
"...before diving headfirst
into her holiness.

1033
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:04,542
"Sending her into a paroxysm of pleasure...

1034
01:18:04,642 --> 01:18:06,882
"...she did not know existed...

1035
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:10,849
"...before his gentle touch."

1036
01:18:13,784 --> 01:18:15,988
You fuck as good as you write?

1037
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:19,325
Who do I have the pleasure of addressing?

1038
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:22,614
Mark Dutchman.

1039
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:24,611
Suzanne's my wife.

1040
01:18:25,195 --> 01:18:28,032
Dutchman's not your real last name, is it?

1041
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:32,036
- What makes you say that?
- Your voice has a ring of Queens to it.

1042
01:18:32,136 --> 01:18:37,035
Polished, but you can never take all the
Far Rockaway out of there, now can you?

1043
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:41,060
- And where are you from?
- Brooklyn.

1044
01:18:42,646 --> 01:18:44,883
You got balls for a blind man.

1045
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:47,377
I'll give you that.

1046
01:18:53,957 --> 01:18:56,728
What is it you do for my wife?

1047
01:18:56,828 --> 01:19:00,431
- I don't wanna fight with you, Mark.
- No, I wanna know.

1048
01:19:00,531 --> 01:19:03,961
I need to know. What is it you do?

1049
01:19:05,452 --> 01:19:07,830
You really need me to spell that out for you?

1050
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:13,325
I'm gonna say once, only once.

1051
01:19:14,478 --> 01:19:17,296
Do not see Suzanne again.

1052
01:19:17,914 --> 01:19:19,799
That's fine.

1053
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:23,021
Just don't ask me to keep my hands off her.

1054
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:29,594
You think you can say that shit to my face...

1055
01:19:29,694 --> 01:19:32,961
...and I'm gonna give you a pass
because you're blind?

1056
01:19:34,232 --> 01:19:35,786
No.

1057
01:19:36,213 --> 01:19:38,336
No, Mark, no.

1058
01:19:38,436 --> 01:19:40,862
I... I want you to...

1059
01:19:41,334 --> 01:19:44,374
...treat me just like any other guy
that's banging your wife.

1060
01:19:46,743 --> 01:19:48,779
What the fuck is going on in here?

1061
01:19:49,257 --> 01:19:51,097
Get your hands off me.

1062
01:19:52,582 --> 01:19:54,586
What's wrong with you?

1063
01:19:55,406 --> 01:19:57,236
Get out of here.

1064
01:20:03,493 --> 01:20:05,512
Remember what I said.

1065
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:13,052
You alright, Bill? Hey.

1066
01:20:21,378 --> 01:20:23,263
You remember this?

1067
01:20:29,386 --> 01:20:33,410
I had never been as happy in my life
as I was in that moment.

1068
01:20:39,096 --> 01:20:40,831
You love him?

1069
01:20:40,931 --> 01:20:43,810
- Mark.
- Tell me.

1070
01:20:46,803 --> 01:20:48,688
I don't know.

1071
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:55,151
I forgive you.

1072
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:58,762
Just end this thing with him.

1073
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:01,223
Oh, I don't know if I forgive you.

1074
01:21:02,586 --> 01:21:04,409
I've made mistakes.

1075
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:07,640
Everyone makes mistakes. Even you.

1076
01:21:08,925 --> 01:21:10,762
But we can change.

1077
01:21:11,162 --> 01:21:12,979
I've changed.

1078
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:21,872
You know what I thought of
when I was in prison?

1079
01:21:21,972 --> 01:21:24,039
You know what got me through?

1080
01:21:25,575 --> 01:21:27,126
You.

1081
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:30,299
The thought of coming home and holding you.

1082
01:21:31,182 --> 01:21:33,033
That's the only thing that held me together.

1083
01:21:33,133 --> 01:21:35,405
Is that why you had me followed?

1084
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:45,883
What do I have to do to keep the one
uncorrupted thing left in my life?

1085
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:50,034
Just tell me what you need, Suzanne. Tell me.

1086
01:21:50,134 --> 01:21:52,739
And I swear to God I'll give it to you.

1087
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,707
You're my everything, baby.

1088
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:59,226
You know that, everything.

1089
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:04,034
I know...

1090
01:22:04,134 --> 01:22:06,972
...I know you think you love him...

1091
01:22:07,072 --> 01:22:09,120
...but let me tell you something.

1092
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,732
Bill...

1093
01:22:12,882 --> 01:22:14,938
...Bill's a short story.

1094
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,576
I'm your novel.

1095
01:22:18,128 --> 01:22:20,205
Novels are work sometimes...

1096
01:22:20,305 --> 01:22:23,201
...but the short story,
it doesn't go on to the next day.

1097
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:25,418
It doesn't endure.

1098
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:29,273
It's fun for a while, but then fun runs out.

1099
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:33,446
Then you realize,
there's no new chapter to turn to.

1100
01:22:36,012 --> 01:22:38,595
I don't know what this is anymore.

1101
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:41,267
I don't know you.

1102
01:22:45,321 --> 01:22:47,140
Don't leave me.

1103
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:51,224
Don't, I can't live without you.

1104
01:22:53,062 --> 01:22:54,913
I can't.

1105
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:58,706
Please don't leave me.

1106
01:23:00,137 --> 01:23:03,874
Please don't leave me. Not when
my whole fucking world is falling apart.

1107
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:05,688
Baby, please.

1108
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:07,960
Please, baby.

1109
01:23:09,713 --> 01:23:11,598
I need you so much.

1110
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:18,208
And I need you. I need you.

1111
01:23:20,089 --> 01:23:21,940
I need you.

1112
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:47,232
- Suzanne, is that you?
- Yes, yes, it is.

1113
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:50,139
Please come in.

1114
01:23:53,423 --> 01:23:57,928
You are not going to believe
the kind of day I've had.

1115
01:23:58,028 --> 01:24:01,747
I actually was inspired to write.

1116
01:24:02,665 --> 01:24:04,517
That's great.

1117
01:24:05,134 --> 01:24:07,305
What happened to your face?

1118
01:24:07,405 --> 01:24:13,460
Nothing, I... I bumped into something
when I was doing something.

1119
01:24:15,845 --> 01:24:18,090
May I offer you...

1120
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:21,137
...a glass of champagne?

1121
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:26,591
I'm sorry, Bill, I... I can't do this.

1122
01:24:26,691 --> 01:24:29,594
You can't drink champagne
in the middle of the day?

1123
01:24:29,694 --> 01:24:32,530
No, I... this can't go any further.

1124
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:35,691
I'm married. It's...

1125
01:24:36,417 --> 01:24:38,500
...it's not right, it's...

1126
01:24:39,203 --> 01:24:41,221
It's only wrong...

1127
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:43,212
...if you stay with him.

1128
01:24:44,741 --> 01:24:46,811
Do you still love him?

1129
01:24:46,911 --> 01:24:49,327
- He's my husband.
- That's not an answer...

1130
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:52,125
...Suzanne.

1131
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:56,778
Yes, I still love him.

1132
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:05,279
I don't believe you.

1133
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:14,620
I am sorry, Bill. I have to... I have to go.

1134
01:25:26,116 --> 01:25:27,632
Suzanne...

1135
01:25:28,302 --> 01:25:30,119
...good to see you.

1136
01:25:31,855 --> 01:25:33,673
Nice to have you around.

1137
01:25:39,629 --> 01:25:41,232
- Frank!
- Yeah?

1138
01:25:41,332 --> 01:25:44,017
- Which way did she go?
- To the left.

1139
01:25:46,636 --> 01:25:48,187
Suzanne!

1140
01:25:56,513 --> 01:25:58,164
Suzanne!

1141
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:02,388
Suzanne!

1142
01:26:08,925 --> 01:26:13,445
Jesus. Buddy? Buddy? Buddy, are you okay?

1143
01:26:13,643 --> 01:26:16,663
- You okay? Hey, come on.
- Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

1144
01:26:18,301 --> 01:26:20,170
Hey, you're looking to get yourself killed?

1145
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:23,441
- You got him, you got him?
- Yeah, I got him. Breathe, okay.

1146
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:26,934
- Frank? Is that you, Frank?
- Yes, it's me. It's me, Bill, I'm right here.

1147
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:29,713
I'm right here. You got hit by a cabbie.

1148
01:26:29,913 --> 01:26:32,315
- My stick?
- I got your stick right here.

1149
01:26:32,415 --> 01:26:35,101
- Don't move, don't move. I'm right here, yeah.
- Buddy, you okay?

1150
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:15,520
<i>Hey.</i>

1151
01:27:15,941 --> 01:27:17,744
<i>It's me calling.</i>

1152
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:22,281
<i>I just wanted to tell you to be nice tonight.</i>

1153
01:27:23,232 --> 01:27:27,100
<i>You've been a grouch
for the last three nights and...</i>

1154
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,045
<i>...I'm feeling kinda fragile, so...</i>

1155
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:34,660
<i>...please just be nice tonight, okay?</i>

1156
01:27:35,712 --> 01:27:37,529
<i>I love you.</i>

1157
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:45,155
Michelle, this cannot come
as a surprise to you...

1158
01:27:45,255 --> 01:27:47,287
...but I want a...

1159
01:28:38,525 --> 01:28:40,412
What's going on here?

1160
01:28:41,812 --> 01:28:43,629
I lost something.

1161
01:28:45,648 --> 01:28:47,184
I took it.

1162
01:28:47,284 --> 01:28:48,934
What?

1163
01:28:50,186 --> 01:28:51,737
Here.

1164
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:58,362
Nothing Left To Win Or Lose.
When I was cleaning your apartment.

1165
01:28:58,462 --> 01:29:01,732
I would have told you, but I knew
you wouldn't let me read it.

1166
01:29:01,832 --> 01:29:04,902
- That's because it's not finished.
- But it's not far.

1167
01:29:05,002 --> 01:29:06,819
Goddammit!

1168
01:29:07,637 --> 01:29:10,948
- How dare you?
- Are you gonna finish it?

1169
01:29:11,508 --> 01:29:14,560
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it.

1170
01:29:14,977 --> 01:29:17,314
- I'm gonna finish it.
- What are you, what are you...

1171
01:29:17,414 --> 01:29:19,665
No, stop!

1172
01:29:20,282 --> 01:29:21,986
- Let it burn, Gavin!
- No!

1173
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:23,919
Let it burn!

1174
01:29:31,828 --> 01:29:34,678
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Why don't you mind your own business?

1175
01:29:34,778 --> 01:29:38,602
Why don't you get off your ass and do
what you were put on this earth to do?

1176
01:29:38,702 --> 01:29:41,505
It's time to move on.
Enough with the self pity shit!

1177
01:29:41,605 --> 01:29:43,974
You're blocked. Change up the scenery.

1178
01:29:44,074 --> 01:29:45,876
I'm blind, Gavin.

1179
01:29:46,476 --> 01:29:49,762
The scenery doesn't change... ever.

1180
01:29:50,313 --> 01:29:53,463
- Everyone makes their excuses.
- Come on.

1181
01:29:53,563 --> 01:29:56,720
But it's only the losers
who quit because it's not fair.

1182
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,624
- Please.
- Nobody said it had to be fair.

1183
01:30:00,424 --> 01:30:03,694
- All right, so?
- Well, you wrote that.

1184
01:30:05,328 --> 01:30:08,533
If you wanna give up, that's your business.

1185
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:13,144
But if you need help in getting your
life together, then you give me a call.

1186

<i>Do we all cave eventually?</i>

1187
01:30:49,106 --> 01:30:52,442
<i>Convince ourselves
not to take the final leap?</i>

1188
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:55,147
<i>Just when our dreams are within reach.</i>

1189
01:30:58,381 --> 01:31:03,075
<i>The opposite of love
is not hate, but indifference.</i>

1190
01:31:04,087 --> 01:31:07,706
"He saw that the spring had sprung...

1191
01:31:07,806 --> 01:31:13,081
"...the food was gone. But no mouse.

1192
01:31:13,663 --> 01:31:15,966
"You see, the mouse would come
in the middle of the night.

1193
01:31:16,066 --> 01:31:19,937
"She called for my grandfather. "Papa," he
came quickly! "What's the matter?" He asked.

1194
01:31:20,037 --> 01:31:22,873
"There's a mouse in our house," she yelled.
"But the mouse was gone.

1195
01:31:22,973 --> 01:31:26,165
"Don't worry," said papa. The next morning...

1196
01:31:26,265 --> 01:31:29,562
<i>However the Nemesis of love is fear.</i>

1197
01:31:33,015 --> 01:31:35,501
<i>Fear creeps into you.</i>

1198
01:31:36,052 --> 01:31:38,003
<i>Builds up walls.</i>

1199
01:31:38,588 --> 01:31:40,841
<i>Traps you inside yourself.</i>

1200
01:31:42,558 --> 01:31:45,995
<i>Fear strangles you, slowly...</i>

1201
01:31:46,095 --> 01:31:47,598
<i>...subtly...</i>

1202
01:31:47,698 --> 01:31:51,984
<i>...until one day there's
nothing left to win or lose.</i>

1203
01:32:00,242 --> 01:32:03,073
<i>Nothing left but the thirst...</i>

1204
01:32:03,173 --> 01:32:05,664
<i>...for the one drink you don't have.</i>

1205
01:32:09,051 --> 01:32:11,557
<i>Nothing left, but the memory...</i>

1206
01:32:11,657 --> 01:32:15,459
<i>...of the one pair of lips
that could have saved your soul.</i>

1207
01:32:15,759 --> 01:32:19,814
<i>If only fear hadn't kept you
from taking the leap.</i>

1208
01:32:31,874 --> 01:32:35,112
Okay, that's great. Thank you so much.

1209
01:32:35,212 --> 01:32:38,282
- All right, bye.
- How are you?

1210
01:32:38,382 --> 01:32:40,918
Oh, Mrs. Dutchman.
I didn't know you were reading today.

1211
01:32:41,018 --> 01:32:43,220
No, no, I'm not.

1212
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,823
And please call me Suzanne.

1213
01:32:45,923 --> 01:32:48,173
Okay, Suzanne.

1214
01:32:48,591 --> 01:32:52,244
Do you know where he is, Ella?

1215
01:32:52,929 --> 01:32:57,021
Bill? No, not a clue, he just vanished.

1216
01:32:58,935 --> 01:33:03,986
But by the way, it was really nice
to see you reading to those kids.

1217
01:33:04,674 --> 01:33:06,725
They really loved you.

1218
01:33:16,485 --> 01:33:18,036
Hey.

1219
01:33:19,055 --> 01:33:22,192
- Suze, hi.
- What are you doing here?

1220
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:23,754
I...

1221
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:28,266
...I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by to...

1222
01:33:28,528 --> 01:33:30,532
...see if you want to have lunch.

1223
01:33:34,003 --> 01:33:36,288
That Chanel No. 5?

1224
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:39,258
Every now and then it's fun.

1225
01:33:55,021 --> 01:33:56,885
Honey pot.

1226
01:34:02,999 --> 01:34:06,018
He likes five minute eggs, not three.

1227
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:17,753
Hey, I was just gonna call you.

1228
01:34:17,853 --> 01:34:19,883
Wanna grab some lunch?

1229
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:22,334
Don't... don't do that.

1230
01:34:22,752 --> 01:34:25,971
- What's wrong?
- I'm done.

1231
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:29,128
I am...

1232
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:32,280
...really done.

1233
01:34:35,031 --> 01:34:39,084
- Are we really gonna go through this again?
- No, we're not.

1234
01:34:42,038 --> 01:34:44,089
Deanna will love that.

1235
01:34:48,044 --> 01:34:49,933
All I ever wanted...

1236
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:52,393
...was for you to be happy.

1237
01:35:37,952 --> 01:35:40,713
- Hello, Bill.
- <i>Bonjour,</i> Jean.

1238
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:19,302
Hello, Bill. How are you today?

1239
01:36:19,402 --> 01:36:22,559
<i>Ça va Marie, et vous?</i> How is your little dog?

1240
01:36:22,659 --> 01:36:25,222
Still peeing on the sofa,
but what can you do?

1241
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:28,556
Well, either kill him
or learn to live with it.

1242
01:36:28,656 --> 01:36:31,314
- Like men?
- Well, not all men.

1243
01:36:31,414 --> 01:36:33,450
All of them.

1244
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:37,169
- The usual?
- The usual, Marie. <i>S'il vous plait.</i>

1245
01:37:11,854 --> 01:37:14,024
You think today is the day?

1246
01:37:14,524 --> 01:37:16,842
Today is as good as any day.

1247
01:37:17,643 --> 01:37:20,129
That's what you say every day.

1248
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:26,313
Bill...

1249
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:29,581
...why do you never offer a glass to me?

1250
01:37:33,042 --> 01:37:35,693
Because it's for me.
