An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.
(M. K. Gandhi)

3
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:49,251
It's stuffy in here.

4
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:18,459
<i>Natalie, where's the water?</i>

5
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,209
<i>What do you need?</i>

6
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:22,376
Ah, I've found it.

7
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:24,292
- Fine, okay.
- Thanks.

8
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:27,167
We'll have some coffee first.

9
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,126
- Evening.
- Evening. - Hi.

10
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,584
- What an honor!
- Mario.

11
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:20,001
- Michael, hi. How's things?
- Fine.

12
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,876
- Good to see you.
- You've gotten older.

13
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:25,834
What can you do? In this job?
Stairs up, down, up, down...

14
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,501
Talking of work,
your last zero fuel weight was...

15
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,459
I'm sorry, my German isn't very good.

16
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,292
<i>See you.</i>

17
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,084
- Evening, madame. You're with the gentleman?
- Yes.

18
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,167
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

19
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,334
Welcome aboard.
Welcome, good evening.

20
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:59,376
- Is that it?
- I think so. - Okay, I'll do the final check.

21
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:03,834
Please put your rucksack
under the seat in front of you.

22
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:24,376
Would you put
your bag under the seat, please?

23
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,876
I think that's it.

24
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,417
Welcome aboard.
You're lucky we waited.

25
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,667
<i>It's her fault.</i>

26
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,584
Allahu akbar!

27
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,876
<i>Everyone to the back!</i>

28
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,334
<i>Come on move! Everyone to the back!</i>

29
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,126
<i>Everyone to the back! Everyone to the back!</i>

30
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,584
<i>Everyone to the back!</i>

31
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,251
Kinan! Kinan!

32
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,667
Yes, I'm fine.

33
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,917
I'm all right.

34
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,709
Everything's okay.

35
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,167
<i>Open the fucking door, or I'll kill him!</i>

36
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:52,167
<i>Hello?</i>

37
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:58,292
<i>What have you done to Kinan?</i>

38
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,376
<i>He's American.</i>

39
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,001
<i>You're a fucking American?</i>

40
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:12,334
<i>He's not to land!</i>

41
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:16,001
<i>Tell him I'll kill him!</i>

42
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,834
- <i>You should leave him alone.</i>
- <i>Then he should open up!</i>

43
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,584
<i>Tell him he's got ten seconds.</i>

44
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:43,084
<i>Tell him I'll really do it.</i>

45
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,792
<i>He won't open the door!</i>

46
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,084
<i>Help me!</i>

47
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:51,917
<i>Ten...!</i>

48
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,501
<i>Nine...!</i>

49
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,542
<i>Eight...!</i>

50
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:01,417
<i>Seven...!</i>

51
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:03,876
<i>Six...!</i>

52
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,209
<i>Please help me! Help me!</i>

53
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:16,792
<i>Five...!</i>

54
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:18,917
<i>Four...!</i>

55
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,417
<i>Help me!</i>

56
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:26,917
<i>Three...!</i>

57
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:25,667
<i>We can land soon and negotiate with them.</i>

58
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,209
<i>No one's going to land here!</i>

59
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,626
<i>What are you doing?</i>

60
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,084
<i>No, no, no!</i>

61
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,626
<i>Daniel, no!</i>

62
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:06,542
<i>I'm not doing anything!
I'm not doing anything!</i>

63
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:11,542
<i>Please! I have a child, I have a child!</i>

64
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:14,042
<i>Daniel, he won't open the door!</i>

65
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:19,959
<i>Hello!</i>

66
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:36,209
<i>Please! I have a child. Please!</i>

67
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:45,167
- <i>Daniel, he'll kill Kinan.</i>
- <i>Tell him to go ahead!</i>

68
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:48,792
<i>Something else is waiting for us.
I'm not afraid to die!</i>

69
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:52,626
<i>Do you think you can threaten me?</i>

70
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,376
<i>Don't anyone dare to come closer!
I'll kill her!</i>

71
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:31,251
<i>I'll kill her! All of you stay where you are!</i>

72
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,834
<i>Why don't you understand?</i>

73
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:48,584
<i>Wanna try it? Go ahead!
Bring it on, all of you! I dare you, you cunts!</i>

74
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,292
<i>Please! I have a child, I have a son!</i>

75
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:08,417
<i>I have a child, a son. Please!</i>

76
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:11,042
<i>Please don't, please don't!</i>

77
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,042
<i>I'm a Muslim!</i>

78
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,542
<i>She's a Muslim. She's like us.</i>

79
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:19,834
- <i>She's not a Muslim!</i>
- <i>I am a Muslim!</i>

80
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:22,584
<i>Shut up! I've had enough!
Open the door!</i>

81
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:24,542
<i>Five!</i>

82
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:27,417
- <i>Four!</i>
- <i>Daniel, please!</i>

83
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,876
<i>Daniel, stop it! Daniel!</i>

84
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:08,084
<i>I've had enough of this bullshit!
I've had enough!</i>

85
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,292
<i>Open the door!</i>

86
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,001
<i>Three!</i>

87
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:14,709
<i>Two!</i>

88
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:16,626
<i>One!</i>

89
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:20,417
<i>He's going to open it.
He's going to open the door!</i>

90
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:27,251
<i>Let her go!</i>

91
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:34,209
- <i>He's shitting us.</i>
- <i>He isn't, he's going to open the door.</i>

92
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:46,167
- <i>That's enough! Shut up!</i>
- <i>No! Daniel!</i>

93
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:04,084
<i>Daniel? Daniel?
The passengers! The passengers!</i>

94
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:58,792
<i>Come on, open the fucking door!</i>

95
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:00,792
Come on! Come on!

96
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,084
Where are you?

97
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:07,209
<i>Come on! Vedat!</i>

98
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,334
The door's open! The door's open!

99
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:13,542
Hurry! Close the door!

100
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:15,834
Hurry!

101
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:21,667
Help me up.

102
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:24,959
Come on, help me up!
Help me up!

103
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:29,709
Hurry!

104
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:31,667
Watch out!

105
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:37,917
Everything's okay!

106
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:41,751
- Calm down. Are you okay?
- There was so much blood...

107
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:43,876
- Calm down...
- He just stabbed her...

108
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:47,626
- Are you hurt?
- She screamed so loudly...

109
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,751
Are you all right?

110
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,959
Okay, listen to me!

111
00:46:52,834 --> 00:46:54,751
- Listen to me!
- Daniel and Kalkan!

112
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:59,584
- There's no one else left but you and me, okay?
- Daniel and Kalkan! - Look at me!

113
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:03,667
<i>Just the two of us!
I love you. We'll soon be done.</i>

114
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:07,459
Everything will be okay. We don't need that.

115
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,709
What are you doing? What are you doing?

116
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:16,626
- I want to know what's happening to Daniel. Daniel and Kalkan!
- Okay...

117
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:20,001
Everything's okay.

118
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:24,709
Kill him!

119
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,334
Kill him!

120
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:29,667
Just kill him!

121
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:31,709
Go on.

122
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:04,792
Seven, six...

123
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:13,709
What are you doing? Huh?

124
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:15,834
Why don't you kill him? Stab him!

125
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:17,417
Stab him!

126
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,209
Hello? Is anyone there?

127
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:37,459
Can anyone hear me?

128
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,334
<i>Yes, we can. Who are you?</i>

129
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:45,209
I'm in control. Both your pilots
are dead, so you can give up all hope.

130
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:48,501
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- This isn't a hijacking!

131
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:54,417
This plane is about to crash. We're ready
to die and there's nothing you can do.

132
00:48:54,626 --> 00:48:59,292
And I know very well
that your laws forbid you to shoot us down,

133
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:02,209
so listen carefully, okay?

134
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:07,126
Today, we're avenging the deaths
of our brothers and sisters.

135
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:10,459
Every day,
Muslims are slaughtered by you Westerners.

136
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:14,667
Now you're going to find out what it's like
when your children and families die.

137
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:19,334
Your damned egoism and rotten lies
cause new suffering every day, but...

138
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:22,334
But now it's our turn.

139
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:26,417
Now you're going to burn for your sins.
Allahu akbar.

140
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:29,292
Allahu akbar.

141
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:35,251
Okay, here we go. Don't be afraid.

142
00:49:37,292 --> 00:49:39,459
- Okay, autopilot...
- <i>European 162, can you hear me?</i>

143
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,792
<i>Tell me your demands.</i>

144
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:44,584
<i>Tell me your demands.
Tell us what we can do.</i>

145
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:51,501
Now...

146
00:49:57,209 --> 00:49:59,042
Come and sit over here!

147
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,876
Sit down here! I know you're afraid.

148
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:10,084
Don't be afraid,
Allah has brought us this far.

149
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:13,626
There's no turning back now.
We have to end this.

150
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:19,876
We've almost made it, there's the city.

151
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:23,751
Almost there...

152
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:28,459
Come and sit with me. Come on!

153
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:31,209
Kinan, is what we're doing right?

154
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:33,959
- Kinan, is this right?
- Yes, it is.

155
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:36,209
Believe me, it is right.

156
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:39,626
Allah knows what's right or wrong.

157
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:41,459
Sit with me.

158
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,917
<i>Please tell us your demands.</i>

159
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:48,251
Come and sit with me, brother.
Why are you frightened?

160
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:53,292
Please don't be afraid. Trust me: this is right.
Now come to me.

161
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:56,167
Trust me. There's no need to be afraid.

162
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:57,751
Just come here!

163
00:50:58,334 --> 00:51:01,834
Almost there.
The whole world is watching us.

164
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:05,251
Look at that! Do you see it?
Come on!

165
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:10,501
Calm down, Vedat.

166
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:13,626
We're almost there. Come sit with me, my brother.

167
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:16,959
Come on!

168
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:19,292
Come and sit with me!

169
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:29,542
No!

170
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,334
I don't want to die!

171
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:34,001
- Kinan, I can't! I can't!
- Yes, you can.

172
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:36,709
I know you can, now come sit with me.

173
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:41,042
I can't! I can't!
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!

174
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:43,459
- Pray with me.
- I don't want to die.

175
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:47,042
I don't want to die! Kinan!

176
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,084
No!

177
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:51,542
Yalla, come on!

178
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:53,751
- I can't! I can't!
- Sit down.

179
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:57,917
- I can't!
- Come to me. You don't need to be afraid anymore.

180
00:51:58,167 --> 00:52:01,251
No! I don't want to die, Kinan!

181
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:03,334
We're almost there.

182
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:08,959
- We're almost there!
- Kinan, I don't want to die.

183
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,251
No!

184
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:16,209
Welcome death, welcome it.
We're almost there.

185
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:34,334
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch me!

186
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:36,167
Don't touch me!

187
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:37,667
Don't touch me!

188
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:40,459
<i>European 162, are you receiving me?</i>

189
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:54,709
<i>European 162, are you receiving me?</i>

190
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,334
<i>European 162, can you hear me?</i>

191
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:08,459
<i>Are you receiving me?
Is anybody there?</i>

192
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,751
<i>Is there anyone in the cockpit
who understands me?</i>

193
00:59:58,501 --> 00:59:59,917
One, two, three.

194
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:30,376
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

195
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:34,167
<i>My name is Alexander Franz.
I'm from the police.</i>

196
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:37,376
<i>I'd like to talk to you.</i>

197
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:41,042
<i>I'd like to help you to get out of this situation.</i>

198
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:47,959
<i>Please answer me.</i>

199
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:57,084
<i>If you answer me, I can help you.
Please go to the radio and answer me.</i>

200
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:07,209
<i>At least give me a sign
that you can hear me.</i>

201
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:12,792
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hello, thank you for answering me.</i>

202
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:17,459
<i>I'm Alexander Franz.
I'm from the police. I'd like to help you.</i>

203
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:20,209
<i>Tell me what I can do for you.</i>

204
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:26,959
- I don't want anyone to come in here.
- <i>I assure you, no one will try to get in.</i>

205
01:06:28,709 --> 01:06:29,917
I have a hostage.

206
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,459
So do what I say.

207
01:06:33,709 --> 01:06:36,501
I want you to refuel this plane. Now!

208
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:39,959
<i>I'd like to do that, but I need time.</i>

209
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:44,584
I want to leave in 20 minutes.
I'm giving you 20 minutes!

210
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:47,501
<i>I'll do everything I can,</i>

211
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:52,001
<i>but I'm going to be honest:
20 minutes isn't enough time...</i>

212
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:54,876
No, 20 minutes! Where's the problem?

213
01:06:56,417 --> 01:07:01,709
<i>It takes time.
We have to order the tanker and fill it up.</i>

214
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:05,834
<i>Then we have to drive it out to you.
That takes time.</i>

215
01:07:06,084 --> 01:07:07,417
<i>Please believe me.</i>

216
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:23,417
<i>Hello? Did you hear what I said?</i>

217
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,751
<i>You have to tell me what happens next.</i>

218
01:07:38,751 --> 01:07:41,834
- You've got half an hour.
- <i>We need more time...</i>

219
01:07:42,084 --> 01:07:44,626
No, I won't give you more time!

220
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:49,876
<i>I'll try, but I don't know
how we'll manage all that in 30 minutes.</i>

221
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:51,334
- Hurry up!
- <i>Talk to me about...</i>

222
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:54,709
I don't want to talk!
I don't want to talk!

223
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:59,542
- <i>I understand...</i>
- I want you to refuel this plane!

224
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:05,209
- <i>That's happening while we 're talking.</i>
- Then hurry up! Hurry up!

225
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:07,792
Or I swear I'll kill him!

226
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:14,167
- 30 minutes!
- <i>Calm down. I can only meet your demands if the pilot remains unharmed.</i>

227
01:08:16,501 --> 01:08:19,792
<i>I really want to get you out of this situation.</i>

228
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:23,751
<i>But that will only happen
if you don't harm the pilot. Okay?</i>

229
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,667
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

230
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:32,542
<i>It's vital
that we continue talking to each other.</i>

231
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:38,709
<i>I'd like to understand what brought you here.
It wasn't your fault, was it?</i>

232
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:43,709
<i>I don't think
you wanted this to happen.</i>

233
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:47,292
<i>I can help you. Maybe...</i>

234
01:15:17,751 --> 01:15:20,751
<i>A passenger plane
on its way from Berlin to Paris</i>

235
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:24,501
<i>is reported to have been hijacked
by Islamist terrorists.</i>

236
01:15:24,876 --> 01:15:28,167
<i>After courageous passengers
overpowered some of the hijackers,</i>

237
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:30,876
<i>the plane made an emergency landing
in Hannover.</i>

238
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:35,751
<i>A police spokesman has confirmed
that one hijacker is still on board the plane,</i>

239
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:38,584
<i>which is why
there is a wide cordon around the airport.</i>

240
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:43,917
<i>Heavily armed special police units are taking up
position. The first curious onlookers have...</i>

241
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:34,667
<i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

242
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,667
<i>This is Alexander Franz again.</i>

243
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:43,084
<i>I'm in the car
that's now approaching the plane.</i>

244
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:47,376
<i>I couldn't reach you by radio
and I want to carry on talking to you.</i>

245
01:16:47,626 --> 01:16:52,251
<i>I want to find a way for you and Tobias
to come out of this unharmed.</i>

246
01:16:57,376 --> 01:17:01,167
<i>I'm getting out of the car
and I'm going to stand below the plane.</i>

247
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:04,459
<i>Could you maybe open the window?</i>

248
01:17:16,334 --> 01:17:21,501
<i>I'm standing below the plane.
Could you open the window?</i>

249
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:35,584
<i>Thank you for opening the window.
How are you now?</i>

250
01:17:37,959 --> 01:17:41,542
- <i>Please come to the window.</i>
- Have you refueled the plane?

251
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:46,376
- <i>Could you speak a little louder...?</i>
- Have you refueled the plane?

252
01:17:46,626 --> 01:17:49,501
<i>The tanker is full and ready to go.</i>

253
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:54,834
<i>But now you've got to do something for me.
Let me have a quick word with the pilot.</i>

254
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:58,709
<i>I want to see that he's okay.
Please bring Tobias to the window.</i>

255
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:03,792
Where's my tanker?

256
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:07,126
<i>Bring Tobias to the window first. Please.</i>

257
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:12,334
- Refuel the plane first!
- <i>But you have to make a tiny concession to me.</i>

258
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:15,584
- Don't shit me!
- <i>I'm really not shitting you!</i>

259
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:19,167
<i>Trust me. I really want to help you.</i>

260
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:23,542
<i>I want you and Tobias
to come out of this unharmed.</i>

261
01:18:24,001 --> 01:18:27,626
- Shut up!
- <i>But you have to give me something. Please.</i>

262
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,876
<i>Bring Tobias to the window.</i>

263
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:36,209
<i>I need to see that he's okay,
that he doesn't need medical assistance.</i>

264
01:18:36,459 --> 01:18:39,917
<i>Please!
Then I'll send you the tanker right away.</i>

265
01:19:02,959 --> 01:19:05,959
<i>Thank you for doing that. That's good.</i>

266
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:09,292
Here he is!

267
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,417
Where's my tanker?

268
01:19:17,584 --> 01:19:22,626
<i>I'm now going to give the sign
for the tanker to approach the plane.</i>

269
01:19:29,876 --> 01:19:31,667
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

270
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:34,626
<i>The tanker is full and good to go.</i>

271
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:40,834
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

272
01:19:50,126 --> 01:19:52,292
<i>Could you answer, please?</i>

273
01:20:00,584 --> 01:20:03,709
<i>Please come back to the window
and talk to me.</i>

274
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:07,626
<i>Otherwise I'll have to stop the tanker.</i>

275
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:21,917
<i>Don't do anything stupid now!</i>

276
01:20:23,001 --> 01:20:25,667
<i>You're worrying me.
Come back to the window.</i>

277
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:35,584
Mom...

278
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,584
I trusted them.

279
01:20:49,251 --> 01:20:50,501
<i>What's wrong?</i>

280
01:20:51,459 --> 01:20:53,334
<i>Why aren't you answering me?</i>

281
01:20:57,459 --> 01:20:59,084
I want to go home, Mom.

282
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:01,376
I want to go home.

283
01:21:05,084 --> 01:21:07,042
I want to get out of here.

284
01:21:12,626 --> 01:21:14,209
<i>Please stop this!</i>

285
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:19,542
<i>Put the knife down,
open the door and come out. Please.</i>

286
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:24,792
<i>I know you didn't want any of this.</i>

287
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:28,834
<i>But you can make it stop now.
Be reasonable.</i>

288
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,001
I'm sorry.

289
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:43,667
<i>Just stop it and come out.
Put down the knife and come out.</i>

290
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:46,209
<i>Then it will be all over.</i>

291
01:22:05,584 --> 01:22:07,167
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

292
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:10,376
<i>Lower the knife immediately!</i>

293
01:22:13,584 --> 01:22:16,126
<i>Lower the knife immediately.</i>

294
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:21,667
<i>Lower the knife!</i>

295
01:22:27,459 --> 01:22:29,584
<i>Lower the knife immediately!</i>

296
01:22:33,376 --> 01:22:37,626
<i>Well done! It's really good
that you're lowering the knife.</i>

297
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:43,626
No! No! No!

298
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,292
No!

299
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:47,709
Where's my tanker?

300
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,001
Don't shit me! Don't shit me!

301
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:57,459
- <i>Lower the knife! Don't hold it to his throat.</i>
- Listen to me! - <i>I am!</i>

302
01:22:57,834 --> 01:23:00,376
If I don't fly out of here
in two minutes, I'll kill him!

303
01:23:00,626 --> 01:23:05,126
- I'll kill him!
- <i>If you threaten him, I can't guarantee your safety!</i>

304
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:09,459
- You're all shitting me!
- <i>Really I'm not.</i>

305
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:15,459
<i>You must believe me. I want to help you,
but please lower the knife.</i>

306
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:22,042
<i>Boy, I'm sure you don't want anything
to happen to the pilot. Lower the knife.</i>

307
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,709
<i>Listen to me! Lower the knife!</i>

308
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:32,042
<i>Or I can't guarantee your safety!</i>

309
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:37,626
<i>Put the knife down immediately.
Come on, put the knife down, please.</i>

310
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:11,834
<i>Police, open the door!</i>

311
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,917
<i>Open the cockpit door!</i>

312
01:24:29,376 --> 01:24:31,834
We're going in! Police! Police!

313
01:24:32,792 --> 01:24:35,042
Four persons, the pilot is still alive.

314
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:38,626
Go! Go!

315
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:41,834
The pilot's coming out!

316
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,376
Hijacker unconscious, bleeding heavily.

317
01:24:53,251 --> 01:24:54,751
I'll bring him out.

318
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,542
Hijacker is coming out!

319
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:01,292
You got him?

320
01:25:04,584 --> 01:25:05,959
I'm going back in.

321
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:09,667
I repeat: I'm going back into the cockpit.

322
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:13,542
Two further persons in the cockpit.

323
01:25:14,084 --> 01:25:15,834
Presumably the captain.

324
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:17,542
He's lifeless.

325
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:19,709
One further male.

326
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:22,209
Also lifeless.

327
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,751
We're coming out now.
