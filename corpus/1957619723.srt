Hi, where's mama?

47
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,047
- Sit down Francis.

48
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,949
- Frannie.

49
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,183
Okay, let me have it.

50
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,018
- Have what Frannie?

51
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,119
- The lecture.

52
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,053
I mean you're mad at me right?

53
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,321
I mean that's why you're in here

00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,923
with whatchamacallit
 it and ignoring me.

55
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,757
- Frannie--

56
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,858
- How's the bank Jake?

57
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,528
Gray on gray, that's exciting.

58
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,032
You know, I bet you never once
 dreamed in technicolor huh?

59
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,099
Mama I'm home!

60
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:20,934
- Frannie!

61
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,904
Mama's gone.

62
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,240
- Gone where?

63
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,142
- She died Frannie.

64
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,711
- She what?

65
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,180
She died?

66
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,183
- She died three days ago.

67
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,619
- We tried to find you Francis,

68
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,054
nobody knew where you were.

69
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,256
- We had no idea how to
get in touch with you.

70
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,427
- But the doctor said she
  had six months to live.

71
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,628
I was there when he said it.

72
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,463
- As much as six months.

73
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,498
He said she had as
 much as, not for sure.

74
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,604
She wanted to see you.

75
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,840
The whole time I was
 taking care of her

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,041
she kept talking about ya.

77
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,042
- I'm sorry.

78
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,279
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,047
- Sorry doesn't
  cut it this time.

80
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,015
- Natalie.

81
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,651
She's had a rough
  couple of months.

82
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,188
- Do you know what it's like

83
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,122
to bathe your own
  mother Frannie?

84
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,460
Her body was so tiny I could
 pick her up in my arms.

85
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,466
- Where is she?

86
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,767
- Every morning she'd
 look out the window

87
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,369
hoping you'd come down the road.

88
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,771
Hoping she'd live long enough

89
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,808
to hear another one
 of your stupid jokes.

90
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,844
Or your latest
  R-rated adventure.

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,348
- Did they close her eyes Nat?

92
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,159
- She's buried Francis.

93
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,929
We had the funeral.

94
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,232
When we couldn't find
 you we had no choice.

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,968
- I missed my own
  mothers funeral.

96
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:04,971
- Where were you?

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,675
- Me?

98
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,377
Oh I was probably up to no good.

99
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,412
You know me Jake.

100
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,421
(solemn music)

101
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,153
Her clothes are in the closet.

102
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,956
- [Nat] I know.

103
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,861
- Look.

104
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,430
- [Nat] What?

105
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,133
- Her hair.

106
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,836
Beautiful hair.

107
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,341
- [Nat] Didn't mean what I said.

108
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,275
- Yes you did.

109
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,644
It's okay.

110
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,615
Did you let daddy know?

111
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,683
- [Nat] Why would I?

112
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,184
I haven't seen him in forever.

113
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,124
- Could I have
  her hairbrush Nat?

114
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,761
- [Nat] Sure.

115
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,598
- Thank you.

116
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,277
Oh Nat, you know
 the night mama died,

117
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,713
I was probably with some guy.

118
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,949
- Don't think about it.

119
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,884
- A jerk.

120
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,952
A real jerk.

121
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,323
You know how you said jerk
  guys were my specialty?

122
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,394
Mama said it was
 time to outgrow 'em.

123
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,732
She wanted me to be settled and

124
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,369
normal.

125
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:18,638
- Good luck.

126
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,749
- Who carried the casket?

127
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,787
- Dave Perkins, Walter Boone,

128
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,455
the cousins.

129
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,425
- Was it really heavy?

130
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,764
- I don't know Frannie.

131
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,333
- Nat.

132
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,171
I think I really
 messed up this time.

133
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:56,843
Didn't I?

134
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,113
(loud sobbing)

135
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,052
I miss her.

136
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,262
Nat.

137
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,096
- [Nat] Uh huh.

138
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,565
- [Frannie] What's it like?

139
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,569
To be so responsible.

140
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,806
I mean do you ever loosen up?

141
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,807
- I like how I am.

142
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,877
She's over there.

143
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,613
- I can't do this.

144
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,417
I can't.

145
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,186
- Yeah you can.

146
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,259
- Did you take a picture
of her afterwards?

147
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,460
- Why would I?

148
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,394
- Just of her face.

149
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,395
Did you?

150
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,596
- Stop it Frannie.

151
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,998
- When we're born
 people take all kinds

152
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,232
of pictures of us.

153
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,368
When you go it's
  as if everybody's

154
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,769
ashamed of you or something.

155
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,571
- Are you coming?

156
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,181
- You think she's alright?

157
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,483
- Did you bring a vase?

158
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,451
- I'm gonna plant them.

159
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,086
- They're gonna die Frannie.

160
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,256
- Well then I brought them
 to the right place, didn't I?

161
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,525
(slow paced music)

162
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,193
I remember musical chairs.

163
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,428
- Why do you keep
 going on like that?

164
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,764
- I'm not asking
 you I'm asking mama.

165
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,731
- You know what,
  I'm gonna go back.

166
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,565
Are you coming?

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,669
- I used to love that game.

168
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,971
Going around and around.

169
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,641
I used to love circles.

170
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,612
I love how things
  go around again.

171
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,494
You get that out
of a cereal box?

172
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,096
- We're storing it in the attic.

173
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,066
- For our future home Francis.

174
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:00,900
- Oh.

175
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,069
- Speaking of the
  future Frannie,

176
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,204
we've been going
over some things

177
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,439
we'd like you to think about.

178
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,441
- Yeah, when are you
 two gonna get married?

179
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,477
You going for a record for the
 world's largest engagement?

180
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,146
- Frannie, this is
  serious, it's about money.

181
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,115
- Oh mama told me about that.

182
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,517
We get $25,000 each.

183
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,453
The house belongs to both of us,

184
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,054
only she left it in your name.

185
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,657
'Cause she knew you'd
 take care of things.

186
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,226
Oh, I'm gonna buy a
 horse with my money.

187
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,328
- That's not a good idea.

188
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,896
- Why not?

189
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,131
- Things might change.

190
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,400
- How?

191
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,568
We have 20 acres.

192
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,171
Okay, my horse won't go
on your half Natalie.

193
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,674
- Frannie, listen.

194
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,210
We've been studying your
finances and yours--

195
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,112
- I don't really
  have any finances.

196
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,047
- Exactly, that's my point.

197
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,848
- What point?

198
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,083
- We, Natalie and I,

199
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,385
we've got long-term goals.

200
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,986
Marriage, family, et cetera.

201
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,456
We've been discussing
 what we think

202
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,458
would be best for
  you and for us.

203
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,896
And we think that we
 should sell the place.

204
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,266
- You can't.

205
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,768
Mama left it for us to live in.

206
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,270
- Natalie will give you
half the money Francis.

207
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,505
- No.

208
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,140
- We figure we'd get a
couple hundred thousand.

209
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,975
- N period O period.

210
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,443
- Frannie--

211
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,577
- She put it in your name 'cause
you're the responsible one.

212
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,812
It's ours Natalie.

213
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,448
Mama wouldn't want this.

214
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,750
- Francis, try to see
 the logic in this.

215
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,052
- Oh I'm not letting
 you sell this place.

216
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,153
Not now, not ever.

217
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,254
I'm not gonna let you.

218
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,890
- Frannie.

219
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,659
Frannie stop, can't
 you ever listen?

220
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,194
- Look, if you don't
 wanna stay here,

221
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,963
if it's not fancy enough
 for you and whatchamajigger,

222
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,598
then leave, I don't care.

223
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,434
- Right, all you care
 about is yourself.

224
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,169
- At least I'm not
 selling our heritage.

225
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,770
- [Nat] Oh please.

226
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,038
- This place was built by hand.

227
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,506
You don't even know
 about the floors.

228
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,975
- Since when are you
 the family historian?

229
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,710
- Narrow pine flooring.

230
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,179
White Oak sub-flooring.

231
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,647
Made from our trees.

232
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,481
- What's she getting at?

233
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,782
- And the quilts.

234
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,218
Quilts made by our great
great grandmothers.

235
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,820
- You can keep the quilts.

236
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,823
- Bit by bit, people like
  you sold off this land.

237
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,492
- You wanna ruin
your life, fine.

238
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,728
But you're not
 gonna destroy mine.

239
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,338
(solemn music)

240
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,689
Hey.

241
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,523
- Hey.

242
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,960
Where's Romeo?

243
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,495
- What do you got against Jake?

244
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,164
He was here for me
 when mama was sick.

245
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,366
He helped me with everything.

246
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,802
- Well I've never been
attracted to sedate men.

247
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,270
- I know honesty
  and responsibility

248
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,173
don't appeal to you Frannie,
 but they appeal to me.

249
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,510
I want a secure life,
can you understand that?

250
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,611
- This place is secure.

251
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,247
It's been in our family
for over 100 years.

252
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,481
You wanna throw it away.

253
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,152
- I want a future,
  I want children.

254
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,953
- Who's stopping you?

255
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,724
- It takes money, college
  educations, medical bills.

256
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,325
- You're not selling this place.

257
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,866
- How much time did you
spend here last year?

258
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,701
Or the year before that?

259
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,670
I think your fellas take
up most of your time.

260
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,604
- I'm different now.

261
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,839
- Right.

262
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,674
- I've been celibate
 for three whole days.

263
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,376
(laughing)

264
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:35,381
I have.

265
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,984
You know, I think I kept
getting into trouble

266
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,121
'cause I knew I could
 always come back here.

267
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,058
- Jake and I will
  have a nice place.

268
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,259
- This is where I wanna be.

269
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,093
This is my home.

270
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,330
I wanna do what
 mama always wanted.

271
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,533
Be responsible, have roots,

272
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,668
get a job.

273
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,937
- Where?

274
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,071
Doing what?

275
00:13:59,071 --> 00:13:59,872
- I don't know.

276
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,841
Maybe you could find me
  something at the factory.

277
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,410
- The factory?

278
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,778
You've been putting
 me down for years

279
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,712
for working there.

280
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,714
Too dull for you, remember?

281
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,517
Too tedious for an exciting,

282
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,186
imaginative person
  such as yourself.

283
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,655
- I have to get
 some money so I can

284
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,623
buy you out Nat.

285
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,460
- You can not be serious.

286
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,728
- I am real serious.

287
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,496
- How do you expect to
get that kind of money?

288
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,498
- I don't know, I'm gonna
  figure something out.

289
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,600
I'm gonna do
 whatever it takes to

290
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,468
keep this farm in the family.

291
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,869
- Frannie, be reasonable.

292
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,905
- I cannot believe
  that you let Jake

293
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,507
talk you into such
 a hair-brained idea!

294
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,575
- He didn't!

295
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,912
We both want this.

296
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,680
- Well then you
 both can forget it.

297
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,554
(slow paced music)

298
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,797
(loud horn whistling)

299
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,968
- You're gonna be late.

300
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,236
- Okay.

301
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,972
Gee, what did they
  do to the windows?

302
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,983
Hey, how come you got windows
 and the factory didn't?

303
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,385
I bet people spent too much time

304
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,887
looking out the window
 dreaming they had a life huh?

305
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,923
It's probably more
 efficient windowless.

306
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,695
- So you want to become
a part of our family.

307
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,163
- Yes sir I do.

308
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,998
- Your sister's a
 wonderful employee.

309
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,467
If I recall, she went to college

310
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,036
and you didn't, is that right?

311
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,437
- [Frannie] Yes sir.

312
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,172
She went to Piedmont community
 college for two years.

313
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,708
She had to stop when
our mom first got sick.

314
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,610
If you want the absolute truth,

315
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,978
I didn't like school.

316
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,579
I wasn't school material.

317
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,419
- You don't have
 experience in the type

318
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,920
of production we do here.

319
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,355
- No but I learn fast.

320
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,557
When I learned to ride a
 bike, I got it the first time.

321
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,092
Same with water-skis.

322
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,327
Well actually,
 that took me a day,

323
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,961
but most people
  don't ever get up.

324
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,463
Definitely not the first day.

325
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,566
- Do you know what we do here?

326
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,034
- Sort of.

327
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,402
- We package.

328
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,138
Sew and fold certain products.

329
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,575
- Men's underwear.

330
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,910
Cotton and silk.

331
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,182
- Tell me about
 your job experience.

332
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,720
- Photocopy centers,
 two restaurants,

333
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,721
and an old age home.

334
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,756
I only lasted two days.

335
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,791
The smell got to me.

336
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,493
But I'm more reliable now.

337
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,296
Then there was the
  courier service.

338
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,865
I drove around a lot
 delivering stuff.

339
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,166
Packages and stuff.

340
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,601
I mean it could
 have been anything.

341
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,636
For all I know I could
 have been delivering drugs.

342
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,138
But I wasn't.

343
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:46,972
Are you okay?

344
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,243
- I have a little
  bit of headache.

345
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,245
- Oh you should probably
take the day off.

346
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,281
- It's been very nice
 meeting you Francis.

347
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,317
I hope you'll be
very happy here.

348
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,151
- Oh I got the job?

349
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,486
- Yes.

350
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,987
- Don't you want
  me to take a test?

351
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,288
- Well Natalie will
 be here shortly.

352
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,556
She'll show you around.

353
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,691
- I'll be very happy
 to take a drug test.

354
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,892
- That's not necessary Francis.

355
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,394
- A lie detector test?

356
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,162
- No, if you just take a
  seat in the outer office--

357
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,263
- You know what,
 I've always wanted to

358
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,531
take a lie detector test.

359
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,266
I actually thought
  that would be fun.

360
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,801
I wanna thank you so so much.

361
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,702
I won't let you down.

362
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,170
I'll do a fantastic job.

363
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,772
You won't be sorry.

364
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,942
- I've hired a maniac.

365
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,582
(faint clanking)

366
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,231
- Do you see those women?

367
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,100
They're sewing
 labels into garments.

368
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,035
They get credit for
 the number they do.

369
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,653
You can pack or sew labels.

370
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,421
- It's easy, who makes the most?

371
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,989
- Depends on how fast you go.

372
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,991
It's pay by the piece.

373
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,960
- I'll pack, I'll
  be a great packer.

374
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,996
- [Nat] You can start
 now if you want.

375
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,465
- Well that sounds thrilling.

376
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,401
- Why don't you take
 the middle position.

377
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,235
- Terrific.

378
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,016
- You're not gonna start
in are you Frannie?

379
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,085
- I'm not doing anything.

380
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,826
- [Narrator] Here ya go.

381
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,237
- They're big.

382
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,972
- I did this as a favor to you.

383
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,641
- I appreciate that Mr. Osteen.

384
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,612
- You found her
 something downstairs?

385
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,447
- I did sir.

386
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,549
- She's not really
suited for office work.

387
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,584
- I know.

388
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,785
- Well she's probably
 not even suited

389
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,387
for factory work either.

390
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,221
- No sir.

391
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,258
- Just keep an eye.

392
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:20,993
- I will sir.

393
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,998
- How long do you think
 she'll be staying on with us?

394
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,199
- Not long.

395
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,568
Frannie doesn't
 stick to things much.

396
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,003
- Good.

397
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,837
Good.

398
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,806
You got a couple of
 aspirin out there?

399
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,342
- I'll see what I can do sir.

400
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,552
- How's the kid?

401
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,786
- Don't ask.

402
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:48,921
He was up all night.

403
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,355
Heat rash.

404
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,291
- Baking soda, will
 clear him right up.

405
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,627
- Whew, it's like
  an oven in here.

406
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,465
- I always heard she was
 hot stuff, didn't you Grace?

407
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,734
(laughing)

408
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,340
- It's probably better I don't
 hit someone my first day.

409
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,147
- Frannie, why
 you've been hiding?

410
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,449
- 'Cause I didn't wanna
see people like you.

411
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,650
(chuckling)

412
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,285
- Frannie back in town.

413
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,087
Owe!

414
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,624
- Looks like the boys
 are glad she's back.

415
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,126
(perky music)

416
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,398
- Stupid idiot machine!

417
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,667
(clanking)

418
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,573
I can do it.

419
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,874
Yes I can do it.

420
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,710
I can do it.

421
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,633
What's a good count
 for an average day?

422
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,967
- About 1,000.

423
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,235
- 1,000?

424
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,237
How much do you make for that?

425
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,538
- $60.

426
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,940
- $60, oh my god.

427
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,949
- No snacks, except at break,

428
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,751
and no eating on the line!

429
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,585
- Sorry.

430
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,621
Why didn't y'all tell me?

431
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,124
- You didn't ask.

432
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,526
- Thanks.

433
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,463
I got mixed up on my cardboard.

434
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,634
- [Narrator] One up!

435
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,435
Yes.

436
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:48,907
- Skirt tight enough?

437
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,075
- I had that on earlier.

438
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,277
- Baby!

439
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,245
- Hey, you sit
 right here Frannie!

440
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,413
- Drop dead.

441
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,381
(laughing)

442
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,017
(train honking)

443
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,107
Oh, I didn't see you.

444
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,576
- [Male] I know.

445
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,344
- Is it okay to be here?

446
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,179
- [Male] Yup.

447
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,548
- I don't know the rules.

448
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,720
- This is fine.

449
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,490
- [Frannie] How long
 have you been here?

450
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,525
- Oh not too long.

451
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,993
10 minutes.

452
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,463
Don't mind me, go ahead,
take a nap if you want.

453
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,297
- Thanks.

454
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,968
What do you do here?

455
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,004
- I'm the foreman.

456
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,839
- The foreman?

457
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,143
Oh, is it okay for
  you to talk to me?

458
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:58,944
I just pack.

459
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,612
I'm a packer.

460
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:05,650
- I'm Ruben.

461
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,986
- I'm Frannie.

462
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:08,820
- I know.

463
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,089
- Oh.

464
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,691
Yeah, everybody's
  heard about me.

465
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,931
- Well, the first day's
always the toughest.

466
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,602
Most of 'em quit
 after the first week.

467
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:24,836
If you can get past that,

468
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:27,973
it gets easier.

469
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,778
Hang in there Frannie.

470
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,147
- Thanks.

471
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,259
- [Nat] Congratulations.

472
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,027
- [Frannie] On what?

473
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,996
- Lasting a day.

474
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,198
- I ache all over.

475
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,766
I made $15.

476
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,769
I wish mama was here.

477
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,207
She'd say, "I'm so proud of
 you Frannie, you didn't quit."

478
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,911
You think she can see us Nat?

479
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,614
Maybe she was looking
 down at the factory

480
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,082
and she saw me working.

481
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,286
- I was proud of you Frannie.

482
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,856
- I bought us
 chicken for supper.

483
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,292
- Thanks.

484
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,027
- You remember
 daddy loved chicken?

485
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,499
You ever wonder where he is?

486
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,467
- Not really.

487
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,572
- I ate most of it.

488
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,874
There's two wings
  and a thigh left,

489
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,242
but I couldn't stop myself.

490
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,078
- It's okay.

491
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:40,912
- Who's Ruben?

492
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,682
- Ruben Mason?

493
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,583
- I don't know.

494
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,485
- The one at the mill?

495
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,986
- Yeah, who is he?

496
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,056
- He's nice, solid.

497
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,458
- Too bad.

498
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,727
- Dependable like Jake.

499
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,229
- How sad.

500
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,764
- Did he ask you out?

501
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,199
- No, he's spying on me.

502
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,170
- If he asks you out say yes.

503
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,205
- Another Jake.

504
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,039
(laughing)

505
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,074
No thanks.

506
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,388
Today I'm gonna
 make more than $15.

507
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,726
- Jake and I spoke to the
  realtor about the house.

508
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,527
- I don't wanna hear it.

509
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,130
(upbeat music)

510
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,348
- Is he ever gonna fix
 this blasted thing?

511
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,182
- Dream on baby.

512
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,654
- How long til break?

513
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,454
- 15 minutes.

514
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,323
- I'm dying.

515
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,225
Ethel!

516
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,694
Where is she?

517
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,063
- Ethel's probably in
 the bathroom herself.

518
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:05,997
- I gotta go.

519
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:06,965
- They'll dock you.

520
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:07,866
- Stupid rule.

521
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,312
Oh god!

522
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,713
My ring is caught!

523
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,048
- Get someone to turn it off!

524
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:23,982
Go get someone!

525
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,250
Go!

526
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,255
- [Grace] Help, we
 need some help here!

527
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,025
- Don't you walk away from me!

528
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:34,859
- Report me!

529
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,794
- I will!

530
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:36,995
- The machines are antiquated!

531
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,196
- There's nothing wrong
with our equipment!

532
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,698
- Nothing wrong
 with the equipment!

533
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,499
Bernie's got six, seven, and
 nine are all making metal!

534
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,734
They're worn out!

535
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,102
- Well we can't
  afford to fix 'em!

536
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,038
- Oh well that's it then.

537
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,773
That's the bottom line,
it's about the money.

538
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,675
- If the workers just used
  the machine properly--

539
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,843
- It's not about workers,
  it's about greed!

540
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,311
It's cheaper to patch
 up the employees

541
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,646
than it is to
 modernize the mill!

542
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,248
- Ruben, if you will
 just draft a report,

543
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,750
we'll fix it all.

544
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,251
- You're not gonna
  do a damn thing.

545
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,520
There's a dozen of my reports
 on your desk right now!

546
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,757
You want something more
  efficient, take this down.

547
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,158
This place is a danger zone.

548
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,000
- [Osteen] What do you
  think you're listening in!

549
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,640
- [Jake] How's
  she doing at work?

550
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,575
- Fine.

551
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,876
She hasn't really been herself.

552
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,146
She hasn't even been going out.

553
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,849
- That's an
 improvement isn't it?

554
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,185
I thought that's
what you wanted.

555
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,321
- I think it's the house.

556
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,356
She's clinging to it.

557
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,026
- She'll get over it.

558
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,229
- Not so sure.

559
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,464
She's pretty determined.

560
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,875
- Two more minutes.

561
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,811
Hello.

562
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,845
Frannie you there?

563
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,914
- Is this the underwear map?

564
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,784
- Well we distribute
 to all the red dots.

565
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,452
- That's the whole state plus.

566
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,897
- You did what?

567
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,331
- I put these cards
 in the underwear

568
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,367
asking anyone if anybody
knew where daddy was.

569
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,636
And I told them to call me.

570
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,970
Brilliant?

571
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,540
- How dare you
  jeopardize your job and--

572
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,474
- I don't care about my job.

573
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,009
- Well I care about mine.

574
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,245
You cannot use the factory
  as a detective agency.

575
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,414
- When I find daddy,
 he's gonna be so--

576
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,950
- Forget about him,
 he forgot about us.

577
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,919
- No he hasn't.

578
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,122
I'm planting sage.

579
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,824
I bet daddy loves fresh herbs.

580
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,461
- He never struck
 me as the herb type.

581
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:53,098
- Everything's
 gonna work out Nat.

582
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,299
You'll see.

583
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,401
- This is gonna blow
 up in your face.

584
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,536
Like everything, every
  idiotic plan you ever had.

585
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,804
Another Frannie bomb.

586
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,373
- Daddy cried the
  night he left us.

587
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,274
Did you know that?

588
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,045
When I talked to him,
 his voice was all,

589
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,214
broken.

590
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,984
- You're making that up.

591
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,285
- No I'm not.

592
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,788
I bet he still cries about us.

593
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,257
- Frannie, you know we
have to sell this place.

594
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,692
Jake says the taxes alone--

595
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,594
- Tell Jake to keep
 his nose out of this.

596
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,463
- The yearly taxes are $4,600!

597
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,798
- I'm getting a second job.

598
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,267
I've saved already $200.

599
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,768
Plus the money that mama left.

600
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,906
Don't worry, it's under control.

601
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,408
- If you expect me and Jake
 to sit around for 50 years--

602
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,776
- Yeah who is Jake anyway?

603
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,745
Jake, some little bank clerk

604
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,014
that works in a little
 bank in the mall.

605
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,382
That doesn't give
 him the right to make

606
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,617
decisions for us.

607
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,719
- And you have no right
to forfeit our future.

608
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,423
- I told you I'd
 take care of things.

609
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,393
- I'm the one who takes
care of things Frannie.

610
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,628
"Natalie will do it."

611
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,862
That's all I ever heard.

612
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,464
Nobody ever asked
 you to do anything.

613
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,433
All you had to do was be
beautiful and make people laugh.

614
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,603
- Well when you're
  not the smart one

615
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,438
sometimes you end
 up being the clown.

616
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,845
Ew, it's bitter.

617
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,113
I thought sage was sweet?

618
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,117
How come everything's
 different now?

619
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,121
- We put the place on
 the market Frannie.

620
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:26,758
- God.

621
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,694
I like the way
  things used to be.

622
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,299
I used to be
 somebody's daughter.

623
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,468
I'm not anybody's daughter now.

624
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,706
Who am I now Nat?

625
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,052
You know what the problem is?

626
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,687
We don't have fun anymore.

627
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,988
Let's go to the fair.

628
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,456
Mama would want us to.

629
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,491
She loved fairs.

630
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:05,430
(slow paced music)
 (indistinct chatter)

631
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,849
I hope they have the pig races.

632
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,985
And the biggest hog contest.

633
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,319
Can we stay til
 night so we can have

634
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,754
corn in the cob and ribs?

635
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,324
Big hogs don't
 make good barbecue.

636
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,459
Did you know that Jake?

637
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,594
I always thought it was odd

638
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,795
because the only
 thing that they can be

639
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,566
is like lard or sausage.

640
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,967
I always thought
the prize should

641
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,535
go to the tastiest hog.

642
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,570
- I'm sorry, but
  I just never knew

643
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,673
you know so much
about livestock.

644
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,542
- A lot of things
  you don't know.

645
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,944
- You wanna bite?

646
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,714
Sweet huh?

647
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,449
- Not as sweet as you.

648
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,752
- [Narrator] Alright,
 come on in now!

649
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,153
- Frannie.

650
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:02,987
- Get you one of these little

651
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:03,821
porkers in one minute

652
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:04,656
and you win $200!

653
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,125
- $200?
  - Frannie.

654
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,093
- [Frannie] $200.

655
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,194
- You're out of your mind.

656
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,296
- I need the money.

657
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,230
- You can't catch a pig.

658
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,197
- Yeah, just watch me.

659
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,532
- [Narrator] Now who's next!

660
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,167
- Me, I'm next.

661
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,235
- Come on in here now.

662
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,540
That sure is a short
  skirt for pig scrambling.

663
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,275
(laughing)

664
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,311
- Ah piggies, hi, hi, hi.

665
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,346
Hey, I don't like bacon okay.

666
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,847
- Come on young
  lady, we ain't got

667
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,817
time for y'all to
develop a relationship!

668
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:33,951
(laughing)

669
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,453
- Be nice, I'm
 really a nice person.

670
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,190
- Alright shorty, set
 'em up in there now.

671
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,826
- Okay, I'm ready.

672
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,394
- Let 'em go shorty!

673
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,564
(fast paced music)
  (squealing)

674
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,299
She's got one minute!

675
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,468
- [Frannie] Come here!

676
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,436
Hey hey hey!

677
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,675
Stop!

678
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,977
(squealing)

679
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:17,528
- Lookout now!

680
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:29,640
- Come on!

681
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,512
- She's done it!

682
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,980
- Yes!

683
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,150
- She gave us old men
  some sweet dreams to boot!

684
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,084
- Take me home.

685
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,486
- Congratulations young lady.

686
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,320
- Thank you.

687
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,223
- Disgusting.

688
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,058
- Well, you sure made a fool
 out of yourself Francis.

689
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,259
- Oh you make a
 fool out of yourself

690
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,161
every time you open
 your mouth Jake.

691
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,766
- Don't you ever talk
to Jake like that again.

692
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:05,843
- Hi piggies, I bet you
 guys could get a farm going.

693
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,078
Hi.

694
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,579
- [Narrator] Hi.

695
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,214
- How much would one cost?

696
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,917
- $75.

697
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,218
Feeder pigs are high now.

698
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,688
- Would you sell
  me three for 200?

699
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,591
- Cut the price?

700
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,426
Oh I don't know.

701
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,428
- Cash.

702
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,365
- Oh, cash.

703
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,933
That's different.

704
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,668
Pick out any three you
  want, back your truck up,

705
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,503
and you'll be in the
 pig farming business.

706
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,071
- My truck?

707
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,076
- Can't be a pig farmer
without a truck honey.

708
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,245
- Don't worry, I'm a pig farmer.

709
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,347
I am very definitely
 a pig farmer.

710
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,421
Do pigs nap this time of day?

711
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,523
- Well they sleep on
 and off all the time.

712
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,292
Why?

713
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:56,961
- Well I was thinking
 I could put them

714
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,396
in my car while
  they're sleeping.

715
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,264
- Oh I don't think so.

716
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,732
- Or my trunk.

717
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,835
I could leave it open a
 little so they can breathe.

718
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,136
- They're your pigs.

719
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,705
(squealing)

720
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,506
- Thank you.

721
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:14,645
(perky music)
 (squealing)

722
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,365
(loud ripping)

723
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,105
What the?

724
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,773
Oh no, you can't.

725
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:43,608
Oh no.

726
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,547
Now you go back.

727
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,515
Oh no, no, no.

728
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,884
(screaming)

729
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:53,718
Back in the trunk.

730
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,486
Come on piggy, piggy.

731
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,856
Oh no, no, no.

732
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,091
Oh no no no no.

733
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,460
Oh oh.

734
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,533
Go back to the trunk with
  your friends, come on.

735
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,034
Take your friends back.

736
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,135
That's it!

737
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,038
(tires screeching)

738
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,348
Oh no, no!

739
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,517
No, go back!

740
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,351
No.

741
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,921
Can you go back.

742
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,956
Come on, go back.

743
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,225
Come on little piggy, go
back with your friends.

744
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,816
- What's going on?

745
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,418
- Help me stuff
  'em in the trunk.

746
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,424
- What are you doing
 with those pigs?

747
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,925
- I'm gonna start a pig farm.

748
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,529
Then I can pay you your
  share of the place, okay?

749
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,763
- What, what did she say?

750
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:13,798
- This is none of
 your business Jake.

751
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,167
- Take those things back.

752
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,069
- I can't.

753
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,570
- [Nat] Why not?

754
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,005
- We bonded.

755
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,807
- I happen to know for a
 fact the county frowns upon--

756
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,408
- Screw your facts Jake!

757
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,110
They're my pigs, they're
going back to my place.

758
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,412
- Then you can figure out
  how to get them there.

759
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,550
(slow quirky music)

760
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,081
- Recognized your car.

761
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,216
- You did?

762
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,785
- Yeah, it's unique.

763
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,226
Looks like you could
use a little help there.

764
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,994
Why don't I give 'em a lift.

765
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,596
- Oh I'd really appreciate that.

766
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,702
- Hey, you still got those pens?

767
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,536
- Yeah.

768
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,074
We got us a ride piggies.

769
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,046
Be careful.

770
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,984
- How'd you know
 where everything was?

771
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,918
The pig pen and everything.

772
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,186
- Well I've been here before.

773
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,088
- You have?

774
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:44,922
When?

775
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,357
I don't remember.

776
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,225
I don't even remember
 hearing anything about you.

777
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,194
- Well it was a long time ago.

778
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,263
We used to buy eggs
 from your granddaddy.

779
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:55,633
Come out here with my father
 on a Sunday afternoon.

780
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,134
Sometimes we'd buy a chicken.

781
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,504
Thanksgiving we'd come
  and get us a fresh turkey.

782
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,274
- What did my grandpa look like?

783
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,108
- Your grandpa?

784
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,778
Well let's see, he was tall.

785
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,848
About my height, leaner.

786
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,784
And he was tan, he was always
 tan, even in the winter.

787
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,019
And he had big hands.

788
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,288
Big knotty looking
 hands, strong hands.

789
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,024
- What color were his eyes?

790
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,727
- You don't believe me do ya?

791
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,561
- What color?

792
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,130
- Same color as your eyes.

793
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:29,834
Except he wore glasses.

794
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,738
Now I'll tell you something
 that you didn't know.

795
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,272
My mom and your
 grandma were friends.

796
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,440
Did you know that?

797
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,508
- No.

798
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,542
- Her eyes were blue.

799
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,049
- Well, I'd invite
  you in for coffee

800
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,918
but my sisters a
  little mad at me.

801
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,186
- It's alright.

802
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,394
- Anyway.

803
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,029
- Anyway.

804
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,501
Yeah, it's a fine
  old place alright.

805
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,569
- Yeah it is.

806
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,371
- I don't know, it's
just something about it.

807
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,205
It seems like,

808
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,875
home.

809
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,080
Sorry about your
 mama passing Frannie.

810
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,248
- Thank you Ruben.

811
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,118
- Hey you know, I
 remembered something

812
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,486
else about your granddaddy.

813
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,925
He was very serious and good.

814
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,960
He was a good person, like you.

815
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:31,929
- Me, good?

816
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,898
No I'm not.

817
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,100
No I'm good, but I'm a mess.

818
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,335
I mean if you knew
 me, if you really knew

819
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,437
you'd run.

820
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,740
- Frannie.

821
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,808
- Where have you been anyway?

822
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,643
I mean everybody knows how I am.

823
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,644
- Everybody's wrong.

824
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,448
Maybe sometime,

825
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,088
well maybe I can take a rain
 check on that coffee huh?

826
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,156
- I can't.

827
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,624
Sorry, I'm sorry.

828
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,043
Natalie!

829
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,632
- So Sheriff says, "Charlie
 you'll be gone on parole.

830
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,900
"Is there a problem?"

831
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,701
He says, "Yeah I'm
  drunk you fool."

832
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,074
- [Narrator] Hey Frannie.

833
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,976
- Hi, long time no see.

834
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,345
- Hey.

835
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,145
- Hey.

836
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,114
- How 'bout a drink?

837
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,850
- Do I know you?

838
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,618
- Not yet.

839
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,721
- I feel like I've had amnesia

840
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,989
and I'm just waking up.

841
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,727
What'd you say your name was?

842
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,362
- Ted.

843
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,763
Ted Bass.

844
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:16,333
- You know what Ted,
 being good gets old.

845
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,804
- Yeah you gotta cut loose
  every once in a while.

846
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,639
- Yeah.

847
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,709
- Wanna dance?
  (slow paced music)

848
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,044
- Yeah.

849
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:27,945
- Let's go.

850
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,386
- Did you hear the one
 about the pet duck?

851
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,587
- No.

852
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,023
- A man took his pet
duck into a feed store,

853
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,791
buy him some stuff.

854
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,994
The man who owned the feed
 store said "Cash or charge?"

855
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,464
The man who owned the duck
 said, "Put it on his bill."

856
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,366
(chuckling)

857
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,634
Get it?

858
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,435
Duck bill?

859
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,206
Did you hear the one about

860
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,710
the man whose wife was sick?

861
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,845
- Are you hungry?

862
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,113
- Am I talking too much?

863
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,684
My mama just died.

864
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,019
Did I say that already?

865
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,057
Hey, we're supposed
 to be having fun.

866
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,461
- Come on.

867
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,629
- Where?

868
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,463
- Outside.

869
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,633
- Okay handsome.

870
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:25,469
I like to laugh.

871
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,639
That's why I tell
 the jokes, you know?

872
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,847
No really, don't.

873
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,382
Wait a minute.

874
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,650
Stop okay!

875
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,484
Stop it!

876
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,055
Stop it!

877
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,292
- What are you?

878
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,426
A tease?

879
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,661
Everybody knows you.

880
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,263
You're Frannie the
  good time girl.

881
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,732
- Why don't you go
 back inside and tell

882
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,667
everybody the good
  times are over.

883
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,651
(tires screeching)

884
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,529
- So how are your pigs?

885
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,830
- Fine.

886
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,432
- You sure about that?

887
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,933
- Yeah why?

888
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,235
- I don't know, you look--

889
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,071
- What, rotten?

890
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:34,905
- Worried.

891
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:37,875
- I went out last night.

892
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,811
- That's nice.

893
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,645
- No it's not.

894
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,783
I didn't even invite you
  in for a glass for water.

895
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,985
And then I go and do something.

896
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:48,986
I'm a mess.

897
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,426
- Well we could sure
 use some rain huh?

898
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,960
- Rain makes me sleepy.

899
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,961
Storms are better.

900
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,698
(laughing)

901
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,300
What?

902
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,202
- Nothing, you make me laugh.

903
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,739
- That's me, the joker.

904
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:09,973
- I heard that about you.

905
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,776
- I picked up another
 jerk last night.

906
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:13,877
Did you hear that too?

907
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:15,979
- No.

908
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,016
- Well I felt I should tell you.

909
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,986
- You don't owe me
  anything Frannie.

910
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,725
- Maybe he wasn't a
 jerk, maybe I was.

911
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,727
Anyway, nothing happened.

912
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,930
Surprised him.

913
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,399
Surprised me too.

914
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,437
We're almost friends huh?

915
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:43,941
- Almost.

916
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,678
- It's strange.

917
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,580
- What is?

918
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,684
- Most guys would've
been all over me by now.

919
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,157
- Since you like jokes,

920
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,994
I made up a joke okay.

921
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:04,795
Knock knock.

922
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,867
Knock knock.

923
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:10,834
- Oh, who's there?

924
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,304
- Do we.

925
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,405
- [Frannie] Do we who?

926
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,510
- Do we wanna have
  lunch together.

927
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,378
(laughing)

928
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,212
- Ruben.

929
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,814
That's so sad.

930
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,516
- Well it's my first joke.

931
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,851
(laughing)

932
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,520
- It's really bad, do we.

933
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:31,722
- Well?

934
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,161
- Now?

935
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,696
- It is lunchtime yeah.

936
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,132
- Out in public?

937
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,369
- I think that's what
 friends do, yeah.

938
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,306
- Well yeah, I guess.

939
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,507
I mean how would I know?

940
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,412
Did you hear the one about
  this lady and her geese?

941
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,114
There was this
  knock-kneed lady--

942
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,382
(laughing)

943
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,050
Wait, Ruben, wait
  for the punchline.

944
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,620
Okay, so she takes
 him out for a walk.

945
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,589
- You're gonna land us in jail.

946
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,658
You and your ridiculous schemes.

947
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,526
- What did I do?

948
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,461
- You might have lost
 me my job Frannie.

949
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,263
I knew this would
  happen, I knew it.

950
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,534
(light knocking)

951
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,438
- I'm not (speaks too low).

952
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,307
- [Frannie] I know.

953
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,911
- That's your name is it not?

954
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,647
And your address?

955
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,017
- Yes sir.

956
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,819
- Well a customer called us.

957
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,322
She found that card in a
  package of our underwear.

958
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,627
Now according to that
  card, you're looking for?

959
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,595
- My father.

960
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,330
- You're fired Ms. Vaughn.

961
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,464
- Oh I can't be.

962
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:48,966
Really, I can explain.

963
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,602
See, when my mama died, I
  didn't have anyone left.

964
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,536
I mean nobody.

965
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,004
Sure I have Natalie my sister,

966
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,038
but she has Jake.

967
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,976
Anyway, I just knew
 if I could find

968
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,211
my father I could be
  somebody's daughter again.

969
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,414
So when I saw the
  map I figured--

970
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,249
- Ms. Vaughn.

971
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,518
- Please?

972
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:15,092
(slow paced music)

973
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,861
- You're killing me Frannie.

974
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,163
- I'm only suspended Natalie.

975
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,132
Mr. Osteen said I could
come back in two weeks.

976
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,800
- Look at you, you
  and that damn pig.

977
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,669
She thinks she's a dog.

978
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,237
I'm sick of worrying about you.

979
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,206
- Do you wanna hit me?

980
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,642
Make you feel better.

981
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,709
Come on, go ahead.

982
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:33,543
Hit me in the head.

983
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,378
Hit me hard.

984
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,412
- Don't be ridiculous.

985
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,117
Tempting.

986
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,786
- Nat, I love you.

987
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,364
Did you know Ruben used to
  come here a long time ago?

988
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,599
- Mm hmm.

989
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,833
- Really?

990
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,068
Well where was I anyway?

991
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,805
- You're never gonna
 slaughter her are ya?

992
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,476
- Alice, are you kidding?

993
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,011
I love her like a sister.

994
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,313
- So much for pig farming.

995
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,991
(ringing)

996
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,100
- Hello.

997
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,502
- [Narrator] Are you the person
looking for Frank Vaughn?

998
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,005
- Nat!

999
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,707
I found him, I found daddy!

1000
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:42,412
Hello, yes I am the person
  looking for Frank Vaughn.

1001
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,415
(slow quirky music)

1002
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,264
- Francis?

1003
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,134
Violet Vaughn.

1004
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,774
So,

1005
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,777
I'm his third wife.

1006
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,379
I thought I was his second wife.

1007
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,883
He never mentioned
  a wife over in--

1008
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:20,917
- Silk Hope.

1009
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,786
It's about 200 miles from here.

1010
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,590
- He never mentioned
 any children either.

1011
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,824
There's two of ya?

1012
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:28,658
- Yes ma'am.

1013
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,261
- That's Frank alright.

1014
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,065
A lot of things he
  never mentioned.

1015
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,566
Like why he couldn't
 hold down a job

1016
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,402
for more than six
  months at a time.

1017
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,536
- I get that from him.

1018
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,340
- And why he couldn't go a
  single day without liquor.

1019
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,712
- I guess you called
  because you found my note.

1020
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,480
- My son found it.

1021
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,249
In a brand new
 package of underwear.

1022
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,852
You don't ignore a note in
  a pair of men's underwear.

1023
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,188
- Sorry.

1024
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,627
- Did you love your daddy?

1025
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,297
So did I.

1026
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,400
A long long time ago.

1027
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,670
- Do you know
 where my father is?

1028
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:15,872
- Honey,

1029
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,845
everybody knows where
 Frank Vaughn is.

1030
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,854
(slow paced music)

1031
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:54,845
- Hi.

1032
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,348
Do you know a man
 named Frank Vaughn?

1033
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,483
- Are you kidding?

1034
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,384
He practically
qualifies as a resident.

1035
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,624
I'll tell him you're
 looking for him.

1036
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,728
Frank, you got a
woman at the end

1037
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,131
of the bar who
 wants to talk to ya.

1038
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,241
She was there.

1039
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,279
(slow paced music)

1040
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,306
(faint thundering)

1041
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,408
- All my life all
  I dreamed about

1042
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,545
is how great it would be
to see my daddy again.

1043
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,983
I couldn't wait
  for him to hug me

1044
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,019
and tell me how
  much he loved me.

1045
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,858
And when I found
him, I just ran.

1046
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,327
- I'm sorry Fran.

1047
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:19,729
- He's just a drunk.

1048
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:21,898
- I know.

1049
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,601
- How do you know?

1050
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,535
- Mama told me.

1051
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,038
He treated you like a China doll

1052
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,606
but he made her life miserable.

1053
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,741
- Why didn't she tell me?

1054
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,843
- You were never here.

1055
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,048
He was a rotten husband Frannie.

1056
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,154
- Why didn't anyone tell me?

1057
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,724
- [Nat] Or is that
  just your hair?

1058
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,558
Bonnet.

1059
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,359
- It is?

1060
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,127
It is.

1061
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:54,864
Look here.

1062
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:56,800
Who is this?

1063
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,204
- I think that's great
 great grandma Delia.

1064
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,373
- I wonder what she was like.

1065
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,041
- Nobody ever talked about her.

1066
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,610
- Why?

1067
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,712
- I don't know, some
 sort of family secret.

1068
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:14,017
- She looks like this
 blissful kind of free spirit.

1069
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,256
- She looks a little like you.

1070
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,229
- Oh.

1071
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,734
I wonder why everybody wanted
 to keep you a secret Delia?

1072
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,343
- [Narrator] It's my fine point.

1073
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,177
- I see, I see.

1074
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,648
- Come on kids.

1075
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,983
(squealing)

1076
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,819
Oh don't worry, they're tamed.

1077
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,521
This is Alice's favorite room.

1078
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,395
Oh good, you're here.

1079
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,197
I was just about to tell
 them about our pet termites.

1080
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,533
(squealing)

1081
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,479
Well, aren't they cute?

1082
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,654
Where are you going?

1083
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,091
- As far away from
  you as I can get.

1084
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,359
- Why?

1085
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,927
- I'll be staying with
 Jake and his parents.

1086
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,262
- You're leaving me alone?

1087
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,763
Why?

1088
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,433
- Because I'm sick of you and
 your irresponsible behavior.

1089
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,201
Because I want a decent
life with a husband

1090
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,669
and a home of my own.

1091
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,504
Because I want some peace,

1092
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,174
which is something you
 will never comprehend.

1093
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,442
And if you think
your little show

1094
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,744
managed to stop anything
you're mistaken.

1095
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,212
Those people had no
 interest in the house,

1096
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,647
it's the property they want.

1097
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,819
(slow paced music)

1098
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,692
- We're alone now Alice.

1099
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,195
It's a bad day.

1100
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,398
Yeah, it's a real bad day.

1101
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,700
It's a lost day.

1102
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,403
It's a lost sister day.

1103
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,208
Oh my, it's not a
 good day at all is it?

1104
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,419
- Just think, this
  time next year

1105
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,820
we're gonna be married,

1106
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,222
be sitting at our own table.

1107
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,258
- Will we ever afford it Jake?

1108
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,193
- Oh yeah, once we sell
that house of yours.

1109
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:40,897
Natalie?

1110
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,566
- Sorry.

1111
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,137
- You're still
 worried about Francis?

1112
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,839
She's gonna end up like mama.

1113
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,510
Alone, dumped by some drunk.

1114
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,412
- She'll always have us.

1115
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,415
- We're gonna have
 to take care of her.

1116
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,320
- We already do.

1117
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,827
(clanking)

1118
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,848
(screaming)

1119
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,082
- Somebody!

1120
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,918
Somebody help me please!

1121
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:35,752
Help me!

1122
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,153
- Shut down four!

1123
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,289
- Help help me please!

1124
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,123
My arm!

1125
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,758
- Turn off four!

1126
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:42,592
- Help me!

1127
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:46,696
- [Narrator] What's happening!

1128
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,965
(grunting)

1129
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,136
- Somebody turn it off!

1130
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,404
(loud ringing)

1131
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,738
Somebody please!

1132
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,508
- Get somebody on it!

1133
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,387
- Quick, tell me a joke.

1134
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:14,290
- Okay.

1135
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,462
I can't think of a punchline.

1136
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:24,701
- Get him!

1137
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,105
- [Narrator] One, two, three!

1138
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,106
- I'm going.

1139
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:35,311
- [Narrator] Alright,
 button it up.

1140
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,713
- [Narrator] Clear, go, go, go!

1141
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,382
(siren blaring)

1142
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:56,833
- How is he?

1143
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,534
- I don't know.

1144
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:00,403
- Sit down.

1145
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,308
- The doctors won't
 let anybody see him.

1146
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,914
His arm is gone.

1147
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,584
- [Coworker] Take a deep breath.

1148
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,393
- Nobody's allowed
  to visit him yet.

1149
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,896
I mean how's that
 gonna make him feel?

1150
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:27,797
No visitors.

1151
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,167
No arm.

1152
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,808
Oh.
  (slow paced music)

1153
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,978
Natalie would know
 exactly what to do.

1154
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,114
She'd know exactly what to say.

1155
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,644
- Excuse me miss.

1156
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,478
- Yes.

1157
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:17,347
- Hi.

1158
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,183
How's it going?

1159
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,730
Oh.

1160
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,498
Joke book.

1161
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,135
What did he want?

1162
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:43,740
Mr. Osteen.

1163
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,512
- Well he said
  everything's gonna be fine

1164
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,681
and that he's gonna
take care of everything.

1165
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:54,150
- I bet.

1166
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,385
Hey, how's the food here?

1167
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,820
Let's see.

1168
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,222
Yuck, awful.

1169
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,859
I'll bring pizza next time.

1170
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,227
- It's nice of you to come.

1171
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,696
- Well thank you Ruben.

1172
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:07,964
You kicking me out?

1173
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,167
- I just meant I
  know you're busy.

1174
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:14,937
- At least you got a view.

1175
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,710
Onion or meatball?

1176
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:23,379
On the pizza.

1177
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:28,484
- You don't have
  to bother with me.

1178
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,586
- I'll splurge, pizza
 with everything.

1179
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,036
Sorry, excuse me.

1180
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,237
I'm sorry.

1181
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,906
- Are you a nurse?

1182
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,942
- No, I'm just a friend
from the factory.

1183
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,913
- You must be Francis.

1184
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,181
- Yes.

1185
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:02,351
- Oh may I have a
 look at you darling?

1186
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,953
- [Frannie] Oh yes.

1187
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,958
- Oh, you know you
sound like your mother.

1188
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,195
How are you?

1189
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,029
- Fine.

1190
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,697
Spectacular actually.

1191
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:19,001
- Ruben's depressed
 and frightened.

1192
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,137
Needs someone to cheer him up.

1193
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,039
I hear you're very good at that.

1194
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,074
- Sure, naturally.

1195
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,377
It was very nice
meeting you Mrs. Mason.

1196
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,345
- Arlene, Arlene.

1197
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,317
What time will you
  be here tomorrow?

1198
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:39,989
- Well I don't think he's up
to a lot of visitors right now.

1199
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,791
- What time dear?

1200
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,625
Noon?

1201
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,294
- Yes ma'am.

1202
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,864
Bye bye.

1203
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:48,698
- Bye.

1204
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,405
(slow paced music)

1205
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,774
- I used to detest
  housework Alice.

1206
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:01,711
Now I can't wait to get
  home and start scrubbing.

1207
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,812
I cracked up huh?

1208
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,019
Looks beautiful.

1209
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,026
But what's wrong?

1210
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:17,960
It's too quiet.

1211
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,730
We need some people here.

1212
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,332
Lots of people with plates
  of food on their lap

1213
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:27,904
and music, kids crawling
around on the floor

1214
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,773
making a mess so
  Natalie could pace

1215
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,543
around nervously picking
  up all the little crumbs.

1216
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:34,477
We'd just have fun.

1217
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,182
We need some people Alice.

1218
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,489
We do.

1219
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,831
- [Ruben] You know you
 shouldn't of taken time off

1220
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,233
from work to come down here.

1221
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,369
- I didn't, it's my lunch break.

1222
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,504
So I can't stay long.

1223
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,673
- You shouldn't be here at all.

1224
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,507
- Why?

1225
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,143
Why not?

1226
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,377
- Because I don't
  want your pity.

1227
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,147
I don't want you
 cutting up my pizza,

1228
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,315
wiping my chin off.

1229
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,783
I don't need it

1230
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,252
- I have no intention of
 wiping off your chin Ruben.

1231
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,054
And I don't feel
 sorry for you okay.

1232
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,524
I'm concerned.

1233
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:23,492
Move over.

1234
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,641
What?

1235
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,642
What'd I do?

1236
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,378
- Nothing.

1237
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,616
My mother put you up to this?

1238
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,050
- Nah.

1239
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,086
I mean she prodded me
 along a little bit.

1240
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,689
But I was coming
 back the whole time.

1241
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:58,828
- Good.

1242
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:03,366
- I've known a ton of guys,

1243
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:07,503
but nothing like you.

1244
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:08,371
You're different.

1245
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:10,940
- I was always here.

1246
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,075
- I wasn't.

1247
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,212
I mean I was here
 but I wasn't really.

1248
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,214
- I know.

1249
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,750
I know, I used to watch you.

1250
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,019
- Watch me?

1251
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:23,819
- Mm hmm.

1252
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,822
I went to your farm once.

1253
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:32,528
I guess I was 12 you
 were probably 14.

1254
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:34,630
A woman.

1255
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,801
I was too intimidated
 to talk to you.

1256
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,871
I promised myself I would.

1257
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,106
I had it all planned out.

1258
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,442
What I was gonna say,
what you were gonna say.

1259
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:52,648
Anyway, my dad and I got there.

1260
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,087
You were all dressed in
 faded overalls and pigtails.

1261
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,225
And all I could do is stand
 there and look at you.

1262
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:06,962
I was just a foot away from you

1263
01:06:06,962 --> 01:06:10,066
but the words wouldn't come.

1264
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,069
I guess my dad knew
 I had a crush on you.

1265
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,371
He took your grandpa,
 went into the barn.

1266
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,575
I guess he thought
  if he'd leave me

1267
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,676
alone long enough
  with you that I'd

1268
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:21,877
get the nerve to speak.

1269
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,347
- Did you?

1270
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:26,082
- No.

1271
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,350
- Shoot.

1272
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,951
I wish you would of.

1273
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,219
Then I could be different.

1274
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,288
You could of help
  me become normal.

1275
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,226
- Well now, why'd
  I wanna do that?

1276
01:06:38,994 --> 01:06:39,829
Hmm?

1277
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,768
Why would anyone wanna
  change you Frannie Vaughn?

1278
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,651
- Ruben said that you
  and my gran were friends.

1279
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,353
- Best friends dear.

1280
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,858
- Did she ever mention
my great great grandma?

1281
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,692
- Delia.

1282
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,527
- Yes.

1283
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,597
What was she like?

1284
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,333
- Your great great grandma Delia

1285
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,268
had plenty of passion.

1286
01:07:21,036 --> 01:07:23,639
She was married to
  a good man really.

1287
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,509
One day she met a man

1288
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,244
who made her sick with love.

1289
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,213
He promised to take her away.

1290
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,450
Far away from North Carolina.

1291
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,420
All the way to a farm
 he had in Kentucky.

1292
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,289
She left her family
 and she and this man

1293
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,758
traveled for weeks

1294
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,494
until they reached
  his homestead.

1295
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,497
Where she was to
 begin her new life.

1296
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:53,235
One day Delia saw a man she'd
 known from her old home.

1297
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,305
"How'd you come to be
 in Kentucky" she said.

1298
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,341
"Well Delia" he said,

1299
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,943
"we're nowhere near Kentucky.

1300
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,112
"This is North Carolina."

1301
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,080
- North Carolina?

1302
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,085
- Her lover had taken her
around in circles all that time.

1303
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,957
She was only seven
  miles from home.

1304
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,292
She'd left him.

1305
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,595
Came back here to Silk Hope.

1306
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,496
- To her husband?

1307
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:23,732
- He took her back.

1308
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,669
But the community didn't.

1309
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,573
They refused to forgive her.

1310
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,275
Finally she had a child.

1311
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,677
- Great grandma Rose.

1312
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,879
- Yes, Rose.

1313
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,514
When Delia's husband died,

1314
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,485
community turned
 their backs on her.

1315
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,421
She had no one to turn to.

1316
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:51,961
Finally she was forced to return
to the man who tricked her.

1317
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,763
- I thought family
 stories were supposed

1318
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,232
to have happy endings?

1319
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,834
Poor Delia.

1320
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,709
Hey.

1321
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:07,543
- Hey.

1322
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:08,544
- How ya doing today?

1323
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:09,845
- I'm doing good.

1324
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,147
I'm doing good.

1325
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,381
- What's that?

1326
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,650
- They want me to sign
the termination papers.

1327
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,419
- What?

1328
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,354
- Well they think because
  I'm disabled now that--

1329
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,589
- Did you tell him to stuff it?

1330
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,425
- They're offering me
 a settlement Frannie.

1331
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,495
- What was all that
 rehab stuff for Ruben?

1332
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,530
To work right?

1333
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,234
Or don't you think you
 can still do the job?

1334
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:33,536
- Oh I can still do the job with

1335
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,638
one hand tied behind my back.

1336
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:36,739
(laughing)

1337
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,440
- That's funny.

1338
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,409
I knew you had a sense of humor.

1339
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,711
I'm sorry.

1340
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:43,546
- For what?

1341
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,216
- It's not any of
 my business really.

1342
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,217
- No it is your business.

1343
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:49,618
I care about what you think.

1344
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:51,954
- You do?

1345
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:52,788
- Yeah.

1346
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:53,622
- Why?

1347
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,523
- 'Cause I admire you.

1348
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,360
You know I live, most
 of us running around

1349
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,929
doing what we think
 we're supposed to do

1350
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,397
and I'll tell you what.

1351
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,832
After going through
what I've been through,

1352
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,668
makes you stop and think.

1353
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,436
I'm not putting
 things off anymore.

1354
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,006
Fun is a part of life.

1355
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:13,142
And you always knew that.

1356
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,944
- Well I kinda
 overdid the fun part.

1357
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:17,980
- Yeah but at least you did it.

1358
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:19,949
- Uh huh.

1359
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,628
- Don't be scared Frannie.

1360
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,901
- You can't fire Ruben.

1361
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,337
He's the best foreman
 y'all have ever had.

1362
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,938
I mean check out the statistics.

1363
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,774
His line is way more
 productive than anybody elses.

1364
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,010
- His past performance
 isn't the point.

1365
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,046
Because of his disability,
  he's now a safety hazard.

1366
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,015
- Why don't you ask the
assembly line workers

1367
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:55,718
if they feel safer with
him or without him.

1368
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,821
I have a petition with 30 names
on it demanding his return.

1369
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:03,792
- Employees don't decide
who'll be foreman here Francis!

1370
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,994
I do!

1371
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,528
- Well they're prepared
to go to the states

1372
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,530
safety board about
  the mills flagrant

1373
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,733
disregard for their safety.

1374
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,502
- Now there's no proof
 of willful negligence.

1375
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,137
- Oh really?

1376
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,072
Well I wonder why that
  reporter from the Raleigh

1377
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:18,707
News and Observer has
 been nosing around.

1378
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,576
He's left Ruben
  a dozen messages.

1379
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,611
You know they're gonna
 write an expose on the mill.

1380
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,281
One of those Pulitzer
 prize things.

1381
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,158
- What was the name
 of that guy again?

1382
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:36,992
- Who?

1383
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:38,761
- The reporter.

1384
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,297
- Oh I just made that part up.

1385
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,467
(chuckling)

1386
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:49,772
- Alright, this is ready.

1387
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:53,108
Where do you want to go where?

1388
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,309
- Petunias.

1389
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:55,277
- Petunias.

1390
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,378
- Sweet peas.

1391
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,247
- Sweet peas.

1392
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,815
- And Zinnias in the corner.

1393
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,650
- I thought we were having
  watermelon in the corner?

1394
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,484
- Oh.

1395
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,189
- [Ruben] Something
 I can do for ya?

1396
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:08,590
- Mind if we take a look around?

1397
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,858
- Yes I do.

1398
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,560
- Well we plan on making
an offer on the property

1399
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,528
if it meets our--

1400
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,362
- No sale.

1401
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,832
- But I spoke with the
 realtor this morning.

1402
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,001
- Well, we changed our mind.

1403
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,340
- Are you sure about this?

1404
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,141
- Positive.

1405
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,017
Don't lecture me.

1406
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,785
- I'm not gonna say a word.

1407
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,353
- A person can't let go
of something they love

1408
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:39,855
without a fight.

1409
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,423
- Couldn't agree with you more.

1410
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,559
- It's my home Ruben.

1411
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,465
- I think it's time we celebrate

1412
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:50,999
me getting out of the hospital.

1413
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:53,836
How about if I take you
  to dinner tomorrow night?

1414
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,904
- How about I make you
 dinner tomorrow night?

1415
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,172
Deviled chicken.

1416
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,141
- How 'bout that.

1417
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,409
- Match my mood.

1418
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,446
(light music)

1419
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,215
Oh my.

1420
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:10,152
(perky music)

1421
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:19,228
Oh!

1422
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,296
Oh no!

1423
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:31,306
No!

1424
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:33,242
Why?

1425
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,180
- What'd you put in this gravy?

1426
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,047
- The usual.

1427
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,715
Nothing special.

1428
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,050
Save room for pie.

1429
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,984
Coconut cream.

1430
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,520
- Home cooked pie.

1431
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,523
- Well, country cooked.

1432
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,728
(loud clanking)

1433
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,064
(squealing)

1434
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:38,507
Oh Alice

1435
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:43,312
- [Ruben] Looks like Alice
  likes country cooking too.

1436
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,247
- [Frannie] I wanted to do
  something great for you.

1437
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,683
- You did.

1438
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,954
(squealing)

1439
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,795
(slow paced music)

1440
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,609
- Well now, I talked it over

1441
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,677
with our legal advisor here.

1442
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,480
And we all agree.

1443
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,282
We want you back on the job!

1444
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,485
(chuckling)

1445
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:30,659
(slow paced music)

1446
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,568
- Sure is a beautiful night.

1447
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:41,703
- It's so peaceful.

1448
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,909
- I got another
  knock knock joke.

1449
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:47,743
- You do?

1450
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,544
Okay.

1451
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:53,615
- Knock knock.

1452
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,450
- Who's there?

1453
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,119
- Do we.

1454
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:58,287
- Do we again.

1455
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:03,125
Okay, Do we who?

1456
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:04,626
- Do we wanna get married?

1457
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,837
- Ruben,

1458
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,839
can I ask you something?

1459
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,810
Was that a joke?

1460
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:24,846
- No.

1461
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:29,518
- Do we?

1462
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,155
Yes we do.

1463
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,457
Oh yes.

1464
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:46,401
(slow paced music)

1465
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,503
I chose grandma's
dress instead of mama's

1466
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,405
because grandma had
 a great marriage.

1467
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:51,740
Mama wasn't so lucky.

1468
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,611
- Who'd of thought you'd
beat me to the altar.

1469
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,879
- Well you and Jake
 are such slow pokes.

1470
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,485
Mama'd be crazy about Ruben huh?

1471
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,956
- You did exactly what
 she wanted Frannie.

1472
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,658
- 'Cause I've gone
  and settled down.

1473
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,693
- No, 'cause you're happy.

1474
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,796
That's all mama ever wanted.

1475
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,002
- Yeah.

1476
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,671
- I Ruben, take thee Frannie

1477
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,241
to be my lawful wedded wife.

1478
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:28,610
To have and to hold

1479
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,580
from this day forward,

1480
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,182
til death do us part.

1481
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,420
- I Frannie, take thee Ruben

1482
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,656
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1483
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:42,724
To have and to hold

1484
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:44,926
from this day forth,

1485
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,529
til death do us part.

1486
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,800
- I now pronounce
  you man and wife.

1487
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:57,706
(cheering)
 (applauding)

1488
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:04,546
- Everybody ready?

1489
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,753
You're next Natalie!

1490
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:21,863
- I love it.

1491
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,366
Perfect.

1492
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,300
- Well of course it's perfect.

1493
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,002
It's a model home.

1494
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:27,869
- [Nat] Just what
we've been looking for.

1495
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,871
- It's too big for us.

1496
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,673
- We'll grow into it.

1497
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:32,708
- We can't afford it.

1498
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:37,045
- We'll use the money we
  get from selling the farm.

1499
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,814
- I just think we should
have the marriage first

1500
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:39,748
and then the house.

1501
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,219
- What are we waiting for Jake?

1502
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,656
Tell me, what are
  we waiting for?

1503
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:08,076
- Listen baby, I've
 got some bad news.

1504
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,812
Jake came by, they
  got a firm offer.

1505
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:11,980
- We can't sell the house.

1506
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,715
- It's a good offer Frannie.

1507
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:17,853
And technically the house
  is in Natalie's name.

1508
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:18,854
- We love this place.

1509
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:19,721
Natalie doesn't.

1510
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:20,589
- I know that.

1511
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,329
- Look, it's a
  letter from Delia.

1512
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:35,537
"My dearest Rose, how could
 I have been so foolish?

1513
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:38,006
"I brought shame to
 my family and myself.

1514
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,642
"I still suffer.

1515
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:42,644
"Reliving the humiliation."

1516
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,846
Ruben, she's talking
 about that man.

1517
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,448
You know the one
who tricked her.

1518
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,416
"So much so that
  I'm afraid I shall

1519
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:51,019
"end my days here in Wildwood."

1520
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:52,854
- Wildwood sanitarium?

1521
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:54,856
- [Frannie] Wasn't it--

1522
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:55,924
- It's an insane asylum.

1523
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,494
- Poor Delia.

1524
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:03,198
"What is left of
 me is sum of money.

1525
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,934
"I'm determined to put
this money to good use.

1526
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:10,005
"We must build a home in
Silk Hope for you Rose

1527
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,407
"and for all the generations
 of women to come."

1528
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:14,809
Listen.

1529
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,813
"The house must stay in the
 family and never be sold.

1530
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:20,749
"So that no matter
 what happens between

1531
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,551
"them and the men
  in their lives,

1532
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,153
"they'll have a
 home, a safe haven.

1533
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,622
"Love Delia."

1534
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,094
- How's Alice?

1535
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,029
- Sweetheart, I don't
think Frannie invited us

1536
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,363
here to discuss her pigs.

1537
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:39,000
We've accepted the offer.

1538
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,268
You'll get 50% of whatever we--

1539
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,970
- I'm not moving out.

1540
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,574
- It's from Delia.

1541
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,745
- It's real clear.

1542
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:52,480
This house has to
 stay in the family.

1543
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,982
- Francis.

1544
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,017
- You know the feeling
  I've had about the house?

1545
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,586
It all makes sense now.

1546
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,289
It's like Delia was
 guiding me almost.

1547
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,925
- This letter is not
 legal and binding.

1548
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,727
You talk some sense
 into her Ruben.

1549
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,629
- She's making
 perfect sense Jake.

1550
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,331
- You know what, sometimes
  I ask about Delia

1551
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:10,632
but mama would get vague.

1552
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,436
- Alright, Francis I think
  that what you're doing

1553
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,971
to Natalie is unfair.

1554
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,406
You are forcing her
 to choose between us.

1555
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,508
Besides, that piece
 of paper would not

1556
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,777
stand a chance in
  a court of law.

1557
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:24,779
- What about the laws
 of the heart Jake?

1558
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,117
I guess you don't
  know about that.

1559
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,832
- I'm glad that we've worked out

1560
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,601
some financial
  arrangement Ruben.

1561
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:49,971
And I'm pleased that you'll
 still be a part of the family.

1562
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,544
- Family my eyeball.

1563
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,948
You could have gotten
 a ton of money Ruben.

1564
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,216
They owe you.

1565
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,717
- I don't need a ton of money.

1566
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,156
I got everything I want
right here Frannie.

1567
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,228
Go on, take it.

1568
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,796
It's enough to buy out Natalie.

1569
01:22:22,937 --> 01:22:24,673
This will be our home now.

1570
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,174
We'll raise our children here.

1571
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,846
We'll tell them
 about you in overalls

1572
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,149
and me being too shy to speak.

1573
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,017
We'll tell them
 about Rose and Delia

1574
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,454
and they'll protect this
land and take care of it

1575
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,556
and they'll pass it
 on to their daughters.

1576
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,161
- When we have a little girl,

1577
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,263
can we call her Delia?

1578
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,631
- You bet we can.

1579
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,465
- Yes.

1580
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,027
Hi Nat.

1581
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:19,894
- [Ruben] Hi Nat.

1582
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,500
- What's wrong?

1583
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,270
Did he do something to you?

1584
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:30,805
Did he call off the wedding?

1585
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,540
- He lost all the
  money, he's gone.

1586
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:35,910
- I knew it.

1587
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,212
I knew he was up to something.

1588
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:40,248
I'm gonna hit him so hard.

1589
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:41,383
- He invested, he
 bought on the margin.

1590
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,283
He didn't tell me.

1591
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,420
- So the jerk lost
  all your money?

1592
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,021
- I kept asking him
when we were gonna move,

1593
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:48,256
when we were gonna get married.

1594
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:49,891
He kept making up excuses.

1595
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,126
He knew the money was gone,

1596
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,328
he didn't have the
  guts to tell me.

1597
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,562
- I'm gonna kill him.

1598
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:55,530
- He didn't do it
 on purpose Frannie.

1599
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,499
- It's not the money that hurts.

1600
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,634
Not being able to trust
him hurts the most.

1601
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,204
- Well you came to
  the right place.

1602
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,105
- She sure did.

1603
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,612
- That's why Delia
  built this house.

1604
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:11,946
So we'd have a safe place.

1605
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,149
- No matter what.

1606
01:24:15,049 --> 01:24:16,484
- No matter what.

1607
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:20,622
(slow paced music)

1608
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,326
Welcome home Nat.

1609
01:24:27,061 --> 01:24:29,631
(upbeat music)

1610
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,603
♪ Carolina skies

1611
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:38,006

1612
