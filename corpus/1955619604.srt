1
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:06,008
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

2
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,308
Traffic.

3
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,988
- Yeah, big game.

4
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,060
Milbrae is jammed.

5
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,999
- I've been here for,
it's been almost an hour.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,268
- Yes, I'm sorry.

7
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,169
The broker will be here any minute.

8
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,276
It's all fine.

9
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,476
- I was here alone, what if...

10
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:20,711
- She said we'll be fine.

11
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:22,700
- Let's just calm down.

12
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:24,036
We're here now.

13
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:25,870
George, just sit okay?

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,420
- I don't know if I can
go through with this.

15
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,787
- What?

16
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:35,129
- Of course you can go through with this.

17
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,489
Of course, that's why we're all here.

18
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,740
Why you waited.

19
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,089
- It's just, what if something happens?

20
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,519
- It's gonna be fine.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,998
Isn't that right?

22
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:48,999
- Right.

23
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:52,209
- You both have the money?

24
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,210
- Of course.

25
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,711
- We need to do this now, Bob.

26
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:00,545
If you want out.

27
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,607
- He doesn't want out,

28
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:03,608
do you Bob?

29
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,025
- He's coming Bob.

30
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:18,002
Let me have it.

31
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,235
It's all here, 25,000?

32
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,369
I'll be right back.

33
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,525
Gentlemen, this is Imran.

34
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:57,099
- Sorry to keep you.

35
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:02,449
Can I perhaps have a drink?

36
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,450
- The place is closed, it's just us.

37
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,980
- Is everything in order?

38
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,791
- You have the stones?

39
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,792
- Of course.

40
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,066
- I'm curious.

41
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:23,671
How can you offer to
sell these for such a...

42
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:24,672
- Low price?

43
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,452
Again.

44
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,590
- I did explain.

45
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,091
- I'd like to hear that again.

46
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:38,319
- Weight, quality, these are
fine stones, uncut stones.

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,243
Good quality.

48
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,972
My family has a license
to carry these stones.

49
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,350
The license describes the weight,

50
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,518
not quality, not quantity.

51
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,783
But who can judge quality
unless they're an expert?

52
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:56,623
So I fly once a month.

53
00:03:56,624 --> 00:04:00,263
I come here with my stones
and I leave with my stones.

54
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:02,931
Same weight, but better quality.

55
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,839
You see?

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,199
- So they're, I don't...

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,623
- I get it.

58
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,508
You bring these here,
and you sell them to us,

59
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,279
and then you fly back with
what, different diamonds?

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,406
- Better.

61
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,348
- Better than these?

62
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,349
- Bigger.

63
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,519
But these are you understand, fine stones.

64
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,010
For this price.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,975
- They're good.

66
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,127
I'm satisfied.

67
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,545
- But this isn't,

68
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:34,698
it's not legal?

69
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,559
- Bob, we talked, you told me.

70
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,109
- It's just,

71
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,452
I'll be right back.

72
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:56,241
- You assured me you had good buyers.

73
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:58,731
You assured me.

74
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,869
- Everything is fine.

75
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,620
Mister Walker simply,
he just needs a moment.

76
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:12,169
- I'll check on him.

77
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,514
He's always like this.

78
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:37,398
You all right there?

79
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,668
- I'm sorry, I just...

80
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,181
- It's fine, just take a moment.

81
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,769
- I can barely say.

82
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,741
- Yeah well, we're almost done.

83
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,506
You got our money, right?

84
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:48,507
- Right?

85
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,249
I'm sorry, it's such a big risk.

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,781
You know I just met him last week.

87
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:53,713
- Yeah, me too.

88
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:55,722
It's almost over, so why don't we.

89
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,422
Shut it.

90
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,714
Ah Christ.

91
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:19,002
- What's going on there?

92
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,024
- The police, fucking hell.

93
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,250
- The money!

94
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,304
- We need to get out of here.

95
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,412
- She's gone off with it.

96
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:25,772
She's got my money.

97
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:26,606
- Forget the fucking money,

98
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,273
the police are coming back here.

99
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,623
- It's still there, the
money's still there?

100
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:33,504
- The police are coming back.

101
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:34,337
- I can make it.

102
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:35,170
- It's not worth it.

103
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:36,335
- If something happens
of course I can make it.

104
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,336
I can get all into this.

105
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:58,264
- Stop right there, don't move.

106
00:06:58,265 --> 00:06:59,439
- God, sorry I...

107
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,211
Turn round, I'm not
gonna tell you again sir.

108
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:08,771
Who do you think you're kidding pal?

109
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,720
You're under arrest.

110
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,971
You're not obliged to say...

111
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,800
I must caution you, you're
not obliged to say anything.

112
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,131
Anything you do say, will be noted down,

113
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:40,491
and used against you.

114
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,611
Do you understand?

115
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:43,479
Do you understand?

116
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,479
- Yes.

117
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,418
- He's in a taxi.

118
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:59,069
- You think he knows any
fucking thing we're doing?

119
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:03,705
- English prick.

120
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:02,168
- Cara?

121
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,983
- The big called.

122
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,207
He's got another sucker
if you're interested.

123
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,208
- Maybe.

124
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:08,929
They didn't just sweeten the deal though,

125
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,489
you know front and back,
like we talked about.

126
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,128
- I'll see what they say.

127
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:16,179
Also, I just got a call
from Frank over at Bimmer's.

128
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,499
Some kid is asking for you.

129
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,678
- Kid?

130
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,478
- Says Joe sent him.

131
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,541
- My Joe?

132
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,792
- Yours.

133
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:25,683
- He's there now?

134
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,862
- Uh huh.

135
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,374
Said he needs to tell you something.

136
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,875
Wouldn't say what.

137
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,861
You heard anything from Joe?

138
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:34,362
- Not for a while.

139
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,523
This kid, he's Irish?

140
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:40,107
- Don't know, I can ask.

141
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,002
I'd assume.

142
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,669
You know him?

143
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,607
- Bring him over.

144
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:48,468
- To the house?

145
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:50,229
You're sure?

146
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,313
- Call when you're close.

147
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,201
Sure?

148
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:53,781
How's the old man?

149
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,576
You and I, we met at a dog track.

150
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,627
Because we had a mark, a Jamaican guy.

151
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,636
- Yeah, really drunk.

152
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:06,676
- I'd been feeding him vodka all day.

153
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:08,481
And Joe played inside
man, took him off for me.

154
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,482
- Yeah.

155
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:13,100
- Shame the prick came up empty.

156
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:14,903
- Joe was pissed.

157
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:15,904
- He was.

158
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:20,303
Haven't heard from his since.

159
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:21,304
Till now.

160
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:26,609
- I'm sorry.

161
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:32,755
- It's Joe that sent you?

162
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:35,506
- I didn't know where else to go.

163
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:37,517
I found him,

164
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,648
a few days ago.

165
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,179
Someone killed Joe.

166
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,317
- Who?

167
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,315
- The place was a mess.

168
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,195
- His place, he's still there?

169
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:24,446
- Yeah, I legged it out as, I'm sorry.

170
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,030
- He's still there?

171
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,110
Any idea who?

172
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:41,931
- We hadn't did anything
for weeks, a dry spell.

173
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,099
- A dry spell?

174
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,337
- Oh, who's this?

175
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,403
- Ian?

176
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,742
- Rob, long fucking time.

177
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,576
- Where are you?

178
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:11,835
- Are you in London?

179
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,253
- No I'm up home, in Glasgow.

180
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:16,671
- Wait, this is a bad time.

181
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,260
- I need a favor.

182
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,578
- What is that?

183
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,692
- I need you to check on Joe for me.

184
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,079
- What happened?

185
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,081
- I'm not sure, I need eyes over there.

186
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:26,713
And, he doesn't use a phone.

187
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:30,169
- He doesn't use a phone,
tell me did he catch one?

188
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,644
Have you tried the kid?

189
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,478
He's been running around

190
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,692
with this little Irish prick for months.

191
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:37,167
Fucking some wired little shit.

192
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,676
- He's right here.

193
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:40,425
He can hear you.

194
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:43,345
- It'll take me half an hour to get there.

195
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:44,429
- Take a cab.

196
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:46,831
It'll be faster.

197
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:57,017
Well, I've got some time.

198
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,018
Come on.

199
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,516
Close the door.

200
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:15,287
- You made that?

201
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:16,288
- Yes.

202
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,367
- Really is the country life.

203
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:22,217
- It's quiet.

204
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:23,218
Peaceful.

205
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,337
I rent a place in town.

206
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:30,505
A speakeasy with a car
house like.

207
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,783
- How long?

208
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:40,784
- Soon.

209
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,355
So,

210
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,086
a wire scam?

211
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,885
- What?

212
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:58,122
- You into something about a wire.

213
00:16:58,123 --> 00:17:01,386
- Yeah, we used that
backroom in Chaplin Street.

214
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,847
- I know the place, why is that shuttered?

215
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,085
- No, it was a phone thing.

216
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:07,783
I found this kid could
text the race results

217
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,252
before anyone else got them, apparently.

218
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,958
And the marks would give
Joe money to make the bets.

219
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,090
- But he didn't?

220
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:15,500
Make the bets?

221
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,334
- He played the stall.

222
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,167
If the horse won he'd say

223
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,079
he couldn't get the bet down in time,

224
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,449
and give back the money.

225
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,283
- You lost me.

226
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,566
- You know Joe, like he
knows that inside track

227
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,753
and won a few races,

228
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:27,748
so all I had to do was
predict first or second place.

229
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:30,148
And this kid, the one with the text.

230
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,220
He would text those to the suckers,

231
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,740
but he'd flip 'em, right?

232
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,741
So say,

233
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:40,719
Folding Money come second
to Bagatelle, 2:15 Kempton.

234
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,929
Like that, like he makes
it really confusing.

235
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,346
- Okay, then what?

236
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:45,777
- So of course they check the text,

237
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:48,369
and then in comes Joe and they
send him to make the bets,

238
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,537
like big bets.

239
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:53,288
- Yes.

240
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,225
- More than half the time, Joe
was riding the money, right?

241
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:00,047
But the text we originally sent,

242
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:03,117
was flipped to make the
marks bet on the loser.

243
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:05,436
So the way we worded it,
the way the kid worded it,

244
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,629
was to make them bet on the horse

245
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,218
most likely to come fucking second.

246
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:10,458
- So they'd lose.

247
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,567
- Damn fucking right they'd lose.

248
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:15,117
Of course, Joe never pays the bets.

249
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:17,596
We kept all the money.

250
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,476
- The marks don't beef
when they see the result?

251
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,886
- Oh yeah, oh yeah, go crazy.

252
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,205
Like yell, and threaten me and stuff,

253
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,338
but that's until they check the texts.

254
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,178
See the text is the best part,

255
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,247
like the text is the scam.

256
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,599
Because this kid, is like genius.

257
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,557
He could hack these phones, send a text,

258
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:38,338
then later go in there delete
that text and replace it.

259
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,587
You know what I mean?

260
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,216
- The first tells them
to bet on Folding Money.

261
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,976
- The second tells them
Bagatelle come first.

262
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:47,063
The second goes to
Folding Money out of that.

263
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:49,461
- And Joe came up with this?

264
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,820
- No, with the scam sure but.

265
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:53,738
- How much did he take?

266
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:55,642
- A lot.

267
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,860
You know we had the system.

268
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,327
But he OD'ed a few weeks
ago and it all dried up.

269
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:02,759
- You think?

270
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,097
- Ah, no, no no no, he was our clover,

271
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,265
just a hacker.

272
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:08,204
And the suckers were all cooled out,

273
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:11,007
that was the beauty of it.

274
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:14,657
Joe had something else
going, something big.

275
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,158
- I'm sure he did.

276
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:19,377
No idea at all?

277
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:20,961
The something else?

278
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,304
Inside.

279
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:38,590
- He's still out.

280
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:41,049
No he's a funny old man.

281
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,867
The place is dark, Rob.

282
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:43,906
- Can you get in?

283
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,875
- Oh fucking hell,
okay give me a minute.

284
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:47,739
- He's uh...

285
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,397
- Don't speak.

286
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,148
Not one fucking word.

287
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:05,867
- I'm in.

288
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:11,846
Joe?

289
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,794
Sure I can smell him.

290
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,351
- Keep going and tell me what you can see.

291
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,650
- Fucking hell the place is a mess.

292
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:30,651
I see him.

293
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,523
He's, shit somebody's
beaten the shit out of him.

294
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:38,679
- Can you send a picture?

295
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,164
- What? Fuck off, I'm in a fucking game.

296
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,820
- Ian, send a picture.

297
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:46,203
- Okay okay, this is
our square now, right?

298
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,621
- Not even close.

299
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:00,821
- Right?

300
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,611
- Get out of there,
lock the place back up.

301
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:04,431
- Do you want me to call anyone?

302
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:07,182
- No leave as is, just walk away.

303
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:23,457
Did you get out?

304
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,523
- We done?

305
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:27,524
- No.

306
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:30,364
- Fucking kill all.

307
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,637
Why are you here?

308
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,859
- Joe, he told me.

309
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:00,257
He said you were the best grifter up here.

310
00:22:00,258 --> 00:22:02,008
- Okay, and so?

311
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,578
- He turned you out before me.

312
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:09,079
- Answer the fucking question.

313
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,456
What the fuck do you want?

314
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:14,642
- Joe...

315
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:15,739
- Joe's dead.

316
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,943
- Yeah, but.

317
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,918
- So what the fuck are you doing here?

318
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,336
- He had a score.

319
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,642
A big one.

320
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,798
- Answer the fucking question.

321
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,470
- He had a score, a big one.

322
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,208
- And your fucking luck.

323
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:33,292
So what the fuck are you doing, here?

324
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,187
- He told me I could, that you, that...

325
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:42,299
- Now look at the fucking picture.

326
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,633
And Joe is dead.

327
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,990
Was that you?

328
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,741
Was that fucking you?

329
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,508
- It wasn't me, it wasn't me.

330
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
- Yeah.

331
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,317
Let's get our drink.

332
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,620
Now you sit on the marks for him,

333
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:23,038
learn the markets, take bets.

334
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:28,823
When Joe was the only one
pulling the old school scams,

335
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,674
Pitch and draw,

336
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,732
Jamaican switch,

337
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:36,483
we used to play the ring
game in bars, Essex.

338
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:40,621
- First thing he showed me
was how to attract brag.

339
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:42,692
It was pub games mostly, but,

340
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:43,821
it was good money.

341
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,781
- Yeah, for me it was gin.

342
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:48,972
He taught me how to pick
two and ghost a card.

343
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:50,140
Ever see that?

344
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:56,172
Just one extra card is
enough to beat most chumps.

345
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:59,130
But you've got to get at
the right card, right?

346
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:00,509
Now the dumb play is to palm it back

347
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,770
onto the deck of a stump,

348
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:03,919
because smart players,
they watch like hawks

349
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,380
and they mind all the
fucking cards, right?

350
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:09,490
But Joe had a way to clean up,

351
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,399
without palming anything.

352
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,150
Like, nothing to see.

353
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:15,831
A thing of beauty.

354
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:26,490
Tell me about the score.

355
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:28,408
What was he sitting on?

356
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,407
I think you wouldn't be here
if you didn't need my help.

357
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,381
- It's big.

358
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:42,871
- Right.

359
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:43,872
How big?

360
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:45,740
- Like half a rock,

361
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:47,741
maybe more, all scratch.

362
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,060
- Where are you staying?

363
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:59,478
- In the hotel, by the river.

364
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,100
- Hey Maggie.

365
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:09,250
Can you send a cab over?

366
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:10,251
Good.

367
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,811
Bill me.

368
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:15,524
I knew you'd be faint.

369
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:21,119
Well, thanks for letting me know.

370
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,269
Hope you get something going.

371
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,103
- It's not bullshit.

372
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,082
- Listen Tom, Joe never
made more than 20 grand

373
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,061
in a single week.

374
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:27,650
If he's told you he's
got a score that big,

375
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,300
he's blowing smoke up your ass, I promise.

376
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,884
- It's a card game.

377
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,700
Right, it's big money,
serious fucking money

378
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,284
up here in Glasgow.

379
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,200
Joe's been holding onto this for a while.

380
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,650
He needed the money, a lot of money,

381
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,401
to get into the game.

382
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:51,882
- There's only one game laid out up here.

383
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,370
There's only one, and there's no way in.

384
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,202
I should know.

385
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,620
- Joe had it, Joe had the in.

386
00:26:11,381 --> 00:26:12,381
- Let's see,

387
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:15,481
sure this is real?

388
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:20,741
You called?

389
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:22,632
- No.

390
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,328
But you know who it is?

391
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,443
- If this number is real,

392
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:33,888
this is a fucking jackpot.

393
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:40,091
I'll need to check this.

394
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:48,719
You up for some luck?

395
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,700
Put some cash in your pocket?

396
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:53,118
- What's the gig?

397
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,249
- Well maybe you can learn something.

398
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,900
A beard said you had to
tell tomorrow at noon.

399
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:02,726
If I'm not there by 12:15, I'm not coming.

400
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:04,255
- Okay.

401
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:11,465
- How's it going?

402
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:12,873
- What's in the bag?

403
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,513
- Nothing.

404
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:15,764
- What's in it?

405
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:21,694
Your number's good.

406
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:23,195
That's a solid in.

407
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,022
Tell me something,

408
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:30,161
why do you think didn't
say anything to me?

409
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:31,561
- I don't know.

410
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:34,011
- I've been waiting for that
number for two fucking years.

411
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,840
I just don't understand.

412
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,091
- I don't know.
- How come?

413
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,105
Tell me a trick.

414
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,575
Can you keep your mouth shut?

415
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:45,243
Do what you're told?

416
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:48,189
Let's find out.

417
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:08,855
Mister Olin?

418
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:10,396
- Yes.

419
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:11,846
- I understood we would meet alone.

420
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:12,776
- These are my sons,

421
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,859
I'm afraid they insisted.

422
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:20,407
They treat me like an old man.

423
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:23,055
You are Mister Will?

424
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:25,463
- And this is my associate, Danny.

425
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:28,335
I'm afraid we only have a
little time before our flight.

426
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:29,333
You have the money?

427
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,826
- Yes, yes of course.

428
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:33,410
But I'm very sorry,

429
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:37,316
but you understand I must
be extremely careful.

430
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,116
- You spoke with Karl in Amsterdam, yes?

431
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,059
- Yes.

432
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,996
- And he explained to you how this works?

433
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:45,747
- Yes, you have chains, 24 karat,

434
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,585
and I may buy them at a fair price.

435
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,086
- Very fair.

436
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:58,354
- They are all of this quality.

437
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,234
- I don't have much time Mister Olin.

438
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,068
I'm sorry to say I don't have

439
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,196
a great deal of patience, either.

440
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,030
If you've spoken to Karl

441
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,460
you should already know
what you're buying.

442
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:06,544
- I do, I do.

443
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:17,351
Now, if I might test one
or two more, to be sure.

444
00:31:17,352 --> 00:31:21,372
- Are you deliberately trying
to upset me Mister Olin?

445
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:23,300
And what time is your
flight back to London?

446
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,492
- I will not risk taking so
much gold through an airport.

447
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:27,532
We have a train.

448
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:28,852
- Well I do have a flight,

449
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,570
in just over an hour.

450
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:31,432
And I don't have time for you

451
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,268
to scratch every chain in this case.

452
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,279
- I only want to test a couple.

453
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,978
But random.

454
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,858
You understand, this is
a great deal of money.

455
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:43,519
- This is your first
transaction with us, correct?

456
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,338
You were made aware of why
we're selling these so,

457
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,999
reasonably?

458
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,620
- Please, please, do not be offended.

459
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:53,169
But I could not in all good conscience.

460
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,489
- The hell with it.

461
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,129
I think you wasted a journey,

462
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,340
and a good deal of my time.

463
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,489
- All I am asking

464
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,889
is to allow a simple caution on my part.

465
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,973
Please, Mister Will I mean no insult.

466
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,700
- In 20 minutes, no more.

467
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:09,870
- It'll only take a few moments.

468
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:12,204
- Not here, not in the open.

469
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:15,471
- Then where?

470
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,820
- Your room, I'll meet you upstairs.

471
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:24,488
Danny, Danny will stay with you.

472
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,031
- Perhaps we can save
some time, if I could?

473
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:26,019
I promise not to put any in my pocket.

474
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,770
It's fine, it's fine.

475
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,293
We will wait.

476
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Martin.

477
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:41,092
You have it?

478
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:45,472
Do not take your eyes off those chains.

479
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,743
I told you, if they try something,

480
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:54,901
shoot him in the leg.

481
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:57,549
The other one too, you have a silencer.

482
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,040
- No.

483
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,989
I just bought these at the bus station.

484
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,287
- I thought they come with silencer.

485
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:05,288
- No, Papa.

486
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:08,241
- Come in.

487
00:34:12,462 --> 00:34:13,462
- All set?

488
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,901
You have the money?

489
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:28,069
- Of course.

490
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
- Wait.

491
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:44,770
Mister Olin I came a long way,

492
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,821
and I'd hate to think I wasted my time.

493
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,722
- I don't understand.

494
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:51,770
- Karl explained to you that
this is a regular shipment,

495
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:53,840
that we do this several times each year.

496
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,160
- Yes.

497
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,361
- And Karl has done a
lot of business with me.

498
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,730
- So he says.

499
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,972
- He's a rich man.

500
00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:03,170
- He seems so.

501
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:05,754
- And you trust this man, Karl?

502
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,355
- I do not distrust him.

503
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:11,296
- Now why don't we start again?

504
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:13,395
Do this properly.

505
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:17,747
In this case, I have 21.3
pounds of 24 karat gold,

506
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,906
and a very large sum of money.

507
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,496
And that bag which my
associate is holding,

508
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,696
you say is 100,000 pounds cash?

509
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:24,530
- Count it.

510
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:26,947
- I could, some say I should.

511
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,896
But this is not a
typical deal Mister Olin.

512
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:34,064
This is, as they say, under the table.

513
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:36,827
- Naturally.

514
00:35:36,828 --> 00:35:39,536
- Then let's keep it that way.

515
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,436
Now you have the money,

516
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,593
which we would have accepted downstairs,

517
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,707
without checking or counting.

518
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,896
I have the chains which you
agreed to accept in good faith.

519
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,995
Now we're here in this room.

520
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,696
Now we can count your money,
you can test the chains,

521
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,416
as you wish.

522
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,715
- Yes, that's why...

523
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:58,383
- But what I'm saying is, don't.

524
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:02,406
You take the chains, we take the cash,

525
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,407
no checking, no counting, as agreed.

526
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:09,376
- Why would I do that?

527
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,377
- Business.

528
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:15,507
I'm not interested in selling
one case to you, but 100.

529
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:18,035
Over time you will make a staggering,

530
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:21,696
life-changing amount of
money from this deal.

531
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:24,216
But if you want to look at my stuff,

532
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:27,045
this is the only case for you.

533
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:30,368
You will double your money, once,

534
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:31,536
and that's it.

535
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:38,626
- You're right of course.

536
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:39,877
I'm very sorry.

537
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:46,045
But I must check the chains.

538
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,546
- Count the money.

539
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:07,446
- These are good.

540
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:09,116
- You're certain?

541
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:09,967
- All there?

542
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,550
- Checks out.

543
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:16,590
- Mister Olin, enjoy your gold.

544
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,766
And should we meet again,

545
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,434
do me the courtesy of
leaving these at home.

546
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,647
- What the hell just happened?

547
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,065
- We made a deal.

548
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:46,127
- But I don't understand, who got conned?

549
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:48,735
That case was full of chains, gold chains.

550
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:50,167
- Right.

551
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:51,386
- Like solid gold.

552
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,470
- Solid gold.

553
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:55,897
- They're real?

554
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:56,731
You're not gonna switch 'em?

555
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:57,568
- What for?

556
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:58,886
They'll all check out.

557
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:03,276
They can test 'em all
the way back to London.

558
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:06,055
- You switched the fuckin' tests.

559
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:06,996
- Easier to palm one of these,

560
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:09,617
then check your whole fuckin' suitcase.

561
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:11,665
It gives 'em the results
they're expecting,

562
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,749
the chains aren't even
worth half what they paid.

563
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:19,594
- And that's it?

564
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:21,535
- Just getting started.

565
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:23,164
Later on, the Blitch
Brothers will catch up

566
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:24,814
with Harold and his idiot sons,

567
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,494
before they get on the train.

568
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:28,284
Flash a few fake ID's,

569
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,205
and say they're all under arrest

570
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:31,625
for possession of stolen merchandise.

571
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,574
Suddenly, Harold's in the
middle of a big,

572
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:36,054
and he'll do anything to get out.

573
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:38,185
- Anything?

574
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,924
- And make a deal.

575
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,336
Harold agrees to set me up,

576
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:43,827
calls our man in Amsterdam,

577
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:46,725
fucking begs to buy another case.

578
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:49,376
Makes more money, his own money,

579
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:51,837
and he takes a case,

580
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:53,437
but this time he doesn't
check what's inside,

581
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:54,555
because he thinks if we start waiting

582
00:39:54,556 --> 00:39:56,974
to field my call on the way out.

583
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:58,004
- You get him again.

584
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,103
- That's old Banky's animal scam.

585
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:02,613
Different story, but the
principle's the same.

586
00:40:02,614 --> 00:40:05,963
Hit the same mark twice
with the same fucking scam.

587
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:07,323
- He doesn't go to the police?

588
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,024
- That's the best part.

589
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:11,923
We send the police down, the real police.

590
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:13,054
And he gets caught walking out the door,

591
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:16,443
with a couple of pounds of
cheap, hard-cut Colombian.

592
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:17,795
Goodbye Mister Olin, and good luck

593
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:21,584
explaining any of this shit to a judge.

594
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,576
- You got the chains,
do it all over again.

595
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:25,410
- This time next year.

596
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:29,143
- Now what?

597
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:32,394
- Take the money to Cara, get my split.

598
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,384
- What do I get?

599
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,385
- Educated.

600
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:05,085
- Have you worked it out yet?

601
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:07,999
What he really wants?

602
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,844
- Says he wants to learn.

603
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:12,512
- A bit cliched, no?

604
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:16,900
This won't end well, I promise.

605
00:42:19,877 --> 00:42:22,591
- But I kind of safe for the boy.

606
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,613
- I just cut your end.

607
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:27,697
You can slice that, any way you like.

608
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:34,127
If he's not scamming
you now, he will soon.

609
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:38,630
What's really going on in there?

610
00:42:40,664 --> 00:42:42,331
- Joe is dead.

611
00:42:44,003 --> 00:42:46,836
Someone beat the old man to death.

612
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:50,770
The boy says he found him a few days ago.

613
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:53,688
- Then why come here to you?

614
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:59,251
- Apparently, Joe's been talking
about a score for months.

615
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:00,585
In our backyard.

616
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,213
Something big.

617
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:06,451
- That Joe never told you?

618
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:09,011
- How it works.

619
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:11,493
- He thinks you'll help him.

620
00:43:11,494 --> 00:43:13,013
To take it down.

621
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,014
- That's what he thinks.

622
00:43:15,974 --> 00:43:17,974
- So, what is it?

623
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:21,714
- It's a card game.

624
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:22,715
50K buy in.

625
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:24,871
- I know Matt.

626
00:43:26,046 --> 00:43:28,506
- He's got the number.

627
00:43:28,507 --> 00:43:31,045
Says Joe's been sitting on it,

628
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:32,535
for months.

629
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:34,156
- Months.

630
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:35,407
- Months.

631
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,630
- That means,

632
00:43:41,426 --> 00:43:43,509
you know what that means.

633
00:43:49,656 --> 00:43:51,073
What will you do?

634
00:43:53,677 --> 00:43:55,760
- Give him what he wants.

635
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:04,524
Up here, it's not like London.

636
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,425
It's too small to
racketeer in local money,

637
00:44:07,426 --> 00:44:09,025
which is a good thing.

638
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:10,922
We're mostly moving outside marks.

639
00:44:10,923 --> 00:44:13,505
Money coming in and out of the city.

640
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:15,839
Investors, gamblers, crooks.

641
00:44:17,426 --> 00:44:19,585
Anyone worth cutting into.

642
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:21,556
The con we'll work,

643
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:24,851
it's not like a picking
pockets or rippin' off granny.

644
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:26,529
You want to con someone,

645
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,630
you get to figure at one thing,

646
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:30,381
and the rest is easy.

647
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:34,689
And some cons you throw in there,

648
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,240
the X box, medical cure, eternal
youth, watch 'em line up.

649
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:41,299
But others, you've got to
know something specific.

650
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,206
Art collector, I've got a Picasso.

651
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:46,499
Investor, I've got an inside deal.

652
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,830
Gambler, I've got a bet you can't lose.

653
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:50,350
Get it?

654
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:51,899
Once they're on the hook,

655
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,800
the game is yours to lose.

656
00:44:53,801 --> 00:44:56,968
Make all suckers special for a reason.

657
00:44:58,259 --> 00:44:59,200
Look at this guy,

658
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:00,549
what's he tellin' you?

659
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:01,575
- Banker.

660
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:02,497
Success.

661
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:04,319
- You can tell
that he wants some space.

662
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,298
Nice car, house, usual shit.

663
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:08,738
Should be wearin' a sign saying, I'm easy,

664
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:09,906
come get some.

665
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:13,421
What about her?

666
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:16,381
- Security?

667
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:17,222
Safety?

668
00:45:17,223 --> 00:45:18,621
- Right.

669
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:20,822
If you get to her,
she'll do half the work.

670
00:45:20,823 --> 00:45:23,033
People can't help being people.

671
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:26,201
Most of the time, they con themselves.

672
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,793
You show them what they want,

673
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:32,377
and they get what they deserve.

674
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:48,003
- What about them?

675
00:45:48,933 --> 00:45:50,516
- Dignity, respect.

676
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,462
Give a taste of that.

677
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:57,901
Jesus, just fuckin' talk to
them and they'll hand it over.

678
00:45:57,902 --> 00:45:58,913
It can be a hard deal
with married couples,

679
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:00,642
sometimes you know.

680
00:46:00,643 --> 00:46:04,139
Usually they'll wait
until one of them cops it.

681
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,973
Loneliness can be our best friend.

682
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:09,424
And I bet you the pages in the Herald

683
00:46:09,425 --> 00:46:12,008
make a crackin' read sometimes.

684
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:17,536
In the end, they miss our company

685
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:20,870
more than they'll ever miss their money.

686
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:25,756
Joe was smart,

687
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:27,591
kept it simple,

688
00:46:27,592 --> 00:46:28,552
at the ultimate level,

689
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:32,591
short cons, betting joints,
and soft swindles at the track.

690
00:46:32,592 --> 00:46:33,951
If the mark was too big,

691
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:36,583
he'd roll, and pass it to someone
further up the food chain.

692
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:37,417
- Like you.

693
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:40,238
- Or Alex and Paul,
sometimes bigger crews.

694
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,303
But he never overplayed his hand.

695
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:44,471
Never took any real risks.

696
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:47,343
A few years ago,

697
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:50,194
if I had anything in London
I started cutting him in.

698
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:52,195
Take off man, convincer,

699
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,647
you name it, Joe could do it.

700
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:57,247
He was solid.

701
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:58,744
Step up to anything,

702
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:02,162
as long as someone else did the leg work.

703
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,532
Tell him you know, and he'll teach you.

704
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,345
- Change race, the betting fixing,

705
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:11,225
passports thing, dealing from the bottom.

706
00:47:11,226 --> 00:47:12,595
- What about the money?

707
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,429
- What about it?

708
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,929
- Is it just half?

709
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:18,555
You'd have kept it.

710
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:23,811
The one thing Joe taught
me, and I never forgot,

711
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:25,913
that all the old-timers do,

712
00:47:25,914 --> 00:47:27,913
was to protect my stash.

713
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:29,473
I don't give a damn whose money I take,

714
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:32,974
but when it's mine, it fucking stays mine.

715
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:39,809
You can't always arrange
on buying working money.

716
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,220
Somewhere safe, you got a hold out,

717
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:44,020
and you fill that with cash.

718
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:45,710
18 grand, 20.

719
00:47:45,711 --> 00:47:48,044
Something you might go if you need to.

720
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,865
Your bank, a deal stash,

721
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:53,402
that's something I'm working a hit.

722
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,846
Where did Joe keep his money, day to day?

723
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:58,777
- In his shoe, like a paper brick.

724
00:47:58,778 --> 00:48:00,417
And he had his socks made to hold it.

725
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:02,188
- How much do you have right now?

726
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:03,897
You're not?

727
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:04,731
What about his hold out?

728
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:06,635
You have to keep that.

729
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:08,349
- He never.

730
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,183
- His bank?

731
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:10,869
He had to keep his deal stash.

732
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,399
Did you get it?

733
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,869
You don't know because
he didn't trust you.

734
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:16,445
You know why?

735
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:18,789
Because con men don't trust anyone,

736
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,623
especially each other.

737
00:48:26,527 --> 00:48:28,926
This is how it works.

738
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,071
If I get conned or jammed up,

739
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:32,383
the bank roll's the first thing I get out.

740
00:48:32,384 --> 00:48:35,352
The holder is a cherry
who has no other way out.

741
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:38,592
You know enough for some trip
to be bought or something.

742
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:41,512
But I never give up the bank.

743
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:43,269
You can carve my ass with a bacon slicer,

744
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,103
or put needles in my eyes,

745
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:46,103
you'll never get the deal stash.

746
00:48:46,104 --> 00:48:48,853
Joe didn't teach you that?

747
00:48:48,854 --> 00:48:49,854
He just did.

748
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:56,463
You do what I tell you, when I tell you.

749
00:48:56,464 --> 00:48:57,863
You don't fucking think,

750
00:48:57,864 --> 00:48:59,693
when it's already thought for you.

751
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:01,392
You got me?

752
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:02,393
- Yeah.

753
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:04,792
- This game is real.

754
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,362
Phone number is real.

755
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,623
We need a week to find
our way in, maybe more.

756
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:09,933
- How do I know you won't go without me?

757
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:10,934
- You don't.

758
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,070
That should keep you fed and washed.

759
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,110
You're paid until the end of the month.

760
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:18,944
- You are teaching me.

761
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:45,876
- Look at us, the gang's all here.

762
00:49:49,003 --> 00:49:50,170
You know boys,

763
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:52,282
nice to see you all again,

764
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:54,866
without all the calls and ties.

765
00:50:00,906 --> 00:50:03,406
You see me in there, sunshine?

766
00:50:10,026 --> 00:50:12,914
Tonight we're gonna be
playing a different game.

767
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:16,082
It's called, where's my fucking money?

768
00:50:17,136 --> 00:50:19,615
Now you chaps may not be
familiar with the rules to

769
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,556
where's my fucking money?

770
00:50:21,557 --> 00:50:24,333
So permit me to give
you a little refresher.

771
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:25,584
Any objections?

772
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:27,954
- Fuck it off.

773
00:50:27,955 --> 00:50:31,062
- I'm gonna ask, where's my fucking money?

774
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:33,061
You're gonna tell me,
where's my fucking money.

775
00:50:33,062 --> 00:50:35,501
Then you're gonna tell me
where's your fucking money.

776
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:37,438
You see this is a fair game, boys.

777
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:40,773
First I get my money, then I get yours.

778
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:44,685
All of it at once, which'll
save us all some fucking time,

779
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:46,103
which reminds me,

780
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:49,315
my friend here's gonna be
asking most of the questions,

781
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:51,469
and if memory serves,

782
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,470
he is not a patient man.

783
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:57,155
So, I'm gonna cut one of you loose.

784
00:50:57,156 --> 00:50:59,051
Two in the hand's worth one in the bush.

785
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:00,635
That's fair, right?

786
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,580
Let's see,

787
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,147
eenie, meenie,

788
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:07,628
minie, Moe,

789
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:09,880
catch a nigger

790
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,940
by the toe,

791
00:51:14,986 --> 00:51:16,069
if it hollers

792
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,741
let it go

793
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:21,326
eenie,

794
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:22,502
meenie,

795
00:51:22,503 --> 00:51:23,503
minie.

796
00:51:59,175 --> 00:52:00,342
Take a moment,

797
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:04,574
have a think, remember
the name of the game's

798
00:52:04,575 --> 00:52:06,658
where's my fucking money?

799
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:12,514
When I come back, we're gonna play.

800
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:30,848
- You Tom?

801
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:33,084
- Who are you?

802
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:34,868
- The game is on.

803
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:36,508
Wanna put your stuff away?

804
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:38,365
- No, I'm okay.

805
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:40,358
- Put that shit in your hotel.

806
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:43,359
Don't be taking stolen
goods to Rob's place.

807
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,527
He'll put your head in a fucking vice.

808
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:51,588
- It's called a nomad game,

809
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,457
different place every week.

810
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:55,697
Very high stakes.

811
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:57,228
The only way in is to have
the right phone number,

812
00:54:57,229 --> 00:54:58,767
which we now have,

813
00:54:58,768 --> 00:55:00,358
thanks to Joe.

814
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:01,692
- Thanks to Joe.

815
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:04,247
- This thing is started at 50 grand,

816
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:05,697
just to sit down.

817
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:07,468
And Joe never had the money.

818
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,857
Too rich for his blood.

819
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:13,028
What matters now, is that
this game is serious money.

820
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:15,076
And these are serious people.

821
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,564
Now we'll need all three
of us to pack it off.

822
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,398
- How?

823
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,695
- Cooler.

824
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:22,385
There's a sent in dealer,
but they offer a cut.

825
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,044
The deck is wide open
for about two seconds

826
00:55:24,045 --> 00:55:25,545
before every deal.

827
00:55:26,837 --> 00:55:27,975
- You've been?

828
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:28,976
- Twice.

829
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,945
Imran'll will play the
, I'll take the money,

830
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,245
and you're in the bag move.

831
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:36,845
- What? No, I can't do that.

832
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:39,303
- You deal the basement, right?

833
00:55:39,304 --> 00:55:41,204
Cold deck's the same thing.

834
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:44,529
Just 52 times easier to get caught.

835
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,819
- I'm serious, I can't.

836
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,468
- Give me those.

837
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:49,469
Come on.

838
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:53,458
This might not be strictly legal,

839
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:01,731
but effective.

840
00:56:01,732 --> 00:56:03,299
- Ho, ho.

841
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,300
Fuck me.

842
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,339
- This, I can teach.

843
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,173
Learn it and you don't
piss away all my money.

844
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:12,923
- How long have I got?

845
00:56:12,924 --> 00:56:14,610
- Six days.

846
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:16,681
And if it's not perfect by then,

847
00:56:16,682 --> 00:56:18,243
we're all dead.

848
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:19,318
- I don't like it over.

849
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:20,241
We could re a month.

850
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:21,760
- No, I'm already in.

851
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,424
I happen to know two seats
that are likely to open up.

852
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,507
We have to do it now.

853
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:25,591
You up to it?

854
00:56:28,129 --> 00:56:30,440
The one I'm buying is 35 grand,

855
00:56:30,441 --> 00:56:32,848
I'm going with more, and on 40,

856
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:34,120
you sell at five.

857
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:36,350
- Won't that look,

858
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,060
going in with the middle.

859
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,151
- That's 35 of my money.

860
00:56:40,152 --> 00:56:42,079
Now, you want to top
off with pocket change,

861
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,620
be my guest.

862
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:46,282
Just don't fucking lose it
before we get our chance.

863
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:48,770
You get knocked out before the big switch,

864
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:51,688
I'll shoot you in the fucking face.

865
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,362
Now you may have brought this score,

866
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:59,778
but let's keep it as coming
out of my pocket, you get me?

867
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:01,468
- He gets it.

868
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:03,028
- Then get to work.

869
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:07,176
In five days, you need to be
rod the hot with this thing.

870
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:08,264
Take him to Slayer's.

871
00:57:08,265 --> 00:57:10,536
Suit, shoes, the works.

872
00:57:10,537 --> 00:57:11,805
He'll look money.

873
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:12,806
I'll see to that.

874
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:15,416
Now you can't polish a turd,

875
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:18,000
but you can roll it in glitter.

876
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:30,208
Keep him hot.

877
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:44,826
- Before we get started ladies,

878
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:48,173
I think I should explain
some of the rules.

879
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,528
One of you is gonna do the talking,

880
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:51,862
while the other, you'll see.

881
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:55,474
In my extensive experience,

882
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,734
people can't really
think straight you know,

883
00:57:57,735 --> 00:58:00,800
through the pain, so I
tend to feel for lettin'

884
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:02,180
one of you deal with that,

885
00:58:02,181 --> 00:58:05,081
while the other decides when to talk.

886
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,082
Motivation,

887
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,479
of course this was a foul assignment,

888
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,122
though others would
take no time at all but

889
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:13,373
you two jokers,

890
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:18,044
you kept the loot in
that one fucking night.

891
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:21,804
Better start.

892
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:25,228
Eenie, meenie,

893
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,110
minie.

894
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:29,103
Good enough.

895
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:33,427
What do you want?

896
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:34,506
- You don't need to do this.

897
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:35,507
Enough.

898
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:38,336
- I ask questions, you give answers.

899
00:58:38,337 --> 00:58:40,690
Although he answers, he shows,

900
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:43,552
if you lie or hold out on me,

901
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:44,720
same old time.

902
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:47,457
You got that big boy?

903
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:00,382
- Hello.

904
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,224
Yeah, I got this number from Tom Shepherd.

905
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:09,384
That's correct, yeah.

906
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:14,384
Yeah, I am available on that day.

907
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:19,424
Yeah, I'm aware of the stakes.

908
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,705
My name, it's Thomas Dennis.

909
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,391
Okay?

910
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:56,683
- Okay, I'll go in first.

911
01:00:56,684 --> 01:00:59,142
Wait a few minutes, then follow me.

912
01:00:59,143 --> 01:01:00,243
If things go wrong, don't forget,

913
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:02,531
we don't know each other, okay?

914
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:04,523
How's the move.

915
01:01:04,524 --> 01:01:05,524
- Run hop.

916
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,538
- Show me then.

917
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:13,886
Good, now glove box.

918
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:21,999
There is 35,000.

919
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,833
Just give 'em the envelope,

920
01:01:22,834 --> 01:01:25,750
we don't give 'em cash in the open.

921
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:30,948
I know you're trying to con me.

922
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:31,949
I know it.

923
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:35,836
I've not figured it out yet, but I know.

924
01:01:35,837 --> 01:01:38,079
Shit, I'd be disappointed if you weren't.

925
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:38,913
- That.

926
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:42,498
- Just don't fuck this up tonight, okay?

927
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:45,276
I've waited too long to get in this game.

928
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:46,582
That envelope, you take it, run with it,

929
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,492
if that's what you want.

930
01:01:48,493 --> 01:01:51,391
Just don't go in there
tonight and fuck this up.

931
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:53,246
Hey, I'm a 100 grand up
in my balls in this shit,

932
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,582
but I understand it being over the table.

933
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,333
So if you're coming, come to win.

934
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,739
- Mister Shepherd sent me.

935
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,210
- Welcome to the nomad.

936
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:55,599
- He says, that lying motherfucker,

937
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,767
you've been bent off the
way we steal it last time.

938
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:07,120
Who's the kid here?

939
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:09,901
Did they check your age
before they let you in?

940
01:04:09,902 --> 01:04:11,985
- No, I've got a fake ID.

941
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:21,414
I made it myself, it's a good one.

942
01:04:26,222 --> 01:04:29,555
- Gentlemen, if we're ready, let's play.

943
01:05:09,304 --> 01:05:10,304
- Bathroom.

944
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:23,356
What the fuck were you thinking?

945
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:24,190
- It's a good hand.

946
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:25,925
- It was only one hand.

947
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:27,154
Now go back in there,

948
01:05:27,155 --> 01:05:28,094
stack the deck.

949
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,864
I'll take over and run
the next couple of rounds,

950
01:05:29,865 --> 01:05:31,325
and we'll roll over everyone.

951
01:05:31,326 --> 01:05:33,192
You make a switch from the bottom cards.

952
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:34,311
- Stack it now.

953
01:05:34,312 --> 01:05:35,145
But I don't get to cut

954
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:35,978
for another four or five rounds.

955
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:39,811
- You'll know of a finger
fucking bottom card.

956
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,377
- Enjoy myself, huh?

957
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,983
This is the worst damn
luck I've had all year.

958
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:13,521
We could lose the action.

959
01:06:13,522 --> 01:06:17,272
You should drink more,
and let me get better.

960
01:06:32,663 --> 01:06:33,663
Please.

961
01:06:57,492 --> 01:07:00,011
- Now that was a hand.

962
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:01,321
- Stop.

963
01:07:01,322 --> 01:07:02,405
Fucking stop.

964
01:07:04,202 --> 01:07:08,032
I see, that's one hell of a
fucking hand you had there.

965
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:08,935
- My time I guess.

966
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:11,083
- Wait, take your hands
off those fucking chips.

967
01:07:11,084 --> 01:07:12,815
You're fucking Tom?

968
01:07:12,816 --> 01:07:13,649
- Jackie.

969
01:07:13,649 --> 01:07:14,482
- Don't fucking Jackie me.

970
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:16,471
What's his fucking bullshit?

971
01:07:16,472 --> 01:07:18,322
Put down those fucking chips.

972
01:07:18,323 --> 01:07:19,625
- You've been on a run of late.

973
01:07:19,626 --> 01:07:20,865
Last week too.

974
01:07:20,866 --> 01:07:23,403
Like I said, it's my turn.

975
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:27,571
- And like I said, don't
touch those fucking chips.

976
01:07:29,444 --> 01:07:31,655
No this hand's fucked.

977
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:34,845
After he changed on this,
this prick cuts aceys.

978
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:37,906
- You have two kings, he has ace-king.

979
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:40,477
I don't see the problem Jackie.

980
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:42,364
- What is the problem?

981
01:07:42,365 --> 01:07:45,404
What is it you see that we don't?

982
01:07:45,405 --> 01:07:47,506
You think I cheated?

983
01:07:47,507 --> 01:07:50,090
Okay, how the hell did I cheat?

984
01:07:51,795 --> 01:07:52,795
He do it?

985
01:07:53,867 --> 01:07:54,867
Or him?

986
01:07:55,803 --> 01:07:56,895
Or did I rub a fucking lamp

987
01:07:56,896 --> 01:07:59,404
and wish or a good hand?

988
01:07:59,405 --> 01:08:00,946
- You know what I'm talking about.

989
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:04,895
- No, you know what you're talking about.

990
01:08:04,896 --> 01:08:07,229
Why don't you tell everyone?

991
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,413
Hell with this.

992
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:18,794
I'd like to cash out please.

993
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,773
- Fuck that, you just took over.

994
01:08:20,774 --> 01:08:22,221
- I think now will be fine,

995
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:23,862
given the situation.

996
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:26,532
Jackie, I think you
should stay at the table.

997
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:28,700
- You don't know who I am.

998
01:08:30,784 --> 01:08:32,464
Gonna find out.

999
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:34,298
- Jackie, please, sit.

1000
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:37,229
- Gentlemen.

1001
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,230
Pleasure.

1002
01:09:14,018 --> 01:09:15,287
- Fuck, that was awesome.

1003
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:16,121
- What are you doing?

1004
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:16,954
- What?

1005
01:09:16,955 --> 01:09:18,028
- You're supposed to fucking wait.

1006
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,619
- That's some shit,
that guy's fucking nuts.

1007
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,721
- You're supposed to fucking
wait, if you need to get.

1008
01:09:23,722 --> 01:09:24,972
He just pulled something, get in the car.

1009
01:09:24,973 --> 01:09:25,806
- No, but I can.

1010
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:28,252
- Get in the fucking car.

1011
01:10:09,093 --> 01:10:10,572
- I'm sorry I didn't even think.

1012
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,240
- I know you didn't.

1013
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:15,176
- We got the money.

1014
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:19,511
I guess we can't go back.

1015
01:10:19,512 --> 01:10:23,410
- You've doubled that
deal, that's for sure.

1016
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:25,511
- Did I fuck it up?

1017
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:28,061
- No, he was too fast, that's all.

1018
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:31,312
- How did he know we switched the deck?

1019
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,650
- How did he know?

1020
01:10:34,552 --> 01:10:36,149
Let me see the cards.

1021
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,317
The ones you switched out.

1022
01:10:48,931 --> 01:10:49,931
Shit.

1023
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:52,661
He did know.

1024
01:10:52,662 --> 01:10:53,728
- No, I swear, he didn't see a thing.

1025
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:55,250
No one saw it.

1026
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,551
- No, but he did after it
was already done, it's paper,

1027
01:10:57,552 --> 01:10:58,552
the mount.

1028
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:02,675
So your stick, professional,
takes months of practice,

1029
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,344
you're out of luck.

1030
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:05,206
- So it's a clip joint?

1031
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,205
- No, just Jackie.

1032
01:11:07,206 --> 01:11:08,039
You were stepping on his scam,

1033
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,107
that's why he didn't say anything.

1034
01:11:10,108 --> 01:11:12,155
Prick's probably got every
deck in the house painted,

1035
01:11:12,156 --> 01:11:14,827
and half the dealers in his pocket.

1036
01:11:14,828 --> 01:11:16,075
That's how we knew we switched decks.

1037
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:17,717
The fucking marks disappeared.

1038
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:19,237
- So that's why that
dealer with the one eyebrow

1039
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:20,738
was staring at me.

1040
01:11:22,688 --> 01:11:23,576
Then we're in the clear.

1041
01:11:23,577 --> 01:11:25,183
- We're fucked.

1042
01:11:25,184 --> 01:11:26,017
We just called out one

1043
01:11:26,018 --> 01:11:27,634
of the most dangerous guys in Glasgow.

1044
01:11:27,635 --> 01:11:30,052
You think he'll tear that up?

1045
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,394
- So what do we do?

1046
01:11:34,395 --> 01:11:37,312
- There's only one thing we can do.

1047
01:11:56,406 --> 01:11:57,553
Light out tomorrow.

1048
01:11:57,554 --> 01:12:00,074
Take the ferry or the train.

1049
01:12:00,075 --> 01:12:02,514
Buses are good too, but
don't go to the airport.

1050
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:03,634
- What about the money?

1051
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:06,383
- We're gonna need a
fixer, negotiate something.

1052
01:12:06,384 --> 01:12:09,685
After that, we'll chop up what's left.

1053
01:12:09,686 --> 01:12:10,519
Where will you go?

1054
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,413
Back to London?

1055
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:13,914
- Ireland, family.

1056
01:12:14,766 --> 01:12:16,171
If they'll have me.

1057
01:12:16,172 --> 01:12:17,422
A month, maybe.

1058
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:21,183
- You did well tonight.

1059
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:24,413
Until you almost got us killed.

1060
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:25,414
- Sorry.

1061
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,431
- You're green, but you're good.

1062
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:29,432
I can tell.

1063
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:33,911
- Can I ask you a favor?

1064
01:12:33,912 --> 01:12:35,141
- You're fucking serious?

1065
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,725
- Yeah, just wait, two minutes?

1066
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,828
Can you hold on to this for me?

1067
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:16,662
- Why it's yours Tom.

1068
01:13:16,663 --> 01:13:18,948
- I've got 12,000 pounds
and Euros in here,

1069
01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:22,167
and a few personal belongings,
and my granddad's watch.

1070
01:13:22,168 --> 01:13:26,308
Like you said, I got to
take care of my stash.

1071
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:28,679
I'd take it with me,
but I might lose it all.

1072
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,680
- 12?

1073
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:33,060
- I captured this, to keep me going.

1074
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:33,894
I wouldn't ask,

1075
01:13:33,895 --> 01:13:38,060
but it's everything I've got in the world.

1076
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,471
- Put it in the back, with the money.

1077
01:13:39,472 --> 01:13:40,472
- Yeah?

1078
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:53,225
- The man's no.

1079
01:13:53,226 --> 01:13:55,323
This is gonna get nasty.

1080
01:13:55,324 --> 01:13:58,083
Hey, don't come back unless
you hear from me, all right?

1081
01:13:58,084 --> 01:14:00,094
You're sure you want me to bank that?

1082
01:14:00,095 --> 01:14:02,403
- That way you know I'm coming back.

1083
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:03,571
- Fair enough.

1084
01:15:53,519 --> 01:15:56,352
- Come on, you can do it, come on!

1085
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,907
Come on you can do it.

1086
01:15:59,908 --> 01:16:00,908
- All right.

1087
01:16:02,028 --> 01:16:03,028
Oh fuck off.

1088
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,387
It's all been chopped.

1089
01:16:08,388 --> 01:16:10,388
I've got 60, 70 is mine.

1090
01:16:12,148 --> 01:16:14,027
- Well, that's a good start.

1091
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,660
That could even make it.

1092
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:17,632
- It's at the house.

1093
01:16:17,633 --> 01:16:19,071
- No it fuckin' hasn't.

1094
01:16:19,072 --> 01:16:21,719
Or have you been in the fucking game?

1095
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,127
- One house, in the watch shop.

1096
01:16:24,128 --> 01:16:26,628
Under the bench, in the floor.

1097
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:32,634
- Geez, they looked in the fucking shed.

1098
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,910
You ladies will take.

1099
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:41,446
- Hey, stay with me.

1100
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:43,708
Tom, stay with me.

1101
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:45,655
You'll hear when he comes back.

1102
01:16:45,656 --> 01:16:47,205
Even if he affects us.

1103
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:48,789
He just affects us.

1104
01:16:50,098 --> 01:16:51,431
I've got a plan.

1105
01:16:59,933 --> 01:17:01,350
- Wakey.

1106
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:06,301
It turns out you did know
how to tell the truth.

1107
01:17:06,302 --> 01:17:07,302
60,000.

1108
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:09,212
Not bad.

1109
01:17:10,483 --> 01:17:12,973
Not even close to square.

1110
01:17:12,974 --> 01:17:14,672
I can get more.

1111
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:26,658
- And I'm done with this guy.

1112
01:17:27,671 --> 01:17:29,339
Where have you got your winnings?

1113
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,840
This guy's got his.

1114
01:17:30,841 --> 01:17:33,550
A car, fancy watch, and the suit.

1115
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:34,551
You,

1116
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,203
you've got nothin'.

1117
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:39,795
I may have to pin the both of you cunts.

1118
01:17:39,796 --> 01:17:41,129
See the problem?

1119
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,955
It might work, he's getting winced.

1120
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:55,710
- No, wait wait.

1121
01:18:00,457 --> 01:18:02,207
I don't have nothin'.

1122
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:11,387
- That's what you call a double negative.

1123
01:18:11,388 --> 01:18:12,627
If I don't have nothin',

1124
01:18:12,628 --> 01:18:14,536
if you don't have nothin',

1125
01:18:14,537 --> 01:18:16,117
you must have somethin'.

1126
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:16,951
- What?

1127
01:18:16,952 --> 01:18:18,907
- If you don't have nothin',
you must have somethin'.

1128
01:18:18,908 --> 01:18:21,664
If you don't have nothin',
you must have somethin',

1129
01:18:21,665 --> 01:18:22,665
yes, I know.

1130
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:26,027
- I have something.

1131
01:18:26,028 --> 01:18:27,765
- Ah, that's a point.

1132
01:18:27,766 --> 01:18:30,016
Unless you're bullshitting.

1133
01:18:31,926 --> 01:18:32,926
What is it?

1134
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:37,083
- I know where he keeps
his money, his real money.

1135
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:38,053
- That wasn't his real money.

1136
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:40,104
- No no, the money he
gave you is just a front.

1137
01:18:40,105 --> 01:18:42,192
He's got a lot more somewhere else.

1138
01:18:42,193 --> 01:18:43,803
- And you know where?

1139
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:46,221
- In my phone I can show you.

1140
01:18:51,025 --> 01:18:53,192
- Curiouser and curiouser.

1141
01:19:07,335 --> 01:19:09,252
- You said it yourself.

1142
01:19:19,313 --> 01:19:20,313
- Where?

1143
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:24,118
- There's an app.

1144
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:26,176
No, last page.

1145
01:19:27,312 --> 01:19:28,791
That one.

1146
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:30,884
I gave him my bag, there
was a transmitter inside.

1147
01:19:30,885 --> 01:19:31,872
- And that's
where he keeps his money?

1148
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:32,705
- Yeah.

1149
01:19:32,705 --> 01:19:33,538
- Just the fucking house.

1150
01:19:33,538 --> 01:19:34,415
You sure this is at?

1151
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:36,000
- There, her name is Cara.

1152
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:37,160
It's her house.

1153
01:19:37,161 --> 01:19:41,328
- It will only be.

1154
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,562
I won't hit you then.

1155
01:20:13,303 --> 01:20:14,793
Good news.

1156
01:20:14,794 --> 01:20:16,273
Found the bag.

1157
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:18,481
And now what will I do?

1158
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:21,003
House belongs to some woman.

1159
01:20:21,004 --> 01:20:22,342
She wasn't there.

1160
01:20:22,343 --> 01:20:24,258
In fact, nothing was there.

1161
01:20:24,259 --> 01:20:25,539
That's the bad news.

1162
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,373
You know what that means.

1163
01:20:26,373 --> 01:20:27,206
- No no, no!

1164
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:28,206
No!

1165
01:20:32,052 --> 01:20:33,052
Help!

1166
01:20:34,402 --> 01:20:35,402
Fuck.

1167
01:20:37,311 --> 01:20:38,600
No, no.

1168
01:20:38,601 --> 01:20:39,601
Please.

1169
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:48,809
- Do you have any fucking doubts?

1170
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:49,681
- Please, please.

1171
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:50,551
- I'm done waiting.

1172
01:20:50,552 --> 01:20:52,142
I've got shit to do.
- I'm sorry.

1173
01:20:52,143 --> 01:20:53,872
- I don't need your fucking sorry.

1174
01:20:53,873 --> 01:20:55,294
Let's give you a hit.

1175
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:57,462
- No, wait wait wait wait.

1176
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,150
There's a van,

1177
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:07,273
in longterm parking.

1178
01:21:07,274 --> 01:21:08,331
- I don't do.

1179
01:21:08,332 --> 01:21:10,472
Where's my fucking money?

1180
01:21:10,473 --> 01:21:11,982
- Inside.

1181
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:14,059
- My money's inside the van?

1182
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,301
- Mine, my money,

1183
01:21:16,302 --> 01:21:18,072
is in the van.

1184
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,073
- How much?

1185
01:21:20,233 --> 01:21:21,233
- A lot.

1186
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,900
More than mister jelly donut over there?

1187
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:26,901
- Uh, a lot.

1188
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:33,195
- Okay, I'm gonna give you one last try.

1189
01:21:34,622 --> 01:21:37,720
If you waste my time I'm
gonna start on your feet,

1190
01:21:37,721 --> 01:21:39,250
turn you into chopped beef.

1191
01:21:39,251 --> 01:21:40,501
You understand?

1192
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:44,045
I'm gonna ask once.

1193
01:21:45,262 --> 01:21:46,262
Ready?

1194
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:48,982
Where?

1195
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,916
- Walton Street.

1196
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,250
It's floorage there.

1197
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:02,863
It's a bag.

1198
01:22:05,014 --> 01:22:06,347
Under the floor.

1199
01:22:07,545 --> 01:22:09,212
- How much?

1200
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,633
- Everything.

1201
01:22:14,073 --> 01:22:15,073
- Good boy.

1202
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:09,237
- Hello, morning sunshine.

1203
01:24:12,073 --> 01:24:13,240
Best be going.

1204
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:16,879
Nothing personal son but,

1205
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,297
nice fuckin' ya.

1206
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,032
You may want to wipe your asshole.

1207
01:24:22,033 --> 01:24:24,249
Sorry about that.

1208
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:27,582
- See you in the morning Jackie.

1209
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,833
- We all hit it too.

1210
01:24:36,967 --> 01:24:39,384
- Nice try, you little prick.

1211
01:24:43,775 --> 01:24:46,817
- You want me to make that call?

1212
01:24:46,818 --> 01:24:47,985
- Thanks Cara.

1213
01:25:24,936 --> 01:25:26,269
Stings don't it?

1214
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:36,999
- How did you know?

1215
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:40,972
- Which part?

1216
01:25:41,829 --> 01:25:42,829
- What?

1217
01:25:46,437 --> 01:25:49,005
- That you were going after my money?

1218
01:25:49,006 --> 01:25:52,256
Or that you killed the old man for his?

1219
01:26:02,918 --> 01:26:03,918
Joe told me.

1220
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,563
- Joe's dead.

1221
01:26:08,878 --> 01:26:09,961
- Aye, he is.

1222
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:14,087
But he sent a message.

1223
01:26:14,088 --> 01:26:15,505
Special delivery.

1224
01:26:16,517 --> 01:26:18,055
- How?

1225
01:26:18,056 --> 01:26:19,723
- You gave it to me.

1226
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:23,480
- The game?
- The game.

1227
01:26:25,909 --> 01:26:26,992
- Nomad game.

1228
01:26:27,968 --> 01:26:29,148
The game that everybody wants in,

1229
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:30,737
but only if you have the right number.

1230
01:26:30,738 --> 01:26:31,857
- My number was good.

1231
01:26:31,858 --> 01:26:33,525
- It's my game, Tom.

1232
01:26:34,938 --> 01:26:35,938
It's mine.

1233
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:39,868
Been running it for years,

1234
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:43,788
a rolling clip joint
for high stakes suckers.

1235
01:26:43,789 --> 01:26:45,956
Every seat loaded but one.

1236
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:48,119
Grifters from all over the country

1237
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,790
bring fresh meat into town
for a fair cut of the action.

1238
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:53,291
Grifters like you.

1239
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:57,231
- Clever.

1240
01:26:58,212 --> 01:26:59,462
Clever old man.

1241
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:05,337
- When you told me about his big score,

1242
01:27:05,338 --> 01:27:07,728
A game that I'm sure he knew was mine.

1243
01:27:07,729 --> 01:27:08,729
Well,

1244
01:27:09,881 --> 01:27:12,548
message received and understood.

1245
01:27:13,868 --> 01:27:15,574
- You knew I had the money.

1246
01:27:15,575 --> 01:27:17,627
- After I went to London,

1247
01:27:17,628 --> 01:27:19,628
after I saw the old man.

1248
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:22,646
I checked his hold out.

1249
01:27:22,647 --> 01:27:25,985
The first thing he'd give up in a pinch.

1250
01:27:25,986 --> 01:27:26,986
Untouched.

1251
01:27:29,346 --> 01:27:31,013
But his bank, empty.

1252
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,185
Someone got close enough to figure out

1253
01:27:40,186 --> 01:27:42,393
the old man's stash,

1254
01:27:42,394 --> 01:27:44,144
but not his hold out.

1255
01:27:45,965 --> 01:27:47,715
Somehow you found it.

1256
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:55,224
And you had to kill him.

1257
01:28:00,829 --> 01:28:04,579
Make it look like a bag,
or something random.

1258
01:28:07,373 --> 01:28:09,706
Beating an old man to death.

1259
01:28:12,445 --> 01:28:14,062
Somewhere I know that I'm guessing

1260
01:28:14,063 --> 01:28:17,537
Joe tries to bargain for his life.

1261
01:28:17,538 --> 01:28:20,205
But then he knows what's coming.

1262
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,728
So he tells you about his big score.

1263
01:28:24,729 --> 01:28:26,812
Gives you a phone number.

1264
01:28:27,819 --> 01:28:28,986
Golden ticket.

1265
01:28:32,299 --> 01:28:35,466
Then you finished the job you started.

1266
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,903
The one thing I couldn't figure out,

1267
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:47,904
how you knew where he kept his bank.

1268
01:28:49,563 --> 01:28:51,802
You had to trick it out of him,

1269
01:28:51,803 --> 01:28:53,136
and no idea how.

1270
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:57,480
Until you gave me that fucking bag.

1271
01:29:05,102 --> 01:29:06,732
- Nothing personal.

1272
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:08,450
- You think?

1273
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:10,534
- All this, torture room,

1274
01:29:11,962 --> 01:29:14,212
hammer, just for the money.

1275
01:29:16,224 --> 01:29:18,431
- A lot of money.

1276
01:29:18,432 --> 01:29:20,420
More than we expected even.

1277
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:22,838
A lot more than Joe ever had.

1278
01:29:25,272 --> 01:29:28,522
How many grifters have you ripped into?

1279
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:33,359
- You could have just beat it out of me.

1280
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,693
- Joe deserved better.

1281
01:29:37,592 --> 01:29:39,425
- The con was the con.

1282
01:29:44,056 --> 01:29:46,543
- You ever see The Sting?

1283
01:29:46,544 --> 01:29:48,255
The film, The Sting?

1284
01:29:48,256 --> 01:29:49,256
- No.

1285
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:54,056
- Two con men, Hooker and Gondorff.

1286
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:56,856
Robert Redford, Paul Newman.

1287
01:29:56,857 --> 01:29:58,997
This big-time mobster,
a real dangerous guy,

1288
01:29:58,998 --> 01:30:02,245
kills their old man, their Joe.

1289
01:30:02,246 --> 01:30:05,083
So, they put together a big crew of guys,

1290
01:30:05,084 --> 01:30:07,953
guys who cared about the old man.

1291
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:10,103
All they're ever gonna get is money.

1292
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,687
A lot of money, but that's all.

1293
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:17,263
So, Paul Newman says to
Robert Redford something like,

1294
01:30:17,264 --> 01:30:18,733
why are you doing this?

1295
01:30:18,734 --> 01:30:19,802
And you know, just for a bunch of cash.

1296
01:30:19,803 --> 01:30:21,604
What the fuck is that in return for?

1297
01:30:21,605 --> 01:30:24,399
Killing a friend, right?

1298
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,599
And Redford says,

1299
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,016
this is my favorite
line in the whole film.

1300
01:30:29,017 --> 01:30:30,100
Redford says,

1301
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:35,156
because I don't know enough
about killing to kill him.

1302
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:42,549
Of course,

1303
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,940
it's just a movie.
