1
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,000
Make it stop.

2
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,310
Make it stop.

3
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:13,137
Sir, is there
anyone else in here?

4
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,482
Is there anyone
else in here, sir?

5
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:29,068
Let's get you outta here.

6
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:18,000
It was a accident,
a horrible accident.

7
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,275
And I'm sorry,

8
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,965
but we should consider
the event's consequences.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,344
Wait, you said
there were no charges.

10
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,275
Yeah, I mean, maybe
some civil cases

11
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,689
from other tenants
in the building,

12
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,241
but nothing, nothing criminal.

13
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,068
The report says arson.

14
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,827
The report also says that
Thomas is not a suspect.

15
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,896
But he could have died?

16
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,413
Two people did die.

17
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,930
Your brother will need to
recover physically and mentally.

18
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,413
Tekiah was so beautiful.

19
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:43,896
And the baby...

20
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,965
There will be consequences
that will affect

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,965
his well-being once
his memory sets in.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,241
What do you mean?

23
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:55,000
Guilt, grief and
responsibility.

24
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:56,689
Sometimes they're
deadly as cancer.

25
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:57,724
What is this?

26
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,793
A possible solution
for Thomas's future.

27
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,275
Is this safe?

28
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,517
Perfectly.

29
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:23,034
So you see, it's a
simple procedure.

30
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,000
I present to you the
first human application

31
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,275
of the Envision implant.

32
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,034
Thank you.

33
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,241
Any questions?

34
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,665
What will
control the visual images

35
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:35,689
of the subject?

36
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:39,206
Subconscious
need, desire, and emotion.

37
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:41,827
They're intertwined with the
reality of the physical world,

38
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:44,172
enhancing his experience.

39
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:46,724
It is based
on dream resourcing?

40
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:52,000
Like a waking
dream, secondary to reality.

41
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,344
With medicine and
ongoing counseling,

42
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,827
we'll be able to steer the
patient towards contentment.

43
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:00,172
His memories?

44
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:02,344
The worst are removed

45
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,068
with chemically-induced amnesia.

46
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:07,689
He'll create new and
less painful ones.

47
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,448
This is
theoretical though, right?

48
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:12,172
Thanks
to Mr. Shepherd,

49
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,000
theory becomes practice.

50
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,724
He will show the world the
true value of Envision.

51
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,447
Around and around we go.

52
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,379
Where we'll stop, nobody knows.

53
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on, Iris.

54
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,182
Don't tell
me you're getting old

55
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:31,068
on me already, old man.

56
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,862
No, I just have to work.

57
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:35,344
You don't have to work.

58
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,275
Well, I don't
have time for this.

59
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,689
What if we're
stuck in here forever

60
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:43,413
and we could only look at each
other through the glass...

61
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:47,103
- Okay.
- But never touch.

62
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,137
But we're not.

63
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,068
Yeah, but what if we were?

64
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:52,103
I don't know.

65
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:53,551
It would be a terrible waste.

66
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,034
Why?

67
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,379
I don't have time for this.

68
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,724
Tell me.

69
00:04:57,758 --> 00:04:59,758
Why would it be a waste?

70
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:01,344
Because I don't
like to browse.

71
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,482
It would be torture, a waste.

72
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,896
You think looking
at me for an eternity

73
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,034
would be torture?

74
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,310
I mean, yeah,
if we couldn't...

75
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:16,758
- It's all in your head.
- Touch isn't.

76
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,827
Yeah, well, you
could always touch yourself

77
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,206
and I could...
Look, look, look.

78
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,137
Masturbation lacks the
element of surprise.

79
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:29,137
Come on, I gotta go.

80
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, kiss
me, then you could go.

81
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:33,389
Iris, come on,
Iris, Iris, please.

82
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,137
People are watching.
Exactly.

83
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,689
Don't disappoint them.

84
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,344
All right, there, there.

85
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,068
Can we go?

86
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:41,896
Can we go?

87
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:43,103
Come on, come on.

88
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:47,068
If you really, really want to.

89
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,103
This ain't even fair.

90
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:48,931
You so cute.

91
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:49,758
This, this ain't right.

92
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:52,448
This...

93
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,148
Well, look, we definitely
got some bills to pay.

94
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,758
I, I seriously gotta go.

95
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,241
Look at you,
my little sellout.

96
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,241
Always so responsible.

97
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,068
Now what would I do without you?

98
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,689
Only you would think earning
a living is selling out.

99
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,862
What, this guy again?

100
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,689
Man, what is he doing now?

101
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,148
Well, it looks
like he's blocking the doorway

102
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,586
and talking to himself.

103
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,103
Oh, where you going?

104
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,413
To clear the doorway.

105
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,103
So his memories are returning?

106
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:32,275
No, but he was been
a bit strange, though.

107
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,172
He has conversations with
people that only he can see.

108
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:37,413
He doesn't seem happy.

109
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,206
Perhaps
there's a subconscious need

110
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:42,034
to connect with
his wife and child.

111
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,241
I mean, these last couple
years have been real,

112
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,862
real rough on us, Doc.

113
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:47,079
Shouldn't we be concentrating

114
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:48,000
on Thomas's well-being?

115
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,344
Well, that's why we're here.

116
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,965
We had our firm draw
up these papers for you.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,758
We want the
procedure reversed.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,034
It's worked perfectly.

119
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,275
He's living a full life.

120
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,137
He spends too much
time in his own world.

121
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,655
Yeah, he's livin' a lie.

122
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,896
Perhaps the truth is worse.

123
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,551
This is not working.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,379
The legal order's been
served and come on, baby.

125
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,172
She's still in defib.

126
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:25,137
Damn it.

127
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,103
Come on, Iris.

128
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:28,310
Give us some help here, huh?

129
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:33,275
Nothing.

130
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,827
I just don't, I just don't
understand what's goin' on.

131
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:49,034
- I, I'm sorry, she's gone.
- No.

132
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:55,965
No, nah, this, we,
this isn't happening.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,586
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:05,655
Nah, nah, she's not dead.

135
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:08,655
Sir, where are you going?

136
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,551
You shouldn't be
alone right now.

137
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:16,517
I just wish that
we could've met her.

138
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:21,724
Yeah, Jackie, you
would've loved her.

139
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:23,586
She was so funny.

140
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,517
Now how are you
really doing, anyways?

141
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:31,724
Like if you need anything,
we got you, okay?

142
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,413
Yeah, well, I think
I'm fine, thanks, though.

143
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,309
Hey, Jackie, you tell 'em yet?

144
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:38,793
- Not now, Larry.
- Tell me what?

145
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:40,275
If not now, then when?

146
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,068
- What?
- Not now.

147
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:44,689
Look like you'll
be an uncle, buddy.

148
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,068
Jesus, Larry, really?

149
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,310
- What?
- I'm sorry.

150
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,344
Oh, you, you're
really pregnant?

151
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:52,517
See?

152
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:54,389
I mean, my brother's going
through so much right now.

153
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:56,793
Do you really think that he
wants to hear our good news?

154
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,206
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm sorry, man.

155
00:08:58,241 --> 00:08:59,424
I forgot about that.
No, Larry.

156
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,758
No, no, it's fine.

157
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:01,931
I think it's pretty cool

158
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:04,551
and I'm really
happy for you guys.

159
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:06,965
Really?

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,907
Jackie, yes, you're
going to be a great mother.

161
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,586
See, I told you
he'd be happy for us.

162
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,172
Oh, shut up, Larry.

163
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:14,517
You can be so
insensitive sometimes.

164
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:19,241
Okay, actually, thank
y'all for the coffee.

165
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,586
I actually got somewhere to be.

166
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,275
Now, see, now
he's leaving, Larry.

167
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,620
See?
No, no, no, it's fine.

168
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:26,517
I really have somewhere to go.

169
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,379
Yeah, see, he got
somewhere to be.

170
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,275
You can't blame
everything on me.

171
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,320
Okay, but we really need

172
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,000
to have a conversation
later, okay?

173
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,310
All right, but
can you do it later?

174
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,689
Okay, are you really okay?

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,172
Yeah, it'll be all
good, but whatever.

176
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,758
I'm really happy for you guys.

177
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,000
I love you guys.

178
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,354
And I'll see you
later, all right?

179
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,655
- Okay.
- All right.

180
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,448
I'll see you, all right?
Okay.

181
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:50,206
All right, man.

182
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,413
All right, see you, Tom.

183
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:52,527
- All right, Larry.
- Love you.

184
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,620
Love you, Jack.

185
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,068
You are such an idiot.

186
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,379
You are such an idiot.

187
00:09:58,413 --> 00:09:59,862
Do you know what?

188
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,172
You know my brother.

189
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,482
He's a mess right now.

190
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,689
When has your brother
not been a mess?

191
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,344
You get on my nerves.

192
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,241
Still ain't get no eggs.

193
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:20,655
Yup, sleeping on
the couch tonight.

194
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,793
No, I don't know.

195
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:58,965
Do you?

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,620
Only if you want her to.

197
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:10,137
Look, I'm don't
want to be rude...

198
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,206
But there's always
a way around it.

199
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,310
Really?

200
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,655
Cause it looks like
you may be wrong.

201
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:20,068
But it's not too late for you.

202
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,379
She doesn't have to be gone.

203
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:30,655
I don't want your
card or your advice.

204
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,793
But you need
them both, Thomas.

205
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,344
How do you know my name?

206
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,620
And have you had any other
hallucinations recently?

207
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,655
- No.
- Can you see

208
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,551
the old woman right now?
No.

209
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,655
Do you think I'm going
crazy, Dr. Keller?

210
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,137
Well, under the circumstances,

211
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:01,379
I think what you experienced

212
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,862
was a perfectly normal reaction

213
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,137
to the loss of somebody special.

214
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:09,344
You said that this
old woman said...

215
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,068
She said she didn't
have to be gone.

216
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,586
She knew my name.
Right.

217
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,827
Well, what that tells me is
subconsciously you're still

218
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:21,379
in the denial stage,
searching for hope

219
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:23,655
or some strand of
Iris to cling to.

220
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,482
Well, I mean, I miss her.

221
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:28,620
Of course you do.

222
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:31,206
But the mind is a very
powerful, very mysterious place

223
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,310
and you need to be careful not
to lose touch with reality.

224
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:37,965
Iris is gone, Thomas,
and I think you need

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,379
to let her be gone
in order for you

226
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:41,482
to move forward in
a healthy fashion.

227
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:47,758
Yeah, I know.

228
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,068
Acceptance is our goal here.

229
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:51,655
That's what I can offer.

230
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,793
Whenever you're ready.

231
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,310
Oh, damn, it's closed, shit.

232
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,620
Tom?

233
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,931
Tom Shepherd?

234
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:18,275
Whoa, Tekiah, you look great.

235
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,137
Thanks, you look busy.

236
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,172
Good morning, Thomas.

237
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:44,379
You can go right in.

238
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,206
How do you know my name?

239
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,137
Everything will be explained

240
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:50,172
to you right after the analysis.

241
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,137
Analysis?

242
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:11,931
Welcome, Thomas Shepherd.

243
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,137
Please step forward carefully.

244
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:21,275
Hello?

245
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:24,689
Who is this?

246
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:27,034
Please carefully step forward.

247
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,862
Thomas Shepherd,
30-year-old male.

248
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:33,965
Current account
active for two years,

249
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,896
three months and 14 days.

250
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,379
Credit approved,
searching hard drive.

251
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,206
What is this?

252
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,586
What is this place?

253
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,931
Current status of Iris Mone,

254
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,206
terminated by Thomas Jefferson.

255
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,827
No, no, that's not true.

256
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,862
That's not right.

257
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:56,275
Hey, what is this place?

258
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,310
Screw this.

259
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,000
Please remain calm.

260
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,172
Please remain tranquil.

261
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:06,838
It's good to see
you, Mr. Shepherd.

262
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,379
I came here for some answers.

263
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,620
Okay, Mr. Shepherd, I
think it's very important

264
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,724
for you to know the
terms of our agreement,

265
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:18,448
that we usually don't reach out
to clients in such a manner,

266
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:21,034
but these are extraordinary
circumstances.

267
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,137
Your previous agreement
is null and void.

268
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,275
Null and void?

269
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,137
What the hell is this?

270
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,310
This is your contract.

271
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,724
I've never been here before.

272
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:35,758
No?

273
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,275
My life has been nothing

274
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,413
but positive since
I went to Envision.

275
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:43,172
I was depressed and
couldn't deal with life.

276
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,655
And then I contacted Envision
and my whole life changed.

277
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,482
Everything I ever wanted
is an imagination away.

278
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:52,517
I get all the best parts of
my life every single day.

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Mr. Shepherd, what we
do is provide a state

280
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,172
of conscious delusion.

281
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,241
Conscious, what?

282
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,551
Can you speak some English?

283
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:05,241
Okay, okay, fundamentally,
it involves you

284
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,275
opening your
imagination to the point

285
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,586
where fantasy and
reality can coexist.

286
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,586
You have one job in reality,

287
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,482
but in your mind you
have your dream job.

288
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:20,931
You can invent your
perfect life partner,

289
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,931
create opportunities
and your experiences.

290
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:26,586
We allow you to
customize your life,

291
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,793
guaranteeing success,
happiness and joy.

292
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,793
This is crazy.

293
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:34,689
This, this, this
isn't even possible.

294
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:38,034
Well, unfortunately,
due to legal reasons,

295
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:40,344
your experience
has come to an end.

296
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,413
What?

297
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,206
What experience are
you talking about?

298
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,448
Can you stop talking in code

299
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,827
and start clarifying
some things for me?

300
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:52,034
Okay, would you rather
be happy or aware?

301
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,275
Happy or aware?

302
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,793
What do you mean aware exactly?

303
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,310
Let me ask you a question.

304
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,172
What is it that you
think you do for a living?

305
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:08,103
I'm a writer.

306
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:09,689
I'm working on a novel.

307
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:11,103
- Really?
- Really.

308
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:19,448
Okay.

309
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,517
It's all right, Tom.

310
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:50,310
I'm not out there or in here.

311
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:55,206
I'm in here.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,586
So what do you want to
have with the salmon?

313
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:08,827
I don't know.

314
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:09,896
What you think?

315
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:11,172
I don't know.

316
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:13,310
Well, I was going to
make a little salad.

317
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:18,068
We could do like Brussels
sprouts or asparagus

318
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:21,000
or mashed potatoes or something?

319
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:29,275
Let's do the sprouts
with some mild select.

320
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,241
Okay.

321
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
We about to have a good night.

322
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:37,724
Oh, let's go.

323
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:08,379
How you open this shit?

324
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:10,448
How you open it?

325
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:12,172
Excuse me, sir.

326
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,103
You can't smoke in here.

327
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:16,827
Oh yeah?

328
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:18,965
You can't drink that, either.

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,448
And how do I even
know if you're real?

330
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:23,689
You ever thought
about that, huh?

331
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:28,931
Thank you, whoa, whoa, fellas,
fellas, whoa, whoa, fellas.

332
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:30,079
I'm just trying to get my drink.

333
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,620
Y'all gonna let them
do me like this?

334
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,655
Hold up, fellas.

335
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:35,551
Whoa, whoa, whoa, fellas.

336
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:36,769
Come on, man, y'all gonna
let them do me like.

337
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,206
No, I just want my beverage.

338
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:40,034
I just want my beverage.

339
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,182
I just want my beverage, man.

340
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,206
Man, let go of me.

341
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,103
I just want my beverage.

342
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,896
Is that too much to ask?

343
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,758
Man, you know what?

344
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:48,724
Get off me.

345
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,137
Y'all gonna tear my hand.

346
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:50,965
You know what?

347
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,206
You two are nothing.

348
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:54,034
Without me, you
wouldn't even exist.

349
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:57,000
I just want my drink, man.

350
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:59,586
No, let go of me.

351
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:03,551
Tom, time to go, man.

352
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,275
Nice digs, huh?

353
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,206
I feel like crap.

354
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:13,793
Yeah, I know, man.

355
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,068
Let's go, man.

356
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,503
I hate seeing you
in here like this.

357
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:20,172
I think this is
where I belong.

358
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,655
Why would you say that?

359
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,034
I think I've done some
pretty messed up things

360
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:28,034
that I can't even
fully remember.

361
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:29,758
Yeah, I mean you were drunk.

362
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,275
You trashed the liquor store.

363
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,137
Not cool, but I mean it's
definitely not anything.

364
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:35,275
No, no, no.

365
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,275
Not last night, Larry.

366
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,172
Over the last few years.

367
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:40,344
Yeah, Tom, listen...

368
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,758
Then I get a
visit from a doctor

369
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:43,482
from the Envision
Medical Project.

370
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:45,172
- What?
- Having these horrible,

371
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:48,000
painful flashes of memories.

372
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,286
I don't even know
what's real anymore.

373
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,689
What was the doctor's name?

374
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,758
- Faust, Dr. Faust.
- This bitch.

375
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:55,137
But like I, what?

376
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:57,517
You know her?

377
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:00,068
She's real?

378
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:01,137
Yeah, I know her.

379
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,965
Let's go, man.

380
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,655
Let's get out of here.

381
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,517
What's going on, Larry?

382
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:07,517
I'm not sure,

383
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,310
but I'm going to
check out a few things

384
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,344
and we're going to figure
this out, all right?

385
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:13,103
But for now, get
yourself cleaned up.

386
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:15,206
I brought you a
shirt, man, all right?

387
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:19,931
Everybody used to smoke.

388
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:22,275
Look, I don't know
what I am, honestly.

389
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,931
I'm just out of,
who's this Dr. Faust?

390
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,586
I'm thinking she's
part of this whole

391
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,000
fuzzy dream reality thing
I've been experiencing lately,

392
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:33,310
with these horrible feelings
and these flashbacks

393
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:34,976
and she's talking about
she's here to help me.

394
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,758
I'm going to look into
it for you. I got you.

395
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:38,586
All right, man.

396
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,275
Like whatever, man,

397
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,172
but thank you, Larry.
Yeah.

398
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:45,251
I don't know,
but thank you, man.

399
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,965
Like thank you for
coming down here,

400
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,103
but don't tell
Jackie about this.

401
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:51,241
- Nah, don't worry.
- Her being pregnant, just...

402
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:52,551
Don't worry about that.

403
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:53,586
Are you going to be okay?

404
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,103
I don't know, I don't know.

405
00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:59,068
I really just need to take
a walk, clear my head.

406
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:01,103
Just sort some things out.

407
00:25:02,103 --> 00:25:04,103
Hey, but if you
need to talk...

408
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:07,793
All right, man,
all right, yeah.

409
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,241
I'm out.
Damn.

410
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:22,517
Shit, shit.

411
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:39,620
What the?

412
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,620
Tom?

413
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:57,965
Mr. Campbell, good morning.

414
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,551
Damn, what the hell
happened to you, man?

415
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,517
I haven't been myself lately.

416
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,241
Look, no worries.

417
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:12,034
I just need them free whale
edits on the desk by 5:00.

418
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:13,551
You pull that off for me?

419
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:19,620
What?

420
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:20,655
Free what?

421
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,413
The book, man.

422
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,310
The one we've been
working on for six months?

423
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:31,275
Oh, that's the
book I'm editing now.

424
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:36,517
You kid, man.

425
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:37,586
You crazy, Tom.

426
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:43,000
I had a rough time, man.

427
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,172
Yeah, I can see.

428
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,793
Damn, you smell like
a frat house, brother.

429
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:51,275
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

430
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:55,320
Well, man, I've
been letting a lot

431
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:58,172
of this weird behavior slide
'cause you do good work.

432
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:01,689
I do?

433
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:03,620
I do.
Yeah.

434
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,586
I mean when you show up.

435
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,655
Look, man, pull
yourself together

436
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,758
for appearances, all right?

437
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:16,448
I will, I will, I am.

438
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,689
Look, man, we all
have our issues.

439
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:29,689
Appearances, all right?

440
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:36,586
Appearances, Tom.
Appearances.

441
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:49,344
And Molly's so pretty
with her freckles today.

442
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:54,482
Oh, and we had toast with jam
and we played hide and seek.

443
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:03,482
Heat.

444
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,655
Y'all real?

445
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:06,103
Can you feel it?

446
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:08,103
Can you feel the heat?

447
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,000
How was court?

448
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,896
It was fine.

449
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,137
It was fine.

450
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:19,585
What are you doing?

451
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:23,137
Dr. Faust contacted Thomas.

452
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,965
The fuck?

453
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,724
She did?

454
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:26,862
That's what he said.

455
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:29,310
We did serve her that order?

456
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:31,862
Well, yeah, I mean,
which means it's not right,

457
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:33,103
but it's not illegal.

458
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,206
- Weird.
- Yeah, it is weird.

459
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,688
Yes, but not illegal?

460
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:42,516
Yeah, why was all this stuff

461
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:45,172
in Thomas's office
upstairs in the attic?

462
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,137
This is strange.

463
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,172
I don't know.

464
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,896
You think that he was working
on this before the fires?

465
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,310
Apparently so.

466
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,448
What are you thinking?

467
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,137
I don't know yet.

468
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,965
Julie, Julie Newl?

469
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,896
- Yes.
- Someone will

470
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,172
be with you shortly.
Thank you.

471
00:35:51,965 --> 00:35:54,689
- Good luck, Tekiah.
- Thank you.

472
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,310
Oh, don't worry.

473
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,103
I'm not your
competition or anything.

474
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:10,482
I'm not here for anything.

475
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,000
Oh, that's such a relief.

476
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:17,034
Tell me about it.

477
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:19,413
I'm in no shape
for an interview.

478
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:52,172
Sorry, I had to wait long
enough so they wouldn't think

479
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:56,103
we were together.
Okay, thanks.

480
00:36:56,137 --> 00:36:57,448
What can I get you?

481
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,310
Oh, I'll have
a coffee, please.

482
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,068
Sir?

483
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:05,103
What she said, coffee.

484
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:09,206
All right, then.

485
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,172
So, how you doing?

486
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,034
You look really, really great.

487
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:25,448
I mean, your kid looks
great, but you...

488
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:29,034
- Thanks, he's my world.
- Yeah, wow.

489
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,482
I've been drinking
mostly, a lot.

490
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:39,586
Pretty much all the time.

491
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:45,310
Tom, you're
not homeless, are you?

492
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:50,517
I honestly, I mean,
I really don't know.

493
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:51,551
I haven't checked.

494
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:54,206
I had a small little
campfire in my bathroom

495
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:56,000
a couple nights ago, but...

496
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:00,068
Oh my God, Tom.

497
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:02,034
It's okay, it was okay.

498
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,965
Who was she?

499
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
She was, she was...

500
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:13,586
She was everything I imagined.

501
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,793
Like she was the one, if you
believe in that sort of thing.

502
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:22,344
She was so funny.

503
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:27,137
We even talked about
having kids and...

504
00:38:28,241 --> 00:38:32,241
Wow, I am such a
lunatic, you know that?

505
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,034
Why is that?

506
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:39,275
It's, we couldn't, we
couldn't even have kids.

507
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:44,344
I mean, that's a
long story, whatever.

508
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:46,896
Can I ask you a question?

509
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:48,379
Of course you can.

510
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay, if you could choose
between being truly happy

511
00:38:58,482 --> 00:39:02,931
and being aware, what
would you choose?

512
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,000
What do you mean, Tom?

513
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:06,275
What do you mean being aware?

514
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,310
Okay, like what if you could,

515
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,000
what if you could trick yourself

516
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:17,103
into believing something like...

517
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:23,172
Never mind, this is
a stupid question.

518
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:24,586
Never mind.
No, no.

519
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,724
- How you been?
- No, it's not stupid.

520
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:31,689
Ask me.
Yeah.

521
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:35,172
Well, all right.

522
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,620
What if you could
be truly happy,

523
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:42,517
but in order to do so
you would have to live

524
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:47,068
in some sort of dream
reality la-la land?

525
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,793
This is so silly.

526
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:52,068
It's not silly.

527
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,182
I would choose to be aware.

528
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:56,896
You'd rather be
miserable in reality

529
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,620
for the rest of your life

530
00:39:58,655 --> 00:40:00,758
rather than being
happy in la-la land?

531
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,379
I'm a mom now.

532
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:04,827
I have Carter.

533
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,275
I have to be conscious.

534
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,103
I can't live in a dream land.

535
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:12,413
Besides, reality is
what you make it.

536
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:14,413
You don't have to be miserable.

537
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:20,172
Right, I mean, I
guess that makes sense.

538
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:24,379
You're talking about
the drinking, right?

539
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:30,172
Sure, the drinking, yeah.

540
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:32,310
You know they have
programs for that?

541
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:37,000
Tom, I know you don't want
to hear this and it's hard,

542
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,620
but you can't drink this away.

543
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,931
Sooner or later, you're
going to have to deal with it

544
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:45,965
and you're not going to
be miserable forever.

545
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,310
Trust me, I promise.

546
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:55,482
What happened
between us, Tekiah?

547
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:59,482
Time, life, you know.

548
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:03,655
No, what happened between us?

549
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:07,344
You, me, why didn't we work?

550
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:10,758
And I honestly can't
remember why we broke up.

551
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:14,068
I don't know.

552
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:20,172
There you go, sir.

553
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:21,793
Can I get you anything else?

554
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:25,758
Sir?

555
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,862
Listen, Why don't
we get out of here?

556
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:36,344
We'll go to the park and then
you can come by the house

557
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:38,586
and wait with me for Carter.

558
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:44,689
I don't, Tekiah, it's...

559
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:49,034
It's a bit too soon for me.

560
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:51,310
Boy, stop, all I
was talking about

561
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:53,241
was getting some warm
food in your belly.

562
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:56,379
Oh, right, right, right.

563
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,172
I'm so sorry.

564
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:59,586
That sounds great, I'm sorry.

565
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:03,172
Okay, let's not make
this any more awkward

566
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,344
than it already is.

567
00:42:22,344 --> 00:42:23,241
You got your PJs on, babe?

568
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,206
Yes, Mommy.

569
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:27,275
All right.

570
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,137
Bedtime in 10 minutes.
Yes, Mommy.

571
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:46,241
You can't drink in here
around my kid, Tom.

572
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:00,137
This is what I came here for.

573
00:43:01,137 --> 00:43:04,206
I'm a mess, but
I'm not a scumbag.

574
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:07,344
I'm sorry, it's just
that promised after Tyler,

575
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:11,275
that I would never have a drunk
in here around Carter again.

576
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,586
Look, listen, I don't
have to stay here.

577
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,827
I can go home.

578
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,724
No, no, you need
a friend right now.

579
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,275
And I want Carter to
meet my old friend, Tom,

580
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,448
after I clean you up a bit.

581
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:25,310
What?

582
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:27,482
You don't like the beard?
No.

583
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:30,931
Gee, I was going
for the war gate look.

584
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:32,586
It's not working.

585
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,310
Nah, nah, but look,
all jokes aside.

586
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:39,206
Are you comfortable
with me staying here?

587
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,413
It's kind of random.

588
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:43,620
Random is what we do.

589
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:49,068
If it's not broke,
don't try to fix it.

590
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,758
Thanks, you are a dear friend.

591
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:04,689
Goodnight, Mister.

592
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:15,758
What we watching, big guy?

593
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:17,655
"Tom and Jerry."

594
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,413
Oh, those guys
are my favorite.

595
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:21,413
Really?

596
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:27,241
- Yeah.
- Mine, too.

597
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:49,551
- Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

598
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,586
"Tom and Jerry" is on.

599
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:56,379
I put some shaving cream
in the bathroom for you

600
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:58,931
and there's a bag of
clothes by the closet.

601
00:44:58,965 --> 00:45:00,482
Stuff I've been
meaning to get rid of,

602
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,689
but help yourself to
whatever you like.

603
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:05,586
Yeah, okay, appreciate it.

604
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:08,172
Wait a minute.

605
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,448
Both of us just come
out of heavy situations

606
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:13,896
and I don't want either of
us to get the wrong idea.

607
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:15,482
You know what I mean?

608
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:18,620
- Yeah, thanks for...
- You can't live here.

609
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:20,310
I'm sorry, it came out harsh.

610
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:21,586
I didn't mean it like that.

611
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,689
No, it's okay.

612
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:25,689
I was planning on going
home today anyway.

613
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,137
I feel like such an idiot.

614
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:28,251
Nah, you're not an idiot.

615
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:29,724
You're just a good mother.

616
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,275
You don't have to leave today.

617
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,482
You could...
Nah, I gotta go back home

618
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,551
and check on some
of these damages.

619
00:45:39,586 --> 00:45:42,103
Besides I was thinking
about what you said earlier

620
00:45:42,137 --> 00:45:44,758
and I think you're right.

621
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:45,793
About what?

622
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:48,586
I want to try being
aware for a while.

623
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,344
What's this?

624
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,655
Just feels good to be
right about something.

625
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:04,620
It's amazing, we have
so many little people

626
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:07,344
crammed into this tiny,
little spot on the planet,

627
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:10,413
trying to connect with
everything except each other.

628
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:13,413
What's wrong with us, Doc?

629
00:46:14,827 --> 00:46:16,137
People are scared.

630
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:17,620
Scared of what?

631
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:18,758
We're all just people.

632
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:21,758
Scared of not getting
what they desire,

633
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:23,724
what they desperately seek.

634
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:26,586
Love, self-fulfillment, meaning.

635
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,448
And what's this?

636
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:32,689
This is somehow supposed
to fix everyone's problems?

637
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,620
No, it's not for everyone,

638
00:46:34,655 --> 00:46:36,793
but I simply wanted
to provide an option

639
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,172
when there wasn't one.

640
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:42,000
An alternative to a life of
grief or despair, sadness.

641
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,413
I mean, I have been
having a rough time.

642
00:46:51,068 --> 00:46:53,620
So we're going to
extend your contract.

643
00:46:53,655 --> 00:46:59,034
No, I'm done and I'm
done drinking, too.

644
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:07,620
Now I see why you've
been having a rough time.

645
00:47:07,655 --> 00:47:08,655
Huh?

646
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:10,206
Drinking is one thing.

647
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,344
The dextromethorphan that's...

648
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:13,689
Dextro what?

649
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:16,482
DXM, it's a hallucinogenic.

650
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:19,793
It makes the Envision process
vivid and unpredictable.

651
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,724
I think you should
take a few days and...

652
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,000
- Nah.
- Yup, yeah.

653
00:47:25,034 --> 00:47:28,862
Just take a few days without
the drinking and the DXM

654
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,758
and let me know
what you think then.

655
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:36,103
- You are the Doc.
- Absolutely.

656
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:41,000
Take these and it will
subdue the effects

657
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:43,344
and give you a glimpse
into the real world.

658
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,941
I just want you to
make the right decision

659
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:47,517
in the right frame of mind.

660
00:47:54,068 --> 00:47:56,137
I'll see you in a
couple of days, Doc.

661
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,724
Hey Jack, check this
out, listen, listen.

662
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:06,620
Can you please put
some clothes on, please?

663
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,482
My brother is going
to be here any minute.

664
00:48:08,517 --> 00:48:09,655
It's your brother.

665
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:10,689
It's not the Dalai Lama.

666
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:11,896
Just listen.
Come on, Larry.

667
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:15,000
Larry, I can smell your
sour ass from over here.

668
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:16,665
Like that's nasty.
I took a shower last night

669
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,586
and you best just listen.
It's a new day.

670
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,758
What up, what
up, what up, y'all?

671
00:48:21,827 --> 00:48:23,758
- Hey.
- She's late for a nice game?

672
00:48:23,793 --> 00:48:25,000
You smell sour ass?

673
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:27,379
- No.
- Shit.

674
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:29,137
Really, Larry?

675
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,241
Really, really?

676
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,482
Look, this pregnancy done

677
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:34,103
gave your sister
a bloodhound nose.

678
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:36,310
- Yup, I can smell...
- Can you smell the future?

679
00:48:36,344 --> 00:48:38,172
Yup, and it smells
like sour ass.

680
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,034
You're right, yup, sure can.

681
00:48:40,068 --> 00:48:41,862
Anyway, how's work going?

682
00:48:41,896 --> 00:48:43,827
Work is horrible.

683
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:45,724
I have a really horrible job.

684
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:46,758
Horrible?

685
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,862
I thought you loved your job.

686
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,206
So did I, but I don't.

687
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:54,034
I'm actually looking
for something new today.

688
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:58,034
Okay, but just know that
we still need to have a talk.

689
00:48:58,793 --> 00:49:02,275
Sure, but what about though?

690
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,448
We need to wait, legal stuff.

691
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:08,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
is this serious?

692
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:09,758
What legal stuff?

693
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:11,620
Well, sorta, yeah.

694
00:49:11,655 --> 00:49:14,137
Like we just need to sort
out a couple of things

695
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:16,793
and then we go from there.

696
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:21,586
Just wait a couple
of days, all right?

697
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,827
So Tom, check this out.

698
00:49:26,862 --> 00:49:28,482
You appreciate this.

699
00:49:28,517 --> 00:49:30,206
So you know how
they got, nowadays,

700
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:31,424
they got these different things

701
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:32,527
for lonely people to
meet up with each other?

702
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:33,896
They got speed dating.

703
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:36,275
They got online dating.

704
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,793
Real loser stuff, date nights.

705
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:40,172
All that bullshit?

706
00:49:40,206 --> 00:49:43,000
Larry, you're starting
to worry me, man.

707
00:49:43,034 --> 00:49:45,000
Like this is the second
time you said we needed

708
00:49:45,034 --> 00:49:46,862
to talk about what's
really going on,

709
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:48,793
but you're not really
saying nothing.

710
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:50,241
So what's this about?

711
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:51,482
This about the arrest?

712
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,620
The doctor?

713
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:53,793
It's not about the arrest.

714
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,172
I, well, we will talk.

715
00:49:57,862 --> 00:49:58,862
Just trust me.

716
00:49:58,896 --> 00:49:59,793
Just trust me, Tom.

717
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:00,872
Give me a little bit more time.

718
00:50:00,896 --> 00:50:02,103
You know me a lot of years,

719
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:05,103
so you know I got
you, all right?

720
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,793
So Tom, check this out.

721
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:11,000
Listen to this.

722
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:12,872
"Living in the city
breathes the people that are

723
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:14,862
"in dire need of
human connection.

724
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:17,724
"For all those souls who yearn

725
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:20,068
"for a little human interaction,
we have the solution."

726
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,068
All right, what I'm
about to say next

727
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,620
is probably ridiculous.

728
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:29,344
Most ridiculous thing you
ever heard, all right?

729
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:31,586
This new thing is called...

730
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,620
Y'all ready?

731
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:35,000
It's called cuddle parties.

732
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,413
What the hell
is a cuddle party?

733
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:38,068
A cuddle party.

734
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:39,586
What is that?

735
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,758
Well, apparently is a
party where you cuddle.

736
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:42,827
They cuddle at the party.

737
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:45,482
You made it up.
I kid you not.

738
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:46,517
Check it out.

739
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,413
- Whatever, Larry.
- Cuddle party shit.

740
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:56,103
What'd I tell you?

741
00:50:59,034 --> 00:51:00,206
See the thing.

742
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:18,896
I want everyone here to know

743
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:23,000
that this is a very
safe environment, okay?

744
00:51:24,103 --> 00:51:29,103
Everyone here is here for
the same basic reasons,

745
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:34,344
so we need to feel like
we can trust each other

746
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:37,068
before we start our journey.

747
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:40,793
That's why you guys are
going to hold hands.

748
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,827
Now some ground rules.

749
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:51,000
This is not about sex people,

750
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:54,517
so no touching each
other's delicates please.

751
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:00,724
Accidents are accidents
and that's fine,

752
00:52:00,758 --> 00:52:06,103
but let's just be respectful
so we can all share

753
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:09,275
in a powerful experience.

754
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:16,586
Now, let's start by stating
some personal boundaries.

755
00:52:18,103 --> 00:52:21,034
I just don't want
any dry humping, okay?

756
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:24,137
I just don't want a massage
from someone's crotch.

757
00:52:24,172 --> 00:52:26,068
Okay, I think that falls

758
00:52:26,103 --> 00:52:29,655
under the "no sexual
behavior" category.

759
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:34,103
Okay, but last week
this really lonely guy

760
00:52:34,137 --> 00:52:38,000
was dry humping me and it made
me a little uncomfortable.

761
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:41,103
Okay, I understand
that, thank you.

762
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:43,034
And don't rub my ass

763
00:52:43,068 --> 00:52:45,517
for more than five
seconds at a time.

764
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:46,689
I don't like that either.

765
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:49,310
Okay then, anyone else?

766
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:09,172
What, what are you
doing back there?

767
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:14,103
- Massaging you.
- What?

768
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:16,517
It feels like I'm
being examined.

769
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:18,862
Thomas, why don't you
try to put more emotions

770
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:19,862
in your fingertips?

771
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,551
Let's truly connect here.

772
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:25,310
Let the love pour from you

773
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:29,379
until we're just laying in
a big pool of love together.

774
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:31,689
Yeah, yeah, that sounds nice.

775
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:38,413
I'll try.

776
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,172
Yeah, that's it.

777
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:52,172
What, wait, why'd you stop?

778
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:57,689
I'm sorry, this
is too weird for me.

779
00:54:00,896 --> 00:54:02,241
I can't, I can't do this.

780
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:05,172
Thomas, don't you want to
truly connect with someone?

781
00:54:05,206 --> 00:54:07,241
Don't you want to be loved?

782
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:09,724
Yeah, we can love you.

783
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:13,241
We can all love you together.

784
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:17,034
Oh, no, no, no,
ma'am, no, no, no, no.

785
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:18,724
Not like this.

786
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:20,620
This, this isn't real.

787
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:24,517
This, this, I can't, I can't.

788
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:27,182
You're just a bunch of
waitresses smiling at me

789
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:28,655
while you take my order.

790
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:10,034
Sir, can I help you?

791
00:55:11,034 --> 00:55:13,620
I was here to
see some friends.

792
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:15,103
This is not a safe place.

793
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:17,137
You should move along.

794
00:55:17,172 --> 00:55:21,206
Okay, what's going on?

795
00:55:21,241 --> 00:55:23,344
A fire in the scene, come on.

796
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,586
Was anyone hurt?

797
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,241
A woman and her child died.

798
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:30,379
Oh my God.

799
00:55:33,482 --> 00:55:37,068
Sir, sir, it was a
couple of years ago.

800
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:38,793
- I was just here.
- Relax.

801
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:46,137
I hate this neighborhood.

802
00:55:57,965 --> 00:55:59,172
Sir, are you okay?

803
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:05,620
This is it.

804
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:10,310
I'm so sorry, Tom.

805
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:13,068
We never thought you
would do this to yourself.

806
00:56:13,758 --> 00:56:16,310
Just relax and rest.

807
00:56:17,448 --> 00:56:20,655
I promise we won't let this
happen again, I promise.

808
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,379
You can't help her, Thomas.

809
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:37,586
This is the past.

810
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,344
You can't help him, either.

811
00:56:41,275 --> 00:56:43,206
What's done is done.

812
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,862
Hey sweetie, how was your day?

813
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:50,137
Great, I finished.

814
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,275
That's great.

815
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,620
This could be my big break.

816
00:56:53,655 --> 00:56:57,034
That's the
Envision company story, right?

817
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:58,517
Yes, yes, and
you won't believe

818
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:01,793
what this company was doing
to get the FDA to sign off.

819
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,517
Did you think of a title?

820
00:57:05,206 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, I think I'm going
to go with "Imprisoned."

821
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:10,172
What?

822
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:12,448
I thought it was funny.

823
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:17,310
Are you getting sick?

824
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:19,551
Just a little cold,
baby, that's all.

825
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:21,241
You need
to take some medicine.

826
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:24,206
There's some cough syrup
in the cabinet, all right?

827
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:26,206
And I'm going to
go check on Carter

828
00:57:26,241 --> 00:57:28,206
and then we'll celebrate.

829
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:29,137
Cool, cool, cool.

830
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:30,758
Where those fancy glasses?

831
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:46,000
Sir, is there
anyone else in here?

832
00:57:51,896 --> 00:57:57,068
Make it stoop.

833
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:03,620
Sir, sir, is
there anyone else in here?

834
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:07,586
Make it stop.

835
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,034
Sir, is there
anyone else in here?

836
00:58:18,241 --> 00:58:20,620
Let's get you out of here.

837
00:58:31,103 --> 00:58:34,517
Tom, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

838
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,137
Doctor, thank you so much
for taking care of him.

839
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:41,931
It's my pleasure,
Mrs. Sullivan.

840
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:43,068
No, you were right.

841
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,034
We should have trusted you.

842
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:45,206
I'm so sorry.

843
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:47,689
You did what you
thought was best,

844
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,551
so no apology needed, seriously.

845
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:52,655
He's waking up.

846
00:58:56,862 --> 00:58:59,586
- You.
- No, Tom, Tom, relax.

847
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,551
She's trying to help.

848
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:01,482
She's trying to help.

849
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:04,206
- It's okay.
- No, no, I remember, no.

850
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,551
Tom, she's trying to help.

851
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:10,689
No, no, no, I remember.

852
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,586
Time to take your crazy pills.

853
00:59:16,517 --> 00:59:21,344
- Funny, Iris.
- Fine, more for me.

854
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:24,689
- We get out today.
- Can't wait.

855
00:59:26,034 --> 00:59:30,517
How's the head?
Focused.

856
00:59:36,413 --> 00:59:38,620
So Doc, how's our guy doing?

857
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:42,379
Thomas seems to be coping
and as far as Dr. Faust goes,

858
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:45,517
she no longer has
direct contact with him.

859
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:46,551
What happened?

860
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:49,931
Thomas has strong negative
feelings towards the doctor

861
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,724
and he blames her
for his situation.

862
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,413
There were a few incidents,

863
00:59:53,448 --> 00:59:54,068
but he's calm now.

864
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:55,275
He's talking to Iris,

865
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,413
His dead girlfriend?

866
00:59:57,448 --> 00:59:58,137
She is not dead.

867
00:59:58,172 --> 00:59:59,103
She was never alive.

868
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,137
She was an illusion.

869
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:04,034
Well, are you sure that
Thomas is going to be all right

870
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,206
when he leaves?

871
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:08,241
The delusions manifest
themselves physically,

872
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,448
a result of the implant,

873
01:00:09,482 --> 01:00:12,034
but psychologically he
is in perfect health,

874
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:14,793
except for an unknown
amount of memory loss.

875
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:16,517
He has an imaginary friend?

876
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:18,389
He's not on any medication.

877
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,379
He is not diagnosed
with a disorder.

878
01:00:20,413 --> 01:00:22,724
We couldn't keep him here
even if we wanted to.

879
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:28,068
Okay, so will he hurt
himself again or anyone else?

880
01:00:29,344 --> 01:00:31,896
Mrs. Sullivan, he is perfectly
safe to himself and others.

881
01:00:31,931 --> 01:00:33,137
His attempt to hurt himself

882
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:35,931
was just him processing
this new reality.

883
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,448
Now that he's come to
terms with it, he's fine.

884
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:39,482
Even Dr. Faust?

885
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:44,482
Just keep that bitch away
from my brother, Dr. Keller.

886
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:46,493
That's something
we're going to have

887
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,965
to manage together,
Mrs. Sullivan.

888
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,275
All right, Doc.

889
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,551
We'll be by to pick him
up tomorrow afternoon.

890
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:01,206
Released already?

891
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,551
We don't even know
what he remembers.

892
01:01:06,275 --> 01:01:11,448
No, I'll handle it, no police.

893
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,517
Hey, Larry, man, he
looks just like you.

894
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:23,896
Yeah, I was kind of
hoping he would get my brains

895
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,413
and Jackie's looks, but...

896
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,275
- Larry.
- Driving here.

897
01:01:28,896 --> 01:01:31,793
Tom, are you all
right, like really?

898
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,172
I'm fine, I have some time
to think about some things

899
01:01:37,206 --> 01:01:38,758
and sort 'em out.

900
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:41,827
And?

901
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:43,655
I'll be fine, Jackie.

902
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:46,872
You're gonna have
to stay with us for a while.

903
01:01:46,896 --> 01:01:48,137
Why?

904
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:49,492
Because I can take
care of myself.

905
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:51,344
We know you can, but you need

906
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:54,517
to be someplace
that's really safe.

907
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,551
I mean, we got plenty of room.

908
01:01:57,586 --> 01:02:00,034
Well, I don't want to be a
burden on you two or anything.

909
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:02,034
Nah, we got
plenty of room, Tom.

910
01:02:04,034 --> 01:02:06,310
You got evicted while
you were in there.

911
01:02:06,344 --> 01:02:09,724
Yeah, all your things are
at, we have all your stuff.

912
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:12,965
All right, well, thanks, guys.

913
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,517
Oh, your friend can come to.

914
01:02:14,551 --> 01:02:15,517
- Larry.
- What?

915
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,310
Is she back there?

916
01:02:17,344 --> 01:02:20,241
How about you keep your
eyes on the road, Dad.

917
01:02:20,275 --> 01:02:23,034
- Got you, got you.
- I'm sorry, Tom, I'm sorry.

918
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:24,586
It's cool, it's cool.

919
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:28,275
I'm meeting up with her later.

920
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:32,724
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

921
01:02:56,379 --> 01:02:59,275
Maybe we should bring
back a rose for old Agnes.

922
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,689
It's like her life didn't
mean anything to me.

923
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:06,517
Well, not entirely
meaningless.

924
01:03:06,551 --> 01:03:07,655
What do you mean?

925
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,172
You really are crazy,

926
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:12,103
aren't you?
Certifiable.

927
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:15,517
Don't you remember?

928
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:20,551
You've seen Agnes before.

929
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:24,103
What do you mean?

930
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,137
You really are crazy,

931
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:27,517
aren't you?
Certifiable.

932
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:30,310
Don't you remember?

933
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:32,586
You've seen Agnes before.

934
01:03:37,586 --> 01:03:38,827
I can't remember her.

935
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:41,793
It's like a blank space.

936
01:03:43,241 --> 01:03:45,793
And you're not making
this no easier.

937
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:51,000
Thomas, I can only show
you what you want to see.

938
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:32,103
Thomas, what are
you doing here?

939
01:04:33,344 --> 01:04:36,827
Honestly, Doc, I came here
to break in your office,

940
01:04:36,862 --> 01:04:38,689
but I'm glad you're here.

941
01:04:39,896 --> 01:04:42,793
And I see you've done
most of my work for me.

942
01:04:42,827 --> 01:04:45,793
Thomas, leave it alone.

943
01:04:45,827 --> 01:04:47,137
Tell me about Agnes.

944
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,862
It was the implant.

945
01:04:52,896 --> 01:04:54,034
What?

946
01:04:54,068 --> 01:04:55,241
No, you have no idea

947
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:57,103
who you're getting
involved with, Thomas.

948
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,172
Okay, Dr. Keller,
Brenda, I need your help.

949
01:05:05,655 --> 01:05:09,379
Do you have any idea of
what it's like to not know

950
01:05:09,413 --> 01:05:13,241
if your life is real or
some imaginary world made up

951
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:14,620
by your subconscious?

952
01:05:15,655 --> 01:05:19,103
To love someone with
every fiber of your being,

953
01:05:19,137 --> 01:05:21,620
only to find out they
don't even exist?

954
01:05:27,448 --> 01:05:31,137
Everything I believed
in, everything I loved,

955
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:34,413
everything that makes
me who I am is gone

956
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:35,655
or never existed.

957
01:05:38,896 --> 01:05:41,068
Do you even care how
that makes me feel?

958
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,413
How many lives have been ruined?

959
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:46,827
How many people have
you and Faust killed?

960
01:05:46,862 --> 01:05:48,182
Do you think I
wanted this to happen?

961
01:05:48,206 --> 01:05:49,862
Do you think I meant
for Agnes to die?

962
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:51,482
She was my sister.

963
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:54,103
What?

964
01:05:54,137 --> 01:05:55,724
She was my sister.

965
01:05:56,655 --> 01:05:58,000
I only wanted to help her.

966
01:06:00,448 --> 01:06:03,275
Agnes was the only
survivor of a car accident

967
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,586
with her husband and her child.

968
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,068
I just wanted to create
a better life for her.

969
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:14,137
If it were the implant
that killed her, Doctor,

970
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:15,379
why am I still alive?

971
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:17,551
You're supposed to be dead.

972
01:06:17,586 --> 01:06:19,068
You should be dead.

973
01:06:21,793 --> 01:06:23,275
I want to die.

974
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,068
I want the pain to go away.

975
01:06:26,068 --> 01:06:29,103
You took everything away
from me, even peace.

976
01:06:29,137 --> 01:06:30,551
I tried to get her to stop.

977
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,620
I was too afraid
to go to the police

978
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,931
and she wanted me to keep silent

979
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:36,517
and she used it against me.

980
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,448
How much longer do I
have to live, Doctor?

981
01:06:40,482 --> 01:06:42,793
We don't even know
why you're still here.

982
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:46,896
Nothing has changed
since Agnes's death.

983
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:49,551
You could expire at any time.

984
01:06:49,586 --> 01:06:52,068
There were no warning
signs with my sister.

985
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,724
All right, okay, Dr. Keller.

986
01:06:57,034 --> 01:07:01,517
Well, before I expire,
understand one thing.

987
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:06,448
You and Faust will pay
for what you've done.

988
01:07:20,896 --> 01:07:22,827
Iris, what are you doing here?

989
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:24,517
I came to help, Tom.

990
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:26,172
There's no use, Iris.

991
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:28,655
I don't have much time left.

992
01:07:28,689 --> 01:07:30,689
I know, it's the implant.

993
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:34,344
You knew this whole
time and didn't tell me?

994
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:40,724
I'm so sorry, Tom.

995
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:44,172
Remember, I can only show
you what you want to see.

996
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,827
Well, Faust is going to pay.

997
01:07:48,862 --> 01:07:50,000
There are other crimes

998
01:07:50,034 --> 01:07:52,724
and we'll see it wait to
the local new station.

999
01:07:52,758 --> 01:07:54,137
I got to find that envelope.

1000
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,907
What do you remember
about the last time

1001
01:07:56,931 --> 01:07:58,655
you had it?
Practically nothing.

1002
01:08:15,827 --> 01:08:17,206
Hey, that's too much.

1003
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:19,344
You can't take that much.

1004
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:22,620
Relax, baby, it's just
a little cough syrup.

1005
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,448
It's not gonna kill me.

1006
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:25,724
Look, check this
out, look, look.

1007
01:08:25,758 --> 01:08:29,068
Daytime, non-drowsy, I'm okay.

1008
01:08:29,103 --> 01:08:32,344
Right, did you
find the glasses?

1009
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:36,241
Yeah, yeah, I did
find the glasses.

1010
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:42,000
Oh, so you moved them?
Just pour.

1011
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,792
We were drinking and I...

1012
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:42,448
The cough syrup.

1013
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:47,172
I didn't wake up.

1014
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,482
They died because of me.

1015
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:56,172
Hey, you didn't do this, okay?

1016
01:09:57,206 --> 01:10:01,482
Come on.

1017
01:10:03,344 --> 01:10:05,034
Iris, I'm dying.

1018
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:08,034
But you're not,
so stop acting like it.

1019
01:10:16,103 --> 01:10:19,206
Iris, hurry up,
wake up, wake up.

1020
01:10:21,862 --> 01:10:23,379
Could you get off me, please?

1021
01:10:24,896 --> 01:10:26,034
You okay?

1022
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:27,758
Pull yourself together, Tom.

1023
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:30,585
Imaginary, ring a bell?

1024
01:10:33,206 --> 01:10:35,724
Come on, let's go
find that envelope.

1025
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:52,309
I'm so sorry, Thomas.

1026
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:54,689
The good Dr. Keller
managed to come to grips

1027
01:10:54,724 --> 01:10:56,241
with her own kill.

1028
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:58,137
It was gonna go to mid-40s.

1029
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:02,344
It was quite the breakthrough.

1030
01:11:09,206 --> 01:11:12,068
- You're late.
- I can't believe

1031
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:14,482
you let this chick
get the jump on you.

1032
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:15,965
A little help, please?

1033
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,068
She's a little old
woman, that's embarrassing.

1034
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:25,655
I see the implant
is still working.

1035
01:11:26,896 --> 01:11:28,793
I thought things could work out.

1036
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:32,309
Not good, Tom.

1037
01:11:35,827 --> 01:11:37,206
You killed her?

1038
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:43,309
Oh, did our dear doctor
tell you about your wife, too?

1039
01:11:44,103 --> 01:11:45,413
My wife?

1040
01:11:46,793 --> 01:11:50,034
Yeah, she was actually an
unfortunate, unnecessary,

1041
01:11:50,068 --> 01:11:52,724
unintended, I mean, like
unintended, seriously,

1042
01:11:52,758 --> 01:11:56,689
ended up a casualty of war.

1043
01:11:56,724 --> 01:11:59,068
Casualty of war, I suppose.

1044
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:03,241
Oh, did you mean someone else?

1045
01:12:04,206 --> 01:12:05,413
Agnes Blythe?

1046
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:08,965
Oh, on the contrary.

1047
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,344
Mrs. Blythe was a child
in psychiatric medicine,

1048
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:16,103
a product of
scientific development.

1049
01:12:16,137 --> 01:12:20,309
And you, sir, are the
evolution of that science.

1050
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:25,344
Don't move.

1051
01:12:27,103 --> 01:12:30,137
It's because of you
that we were able

1052
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:32,172
to move forward with Envision.

1053
01:12:32,206 --> 01:12:35,172
It is because of you that
I figured out the cause

1054
01:12:35,206 --> 01:12:40,172
for Mrs. Blythe's untimely death
and it also because of you.

1055
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:42,172
You get the credit.

1056
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:47,309
That she's kind of like a
modern day scientific hero.

1057
01:12:51,655 --> 01:12:54,550
The human trials you
were so bent on stopping

1058
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:56,965
through your little
research articles

1059
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,448
were made possible
because of you.

1060
01:13:00,655 --> 01:13:05,758
And that cough syrup you
unwittingly started drinking...

1061
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:09,412
You see, it contained a missing
chemical to our equation.

1062
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:13,965
You see, dextromethorphan,

1063
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,309
that's contained
in the cough syrup.

1064
01:13:16,344 --> 01:13:20,137
You see, it stopped
the Envision implant

1065
01:13:20,172 --> 01:13:23,137
from overloading your synapses.

1066
01:13:23,172 --> 01:13:26,758
The overload of synapses is
what caused Mrs. Blythe's death.

1067
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,241
Her neurotransmitters
stopped functioning

1068
01:13:34,379 --> 01:13:39,103
and all of her natural
functions ceased to a bullet.

1069
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:44,137
You surviving the first fire
was a convenient mistake.

1070
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,793
That won't happen again.

1071
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:53,931
I said get out.

1072
01:13:53,965 --> 01:13:55,965
Okay, okay, breathe, breathe.

1073
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,965
You trying to burn
down the house, ma'am?

1074
01:13:58,827 --> 01:13:59,758
I'll show you a fire.

1075
01:13:59,793 --> 01:14:00,689
That's really not necessary.

1076
01:14:00,724 --> 01:14:02,241
That's really not necessary.

1077
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:05,896
- Not exactly.
- Get out.

1078
01:14:05,931 --> 01:14:08,344
Thomas, don't leave
me, don't leave me.

1079
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,517
- I got a article to rewrite.
- No, no.

1080
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,550
It's okay, it's okay.

1081
01:14:17,344 --> 01:14:18,517
I won't play with fire.

1082
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,413
So Larry, y'all gonna
give the little guy name

1083
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:30,724
or what's up?

1084
01:14:31,793 --> 01:14:34,655
- Well...
- I was thinking

1085
01:14:34,689 --> 01:14:35,872
about naming him Little Larry.

1086
01:14:35,896 --> 01:14:39,309
Oh, hell no, nope, nope.

1087
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:42,689
We gonna name him after
someone who's really special.

1088
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:45,241
- Hey.
- Nope, I mean,

1089
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:46,413
we were really thinking

1090
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,482
about naming him
after someone special.

1091
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:50,827
Who?

1092
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:51,862
No, no, no, not me.

1093
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:56,413
No, no, no, but we were
thinking of naming him Carter.

1094
01:14:59,137 --> 01:15:00,517
- Carter?
- Yeah.

1095
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:03,413
Only if you cool
with it, though.

1096
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:13,034
What you think, big guy?

1097
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:16,172
Looks like a Carter to me.

1098
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:20,724
I say we let her win, Carter.

1099
01:15:23,655 --> 01:15:25,620
Wait a minute, wait,
wait, wait, you're leaving?

1100
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:27,309
Yeah, I've
got some work to do.

1101
01:15:27,344 --> 01:15:29,413
Wait a minute, you're leaving?

1102
01:15:29,448 --> 01:15:32,517
Yeah, I've got
some work to do.

1103
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:36,000
Yeah, you got fired the
same day you got evicted.

1104
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:38,034
- Larry.
- It's all good.

1105
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,793
Lar, I appreciate
the support and all,

1106
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:42,585
but this research is,

1107
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:49,000
works on me, so perhaps
I'm not unemployed.

1108
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,206
I like to say I'm freelancing.

1109
01:15:54,655 --> 01:15:56,241
All right.
All right.

1110
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:00,448
