1
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,638
You promise to watch the game
and not be bored...

2
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,839
...and I'll go to the opera next week.
I already bought earplugs.

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,709
With your eyesight
I'm surprised you can see the puck.

4
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,678
Yay. All right!

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,911
I can't wait to get into bed.

6
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,396
- There's a Bob Hope movie on television.
- I know.

7
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,758
Do you believe this guy? Killed 12
victims. Dismembered and ate them.

8
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,913
- Really? It's an alternative lifestyle.
- Yeah. I'll say.

9
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,551
- Hold the elevator!
- We're coming.

10
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,678
- Hold the elevator.
- That’s all right.

11
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,871
- I see you at the gym sometimes.
- You do?

12
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,635
- We live down the hall.
- I go whenever I have the discipline.

13
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,997
- It’s important to put that time in.
- I agree.

14
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,435
Exercising changed my life. Just...

15
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,160
I prefer to atrophy.
I don't like exercise.

16
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,959
- We bought a treadmill last week.
- We had one.

17
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,192
We got rid of it because
it was taking up space.

18
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,749
You have to get on it once in a while.

19
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,071
It’s confusing with all those
computerized programs.

20
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,073
- I'm just never going to get that.
- I know.

21
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,390
- Wonderful meeting...
- Well, yeah.

22
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,438
- You never meet your neighbors.
- Isn't it funny?

23
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,079
- Good night.
- Good night.

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,832
Such a lovely couple.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,036
- Oh, say... Hello?
- Yeah?

26
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,909
Why don't you come in and have
a drink? We'd love that.

27
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,833
- That’d be fine.
- She makes great Irish coffee.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,639
- Please.
- There's a movie I want to watch.

29
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,189
- Give me a treadmill lesson.
- About the tread...

30
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,878
Listen, if I can figure it out,
then believe me, anybody can.

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,273
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- It’s easy.

32
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,149
- Let’s look. I'm at level five.
- You're that advanced?

33
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,880
I work out a lot.
Look at these diagrams.

34
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,029
That’s amazing.

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,031
- I can't understand this.
- Let me see.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,509
Yeah, well. See this?

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,717
Now, let me show you
a mint 1933 airmail.

38
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,634
Very rare and very beautiful.
Look at that.

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,190
This is unique because
it has a flaw in the engraving.

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,999
- See if you can see it.
- It’s hard for me.

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,675
- I'll give you a hint. In the corner.
- That tiny thing?

42
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,559
Yeah. That makes it quite valuable.

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,430
I got a commemorative set of issues
that are valuable. Look at the color.

44
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,478
- These are gonna become...
- We're keeping you up.

45
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,676
- No, this is wonderful.
- I should go.

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,798
- What do you do?
- Book publishing. I work at Harper's.

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,949
- Really?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,839
I own an old cinema. Having it redone.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,833
Used to have three.
Business is not what it used to be.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,754
Look at these presidential.
Even the perforations are intact.

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,639
- Where's Carol? I should be going.
- Really?

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,711
- Yeah. I mean...
- Coffee's ready.

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,271
- I forgot coffee.
- We can get back to this later. Come on.

54
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,194
We never had any children
but it’s easy to empathize.

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,432
- What college does your son attend?
- Brown.

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,909
Nice color.

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,994
Paul never attended college.
He's self-made.

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,152
Knowledge is the second most
important thing.

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,472
First is health. Then knowledge.
Then money.

60
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,108
- It’s amazing how time...
- Do you work?

61
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,474
- Do I?
- Yes.

62
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,873
Well, actually I used to work at an ad
agency, but that was many years ago.

63
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,476
But I've been thinking
of starting a restaurant.

64
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,315
- Really?
- But Larry is trying to talk me out of it.

65
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,678
She's a great cook. Her fennel
omelet in hollandaise sauce...

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,953
...will make you snap
into a fetal position and lay in bed.

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,113
He loves to tease me.
Actually, he really loves exotic food.

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,955
My weakness is dessert.
Cream, butter, anything with fat.

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,478
I'll fix a dessert that’ll make your eyes
roll. You'll have to exercise for a month.

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,393
We're going to Le Cirque
for our anniversary.

71
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,471
- 28 years in November.
- Really?

72
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,033
- What do I buy a woman with everything?
- We already have twin cemetery plots.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,033
I always think a Bentley
is in good taste.

74
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,476
On our 20th, I got her
some lovely handkerchiefs.

75
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,677
- They had my initials on them.
- Very high-class.

76
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,400
I didn't even know her size.

77
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,390
Couldn't you keep
the conversation going longer?

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,677
- I was signaling you.
- I was trying to be neighborly.

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,435
Neighborly? If this guy showed me
his stamps one more time...

80
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,672
My favorite thing is to look
at cancelled postage.

81
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,470
Come on. It was sweet. They're
looking forward to their anniversary.

82
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,111
I'm looking forward to that Bob Hope
movie. I don't know why it’s on so late.

83
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,953
- Do you think that will happen to us?
- What?

84
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,194
That we'll become like them. Just another
dull, aging couple with our walks...

85
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,554
We are a dull, aging...

86
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,269
...our TV, our lox and bagels
and our twin cemetery plots?

87
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,399
We should be as lucky.
To be in their shape at their age.

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,472
Did you see the dumbbells
this guy lifts?

89
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,758
If I lifted them I'd get a hernia
the size of the San Andreas Fault.

90
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,358
- How often do you think they make love?
- More than we do, in their shape.

91
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,751
I'm sure as much as once a week.

92
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,480
- Larry?
- God, I'm exhausted. What?

93
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,029
Do you still find me attractive?

94
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,158
What kind of question is that?
Of course I do.

95
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,551
Are we turning into a pair
of comfortable old shoes?

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,110
Never comfortable.
Don't you worry about that.

97
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,434
- How you doing?
- Fine.

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,319
- We're gonna get this one.
- That’s nice.

99
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,869
Are we seeing you
at Elaine's Thursday?

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,554
No. Thursday's our Wagner opera.

101
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,109
- They coming to Elaine's.
- How is Ted?

102
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,910
- I think he's glad he's divorced.
- He's not. Come on.

103
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,516
He's not doing well at all.
He's not used to it.

104
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,591
He looks like he's glad.

105
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,399
- You gonna browse?
- We're going to a movie.

106
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,516
- We're seeing Double Indemnity.
- Come.

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,875
- What do you think?
- It starts in a while.

108
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,713
I'd have the police after her so fast,
it’d make her head spin.

109
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,192
They'd put her through the wringer.
The things they would squeeze out.

110
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,998
They haven't got a thing to go on.

111
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,229
Not too much.

112
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,076
Just 26 years experience and this
hunk of concrete in my stomach.

113
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,718
- That movie was great, wasn't it?
- It’s one of my favorites.

114
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,838
- They were wonderful.
- Who could we fix Ted up with?

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,798
- There must be somebody in your office.
- Ted?

116
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,111
- I thought Ted had a crush on you.
- Me?

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,512
- Why are you so stunned?
- I adore him, but he's like a girlfriend.

118
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,629
- Now he's divorced, you know?
- Do I detect a note of jealousy?

119
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,598
- I had to come and call 911.
- What’s the trouble?

120
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,558
- Is that the EMS?
- What’s going on?

121
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,109
- She had a heart attack.
- Oh, my God.

122
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,589
- She's dead.
- She's dead?

123
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,752
- Dead.
- They're giving Mr. House a sedative.

124
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,911
She was the picture of health.

125
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,232
- I called EMS, but it was too late.
- We just met her last night.

126
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,675
- Awful, just awful.
- What happened?

127
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,718
It was a classic coronary.
She went like that.

128
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,108
- Boy.
- Can we do anything?

129
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,750
You can be good neighbors.
We've calmed him down.

130
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,673
The first time we saw them was
last night. We just met them.

131
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,116
- They invited us in for coffee.
- Such a nice lady.

132
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,269
Sweet person.

133
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,356
- God, okay.
- You look wonderful.

134
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,953
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

135
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,556
- Hi, Mr. House. So sorry.
- Thank you for those flowers.

136
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,153
- It was nice.
- Sure.

137
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,118
- Lf there's anything we can do...
- Anything.

138
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,239
It’s just such a shock.
It was just so sudden.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,756
- She seemed so healthy.
- She had a heart condition.

140
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,036
She did? She never mentioned it.

141
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,272
- Well, she wouldn't have.
- No. Right. Well...

142
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,954
- lf there's anything we can do.
- Anything.

143
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,350
If you're lonely, come by. Whatever.

144
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,593
- You owe me a French dessert.
- I haven't forgotten. Believe me.

145
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,036
- Have a nice time. You're gussied up.
- We're going to the opera.

146
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,474
- Enjoy.
- My favorite.

147
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

148
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,749
Come, we're gonna be late.

149
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,509
The deal was, I sit through the game
and you watch the opera.

150
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,391
I can't listen to that much Wagner.
I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.

151
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,875
I think it’s weird. One night she's
having coffee, and the next she's dead?

152
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,874
I know. And she did not look like
she was ready to go.

153
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,918
Maybe he killed her.
Like he's got a young tootsie.

154
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,559
You gotta see this guy.

155
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,633
This guy gets his jollies from
licking stamps. He's a boring...

156
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,439
I can see that. Depending
on who is on the stamp.

157
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,797
She never mentioned
she had a heart condition.

158
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,349
Well, what is she gonna say?

159
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,397
"Hello, I have a bad heart."

160
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,994
She told me about her hysterectomy.

161
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,199
It’s easier to talk about a
hysterectomy than a heart condition.

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,954
She liked desserts.
Is that what you said?

163
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,712
So she had one too many.

164
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,832
No! She wasn't on a diet.
We discussed diets.

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,675
- She wasn't on a diet.
- This is a great way to kill somebody.

166
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,389
- How?
- You clog their arteries...

167
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,236
...with whipped cream, chocolate mousse,
butter. They go like that.

168
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,709
- That’s great.
- Disgusting, but...

169
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,552
I love it.

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,439
- Wouldn't that be great?
- I'd like to pastry myself to death.

171
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,192
- I'll help you.
- I would.

172
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,352
I'd like another
piece of pie, after this.

173
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,751
Are you gonna start a restaurant?
Are you serious?

174
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,196
- You're a great cook.
- Count me in. I want to be part of it.

175
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,349
- Really.
- Really?

176
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,637
- You should.
- No. I don't know. Are you serious?

177
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,395
- It’d be wonderful.
- What are you encouraging her for?

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,835
- She's a great cook.
- Thanks to you.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,072
It was his idea.
The cooking lessons, I mean.

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,357
A restaurant is serious business
you can't take lightly.

181
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,069
- You can't be cavalier about it.
- I'm not being cavalier.

182
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,118
Do you know how time-consuming it is?

183
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,874
- Wait. Look.
- They steal from you if...

184
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,749
- It’s what I do.
- She'll cook. She's great. She's a pro.

185
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,471
She'll be cooking. I'll be running
the joint like Rick in Casablanca.

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,359
- Might as well get paid for it.
- I'm serious.

187
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,353
- It’s serious.
- I'll be the first customer.

188
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,999
I was thinking of fixing
Ted up with Helen Dubin.

189
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,278
Then I figured they would get into
an argument over penis envy.

190
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,150
- The poor guy suffers from it so.
- Did he seem a little too cheerful?

191
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,880
He seemed like
his regular self to me...

192
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,794
...but when you brought up
the restaurant, the guy lit up.

193
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,279
The restaurant?

194
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,716
He sees himself as
Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.

195
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,957
I see him as Peter Lorre,
wringing his hands.

196
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,591
I mean, Mr. House. Didn't he seem
a little too cheerful to you?

197
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,069
- Our next-door widower?
- Yes.

198
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,189
I mean, didn't he seem too composed
for a man whose wife just died?

199
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,716
What do you want him to do?
Walk down the street sobbing?

200
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,034
All I know is they were supposedly
looking forward to their anniversary...

201
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,909
If I dropped dead, wouldn't
you sob for months or years...

202
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,514
Don't make those jokes.
I don't like them.

203
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,433
I'm the guy who needs
a physical checkup.

204
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,037
I don't know. To me he seemed
a little too perky. You know?

205
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,955
Suddenly, he wants his desserts and,
"Have a nice time at the opera."

206
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,432
And, "We're certainly dressed up."
This guy should be a wreck.

207
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,993
Right. Meanwhile, I can't get The Flying
Dutchman theme out of my mind.

208
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,359
Remind me tomorrow to buy all the Wagner
records in town and rent a chain saw.

209
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,233
Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.

210
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,755
- She's mousy.
- He's a little mousy.

211
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,037
They can have rodent time
and eat cheese together.

212
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,760
Oh, Christ.

213
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,512
Hello?

214
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,797
Yes. Yes, yes, of course, you woke us.

215
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,751
Not everybody is up at 1:00 in the
morning watching porn. I'll put her on.

216
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,718
- Who is it?
- Ted. For you.

217
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,108
Ted, hi.

218
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,352
I figured out how he made it
look like a coronary.

219
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,557
He gagged her and tied her
to the treadmill...

220
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,354
...and turned it up to Olympic levels.

221
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,070
No, no. You know, I mean,
I just think this guy is too perky.

222
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,951
You know? I mean, he's not acting like
a man whose beloved of 28 years died...

223
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,998
Are you onto that?
I thought you were joking.

224
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,878
- I know.
- Let me speak to him.

225
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,759
What? Here.
Just a sec. Here's Larry.

226
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,309
Listen, she was not murdered.

227
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,110
It was a coronary, there was
a doctor there. He was an old man.

228
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,829
- Do you know he's a real doctor?
- I'm not gonna touch that.

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,228
I want to go to sleep.

230
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,516
Wait a minute.
Put Carol back on.

231
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,240
I called about something else.

232
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,393
Listen, I know a great location
for a restaurant.

233
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,789
Look at this.
Isn't this great?

234
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,428
- It’s dark.
- Aren't these walls great?

235
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,591
- Like you go through a cave.
- I see.

236
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,479
- Then you come out to this.
- Look at this.

237
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,870
- It’s beautiful.
- Isn't it great?

238
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,238
- It’s out of the way for a restaurant.
- No. That’s the appeal.

239
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,631
It’s so romantic,
tucked away back here like this.

240
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,677
You don't want street trade.

241
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,150
You want a spot people hear about
and lovers go to.

242
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,756
- It takes months to get a reservation.
- You thought this out.

243
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,037
I came here with Julie
when we were married.

244
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,838
Used to walk around here.

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,878
- Really beautiful at night.
- I bet.

246
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,749
I'd think, "Why are we here?
We don't love each other."

247
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,878
It made the moment doubly poignant.

248
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,473
Hi. How are you?

249
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,076
These are my "floating islands."
I hope you like meringue.

250
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,515
- I love it. Come on in.
- Well, okay.

251
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,193
- Unbelievable.
- I know...

252
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,237
- Did you do this?
- I did.

253
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,119
I told you.
Anyway, this is vanilla sauce.

254
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,269
Come on in.

255
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,271
- I put chocolate truffles...
- Share it.

256
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,193
- She made these for you.
- It’s too much.

257
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,430
- I'll make coffee.
- I'll make it.

258
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,874
- Let me make it.
- You've done so much.

259
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,713
I insist. Sit down. Relax.
Enjoy yourself.

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,270
- Aren't you nice.
- You've been through enough.

261
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,670
- How're you holding up?
- I don't know.

262
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,470
I was thinking after a while, I'd get
away. This place and its memories.

263
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,235
- You have someone to go with, or...?
- A brother in Florida.

264
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,517
I'm hoping he can get away.
Do you like snorkeling?

265
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,389
No. I get nervous when
brightly coloured fish stare at me.

266
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,836
- I've got stamps to show you.
- Stamps? Well.

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,230
Look at these.

268
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,750
Okay.

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,595
Coffee. Is that here?

270
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,398
- This is delicious. You are an artist.
- Well, thanks very much.

271
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,474
- Was it a large funeral?
- Oh, no.

272
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,713
- We had few friends. No family.
- Right. Just a simple affair.

273
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,519
- They're the best, aren't they?
- Yeah.

274
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,116
I guess. Anyway,
then you're laid to rest and...

275
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,193
You know, I was just...
Where are the twin cemetery plots?

276
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,036
We were thinking that that was just
such a romantic idea. Weren't we?

277
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,116
Remember when we talked about the twin
cemetery plots and how romantic that is?

278
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,840
- Remember?
- Yes. Yes. We were.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,389
Spending eternity with the beloved.

280
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,074
- I sound like one of those guys.
- Yes.

281
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,835
Yeah, but I was just wondering,
where is the cemetery?

282
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,673
It’s in Nyack.

283
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,877
We used to summer
there occasionally.

284
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,113
What was that
about twin cemetery plots?

285
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,432
I knew you were trying to tell me
something, so I picked up on it quickly.

286
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,717
I was in the kitchen making the coffee.

287
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,555
There were no beans,
so I was looking in his cupboards.

288
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,953
And I came across this urn, okay? And
I opened it and there were ashes in it.

289
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,590
- Ashes? Did you wash your hands?
- He had her cremated!

290
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,958
How did you know it was her?
Did they resemble Mrs. House?

291
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,190
- Who else would it be?
- Anybody.

292
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,909
Could be a relative.
His accountant. His cat.

293
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,152
- Right. Hidden? Hidden away?
- What do you mean?

294
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,111
- The guy didn't do anything.
- All I know is, he lied. Okay? He lied.

295
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,077
Maybe he's embarrassed.

296
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,710
Maybe he didn't want to spend
eternity next to the beloved.

297
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,276
So he told us that.
You know, what’s the difference?

298
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,635
- Who are you calling?
- Ted.

299
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,076
Jesus. Leave the guy alone.

300
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,870
He's a poor widower. He wants
to go on a vacation or something.

301
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,112
Yeah? Where? I know where.
Snorkeling, right?

302
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,718
So what? He has fun sitting
at the bottom of the water with squid.

303
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,348
I know. I know. What about this?

304
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,310
- What if they had a big insurance policy?
- Too much Double Indemnity.

305
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,392
Hi. Yeah. Hi, it’s me.

306
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,836
We were just in our neighbor’s
apartment, right?

307
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,310
Get this. I came across
an urn with ashes in it.

308
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,109
Only, he says he had his wife buried.

309
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,352
That’s what you do
if you don't want an autopsy.

310
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,557
You don't want something discovered.
Like poison.

311
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,911
Right. They'd have detected poison,
wouldn't they?

312
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,595
I don't know.
There are a lot of exotic poisons.

313
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,957
But why would he lie?
Why would he lie at all?

314
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,078
You guys are slipping
into a mad obsession.

315
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,755
Would you do that?
I'm not good at that kind of thing.

316
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,232
All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk
to you later. Okay, bye.

317
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,868
- Could we go to bed now?
- I'm not tired.

318
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,555
- What do you mean?
- They gonna call the funeral home.

319
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,837
I don't know why
you're not fascinated with this.

320
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,438
- We could be living next to a murderer.
- New York's a melting pot. Get used to it.

321
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,753
Oh, my God.

322
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,708
- Hey, are you okay?
- Larry. Larry, I heard a noise.

323
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,398
I heard a noise in the hall. I think
Mr. House was getting on the elevator.

324
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,155
- You sure?
- I'm almost certain it was him.

325
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,108
So what? It’s not a crime.
He can get on the elevator.

326
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,272
- Who would at 1:30 a.m.?
- I was in a deep sleep.

327
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,429
What’s the difference?

328
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,309
You know how we complain
about the geriatric floor? That joke?

329
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,953
So it was him. He got on the elevator.
It’s not a felony. He's entitled.

330
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,554
Can you go back to bed?
This is crazy.

331
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,589
- I gotta get up early tomorrow.
- I know what I'm gonna do.

332
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,433
I'm gonna ring his apartment,
see if he's home.

333
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,716
- Now?
- Yes, because this is...

334
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,598
- What?
- It’s very sue...

335
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,638
- What are you doing? Don't ring...
- Don't!

336
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,158
Don't ring Mr. House. He's a widower.
Leave him alone. You're crazy. Stop!

337
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,392
- So you saw him. It’s not a crime.
- He's not there.

338
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,710
- Give me this.
- What are you doing?

339
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,553
If you want to find out who left,
call downstairs.

340
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,030
- I'll call. Keep ringing.
- I'm gonna keep ringing.

341
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,872
What’s gotten into you?

342
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,634
Where is this guy at 1:30 a.m.?

343
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,509
It’s not your business.
He can go any place he wants.

344
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,355
Hello? Yes, hello.
This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes.

345
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,910
Did anybody just leave the building?
I'm just...

346
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,791
You're sure? You're sure no one...?
No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you.

347
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,350
- Are you happy? Can we go to bed?
- I don't get it.

348
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,637
You're making a mystery
where nothing exists.

349
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,796
Okay, I got it. Wait. I know it.
No, wait. Listen to me. Larry, listen.

350
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,394
- He got on the elevator. Wait. Listen!
- I'm gonna go to sleep.

351
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,357
I don't want to stand here.

352
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,796
He got on the elevator
and took it to the basement.

353
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,988
- Great. So what? Now what’ve you got?
- He has a car and the garage key.

354
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,355
- He opened...
- So what? So what?

355
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,509
What do you mean, "So what?"

356
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,309
He went out in the night
and took his car someplace.

357
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,110
- All right. So I'm right, though.
- So you're right. So big deal.

358
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,113
This "right" is gonna put us
in the toilet.

359
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,034
- It says more about you than him.
- What about your rigidity?

360
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,034
- How about that point?
- Get into bed. What’s wrong with you?

361
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,156
Hi.

362
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,029
Jack? Could you come upstairs today?
I got a leak in the kitchen.

363
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,079
- Well, yeah. Sure.
- Well, but it will be this afternoon?

364
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,559
- I'll be back in a minute.
- A minute.

365
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,669
- Wait a second. I'll be right back.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,355
Oh, God.

367
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,751
- Hello?
- Ted, I'm in his apartment.

368
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,710
The urn is missing. It’s gone.
Yeah, I think it might have been.

369
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,715
He had this satchel last night.
That might have been what he had in it.

370
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,269
I'd get out of there if I were you.

371
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,910
No, no, no. Go.
We'll talk more from your apartment.

372
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,594
He's not going snorkeling
with his brother.

373
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,675
He's got two tickets to Paris and
reservations at the Georges V Hotel...

374
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,990
...with a woman named Helen Moss.

375
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,678
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

376
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
Good. You got the notice
on the maintenance increase?

377
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,914
When did that happen?

378
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,389
I'm gonna see what else I can dig up.

379
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,031
Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just...
I'm just dizzy with freedom.

380
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,317
This is the craziest thing
I've ever done.

381
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,952
Yes, it’s crazy. But soon we'll be too
old to do anything crazy. Go. Leave.

382
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,791
Hello.

383
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,837
Oh, hi. Yeah.

384
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,039
I know, l...
Yes, I miss you too.

385
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,555
I did. I made all the arrangements.

386
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,357
Yeah, look, l...
Okay, I have to run.

387
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
But I'll see you later, okay?

388
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,356
Okay.

389
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,354
Extension five.

390
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,309
Keep ringing, would you please?

391
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,040
Because I just talked to her.

392
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,676
What?

393
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,956
Okay.

394
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,749
Would you tell her...?
Yes, tell her that Tom called.

395
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,558
Tom.

396
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,869
Thank you.

397
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,272
Your rewrites were great.
You helped your book. It’s dense, but...

398
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,877
- I don't want it to be transparent...
- You'll never have to worry about that.

399
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,192
This book makes Finnegan's Wak e look
like airplane reading. But it’s long...

400
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,239
You're the only editor I take suggestions
from, but you shouldn't push it.

401
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,359
I'm not pushing. The book
is absolutely great. You know, but...

402
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,999
How much of Dorothy is you?

403
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,312
As I read, I kept thinking,
how much did you base on your life?

404
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,271
Well, I was a waitress. I lived
with a poet. I was a film critic.

405
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,192
But not a blackjack dealer?

406
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,352
No, but I put myself through
school playing poker.

407
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,830
- Do you still play?
- No, but I still know how.

408
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,357
Yes? Are you good?
Maybe you could give me pointers.

409
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,954
I could turn your game around
in two hours.

410
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,237
Could you? That’s great.
That’s, you know...

411
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,030
You have all these skills and you're
beautiful and you can write well...

412
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,237
...and you play poker.
It’s too good to be true.

413
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,755
- I wouldn't say beautiful.
- I would.

414
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,673
But I do have tremendous sex appeal.

415
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,355
Okay. You sold me.

416
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,511
Are you seeing anybody?

417
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,515
No. Don't let my confidence fool you.
It’s a façade. Why do you ask?

418
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,277
I have a friend who became single recently,
and he would get a kick out of you.

419
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,750
So when do you want
your poker lessons?

420
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,276
Next week. I could take you to lunch.
We could...

421
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,389
I'll put you on my expense account and
you could teach me when to bet or fold.

422
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,076
- How about a cheeseburger right now?
- Now? That’s a possibility.

423
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,198
You know, we could...
Hello?

424
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,115
Yes.

425
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,436
Where are you?

426
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,955
Is everything okay?

427
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,997
Really?

428
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,958
No, I could. Sure. I could.

429
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,557
Yeah. I need, you know,
five minutes or so. Okay.

430
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,518
Yes, I know where it is.
Okay, hold on.

431
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,638
I can't do it. My wife...
I have a thing I have to do.

432
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,712
I'll do the cheeseburger
with you next week.

433
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,440
Story of my life.

434
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,879
You snuck into his apartment?
Are you nuts?

435
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,679
- Stop being a fuddy-dud.
- A fuddy-dud?

436
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,752
What are you talking about?
That’s a crime.

437
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,036
That’s breaking and entering.

438
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,239
What has gotten into you?
Save a little craziness for menopause.

439
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,834
I took the key and I let myself in.

440
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,390
Hey, look...
You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti.

441
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,917
You can't just steal a key
and go into somebody's apartment.

442
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,548
He's not going snorkeling
with his brother.

443
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,676
I don't want to be an accessory.

444
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,559
He's going to Paris with a woman
named Helen Moss.

445
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,314
- Tell Ted. I don't want to know.
- I did.

446
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,314
- You told Ted before me?
- Yeah, he's more open-minded.

447
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,474
I know. I'm a bore. I don't break
the law. I live within the Constitution.

448
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,996
- Plus, he got rid of the urn.
- I don't want to hear.

449
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,118
- He talked on the phone with a woman.
- How do you know?

450
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,794
- He came back while I was there.
- He did?

451
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,155
- I hid under the bed.
- Under his bed?

452
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,676
He didn't see me, Larry.
He didn't see me at all.

453
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,798
I cannot believe this.
My stomach is curdling.

454
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,111
He was very lovey-dovey
with this kind of bimbo.

455
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,229
He kept saying stuff like, " Don't worry.
It’ll be all right. We'll be together."

456
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,518
- What if he found you?
- I couldn't think that far ahead.

457
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,877
That far ahead?
You're talking two seconds.

458
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,076
Yeah, but Larry, listen to this.

459
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,710
He called this woman back.
Probably this Helen Moss.

460
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,279
I don't want to know.

461
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,318
And when he calls her back,
she's not there.

462
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,153
Then he leaves this message and says:

463
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,108
"Tell her Tom called."
You know what I'm saying? Tom!

464
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,751
I get it. His name is Paul. But I
don't care. I don't want to hear.

465
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,435
I thought I did a great job,
and so did Ted.

466
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,239
A private eye
couldn't have done better.

467
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,871
I put everything back where I found it.
I was careful. I made one mistake.

468
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,875
- What?
- I left my reading glasses on his table.

469
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,195
I thought I'd bring chocolate mousse.
I know you enjoyed the last dessert.

470
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,193
I thought I'd give you another
something delicious.

471
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,909
Do you want me to serve that?
You should while it’s fresh.

472
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,389
- We can all have some.
- That’d be great.

473
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,913
- I'll get plates.
- Good.

474
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,756
- That’s great.
- Over here. I put them here somewhere.

475
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,075
How are you doing in there?
You need any help?

476
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,755
- No, I'm fine. I'll be right in.
- Okay, great.

477
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,310
No. You're going to ruin everything.

478
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,109
What are you doing?

479
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,951
- Are you okay? Can we do anything?
- Coffee or tea?

480
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,192
- I'd like some tea.
- You know, I found your glasses.

481
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,793
- Mine?
- Are these yours?

482
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,350
- Yes! No, no, no.
- Those aren't yours. These are the same.

483
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,636
- These ones are.
- They are mine.

484
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,349
- What a coincidence.
- I think the other night I left them.

485
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,318
- I didn't notice.
- It was the strangest thing.

486
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,313
You thought I left them
at your mother's house.

487
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,516
- Of course.
- That mousse looks fabulous.

488
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,829
- I love mousse.
- Thank you.

489
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,197
- Are you looking forward to snorkeling?
- Very much.

490
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,113
It’s funny. I found
those glasses under my bed.

491
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,431
I must have dropped them
and they got kicked under.

492
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,752
- They were...
- She drops things and kicks them around.

493
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,433
- Mousse?
- I'd love some.

494
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,114
Remember when you kicked
mousse under the bed?

495
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,510
- I remember.
- Took six months to get...

496
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,391
- Sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder.
- I know. Where are we going?

497
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,394
I looked up Helen Moss in
the phone book. It was "H. Moss."

498
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,109
It’s Bank Street.
We're going to do surveillance.

499
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,909
I got a whole lot of food. It’s great.

500
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,073
- There's her house.
- Right. So we just sit and wait? Okay.

501
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,793
Maybe he thought if he divorced her,
she'd hit him for alimony.

502
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,636
- Maybe she controls the family fortune.
- Yeah. Maybe we're wrong, Ted.

503
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,112
Maybe she died of natural causes
like the doctor said and we have...

504
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,835
...hyperactive imaginations
whose lives need adrenaline.

505
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,072
- Does yours? Mine needs something.
- What’s that?

506
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,118
Jelly doughnuts.
You want a jelly doughnut?

507
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,840
- Come on. You gotta get into it.
- Okay.

508
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,549
- Oh, my God. Look. Look!
- What? What?

509
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,156
- Helen! Helen! Duck, duck!
- Ted! Oh, God.

510
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,550
Helen!

511
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,711
- It’s not her.
- It’s not her?

512
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,110
No, it’s not her.

513
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,032
- What?
- Oh, God.

514
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,752
You really have
this worked out, don't you?

515
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,119
I figured she'd come out
and go to work.

516
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,274
Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's
like you and she has writer's hours.

517
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,796
I'm writing a play about something
that happened to us.

518
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,315
God. Oh, dear. What?

519
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,918
Remember when you and I and Larry and
Julie were on that eating tour of France?

520
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,196
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,874
And they wandered off
and forgot to pick us up?

522
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,473
We shared that
bed-and-breakfast place.

523
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,108
Remember those wonderful cottages?

524
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,876
And I remember that we shared
a bedroom together, right?

525
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,029
- Not a bed.
- No, not a...

526
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,591
Well, God, you were too
gentlemanly to suggest that.

527
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,116
- It’s not that I didn't think of it.
- No.

528
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,352
I knew what was going on
because of the way...

529
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,637
...you kept plying me
with Château Margaux.

530
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,555
It could have been our little secret.
Then you passed out.

531
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,311
Yeah, God. It seems like
a long time ago, doesn't it?

532
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,113
Not that long ago.

533
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,309
Look. Look, look, look.

534
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,515
What?

535
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,479
- Helen! Duck.
- God, yeah. Right.

536
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,870
- She didn't see us.
- No?

537
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,068
- That’s gotta be her. She answers to Helen.
- She answers to Helen. She's pretty.

538
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,310
- Yeah.
- She's...

539
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,711
- What is she doing?
- She's getting a cab. Keep down.

540
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,350
- Okay, don't worry.
- I'm gonna follow her.

541
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,196
Watch your step.
It’s very steep. Be careful.

542
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,999
- This is beautiful.
- Isn't it?

543
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,152
We show revivals.
This week we have Fred Astaire.

544
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,595
Next we have an Orson Welles festival.

545
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,197
I think that will be about the last
thing we do before renovating.

546
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,674
- Paul.
- Come on, there's nobody around.

547
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,592
Okay.

548
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,516
- I've never been behind a movie screen.
- Strange, isn't it?

549
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,390
It used to be a first-run house
when the neighbourhood was better.

550
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,394
- All these mirrors.
- It used to be all mirrors. Beautiful.

551
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,075
I'm having this broken glass
replaced as we go along.

552
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,711
They used to have stage shows here.
Now we only show old movies.

553
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,159
- It has such a lonely feeling.
- I'm the only one here. And Mrs. Dalton.

554
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,834
I'll have it fixed up.
Then I'll sell it.

555
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,675
- The money is gonna come in handy.
- It sure will.

556
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,400
- What’s that noise?
- Where?

557
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,869
Mrs. Dalton, I didn't know
you were here.

558
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,679
I didn't know anyone
was here. I'm sorry.

559
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,799
- I heard a noise, but I apologize.
- It’s quite all right.

560
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,994
I'd love to really get an acting job.

561
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,869
- I've had it with modeling.
- Maybe you won't have to work at all.

562
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,509
Oh, my God.

563
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,680
- What’s the matter?
- Come with me, okay?

564
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,875
- Jeez.
- Come on.

565
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,793
I was asleep,
dreaming of round card girls.

566
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,794
Okay. It looks like he's gone.
Yeah. Yeah, he's gone.

567
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,589
- Not that again.
- I want another look at his apartment.

568
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,196
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

569
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,555
- He'll never be back, Larry.
- What?

570
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,632
- No, he's not coming back.
- You got his key?

571
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,870
- Yeah.
- You're kidding. You can't...

572
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,397
You followed him to the movie house.
You said nothing happened.

573
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,315
No, he was with this young model type,
and they were talking about money.

574
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,710
- Well, so what?
- That’s the motive.

575
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,836
- Listen.
- What are you talking about?

576
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,877
- Wait.
- What do you mean?

577
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,999
You gotta go to your shrink.
I want you to see Dr. Ballard.

578
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,549
Larry, I went for two years.

579
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,280
You know how General Motors
will recall cars?

580
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,115
- You gotta go in.
- We'll be out in five minutes. Five.

581
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,477
I'm your husband.
I command you to sleep. Sleep.

582
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,358
I command it. Sleep!

583
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,229
If this had been a few years ago,
you would do the same thing.

584
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,871
Because if you recall, we solved
a mystery. We solved a mystery once.

585
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,554
It was the " noises
in the attic" mystery.

586
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,996
The country house. The bluebird.
That was a sweet mystery.

587
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,594
This is murder.

588
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,356
- You agree, right? It’s murder, Larry.
- I forbid you! I forbid you to go!

589
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,114
Is that what you do when I forbid you?

590
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,875
I'm not going to be
forbidding you a lot if you do...

591
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,513
- Damn it.
- Don't do this.

592
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,638
We should be asleep,
in our cuddling position.

593
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,156
Please be quiet.
You're gonna wake up the neighbours.

594
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,197
- I got it.
- This is no good.

595
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,113
This could only lead
to great unhappiness.

596
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,238
- Relax, okay?
- I can't relax. How can I relax?

597
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,279
I'm in a strange man's apartment
in my T-shirt and pyjamas.

598
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,991
- Ted told me to try something here.
- Ted? What is he, your mentor?

599
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,516
- Ted is a sick schmuck.
- Just be quiet, all right?

600
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,673
- What if he comes back? My heart is...
- Larry.

601
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,558
- Waldron?
- Who?

602
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,156
- Who is this? Who do you want?
- Who's this?

603
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,108
- Do you know anybody named Waldron?
- Hang the phone up.

604
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,477
- Great. Now they hung up on us.
- Good, good.

605
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,313
Let me think.
Waldron, right? Helen Moss.

606
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,630
He used the name Tom.
Tom Waldron.

607
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,872
- We gotta run a check on that.
- You want to beat it to the morgue?

608
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,838
You got all the jargon.
Where are you going?

609
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,918
I'm not a night person.
I don't want to be...

610
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,310
I don't know what I'm looking for.

611
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,268
- Wait. Look.
- Are you gonna go through the guy's mail?

612
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,509
This is insane.

613
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,399
- What do you mean?
- Jesus! Oh, Christ!

614
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,757
- Clean it up. Hurry up.
- What am I gonna do? Vacuum?

615
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,798
- Put it under the rug.
- It’s a wall-to-wall carpet.

616
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,952
- I broke his porcelain...
- Well, then, glue it.

617
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,953
- What do you mean, glue it?
- Look.

618
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,633
- What?
- Look.

619
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,314
So what. Gloves.
I have gloves.

620
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,313
Do you keep yours out
in this kind of weather?

621
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,199
- Let’s get out.
- Something's strange here.

622
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,113
He left these out.
The whole thing is sinister.

623
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,750
It’s eye of the beholder.
You have to get happy glasses.

624
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,878
I'm gonna take the pieces.
We'll get rid of them.

625
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,032
- How did you like your birthday cake?
- I loved it.

626
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,033
- But I love chocolate anything.
- I know.

627
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,954
- What are you laughing about?
- Lf only he could stay in town.

628
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,556
They're working us so hard at school.
I gotta get back.

629
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,439
I'm gonna take him
to Brooks Brothers for his present.

630
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,149
She's going to a wine tasting.
Can you believe that?

631
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,313
If I'm gonna be a restaurant owner,
I should know about wines.

632
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,629
- Hey.
- Hi.

633
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,950
- I want you to meet somebody.
- What?

634
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,190
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi. How are you?

635
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,035
- Good. How are you doing?
- This is my wife.

636
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,112
- Carol. Remember me?
- This is Marcia Fox.

637
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,713
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

638
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,997
It’s his birthday,
so we took him to 21.

639
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,073
Your friend called me.
He's taking me to dinner in New Jersey.

640
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,470
- I fixed her up with Ted.
- You did?

641
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,870
- That place we ate at.
- Lovely.

642
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,190
- You'll have a good time.
- Great.

643
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,238
- Well, good to see you.
- Take care. Goodbye.

644
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,075
- She'll have a great time.
- So that’s Marcia Fox, huh?

645
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,949
- What are you making a face for?
- You think she's her type?

646
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,237
She's anybody's type.
She's brilliant, talented.

647
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,518
- You know, your pupils are dilating.
- She's dangerously sexual.

648
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,117
When you go to the wine tasting,
getting back to real life, spit it out.

649
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,271
- Don't drink too much.
- What do you mean?

650
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,879
I don't want you on the bathroom floor
with your head by the bowl tonight.

651
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,788
- That Mouton '45.
- Did you love it?

652
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,633
- That was like, sublime, you know?
- Yeah.

653
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,997
The inexpensive Spanish one.
Wasn't that a surprise?

654
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,594
Wasn't that great?
Look at these paintings.

655
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,876
- So...
- I love the blue in that.

656
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,113
- Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox?
- Yeah, well, you know.

657
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,669
He says she's wonderful. And I'm...

658
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,469
I'm trying to meet people.
I'm not looking forward to this.

659
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,758
- So you're taking her to Vincent’s?
- Yeah. I guess.

660
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,593
- She's not my first choice.
- No?

661
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,074
God, look at this.
That park is so beautiful.

662
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,751
- I can't have my first choice.
- No?

663
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,473
- I'm drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.
- So am I. I don't know about this.

664
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,232
- I'm gonna be late for my shrink.
- You've gotta go?

665
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,437
- Yeah.
- Okay.

666
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,474
You know, you would be
my first choice.

667
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,314
- Me, huh?
- Yeah.

668
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,198
Well.

669
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,196
Oh, boy.

670
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,789
Can I give you a lift?
I'm gonna go east.

671
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,999
No, I think I'll stick around.
I feel a little tipsy.

672
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,835
- I didn't offend you by what I said?
- No.

673
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,472
You didn't offend me. No, I was
very flattered by this, Ted. Flattered.

674
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,756
- Well, anyway...
- See you later.

675
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,789
- See you. Careful.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

676
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,796
I got a great sweater
at Brooks Brothers for Nick.

677
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,715
It’s cashmere. Very expensive.
The kid looked so handsome in it.

678
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,952
I decided I'd cook tonight.
Tuna casserole.

679
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,078
- Well, no wonder he had her cremated.
- What?

680
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,309
Mrs. House.

681
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,789
You're not on about
Mrs. House again?

682
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,633
I thought we'd have a light dinner...

683
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,510
- Larry. I just saw Mrs. House.
- What are you talking about? The ashes?

684
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,478
A bus passed me and she was on it.

685
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,235
The dead woman passed you on a bus?
The bus to heaven?

686
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,110
I'm not joking. I'm telling you,
I really saw her. I actually saw her.

687
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,398
You wanna lie down for a while?
Cold compress or hot compress...

688
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,553
I was at the wine tasting, right?
And I was sitting at a bay window.

689
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,510
I happened to look out. A bus passed,
and she was on it, Larry...

690
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,114
Yes, remember I said to you,
spit it out?

691
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,511
You said you were going
to taste wine all afternoon?

692
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,752
You swallowed it.
That’s why you're this way.

693
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,753
Yeah, I had a few drinks, but...
I saw her.

694
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,040
Yeah, I'm sure you saw her. How could
you? She's dead. And cremated.

695
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,829
Are you telling me that
I didn't see her? Is that it?

696
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,074
I think it’s a fair assumption that if
a person is dead, they don't turn up.

697
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,676
I just don't know
what’s happening, Larry.

698
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,476
What’s going on? Let me put it this way.
Total psychotic breakdown. Okay?

699
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,915
Maybe she's a twin.
Now, forget this.

700
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,117
Tell me if I put in too much fudge
in my casserole.

701
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,393
You're getting so close-minded
these days. I just... Oh, God.

702
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,438
- Hello? Ted.
- Ted.

703
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,149
You're not going to believe this,
but I saw Mrs. House.

704
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,198
Yeah, Mrs. House.
The murdered woman. Right.

705
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,275
She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary.
I don't know what she's talking about.

706
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,193
No, I'm sure I saw her.
She was on a bus.

707
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,874
I saw her just moments after you left.

708
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,589
Right. He was at the wine tasting too.
Sure, why not.

709
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,435
Would you? Great. Run a check
on Paul and Lillian House...

710
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,639
Don't run a check. Can you call back?
My marriage is falling apart.

711
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,554
If you're gonna have an affair,
you don't need a murder to do it.

712
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,359
I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.

713
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,910
Yes, I know. On the dead persons' bus.
Now, sit down.

714
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,038
I can show you the exact spot, Larry.

715
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,557
- What about lunch? Tomorrow?
- No, I've got a business lunch.

716
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,314
This is just such a shock.

717
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,234
- I'm vibrating from this.
- We got tickets to the theatre.

718
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,675
What? I'm not going to the theatre.

719
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,400
We've been holding onto these tickets
for months.

720
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,349
Do you comprehend the enormity
of what I'm telling you?

721
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,348
- Tell the police, not me.
- What am I going to say to them?

722
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,438
- Tell them your story.
- I don't have a story.

723
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,115
- I got nothing.
- That’s right, you've got nothing.

724
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,033
- Unless I locate her, huh?
- Yeah, okay.

725
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,068
- Okay?
- Sit down. We're going to the theatre.

726
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,912
Jack, you were there when Mrs. House
died, right? You saw her?

727
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,799
- You saw her?
- She was lying on the floor.

728
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,679
- You're sure it was her, right?
- I'm sure.

729
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,189
- He's sure.
- Right. Right.

730
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,951
My wife's had bad dreams and
doesn't know what she's talking about.

731
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,632
This is for the times I call you to fix
the faucet and you show up months late.

732
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,035
The super is a drunk.

733
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,989
But we've seen him smelling
of Jack Daniel's. Remember?

734
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,758
- Yeah, but...
- Well...

735
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,233
- I know he didn't see Mrs. House.
- Lf she's a twin, it’s a different story.

736
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,948
- You don't feel she is.
- I don't know.

737
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,718
Oh, I know.

738
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,557
Unless he's in on it.

739
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,509
The super's in on it?
The super can't change a fuse.

740
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,148
I mean, she...

741
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,710
- What?
- Well, she's alive. My question is:

742
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,550
- Who was in that bag? I mean...
- She's not alive unless she's a twin.

743
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,509
- Okay? Now, keep quiet.
- Look, somebody...

744
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,830
Somebody got cremated, Larry.
Somebody.

745
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,310
Shut up.

746
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,908
Lillian House. Maiden name Lillian
Beale. Born in Pennsylvania, 1935.

747
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,839
Married Paul House.
She was not a twin.

748
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:20,315
Had a sister who went to England 20
years ago, a brother who died in 1987.

749
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,114
- This is it.
- This is where we were.

750
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,757
I know. And I was sitting there
after you left, having some wine.

751
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,231
- I looked out and saw...
- You saw her after I left?

752
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,552
I saw her on a bus. It was passing...

753
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,949
It was, like...

754
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,668
You're absolutely sure you saw her?

755
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,757
- You saw her face?
- I saw her.

756
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,359
Excuse me.

757
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,398
- I'm telling you.
- What was the bus number?

758
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,309
I don't know the number,
but it was heading west to east.

759
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,553
- It obviously was a cross-town bus.
- It’s a cross-town bus.

760
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,951
The end of the line
is a few blocks down.

761
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,115
- She had to get off somewhere.
- Her destination was the next 6 blocks.

762
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,914
So let’s look around.
Maybe we'll see...

763
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,913
...like, you know,
a clue or something.

764
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,439
- Maybe we'll see her. You saw her face?
- Don't doubt me. I'm not kidding.

765
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,717
- I think we reached the end of the line.
- This is it.

766
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,913
- Watch out. Watch...
- Yeah, what? Oh.

767
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,236
Look. See? See, he's turning. That’s it.

768
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,516
- What do you think?
- What?

769
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,109
Think we should retrace our steps?

770
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,436
- You wear a tie with a dress.
- I don't even know if it looks...

771
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,715
- It’d be too masculine with pants.
- Just don't wear it with pants.

772
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,919
Ted.

773
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,917
- Look.
- At what?

774
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,270
- That hotel.
- What about it?

775
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,877
Waldron. I was in his apartment,
I pressed the last number dialled.

776
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,715
- They answered and said "Waldron."
- Let’s get to a phone.

777
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,235
Hello. Mrs. House, please?

778
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,632
Mrs. House.
Can you ring her room for me, please?

779
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,238
- Really?
- Well?

780
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,279
What? Maybe...
Well, maybe she checked out.

781
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,753
- Oh, God.
- Nobody. Nobody at all.

782
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,436
What about...?
Yeah, what about Helen Moss. Moss.

783
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,991
You're sure? Nobody.
Nobody at all. All right.

784
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,720
All right, okay. I'm sorry. Thank you.

785
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,029
Great.

786
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,954
Oh, God. It looks like
it’s gonna rain again.

787
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,792
Well?

788
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,715
If I get two kings, I take one.
Otherwise, I fold. Got it?

789
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,155
I never go out.

790
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,835
- I just, I can't...
- That’s how you wind up on welfare.

791
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,879
But I need the action,
for some reason. Okay, just...

792
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,919
- Cut?
- No, go ahead. I trust you. Lay it on me.

793
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,076
- You seem in a strange mood.
- I'm probably a little drunk.

794
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,630
- On Perrier?
- What? I had rum cake.

795
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,837
- Want any cards?
- One second.

796
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,798
Let me see what possibilities
I got here.

797
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,713
Yeah. I'm gonna have...

798
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,950
I'll have...

799
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,078
- I'm gonna have four cards.
- Four.

800
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:32,032
- Cruisin' for a bruisin'.
- Inside and outside straight.

801
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,749
You're in trouble now.

802
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,676
I can't escape the feeling that my wife
is becoming attracted to somebody else...

803
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,638
...and it’s really bothering me.
- Really?

804
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,872
Yeah, that’s why
I'm not playing my best.

805
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,272
This guy's more adventurous than I am,
and they just hit it off.

806
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,672
I'm gonna be very lonely,
you know, if this happens.

807
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,072
- You must love her a lot.
- Yeah, I do. I do.

808
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,514
If you want to hold on to her,
make some effort. Who's the guy?

809
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,837
- Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.
- Ted?

810
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,232
Well, we could always switch.
Ted gets Carol, I can be your date.

811
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,110
Maybe I should actually make
a greater effort with Carol.

812
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,715
- So you bored?
- It’s more fun than the Wagner opera.

813
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,079
Yeah. Well, to me, it’s one of the most
exciting adventures I've ever been on.

814
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,708
Would you rather be here with Ted?

815
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,474
Well, he has a more enthused attitude.

816
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,039
- More enthused?
- Yeah.

817
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,035
- He's a fun guy. I'm a heavy guy.
- You used to be a lot of fun.

818
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,431
If you have a heavy scavenger hunt,
he's the man.

819
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,953
I know, but...

820
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,998
- Do you know that this neighbourhood...
- What?

821
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,948
...was where I first took you
when we started going out?

822
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,998
You've gotten so stodgy
in your old age.

823
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,233
- Remember there was a movie house...?
- Yes! Yeah, I remember.

824
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,039
I took you to see
Last Year at Marienbad.

825
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,919
I had to explain it to you
for six months.

826
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,038
Who knew they were flashbacks?
You know...

827
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,795
We've got plenty of time
to be conservative. You know?

828
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,511
It’s like this tantalizing plum
has just dropped into our laps.

829
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,150
Life is such a dull routine
and here we are, right?

830
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,073
We're on the threshold
of a genuine mystery.

831
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,754
You gonna burst into song?
We're in a car.

832
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,230
Don't make fun of me.
I'm open to new experiences.

833
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,313
Let me ask a personal question.
Did you ever sleep with Ted?

834
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,517
- Don't get nervous.
- Sleep? What, are you nuts?

835
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,390
We were on an eating tour of France.
You spent an evening together.

836
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,676
I know. What about you?
Remember?

837
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,070
You spent the evening with Julie.

838
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,835
That meant nothing.
Julie despised me. You know that.

839
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,028
She thought I was a lowlife, a roach.
Jump in any time you want to defend me.

840
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,478
I'm waiting for you to say something
I don't agree with, okay?

841
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,916
Hey, you're nailing me. Jesus.

842
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,709
Larry.

843
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,270
Larry, Larry, look.
It’s her! I'd say it’s her!

844
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,876
- Oh, my God, it is.
- See what I mean? I was right.

845
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,873
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Yes.

846
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,396
- Oh, my God.
- Right? Right? I mean, I was...

847
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,473
- Jesus, I'm... That is her.
- I know. Well, come on.

848
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,996
- I told you so.
- What do you mean? You're nuts.

849
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,151
- Oh, Jesus.
- You're white.

850
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,392
I know. All the blood
rushed to my brother.

851
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,313
- Let’s find out what’s going on.
- I don't want to.

852
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,189
- You're not afraid of her?
- No. I'm a virile male.

853
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,591
Yet, somehow, I am scared.
Maybe because she's dead.

854
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,435
- I'm gonna break this thing wide open.
- Well, how?

855
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,797
- God, if only Ted were here.
- Don't give me Ted.

856
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,838
- Let’s get out of here.
- No, I got an idea.

857
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,993
I know. We'll surprise her.
We'll sneak into the hotel.

858
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,720
- How?
- Yeah, no. Come on.

859
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,951
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

860
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:23,035
Did you see a woman come in? She was
a little woman, about five foot three?

861
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,589
- She had on a grey sweater?
- Older?

862
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,514
- Mrs. Caine? Dark hair?
- Mrs. Caine? Oh, yes. That’s her.

863
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,116
- We had a present for her.
- That’s right. What room?

864
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,113
- 611.
- 611. Really. Thanks a lot.

865
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:42,469
We may need information. I'll take good
care of you, if you play ball with us.

866
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,950
- What are you making a face for?
- Will you come on?

867
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,071
- I'm coming.
- What are you doing?

868
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,999
Okay.

869
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,632
- 607.
- Very nice.

870
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,351
I love a hotel that’s got blue powder
sprinkled along the baseboard.

871
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,874
Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.

872
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,438
- Mrs. House?
- Mrs. House?

873
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,074
- Mrs. House?
- Hello.

874
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,710
- Hello? Mrs... My God.
- I don't think she's...

875
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,190
- I don't see her.
- This may not be the right place.

876
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,237
Just hold on, Larry.

877
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,039
- Hold on, hold on.
- There's nothing here.

878
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,589
- Larry! Wait!
- What’s the matter?

879
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,469
Oh, my God, look! Mrs. House?
Mrs. House?

880
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,756
- What’s the matter?
- Hello?

881
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,512
- Larry.
- What?

882
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,513
- I think she's dead.
- Try giving her the present.

883
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,877
- Mrs. House?
- Oh, come on, let’s get out of here!

884
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,314
I think she's dead!

885
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,156
I'm thinking of running the marathon.
This woman is forever dying.

886
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,510
Come on, move. Move.
Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears!

887
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,956
- Get down those stairs. Come on.
- Okay, all right.

888
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,074
What happened was
I suspected Mr. House...

889
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,394
- I'm looking around and suddenly
a hand is on the floor...

890
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,279
- and she has no twin,
but we checked...

891
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,477
- I tried to keep calm.
- There's nobody there.

892
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,438
- What do you mean?
- There's no body there.

893
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,276
- How can there not be anybody there?
- Want to show us where you saw her?

894
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,193
- She was totally dead.
- She's there.

895
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,750
- She was right here.
- She was definitely laying here.

896
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,629
- We're not crazy.
- It looked like she was strangled.

897
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,832
- We're professional people.
- I'm in publishing.

898
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,390
I'm looking to start a restaurant,
basically French.

899
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,870
She's a fantastic cook.
I'm against the restaurant.

900
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,554
Calm down. Calm down! Please!

901
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,396
Look, in the time it took you guys
to respond, somebody removed the body.

902
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,472
Not that you didn't respond quickly.
It took three minutes.

903
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,349
Not counting the half-hour the 911
operator took to understand me.

904
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,354
Nobody is doubting you.
We're going over the building, all right?

905
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,839
All right.

906
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,189
Did you check...?

907
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,477
- He's been at his business all day.
- Any witnesses?

908
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,279
- Corroborated.
- You didn't use our names, did you?

909
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,353
No, we didn't. If you think you saw
his wife, shouldn't you tell him?

910
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,954
No. He's in on some scheme here.

911
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:36,194
We think you should file a report.
Then if anything turns up, it’s on record.

912
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,319
- Give us a call, have a good day.
- Thank you. Thanks very much.

913
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,436
- I don't know how...
- I gotta have a drink.

914
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,751
Where is Ted
when all this stuff is happening?

915
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,597
He's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight.
He's probably out buying Spanish fly.

916
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,435
- Helen Moss might be in on this.
- I don't want to know about this.

917
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,149
We should change our lives.
We should move out.

918
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:04,952
Start over, maybe in Mexico. Sell blankets.
We'll work off the hood of a car.

919
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,350
- I'm just beginning to come down.
- I don't know what’s happening.

920
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,469
It was like a show where you open
the door and see a dead body.

921
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,791
I've never seen a dead
person before in my life.

922
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,157
The only one I ever saw was my
Uncle Morris, who was 94.

923
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,710
He collapsed from too many lumps
in his cereal.

924
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,634
Is this the most exciting thing
that’s ever happened to us?

925
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,109
This is too exciting.

926
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,150
I'd like a fishing trip or Father's Day. Or
the time we saw Bing Crosby on Fifth Ave.

927
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,710
I don't need a murder
to enliven my life at all.

928
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,919
Whoever did it was probably in the room
while we were there, hiding.

929
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,709
Make sure and tell me that
before I go to sleep tonight.

930
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,668
- That means he probably saw us.
- I'll never get my eyes closed.

931
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,912
I'm petrified. Not only that,
but I'm a little drunk.

932
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,629
- I wonder who was cremated. Who was it?
- Well, it was...

933
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,396
- It wasn't Mr. House. He has an alibi.
- Yeah, but I don't buy that.

934
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,313
She doesn't buy the alibi.

935
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,517
Let’s get out of here.
I want to go home.

936
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,833
It’s starting to rain again.

937
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,560
If only Ted were with us.
He'd have a theory.

938
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,109
They got a mind like a steel sieve.

939
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,876
That hotel room was on the end
of the hall. It’s right up there.

940
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,519
- That’s the room.
- I know.

941
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,514
What if they got the body
out over that roof?

942
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,353
What are the lights...?
Larry, the lights!

943
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,273
- That’s eerie.
- This gave me the chills.

944
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,716
- Let’s call the police.
- No, no. Let’s check it out.

945
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,394
Check it out?
I'm not gonna check that out.

946
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,711
- There's lights going on there.
- Yeah, that’s crazy.

947
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,314
Why don't we go home
and call the police...?

948
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,675
No! This is my case.

949
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,673
What do you mean, "your case"?
I don't wanna do this.

950
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,751
If only Ted were with us.

951
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:00,517
Ted would be shaking in his boots.
I'm only trembling like a leaf.

952
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,430
We're with the police department.
We'd like to check out room 611, please.

953
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,353
- You were here before.
- That’s right, yes.

954
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,910
- You are police?
- Just... Show him your card.

955
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,957
- My what?
- Your card.

956
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,635
Your police identification card.

957
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,109
He's got his card.

958
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,670
- Okay.
- Thank you very much. 611.

959
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,071
- Great.
- Is there any trouble?

960
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,199
I'm a detective.
They lowered the height requirement.

961
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,069
I'll take this card back.
They're expensive.

962
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,428
Okay.

963
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,629
- Be careful.
- Telling me to be careful.

964
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,117
- Now, just don't upset anything.
- I'm not.

965
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,876
I'm just gonna leave fingerprints,
so if there's a trial, we can get trapped.

966
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,157
The murderer must have
hid in this closet.

967
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,313
I don't like this. Let’s go.
I gotta be in temple early tomorrow.

968
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,598
He must have dragged
the body out really fast.

969
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,952
I'm sorry! The maid.

970
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,551
You don't have to turn the bed out.
And no croissants for breakfast.

971
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,510
Here, take this for yourself.
Keep the mints coming on the pillows.

972
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,672
- Honey, really.
- Let’s go. That’s why the light was on.

973
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,149
- This is crazy.
- Just a second.

974
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,754
Let me look around here a little bit.

975
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,195
I did damage. L...

976
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,558
- Larry!
- What?

977
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,157
- Larry, look. That’s her wedding band.
- How do you know?

978
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,993
- I saw it on her.
- You did?

979
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,438
So much for the police combing
this place. Where'd you find it?

980
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,556
Behind the door there.

981
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,953
Let’s get out of here. Take the ring.
Maybe there's a pawnshop open.

982
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,598
The police weren't thorough.
They probably thought we were cranks.

983
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,309
We got no body...
They must get 50 crisis calls a minute.

984
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,552
- Why would they bother with us?
- This is very deep stuff.

985
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,518
We should not be here.
This is creepy.

986
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:25,150
Who knows who's involved in this?
This could go very deep.

987
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:29,598
This could be like the Warren Commission.
I don't like it.

988
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,557
- Oh, my God!
- What is that?

989
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,837
- The elevator's probably stuck.
- Why are we stopping?

990
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,911
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax!

991
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,470
- I'm a world-renowned claustrophobic.
- It’s okay.

992
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,996
- Hit something. I don't like this.
- I am hitting it. It’s okay.

993
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,993
It’s easy for you to say,
but I'm phobic.

994
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:51,870
There's plenty of air in this elevator.
Just don't panic, okay?

995
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,429
- I'm not panicking.
- Just don't worry.

996
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,149
- I'm gonna say the rosary now.
- Somebody's gonna help us.

997
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,073
- Somebody'll find us here.
- I don't like this.

998
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,196
- Hello?
- Stop it.

999
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,749
- Hello!
- I can't take this.

1000
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,754
I'm running over a field,
I see a stallion. I'm a stallion.

1001
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,356
Shut up, Larry.
Larry, just shut up and calm down.

1002
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,353
- I see grass, I see dirt.
- Shut up! Hello!

1003
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,034
You said, "Act like a policeman."
I said no.

1004
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,839
You said, "Show them your card."
I said, "What card?"

1005
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,560
Larry, boost me up.
We'll get out there.

1006
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,075
- We'll do it.
- You can't get through that.

1007
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,913
It’ll never open. They're painted shut.

1008
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,595
- They never open.
- All right, put your hand together.

1009
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,433
I'm breathing. I can't breathe.

1010
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,832
Larry, I mean...
All I have to do is loosen that, okay?

1011
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,788
Put your hand together.
Now give me a boost, okay?

1012
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,916
Wait a second! Wait, wait!

1013
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,310
You gotta cut down
on those rich desserts.

1014
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,074
Wait a minute, now!
Wait, wait.

1015
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:57,553
My life is passing in front of my eyes.
The worst part is I'm driving a used car.

1016
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:02,077
- You'd think they'd loosen this thing.
- I'm scared.

1017
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,708
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. It’s her.

1018
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,634
- So that’s where he hid her.
- Claustrophobia and a dead body.

1019
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,268
This is a neurotic's jackpot.

1020
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,556
- I'm scared.
- We're going down.

1021
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,598
Oh, God, what’s happening?
Press up!

1022
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,957
I can't see my hand!
How can I press up?

1023
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:25,877
- We must be heading for the basement.
- I want to get off in the mezzanine.

1024
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,430
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting back on the elevator.

1025
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,591
I can't see anything.

1026
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,478
- There's nothing up here.
- Wait!

1027
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,394
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing with matches?

1028
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,278
These are my matches.

1029
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,637
When were you
at the Café des Artistes?

1030
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,837
- I was with an authoress.
- At the Café des Artistes?

1031
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,753
A French authoress.

1032
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,273
Wait.

1033
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,668
- Jesus.
- This way.

1034
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,435
I like a basement with knotty pine
and a pool table.

1035
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,717
Hey, look. What’s this?

1036
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,273
Not so fast. I don't like it here.
It’s dank and there's strange noises.

1037
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,513
I don't know what this is.
Oh, Jesus!

1038
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,673
- Calm down.
- Calm down? Don't tell me to calm down.

1039
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,512
Found the light.

1040
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,355
Let me see. We're locked in here.
What are we gonna do?

1041
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,717
Relax, relax.
I'll break it down. Stand back.

1042
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,919
Careful, now.
Don't hurt yourself.

1043
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,230
Must be one of those new doors.

1044
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,949
Over here. Let’s try out here.

1045
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,710
Oh, God. I keep hearing noises.

1046
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,711
- What’s down there?
- Where?

1047
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,156
Where are you going?
Don't leave me.

1048
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:51,154
What? I think this
is the service entrance.

1049
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,393
- Come on, get it open. Go into a trot.
- I got it.

1050
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,113
- Let’s go.
- Where?

1051
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,236
- Wait! Do you see that?
- What?

1052
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,712
Somebody's putting a body into a car.
It’s got a white sheet on it.

1053
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,279
Come on.

1054
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,159
That is... Let’s get out of here.

1055
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,996
- No, look! Let’s follow him. Come on.
- I'm not going to follow him.

1056
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:20,039
- There was a body in that car.
- I don't want to follow.

1057
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,519
Hurry up!

1058
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,309
It’s probably a rented car.
And a rented body.

1059
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,914
Come on.

1060
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,957
Oh, Jesus. I can't follow his car.

1061
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,031
- He's right up ahead.
- Where?

1062
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,476
I don't know which car I'm following.
I'm not a good driver.

1063
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,916
I can't chase somebody.
I'm gonna have an accident.

1064
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,833
- I'll hit a school bus.
- It’s night.

1065
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,039
- There's no school buses at night.
- What about night school?

1066
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,877
- You have no sense of direction.
- 20l20 vision. Well, not exactly.

1067
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,077
- No, I do. He came right here.
- Where are we?

1068
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,071
- I don't know. There it is!
- I don't know...

1069
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,753
- There's his car.
- How do you know?

1070
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,832
- That’s his car.
- It is his car. Yes.

1071
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,269
- Let’s get out.
- Be careful. Be careful.

1072
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,190
Look! Look!

1073
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:33,392
Oh, my God! It’s Mrs. House's body!

1074
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,678
Come on! We gotta stop it
before it gets dropped!

1075
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,990
Oh, my God.

1076
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,074
Goodbye, Mrs. House.

1077
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,030
- That was definitely Mr. House!
- What are we gonna do?

1078
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,797
- I'm gonna call the police now.
- And tell them what?

1079
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,511
This guy's got proof his wife died
of a heart attack two weeks ago.

1080
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:34,277
We've got no body. We've got nothing.
What? What? What’s wrong?

1081
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,317
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1082
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,199
- Hello, there. How are you?
- How are you?

1083
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,432
May I introduce Gladys Dalton,
my gal Friday?

1084
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,513
This is Larry and Carol, my neighbours.
We were watching Madame Bovary.

1085
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,035
- Such a sad story.
- Yeah, it is.

1086
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,395
She gets killed at the end.

1087
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,677
You gotta stop up for a drink
before I go on my trip.

1088
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,034
Love to.

1089
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,955
If you hear of anybody who needs
an apartment, I think I may be moving.

1090
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,554
- Come on, Gladys.
- What a shame.

1091
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,280
- Good night.
- Good night.

1092
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,234
Jesus, what a day, huh?

1093
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,233
I can't figure it out.

1094
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,358
- It’s got to be that either he's a...
- What?

1095
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,308
Either she's a twin or he's a twin.

1096
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:30,828
Or they're multiple personalities.
Or you're a twin or I'm a twin.

1097
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,035
- Because I don't know what’s going on.
- You're nuts.

1098
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,713
- Look...
- Wait, yeah...

1099
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:42,078
- Let me be logical about this.
- We know she's not a twin.

1100
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,835
- What are you talking about?
- I want to puzzle this out.

1101
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,993
She's a twin, she's not a twin.
Now you're saying we're twins?!

1102
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:55,075
What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm.
I'm calm. Okay.

1103
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,232
- Yeah, I'm going to be logical.
- All right.

1104
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,197
The first thing is this:

1105
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:05,593
There had been a heart attack. What if
they induced it? Some kind of poison.

1106
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,957
We never saw the body.
It had to be some other woman.

1107
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,033
Some woman who probably had
some resemblance to Mrs. House.

1108
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,953
The super says he saw her,
but he's a drunk.

1109
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,680
Mrs. House could have been hiding.

1110
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,910
You heard a noise that night.

1111
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,598
That had to be Mrs. House
leaving to check into the hotel.

1112
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,469
- I can't sleep, I just...
- Wait. It doesn't make any sense.

1113
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,279
Suddenly he murders her.
What’s it all about?

1114
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,719
Why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia,
get something to eat and talk with them?

1115
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,155
- At 1:00 a.m.?
- So what?

1116
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,595
Ted was taking her to a show
and dinner.

1117
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,117
- You want to schlep out to New Jersey...
- This town never sleeps.

1118
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:52,831
That’s why we don't live in Duluth.
Plus, I don't know where Duluth is.

1119
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,115
Lucky me.

1120
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,153
- You really saw his face?
- No question.

1121
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,074
- I'm here to tell you...
- It was Mr. House. No question.

1122
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,994
There was no way you could avoid it.
He was right there.

1123
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,277
- It’s obvious.
- How obvious? What do you mean?

1124
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,398
Obvious he's committed
the perfect murder.

1125
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,391
- What do you mean?
- Okay, look.

1126
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,076
You have to start with another woman
who resembles Mrs. House.

1127
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,835
That’s what I said.
It was my idea. I said what she said.

1128
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,356
They're with this woman.
Maybe having dinner.

1129
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,718
They don't induce a heart attack.
That’s fiction bullshit.

1130
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,839
She dies spontaneously.
They had no thought of killing her.

1131
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,831
- Maybe they wished she was dead.
- Why?

1132
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,037
Maybe they stood to gain if she died.

1133
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:44,149
They see an opportunity. Mrs. House
dresses her up in her clothes. She hides.

1134
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,233
- This is exactly my theory.
- She checks into a hotel.

1135
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,352
We got that far, with the exception
of the heart attack.

1136
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,990
The husband planning to go
to Paris with this young woman.

1137
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,709
He's cheating on his wife.
Instead of finishing this scheme...

1138
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,509
...he kills her, taking her share
of the profits.

1139
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,672
- Helen Moss is in on this?
- Good chance she's aware.

1140
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,956
What about Mrs. Dalton?
He claims he took her to the movies.

1141
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:12,033
She's his alibi. She covered for him
when he strangled his wife.

1142
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,431
- She said he was at work.
- He introduced her as a colleague.

1143
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,149
- A colleague who maybe loves him.
- He's cheating on her too.

1144
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,596
Cheating on two women?
This guy doesn't look the part.

1145
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,115
He's gotten away
with the perfect murder.

1146
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,593
There are no bodies around, and all
the paperwork's strictly aboveboard.

1147
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:35,390
- Where did you find her? She's a genius.
- She is. But he knows that we know...

1148
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,471
He doesn't care.
Why should he?

1149
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:43,351
Everything's been neatly disposed of. Only
he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth.

1150
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,592
- She's right.
- Hold on. We don't know this is true.

1151
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,309
- This is just a theory.
- Yeah, but it’s a great theory.

1152
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,199
- A great theory.
- Everything fits together.

1153
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,713
I think it’s great.

1154
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,998
When I come back from the ladies' room,
I'll tell you how to trap him.

1155
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,350
- Unbelievable.
- Where did you find her?

1156
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,071
She's really something.
It’s like one thing leads to another.

1157
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,272
I'm surprised you didn't drool
yourselves to death.

1158
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,956
- We just had a nice first date.
- I knew they would hit it off.

1159
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,429
You were gonna jump into her lap.

1160
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,674
What are you talking about?
I'm her editor. I'm a father figure to her.

1161
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,832
The only thing you didn't do
is rub your hands together.

1162
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,673
You're joking.
You're jealous of Marcia?

1163
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,310
- It’s not that I'm jealous.
- What are we doing here?

1164
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,871
Look who's talking. You kept staring
at her like she was the Dragon Lady.

1165
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,793
You're jealous because
he's interested in her?

1166
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,996
- I am not jealous.
- What are you...?

1167
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,958
Do you take all your authors
to the Café des...?

1168
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,190
Okay, I've got it.

1169
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,075
Since he's gotten away with it,
all we can do is bluff.

1170
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,198
As long as we have no body,
we have no case.

1171
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,793
What do you mean?

1172
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,794
We pretend he slipped up?
The molten steel didn't do the job?

1173
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,270
It’s possible. He saw you there.
He knows you're onto him.

1174
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:08,274
- Why couldn't you retrieve the body?
- We couldn't have gotten her out.

1175
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,153
I would wound up with a few toes
and a shoulder.

1176
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,630
What does he know? He was probably
too scared to be very lucid.

1177
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,835
He's an amateur.

1178
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,992
He dumped the body and ran off,
and then somehow...

1179
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,354
...you two dug her out.

1180
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,069
- Now you can send him to the chair.
- I like this woman. She's lurid.

1181
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:29,155
- Let me tell you why he won't believe us.
- I can't bluff or lie without giggling.

1182
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,630
No, because if we really had the body,
why tell him?

1183
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,631
Why not go straight to the police?

1184
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,360
If you tell the cops, you can't
shake him down.

1185
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:42,588
She's wicked. Look how this works out.
You go to the law, what do you gain?

1186
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,468
They put him in jail. What have you got?
You haven't got anything.

1187
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,198
Right.

1188
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,828
But if he wants the evidence,
and has to pay for it...

1189
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,152
...now he's nervous, right?
- There's just so many fallacies in this.

1190
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,072
- What? Name one.
- Name one? Okay.

1191
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,754
The guy looks us straight in the eye
and says, "What body?

1192
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,435
- What are you talking about? Prove it."
- That’s when we keep bluffing.

1193
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,875
- How? What do we do?
- We produce the body.

1194
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,713
But where are we gonna get it?
Madame Tussaut?

1195
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,872
Say we found someone he trusted
to corroborate.

1196
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,837
- Like who?
- Like his lover.

1197
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,754
Say she said, " I've seen Lillian's body.
They want $100,000 for it."

1198
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,956
Why would she do that?

1199
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,916
Remember that book you recommended,
Murder in Manhattan?

1200
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,038
Max Schindler's book.
That’s right, the phone call.

1201
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,430
You never mentioned that book to me.

1202
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,273
- You don't like light reading...
- Since when?

1203
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:38,399
- What is this book?
- It’s fantastic! It would be so perfect...

1204
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,632
...because she's an actress,
a would-be actress...

1205
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,792
We could use his theatre.
He's a playwright. This is so perfect.

1206
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,839
- Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.
- Thank you. That’s great.

1207
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,878
- What are we talking about here?
- Listen to this.

1208
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:57,797
We get her in for a fake audition, and you
write some lines that don't mean anything.

1209
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,633
And she does them,
and we tape-record it.

1210
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,789
- Listen.
- I'm listening.

1211
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:07,398
And then we edit the tape recording up
and we make one end of a phone call...

1212
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,358
...and play it to Mr. House.
- Is it in the book?

1213
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,351
- Come on.
- This is perfect.

1214
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,752
That could never work.
You don't know what he's gonna say.

1215
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,435
- In the book, they use several recorders.
- It’s coordinated.

1216
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:25,754
- You base your plan on a dumb paperback?
- This is great. This is great.

1217
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,836
He's gotten away with murder. Our only
chance is to nab him when he kills again.

1218
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,072
It provokes him to kill again.
They catch him the second time.

1219
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,549
He's gotten away with the first murder.

1220
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,917
You know what I'm thinking?
In the book what happens is...

1221
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,675
...he kills the two people working
the scheme on him.

1222
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,274
But you're not worried about that.

1223
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,676
- It’s perfect.
- Either that, or I've developed Parkinson's.

1224
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:54,799
- No, we can handle him.
- He knows you're onto him, shake him down.

1225
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,555
- He comes after you, we nab him.
- It’s great. You're wonderful. I'm amazed.

1226
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,633
- It’s either that, or he walks.
- So, what you're saying is...

1227
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,836
What you're saying is... Oh, boy.

1228
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,835
You're saying you wanna provoke Mr. House
into trying to murder Larry and me.

1229
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,434
Yeah. Perfect. You're not scared, are you?

1230
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,751
No, I'm not scared.
I'm turning it over in my mind.

1231
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,117
I just want to check with my clergyman
before we commit.

1232
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,153
Hi, B-24, messages? Oh, really?

1233
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,232
Audition for what? Did he say?

1234
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,756
Okay. Wait, hold on. Let me get a pencil.

1235
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,997
Yeah, well, I've heard just about enough
of this.

1236
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,832
Great. Thank you, Suzanne.

1237
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,231
- We'll let you know. Suzanne Raphael, right?
- Thank you.

1238
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,799
Bye.

1239
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,915
- This is Helen Moss.
- Hi, there.

1240
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

1241
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,748
Have you...? I know you
just got the material...

1242
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,198
...just in the last little while, but
have you had a chance to go over it?

1243
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:01,672
- I have, but I have just a few questions.
- Sure, yeah.

1244
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,274
Is she divorced in this?

1245
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,078
Yes. Yes.

1246
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,471
- Recently?
- Yes. Yeah.

1247
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,029
But she's... It’s highly emotional.

1248
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,555
You know, really, a lot of...

1249
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,678
A lot of feeling. Very strong. Okay?

1250
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,755
- Should I just begin?
- Yeah, whenever you feel into it.

1251
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,511
- Hello, Joe? I was just...
- Let me stop you right there. Sorry.

1252
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,433
If you'll start out more frightened...

1253
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,479
...that will take you where you're gonna go.
- Right, right.

1254
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,956
Hello, Joe?

1255
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:56,279
I can't talk much now, and if I
sound strange, don't get alarmed.

1256
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,034
Give me your hand. Hold on.

1257
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,431
- Try not to fall. Hold on.
- "I'm trying, I'm trying."

1258
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,158
Quickly! Hurry!

1259
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,115
They're asking $200,000 for it. Yeah.

1260
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,113
They say it’s Monet, but I say it’s a fake.

1261
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:16,428
Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam,
he's cast a pall on everything.

1262
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,831
A dark cloud. A pall.

1263
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,637
Hello, Joe?

1264
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,999
I can't talk much right now, and if I
sound strange, don't get alarmed.

1265
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,712
Hello, Joe?

1266
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,314
I can't talk much right now...

1267
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,355
Hello, Joe?

1268
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,119
Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam,
he's cast a pall on everything.

1269
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,670
A dark cloud. A pall.

1270
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,671
A pall.

1271
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,793
- Pall.

1272
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,718
- Pall.

1273
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,396
Hello, Joe?

1274
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,913
Hello, Paul?

1275
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:27,358
I can't talk much right now, and if I
sound strange, don't get alarmed.

1276
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,956
- Perfect. Great. Great.
- That’s great.

1277
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,874
- Well, yeah, excuse me.
- It’s fantastic.

1278
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,753
- There she is.
- Where?

1279
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,276
- Keep her busy all afternoon.
- I'll just keep improvising.

1280
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,637
It shouldn't be hard.
She's a hungry actress.

1281
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,191
I'll get her talking about the part,
her life, and her whole background.

1282
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,918
- Stop the car.
- We'll hook up later.

1283
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,196
- Good luck with your side.
- You too.

1284
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,875
Does anybody want some guacamole?

1285
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,918
Stop with the guacamole,
we have to get started.

1286
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,792
- It’s 2:30.
- He should be back.

1287
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,589
- All right, let’s go.
- You got the tape recorder?

1288
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,117
All right, one second. Then we can go.
So we're on speaker.

1289
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,192
- This is so insane.
- Now, wait. There's...

1290
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,952
I'm not nervous.

1291
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,197
The contractor came and
nobody's here. See if...

1292
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,194
- I'll get that. You go and call him.
- Yes, yes, all right.

1293
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,028
Hello?

1294
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:34,869
Hello, Paul. I can't talk much now.
If I sound strange, don't get alarmed.

1295
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,319
What’s the problem?

1296
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,549
They have your wife's body.
They showed it to me.

1297
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,391
Say that again.

1298
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,877
They have your wife's body.
They showed it to me.

1299
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,358
- Who has it? How many are there?
- Your neighbours. That’s right.

1300
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,717
They want $ 200, 000 for it.

1301
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,992
Are you calling from a speakerphone?
There's an echo.

1302
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,958
- Hold on.
- We don't have an answer for that.

1303
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:12,079
- Go to a different thought.
- What thought? Wait.

1304
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,312
You either pay them off,
or get rid of them.

1305
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:20,474
- We can't talk on the phone. Can we meet?
- Yes! They're keeping it refrigerated.

1306
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,872
- What? What did you say?
- About two hours ago.

1307
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,995
- Two... What? Two hours, what?
- Hold on.

1308
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,390
- I got this screwed up.
- Stupid.

1309
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,758
- Let’s get off quick. We've done it.
- All right. Do something.

1310
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,879
Okay.

1311
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:46,793
Hello, Paul. I can't talk much now.
If I sound strange, don't get alarmed.

1312
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,556
You're not making sense.
Pull yourself together.

1313
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:54,508
- Now, can we meet? The usual spot.
- Hold on.

1314
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,231
Helen? Helen, you still there? Helen?

1315
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,192
- Okay, hurry up.
- Forget it.

1316
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,716
- Somebody press something.
- Carol. You do it.

1317
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:12,150
You have no choice. Pay them off,
or get rid of them. I have to hang up.

1318
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,191
- What’s the matter? You look shaken.
- It’s nothing.

1319
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,909
- I worry about you these days, Paul.
- I'm fine.

1320
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,993
- You're different.
- I said I was fine. Stop interfering.

1321
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,192
- You never used to pull away.
- Leave me alone!

1322
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,158
I don't want to have
this conversation!

1323
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,312
My job is to wait one hour
and call Mr. House from a phone booth.

1324
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,040
- Why are you running?
- I have to change.

1325
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:04,876
- I've got an appointment about...
- What are you steamed up about?

1326
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,715
How could you give a book
to Marcia and not to me?

1327
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,476
What? We just had a big success.
Marcia likes to read what I like.

1328
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,916
We've got nothing in common,
that’s for sure.

1329
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,436
Now that Nick's grown,
we're left facing each other.

1330
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,431
You've got stuff in common with Ted.

1331
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,712
You can take your clothes off
and baste a chicken.

1332
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,668
What about Marcia?
What does she teach you besides poker?

1333
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,879
- Nothing, I'm her editor.
- It’s time to re-evaluate our lives.

1334
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,396
I re-evaluated our lives.
I got a ten, you got a six.

1335
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,678
- Maybe I'll go back to my shrink.
- You don't have to see a shrink.

1336
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,913
Nothing's wrong with you that can't
be cured with Prozac and a mallet.

1337
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:52,315
I would like to be alone a while, okay,
Larry? Just, l... Okay?

1338
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:58,917
I have a crazy father. He's wanted in three
states. He has a terrible driving record.

1339
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,835
- We had to move to New Jersey.
- Your father is wanted for driving?

1340
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,877
Yeah. I moved to Hackensack...

1341
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:10,875
I was in all these different contests.
And I was even Miss Teenage Passaic.

1342
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,439
How wonderful.

1343
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,995
God.

1344
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,273
Was that before or after
the fourth abortion?

1345
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:56,479
- After, but before the drama prize.
- Drama prize? I don't remember...

1346
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,553
Remember? "Out, out, damned spot"?
The topless Macbeth?

1347
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,188
- Yeah, for the fraternity party.
- Yeah.

1348
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,591
- Topless Macbeth, how could I forget?
- I was great.

1349
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,077
Hello, Mr. House?
This is Larry Lipton.

1350
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:25,358
I got a package
I think you're gonna want.

1351
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:31,629
Of course, it’s gonna cost you
$200,000 in small, unmarked bills.

1352
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,874
Or large, marked ones,
if you want to go that route.

1353
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:41,915
And I have a package. If you want
to see your wife alive, do as I say.

1354
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,998
Really?
Well, I think you're bluffing.

1355
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:50,109
Don't try and bluff a bluffer. If
you've got Carol, put her on the phone.

1356
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:56,110
Larry, help me! I'm here, Larry!

1357
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,999
Oh, my God. Don't hurt her!

1358
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,919
I'll tell you where to meet me.
Bring that package.

1359
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:08,358
Once I have it and I'm gone,
you get her back. Otherwise, I kill her.

1360
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:13,396
Yes. Yeah, no, I understand.
I'll be there. I'll be there.

1361
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,553
Yes, I'll bring your wife's body,
she... In the trunk of my car.

1362
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:21,508
Yes, I promise, I'll be there.

1363
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,749
I don't have his wife's body.

1364
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,832
Bluff, bluff.

1365
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,915
- Where's Carol?
- Show me Lillian's body.

1366
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,436
- I got it.
- No way she survived a molten steel vat.

1367
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,398
- No...
- lf you're not bluffing, where is she?

1368
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,870
- Why are you nervous?
- Where is she?

1369
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,554
- In the trunk of my car.
- Open it. Now.

1370
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,429
If she's not there,
I'll put a bullet through your head.

1371
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,068
Come on. Come on!

1372
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,996
- Step back.
- No, I got her.

1373
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,038
If I don't have her,
how come I got her ring?

1374
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,755
- I think you're lying!
- This is her ring. No.

1375
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,756
- What’s this?
- I can never bluff.

1376
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,434
- I've lost a fortune in cards.
- Listen.

1377
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,750
- I'm not a bluffer.
- Get off...

1378
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,795
Let go.

1379
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,469
That’s what Grisby thought.
She meant to kill Grisby.

1380
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,394
After he'd served his purpose.
He never even did that.

1381
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:45,439
He went and shot Broome.
And that was not part of the plan.

1382
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,913
Broome might have gone to the police.
And if the cops traced it to Grisby...

1383
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:54,755
... and the cops made Grisby talk,
he'd spill everything.

1384
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,988
And she'd be finished, so
she had to shut up Grisby, but quick.

1385
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,919
And I was the fall guy.

1386
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,229
Why don't you try to understand?

1387
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,996
- He was mad. He had to be shot.
- And what about me?

1388
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,151
We couldn't gone off together.

1389
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:45,713
- One who follows his nature, keeps...
- Help! Help!

1390
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,954
They can't see us behind the screen.
And they can't hear us with the sound on.

1391
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:56,359
- Not even a gunshot.
- Hello, Paul. Didn't you expect me?

1392
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,348
- Mrs. Dalton.
- You made promises to me over the years.

1393
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,798
And then you decided to dump me
for that young model.

1394
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,350
- I never led you on.
- It’s late for excuses.

1395
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:14,351
- None of you can prove anything.
- So you'd be foolish to fire that gun.

1396
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,674
With these mirrors, it’s difficult to tell,
but you are aiming at me, aren't you?

1397
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,590
I'm aiming at you, lover. Of course,
killing you is killing myself.

1398
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,993
- It’s the same thing.
- But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.

1399
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,915
- I'm so glad. Are you okay?
- Oh, God, Larry!

1400
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:56,752
I'm so happy to see you!

1401
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,151
- I was never so glad to see somebody.
- Get me out.

1402
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,594
Are you all right?

1403
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,629
You don't know what’s going on. I'll never
say life doesn't imitate art again.

1404
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,031
- We gotta call the police.
- Yes, and a glazier.

1405
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,589
- I know. Oh, God.
- Quick. Dial.

1406
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:18,949
Dial. I know. Larry.
Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Honey.

1407
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,831
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

1408
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,638
- Wife mine.
- Hello?

1409
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,994
Oh, God.

1410
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:31,278
God, it’s so complicated.
I can't keep track of it all.

1411
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,672
Listen.
I'll give it to you one more time.

1412
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,678
Mrs. House had a sister
who moved to England.

1413
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,469
She changed her name when she married.
Her husband died.

1414
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:47,269
She moved back to New York
a rich widow, but a recluse.

1415
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:50,637
Mr. And Mrs. House
knew they weren't in her will.

1416
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,236
They have her to dinner,
she accidentally keels over.

1417
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,269
She resembles her sister, so they
fake it, pretend Lillian House died.

1418
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:03,314
They cremate the sister.
Lillian checks into a fleabag joint...

1419
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,712
...pretends to be her sister: Closing
her accounts, liquidating her assets...

1420
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,350
...accumulating money.
She didn't realize her husband...

1421
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,115
...was two-timing her with Helen Moss,
this pretty model.

1422
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:20,798
He decides not to cut her in and go off
to, I don't know, with his mistress...

1423
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,080
...and keep all the dough.
So he kills Lillian.

1424
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:29,915
He cremates her, pours molten steel
over her or something...

1425
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,356
...and that’s when we came along
and tripped him up.

1426
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,876
- He had great alibis.
- That woman who worked for him?

1427
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:42,068
She covered for him. She loved him.
Not that she dreamed he was a murderer.

1428
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,073
I want to celebrate.
What do you want to do?

1429
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,913
Want to see what
Larry and Carol are up to?

1430
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,594
I think they want to be alone.

1431
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:56,073
Yeah. Okay. All right.
Well, you have any plans?

1432
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:00,313
- You're taking me to dinner, right?
- Right. We can't sleep together.

1433
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,549
- Why?
- Not tonight.

1434
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:05,838
I slept with Helen Moss today.
I'm not young like I used to be.

1435
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,310
You'll do anything to catch a murderer,
won't you?

1436
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,754
- What an experience.
- I know.

1437
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,797
- I'm still vibrating.
- I know.

1438
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,520
You know,
you were surprisingly brave.

1439
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,240
Really? Surprisingly?
You seem shocked.

1440
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,953
- You know, I'm a pretty good guy.
- I know.

1441
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:29,148
Where do you want to go for dinner?
Let’s not eat anywhere they serve cowards.

1442
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,836
- What are you laughing at?
- You know, I love you.

1443
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,549
How could you be jealous of Marcia?
Isn't that ridiculous?

1444
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,678
- Don't you know I love you?
- You were jealous of Ted.

1445
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,196
Ted? You're kidding.
Take away his elevator shoes...

1446
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,079
...fake suntan and capped teeth,
what do you have?

1447
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:51,075
- You.
- Right. I like that. That’s a good one.
