1
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:00,910
And, over here - perhaps
the most cherished ancient artifact

2
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:02,520
in the Western world.

3
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,991
The shroud of Turin.

4
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,328
Inspector Dreyfus is here to see you.

5
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:41,686
Chief-Inspector.
Sir!

6
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,807
I´m sure you know why you're here.
The British, the Italians and the

7
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:49,287
Japanese have
are assembling an elite squad of their finest detectives.

8
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:53,067
An international dream team
to track down

9
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:54,959
this 'Tornado'

10
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:58,164
And France will be represented?
Exactly!

11
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,725
I an honored but
not surprised.

12
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,007
This is the culmination of my career.

13
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:08,399
The moment that I´ve been waiting for
all my life.

14
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,096
No, no, no!
Maybe not all my life, but....

15
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:16,436
They want Clouseau since he is considered
the top detective in the world.

16
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:20,240
We have been asked if Clouseau is
available to lead the Dream Team.

17
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:22,548
Clouseau?
Yes.

18
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:30,174
Is there something wrong?
No, no. Not at all.

19
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,879
Would you mind if I use your bathroom?
Certainly.

20
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:42,608
Clouseau!

21
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:01,726
I'm afraid Sir - that Clouseau is
currently occupied.

22
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:04,956
What?
And I have assigned him to a mission so important

23
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:07,544
for our country, so I fear
for our national security - if he was taken off it!

24
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:31,607
What is this for?

25
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,132
Why?
41 cm from the kerb.

26
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:43,180
9 cm too far!

27
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,398
Stop, Stop, now.

28
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,336
You must take the ticket!

29
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,299
You have to take punishment.

30
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,019
Excuse me.

31
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:40,998
Thank you.

32
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,861
Are you done?
Completely operational.

33
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:49,527
Inspector, your new system will monitor and record
every word and every movement in this room.

34
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:53,999
So if anyone breaks in - what happens?
Your office is linked to the elite 'blackberries'.

35
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,522
They will be here in seconds.

36
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,870
Sir, Inspector Clouseau is here to see you.

37
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,789
Send him in.
I have to appoint him to the Dream Team.

38
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,518
Clouseau?
Do not ask nothing.

39
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:10,796
Good afternoon, chief inspector,
I am here with my report.

40
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:16,299
This medal of honour
you are so fortunate that you never got one.

41
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:21,123
You look so tidy - not having
honours or other forms of distinguishing decor.

42
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,581
Why don´t you wear it under your shirt - you know?
Out of sight!
Brilliant idea, boss.

43
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:31,549
I now write fines for parking,
as you have ordered.

44
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:35,736
The last 6 weeks,
I wrote them a lot.

45
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,751
One in front of you and the museum,
and one in violation of the bent licencenplate law.

46
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:44,133
Yes, I recall.

47
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:48,289
Fascinating - I shall waste no time in reading it!

48
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:55,107
And just in case, I have made
cross-refences in my little black book.

49
00:08:55,691 --> 00:09:03,644
Now - Clouseau - do you remember
when I first put you on that parking ticket-detail?
Yes - you explained it as a top-level assignment.

50
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:11,689
And if anyone asked you - if I was the one who had assigned you
to this incredibly poor mission
You would deny it?

51
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:17,072
Oh Chief-Inspector, I don´t even know what you are talking about.

52
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:26,430
Good work - Clouseau, now
to - to business!
I have been instructed to re-assign you to a....

53
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,013
Clouseau?

54
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:49,201
Watch it!

55
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,918
What is the code?
I do not know.

56
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,754
Hamburger.
Thank you, sir, have a nice day.

57
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:16,903
The password was Hamburger
No - ambarger.
I said Hamburger - no - you said ambugarall

58
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:24,527
How did you know we were being recorded?
Ah - easy Inspector!

59
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:28,389
This pencil reveals micro waves.

60
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,243
Radio Shack - 12 dollars.

61
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:35,997
How do you know password?
This led chip decodes passwords.

62
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,011
and wear it behind your medal of honor.

63
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,276
Radio Shack?

64
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,493
What do you think this is?
A Tape recorder.

65
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,017
No, it only looks like a Tape Recorder.

66
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,773
It is actually a pen.

67
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,886
So you can write with it
and no one will know?

68
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,374
Bingo!

69
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:08,243
Now, you were saying Inspector?
You are being re-assigned...

70
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:11,668
Let me read your mind 
the Tornado is at large and you want me to protect the 
Pink Panther

71
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,801
No - It is my job is to protect the Pink Panther.
You are merely being re-assigned to the Dream Team.

72
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:22,885
Oh - that is quite an honour, but I can not accept.

73
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:28,465
If inspector Clouseau were to leave France,
the Tornado would surely strike at the Pink Panther.

74
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:33,203
I´m guarding it it!
Don´t argue with me!

75
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:37,905
But I can´t fly!
In an Airplane!

76
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:39,496
But, still
That´s an order!

77
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:59,308
Oh - you are travelling? Inspector Dreyfus
is sending me on a very dangerous mission.

78
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:01,520
How long?
When will you return?

79
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,584
I will return when the criminal is caught.
It could be a month or a year, you understand Nicole.

80
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,383
Yes, yes of course.

81
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:15,474
We have to stay apart, if the criminal
would kidnap you, they would have power over me.

82
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:19,047
Why would he have power over you?

83
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:25,798
This is because

84
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,776
You are like a brother to me.

85
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:33,831
A hot sexy brother in a dress.

86
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:39,732
Nicole - I hope you have forgiven me
for that one evening
Yes - inspector - I have forgotten.

87
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,416
Inspector, but I have not forgotten.

88
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,419
I'm not forgetting.

89
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:58,796
Technically we are on duty,
do you think it would be allright to share a bottle ofwine?

90
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:04,293
I think it would be allright.
Great, I´ll select the wine - it is one of my specialties.

91
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:11,430
Hey - I would like to select my own wine.

92
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:15,003
And by the way
I am Inspector Jacque Clouseau.

93
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,203
Remember this face.

94
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:18,089
Good bottle?
Excellent.

95
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:35,088
But - burning down a restaurant
It ignited us our more illicit fires.

96
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:43,392
And - I'm sorry about that.
So am I. Don´t be remorseful.

97
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:46,398

It was a night to remember
That we must forget!

98
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,590
We must never forget and not remember it.


99
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,178
And if we do remember it
we must immediately forget it.

100
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,983
Now - let´s have a professional hug Good-Bye.

101
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,916
I´ll be right there. Will see you in seven minutes..

102
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:11,807
No problem.
And I do hope your hearing improves!

103
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,547
Ponton, I am worried about my leaving France.

104
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:24,647
The Tornado is rampant, the Pink
Panther is such a temptation.

105
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:30,821
But you visited the Museum yourself
you checked the security.

106
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:34,199
Everything will be OK.
Yes - presume you are right.

107
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,814
Are you driving?
I like to stay in practice!

108
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,224
Remember where the brakes are?
Here.

109
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,613
And then - this turns.

110
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:55,979
Let's go.

111
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:03,428
Ponton! This case is very strange.

112
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:07,984
How so Inspector? For 10 years
the Tornado terrorised Europe.

113
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:11,000
Stealing over a quarter of a billion dollars
worth of artifacts.

114
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,891
Then, for no reason
he suddenly stops.

115
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:21,722
Maybe he had enough money.
Why - after 10 years of inactivity?

116
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:27,331
He suddenly springs into action
London, Italy

117
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:34,327
Right now.All of the sudden!
Why? Why?

118
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,464
You seem a little depressed today?
Is it your wife again?

119
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:12,995
Yes. She still feels my job takes up to
much of my time.

120
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,524
Yes - the same old thing


121
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,850
Next week is our tenth anniversary
She thinks we should go away together...

122
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,325
Would you like me to talk to her?
Oh, no.

123
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:34,240
This thing must be discussed between husband and wife
Well - you must explain to her that we are men of the law
allways realing in the shadow

124
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,882
Idiot.

125
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:45,446
I will miss you Inspector.
I will miss you too - Ponton.

126
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:51,758
Ponton! Yes? I am sorry that
you can´t satisfy your wife!

127
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:07,630
The legendary  Pink Panther diamond
has been stolen.

128
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,835
What did I tell you?

129
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:20,779
Damn!

130
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:26,037
The Dream Team was supposed to start its investigation
in Kyoto, Japan - but has diverted to Paris

131
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:49,716
This is a national tradegy.
We live in the media age. You must learn to adapt.

132
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:06,450
Inspector, you have any comment?

133
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:11,168
Tornado, I´m coming to get you!
One more.

134
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,659
Tornado, I´m coming to get you!

135
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:22,642
Good Afternoon, inspector.

136
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:26,051
The other detectives arrived
and they´re waiting for you.

137
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,807
Oh - I´m sorry - I do not I remember your name.

138
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,989
What? Oh, yes
I am Nicole.

139
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:40,076
Yes - how nice to see you again.

140
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,900
You too Inspector!

141
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,956
Where are the other detectives?

142
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,766
Well yes - they are waiting inside.

143
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:53,761
I hope noone has tampered with the crime scene

144
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:56,840
The crime scen is like a curve - it will inevitably
 lead to the criminal

145
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:00,835
Thats´s why it must allways be kept in pristine condition

146
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:14,168
Good day.
I´m Inspector Jaques Clouseau of the French Police.

147
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:20,175
I am Vicenzo Roccaras
Skvardjalupi Branca Leone. And your name?

148
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:25,015
Vicenzo Roccaras
Skvardjalupi Branca Leone.

149
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:28,210
Oh - and that is your name.
I thought that you were ordering something in Italian.

150
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:31,054
Once again.

151
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:35,477
Vicenzo Roccara
Skvardjalupi Branca Leone.

152
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,715
Kendji Masuto.

153
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:49,815
My associates, Gilbert Ponton and this is Nicole.

154
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:54,538
Nicole is here to serve us your needs
so feel free to use her in any way you wish.

155
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,199
And now - there is a crime scene waiting.

156
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,860
Oh - excuse me "el cino di craimo"

157
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:10,319
That is not Italian,
and I do speak English.

158
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,880
Oh Really? Prove it!

159
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,753
Gentlemen, we first have to determin
how the crime was committed

160
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:21,583
Since I am an expert at deduction.

161
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:25,230
That is my field.
I believe that this my field.

162
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,899
As you are experiencing hip-hen ?
How do you know?

163
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,868
One side of the sole of your shoes
is worn more than the other - you are favoring your right leg!

164
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:37,849
Tell me
Did you enjoy your double expresso this morning?

165
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,456
Your pupils are noticably dilated.

166
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:43,060
And will you be moving out of Hotel Montmartre?

167
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:47,889
They are doing construction at night
so as to not disturb daytime trafic

168
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,516
From your puffy eyes I deduce you
spent a sleepless night.

169
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:55,859
Speaking about traffic,
Are you enjoying your "Smart" car?

170
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:02,063
Your trousers are wrinkled behind your knees.
And how do you think your favourite football team Arsenal will do this year?

171
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:06,730
That match-box is from the only bar in Paris
that shows English football telecast.

172
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:09,470
You have tissues in your shoes to make you look taller.

173
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:10,771
And you were 14 before you finally learnt to enjoy avocado

174
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:14,915
Tell me - how did you enjoy the trip
to the airport, this morning?

175
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:17,827
Who knows that?

176
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,952
Perhaps one of you should begin?
Yes, this is silly.

177
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,570
Il Tornado is not careful
as he thinks.

178
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:37,259
Fingerprint.

179
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,901
With this small piece of glass
the case is practically solved.

180
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:47,858
This one has a fingerprint.

181
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:48,859
This one has a fingerprint too!

182
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,158
You do not need that.
You have plenty of fingerprint evidence.

183
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,489
What do we know about this tornado?

184
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:07,890
We know that its a white male
between 50 to 65 years.

185
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,796
With a scar from a bullet-hole
behind his right shoulder.

186
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:15,771
1996 Tornado was shot right here in France.
Whilst trying to steal a golden vase.

187
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:22,100
Blood was found, his DNA has been on file
for over ten years - without a match.

188
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:31,616
I´m sorry I´m late - my flight was a bit delayed
You´re Jacques Clouseau!

189
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:38,561
The Pink Panther detective.
This is such a thrill.

190
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:44,807
Who is it that are you? I am sorry Asselandrous. 
Didn´t anyone tell you....  Yes.

191
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:48,973
Yes - I was informed.
A last minute addition to our team.

192
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:54,694
I have written a book on all Tornado crimes,
but I´m not sure if I´m going to be of any help here.

193
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:58,541
Technically  speaking, I am not really a detective.
Welcome.

194
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,902
Now - let me bring you up to speed.
we know nothing. You are now up to speed.

195
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:20,680
The Dream Team gathered for the first time in front of the Grand Palais
 to start their investigations into the tornado thefts

196
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:26,696
Inspector Clouseau had this to say.
Tornado -I´m coming to get you.

197
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:36,239
I was able to discover that this Tornado
hacked the security system from a remote location

198
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,237
and turned off all alarms and the cameras
Can you trace the source? Yes - but it will take time

199
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:46,836
You are new here? Yes, I
I am Mrs Berenger.

200
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:51,266
I know who you are, inspector.
Do you - do you!
Due to the media frenzy surrounding this case

201
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:56,867
I have been assigned to instruct employees
on political and social correctness.

202
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:02,286
It is allways nice to have a very sexy woman clamping around
the building in high heels

203
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:12,140
You may not never refer to a woman as sexy.
But that was complementing you.

204
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:16,116
No - Inspector.
You must not comment on a womans´ body!

205
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,252
Oh - I get it. I get it.

206
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:24,346
I keep it to myself, when I´m thinking
WOFF!

207
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,333
Oh, inspector...

208
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:32,272
This will be an exercise and I want you to concentrate
and no matter what I say

209
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,864
you want your expression to
remain neutral.

210
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:36,618
That will be easy.

211
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:42,287
You´re here in the corridor at your employment and you see
a very pretty young woman walking toward you

212
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:46,324
- and her blouse is tight and is rather bursting at the buttons - 
drops her pencil

213
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:50,424
and as she bends to retrieve it - her blouse parts
revealing her cleavage of her

214
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,881
soft round white mounds 

215
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,766
And then the pencil rolls around- and she bends again

216
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:00,932
and her undulating buttocks
cause her short skirt to rise just shy of

217
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:06,096
panties

218
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:10,236
I like you Mrs Beringer

219
00:26:11,143 --> 00:26:12,646
I like you a lot.

220
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:18,226
So I have made lunch reservations at four different 
restaurants depending on who wants to eat where

221
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:24,250
Well - you know - I can not decide,
What is more beautiful.

222
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,382
Paris, or you?

223
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:37,016
These words, you make associates,
I believe that indiskretne.

224
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:39,256
Really?
To

225
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,530
This Attention to posvecujes Nicole

226
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:49,231
Oh, I understand. You two love to
No!

227
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:53,615
We two are not such.
Characters do not stop your finger?

228
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:57,291
Our two gajimo not feelings
one another.

229
00:26:57,292 --> 00:27:00,418
Excellent, because find
that is very drazesna.

230
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:03,287
Drazesna to!

231
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:11,531
However, it is evil.
I creep. Creep?

232
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,409
It's creep.

233
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:18,264
I think mistaken.
You and I are men of words.

234
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,788
We have all the sexy, glamurous women.

235
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:26,122
Yes, but I believe that should have
to ensure that the win.

236
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:34,108
Miss Olandris.
Oh

237
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,495
You're a hunter, and Nicole is a woman for
whole life, that it imas children.

238
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,758
Children? Yes, many, many children.

239
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,248
Uh, such zude for children.

240
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,694
Zude for children.

241
00:27:54,043 --> 00:28:02,672
Pontoon, if I said that I have
endless desire for the family?

242
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:05,485
Decided to have lunch?

243
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,612
I believe that thou eat
dry, my little yellow friend.

244
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:12,303
what?

245
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:18,537
Inspectors, Japanese men are not
call, our little yellow friends.

246
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:22,053
Why?
Because it is a stereotype.

247
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,724
Do you have something against Asian?
Of course not.

248
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:31,646
Send their fathers
and that as they look around.

249
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:44,171
So you may not talk about the blonde.
But, it's so.

250
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:53,078
Odmeravali you?
No. Yes.

251
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:57,359

I did not.

252
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,241
Again you are. I did not.
Yes, I saw. I did not.

253
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:04,359
Eat.

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,906
Again you are. I did not.
Yes. Oh, see.

255
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,096
Oh, my Boz.

256
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:29,725
Hulk!
Doubt about his wife.

257
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,404
I told it to me

258
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,262

second place, after his career.

259
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:40,678
Great. Congratulations.
Now you are a real man.

260
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:45,922
Can I with you to stay?
What? Out me.

261
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,524
Yes, I suppose.
Thank you.

262
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:56,568
It's okay, guys.

263
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:04,966
What is this? Hulk?
My children

264
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:09,529
Lui and Antoine. This is
Zak. He was named after you.

265
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:18,939
Ujace Zak, what is it?

266
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,625
This is the present president of France.

267
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:26,960
Take it.

268
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:37,828
The l 'to Pink panther?
No, it is a replica, a copy.

269
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:44,240
I won this competition
Karate, in the school.

270
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:47,282
So sweet.

271
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,816
To show you the real trophy.

272
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,446
With the recent karate competitions.

273
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:02,300
Wow! Love karate.
Love!

274
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:10,625
The success of karate moves
lies in the surprise.

275
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:20,943
Good you are.
Thank you.

276
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:28,995
In order to capture the tornado,
have

277
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:32,492
understand his motives. I believe that
thief now trying to sell goods.

278
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:37,209
Ok. Hey, fellow,
Turija a dress?

279
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,708
Too is known to have been sold.

280
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:48,796
I have something.

281
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:56,356
Says that half the contents
Museum located in Rome.

282
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:04,142
Rome? There is something wrong?
No, Rome does not mean nothing to me.

283
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:07,489
Signs me.

284
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:19,048
Rome perfect.
Trade in the black.

285
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:23,333
We have to find Tornadovo habitat.

286
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,604
Always postiji suspected tornado is not

287
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:45,323
a much older, but I think
that we have the right year.

288
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:50,146
We have a sample of his DNA.
48, maybe it's an hour older.

289
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:55,580
Where is the pilot?
I do not believe anyone, only himself.

290
00:32:56,614 --> 00:33:02,016
Yes, your aircraft.
Nikoleta, if you would be my kopilot?

291
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,299
Come?
OK.

292
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:23,919
I hope that will not interfere.
Ometajte me.

293
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:34,622
I think about what you
said for the Museum, for the missing profile.

294
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:46,170
Perhaps the romantic
frustration led to it.

295
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:52,194
That did not happen.
Of course.

296
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:59,888
He now has to start
a new romance with someone better.

297
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:11,881
Entertaining you. New Romance.
Understand what say.

298
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:15,536
which is very fun.

299
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:23,810
Kluz inspector seems to think that
Miss Olandres is fun.

300
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,995
Rec which would be described.

301
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:38,236
He said that you are disgusting.
Creep?

302
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,101
Hulk, tell me more about
inspector Kluzou.

303
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:03,066
He brilijantan Man, Orthodox

304
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:07,336
We have full confidence that the
on that will solve the case.

305
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,398
You are crazy.

306
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:18,439
If Kluz resolve this case,
trcacu around in diapers.

307
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:27,520
what you know more about Tornado?
He is a

308
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:31,381
collector. But, because of illegal
action dropped from the Spain.

309
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:39,282
Well, now must rambling woods, as
animals. With the abomination that is criminal.

310
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:44,078
There is one thing in this world,
crime is not always detected.

311
00:35:54,985 --> 00:36:01,051
We need to smislmo way
how to prisunjamo.

312
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:11,827
I am expecting you.

313
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:17,295
You have these dreams?
And, who to ask?

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Make yourself at your home.

321
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,443
How can I help you? Lord
Avellaneda, where you were last Friday?

322
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,295
For dinner with daughter
and former wife.

323
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:27,136
If you do not believe, call them.
I am. They say you are not a long view.

324
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:31,679
Can I see your computer?

325
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:36,848
I do not have what to hide. Sometimes,
things are hidden in most places.

326
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:46,653
My system security.

327
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:57,805
Attention, sir.
Answer the questions.

328
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,773
In connection with the tornado.

329
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:10,320
I have never been a video his face.
Whence this, if you are not?

330
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:13,928
He was a disguise.
Always wearing a mask.

331
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:21,625
Did you call him zoro,
or powerful rendzer?

332
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:25,743
You cooperate, and never
never seen his face? Once.

333
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,429
It seems like it is, thus,
or this?

334
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:32,995
No, I said that I did not tornado.

335
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:38,021
How do you pay?
Deposit account with Bank of Switzerland.

336
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,927
Issues that can not be followed.

337
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:48,826
I know you do not have the answers
that you meet.

338
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:55,618
Do you now mean to me that you will
suspect the whole life?

339
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:59,956
Excuse me? Oh, that? There is something
which proves your innocence.

340
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,322
Far in 1996, when the
Yes, that

341
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:09,426
Boy was wounded in the pucanjavi.
Behold, how long it was.

342
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:15,880
Will we remove
clothing and disorders

343
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,328
sanctity of my home, while group
people do not prove that I am innocent.

344
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:23,650
Would not be bad.

345
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,504
Nice. Go to the point.

346
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,667
I remember how much,
It was the right shoulder.

347
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:53,811
I believe that this is a proof,
that I did not Tornado.

348
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:57,810
Leave you alone.

349
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:25,721
It has already been stripped shirt.
No wounds.

350
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:30,027
Are?

351
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:38,705
No physical evidence.
Or hole from the bullet.

352
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:41,776
Yes you heard of
cosmetic surgery?

353
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:46,688
Oh, of course

354
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:58,107
I checked all the computers.
Neither one does not have access to the museum.

355
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:05,394
Kluz, do not see what is happening
about you? This madness must stop.

356
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:10,587
What if you say that I feel
Tornado presence in the house.

357
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,789
I do not know anything.

358
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:26,511
Know and early.

359
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,482
One day will find me.
Do not Tell so.

360
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:36,258
This is strange, I feel it.

361
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:38,960
Really?

362
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:44,689
What?
Is not it obvious?

363
00:41:51,714 --> 00:41:57,773
Would you like to znas Spanish restaurant
called plate nothing?

364
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:00,346
I knew it.
I destroyed it.

365
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:04,144
This I found.

366
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:08,045
It says nothing.
Can be found anywhere.

367
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:13,057
I asked why would cuva
memory for Secanje for dinner?

368
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:15,154
Very well done, pontoon.

369
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:23,992
What do we do now? Research, pontoon,
to see if it was perhaps tornado.

370
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:30,596
We'll take a taxi and a little scout.

371
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:45,546
Stuck the pontoon. Fortunately,

372
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:51,628
povratice the next plate.
Kaz Nabal reicum man piano.

373
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:57,718
Kaz, my work is not the same
elsewhere in Italy. What is it?

374
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:02,758
Before opening, I learned
that table is reserved.

375
00:43:03,387 --> 00:43:06,401
I set the eavesdropper.
How did you know?

376
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:11,481
You felt the fingers.

377
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,091
E, this is the surprise.

378
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,741
what it works here,
with him?

379
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:27,900
I'm sorry, inspectors.
We need to discover where sitting.

380
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,133
Why?
To set Bubice.

381
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,827
But, how?
Play me.

382
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:44,057
Hello, you remember me?

383
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:21,086
Dislike is a restaurant?
I was here before, is beautiful.

384
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,508
Behold, zasluzio you.

385
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:41,273
I certify that the
Pope's ring stolen.

386
00:47:41,896 --> 00:47:45,630
Ironically, but these dreams
was 5 miles away, in Rome.

387
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:49,911
People tearing because the Tornado
managed to steal this.

388
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:51,809
Before the nose.

389
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:06,452
what is going to take these dreams?
We have no comment.

390
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:10,541
If you find ring.
If I gave

391
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:13,806
suggestion, and I said to
necu, I've like a fool.

392
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,953
Do not worry, the service I have.

393
00:48:54,702 --> 00:48:56,771
Ring of St. Peter
will be returned to the church.

394
00:48:57,747 --> 00:48:58,590
Sit, please.

395
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:06,143
Papo sir, that you have
aware of their rank?

396
00:49:08,598 --> 00:49:10,974
My hat?
Yes, that great.

397
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:19,568
Then maybe sit on it.

398
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:27,208
Can be naduva.

399
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:31,335
Beautiful as new.

400
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:39,596
Excuse me. Did you
connection with the collector?

401
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:44,669
I am the Pope.
Excuse me sir Papo.

402
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,286
But, sometimes when you speak
loud, people break now.

403
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:53,466
How is ring?
The ring was

404
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:56,308
value.
Then there is no purpose to steal.

405
00:49:57,002 --> 00:50:01,933
Perhaps you wanted to sell it
for large houses.

406
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,078
But I have.

407
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:13,411
To reconstruct.
When you arrived? At 9 o'clock.

408
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:18,597
What do you do?
Went out to the balcony to divim world.

409
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:22,928
It was so nice that I am
is felt BLIZIM God.

410
00:50:23,432 --> 00:50:27,876
You are very spiritual man,
is not it?

411
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:33,889
My job is to read people.
I think I'm good at it.

412
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:39,786
What do you do then? Stripped
clothes, and put in the cabinet.

413
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:41,686
Can I?
Definitely.

414
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:48,905
When the beautiful manage, you do not have

415
00:50:48,907 --> 00:50:52,065
the morning to gaze when preparing
for work. I also do.

416
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:57,236
To the author reviews the crime,
put in your position.

417
00:50:58,228 --> 00:50:59,783
With your permission.
Definitely.

418
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:22,517
Nice night.
Pogledacu month.

419
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:25,866
I'm on the balcony.

420
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,759
I went out to the balcony and live.

421
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:36,004
I feel very spiritual.

422
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:44,092
See month.

423
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,933
I feel very spiritual.

424
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:49,562
Then enter.

425
00:51:51,514 --> 00:51:55,331
What do you do then?
Went out for the second time.

426
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,443
Again I see the moon.

427
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:06,129
I looked in the month.
It is 15 seconds.

428
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:12,799
15 seconds is enough
time to enter a robber.

429
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:17,152
Therefore, it is important to repeat the event.

430
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:24,830
And, maybe he just then peo

431
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,934
boss, Zilber wants to talking to you.

432
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,498
Will Kluzoa to take the case.

433
00:52:57,194 --> 00:53:00,222
No, this is something great
this time.

434
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:28,058
Ah, home.

435
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:33,548
Iznanadjenje.

436
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,116
I'm impressed.
The advantages we have.

437
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:14,011
Now will you teach
master of karate.

438
00:55:13,946 --> 00:55:17,813
All is forgiven.

439
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,204
How do you feel the shift?
Inspector Kluz is professional.

440
00:55:31,723 --> 00:55:33,645
Accustomed to the pressure.

441
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:46,028
All newspapers in the world pisu
that we are idiots.

442
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:52,694
We have to restore the reputation.
Difficult, when you hate us so much.

443
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,609
One has, I believe that
will again. If he solve this case

444
00:56:00,128 --> 00:56:02,970
24 hours necu nothing except wear diapers.

445
00:56:03,642 --> 00:56:05,618
I wear a large pink bag.

446
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:08,999
I suggest to solve it.
Who is?

447
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:15,164
whatever that is

448
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:21,797
Kluz, why you fell from
balcony, dressed as the Pope?

449
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:26,910
I am kept evidence.
What?

450
00:56:29,064 --> 00:56:32,168
Key?
We gave it the pope's rooms on the floor.

451
00:56:32,874 --> 00:56:35,095
Something that you prevideo.
It may mean something to.

452
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:39,338
But, if the key is important,
the browser.

453
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:48,824
Kluz, you need to report not
so nice news, that you have excluded from the team.

454
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:54,557
Nothing more a part of the investigation.

455
00:56:57,493 --> 00:56:59,787
Arivederci

456
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:01,845
Sajonara.

457
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:25,251
What are you doing in Nikolininoj office?

458
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:29,162
I was released.
And you thought it to share.

459
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:32,842
Yes, well we match.

460
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,169
Story of my life.

461
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:40,877
The man who interested me,
is not interested in me.

462
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,567
Really? I thought that
all interested in you.

463
00:57:46,164 --> 00:57:51,550
Why to say?
For

464
00:57:58,133 --> 00:57:59,827
You are very attractive.

465
00:58:00,587 --> 00:58:03,461
With me in the office for 5 minutes.

466
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:17,472
Really no one?
Sincerely, The love of my life failed.

467
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:20,076
Jadnici.

468
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:28,148
Nicole.
No, sorry, I

469
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,658
You have a message from Vicenza.

470
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:37,180
Let me tell, if he needs my expertise.

471
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:40,097
Resolve the case.

472
00:59:48,474 --> 00:59:53,201
Life has become uninteresting,
a lot more stolen treasure.

473
00:59:53,778 --> 00:59:56,927
No theft, life is
become uninteresting

474
00:59:56,928 --> 01:00:00,078
and without purpose, do not
more desire to live.

475
01:00:00,928 --> 01:00:05,253
Returned all, except
Pink Pantera. Want to

476
01:00:05,255 --> 01:00:09,578
uzivam a few days
in its beauty.

477
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:12,344
No one will have it, except me,
so I destroyed it.

478
01:00:13,065 --> 01:00:15,828
Pink panther is dust.
This is the final payoff.

479
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:07,402
Pontoon, we have two
free man, alone in Paris.

480
01:03:08,048 --> 01:03:09,955
In one of najubudljivijih
cities in the world.

481
01:03:11,153 --> 01:03:12,803
In order to be able to
time longer?

482
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:19,633
How is this called?
Hohoba. Hohoba.

483
01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:23,625
To see.

484
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,689
By jojoba.
Read the hohoba.

485
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:34,368
By jojoba,
but read hohoba.

486
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,380
Hohoba.
Why would a radio?

487
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:41,302
Hohoba.

488
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:45,572
Hohoba.
Hohoba.

489
01:03:46,168 --> 01:03:48,665
Hohoba.
Hohoba.

490
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:51,765
Hohoba.
Hohoba.

491
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:53,770
Hohoba.
Hohoba.

492
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,756
Hohoba.
Hohoba.

493
01:04:11,368 --> 01:04:13,555
How to spend nice.
Who should be more women!

494
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:18,136
Hocu house with women and children.
What would you?

495
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:24,712
I'd like to say that love and family
may not be in second place.

496
01:04:25,638 --> 01:04:28,998
Inspectors, our
standpoint are different.

497
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:32,813
I am happy that I live
with shampoo.

498
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:36,871
You are the best inspector, but when the

499
01:04:36,872 --> 01:04:40,534
love in question, not
see what you say.

500
01:04:41,984 --> 01:04:45,874
For example, color.
Did you know that her eye color?

501
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:49,264
Name friend.
