1
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:05,204
Man: This is a recipe
for poetry.

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:07,240
Begin with a healthy portion
of heartache,

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,307
thick and juicy.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,276
Add a pinch of debt,
dash of despair,

5
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:11,577
a lot of rocks.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,479
...shout across time
at the injustice and confusion

7
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,515
of a life made far more
than just bearable by you.

8
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,050
I hadn't realized
that you made it

9
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,584
all the way
into my genes,

10
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,585
love as stable
as a grease fire,

11
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,753
hope as twisted
as a strand of DNA.

12
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:22,755
Woman: Only half the time
I'm coming.

13
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:24,490
The other half,
I'm faking.

14
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:25,958
Half growing,
half shrinking,

15
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,427
half above water,
half sinking.

16
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,495
Half midnight,
half shooting star blazing,

17
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:31,730
and half of what y'all think
of me deeply affects me.

18
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:32,999
The other half
doesn't faze me.

19
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,367
3rd man: Where are
my silver dollars
gonna come from,

20
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,568
and when will I take shelter
from a thunderstorm again

21
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,404
in a milking shed,
ankle-deep in cow shit

22
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,274
with that dust bowl
freckled soldier,

23
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,876
that moonshine newlywed
and hard times husband...

24
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,478
2nd woman:
Jam up miniskirts,

25
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,147
arm, hands
hang out short sleeves.

26
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,282
Food never
disappoints you,

27
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,817
never breaks your heart,

28
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,186
food doesn't show up late,
doesn't complain about sex.

29
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,287
Eat!

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,922
That's what
agri-business wants.

31
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,223
Gobble, munch,
chomp, and swallow.

32
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,193
3rd woman: Somebody
trying to make love
to somebody.

33
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,195
Someone trying
to make somebody,

34
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,530
someone love me enough.

35
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:06,265
Can't trust this
anymore,

36
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:09,569
pretend
to ignore anymore.

37
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,840
I was only 11 years old
at my brother Jason's funeral.

38
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,710
We stood in the falling rain
off the 405 freeway.

39
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,645
An open grave stared at me.

40
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:23,381
They covered the leftover
pile of dirt with astroturf.

41
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:25,318
My mother was horrified

42
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,420
at the people attending
the funeral.

43
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,056
I thought
they were funny.

44
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,224
It was Noah's ark
for decadence,

45
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,925
the odd and the occult.

46
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,194
My parents
were in a hurry to leave.

47
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,330
They'd seen enough.

48
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,866
I never got to say goodbye.

49
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,735
He was sick for two years
before he died.

50
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,404
He wrote me
stories and poems.

51
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:47,206
They were great.

52
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,242
This is for him.
It's called, uh...

53
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,811
It's called<i> burning a rat.</i>

54
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:53,545
Ahem.

55
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,514
Man: Get on with it!

56
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,450
I find him
lying by the door,

57
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,553
legs outstretched
as if he died in mid-leap.

58
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:02,221
I pick him up by the tail.
He's loose,

59
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,257
beyond the first stiffness
of death.

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,293
Party's over.
Time to head home.

61
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,829
Suddenly,
I want to burn him.

62
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,232
Surprised
by my own desire

63
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:14,466
to save him from slow decay,

64
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,435
fetid rearrangements
of his parts,

65
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:17,602
or so I tell myself.

66
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:21,307
But, mostly,
I just want to see him burn.

67
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,476
Drop him on a wire screen

68
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,945
that covers
the 40-gallon drum,

69
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,047
reflections of fire
in my eyes,

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,383
as I am strangely satisfied.

71
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,885
Whiskers furl
into quick question marks

72
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:33,920
and are gone.

73
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,322
Wilted fur,
black and dry,

74
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,423
long nightmare tail...

75
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,423
No!

76
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,493
Holds on longer
than I thought.

77
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,995
As hours pass,
it is the only thing left,

78
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:44,363
white length of ash

79
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,631
like the backbone
of something prehistoric,

80
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,302
seen from a great distance.

81
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,346
Great crowd tonight, Gabe.

82
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,981
It's your job
to make them listen.

83
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:06,118
Jake. Jake, my man,
that was heavy.

84
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,889
This next guy coming up
is our last poet.

85
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,725
Put your hands together
for teezer!

86
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:16,062
[Applause and cheering]

87
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,064
Thank you, Gabriel.

88
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,532
<i> My first condom.</i>

89
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:24,370
I am shopping for a condom
I may soil for my love.

90
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:28,040
I am shopping for a condom
I may lubricate thereof.

91
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:32,178
Stand did she
in sweet chastity

92
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,046
until I broke that lock.

93
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,881
It seemed so drastic,

94
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:37,315
a piece of plastic

95
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,286
wrapped round my cock.

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,090
But procreation and masturbation
do not walk hand in hand.

97
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,261
And little babies
or a case of rabies

98
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,097
is not what I had planned.

99
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,266
So wrap do I...

100
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,266
Unbelievable.

101
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:58,504
My third eye with
red-ribbed prophylactic.

102
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:02,041
And you must
with plastic trust

103
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:06,312
if you wish
to be sexually active.

104
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:09,082
[Cheering]

105
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay. All right.

106
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:20,625
Now is the time for you
to exercise your supreme right

107
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,728
to vote for the best poet
in the house.

108
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:26,432
My able-bodied assistant
will pass among thee and thou

109
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,066
and collect the votes,
all right?

110
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,403
Get on it.
Do it now.

111
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,805
Jake. This is
my friend, marni.

112
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,473
Great poem.

113
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,542
Your performance
could use a little work.

114
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,577
Let's get a drink.

115
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,779
No, let's get out of here.

116
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,614
Uh, marni is an editor
with windsor house.

117
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,117
Yeah. I'd love to see
some of your work sometime.

118
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,953
Well, Lisa knows
where to find me.

119
00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:49,655
Okay.

120
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:55,027
Tonight's winner of the $50
catchword poetry slam is teezer!

121
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,930
Yeah!

122
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,930
Yeah!

123
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,165
My man!

124
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,133
Baby!

125
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,133
All right!

126
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,436
Bad vote.

127
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,204
But at least you
had something to say.

128
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:08,674
Yeah, well,
the best poet always loses.

129
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,609
Come on.

130
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:13,079
[Crowd chanting
teezer's name]

131
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,315
And it was then that they
decided the human language

132
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,883
did not have enough
of an extensive vocabulary

133
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,353
to withhold the awesome power
of this man's beauty.

134
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,654
And I knew,
right then and there,

135
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,489
that it was my duty
to invent a new word,

136
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,024
one that's so absurd
every time it's heard

137
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,325
it will cause
your pulse to race

138
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:30,062
and simultaneously cause
your face to completely relax.

139
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,630
And it will only be
allowed to be uttered

140
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,332
when a person turns
a poet into a mime,

141
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,434
when they are so fine,
it makes you wonder

142
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,068
if they
are entirely silicone.

Hey, Mr. Berto.

148
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,429
Where is your rent?

149
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:06,866
Well, actually,
uh, right now,

150
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,402
I don't
exactly have it.

151
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,070
The rent.

152
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,906
How about I pay you
a little interest maybe?

153
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,009
You know? Like...

154
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:21,446
Papaya-breasted women,
lounging around a pool,

155
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,617
like, uh,
chameleons by the fire.

156
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,751
One of them smiles
at you,

157
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:31,490
her chili-red lips
whispering Baja sea breezes.

&quot;i want to taste

Of thunderous...

It is the work
of the devil.

00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:37,656
Did you break up,
I hope?

182
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,592
He's so good with words.

183
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,660
You caved in again.

184
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,195
He's egotistical,
unfaithful.

185
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,865
He doesn't care about
anybody but himself.

186
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,333
He cares about me,

187
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,001
and he's talented.

188
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,370
You are such a pushover
for that kind of guy.

189
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,639
His book signing's today.

190
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,745
You are so...So thrilling.

191
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,055
These poems pale
in comparison to your smile.

192
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,967
How are you?

193
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,937
It's time we looked
at more poets.

194
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,539
Oh, please.
Poetry's a money pit.

195
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,973
That's a switch.

196
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,642
You're the one who
brought settles here
in the first place.

197
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,910
He's one of a kind.

198
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,145
He's a star.
He transcends poetry.

199
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,179
Thank you very much.

200
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,482
Poetry is 3% of our list.

201
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,116
But people
are writing poetry,

202
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,218
performing it,
listening to it.

203
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,320
We need to make
a move on this
before it breaks out.

204
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,291
Breaks out?
Like a teenager's face?

205
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,824
[Coughs]

206
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,929
You really
need to gargle.

207
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,564
Well, see
what you can find.

208
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,000
David!

209
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,903
It's a shitty idea.

210
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,111
[Engine stops]

211
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,379
What's going on?

212
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,380
What's up, pal?

213
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:09,481
Check this out.

214
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,051
Depression!
It's sucking me to hell.

215
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,186
Depression!
It's peeling out my soul.

216
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,622
Peeling me,
and then &quot;Orange,&quot;

217
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,457
and I need something
that rhymes with &quot;Orange.&quot;

218
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,693
etch, I don't think
anything rhymes with orange.

219
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,628
I'm going to pop this pencil
right in my eye, man,

220
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:23,896
if I don't figure
this thing out.

221
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,664
Would you help me write
some lyrics for this song?

222
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,766
Ah, I don't do songs.

223
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,867
No, I've got the melody.

224
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,867
It's all done.
It's all in my head.

225
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,136
I just need some words...

226
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,938
About depression and oranges.

227
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,673
I can do depression.

228
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,673
There it is.

229
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,209
All right, uh, we'll
talk about it after lunch.

230
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,444
Promise?

231
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,444
Yeah.

232
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,145
All right.
Well, first of all,

233
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,513
these rolls have
to be back there.

234
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:42,982
That shit's supposed
to go by the door.

235
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,283
They're supposed
to be in the corner.

236
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,484
No. There's no way
that those pieces of shit

237
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,286
are more important
than these pieces of shit.

238
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,089
Well, now,
that's poetic.

239
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,656
Mama.

240
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,891
What's up, mama?

241
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,893
Hey, baby.

242
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,893
Give me love.

243
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,028
Mama?

244
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,963
Etch: Mm-hmm.

245
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,963
You guys know each other?

246
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,398
We know each other
from back in the day.

247
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,233
A little bit.

248
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,233
A little bit.

249
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,300
Don't we?

250
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,002
I told you I wanted
to talk to you.

251
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,571
Okay. Uh, can we do it
outside, though?

252
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,141
Hey, genius! Where do you
think you're going?

253
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,645
I, uh, was just...
What?

254
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,080
You heard what I said.

255
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,248
Lunch.

256
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,849
15 minutes.
That's it.

257
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,389
Ham and peanut butter--
pure protein.

258
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,791
Yeah.

259
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,062
I want to read
some more of your work.

260
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:32,531
Oh, yeah?

261
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,433
Well,
it's not commercial.

262
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,368
You're an expert
on publishing?

263
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,436
No, I just
know what I write.

264
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,774
One of our poets
is getting six figures

265
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,643
to do a basketball shoe
commercial.

266
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,112
How good are you?

267
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:48,847
Really good.

268
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,314
But it doesn't mean shit,

269
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,617
'cause nobody's interested
in hearing it, anyway.

270
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,988
I'm extremely
interested.

271
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,357
Why don't you meet
me after work?

272
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,933
Here's my portfolio.

273
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,602
Are you serious?

274
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,784
Wait, wait, wait,
not that one.

275
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,519
Oh.

276
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,288
I wrote that
after my brother...

277
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,560
Uh, it's just the first poem
I ever wrote.

278
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,462
It's whatever.

279
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,871
You're not going
to be hovering, are you?

280
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:46,905
Uh, no.

281
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,476
I'm going to go to the store.
Do you want anything?

282
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,944
Mm-mmm.

283
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,515
[Door opens]

284
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,394
Jake. What's up,
my friend?

285
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,395
Hey, ralphie.

286
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:12,297
You want a &quot;Vagenmaster&quot;?

287
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,833
Yeah,
but it's &quot;Jagermeister.&quot;

288
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,367
&quot;jagermeister&quot;.

289
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,669
I call it
vagenmaster.

290
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,404
What's the big deal?

291
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:20,806
All right.

292
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,541
It's 5.99.
What's this?

293
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,443
[Laughs]
That's not money.

294
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,411
Come on, man.
That's just papers.

295
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,213
No, no. I gotcha.

296
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,615
Here you go.
Here you go.

297
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,850
All right.
I'll see you later.

298
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:32,885
Hang ten.

299
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,687
You always pissed off?

300
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,258
Just be happy you got out
of bed and took a breath.

301
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,794
Yeah, well, maybe your life's
all happy and shit

302
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,128
'cause you got a good job,

303
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,329
but the rest of the world
is in the toilet, as I see it.

304
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,599
So, basically,
you have two emotions,

305
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,601
anger and sarcasm.

306
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,404
Sarcasm's not an emotion.

307
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,173
Afraid of your own heart?

308
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,509
Heh.

309
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,113
No. I just wish people
would listen, that's all.

310
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:03,314
You need
to market yourself.

311
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:04,817
Enter the poetron slam.

312
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,984
Slams are obviously
not my thing.

313
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,620
I mean, that guy won
with a joke sex poem.

314
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,055
Is that what that was?

315
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,456
The slam's in town.

316
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:13,091
You have nothing to lose.

317
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:15,627
I don't need to win any
spoken word races, thanks.

318
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,329
Think of it
as a career move.

319
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,598
There's paychecks
and pensions in poetry now?

320
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,867
I didn't--
I didn't know.

321
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,802
I'm going to a reading.

322
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,938
You interested?

323
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,673
David: This poem is called

324
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,641
<i> things to do
at a poetry reading</i>

325
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:33,645
<i> when you like a poem,
but nobody else is clapping,</i>

326
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,747
<i> and you don't
want to be the only one.</i>

327
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,415
Try to look moved.

328
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,651
Nod encouragement.

00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:40,718
Sigh.

330
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:43,655
Say, &quot;Hmm.&quot;

331
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,124
try to look very moved.

332
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:48,026
Sneak around and ask
some of the other people

333
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,895
whether or not
they like the poet.

334
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,463
And if they do,

335
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:55,934
make a pact to clap after
the next poem, good or bad.

336
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,769
Giggle.

337
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:58,770
Guffaw.

Shift in your chair,

crossing, re-crossing
your shapely thighs.

342
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,917
Take off your shirt
and wave it at the poet,

343
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,952
like a welcome home.

00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:16,855

Drag in marble block
and sculpt the poet.

349
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,936
Pull out a volume of
Shakespeare's complete works

350
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:33,372
and scratch out
Shakespeare's name

351
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,240
and write in the poet's.

You can learn
a lot from him.

What?
How to be an actor?

357
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,800
He won the poetron slam
last year.

each other and, uh, make magic.

00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:24,908
You're a much better poet.

1077
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,643
Oh, yeah?

1078
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,643
Yeah.

A better lover, too.

1080
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:32,415

Hey, Benny, why don't
you quit drinking?

1087
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:53,002
Why don't you quit boring
the shit out of me?

1088
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:54,571
You know why I drink?

1089

'Cause it makes assholes
like you more interesting.

No, chill out.
That's private, man.

Let me see
what he's writing.

&quot;new fathers often become
photographers, it seems.

1097
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:18,494
&quot;but he took pictures of
many things besides me,

1098
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:21,898
&quot;as if he suddenly felt it
all slipping away

1099
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:23,833
and he wanted
to hold it forever.&quot;

1100

Gabe, you see this?

1102
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:28,904
Yeah. Yeah. But what you
don't understand, youngster,

1103
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:32,342
is that my man, Benny,
he was the greatest.

1104
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,777
He had a poem published
in<i> the new yorker.</i>

1105

A major literary success
at 19.

1106
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,817
He was supposed to be
the next Allen Ginsberg.

of Ginsberg himself.

1108

Wow.

1109
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,423
So, uh,
what happened to him?

1110
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:49,659
He felt he could never
live up to that poem again,

1111
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,194
so he never published
anything afterwards.

1112

it's really good.

some complicated steps,

to come back.

I want you to know.

1252
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,145
I don't blame anyone else
but myself

1253
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:37,346
for being HIV-positive.

1254
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:39,882
It doesn't matter.

1255
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:41,518
Marni,
it doesn't matter.

1256
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,358
I'm here.

1257
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:55,064
I want to
be here with you.

1258
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,672
I love you.

1259
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:08,243
You're still not very good
with improvs.

1260
00:59:16,785 --> 00:59:19,555
I'm gonna take a nap.

1261
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:20,957
Okay?

1262
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:26,862
Woman: The beauty comes
from the difficulty,

1263
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:28,564
the complexity,

1264
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:31,033
the trap door ever giving way
to other trap door,

1265
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,468
infinite capacity of life.

1266
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:34,637
It is amazing,

1267
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,472
and the fact that we
survive it is amazing.

1268
00:59:36,505 --> 00:59:39,141
And the fact
that we suffer is beautiful,

1269
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:41,177
because we are
suffering in jewels.

1270
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,946
We are glittering in the sun
with all the decadent,

1271
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:47,450
superb richness
of our life's experience

1272
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,418
dripping from our fingers

1273
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:52,421
and our wrists
and the tips of our hair.

1274
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:55,658
And when we leave this world
and walk into the opal light

1275
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:57,759
that we have come
to think of as god,

1276
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,096
we will not go naked.

1277
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,031
We will go
glittering.

1278
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:04,767
The poem list
looks great.

1279
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,169
There's just something
missing.

1280
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,237
Did you get
what I asked for?

1281
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,383
I didn't like doing it.

1282
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,284
The slam material
has to be original.

1283
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:24,086
Look,
don't worry about that.

1284
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,554
It's not right.

1285
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:27,123
Great imagery.

1286
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,725
Who is this guy,
anyway?

1287
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:33,395
He's a genius that looks and
sounds like a pile of garbage.

1288
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,264
I buy some stuff from him
every once in a while.

1289
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,099
You can win without it.

1290
01:00:37,132 --> 01:00:39,435
I got a lot riding on tomorrow,
and so do you.

1291
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:42,004
If I succeed, you succeed,
so don't sweat it.

1292
01:00:42,037 --> 01:00:44,540
What, all
we need's a couple
of mispronounced words?

1293
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:45,941
That's right.

1294
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:48,644
And I got a plan
that's gonna take him down.

1295
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:51,214
He's gonna throw his poem list
right out the window.

1296
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,118
It's going to be all right.

1297
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:09,198
What are you doing?

1298
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:10,700
I got up an hour ago.

1299
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,902
I took a shower
to let you sleep.

1300
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,837
Come on. Let's get you home
and out of those clothes.

1301
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,305
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1302
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:17,640
You're sick.

1303
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:19,475
You can't
just get up and walk
out of the hospital.

1304
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:22,544
I'm not missing this
for anything, okay?

1305
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,013
I awakened this morning.

1306
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:25,714
I was filled with despair.

1307
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,583
Darkness surrounded me.

1308
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:30,453
Death hung heavy
on my shoulders.

1309
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,321
I saw no reason to live.

1310
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:34,622
And then, I remembered
what today held.

1311
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:36,558
I saw a window of light,

1312
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:37,993
a reason to be.

1313
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:39,428
And now, I'm here.

1314
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:42,631
Welcome to the Los Angeles
poetron slam!

1315
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,205
Today, the finest poets
on the west coast

1316
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,808
will compete
for a $25,000 cash prize,

1317
01:01:52,841 --> 01:01:56,912
plus a paid series of readings,
a spoken word cd contract,

1318
01:01:56,945 --> 01:01:59,815
and a publishing deal
by our wonderful sponsors,

1319
01:01:59,848 --> 01:02:01,116
windsor house press,

1320
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,286
represented here today
by Mr. Marc neihauser!

1321
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,988
[Applause]

1322
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:08,557
Welcome, Marc!

1323
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,159
And now,
from out of the west,

1324
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:12,628
come the thundering hoofbeats
of our first contestant.

1325
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:17,700
From the tumbleweed world
of cowboy poetry, Fresno Pete!

1326
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:20,336
[Applause]

1327
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:20,336
Yee-ha!

1328
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,872
There's two things in life
I really love.

1329
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,207
That's women and horses.

1330
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,142
This, I'm sure of.

1331
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:31,514
So when I die,
you please tan my hide

1332
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:35,117
and tool me
into a saddle so fine

1333
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,721
and give me to a cowgirl
who likes to ride,

1334
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,156
so in the hereafter,

1335
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,258
I may rest

1336
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,594
between the two things
I love the best.

1337
01:02:45,627 --> 01:02:48,764
Woman:
You tell 'em, cowboy!

1338
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:50,266
Longfellow:
Thank you, Pete.

1339
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,668
There's a real man, who makes
plans for sex even after death.

1340
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:54,570
Now, let's check in
with our esteemed judges.

1341
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:57,106
[Applause]

1342
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:58,474
Good work, partner.

1343
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:00,276
And now, it's high noon.

1344
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:03,512
And here's a man who has
a showdown with a cowboy poet,

1345
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:04,580
Jake Thompson!

1346
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:05,982
Man: Yeah!

1347
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:11,354
Let's see what you got,
poetry boy.

1348
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:15,424
&quot;how many fights have
you been in?&quot; She asks,

1349
01:03:15,457 --> 01:03:17,993
holding my hand,

1350
01:03:18,026 --> 01:03:21,931
running a painted fingernail
around big, angry knuckles,

1351
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,933
rubbing faint, pink scars,
as if to make a wish.

1352
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,937
Spreading fingers wide,
I show her my digits,

1353
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,538
all twisted and bent
with the force of impact!

1354
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:31,674
Man: Yeah!

1355
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:36,011
&quot;just one,&quot;
I say to her,

1356
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:38,013
&quot;and I'm getting
my ass kicked.&quot;

1357
01:03:38,046 --> 01:03:39,816
[applause]

1358
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:49,291
Least I lost to something
I understand.

1359
01:03:49,324 --> 01:03:50,593
All right, man.
Take care.

1360
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:55,663
That felt so good.
I can't believe it.

1361
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,766
They're not all going
to be that easy, okay?

1362
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:59,101
You have to keep
your level up.

1363
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:00,302
I want you
to look at the judges.

1364
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:02,204
Are you okay?

1365
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:02,204
I'm fine.

1366
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:03,205
Don't worry about me.

1367
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:04,673
Worry about the competition.

1368
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:07,977
Next up is a man
who never rides sidesaddle,

1369
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,246
chrome Harley.

1370
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:11,480
Woman: Yeah, baby!

1371
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:14,750
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!
You're ready to move!

1372
01:04:14,783 --> 01:04:18,754
Scour oily hand,
comb hair smooth.

1373
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:21,457
Pull out all 8 glistening feet
of hand-polished

1374
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,394
heaven reflection,
petted to perfection.

1375
01:04:25,427 --> 01:04:27,029
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

1376
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:30,065
The power to part traffic
like a modernized Moses.

1377
01:04:30,098 --> 01:04:32,534
Other drivers know
a monster-style machine

1378
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:33,702
when they see one.

1379
01:04:33,735 --> 01:04:35,337
[Applause]

1380
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:38,774
They say in the flattest
part of north Dakota

1381
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:41,509
on a starless,
moonless night,

1382
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:42,811
no breath of wind,

1383
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:47,049
a man can light a candle
and walk away.

1384
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,517
And every now and then,

1385
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,053
he can turn and
see the candle burning.

1386
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:52,388
17 miles later,

1387
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,691
provided the conditions
remained ideal,

1388
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:57,660
he could
still see the flame.

1389
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,396
Somewhere between
the 17th and 18th mile,

1390
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,097
he would lose sight
of the flame.

1391
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,799
If he were walking backwards,

1392
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:06,134
he would know
the exact moment he lost it.

1393
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,038
He could take a step forward
and find it again.

1394
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,572
Back and forth,

1395
01:05:10,605 --> 01:05:12,341
dark to light,

1396
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:13,808
light to dark.

1397
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:17,046
What is this place
where the light disappears?

1398
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,748
Where it reappears?

1399
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:22,084
Don't tell me
about eyeballs and photons,

1400
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:23,752
reflection, refraction.

1401
01:05:23,785 --> 01:05:26,587
Don't tell me about
186,000 miles per second,

1402
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,257
the theory of relativity.

1403
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:31,393
Because all I know
is that place

1404
01:05:31,426 --> 01:05:35,163
where the light appears
and disappears,

1405
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,866
that's the place
where we live.

1406
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:42,371
[Applause]

1407
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:47,910
Yes!

done anything with it,

to choosing
a dead-end lifestyle,

That's pretty cold.

The angry poet is a cliche
for a good reason,

1581
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:31,072
and it's so much easier
than being responsible.

01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:29,397
hunker down
with the small mammals

1602
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:32,234
who strut their stuff
in hopes of being eaten.

1603
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,501
Woman: That's right!

1604
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:36,104
Of being the next big splash
at the water hole.

1605
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:37,339
Man: Whoo!

1606
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:45,780
It is an a-vomitation!

1607
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:49,985
And an insult
to good food, I say,

1608
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:54,623
leafing through magazines
with titles like<i> cook me twice,</i>

1609
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,392
<i> feel me, fax me,
facelift me,</i>

1610
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,828
<i> kiss my software, fat-free.</i>

1611
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:03,465
What do I do when I
see a poet entrepreneur,

1612
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:08,602
throwing bread crumbs,
surrounded by greedy pigeons?

1613
01:15:08,636 --> 01:15:11,840
Do I keep them?

1614
01:15:11,873 --> 01:15:14,075
Eat them?

1615
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:16,378
Or set them free?

1616
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,281
[Bang]

1617
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,281
[Applause and cheering]

1618
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,952
What?

1619
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:26,455
[Audience booing]

1620
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:32,895
<i> The quilt.</i>

1621
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:38,767
There's a quetzal bird on it,
an aztec warrior,

1622
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,236
a field of maize.

1623
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:44,139
There's yarn in it
as blue as the sky,

1624
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,839
as auburn as her hair,

1625
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:48,476
as maroon as her nipples.

1626
01:15:48,509 --> 01:15:51,580
How many times have
we made love under the quilt?

1627
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:53,481
How many times
we just couldn't wait,

1628
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:55,684
tearing like sharks
at each other?

1629
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:59,654
The quilt has seen me
draw blood from her neck,

1630
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:02,090
her arms, her inner thighs,

1631
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:04,793
her feet hoisted
around my ears.

1632
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:08,430
The quilt has seen her
suck on me like salvation.

1633
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,264
The quilt has heard
every permutation

1634
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:14,835
of our grunts, gasps,
screams, groans, and sighs.

1635
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:18,973
It has felt our bodies bounce,
thrash, quiver, then subside.

1636
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:22,477
It has seen me bend her
over her desk,

1637
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:25,146
in the bathtub,
up against the wall,

1638
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,716
so hard that we made
a picture of Kurt cobain

1639
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,550
fall down on her head.

1640
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:31,686
It has heard her ask me,

1641
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:33,588
&quot;am I sick?

1642
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:36,491
&quot;all I want to do is screw.

1643
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:39,260
I want to be your slut,&quot;
She said,

1644
01:16:39,293 --> 01:16:41,096
spread-eagle on the quilt.

1645
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:46,635
&quot;i want to be your ho,
your tramp, your bitch.&quot;

1646
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,068
I feel sick.

1647
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,305
Here, sit down.

1648
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:52,440
You're okay.
You're okay.

1649
01:16:52,473 --> 01:16:57,746
Well, she has
a new master today,

1650
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,216
a yapping cross
between a pug and pekingese,

1651
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,486
infesting her quilt
with ticks and fleas.

1652
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,856
But every time
I call her name...

1653
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:08,857
[Whistles &quot;Here&quot;]

1654
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,125
[Clicks tongue]

1655
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,694
She still comes.

1656
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:14,830
[Applause
and cheering]

1657
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,849
<i> Reading animal sex ads.</i>

1658
01:17:35,883 --> 01:17:37,818
First personal:

1659
01:17:37,852 --> 01:17:41,723
&quot;amoeba with a hard-on,

1660
01:17:41,756 --> 01:17:43,825
sweetly headed your way.&quot;

1661
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:45,727
[laughter]

1662
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:45,727
Whoa!

1663
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,128
What? Too personal?

1664
01:17:47,161 --> 01:17:50,298
Well, how about, uh,
&quot;Tom t. Cat,

1665
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:53,935
&quot;furry kiss and tell,

1666
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:56,638
&quot;all flipped and gritty...

1667
01:17:56,671 --> 01:18:01,676
Swinging from doors
in a tomcat sex motel.&quot;

1668
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,044
mm.

1669
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:05,180
And ad number three says,

1670
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,014
&quot;monkey trapeze artist,

1671
01:18:07,048 --> 01:18:10,418
&quot;swinging through your genitals
like they was breadfruit

1672
01:18:10,451 --> 01:18:11,586
&quot;and banana trees.

1673
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:14,255
You know, naturalism
is a way of life.&quot;

1674
01:18:14,288 --> 01:18:15,389
[laughter]

1675
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:21,830
Monkey kitty!
What's goin' on, huh?

1676
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,032
What? Cat got your tongue?

1677
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:26,634
Or could it be you are...

1678
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:31,106
Not well hung?

1679
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,907
And maybe
all of this is like,

1680
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:36,443
you know, well,
uh, overcompensation?

1681
01:18:36,477 --> 01:18:37,912
Anybody got a microscope?

1682
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:41,349
These ads don't
excite my animal nature,

1683
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:43,317
so I will sit and...

1684
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,223
Woman: Go!

1685
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:49,291
Man: Come on.

1686
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,473
And turn out the lights...

1687
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:09,611
And stay there...

1688
01:19:11,612 --> 01:19:14,049
Until love comes to me...

1689
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:18,720
Like a beautiful beast
that sees in the dark.

1690
01:19:18,753 --> 01:19:21,956
That's the mistake David
was looking for.

1691
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:27,929
[Scoffs]

1692
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,634
[Applause and cheering]

1693
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:33,902
At the end
of the third round,

1694
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:38,740
the score is
Jake Thompson, 119.6,

1695
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:42,177
David settles, 123.3.

1696
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,378
Quite close.

1697
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,647
The final round of poetry
is improvisation.

1698
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,817
Let's see if their minds
are as fast as their mouths.

1699
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:49,918
[Whispering] Jake.

1700
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,520
She's really getting sick.
It's bad.

1701
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,823
Let's get her
to the hospital, huh?

1702
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,358
Leave me alone.

1703
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,358
No.

1704
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:58,726
You're down
by four, okay?

1705
01:19:58,759 --> 01:20:00,528
You need to put up
big points to win.

1706
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:02,330
Baby,
I am worried about you.

1707
01:20:02,363 --> 01:20:03,498
We are getting
out of here.

1708
01:20:03,531 --> 01:20:05,200
Remember
what you have to do.

1709
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:07,235
Keep it short and sweet.

1710
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:12,140
Baby, look at you.
I can't.

1711
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,681
10 seconds
is even longer than that.

1712
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,417
Think association.

1713
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,318
Search your heart
for the poem.

1714
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:26,187
In this final round
of improvisation,

1715
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,157
each poet will receive a word
that I pull out of my...

1716
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,892
Hat.

1717
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,892
[Laughter]

1718
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:33,928
Using that word, they have
10 seconds to begin the poem.

1719
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:37,365
If either poet fails to begin
the poem within 10 seconds,

1720
01:20:37,398 --> 01:20:39,667
they forfeit that round.

1721
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,936
Mr. Settles...

1722
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:45,573
Your word is &quot;Coral&quot;.

1723
01:20:45,606 --> 01:20:46,608
Coral.

1724
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:54,148
I don't want just a screw.

1725
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:55,950
I want deeper in,

1726
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:57,785
infect her with myself.

1727
01:20:57,818 --> 01:21:01,256
Grow like a live coral
under a flap of skin.

1728
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:04,325
I want to deform her,
swell her belly,

1729
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:06,694
ruin her
in the eyes of other men.

1730
01:21:06,727 --> 01:21:08,796
I want to confirm
her suspicions.

1731
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:11,633
I am infectious,
precaution-less,

1732
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:14,202
virile, masculine.

1733
01:21:14,235 --> 01:21:15,503
[Applause and cheers]

1734
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:18,039
Man: Oh, yeah!

1735
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:19,841
Let's see
the judges' scores.

1736
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,309
7.8.

1737
01:21:22,443 --> 01:21:24,879
7.5.

1738
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:26,848
7.4

1739
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,750
7.7

1740
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,853
and 7.5.

1741
01:21:31,886 --> 01:21:33,087
Ladies and gentlemen,

1742
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,224
that is
the highest combined score

1743
01:21:36,257 --> 01:21:37,791
ever given
for an improvisation

1744
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:40,260
at the Los Angeles
poetron slam.

1745
01:21:40,294 --> 01:21:41,930
[Applause]

1746
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:47,669
And the total score
for David settles is 161.2,

1747
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:50,004
a marvelous score.

1748
01:21:50,037 --> 01:21:51,406
Mr. Thompson...

1749
01:21:53,874 --> 01:21:58,146
Your word is &quot;Laughter.&quot;

1750
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,948
laughter, Mr. Thompson.

1751
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:02,183
You have 10 seconds.

1752
01:22:34,181 --> 01:22:36,050
She laughs in her sleep.

1753
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:41,255
Next to her, I wrestle
with the covers I made, but...

1754
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:45,260
Cannot sleep in...

1755
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:51,965
When I am seized by a noise,
loud by itself,

1756
01:22:51,999 --> 01:22:56,170
but barely
more than a breath...

1757
01:22:58,472 --> 01:23:01,742
Like a hiccup licking a gasp.

1758
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,879
Laughter.

1759
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:10,018
She laughs in her sleep...

1760
01:23:11,919 --> 01:23:15,823
As the moon and stars
conspire

1761
01:23:15,856 --> 01:23:18,693
to transform tears
of the day before...

1762
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,429
Into silver laughter...

1763
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:28,336
As if, together, they share
some secret joke...

1764
01:23:30,704 --> 01:23:37,545
For all those willing
to simply relax and listen.

1765
01:23:40,514 --> 01:23:45,753
And while I'm distracted
by my lover's laughter,

1766
01:23:45,786 --> 01:23:48,823
the stealthy moon
creeps across the room...

1767
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:53,495
And kisses me to sleep.

1768
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:07,742
This is the first time
I have ever forgotten my name.

1769
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:25,894
[Applause and cheering]

1770
01:24:43,043 --> 01:24:45,746
All right, let's check
the judges' scores.

1771
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:48,015
7.4.

1772
01:24:48,048 --> 01:24:51,385
[Audience muttering
and booing]

1773
01:24:51,418 --> 01:24:53,321
This is a joke.
Let's get out of here.

1774
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,622
Wait a minute.

1775
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:56,057
Longfellow: 8.2

1776
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:58,459
8.2

1777
01:24:58,492 --> 01:24:59,727
[applause growing louder]

1778
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,029
8.4.

1779
01:25:03,063 --> 01:25:04,866
And 9.1,

1780
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:09,670
for a new combined
improvisational record of 41.3,

1781
01:25:09,703 --> 01:25:12,373
for a total of 160.9

1782
01:25:12,406 --> 01:25:14,175
that's great.

1783
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,809
Not quite great enough.

1784
01:25:15,843 --> 01:25:21,148
David settles is the winner
of the Los Angeles poetron slam!

1785
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:22,450
That's bullshit.

1786
01:25:22,483 --> 01:25:24,452
Come on,
we're going.

1787
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,524
Here's the money.

1788
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:32,927
David, come on over
and collect
your $25,000.

1789
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,195
Congratulations.

1790
01:25:34,228 --> 01:25:35,363
Thank you, sir.

1792
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,801
<i> Traces of me.</i>

1793
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:44,272
Lipstick marks
on a letter I sent.

1794
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,241
Credit card receipts.

1795
01:25:47,374 --> 01:25:50,211
What's left after a day?

1796
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:51,812
After a life?

1797
01:25:51,845 --> 01:25:55,116
What if I'm just a child's
chalk drawing in the street?

1798
01:25:55,149 --> 01:25:56,851
What happens if it rains?

1799
01:25:56,884 --> 01:26:00,788
I found you when I fell through
the cracks in the sidewalk.

1800
01:26:00,821 --> 01:26:04,325
How much time
I've got for me

1801
01:26:04,358 --> 01:26:07,995
means just how much time
I've got to be with you.

1802
01:26:08,028 --> 01:26:11,266
Now, with you, I want
to be outfitted for life.

1803
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,869
But it might
just be summer wear.

1804
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:18,472
Maybe I'm only a butterfly,

1805
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:19,674
like it or not.

1806
01:26:21,308 --> 01:26:25,280
Please find my letter
in the folds of my wings.

1807
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:29,083
[Light applause]

1808
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,825
You did great.

1809
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,825
I feel great.

1810
01:26:37,858 --> 01:26:38,859
That was great.

1811
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:40,260
You're not a poetry
virgin anymore.

1812
01:26:40,294 --> 01:26:41,262
I know.
Thank you.

1813
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:42,296
That was excellent.

1814
01:26:42,329 --> 01:26:43,931
This calls
for a drink, no?

1815
01:26:43,964 --> 01:26:44,932
Yes.

1816
01:26:44,965 --> 01:26:46,367
Marc: Ahem.

1817
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,134
Marni.

1818
01:26:48,168 --> 01:26:50,471
Marc.

1819
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,742
I need you
to come back to work.

1820
01:26:54,775 --> 01:26:57,945
I've still got the virus.

1821
01:26:57,978 --> 01:26:59,180
I know, I know.

1822
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,617
And I'm sorry.

1823
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,653
I-I-I thought
about it a lot,

1824
01:27:05,686 --> 01:27:07,255
and I reacted very badly.

1825
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:12,293
I got my own hang-ups.
I mean...

1826
01:27:12,326 --> 01:27:15,529
We can work together.

1827
01:27:15,562 --> 01:27:17,331
We always have.

1828
01:27:17,364 --> 01:27:19,133
She needs health care.

1829
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:21,836
Health care, back pay,
whatever it takes.

1830
01:27:23,103 --> 01:27:24,605
Let's talk on Monday.

1831
01:27:24,638 --> 01:27:26,641
Deal.

1832
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,942
Deal.

1833
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,946
You were terrific
at the slam.

1834
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:35,415
Did you see his bow tie?

1835
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:36,717
Stop.

1836
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,520
All right! All right!
Listen up!

1837
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:42,623
The moment you've
been waiting for has come!

1838
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:45,259
The winner
of tonight's slam is...

1839
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,028
Our own Benny!

1840
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:48,629
Ohh!

1841
01:27:48,662 --> 01:27:50,431
[Applause]

1842

[Feedback]

1843
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,036
Hey.

1844
01:27:56,937 --> 01:28:00,574
Well, the best poet
always loses.

1845
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:02,143
Mm-mmm.

1846
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,511
Not anymore.

1847
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:12,653
And then they were married.

1848
01:28:12,686 --> 01:28:14,455
They had one child,

1849
01:28:14,488 --> 01:28:18,526
a healthy, lanky,
dark-haired boy.

1850
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,762
They lived in
a green house with a yard,

1851
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:25,399
and the next-door neighbor
made rhubarb pies.

1852
01:28:25,432 --> 01:28:27,201
One year,
they went to France

1853
01:28:27,234 --> 01:28:31,339
and visited
the grave of rimbaud.

1854
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:35,242
A young couple
laughed at them.

1855
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:37,577
Is that enough?
