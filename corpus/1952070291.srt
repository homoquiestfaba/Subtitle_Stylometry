1
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:26,436
Thank you so much
for coming.

2
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,073
- Another woman disappeared, you said?
- Yes.

3
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:32,243
Many more spirits
in this place, Miss Ellen.

4
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:35,616
Many more.

5
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,856
I'm inside.

6
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:47,830
Women.

7
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:49,528
Pain.

8
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,868
<i>Anger.</i>

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,508
<i>Sit down.</i>

10
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:00,273
Sin is where it started.

11
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:03,146
Atonement at the top.

12
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:05,412
Build me to the heavens

13
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,147
and life never stops.

14
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:11,987
Build me to the heavens
and life never stops.

15
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:13,355
Join me.

16
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:23,192
Build me to the heavens
and life never stops.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,837
Really,
this is quite enough.

18
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:31,070
Stop it, I say.

19
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,546
Sin is where it started.
Atonement from the top.

20
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,980
Life without death.
Life without death.

21
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,280
There will be no more
sin in this house.

22
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:43,752
- Enough, I say!
- Thank you, Rose Red.

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,418
I'll be damned if I have to put up
with this in my own house.

24
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,450
You're damned already, sir.

25
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:50,792
Your damnations feed her.

26
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:54,827
I will never stop building you.

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,639
(voices whispering)

28
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,810
(knocking)

29
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,283
You've changed.

30
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:22,988
Did you bring them?

31
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:27,963
Thank you.

32
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:31,595
No.

33
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:34,696
I gave you that charade.

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,833
You're my wife
and I want to come in.

35
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:40,107
Not tonight.
No.

36
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:42,307
- I have work to do.
- Work?

37
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,146
A wife's work,
yes, you do.

38
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,516
I will scream, John.
I will scream and bring

39
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,885
the entire staff to this room.
Is that what you want?

40
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,389
You know
what I want.

41
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,449
You owe me.

42
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:56,462
I urge you to consider
this very carefully.

43
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:58,930
Not tonight.

44
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:04,025
We'll see.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,179
<i>Ellen's voice: "I write now
out of desperation.</i>

46
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,292
<i>I feel danger everywhere
around Sukeena and me.</i>

47
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,663
<i>Now I understand what I couldn't
know seven years ago.</i>

48
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,100
<i>What I wasn't
ready to know.</i>

49
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:40,867
<i>There's another world
here in Rose Red.</i>

50
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,636
<i>A spirit world.</i>

51
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:44,472
<i>And it's dangerous. "</i>

52
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,489
Well?

53
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,958
If that dress doesn't do it,
I don't know what will.

54
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,551
You're irresistible.

55
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:05,428
John Rimbauer has resisted
marriage for how many years?

56
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,193
Not you.
Not this time.

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,861
Thank you
for being here.

58
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,563
For being such
a dear friend.

59
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:13,435
You're more like
an aunt to me.

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,331
In a way, I wish Doug
wasn't John's partner,

61
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:20,607
for if this doesn't work out,
I'd hate to lose you.

62
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:23,547
You will never
lose me, my dear girl.

63
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,349
<i>You mustn't allow that to influence
your feeling towards John.</i>

64
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,047
(honking)

65
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:37,251
<i>Ellen,</i>

66
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,764
John is not like
other men, he...

67
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,532
He what?

68
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,595
Never mind.
Let's go downstairs.

69
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,869
<i>Ellen's voice:
"What I didn't realize then,</i>

70
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:52,071
<i>was my relationship was not to be
with a man whom I dearly loved,</i>

71
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,978
<i>but instead with a house,
a grand house.</i>

72
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:57,448
<i>A house that would
soon come to own me.</i>

73
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,542
<i>Indeed, would
come to own itself. "</i>

74
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:02,678
I don't know, Daniel.

75
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:04,622
You could find
yourself out of a job.

76
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:07,717
- She's a real beauty.
- Yes.

77
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:11,086
She is at that.

78
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,623
Ah!

79
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:22,967
Connie.

80
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:26,308
Ellen, I'd like you to meet Daniel,
my driver and all round accomplice.

81
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:28,973
- My pleasure.
- What an unusual day for a drive.

82
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,210
Well, yes.
Unless you'd like to reconsider?

83
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,115
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- Good.

84
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,351
- Have fun, you two.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,558
Have you ever ridden
in a motorcar before?

86
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,331
- There's a first time for everything.
- Indeed there is.

87
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,771
Well hold on. This may prove
to be a bumpy ride.

88
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,309
What kind of surprise?

89
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:09,515
Well, it wouldn't be a surprise
if I told you, now would it?

90
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:12,353
- You're incorrigible.
- Guilty.

91
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:37,910
You're a tease
and a flirt.

92
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,249
"How poor are they
that have not patience.

93
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:44,745
What wound did ever
heal but by degrees?"

94
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,849
Indeed. But would
even Othello

95
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:48,826
have had
patience for a man

96
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:51,159
who fails to state
his true intentions?

97
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:53,529
A woman who knows
her Shakespeare

98
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,830
and yet knows little
of a man's true intentions.

99
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:05,834
Could we get past the kissing
if we were engaged?

100
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:08,176
Are you proposing,
John Rimbauer?

101
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:10,205
And if I were?

102
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,410
I thought only
mystics and mediums

103
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,976
answer a question
with another question.

104
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,488
Mysticism.
You?

105
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,753
Another question.

106
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,783
I can see I have
my work cut out for me.

107
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:25,253
Close your eyes.

108
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:44,410
Now open them.

109
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:01,329
Shipped all the way
from England.

110
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,358
Brick by brick.

111
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,336
I told you
I had a surprise.

112
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:21,585
Excuse me.

113
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,110
<i>- Morning, John.
- Doug.</i>

114
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,949
Campbell won't
unload again today.

115
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,859
Ellen, so good to see you.
You look ravishing.

116
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:31,385
Thank you.

117
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,456
- I just left your dear wife.
- Did you?

118
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,025
- And how is she?
- Ellen.

119
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:39,003
This is Jack Finney,
my contractor.

120
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,563
Jack, this is my dear friend
Ellen Gillhurst.

121
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,097
Pleased to meet you.

122
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:45,610
Seems there's a little dispute
over some shipping charges.

123
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,737
Nothing serious, but I do
have to deal with it.

124
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,872
Excuse me.

125
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,380
May I show you
the grounds?

126
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,783
Well, all right.

127
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:56,481
- Sign for this!
- Talk to billionaire John Rimbauer.

128
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:58,513
I don't care who
John Rimbauer is...

129
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:00,548
That's fine with me,
because you're fired!

130
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,619
So what brings you out here?
Certainly not the oil business.

131
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:06,491
- Hardly.
- Didn't you know?

132
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:09,433
Mr. Posey's to oversee the completion
of the project while you two...

133
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,830
While we two what?

134
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,170
Another surprise?

135
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:21,643
<i>Man: Shotgun!</i>

136
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:42,194
This is to be
our home, Ellen.

137
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,096
That is,
if you'll have me.

138
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:46,126
(gunshot)

139
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,605
What was that,
John?

140
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:51,235
<i>Man:
He shot O'Reilly!</i>

141
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:54,469
Not to worry, John.
We'll look into it.

142
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,544
The timing.

143
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,608
Is it a sign?
Am I to take it as a sign?

144
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,552
Now, now,
it's nothing.

145
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:04,317
Just an arguing
pair of drunks, that's all.

146
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,551
They're Irish, Ellen.

147
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,026
Nothing?
Can we be so sure?

148
00:10:10,562 --> 00:10:12,553
Would you be my wife,
Ellen?

149
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,925
It is what you want,
isn't it?

150
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,631
Mrs. John Rimbauer?

151
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,334
Yes.

152
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,365
Yes, of course.

153
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,387
<i>Man:
He wasn't even armed.</i>

154
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,836
She'll be fine.
The luckiest girl in all Seattle.

155
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,464
<i>She'll need all
the luck she can find.</i>

156
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,269
What was that, Fanny?

157
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:59,277
A woman makes her luck.
You'll be fine.

158
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:04,107
That name, Rose Red,
your choice or John's, Ellen?

159
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:05,548
Oh, Ellen's of course.

160
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:08,018
John has already accepted
that the house is hers.

161
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,918
<i>I'd be careful...</i>

162
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:13,288
making assumptions
where John's concerned.

163
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,156
<i>Get it off your chest, Fanny.</i>

164
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:16,491
It's just us girls.

165
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,996
<i>Admit it.
You're envious.</i>

166
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,795
You had your chance
with John and now...

167
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,028
Ladies, it's all right.
John and I have discussed everything.

168
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:30,098
Including his past.

169
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,474
It's just that
and nothing more.

170
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:35,105
<i>You know what
they say about the past.</i>

171
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:38,378
It does have a habit
of repeating itself.

172
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,784
Only for those who fail
to heed its warning.

173
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,222
<i>Yes, well...</i>

174
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:48,522
if only one could
see around corners.

175
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,287
<i>There's a woman I know,
a spiritualist.</i>

176
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:55,266
Take my word, she can see
into the past and the future.

177
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,961
Perhaps we should
pay her a visit.

178
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,129
A medium?
A conjurer?

179
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:01,799
- A mystic.
- Is it so out of the question,

180
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,604
to have the ability to see
into the beyond?

181
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:06,304
No, thank you.

182
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:08,040
I have all the beyond
I can handle.

183
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,741
A wedding,
a honeymoon.

184
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:13,240
John and I are to tour the world
until the house is completed.

185
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,549
I understand,
even appreciate your concern.

186
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,581
<i>And I accept that each of us
may know John differently.</i>

187
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,856
As for me...

188
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:24,886
I love him
with all my heart.

189
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,889
But it's his heart
you must contend with.

190
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,993
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that, Fanny.

191
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,068
<i>"We're bound for Africa.</i>

192
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:41,670
<i>Or perhaps,</i>

193
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:44,307
<i>based on my husband's
appetites</i>

194
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,214
<i>and strange frenzies,</i>

195
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:48,219
<i>for hell itself.</i>

196
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,620
<i>He is never cool.</i>

197
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,688
<i>Never satisfied.</i>

198
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:01,756
<i>Never quite sane.</i>

199
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,063
<i>Not even enough
is enough.</i>

200
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:13,003
<i>He is changing me, too.</i>

201
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,070
<i>Perhaps not
for the better. "</i>

202
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:16,604
(tribal music plays)

203
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:41,159
You.

204
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,733
I'm called Sukeena.

205
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,739
Maybe next time
I try to help you,

206
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,468
you'll listen.

207
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,700
He's on safari, ma'am.

208
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:55,235
It'll be a few days, yet.

209
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,181
Am I dying?

210
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,285
No.

211
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:05,790
It's an unmentionable
disease,

212
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:08,554
<i>carried by men
and suffered by women.</i>

213
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,529
It shall pass,
for you.

214
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,861
For him, the man...

215
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,526
not so easy.

216
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:18,997
Come, drink this.

217
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:20,902
Will it heal me?

218
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:27,177
No.

219
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:29,772
Only the power heals us.

220
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:32,750
You do believe in the power,
don't you?

221
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,679
I see it in you, ma'am.

222
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:37,780
You do?

223
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:40,690
A welcome sight it is.

224
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,751
Damn John Rimbauer.

225
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:45,854
<i>- I'll never forgive him.
- Of course you will!</i>

226
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:48,798
It's a wife's way
to learn forgiveness.

227
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,699
Even for men like him.

228
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,904
<i>I'll help you.</i>

229
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:01,978
<i>- They're here!
- Come on!</i>

230
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,557
Welcome to Rose Red, dear.

231
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,101
Our new home.

232
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,781
Do you like it?

233
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:22,555
It's big.

234
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:24,585
If you like big,
it's all right.

235
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,826
That's all?
Just big?

236
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:30,630
<i>It's an oil tycoon's house,
certainly.</i>

237
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,864
But it's not the house
that makes the home, John,

238
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:34,701
but the people
who are in it.

239
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,172
We had some fun,
didn't we?

240
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,235
Our exploring?

241
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,379
It wasn't all bad, was it?

242
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,509
Not all bad, no.

243
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,212
You see?

244
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,585
<i>One must always
keep an open mind,</i>

245
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:53,386
allow oneself
to enjoy life.

246
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:57,186
I don't want to feel
alone here, John.

247
00:17:57,229 --> 00:18:00,494
I didn't marry
to feel so alone.

248
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:03,695
<i>Voices whispering:
I don't want to feel alone here, John.</i>

249
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,600
<i>I didn't marry
to feel so alone.</i>

250
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,766
<i>Man: Sir?</i>

251
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:12,072
<i>John:
A moment, please.</i>

252
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,271
The luggage has arrived.

253
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:15,904
Excuse me.

254
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,345
Well, what do you
think of her?

255
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:26,915
She is more than
just a house, ma'am.

256
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,324
She is, isn't she?

257
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,352
But not yet a home.

258
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,387
A home is made
of hearts,

259
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:36,128
not wood and glass.

260
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:40,832
John: I say we celebrate
our return.

261
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,704
Ellen:
A party. Why not?

262
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:47,473
John: Lt'll be the grandest,
most glamorous party

263
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:49,377
Seattle has ever seen.

264
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:52,406
(waltz playing)

265
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:11,194
- (glass clinking)
- (music stops)

266
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,932
<i>John:
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.</i>

267
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:17,305
<i>I raise my glass to you.</i>

268
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:19,902
Would you please
raise your glasses

269
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:22,641
on this,
her inaugural ball...

270
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,979
to Rose Red?

271
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:26,278
Here, here!

272
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:30,015
And of course, not forgetting
my beautiful bride...

273
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:32,353
Ellen Rimbauer.

274
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,347
<i>All:
Here, here!</i>

275
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:36,622
<i>John: Please, please.
Enjoy yourselves.</i>

276
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,720
<i>- Thank you.
- Cheers.</i>

277
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,856
(music resumes)

278
00:19:57,148 --> 00:19:59,309
Finally, my two
dearest friends meet.

279
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:03,515
Sukeena coming
with us was, I believe,

280
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,955
the first concession
I ever won from my husband.

281
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:08,482
And it won't be the last.
Hold your ground with him, Ellen.

282
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,688
<i>- I've heard nothing but praise.
- Ellen?</i>

283
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:12,754
Would it be terribly
gauche of me

284
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:15,493
to inquire if I might
peek around upstairs?

285
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:18,662
I could get her started, ma'am,
and show her around.

286
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,728
But of course.
Be my guest.

287
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,378
<i>Oh, my dear.</i>

288
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:33,111
If you must turn around,
do it slowly.

289
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,846
Careful.

290
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:37,611
<i>Ellen: I never...</i>

291
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:40,648
And in front of everyone,
no less.

292
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:43,752
Most people think us mad
for being true to our husbands,

293
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,524
and living these lies.

294
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:48,533
But they're not all lies.
Surely, you and Doug...

295
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:53,102
Someday I'll tell you all
of our dirty little secrets.

296
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:56,073
<i>You and I,
we're birds of a feather.</i>

297
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:57,665
<i>Aren't we, dearie?</i>

298
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:00,303
We understand
the virtue of a place

299
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:03,337
in high society...
the power, the luxury.

300
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,375
It's not the king, but the woman
behind the throne.

301
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,148
Isn't it, dear?

302
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:11,178
Sometimes
it feels as if I've...

303
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:12,917
traded my soul.

304
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:55,361
Voice whispering:
Bad.

305
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:58,796
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

306
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:01,635
The music, yes.
It's all the candy, isn't it?

307
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,466
I wonder...

308
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,205
Ellen...

309
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:11,204
don't tell me you're buying
into all that rubbish too.

310
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,274
What kind
of rubbish is that?

311
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,880
You know what
they're saying.

312
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,650
Indian workers.

313
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,250
Some curse.
Sacred grounds.

314
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,987
All that nonsense.

315
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:26,429
The shooting.
That's where it all started.

316
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:57,890
(screaming)

317
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:15,002
John!

318
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,613
Dear friend.

319
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,982
Dear friend, it's all right.
Everything's all right.

320
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:25,119
Calm down.
Calm down.

321
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,487
I know.

322
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:30,126
I know, I know.

323
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:32,061
<i>It's only a little
too much celebration.</i>

324
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:35,123
Let's give her a little privacy,
shall we?

325
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:39,762
You said I could
come look.

326
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:41,135
You said...

327
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,739
What happened?
What was it?

328
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:55,050
(whispering)
I don't want to feel alone here.

329
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:57,316
I don't want
to feel alone.

330
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,582
<i>I know.</i>

331
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:04,653
<i>I know.</i>

332
00:24:38,997 --> 00:24:40,988
<i>Please, John.
Not tonight.</i>

333
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:42,727
I'm exhausted.

334
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:45,292
That woman,
what she said...

335
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:47,304
That old lush?

336
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:49,431
Don't be silly.

337
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:51,635
The party was
a great success.

338
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:54,236
And I have something
so exciting planned.

339
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,610
You'll see.

340
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:57,774
You're drunk.
Please, no.

341
00:24:57,816 --> 00:24:59,545
I've had a fright.

342
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:00,983
The party's over.

343
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,350
No.

344
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,920
That's the idea.

345
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,853
I'd rather not, really.

346
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:13,887
But I have a surprise for you.

347
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,671
I've come to apologize.

348
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:29,002
For Africa.

349
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:31,948
For all my past mistakes.

350
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:35,776
For all your suffering.

351
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,219
John.

352
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:41,248
I beg of you,
please forgive me.

353
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,987
Oh, John.

354
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:45,986
We can start afresh.

355
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,123
Tonight.

356
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,225
Tonight can be our baptism.

357
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:51,997
Say the words.

358
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,560
John.

359
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:55,664
Say the words!

360
00:25:55,707 --> 00:25:57,766
I forgive you.

361
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:00,869
(knocking)

362
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:04,211
You're going to like this.

363
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,234
Thank you.

364
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,048
You do love the unexpected,
don't you?

365
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,126
<i>"I found myself
with child</i>

366
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:33,330
<i>following the night
of the inaugural ball.</i>

367
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:37,206
<i>I'm sure it was then,
because afterward,</i>

368
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,539
<i>John's passions
finally cooled.</i>

369
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:42,444
<i>At least toward me. "</i>

370
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,709
I apologize if you feel
you've been tricked.

371
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,685
Tricked?
However could I feel tricked?

372
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,622
Admittedly, I had expected
a fashionable hotel downtown.

373
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:55,091
But the Rimbauer's
Rose Red for tea?

374
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:57,890
Lmagine my surprise.

375
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:01,689
You're up to no good,
Connie.

376
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,667
And no good
can come of it.

377
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:06,295
<i>- Watch your step, ma'am.
- We mustn't keep Ellen waiting.</i>

378
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,273
And the fevers,
the headaches?

379
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:15,074
You're sweet to ask.

380
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:17,047
Better, I think.

381
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,345
Pity they've kept you in bed
as long as they have.

382
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:26,687
Yes, well...

383
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,191
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

384
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:31,889
<i>I wanted to thank you
Fanny, personally,</i>

385
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:36,025
<i>for having entertained John
as you have these many months.</i>

386
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:40,369
I'm clearly indebted to you.

387
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:41,463
Well...

388
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:44,564
<i>- anything for a friend.
- Yes.</i>

389
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,703
Your service in
that regard was more

390
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:50,009
than any friend
could ask of another.

391
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:56,652
Now that I'm well,
and the baby's nearly here,

392
00:28:56,687 --> 00:29:00,589
John will be spending more time
with his family from now on.

393
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,753
Will he?
Just like that.

394
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:06,025
How marvelous.

395
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:08,328
<i>Yes, I thought it better
something worked out</i>

396
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,425
between those of us
of the fairer sex.

397
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:12,902
Men can be
so unreasonable.

398
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:16,498
Don't ask a man to choose
which mare to ride, Ellen.

399
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,666
He'll always
surprise you.

400
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:23,073
Are you threatening me?

401
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:26,209
What could possibly
make you think that?

402
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:29,879
More tea anyone?

403
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:34,250
<i>Voice, whispering:
Ellen... Ellen...</i>

404
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,123
Did you hear that?

405
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:38,618
Hear what?

406
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:39,891
Fanny?

407
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,035
<i>Ellen:
John! Come quickly!</i>

408
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,537
<i>Preston, Sukeena!</i>

409
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,097
Miss Ellen?

410
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:54,134
Sukeena, check the powder room
for Miss Fauxmanteur, please.

411
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:59,613
<i>And Preston, you take the game room
and the dining room.</i>

412
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,379
<i>- Round up the staff.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

413
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:03,114
<i>Oh, John.
There you are.</i>

414
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:06,955
She's missing... Fanny.
One minute there, then...

415
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:08,982
<i>Oh, don't be silly.
It's nothing.</i>

416
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:10,721
Fanny's full of
all these jokes.

417
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:17,029
I'll organize a thorough search,
but there's nothing to worry about.

418
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:20,929
You sit and rest.
I'll handle this.

419
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:25,901
It's high time we visited
that spiritualist I told you about.

420
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,605
- Madame Lu, she's called.
- John would never hear of it.

421
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,978
A Rimbauer
consult a spiritualist?

422
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:32,573
He'd sooner lock me up.

423
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:34,983
A girl can go shopping,
can't she?

424
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:58,836
<i>You are welcome here again,
Miss Connie.</i>

425
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,935
<i>You bring a friend with child.</i>

426
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:03,879
<i>No greater blessing
to my home.</i>

427
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,974
It is for my friend that I come,
great lady.

428
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:07,382
<i>Indeed,</i>

429
00:31:07,418 --> 00:31:09,978
what question
do you ask of me?

430
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:14,525
How many questions
am I allowed?

431
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,288
I am not a genie.

432
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,262
Speak your mind, child.

433
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:20,889
Very well.

434
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,760
A woman went missing
from our house,

435
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,066
right before our eyes.

436
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:32,405
Is Fanny Fauxmanteur
alive or dead?

437
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:37,109
- This is all?
- Unharmed or in danger?

438
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:39,844
Can we help her?
Does she need our help?

439
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,249
Can you help her?

440
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:59,059
Many forms to life.

441
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:01,162
Isn't that right?

442
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:06,372
This lady's spirit lives.

443
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:10,573
Madame Lu
deals in spirit.

444
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:12,746
Yes?

445
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:15,115
<i>Maybe does not live</i>

446
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:17,814
as you think of living.

447
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,518
And you, my friend?
What say you?

448
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:24,960
<i>The house, Madam,</i>

449
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:28,454
I believe it feels that
Miss Ellen needs her.

450
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,836
<i>Her help, her protection,
I do not know.</i>

451
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,464
<i>But there's a great
presence there, Madam.</i>

452
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:37,940
Untapped powers.

453
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,580
I should like
to meet this house.

454
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:50,243
It is happening.

455
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:51,949
(screaming)

456
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:53,786
Oh, God, did
we lose the child?

457
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:56,224
- There's no choice now.
- You're just going to leave her?

458
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,592
She asked the African
to remain with her.

459
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:01,120
Now the baby's breach.
Buttocks forward.

460
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:03,690
She's not delivering
that child without a scalpel.

461
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,668
Now I need
a few minutes.

462
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,603
And a drink.

463
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:09,230
Can the child be saved?

464
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:11,332
If it's a matter of choosing
between them?

465
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,899
- But it's not.
- But if it were!

466
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:15,707
But it's not.
Now where's that drink?

467
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,476
- (baby crying)
- It's not possible!

468
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,251
It's a boy.

469
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,015
A boy.

470
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:42,962
<i>Voices: Ellen.</i>

471
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:54,543
<i>Ellen.</i>

472
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:32,521
What?

473
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:33,921
Adam?

474
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:41,823
Peaceful and quiet
in his room, Miss Ellen.

475
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:44,562
<i>You had the fevers again.</i>

476
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:47,730
<i>The noise is out
from the hallway.</i>

477
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,075
For his birthday, ma'am.
Do you like it?

478
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:00,379
<i>Perhaps we should
search the grounds.</i>

479
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:02,147
What is the meaning of this?

480
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:04,950
It's Laura, ma'am.
She's disappeared.

481
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:06,183
What?

482
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:12,123
We've got to get me dressed, quickly.
It's happened again.

483
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:15,462
I don't want anyone
jumping to conclusions.

484
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,961
This is a big house,

485
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:21,904
and people don't
just disappear.

486
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,736
<i>Laura will be found.</i>

487
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:31,805
But if not, I'm confident
we'll find an explanation.

488
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:38,587
<i>If anyone has
any information,</i>

489
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:40,249
<i>please say so now.</i>

490
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,851
<i>There will be
no repercussions.</i>

491
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:54,527
Very well then.
You all have your assignments.

492
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:58,074
We'll reassemble
here in...

493
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:01,506
...30 minutes.

494
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,870
Well go.

495
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,178
Gail, isn't it?

496
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,917
Come with me.

497
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:22,190
A moment of your time, please.

498
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:29,270
You can speak to me,
about Laura.

499
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,467
Miss Ellen keeps
her word, Gail.

500
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:34,945
If she says Mr. John will not
hear of it, he will not hear of it.

501
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:39,682
Cook Bollinger sent me
to check on the partridge.

502
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:41,548
Last night this was, late.

503
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,553
<i>I wanted to set it to stew.</i>

504
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:46,317
I saw Laura enter
the butcher's room.

505
00:36:46,357 --> 00:36:48,552
With me own eyes, ma'am.

506
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:51,288
I entered not 20 paces
behind her and yet...

507
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,693
she weren't there.

508
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,096
<i>Weren't in that
butcher's room at all.</i>

509
00:36:58,102 --> 00:37:00,730
<i>I didn't sleep a wink, ma'am.
Not me. Not one wink.</i>

510
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:02,796
I saw her.

511
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,775
You've done fine, Gail.

512
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,039
Not a word of this to anyone.

513
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:22,551
The butcher's room.
Should we go?

514
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:24,720
Not now.

515
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:27,492
No, ma'am.

516
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:29,362
Go, yes, but...

517
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,460
not with everyone
milling about.

518
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:35,199
Later tonight,
when the house is quiet.

519
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,243
(clock bell chiming)

520
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:13,705
<i>Voices: Ellen!</i>

521
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:15,712
What on earth was that?

522
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:19,342
Not of this earth.

523
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,112
No, ma'am.

524
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,591
I've seen enough.

525
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,399
Gail was mistaken,
it's nothing.

526
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:43,099
Gail saw what she saw, ma'am.
She wasn't lying.

527
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,903
You take the wall.

528
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:48,070
There's more to this place
than meets the eye.

529
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:39,054
Sukeena?

530
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:41,424
Sukeena.

531
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:42,932
Sukeena!

532
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:47,068
I found something.

533
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:05,149
This wasn't on the house plans.
But why?

534
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:08,625
So that people can
come and go unseen.

535
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,354
Women.

536
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,561
Ellen: His women.

537
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:18,357
- This man's the devil.
- Uh-huh.

538
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:23,305
Ellen: It feels so much
older down here.

539
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,774
Old as old gets here,
Miss Ellen.

540
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:28,811
We don't know
where it leads.

541
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,076
She needs us.

542
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:34,710
And Rose Red, ma'am.
We're all in this together.

543
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,334
Oh my God.

544
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:35,640
The matches!

545
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:56,727
Help me.

546
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:03,130
Who did this to her?

547
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:18,412
Damn.

548
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:55,248
John: Very nice.

549
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,490
We've lost a fuse.
Fix it, would you?

550
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:00,996
- She'll go with you then?
- Yes.

551
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,492
Wait.

552
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,668
Since when did you
take up smoking, Daniel?

553
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:16,679
What are you talking about?

554
00:43:18,315 --> 00:43:20,613
In the car. Now.
Get her out of here.

555
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:24,447
I'll deal with this.

556
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,484
Man, I will never,
he disgusts me!

557
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:30,823
We have to calm down,
Miss Ellen.

558
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:32,260
It did that to her, didn't he?

559
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:34,890
Did you see the girl
that Daniel was bringing him?

560
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:36,024
A common street girl!

561
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:39,365
The house took Laura to spare
anymore pain. It's for the best.

562
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:41,564
Oh, I don't believe that.
I don't believe any of this.

563
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:43,197
Yes, you do,
Miss Ellen.

564
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,867
I've known.

565
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:47,274
I've known from
the first time I saw you.

566
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:49,302
You are a believer.

567
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:51,678
We must learn
to accept what others

568
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,740
would call
the unexplainable.

569
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:56,616
It is our gift.

570
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:58,814
(floor cracking)

571
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,624
Yes?

572
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:21,707
Been playing
with matches, Ellen?

573
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,110
Ellen: What's that?

574
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:26,378
- Where have you been?
- When?

575
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,213
Now?

576
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:31,584
Here, writing in my diary.
Same as every evening.

577
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:43,165
Right here.
Writing in your diary.

578
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:46,960
How delightfully
innocent of you.

579
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,905
Care to show me
what you've just written?

580
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:56,903
Have a little excerpt
you'd like to share?

581
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,742
John, what is
wrong with you?

582
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:08,146
I heard the car.
Was that you?

583
00:45:08,188 --> 00:45:09,678
Daniel.

584
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:12,283
I had to send him to town
to pick up something.

585
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:15,420
<i>- Business.
- You do work late, husband.</i>

586
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:20,189
Are you going to turn
your back on a woman?

587
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,460
- A woman in need.
- Since when?

588
00:45:24,505 --> 00:45:26,370
It's been months!

589
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:29,675
Seasons change.

590
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,304
Women too.

591
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:38,818
We could play a game.

592
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:40,752
How about this...

593
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:43,052
let me whisper
in your ear.

594
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,027
You...
Little Miss Prim-and-proper.

595
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:55,961
Did you think none?

596
00:45:57,371 --> 00:45:59,271
Oh, my little tart.

597
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:02,742
Look at you.
You wanted it all along.

598
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,201
Lower.

599
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,091
<i>- Sukeena: You must.
- Ellen: No!</i>

600
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:30,103
<i>You must thank
Rose Red.</i>

601
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:32,367
If the lights hadn't failed,
he would have seen us.

602
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:34,601
It's preposterous!
No.

603
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:37,166
- I cannot.
- She's helping us.

604
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,180
You must accept that.
Accept her. Rose Red.

605
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,205
The Chinawoman.

606
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,649
Madame Lu.
She can help.

607
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:46,710
She said she wanted
to meet the house.

608
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:49,654
- Do you think?
- (knocking)

609
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:53,182
Adam is crying.

610
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,354
I can't think
when he's like this.

611
00:46:56,497 --> 00:46:59,261
Sukeena,
would you mind?

612
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,130
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,501
Ellen: Stay.

614
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,637
<i>There's something
we need to discuss.</i>

615
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:16,674
Something we both must do.

616
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,441
Now?

617
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,145
Again?

618
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,248
Shall I lock the door?

619
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,691
Don't.

620
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:30,390
I'm going to find out what
happened to Fanny and Laura.

621
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,888
- A seance.
- Don't be ridiculous.

622
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:38,028
You're a Rimbauer now.
We have standing in this town.

623
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,266
Here.
In Rose Red.

624
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:42,241
Absolutely not.

625
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,801
The staff will talk and
if something like this gets out

626
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:46,642
we'll be the laughing stock
of Seattle.

627
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,581
I'll make the arrangements.
Tonight if possible.

628
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,676
Connie tells me we need
at least two others present.

629
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,846
So I thought,
she and Doug.

630
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,085
Did they put you up to this?

631
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,752
The Poseys?

632
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,694
How dare they interfere
in our affairs!

633
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:06,598
I repeat, put this out
of your thoughts, Ellen.

634
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,828
It is not going to happen.

635
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:10,666
I gave you a son.

636
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:11,966
An heir.

637
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:15,270
You will give me this seance
and you will attend.

638
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:18,739
Or else?

639
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,907
Or, my door will be
locked to you.

640
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:26,352
And Adam will be
our first and last.

641
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:38,562
<i>Gail has asked for us
to meet her downstairs, ma'am.</i>

642
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:40,829
In the basement?

643
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:43,335
No, downstairs
in the butler's hallway.

644
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,338
She's found something
she thinks you should see.

645
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,940
It just popped open, ma'am.
All of its own.

646
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:51,069
I weren't looking for it
or nothing.

647
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:53,671
- You saw something?
- Something awful, ma'am.

648
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:56,444
Right above
the table it is.

649
00:48:56,483 --> 00:48:58,280
You'll see.

650
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,386
<i>- It's John's study.
- Ma'am?</i>

651
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,591
Surprising, yes.
But hardly awful.

652
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,927
Tell us what
you saw, Gail.

653
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:23,571
It weren't like nothing
I've ever seen.

654
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,544
Waile on water it was.

655
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:27,740
Like heat rising
from a fire.

656
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:31,212
It moved.

657
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,549
Like a shadow,
but nothing was there.

658
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,352
Very well.
You may go now, Gail. Thank you.

659
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,884
- You did right.
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

660
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:49,931
John's study.

661
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,700
No wonder why the oil business
is doing so well.

662
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,708
He's been spying
on his associates.

663
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,801
Sukeena: Mmm-mm.

664
00:49:57,844 --> 00:49:59,937
Them and who else,
Miss Ellen?

665
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:03,309
That girl Gail
saw something.

666
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,545
Someone.

667
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,519
Rose Red.

668
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:10,489
She wanted us
to find this.

669
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,956
Why?

670
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:16,220
It's time we know.

671
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:19,958
Join hands, please.

672
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,174
Great house that now
surrounds us...

673
00:50:33,213 --> 00:50:35,511
open your door.

674
00:50:37,517 --> 00:50:40,077
I'm inside.

675
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:44,223
Women. Pain.

676
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:47,216
<i>Anger.</i>

677
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,128
<i>You are not alone,
my child.</i>

678
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:58,837
<i>I am here with you.</i>

679
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:02,264
<i>Sit down.</i>

680
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,571
Sin is where it started.

681
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:11,514
Atonement at the top.

682
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,951
Build me to the heavens.

683
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,683
And life never stops.

684
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:18,953
Build the house.
Is that it?

685
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,290
Actually the house is
quite complete, thank you.

686
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,888
(chuckles)

687
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:32,666
Build me to the heavens
and life never stops.

688
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:34,139
Join me.

689
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:51,484
Build me to the heavens
and life never stops.

690
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:58,587
Really this is quite enough.
Stop it, I say.

691
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,964
There will be no more
sin in this house.

692
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:03,697
Enough I say.

693
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:05,830
Thank you, Rose Red.

694
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,568
I'll be damned if I have to put up
with this in my own house.

695
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:10,542
You're damned already, sir.

696
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:12,875
Your damnations feed her.

697
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,409
I will never stop building you.

698
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:30,554
Good evening, Gail.

699
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:32,861
Good evening, sir.

700
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:45,209
Yes?

701
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,213
It's Gail, sir.

702
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,238
Gail, is that supposed
to mean something to me?

703
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,614
We're taking breakfast,
Mrs. Abernathy.

704
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:56,319
What about Gail?

705
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,415
<i>She's gone missing, ma'am.</i>

706
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,925
No one's seen her
since late last night.

707
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,923
Should I have Preston
telephone the police, ma'am?

708
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,995
Leave us, please,
Mrs. Abernathy.

709
00:53:12,305 --> 00:53:15,900
How many more go missing
before we involve the police, John?

710
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,002
The question you have
to ask yourself, Ellen, is...

711
00:53:19,045 --> 00:53:21,605
who's gonna pay for
this construction of yours?

712
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,745
You can't do it
without me.

713
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,480
We both need
each other.

714
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:31,516
You never get them
for a second time.

715
00:53:33,226 --> 00:53:34,784
The house won't
give you that.

716
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:37,524
You could have prevented
this last night.

717
00:53:37,564 --> 00:53:40,055
The choice was
clearly yours.

718
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,830
<i>- So it's my fault?
- This is your house now, Ellen.</i>

719
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:44,200
Not mine.

720
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:47,536
That is, if you have me
to pay for it, of course.

721
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,533
My house.

722
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,836
It is, isn't it?

723
00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:56,941
You're right about that.

724
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,474
So I'd tread lightly
if I were you, John.

725
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:01,783
One never knows
who's next.

726
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:06,921
Is that supposed
to scare me?

727
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,656
The house is going
to snatch me up?

728
00:54:10,897 --> 00:54:13,388
You do try so very hard,
don't you?

729
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:17,198
- Preston?
- Ma'am?

730
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:20,172
Round up the servants.
We'll conduct a search.

731
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:24,203
No need to involve
the police.

732
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:30,539
<i>"Our daughter April has come.</i>

733
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,982
<i>Her birth was easier
than Adam's,</i>

734
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,112
<i>but her arm,
her poor arm.</i>

735
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:36,713
<i>I blame John.</i>

736
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,748
<i>My husband has
a great deal to answer for. "</i>

737
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:43,593
Adam says his friends won't come over
because my arm scares them.

738
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,461
- Do not!
- Do too!

739
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:47,466
Mother, it's not true.

740
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,627
You are God's
special creature.

741
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:51,330
Don't think otherwise.

742
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,738
Adam, there is enough
cruelty in this world

743
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:56,742
without bringing it
upon each other.

744
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:58,437
Be good to your sister.

745
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:00,537
Now.
Off and ready for bed.

746
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:07,920
Adam, give that back.
It's mine.

747
00:55:09,856 --> 00:55:11,881
The boy is starting
to think like his father.

748
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,321
He'll be ignoring her too,
pretty soon.

749
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:16,624
I'll not have it.

750
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:19,632
One John Rimbauer
in the family is enough.

751
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:36,748
<i>"Sometimes the construction
continues far into the night.</i>

752
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:40,412
<i>- I find the sound soothing... "
- (clunk)</i>

753
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:48,293
- Connie?
- We must talk.

754
00:55:53,466 --> 00:55:55,331
The worst has happened.

755
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:58,360
I once cautioned you that Douglas
and I had our secrets as well.

756
00:55:58,405 --> 00:56:00,532
Well the time has come
for me to share them.

757
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,734
That is, if time has not
already run out.

758
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,505
I've never seen you
so distraught.

759
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:06,603
If only I could be a fly on the wall
of that discussion.

760
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:10,013
Truly?
Perhaps I can help.

761
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:18,046
Sign it.

762
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:23,222
<i>Can't a man
make a mistake?</i>

763
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:26,027
He can, and you have.

764
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,864
But what kind of a man
you are, I really can't say.

765
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:32,269
<i>Doug:
It won't happen again.</i>

766
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:35,840
<i>John: A clerk in
the filing room.</i>

767
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,967
<i>You disgust me.</i>

768
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:41,139
The sailors at the dock at night,

769
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:44,639
as repugnant as I found that,
I could overlook it.

770
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:46,515
But in the company offices?

771
00:56:46,553 --> 00:56:48,544
With an employee?

772
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:50,556
You leave me no choice.

773
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,057
Sign it.

774
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:57,186
A second chance is all.

775
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:00,393
A posting in Europe, perhaps.

776
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,401
The North Pole
for God's sake, please.

777
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:06,932
I need this.

778
00:57:06,973 --> 00:57:09,032
<i>You should have
thought of that.</i>

779
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,475
Of the position
you put me in.

780
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:15,539
The company cannot
entertain scandal.

781
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:19,348
If not for me, then for Connie,
for God's sake, John.

782
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:21,376
A month or two and we're...

783
00:57:21,421 --> 00:57:23,355
destitute.

784
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:28,587
Not my problem.

785
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,221
<i>I want you
out of this house.</i>

786
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:33,926
<i>You're not to visit.</i>

787
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:38,566
And you are never
to see my son again.

788
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:49,343
How dare you
imply such a thing?

789
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,407
You monster.

790
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:52,440
Me?

791
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:54,282
You have ruined
everything.

792
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,446
And for what?

793
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:58,048
<i>A few moments
of selfish pleasure?</i>

794
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:01,356
As easily said into a mirror,
John Rimbauer.

795
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,954
Sign it and leave it
on my desk.

796
00:58:03,997 --> 00:58:05,931
Or everyone will know.

797
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:17,338
May you rot in hell.

798
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,404
Don't fool yourself,
Posey.

799
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:24,814
You'll be there
long before I am.

800
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,488
Connie: You must
intervene on my behalf.

801
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,047
Are the accusations true?

802
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,991
A marriage of convenience.
I told you as much.

803
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:36,928
- But, Connie, Doug...
- Are you to cast the first stone?

804
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:39,898
No, no. Of course not.
You're right.

805
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,128
Something must be done.

806
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:44,602
Doug has squandered
his earnings trying to maintain

807
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:47,037
a lifestyle to which he thinks
I've grown accustomed.

808
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:49,803
He's right. A month or two.
Three at the most.

809
00:58:49,843 --> 00:58:52,676
The debts are enormous.
You must speak to John.

810
00:58:52,712 --> 00:58:54,703
Charm him?

811
00:58:54,747 --> 00:58:56,977
- Did you see him?
- Doug?

812
00:58:57,016 --> 00:58:58,984
No, John.

813
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:00,849
It's begun.

814
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:03,651
The decent into madness.
It's the disease, you see.

815
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,181
It cures in women
but it festers in men.

816
00:59:06,226 --> 00:59:08,694
Festers and
eats the mind.

817
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:10,787
You must speak to him.
I beg you.

818
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:14,357
We should console Doug.
What a state he must be in.

819
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,950
He needs a minute
to compose himself.

820
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,980
After that he'll look
for the children,

821
00:59:38,024 --> 00:59:39,548
to say goodbye.

822
00:59:39,592 --> 00:59:42,390
He loves them so.

823
00:59:43,396 --> 00:59:46,627
What John said...
it was so hurtful.

824
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,735
Daddy?

825
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,174
Adam:
It's Uncle Doug.

826
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,940
Oh, children.

827
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:02,573
What are you
doing awake?

828
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:04,708
It is past your bedtime.

829
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:07,185
But we want to play
with you, Uncle Doug.

830
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,687
Please?

831
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:09,847
Oh, uh...

832
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:14,258
Okay.

833
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,558
Here's what
we're gonna do.

834
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:26,231
We are going to play a game
of hide and seek.

835
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:27,603
Okay?

836
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,505
Now, I will count to 10,

837
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,238
and you two
run and hide.

838
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:35,509
But first you gotta
give me a big hug.

839
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,708
Okay?

840
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:41,015
Okay.

841
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,817
Go hide.
Quick.

842
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,220
<i>Come on, Adam.
Let's go hide.</i>

843
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:54,394
One...

844
01:00:56,502 --> 01:00:58,026
two...

845
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:03,040
three...

846
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:43,278
10 days you say?

847
01:01:43,316 --> 01:01:46,513
Not one word spoken.
Other than when she's asleep.

848
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:48,645
I keep hoping,
but nothing.

849
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:50,815
She talks in her sleep?

850
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:53,985
- Please explain.
- Just his name.

851
01:01:54,027 --> 01:01:55,995
Uncle Doug.
Over and over.

852
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:59,590
The house.
Is anything different?

853
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,634
Have you heard voices?

854
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:05,432
Doors shut?
Wind?

855
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,996
The house is much colder
since the hanging.

856
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:10,168
Your son,
fine you said?

857
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:12,473
His father sent him
away to school.

858
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:14,605
Just like that.

859
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:20,548
I will see her now.

860
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,781
So, this is April.

861
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:28,586
Pretty child.

862
01:02:28,628 --> 01:02:30,653
Pretty mother.

863
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,495
Come, April.

864
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:35,330
Sit with Mamma Lu.

865
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:45,901
You saw a man
take his own life?

866
01:02:48,281 --> 01:02:51,512
<i>You have not
spoken since then.</i>

867
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:56,181
Mamma Lu thinks you are
a smart girl, little April.

868
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,383
You do not speak
because

869
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:02,394
your question
is not yet answered.

870
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:05,729
Is Mamma Lu right?

871
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:09,201
What question? I've tried
to explain it to her in a dozen ways.

872
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:10,759
The question is this...

873
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:16,207
if he can hear you without
your talking, why can't they?

874
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:19,234
<i>You think maybe
they love you less.</i>

875
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:21,303
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

876
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:27,215
Maybe, they do not
listen as hard,

877
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:29,585
do not listen
the right way.

878
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:33,251
Maybe something's
wrong with them

879
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,385
if they don't hear him.

880
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,295
You are not suggesting...

881
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:42,427
You see?
She would never believe me.

882
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:50,273
She would
if you only told her.

883
01:03:51,711 --> 01:03:53,804
Dark lady believes.

884
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:57,448
Mamma Lu believes, too.

885
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:01,380
Go on.

886
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,513
Tell her.

887
01:04:03,556 --> 01:04:07,117
Uncle Doug and I,
we talk in our heads.

888
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,153
You mean, you play
with each other as well?

889
01:04:11,197 --> 01:04:13,427
He loves it here.

890
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,559
He built Rose Red.

891
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,332
Did he tell you that too?

892
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:22,136
She said you built her,
Mamma.

893
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:23,699
Did she?

894
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:26,211
She says,
she loves Mamma.

895
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:29,214
As much as I do.
Maybe more.

896
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:34,045
Thank you.
Thank you, great lady.

897
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:36,054
Mother will
stay with child.

898
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:41,388
Dark lady will show
old friend to taxi.

899
01:04:48,234 --> 01:04:50,395
I didn't want her
to hear us.

900
01:04:50,436 --> 01:04:52,370
- April?
- No.

901
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:55,340
The house. I do not want
the house to hear us.

902
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:57,274
- She grows stronger.
- Yes.

903
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,107
I felt this too.

904
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,272
What she said
about the house, Ellen...

905
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,839
When love goes bad,
it goes very bad.

906
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:07,182
Miss Ellen spends too much time
with her daughter of late.

907
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,314
I think the house
is jealous or angry,

908
01:05:10,356 --> 01:05:14,190
using Uncle Doug
to influence the little one.

909
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:18,094
You need to leave.
All three of you.

910
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,530
Is it safe to leave?

911
01:05:20,566 --> 01:05:23,467
She will use child
to reach mother.

912
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,993
Very bad for mother.
Bad sign.

913
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:27,733
You leave tomorrow,

914
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:29,502
next day, the latest.

915
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:35,838
Do not tell Ellen.

916
01:05:35,881 --> 01:05:37,872
But I must tell...

917
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:44,583
The house hears
Ellen's every thought.

918
01:05:44,624 --> 01:05:48,355
If the house finds out
she plans to leave...

919
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:51,727
You must not tell her.

920
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:54,631
Come.

921
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:03,065
(voices whispering)

922
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:18,856
<i>"I finally discovered something
more important than Rose Red.</i>

923
01:06:24,363 --> 01:06:27,093
<i>April means
everything to me.</i>

924
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:30,569
<i>How could I have become
so focused on the house?"</i>

925
01:07:28,694 --> 01:07:30,161
(April laughing)

926
01:08:30,389 --> 01:08:32,482
April! April!

927
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:37,425
April!

928
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:39,728
No!

929
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,368
She was right there.

930
01:08:46,405 --> 01:08:47,770
Playing.

931
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:51,140
I... should have...

932
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,807
What's this?

933
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,442
There she is.

934
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:02,176
Release her.

935
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,553
- It's only a formality.
- So ask your questions.

936
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,990
- Downtown.
- She certainly will not go downtown.

937
01:09:07,026 --> 01:09:09,324
This is all your doing, isn't it?
You never liked her.

938
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:11,522
- Ellen!
- Ask him about the others.

939
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,895
- Others?
- Do your job.

940
01:09:12,932 --> 01:09:15,196
She did this
to keep you here.

941
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,826
She know
you won't leave now.

942
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,632
Not ever.
Not without April.

943
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:21,601
Leave me alone!

944
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:25,535
You will pay for this!

945
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,937
We'll see.

946
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,111
Ellen, dear.

947
01:10:07,152 --> 01:10:09,416
Good to see you
up and about.

948
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:12,590
Two days, John.

949
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,923
It's been two days.

950
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,695
I miss her too, dear.

951
01:10:19,732 --> 01:10:21,461
Sukeena, John.

952
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,434
Not April.

953
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,697
Nothing could bring April...

954
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,673
Not yet.

955
01:10:33,412 --> 01:10:35,676
I want things
back to normal.

956
01:10:37,283 --> 01:10:40,150
Yes, well, we all want things
back to normal, don't we?

957
01:10:43,923 --> 01:10:46,824
But that requires
certain sacrifices.

958
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:48,986
For all of us.

959
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:51,189
<i>Don't you think?</i>

960
01:12:06,805 --> 01:12:08,602
I want her back.

961
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:40,297
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

962
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,219
Sukeena?

963
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:12,031
Come, come.

964
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,616
Rest easy.

965
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:31,680
It's my turn to take
care of you now.

966
01:13:31,724 --> 01:13:33,988
Long overdue.

967
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:38,590
Any sign of her?

968
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:43,364
(door opens)

969
01:13:48,207 --> 01:13:49,902
Not tonight, John.

970
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:06,387
We have a deal,
you and I.

971
01:14:06,425 --> 01:14:08,154
Not tonight, John.

972
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,184
She'll be stronger
in a day or two.

973
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,390
There is another way
to do this, of course.

974
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,765
Remember Africa?

975
01:14:21,774 --> 01:14:24,106
She doesn't even need
to get out of bed at all.

976
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:27,877
Out.

977
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,539
We have a deal.

978
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,608
The deal is over.

979
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:35,620
I'd like my key back.

980
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:47,494
She better gain
her strength quickly.

981
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,867
In one week I want her
out of this house.

982
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:54,862
That is absurd.
You cannot.

983
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,273
Yes I can.

984
01:14:57,309 --> 01:15:00,574
She will never set foot
in this house again.

985
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:15,483
If she is not gone
within a week,

986
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:17,392
construction will stop.

987
01:15:29,508 --> 01:15:31,499
Don't worry, my friend.

988
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:34,341
He won't remember
any of this tomorrow.

989
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,486
Sawdust?

990
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,294
(voice whispering)

991
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,806
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

992
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:08,142
<i>I heard it too.</i>

993
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:11,877
<i>- What does she...
- The tower, Miss Ellen.</i>

994
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,052
She wants you
to build her a tower.

995
01:16:18,257 --> 01:16:20,248
<i>"Even though
it's unfinished,</i>

996
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:22,658
<i>the Rose Tower
whispers April's name.</i>

997
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:26,391
<i>Sukeena's right. If she is to be
found anywhere, it will be there.</i>

998
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:29,525
<i>The workers have made
record time in its construction.</i>

999
01:16:29,568 --> 01:16:32,230
<i>Jack Finney even
said to me... "</i>

1000
01:16:32,271 --> 01:16:34,501
It's almost as if Rose Red
built it herself.

1001
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:37,007
We'll have it ready
for you within days.

1002
01:16:37,042 --> 01:16:39,169
Well ahead of schedule,
don't you worry.

1003
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:41,304
No you won't.

1004
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,550
- I want everybody out.
- What?

1005
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:51,556
All construction is to stop
immediately, Jack.

1006
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,251
<i>Including the tower.</i>

1007
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:55,453
And I'm locking the attic.

1008
01:16:55,494 --> 01:16:57,689
<i>Our deal has
fallen through.</i>

1009
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:00,990
Okay, men.
Pack it up.

1010
01:17:04,803 --> 01:17:06,566
Do not do this to me.

1011
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:08,766
You did this
all by yourself.

1012
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:11,401
<i>I want her out
of this house.</i>

1013
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:12,933
You can't be serious.

1014
01:17:12,978 --> 01:17:14,707
You want Jack
back on the job?

1015
01:17:14,746 --> 01:17:17,476
Then do something
about it.

1016
01:17:39,705 --> 01:17:42,469
(clock bell chimes)

1017
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:50,341
<i>"Today, John and I
are at a stalemate.</i>

1018
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:54,318
<i>The most frightening thing
is that he's no longer sane.</i>

1019
01:17:55,487 --> 01:17:57,853
<i>I have to stop him, but...</i>

1020
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:00,414
<i>I'm out of ideas. "</i>

1021
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,188
(April laughing)

1022
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:08,826
Miss Ellen?

1023
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,262
I hear it.

1024
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,246
April?

1025
01:19:09,127 --> 01:19:11,254
The tower.

1026
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:31,006
April?

1027
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,845
April, dear.
Are you here?

1028
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,878
I miss you, sweet girl.

1029
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,881
Tell her more, ma'am.
She needs to hear it.

1030
01:19:41,893 --> 01:19:43,485
I love you.

1031
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,562
I love you, Mamma.

1032
01:20:00,979 --> 01:20:03,174
"Atonement at the top. "

1033
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,240
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1034
01:20:07,252 --> 01:20:09,345
He cannot lock me
out of here.

1035
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:12,756
It is time.

1036
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,354
<i>It is time.</i>

1037
01:20:46,224 --> 01:20:48,124
<i>"I write now out of desperation.</i>

1038
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,687
<i>I feel danger everywhere
around Sukeena and me.</i>

1039
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:55,496
<i>Now I understand what I couldn't
know seven years ago,</i>

1040
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:58,094
<i>what I wasn't
ready to know.</i>

1041
01:20:58,136 --> 01:21:01,401
<i>My mother's heart knows
what must be done,</i>

1042
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,671
<i>while the heart of the woman,
the wife, beats in terror. "</i>

1043
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,848
Sorry to trouble you,
Mr. John.

1044
01:21:14,853 --> 01:21:16,616
What do you want?

1045
01:21:17,856 --> 01:21:20,882
I've come to ask you
for a favor, sir...

1046
01:21:23,728 --> 01:21:27,027
not meaning
to waste your time.

1047
01:21:27,065 --> 01:21:29,090
Well, you are
wasting my time.

1048
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,602
Get on with it, girl.
Or get out.

1049
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,467
I'd hoped...

1050
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:36,936
Well, you're
a businessman, sir.

1051
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,704
And I'm a practical woman.

1052
01:21:38,743 --> 01:21:41,712
When one deal is lost,

1053
01:21:41,746 --> 01:21:44,271
sometimes, another
deal can be made.

1054
01:21:46,885 --> 01:21:48,853
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

1055
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:50,821
Perhaps I misjudged.

1056
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:55,383
Wait.

1057
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,395
Make your point.

1058
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:11,776
Seeing how...

1059
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:14,472
warm and moist
it is this evening and,

1060
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,505
how my room lack
much of a window...

1061
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,382
well, I won't be here
much longer, will I?

1062
01:22:34,966 --> 01:22:37,025
What are you up to?

1063
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:39,400
I was thinking...

1064
01:22:39,437 --> 01:22:42,338
about the tower, sir.

1065
01:22:44,242 --> 01:22:48,110
And how the breeze
must blow fine up there.

1066
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:49,909
A night like this?

1067
01:22:49,948 --> 01:22:51,882
It being locked up and all.

1068
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:55,709
No one's allowed up
in the attic, are they?

1069
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:01,088
<i>We could have it all
to ourselves.</i>

1070
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,327
Miss Ellen need not
know of it.

1071
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:12,701
She need not know anything
about this evening, Mr. John.

1072
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,580
Take it.

1073
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,780
(voices whispering)

1074
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:28,773
<i>Remember Africa, sir?</i>

1075
01:24:35,353 --> 01:24:38,789
<i>Tonight, you'll get
what you really deserve.</i>

1076
01:24:45,296 --> 01:24:47,059
We can play a game.

1077
01:24:47,098 --> 01:24:48,725
How about this...

1078
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:50,894
let me whisper in your ear.

1079
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:56,196
Are you ready for this?

1080
01:24:59,944 --> 01:25:01,878
John:
We have a deal.

1081
01:25:09,487 --> 01:25:10,977
<i>April's voice: Daddy?</i>

1082
01:25:13,658 --> 01:25:15,489
<i>Don't ask a man to choose...</i>

1083
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:16,516
<i>Help me...</i>

1084
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:19,325
<i>As easily said into a mirror,
John Rimbauer...</i>

1085
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:24,258
<i>There will be no more
sin in this house...</i>

1086
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:40,176
He jumped, of course,
while we slept.

1087
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,947
<i>Of course.</i>

1088
01:25:41,986 --> 01:25:44,511
Driven mad by the drink,
I suppose.

1089
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:48,014
<i>I suppose,
or the disease.</i>

1090
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:49,583
You'll send for the police.

1091
01:25:49,627 --> 01:25:52,221
My duty as the new
head of household.

1092
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:55,591
And send for Adam, too.

1093
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,267
It's Mr. Rimbauer!

1094
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,441
What happened?

1095
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:21,448
Will we be taking
our breakfast here, Ellen?

1096
01:26:26,231 --> 01:26:28,028
Heavens no.

1097
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:29,931
The tower.

1098
01:26:37,976 --> 01:26:40,877
And then there's
the construction to oversee.

1099
01:26:40,912 --> 01:26:42,937
<i>Jack Finney will wish
he lived here himself</i>

1100
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:44,846
<i>by the time
I'm through.</i>

1101
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,844
I can change
anything I want.

1102
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:51,355
And the tower it is.

1103
01:26:52,423 --> 01:26:54,687
Oh, yes.

1104
01:26:54,726 --> 01:26:57,286
We have a lot of catching up to do,
my daughter and I.

1105
01:27:10,542 --> 01:27:13,375
(voices whispering)
