537
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
[Karl] Move it.

538
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Sit down. Sit your ass down.

539
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
Hey! Where... where are you going? Stop!

540
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Hey! Stop, I said!

541
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840

[squelching, crackling]

549
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,080
Already?

550
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
[eerie music playing]

551
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,680

552
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,400
[hijacker 2] <i>Jurij, come in.</i>

553
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
<i>Is the jump prepped?</i>

554
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,040
Jurij, come in. Do you read me?

555
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,360
<i>Ten minutes to jump.
What's the status of the charge?</i>

556
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,800
<i>Jurij, you Czech bastard. Do you hear me?</i>

557
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,320
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

558
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,760

[barking]

567
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,240
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time
for us to say goodbye to you now.

568
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,160
For our own safety and protection,
we booby-trapped this plane.

569
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,120
If anyone should rush forward
or try to follow us,

570
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,840
a toxic nerve gas will be released.

571
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
In that case, please use your gas masks.

572
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,680
Just put it slightly over your nose
and breathe normal.

573
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,680
Oh, sorry, that's right.
You don't have any gas masks.

574
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,240
[laughing]

575
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,480
So, please observe the fasten
seat belt signs above your heads,

576
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,280
and remain seated
for the rest of the flight.

577
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,040
We realize that you have
a choice of airlines

578
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,240
and would like to thank you
for flying with Transatlantic tonight.

579
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,600
Good night. Sleep tight.

580
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,760
Nice flight.

581
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,800
- Hair spray cans?
- [hijacker 2 laughs]

582
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,480
Nice try.

583
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,680
[Hightower] Fake it 'til you make it.

584
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,560
- Put your mask on.
- [Karl] There's no need for it.

585
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
[speaking indistinctly]

586
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Jurij!

587
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,360
Where the fuck are you?

588
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Oh whoa.

589
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh wow.

590
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,280
What the hell happened to you?

591
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,600
[whining]

592
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,360

594
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,640
Elias! Elias!

595
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,320
Mama. Mama. Mama.

596
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,320
You can't do that. You can't do that.

597
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,480
Go back to your seats!

598
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Okay.

599
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,040
- I thought you were dead.
- Everything is fine, honey.

600
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,600
We have to turn the plane around,
then everything will be fine.

601
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,880
Go, go.

602
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,200
Don't... Don't look over there.

603
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't look.

604
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Fuck.

605
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
[bleeping]

606
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,080
Forty-three miles to target area.

607
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,560
[mom] Where is the pilot?

608
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,880
The pilot, where is he?

609
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,720
[speaking indistinctly]

610
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,160
The pilot is dead.

611
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,720
[passengers gasping]

612
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,280
[speaking indistinctly]

613
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
[mom] Okay.

614
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,080
Does anyone... Does anyone on board
know how to fly a plane?

615
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,240
[shouting]
Is there anyone here who knows how to fly?

616
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,640
Answer me!

617
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,040
Is there anyone who knows
how to fly a fucking plane?

618
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,080
- [Rainer] What are you doing?
- I'm an aerospace engineering student.

619
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,960
Sit down! They'll kill all of us.

620
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,800
We're gonna die anyway.

621
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,160
[woman] What? What are you talking about?

622
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,640
An Arab student with flight experience
fits the profile perfectly.

623
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,360
Brother, why New York?

624
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,240
- I'm going to a convention.
- Move.

625
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,880
- [Farid] Me too.
- Come on. Come on.

626
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,200
They set us up.
They made us read a statement

627
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,760
saying we wanted
to crash the airplane in London.

628
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,640
Either we die
or the British shoot us down.

629
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,520
- Nonsense. They're not terrorists.
- Oh yeah?

630
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,080
Why? Because they don't have beards
and pray towards Mecca?

631
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
They want to influence the stock market.

632
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,560
The market's overheated.

633
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,040
When another 9/11 happens,
prices will tank.

634
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,840
You could make billions from shorting.

635
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
He thinks
they wanna crash the stock market.

636
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,880
Like that bombing a few years ago.
The soccer club.

637
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,720
They want to change
the outcome of the election.

638
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,440
Whatever. If we don't do anything,
we're gonna die. That's for sure.

639
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,240
We have to do something now.

640
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,400
Just before the election.
Remember Madrid 2004?

641
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,000
[suspenseful music playing]

642
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,760
I've spent a few hours
on a flight simulator, but I...

643
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,840
Hey...

644
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,160
T-minus ten minutes to drop zone,
awaiting go.

645
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,040
- [man] <i>We're on position.</i>
- Got it.

646
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,520
[Karl] Who are those guys down there?

647
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,000
- I don't want to end up as shark bait.
- Make sure you have your GPS on.

648
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,880
[Karl] Who's going to get his mil?

649
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,440
[mom] It'll be all right. I promise.

650
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Hey.

651
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,360
[Elias] Did you drink blood?

652
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,840
You have to take your medicine.

653
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,560
Hey, everything okay in there?

654
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,040
That wasn't me.

655
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,440
[rattling]

656
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,560
They've got the autopilot on.

657
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
[mom] Don't.

658
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,200
Let them jump first.

659
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,960
She's alive.

660
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
[passengers speaking indistinctly]

661
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,960
[hijacker 2] Where is she?

662
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,160
They're in the cockpit.

663
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,480
No, wait!

664
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,040
- [Hightower] Get the fuck back to economy.
- Shit.

665
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Shit.

666
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,520
Open the door!

667
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,600
- Turn the plane around.
- [student] What?

668
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,400
I said turn the plane around!

669
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,880
[student] We're closer
to Europe right now.

670
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,760
[beeping]

671
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
Shit!

672
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,880
[grunts]

673
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,040
Open the door!

674
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,760
[Mom growls]

675
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,960
[growling] Turn around! Now!

676
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,400
[breathing heavily]

677
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,600
They're turning.

678
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
- One!
- No, please don't!

679
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,600
<i>- Please don't!
- Two!</i>

680
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,200
<i>Three!</i>

681
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,320
[firing]

682
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,080
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

683
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,160
[weeps]

684
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,840
[hijacker 2] We got 200 more passengers
on this plane.

685
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
We can play this game all night long.

686
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,840
Give me another one.

687
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,200
What the fuck you looking at? Go!

688
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,560
[gasps] No! Please, don't. Please, don't.

689
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,520
- I'm begging you, please.
- No!

690
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,840
[crying]

691
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,160
[Karl] Stop it, you psycho!
What the fuck are you doing?

692
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,680
Put the fucking knife away,
or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head.

693
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,400
[hijacker 2] Why is this taking so long?
Get me another passenger.

694
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,160
Sit down. Sit back. Put your hands up.

695
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
[wailing] No!

696
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,120
- [Karl] Put your hands up!
- [woman] No!

697
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,720
What?

698
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,960
[woman] No!

699

- [girl crying]
- [phone rings]

700
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,520
- [man] <i>Where the fuck are you?
- </i>Delayed. Will transmit new coordinates.

701
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,880
Fuck!

702
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,680
All these deaths,

703
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,520
they're on your hands.

704
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,640
[girl crying]

705
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Sweetheart.

706
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
It's okay.

707
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,600
Do you wanna see
who drives the plane? Come on.

708
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,800

He bit me.

But you do?

802
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,040
No one does. The evil is too strong.

Isn't that enough?

Get a fucking grip.
What's the matter with you?

01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,640
Okay, okay.

1081
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,000
Stay here.

1082
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,520
[gasps] Oh my God.
Elias! Elias! Get some help, quick!

1083
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
Quick!

1084

[snarls]

1086
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,680
[Elias] Help me!

1087
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,200
We need heavy people
to weigh down the hatch!

1088
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,680
What did he say?

1089
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,080
What do you want?

1090
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,280
[growls]

1091
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,320
Help me! Help!

1092
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,720

Help! help! Fuck!

1098
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,080
[Elias] No!

1099
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,640
Stop! Don't bite him!

1100
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,680
Stop! Go away! Don't drink his blood!

1101
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,160
What the fuck?

1102
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,320
[Nadja] Elias.

1103
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,040
Elias, get back. He's dangerous.

1104
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,320
He wants to be healed, just like you!

1105
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,760
[growls]

1106
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,240
- Don't!
- Keep calm, Elias!

1107
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
Right here.

1108
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,440
[roaring]

1109
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,520
[Farid moans]

1110
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,560
My hand got caught in the cargo hold door.

1111
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,800
And your mom helped me.

1112
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,120
Come.

1113
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,640
Elias. Let's go.

1114
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,320
We need a doctor.

1115
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,760
We need a doctor!

1116
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,240
I'm a doctor!

1117
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,520
[clamoring]

1118
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,040
No, it's not about me.
There's a guy in the rear who's worse off.

1119
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,320
[passengers shouting]

1120
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,520
[Farid] Don't worry. She's on our side!

01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,600
[passengers screaming]

1122
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,720
We got everything under control!
Don't worry!

[grunts]

1124
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,280
[Nadja] Turn the plane around.

1125
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,200
- Do it!
- I have to check our course.

1126
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,120
- We're below cruising altitude.
- Mom.

1127
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,040
- Mom.
- What's going on?

1128
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,120
She wants us to fly to New York.
But we're too low and short on fuel.

1129
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,120
We have to divert to the nearest airport,
or we'll crash into the ocean.

1130
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,320
- Turn the plane!
- Hey, we can't make it to New York.

1131
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,400
Do you understand?

1132
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,440
You got to help me.

1133
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,240
Please, help me. I'll pay you.

1134
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,840
Don't worry. I'll help you.

[groans in pain]

1136
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,920
[Elias] It's dark down there.

1137
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,160
Come on. Let's go.

1138
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,400
[Bastian] This is Transatlantic 473.

1139
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,160
Do you read me?

1140
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,720
Transatlantic 473.

1141
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,000
Anybody read me?

1142
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,560
They wanted to blow down the door.

1143
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,880
Watch out, it's on!

1144
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,560
Not anymore.

1145
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,560
It's gonna be fine. We'll wait until dark
and catch the next plane to New York.

1146
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,640
Mom, look how far we've come.

1147
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,440
Mom!

1148
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,480
Please, we can do it.

1151
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,920
Thank you.

1152
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,960
Thank you, guys.

1153
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,400
If the pain gets worse,
take two more pills.

1154
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,240
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay. I take care of the broker.

1155
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,160
How is he?

1156
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,520
He has massive interior bleeding.

I am the second officer.
My name is Bastian Buchner.

1164
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,040
We have been hijacked.

[controller] <i>Are you in danger?</i>

1168
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,960
Negative. We overpowered the hijackers,
and we locked them in the cargo hold.

1169
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,840
I'm so cold.

1170
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,560
You've got a kidney rupture.
I can't stop the bleeding.

1171
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,120
What does this mean?

1172
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,000
- I'll get you something for the pain.
- Stay here.

You've got to help me.

1174

I'll pay you.

1175
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,400
A million dollars.

1176
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,560
Your money isn't going
to help you now either.

1177
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,720
I'm sorry.

1178
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,680
She'll be right back.

Goodbye.

1200

Dr. Brown will make sure
to get the Cytarabine.

1201

That way we'll have enough time

Hey, what are you doing?

1212
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,760
We can help them!
We can hide them down there!

1213
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,360
If we open the door,
then we'll never get it shut again.

1214
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,440
Fuck!

[Julia] Please, we're gonna die out here!
Please let us in!

1219
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,920
We can't land.

1220
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,360
What do you mean it shouldn't land?
You wanna crash the plane or what?

1221
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,440
They'll hide in the cargo bay
till it's dark, then get out, all of them.

1222
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,240
We have to inform the authorities.

1223
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,920
What? And tell them what?
We have vampires on board?

1224
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,600
No, no, no, we have to...

1225
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,880
We have to land and then jump.

1226
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,960
Here. If we attach this to the fuel tank,

1227
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,000
it'll be enough
to blow up the whole plane.

1228
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,160
How do we get there?

1229
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,160
- That's the fuel tank.
- [Farid] Fuck. Shit.

1230
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,720
What?

1231
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,600
The detonator doesn't have a timer.
Do you have a remote?

1232
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,736
- [Bastian] Yeah. Curtiz had it.
- [Farid] Where is it?

1233
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,240
- Where is that asshole? Fuck.
- [Bastian] In the rear cargo hold.

1234
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
Okay.

1235
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,920
- Does this lead to the back?
- [Bastian] Yeah.

1236
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
Man!

1237
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,880
Shit, it's way too narrow.

1238
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,520
Is there another way to detonate it?

1239
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,640
Yeah, but then we'll blow up too.

1240
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,120
You land the plane.

1241
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,600
And as soon as you're out,

1242
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,720
I'll blow it up.

1243
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,840
No, Mama!

1244
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,640
- Yes, Elias.
- We can get you out of here.

1245
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,200
- You can hide in here.
- Elias, we have no other choice.

1246
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,120
Okay?

1247
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,120
- I can fit there. I can get the remote.
- Elias, it's over!

1248
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,520
You hear me?

1249
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,480
- Forgive me, please.
- I can get past them with this.

1250
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,320
Give me... [screams]

1251
