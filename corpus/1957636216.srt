1
00:00:01,248 --> 00:00:03,915
(pigs snorting)

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,339
- Kill the pigs, kill the pigs,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,359
kill the pigs, kill the pigs!

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,533
Yeah, whoo!

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:14,588
Whoo, yeah!

6
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:15,530
Let's do it!

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,363
Get those pigs!

8
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:17,196
We're gonna kill 'em!

9
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,934
Yeah! (laughs)

10
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,238
Woo-hoo!

11
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,072
Yeah!

12
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:22,526
Hey, Annie, we're gonna kill your pigs.

13
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:23,832
You hear that?

14
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,250
- You stay away from my pigs!

15
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:32,214
(gun fires)
(upbeat music)

16
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,548
(gun fires)

17
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:39,801
(singing in foreign language)

18
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:50,531
- Annie!

19
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:52,234
Annie, stop shooting!

20
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,318
Are you out of your mind?

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,262
- You're late.

22
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:59,379
- I know, I know, I am sorry,

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,419
but you can't go around shooting
children with a shotgun.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,923
- Oh, I load up with
bacon rind or rock salt.

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,083
Not gonna kill 'em,

26
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:11,565
it's the smart a little. (chuckles)

27
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,809
- They're children.

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,714
- Oh, they're hooligans!

29
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,059
Besides, there's nothing
to do in this town

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,229
except scare pigs and shoot children.

31
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,779
Whoop-de-doo.

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,613
Here, baby.

33
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,799
- You could've hit the T-bird.

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,548
- Georgio needs to walk.

35
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,799
- (sighs) I'll walk him.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,879
- Go to Aunt Darnella.

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,844
Yeah, sweetie.

38
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:31,919
(chuckles)

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,653
Can you do it?
- Oh sweetheart.

40
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,427
(indistinct)

41
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:38,243
You're so beautiful, yes you are.

42
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:40,119
Oh, yes you are, sweetheart.

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,699
- The sweetest little thing.

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,237
Yeah.
(shushing)

45
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,738
- Very good.
- Yes.

46
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:47,289
- Okay.
- All right.

47
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,276
I'll walk him, you go inside.

48
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,359
- Yeah.

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,129
Freezing. (shivers)

50
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,130
- It's brisk.

51
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,163
It's a beautiful, brisk,
perfect Thanksgiving day.

52
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,382
- Whoop-de-doo.

53
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:04,011

- I'm Horace Weitzel.

79
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,123
Pleased to meet you, Mary.

80
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,083
Mind if I ask a personal question?

81
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,959
- I'm 16, I'm not married.

82
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,499
I ran away from home.

83
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,626
I'm just about eight months pregnant

84
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:22,279
and I'm going to see my
father in Los Angeles.

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,639
I'm having the baby there.

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,803
Does that pretty much cover it?

87
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,653
- No, not really.

88
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,759
- Well, that's about
all I've got, you know?

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,453
- I was gonna ask if you like polka music.

90
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,519
- Polka music?
- Yeah.

91
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,239
Frankie Yankovic, the Polka King.

92
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,483
Myron Floren.

93
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,720
You never heard of Myron Floren?

94
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,009
- No.

95
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,010
- Here.

96
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,309
- What's this?

97
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,469
- What do you mean, "What's this?"

98
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,259
That's an 8-track.

99
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,469
Arnie Alavancus and his Polka Princes.

100
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,703
Put that puppy right in there, kiddo.

101
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,800

Are you hungry?

110
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,823
- [Mary] I'm pregnant.

111
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm always hungry.

112
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,559
- Well, we're gonna stop
in at the Kaiyute Casino.

113
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,209
They got an all-you-can-eat buffet there

114
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,149
that will rival anything in Vegas,

115
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,319
especially on Thanksgiving.

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,709
I got a sweetheart there.

117
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,543
- You do?

118
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:38,179
- What do you mean, "You do?"

119
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,253
She's a showgirl.

120
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,463
These flowers are for her.

121
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:45,070
- You're going with a showgirl?

122
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:46,876
- Yeah, I'm going with a showgirl.

123
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:49,213
And not just any showgirl, either.

124
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,919
Darnella Dare.

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,539
She was in all those big reviews in Vegas.

126
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,559
Sinatra gave her a T-bird.

127
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,169
You heard of him, haven't you?

128
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,719
- Frank Sinatra?

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,429
- No, Marty Sinatra.

130
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,779
Of course Frank Sinatra,
the chairman of the board.

131
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,999
Francis Albert Sinatra
gave her a T-bird in Vegas

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,103
right after Ava Gardner dumped him.

133
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,319
- Who's Ava Gardner?

134
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
- Oh, kid.

135
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,423

that Sean Connery wore in "Goldfinger".

142
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:35,851
- It looks good.

143
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:36,989
- All the ladies love it.

144
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,970
Come on, I wanna introduce you

145
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,829
to the owner of the establishment.

146
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,319
She's the last of the Kaiyute Indians.

147
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,030
- Lillian!
- Horace, darling!

148
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,599
(speaking Yiddish)

149
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,699
- I want you to meet my friend.

150
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,419
Mary, this is Lillian Littlefeather,

151
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,359
the last of the Kaiyutes.

152
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,429
- My husband, Marty Littlefeather,

153
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,509
was the last of the Kaiyutes,
may he rest in peace.

154
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,579
I'm just a Kaiyute by marriage.

155
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,116
But now I'm the last of
the Kaiyutes. (chuckles)

156
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:06,949
So, darling, when are you due?

157
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,299
- Uh, in about a month or so.

158
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,190
- Oh.

159
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,290
Well, as they say in
Kaiyute, (speaking Yiddish).

160
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,069
(speaking Yiddish)

161
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,239
- Would you see that Darnella gets these?

162
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,969
- Of course, Horace.

163
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,019
Lovely. (laughs)

164
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,879
Horace, you know where
the buffet table is,

165
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,199
so help yourself.

166
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,669
And get this beautiful
young girl some food.

167
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,210
She's eating for two, you know.

168
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:33,211
(breathing heavily)

169
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,580
(drum roll)

170
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,319
- Good evening, ladies and germs,

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,189
and welcome to the Kaiyute Casino Review.

172
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,639
I am your host, Cheeky Blaine,

173
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,519
and we have got special,
special guest for you.

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,609
We have got the king
of rock and roll, baby,

175
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,059
backed up by the musical
stylings of the Wise Men.

176
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,169
Not to mention, we've
got those gorgeous gals,

177
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,109
the Kaiyute Caiyuties.

178
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,760
Now, you all stand by now
and get ready for the show.

179
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:04,477
- All right.

180
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,340
Come on, move it girls.

181
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,349
Five minutes.

182
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,666
- You know that Horace
thinks he's your boyfriend.

183
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,776
- (laughs) He's harmless.

184
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:14,351
He just likes to have
someone to give flowers to.

185
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,059
- I wish someone would bring me flowers.

186
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,549
My boyfriend brings home a six-pack,

187
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,122
he thinks it's New Year's Eve.

188
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,059
(laughing)

189
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,226
(applauding)
- Thank you.

190
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:22,147
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

191
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:23,586

192
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:25,938
As you know, the holidays are here.

193
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,230
It's a time of happiness and cheer.

194
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,076
But while my friends are celebratin',

195
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:32,226

241
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,787
that Sean Connery wore in "Goldfinger"?

242
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,048
- Hmm.
- I love this suit.

243
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,716
(playful music)

244
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,838
(siren blaring)

245
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,829
- Would you believe he won
the jackpot on the last pull?

246
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,189
Darling, he would want you to have this.

247
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,689
- Oh, he was such a sweet man.

248
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,523
- Yeah.

249
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,129
At least he went out doing what he loved,

250
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,879
eating and playing the slots.

251
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,808
He was so full, full of life.

252
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,243
- Well, you can't ask for
anything better than that.

253
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:01,779
- No!
(laughing)

254
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,249
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry
for your loss as well.

255
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,479
I know he was your friend, too.

256
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,169
- Actually, he just gave me a ride.

257
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,229
I was hitchhiking and-

258
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,818
- Hitchhiking, in your condition?

259
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,196
- Oh my god.
- Um, yeah.

260
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:15,189
I'm on my way to see my dad.

261
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,819
I'm gonna get my stuff out of his truck

262
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,329
and I'm gonna try to get another ride.

263
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,039
But I really am sorry about your friend.

264
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,909
He was a really nice guy, and uh,

265
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,439
he liked polka music.

266
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,273
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

267
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,579
He loved polka music.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,089
- It was nice meeting y'all.

269
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,719
- Oh, honey, wait a minute.

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,369
You can't expect to stand out here

271
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,179
in this freezing cold weather

272
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,219
eight months pregnant

273
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,109
expecting to find a ride on Thanksgiving.

274
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,879
- I just, I don't know what-

275
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,499
- You can stay with me.

276
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,669
You can spend the night,

277
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,939
and then tomorrow, uh,

278
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,409
tomorrow's another day.

279
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,619
- You're welcome to stay
with me, too, darling.

280
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,159
I mean, but I have to warn you,

281
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,669
my husband, Mr. Littlefeather,

282
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,317
used to say I snore like
a moose in heat. (laughs)

283
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,151
- Uh.

284
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,770
- She'll stay with me.
- Very wise.

285
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,505
Okay.

286
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,923

292
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,299
but I've promised her that I'd come over.

293
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,399
- [Mary] Wow.

294
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,119
What is this place?

295
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,933
- Well, Annie calls it a pig farm.

296
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,769
But she never sells any of them.

297
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,443
They just die of old age
in a loving environment.

298
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,419
It's actually more of a pig hospice,

299
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,297
when you think about it.

300
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,508
(Annie snoring)

301
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,849
- I really am sorry
about your friend Horace,

302
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,850
the way he died.

303
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,330
- Oh, I don't believe in death.

304
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,473
I just think of it as
taking off our spacesuits.

305
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,199
- So, your Christmas lights are up early.

306
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,223
- Oh, I leave them up all year long.

307
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,302
The Christmas spirit is just so nice.

308
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,903
It's a shame to save it for Christmas.

309
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,339
So, now, you take the bed

310
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,689
and I'll sleep on the convertible sofa.

311
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,523
- No, I couldn't do that.

312
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,826
- Well, of course you
could, you're pregnant.

313
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,369
You need your sleep.

314
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,079
Your baby needs your sleep,

315
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,959
or his sleep, or her sleep, or-

316
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,589
- No, honestly, I couldn't.

317
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,499
I'll be fine on the couch.

318
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,839
- Oh, it's no trouble.

319
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,519
- It's okay, I've got my monkey pillow.

320
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I'll be fine.

321
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:25,268
(crickets chirping)

322
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,679
- You okay over there?

323
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,037
- Monkey pillow and red satin sheets.

324
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,223
- (laughs) Can't beat that.

325
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,249
Do you know what you're gonna have?

326
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,809
- A bowling ball.

327
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,623
- (laughs) I meant a boy or a girl.

328
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,453
- Uh, whatever, you know.

329
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,519
- What do you mean, "Whatever"?

330
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,109
You're having a baby.

331
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,329
You're bringing new life into the world.

332
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,363
Aren't you excited?

333
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,330
- I'm a runaway.

334
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,049
I hitched a ride with a
polka-loving truck driver

335
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,269
who died of a heart attack.

336
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,703
It's not like I've got this
all planned out, you know?

337
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,969
- I'm sorry.

338
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,089
- No, it's okay.

339
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,609
You're being really nice.

340
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,850
It's just, uh...

341
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,872
It's just, uh. (laughs)

342
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,143
It's so screwed up.

343
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,939
Everything's so screwed up.

344
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,420
I'm so screwed up.

345
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,849
- You know, sometimes
things don't turn out

346
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,933
the way we planned.

347
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,649
But then sometimes the very same things

348
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,900
turn out to be blessings.

349
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,769
- The truth is, I'm only having it

350
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,570
because my parents don't want me to.

351
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,009
- Well, (sighs) sometimes when people

352
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,389
are under financial pressures

353
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,749
and they have other mouths to feed-

354
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,853
- Financial pressure?

355
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,399
They're rich.

356
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,793
I'm rich, we're rich.

357
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,530
They could afford to feet 20 more mouths.

358
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,483
I was an embarrassment.

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,669
I go to boarding school,

360
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,293
and everyone there would know.

361
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,129
All of the girls, all of their parents.

362
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,793
Everyone in their social circle.

363
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,129
So, they said "Come home
and have an abortion.

364
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,419
We'll say it was appendicitis."

365
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,120
And then I would go back and
everything would be fine.

366
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:34,885
Except the point is-

367
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
- What?

368
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,989
- It doesn't matter.

369
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,990
It's stupid.

370
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,723
I'm stupid, it doesn't matter.

371
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,609
- You're not stupid.

372
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,610
Don't say that.

373
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,723
What doesn't matter?

374
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,533
- I went away to boarding school
when I was eight years old,

375
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,829
and before that it was nannies and maids,

376
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,720
and they were traveling, or...

377
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,879
The point is, I didn't want everything

378
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,053
to be okay, all right?

379
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,139
I didn't want them to be able
to say it was appendicitis,

380
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,229
and everything would go
back to the way it was.

381
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,009
I didn't want everything to
be back to the way it was.

382
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,603
I hated the way it was.

383
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,183
I wanted them to have to deal with it,

384
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
to deal with me.

385
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,471
- And what did they say?

386
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,372
- They said that I was having
an abortion, that was that.

387
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:45,239
That they're not gonna be made fools of

388
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,103
because their daughter is a tramp.

389
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,847
So, I said "Fine, tell
your friends I'm dead."

390
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
And I ran.

391
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,117
Could I have a glass of water, please?

392
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:00,118
- Of course.

393
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,807
(water running)

394
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,940
How long have you been running?

395
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,953
- Oh, three months.

396
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,239
I call them, you know?

397
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,849
I buy on of those pay as you go phones,

398
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,750
and I ditch it so they can't trace it.

399
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:27,223
I stay with friends.

400
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:32,053
And now I'm going to my
dad's, because he's cool.

401
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
He gets it.

402
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:36,638
He gets me.

403
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,890
He'll get the kid, too.

404
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:44,765
I wanna move in, and I'll have
the kid and take care of it.

405
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,163
Him, her, it. (chuckles)

406
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:51,688
- The baby.

407
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
- The baby.

408
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,293
- Your baby.

409
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
- My baby.

410
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,023
- When I wasn't much older
than you, I got pregnant.

411
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,103
And at first all I thought about was,

412
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,683
what was going on with me?

413
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:25,163
But now you're the mom.

414
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,059
And your baby is going
to be depending on you

415
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,523
making the right decisions.

416
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,473
- Yeah, well I made the right decision.

417
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,574
I'm going to my dad's.

418
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,863
- Well, good.

419
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,419
Now you can make another right decision.

420
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,769
Go to sleep. (laughs)

421
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,369
Do you have a nighty, or some pajamas?

422
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,609
- I'll just sleep in my underwear.

423
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,093
- You'll do no such thing.

424
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,370
I'll give you one of my nightgowns.

425
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,723
(humming)

426
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,619
um, oops.

427
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,149
Maybe not that one.

428
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,450
Oh, I have just the thing!

429
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,560
Annie made them for me.

430
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,069
I've never worn them.

431
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,584
- [Mary] Piggy jammies?

432
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,343
- (laughs) They'll keep you snug as a bug.

433
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
- [Mary] Thanks.

434
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,425
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

435
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,426
Sleep tight.

436
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:29,988
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

437
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,425
(soft music)

438
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:43,255
(cheerful music)

439
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:45,969
(laughs)

440
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,289
- So, this is what you do every day?

441
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,290
Walk the pig?

442
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,219
- Well, Annie isn't as
spry as she used to be,

443
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,199
and uh, Georgio needs his exercise.

444
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,763
And it's such a beautiful day.

445
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,759
- But you're really not walking it,

446
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,973
you're holding it.

447
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:03,889
- Well, Georgio hurt his little pig foot

448
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,849
and the vet said he should stay
off of it for about a month.

449
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,439
But he's a very social pig,

450
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,413
and he loves to be out and about.

451
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,119
Oh.

452
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,159
There's Ms. Dorkus.

453
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,963
She owns the trailer park.
(playful orchestral music)

454
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,039
Good morning, Ms. Dorkus.

455
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,109
- What's so good about it?

456
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,199
- Well, it's just a beautiful day, is all.

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,359
- The economy is in a dump,

458
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,299
you live in a dump, I own a dump.

459
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,739
So, what have you got
to be so cheery about

460
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,279
all the time, anyway?

461
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,499
- Well, I just think
that life is wonderful.

462
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,109
- It's crap.

463
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,179
- Oh, you know that's not true.

464
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,499
You're just saying that.

465
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,703
This is my friend, Mary.

466
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,893
- Pregnant runaway teenager.

467
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,389
- Got it.

468
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,703
- I rest my case.

469
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,659
- Well, you just have a
wonderful day, Mrs. Dorkus.

470
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,403
- Well, your rent is due, Ms. Cheerful.

471
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:05,605
(playful orchestral music)

472
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,949
- Oh dear, I almost forgot.

473
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,783
- What?

474
00:23:12,784 --> 00:23:15,069
- Horace, he was Jewish,

475
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,779
and they have to be buried the next day.

476
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,959
And I don't even think we
have another Jew in this town.

477
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,839
So here, why don't you
finish walking Georgio,

478
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,190
and I'll go look for a
Jew in the Yellow Pages.

479
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,129
- Nice pig.

480
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,130
- Nice bike.

481
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,315
- You live around here?

482
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,230
- No, I'm going to L.A.

483
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:40,929
My dad lives there.

484
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,959
- Cool.

485
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,619
- He's in a rock band.

486
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,227
- Way cool.

487
00:23:45,228 --> 00:23:46,639
Is he like, famous?

488
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,473
- Limping Lions.

489
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,906
He had a big single in the '80s.

490
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,357
"Apocalypse Momma"?

491
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,630
- Oh yeah, that was like...

492
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,317
No, I'm thinking of Guns N' Roses.

493
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:56,939
- No, but they did a gig with them once.

494
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,409
- They did?

495
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,559
- They were like fourth in the bill,

496
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,349
but they got to see them and everything.

497
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,350
- Information?

498
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,693
Yes, for Kaiyute, New Mexico.

499
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
I'd like the number for anything Jewish.

500
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,930
- How long have you lived here?

501
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:16,437
- (sighs) I don't know.

502
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,793
Since my mom lost her job.

503
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,173
Couple of months, maybe.

504
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Why?

505
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,739
- This place?

506
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,346
I don't know, it's really odd.

507
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,133
- (laughs) No duh.

508
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,633
- I mean, I woke up this
morning and I had piggy feet.

509
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,219
I don't know.

510
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,117
It's like, bizarro showgirl
"Alice in Wonderland".

511
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,080
- Mary, let's go, I found a Jew!

512
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,109
- Speaking of "Alice in Wonderland",

513
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,279
we found a Jew.

514
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,946
Here, hold my pig.

515
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:52,864
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

516
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,637
- I just found out that
Lillian Littlefeather

517
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,023
is really Jewish.

518
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,180
I never even thought that

519
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,199
because who would think that Littlefeather

520
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,493
is really a Jewish name?

521
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,129
But anyway, Horace wasn't very religious,

522
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,559
but um, I wanted to honor his religion

523
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,559
and have someone from
his faith say a prayer.

524
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,983
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

525
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,253
Lillian knows 'em all.

526
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,593
Not all the Jews, but all the prayers.

527
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:41,197
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

528
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:44,039
- Did you ever wanna be anything else?

529
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,319
I mean, anything other than a showgirl?

530
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,779
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

531
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
- A flamenco dancer.

532
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,079
I just have a feeling that
we're missing something

533
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,350
that Horace might want.

534
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:06,084
- I think I know what it might be.

535
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:10,815
(upbeat polka music)

536
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,805
♪ I wish I could learn to yodel ♪

537
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,853
♪ But I really don't know how ♪

538
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:16,706

00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,036

00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,757

541
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:23,895
♪ I'd yodel when I'm blue

- Darnella, you did a mitzvah today.

553
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:48,255
- Oh.

554
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:49,088
What's a mitzvah?

555
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:51,479
- A mitzvah is, uh, in Kaiyute,

556
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,089
it means a good deed.

557
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,149
What is with you with this
(speaking Yiddish) veil?

558
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,983
Goodbye, darling.

559
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,529
I've gotta get back to the club.

560
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,863
Give me a kiss.

561
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:01,369
- It's glamorous, darling.
- Nice to meet you.

562
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,367
- Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

563
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:04,823
Bye darling!
- Bye, Lillian.

564
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,693
- [Lillian] Whoo!

565
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:07,526
For the same money

566
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,109
they could've planted him a little closer.

567
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,506
Oi, I've got this hip replacement,

568
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,507
they don't understand I can't walk.

569
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,341
(indistinct)

570
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,779
- I should go back to the
trailer and get my stuff

571
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,369
and get back on the road,

572
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,699
but thank you for everything.

573
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,250
It was really nice meeting you.

574
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,899
- No.

575
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,299
- What do you mean?

576
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,549
- Well, I mean, it's getting dark already

577
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,889
and um, thank you for all the help

578
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,880
you gave me with the funeral.

579
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:36,493
I couldn't have, uh, pulled
it together without you.

580
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,279
Anyway, you could just spend the night,

581
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,833
and um, you know, tomorrow's another day.

582
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,879
- I don't wanna put you out again.

583
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,769
- I won't hear another word about it.

584
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,159
And you shouldn't be hitchhiking anyway.

585
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,743
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

586
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,383
- Truth is, I'm scared.

587
00:27:56,848 --> 00:27:57,681
- About having the baby?

588
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,103
- About all of it.

589
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,850
Nothing's simple anymore.

590
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
- Marshmallows are.

591
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,920
- I think I'll take her shopping tomorrow.

592
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:14,141
- I thought you were leaving tomorrow.

593
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:15,559
Didn't she say she was leaving tomorrow?

594
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
- I know.

595
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,640
I know, but maybe I'll take her shopping.

596
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:22,883
I thought maybe I'll buy
her something tasteful.

597
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,539
She doesn't have any maternity outfits,

598
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,083
only those awful t-shirts.

599
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,419
Something pretty.

600
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,823
- You wanna go see a DVD?

601
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,369
- Sure.

602
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,333
- I got "Princess Bride",
"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"

603
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:40,334
- Okay.

604
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,979
Oh, this is good.

605
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,509
- I knew it. (laughs)

606
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,510
- Knew what?

607
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,869
- Well, you're doing it.

608
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,703
- Doing what?

609
00:28:52,703 --> 00:28:53,703
What am I doing?

610
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,159
- What you always do. (laughs)

611
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,729
- I don't know what you're talking about.

612
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,393
- Every time you meet a new man,

613
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,773
you start spinning fairytales.

614
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,910
He's Prince Charming, and he's
the one who understands you.

615
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,169
Or, or, you're reading

616
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,449
one of those Vegas magazines of yours,

617
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,909
they're opening a hotel

618
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,819
and they're gonna do the
old-style reviews again.

619
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
- They are!

620
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:23,099
It's just a matter of time.

621
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,699
Glamor is going to make a comeback.

622
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,023
- And you're playing the Kaiyute Casino.

623
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,579
That's it, toots, that's
the end of the line.

624
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,909
After this you'll be a
waitress in a greasy spoon

625
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,419
pouring coffee for rednecks.

626
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,779
- I am not gonna listen
to this negativity.

627
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,853
- I know you like a book.

628
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,219
She's gonna go back to high school,

629
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,219
and then she'll have the baby,

630
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,389
and then she'll stay because
she won't have any place to go,

631
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,859
and then you'll be like a grandma,

632
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,139
and we'll live happily ever after.

633
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Fairytales.

634
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,370
- Maybe not.

635
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,370
You don't know.

636
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,600
- It's what you're thinking.

637
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,499
I know what you're thinking.

638
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,879
- What if I am?

639
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,329
Family isn't just a
question of, well, family.

640
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,919
Sometimes we choose our family,

641
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,599
sometimes we make our own families.

642
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,629
- And what happens to me?

643
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,630
Huh?

644
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,763
What happens to me?

645
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,451
- Oh, Annie.

646
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,383
Is that what this is all about?

647
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,017
I love you.

648
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,719
You're my family.

649
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,483
And nothing is gonna change that.

650
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,133
Still, it might be nice,

651
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,530
a little bit bigger family, hmm?

652
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,033
- You had a daughter.

653
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,790
You gave her up.

654
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,123
You can't get her back with some stray.

655
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,930
- I'm not gonna listen to this anymore.

656
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:12,897
- You think only a man can
break your heart, Darnella?

657
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,209
- Shopping?
- Yeah.

658
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,429
- For what?

659
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,053
- I don't know, something
young and pretty and tasteful.

660
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,053
You know, not just t-shirts.

661
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,570
- Thanks, but you've done
enough already for me.

662
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:39,410
- No, it's no bother.

663
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,410
It would be fun.

664
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,599
- Yeah, but I need go to
go L.A., to see my dad.

665
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,263
- Oh yeah, but you can go
to L.A. in something pretty.

666
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,399
- Darnella, you're being really nice,

667
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,813
but I think he'll probably
wanna buy me stuff.

668
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
- Oh, yeah.

669
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,909
- I mean, I'm his daughter

670
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,660
and it's gonna be his grandkid, so.

671
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Excuse me.
- No.

672
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,239
No, you're, you're right.

673
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,643
You're (sighs), you're absolutely right.

674
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Yeah.

675
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,603
Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

676
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,440
- Does your father know you're coming?

677
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,740
- Well, what do you mean?

678
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,559
- I mean, have you talked to him?

679
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,163
Is he expecting you?

680
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,039
- Well sure, what are you talking about?

681
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,969
Of course he knows I'm coming.

682
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,999
- Why didn't he send
you an airplane ticket,

683
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,713
or a bus ticket?

684
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,459
I, I'm sorry, I had no right
to ask you that question.

685
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,743
No, it's none of my
business and I apologize.

686
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,103
- What do you think?

687
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,103
He doesn't wanna see me?

688
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,859
- No, no, I never said that.

689
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,373
- My father loves me, okay?

690
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,239
- Well, I, I'm sure he
does, it's just that-

691
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,521
- What?

692
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:12,599
- (sighs) Well, it's just that,

693
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,719
you know, you're welcome to stay here.

694
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,119
You know, it's no bother,

695
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,939
and if things don't work out-

696
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,549
- My father loves me,

697
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,539
and he's not some uptight
jerk like my mother.

698
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,899
He's not gonna get all worried
that I'm gonna embarrass him

699
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,659
or make him feel like a
fool, 'cause he's cool.

700
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,329
He's in a band.

701
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,833
He knows Axl Rose, okay?

702
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,509
- I apologize.

703
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,309
- And I really appreciate

704
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,529
you taking me in for the
night and all, but that's it.

705
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,223
I mean, you're really nice,

706
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,301
but it's kinda weird here.

707
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:47,409
I'm a little weirded out.

708
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,169
And I gotta be honest,
you and your friends,

709
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,210
I mean, there's a huge
weirdness factor here, you know?

710
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:12,246
- You think I'm...

711
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:14,320
You think my friends...

712
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,203
You think we're weird?

713
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,270
- Well, you know,

714
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,870
pig lady,

715
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,363
kinda creepy, you know?

716
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,059
- She's a lonely old lady, Mary,

717
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,730
and all she has in life are
some aging pigs, and me.

718
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,003
- I'm sorry, I'm just-
- No.

719
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,029
I apologize.

720
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,459
I'll take you down to
the bus station tomorrow.

721
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,919
- It's okay, I can hitch.

722
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,220
Can't afford a bus ticket.

723
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,650
- Sure you can.

724
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,683
The last thing Horace
did was hit the jackpot.

725
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,070
He would want you to have it.

726
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,859
It's uh, almost $200
in very cold quarters.

727
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,770
- I can't take this.
- Sure you can.

728
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,737
He told you he'd get you to L.A.,

729
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,530
and I never knew him to break his word.

730
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,329
- Listen, I really appreciate

731
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,880
you letting me stay here
these last couple of days.

732
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,870
- I've had the happiest
time getting to know you.

733
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,130
- And I didn't mean what I said,

734
00:35:39,131 --> 00:35:41,213
about you and your friends being weird.

735
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,140
- Maybe we're not weird, but,

736
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,193
colorful.
- (laughs) Colorful.

737
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,910
I will never forget you. (laughs)

738
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:55,328
(soft music)

739
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:27,569
- Yeah?
(rock music)

740
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,570
- Dad?

741
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,761
- Oh!

742
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:32,439
My god.

743
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Mary.

744
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,369
You look so much older
than in your last picture,

745
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,099
and uh, so much more preggers.

746
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,459
- Mom didn't tell you?

747
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,027
- No, no.

748
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,623
Dude, dude, dude, you're preggers.

749
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:50,103
- Dude.

750
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,433
Can I like, come in?

751
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:58,220
- Oh yeah, sure, kid.

752
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,299
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make you stand outside.

753
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,083
Yeah, you know (speaks
Spanish), come on in.

754
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,530
Dude.

755
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,987
I'm a grandfather.

756
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:19,639
Man, I mean, this can't
get into Rolling Stone.

757
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,510
- Dad, don't worry.

758
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:22,559
You guys aren't that famous anymore.

759
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,899
- Ouch.

760
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,530
Slings and arrows, ooh.

761
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,909
- Please tell me you just
got back from somewhere.

762
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,959
- Oh, no, dude, I'm just
getting ready to go.

763
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,819
We got a three-month tour.

764
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,539
We got New Zealand, Australia,
some weird gig in Singapore,

765
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,639
and we end up playing for
some sheik in Abu Dhabi

766
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,289
who's like a total freak
for "Apocalypse Momma".

767
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,799
I mean, like, I thought
you were the limo driver.

768
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,003
- Abu Dhabi, cool.

769
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,009
- So, uh...

770
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,010
So like, what are you doing here, Mersy?

771
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:55,999
- What am I doing here?

772
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,050
I'm pregnant.

773
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,573
- So?

774
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:01,419
You should be, like, with your mom, right?

775
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,420
And Phil.

776
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,959
- They wanted me to have an abortion.

777
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,109
- Uh-huh.

778
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,110
- Uh-huh?

779
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,069
Well, I wasn't gonna get one,

780
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,509
so I wanted to come here

781
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,069
'cause I thought you would understand.

782
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,680
And, I mean.

783
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:19,299
- Mersy, you didn't even call
and tell me you were coming.

784
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,569
- I'm your daughter.

785
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,459
- I know that, and that's why I had

786
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,879
this who summer mapped out,

787
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,989
you know, with moms for the school year

788
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,769
and me for the summer.

789
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,816
I'm down with that.

790
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:30,469
But I mean, dude, you just show up-

791
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,889
- Stop saying dude.

792
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,723
You're an adult.

793
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:33,556
You're almost 50.

794
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:34,407
You're my father.

795
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,324
(intercom buzzing)

796
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,688
- Yeah?

797
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:49,959
- [Driver] Mr. Prentis, I'm your driver.

798
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,640
- Yeah, I'll be right
with you. Just chill.

799
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,399
- Mersy, I don't know what you want me-

800
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,411
- Don't call me Mersy.

801
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:00,499
I'm not a little girl.

802
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,149
I'm about to be a mother.

803
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,319
- I don't know what you
want me to say, Mary.

804
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,719
I've got to leave on tour.

805
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,499
That's where the child support payments

806
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,269
come from, me, touring.

807
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,279
That's where the money for
your private school comes from.

808
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,209
That's where all of it comes from.

809
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,549
- I'm talking about supporting me,

810
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,749
not support with payments, not
tuition for a fancy school-

811
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,369
- Look, man, Mersy...

812
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,453
Mary, I'm sorry.

813
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,179
You need a place to crash,
you're welcome to stay here.

814
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,919
The place is yours.

815
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,939
And you know what? I'm gonna
text you the name of a doctor

816
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,129
and I'll pay all the, you know,
the doctor bills and stuff.

817
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,999
But I've gotta be on this tour.

818
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,219
I mean, (chuckles) look at me,

819
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,539
I'm an over the hill rocker

820
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,979
who's had one gig in life.

821
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,769
I blow this and I got nothing.

822
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,299
I mean, you didn't even call

823
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,469
to tell me you were coming, man.

824
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,470
- This is when I need you the most, Dad.

825
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,239
- Hey, you know what?

826
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,140
You want it that way,

827
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,099
you wanna try and lay a guilt trip on me,

828
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,269
it's not happening.

829
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,339
If this is where you needed me the most,

830
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,809
you should've picked up
the phone and called me

831
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,913
and let me know what was going on.

832
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,663
- Yeah?

833
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:08,479
And what would you have said?

834
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,869
- Hey, well, I don't know, okay?

835
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,069
Like we'll never know
'cause it never happened.

836
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,070
- Sure we do.

837
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,137
You would've said, "I gotta go on tour."

838
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:25,570
(sighs heavily)

839
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
- Here's the key.

840
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,113
The place is yours.

841
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,273
Mary, I love you.

842
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,523
It's all I've got, kid.

843
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,933
It's all I've got.

844
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:54,405
(soft music)

845
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:10,939
(phone ringing)

846
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,509
- [Meg] Hello, this is Meg.

847
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,402
If you'd like to leave a
message for me, press one.

848
00:41:15,403 --> 00:41:18,069
If you're calling for Phil, press two.

849
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,599
Mary's away at school,

850
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,579
unless you're calling at the holidays,

851
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,529
in which case press three,

852
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,277
and one of us will get back
to you as soon as we can.

853
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,570
- Hi, Mom, it's me.

854
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,116
I'm okay.

855
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,449
I'm at Dad's.

856
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,356
You were right about him.

857
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:41,107
I should've listened.

858
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:47,535
Maybe it's time for me to come home.

859
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:48,619
I don't know.

860
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,739
I

861
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,313
Don't have anywhere else to go.

862
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:07,622
(laughing)

863
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:11,697
- Oh.

864
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:18,371
Oh. (crying)

865
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,205
- Can I stay here?

866
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,119
I mean, you said I could.

867
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,649
- Of course you can stay here.

868
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,599
Of course you can stay here.

869
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,224
And tomorrow we'll take
you to the obstetrician

870
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:30,619
and we'll buy you some maternity clothes,

871
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,620
we'll get a crib.

872
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,729
Well, a very small crib.

873
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,009
I don't know, we'll figure out something.

874
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,352
But (laughs) but yes, of course.

875
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:41,693
Of course you can stay
here, it'll be perfect.

876
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:47,655
(singing in foreign language)

877
00:42:58,822 --> 00:42:59,690
(banging)

878
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:01,499
You're invited to dinner.

879
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,519
- When?
- Now.

880
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,239
Mary's back.

881
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,749
- Geez.

882
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,869
Merry Christmas.

883
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,119
- No, not one word out of you.

884
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,199
You're gonna come to dinner
and you're gonna be nice.

885
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,253
And do you know why?

886
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,779
- Why?

887
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,499
- Because you're going to
be a great grandmother,

888
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,239
and nobody likes a great grandmother

889
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,039
who is a sourpuss.

890
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,959
- What are you talking about?

891
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,499
- Mary is moving in with me.

892
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,479
She's going to have the baby here.

893
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,599
Remember what I said to you

894
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,659
about people who are
alone who choose a family?

895
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,969
Well, this family just
got a little bit bigger,

896
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,343
and you can choose to be in it, or not.

897
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,699
- I don't like to be bossed around.

898
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
- Tough!

899
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,239
You know how to knit?

900
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,713
I need booties, and a bonnet.

901
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,039
- Little booties?

902
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,191
Little piggy booties?

903
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,689
- What a wonderful idea.

904
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,226
I never thought of that.

905
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,109
- Has she told her parents?

906
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,879
- Uh, yeah, I think that's
how this whole thing started.

907
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,049
- That she's staying with you

908
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,800
and she's gonna have the baby here?

909
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,773
- No.

910
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,606
No, you're right.

911
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,689
Uh, they would be worried
to death about her.

912
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,140
I'll make sure she calls them right away.

913
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:16,199
(answering machine beeping)

914
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,002
- [Darnella] Leave a
message, don't just hang up.

915
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:19,980
- [Mary] Okay.

916
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:21,446
Hi, Mom, it's me.

917
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:24,419
I'm okay, I'm with
people who care about me.

918
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,199
I'm seeing a doctor.

919
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,699
I'm going to have a baby with
people that care about me,

920
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,289
in safe surroundings.

921
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,959
Uh, I'll call you after the baby's born.

922
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,549
Okay, bye.
(answering machine beeps)

923
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,409
- First she runs off to her
father's, god knows why,

924
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,699
then in the form of a message

925
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,999
she said she was coming home.

926
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,400
Why did she change her mind?

927
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,410
Do you think she's been drugged?

928
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,573
- Well, you can definitely hear someone.

929
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,799
Someone who's more mature

930
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,200
telling her to leave a
message at the beginning.

931
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,499
- Do you think she's been kidnapped?

932
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,241
- Well, have you gotten
any ransom demands?

933
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:08,189
- No.
- Not yet.

934
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,669
Maybe they're waiting
for the baby to be born.

935
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,899
Maybe that way, they think
they can charge more.

936
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,439
Our daughter, our grandchild.

937
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,407
God only knows how much they'll demand.

938
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,169
- Especially if they
find out we have money.

939
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,486
- Oh darling, all they have
to do is look at her teeth

940
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,037
and they'll know we have money.

941
00:45:25,962 --> 00:45:28,112
- Do you really think
she's been kidnapped?

942
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,629
- Well, (sighs) it's
certainly a possibility.

943
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,439
But you've got the number
tracked in the caller ID

944
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,499
and I got some connects down
at the police department

945
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,562
so we can track it.

946
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:39,709
Now, if she used a cell phone

947
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,069
it'll be a little bit more difficult,

948
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,799
but it ain't impossible.

949
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,269
- The reason we hired you
and your associates, Tony,

950
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,619
is that we don't want to
go to the police with this.

951
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,379
We certainly don't want the publicity.

952
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,219
- No one knows she's pregnant.

953
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,139
We've told the school
she's taking a break,

954
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,807
studying art in Florence.

955
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:01,879
Something like this
could ruin a young girl,

956
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,563
her reputation, her standing.

957
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,723
And it'd be awful for us.

958
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,459
- Darling, if she hasn't been kidnapped,

959
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,729
she's just run away, then.

960
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,599
- Well, then we know she's safe,

961
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,449
and we know she's pregnant.

962
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,529
She can't go traipsing around.

963
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,649
So I can reason with her, discreetly.

964
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,405
- Ah, I think that's
the key word here, Tony.

965
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,879
Discretion, yes?

966
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,486
- Hey, our agency is nothing
if not discreet, all right?

967
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,159
And look, I'ma do my thing.

968
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,069
If you get any more messages,
call me immediately.

969
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,659
Don't trip.

970
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,503
Oh, I'ma get your daughter
back, and your grandchild.

971
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:43,635
- Grandchild.

972
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,150
Big concept.
- Yes.

973
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:50,734

981
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,759
- It'll just be for the beginning

982
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,092
until we move to a bigger place,

983
00:47:35,093 --> 00:47:37,139
where we'll have a proper crib.

984
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,989
I just didn't think that having a baby

985
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,517
and moving at the same
time was a good idea.

986
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,029
- But what happened to
all of your pictures

987
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,548
and your lingerie, and stuff?

988
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:48,613
- That was the past.

989
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,873
This is the future.

990
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,329
Besides, I left Grandma Betty's mirror

991
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,473
and the picture of Frank in the T-bird.

992
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,569
- Lamaze is a breathing technique

993
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,489
that helps a woman focus on her body

994
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,390
rather than on the pain of
contractions during childbirth.

995
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,949
Yes?

996
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,395
- What if I want drugs?
- Oh, I want drugs.

997
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:15,959
- No.

998
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,679
- Well, that's what this class is,

999
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,489
to help you do without,

1000
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,169
so that you can have a natural childbirth.

1001
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,791
- Right, but what if I want natural drugs?

1002
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,209
(laughing)

1003
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,529
- Well, we'll discuss several
alternatives in a while,

1004
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,609
but these techniques really,
really are very effective.

1005
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,467
- Until you need the drugs, right?

1006
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,008
- We're gonna get to the drug part, okay?

1007
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:40,769
(laughing)
- Thank you.

1008
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,549
- But first, I want you to establish

1009
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,079
what we call your breathing baseline.

1010
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,799
(Mary gasps)

1011
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,403
- Oh, I felt him kick.

1012
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:53,923
It is so sweet.
(soft music)

1013
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,292
You're a good coach.
- Thank you very much.

1014
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:06,209
I take my job very seriously.
- Yes, he does.

1015
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,329
He's been so amazing about everything.

1016
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,330
- Wow.

1017
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,049
Look at this.

1018
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,763
- Mine.
- Whoa!

1019
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,810
Your mom's got a cool car.
- Thanks.

1020
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,243
My name is Joe, and this is Barbara.

1021
00:49:20,244 --> 00:49:21,349
- Mary.

1022
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,183
- Darnella Dare.

1023
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:23,939
- It's lovely to meet you guys.

1024
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,940
Would you wanna

1025
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,499
come over for a cup of
coffee, or something?

1026
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,209
We live just right by here.

1027
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,539
We're sorta new in town,

1028
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,459
and I just don't know anyone else

1029
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,219
who's having a baby except
for the people in this class.

1030
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,849
- Well, I have to be at work at eight.

1031
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,219
- No, yeah, it'll be cool.

1032
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,699
I mean, we're kinda new to this, too,

1033
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,533
and we're just getting

1034
00:49:41,534 --> 00:49:42,629
all the baby stuff together, you know?

1035
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,903
- [Barbara] Yeah, okay.

1036
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,703
Great.

1037
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:46,719
Why don't you guys follow us?

1038
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,806
- Okay.
- Okay.

1039
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:48,807

Look, it's a portable playpen.

1053
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,149

00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,409
- Do you know what you're having?

1057
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,669
- A baby.

1058
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,089
That's about it.

1059
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,890
- We didn't wanna ruin the surprise.

1060
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,029
- Oh, we saw this crib!

1061
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,469
- [Barbara] Oh, isn't it great?

1062
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:36,059
- I want this so much.

1063
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,009
But we just don't have the room.

1064
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,649
- Not yet, but we will have,

1065
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,969
possibly in a few months, you know?

1066
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,133
Maybe, yeah.

1067
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,220
- You guys are all hooked up.

1068
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,573
I mean, you like, thought of everything.

1069
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,479
- Well, we've been trying to
get pregnant for eight years,

1070
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,837
so I guess we had the
time to think about it.

1071
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:05,255
(slow music)

1072
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,747
- I just don't know if I'm
gonna be any good at it.

1073
00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:14,442
I don't know if you're
gonna be any good at it.

1074
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:15,709
I just.
- Oh.

1075
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,649
Oh, you're gonna be a wonderful mother,

1076
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,459
I know you are.

1077
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,460
And you know, uh, after the
baby is a little bit older,

1078
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,439
and whenever you think about it,

1079
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,433
um, you should go back to school.

1080
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,899
And I'll look after the baby,

1081
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,830
and Annie will help, and...

1082
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,009
We're the village.

1083
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,009
Or, the trailer park.

1084
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,163
But um, we're like a village.

1085
00:51:43,818 --> 00:51:44,837
Oh.

1086
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:45,838
What?

1087
00:51:46,985 --> 00:51:48,139
What?

1088
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,019
- I just remember when I was a little kid

1089
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,249
and I would get to come
home from boarding school

1090
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:57,299
for the holidays, and
there would be a tree.

1091
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,682
It was the only time I
felt like I had a family.

1092
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:02,183
And everyone was really happy.

1093
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,083
It's just different now.

1094
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,263
It's really different.

1095
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,688
I'm sorry.

1096
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,286
You're like, the nicest
person I've ever met,

1097
00:52:12,287 --> 00:52:14,709
and I'm being really ungrateful.

1098
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,159
- You're right.
- I know.

1099
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,099
I'm being a baby.
- No, no.

1100
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,149
You're not.

1101
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,019
I meant, you're right about Christmas.

1102
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,870
You are.

1103
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,253
And I never realized it until just now.

1104
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,169
(sighs) I am so tired of having

1105
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,999
frozen turkey TV dinners for the holidays.

1106
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,870
It sucks.

1107
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:35,199
- No, that frozen thing
we had on Thanksgiving,

1108
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,069
the first night, it was nice.

1109
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,020
- Sucks!

1110
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,349
Sucks big time.

1111
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:40,513
Sucks eggs!

1112
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,700
We are gonna have a real Christmas.

1113
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,773
A real, real Christmas.

1114
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:54,211
(singing in foreign language)

1115
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
- Yes?

1116
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,860
- Hi.

1117
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,693
- Okay, hi.

1118
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,329
What's wrong?

1119
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,809
What's broke?

1120
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,023
What's your complaint?

1121
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:17,229
- I don't have any complaints.

1122
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,439
Everything's just wonderful.

1123
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,629
- Then what are you doing here

1124
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,423
if everything's so hunky-dory?

1125
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,503
- I was just thinking-
- Don't strain yourself.

1126
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,680
- I was thinking...

1127
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,783
What is that wonderful smell?

1128
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,489
I mean, something smells delicious.

1129
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,129
- Of course something smells delicious.

1130
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,969
I've been cooking, and I'm a good cook,

1131
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,749
and that's the way my
food is supposed to smell.

1132
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,550
- But I mean that smells phenomenal.

1133
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,133
- That's my lots of meat lasagna.

1134
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,259
You can have a taste, if you like.

1135
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,439
- I don't wanna put you out.

1136
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,609
- You're not putting me out.

1137
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,253
I said you could have a taste.

1138
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,163
- Oh my gosh.
- Good, huh?

1139
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,229
- Oh my gosh, that's the-
- The best.

1140
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,689
- The best lasagna I have
ever had in my whole life.

1141
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,359
- You think that's good,
wait till you taste this.

1142
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,739
Fired asparagus with creole mustard sauce.

1143
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,639
It doesn't go with lasagna,

1144
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,249
but I said what the heck.

1145
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,883
Open, taste.

1146
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:30,130
- Mm.

1147
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:30,964
Mm.

1148
00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:32,839
Oh my gosh.

1149
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,399
- You've got to come up with
another list of expletives.

1150
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,239
It's getting boring.

1151
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,819
But it is nice to have somebody

1152
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,399
that appreciates good food.

1153
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,629
- We're gonna have a party.

1154
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,983
- Oh, no, no, no, no parties
allowed in this trailer park.

1155
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:53,299
- We're gonna have the
best Christmas party ever.

1156
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,809
Lillian's gonna close the
restaurant at the casino

1157
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,549
on Christmas Eve, that's
where we've gonna have it,

1158
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,299
and everybody's gonna make something.

1159
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,299
But there's gonna be a room full of people

1160
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,699
who are going to appreciate the best food

1161
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,799
they have ever had in their life

1162
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,979
because no matter what they eat,

1163
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,430
it's gonna pale in comparison
to what you can do.

1164
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,689
- I am not going to bust my hump

1165
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,183
making Christmas dinner
for a bunch of strangers.

1166
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,969
- They're not strangers, they're friends.

1167
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,180
- I haven't got any...

1168
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,299
I haven't got time to do a lot of cooking

1169
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,323
for some freeloaders.

1170
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,089
- Well, you're right.

1171
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,089
Lasagna doesn't go with Christmas,

1172
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,889
and if that's all you know
how to make, that and-

1173
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,969
- If that's all I know how to make?

1174
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,109
If that's all I know how to make?

1175
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,649
You're just saying that
because you have never had

1176
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,209
my slow-cooked black-eyed peas

1177
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,473
with ham bites,

1178
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,043
and my corn fried in butter,

1179
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,483
and my cornbread that tastes like cake.

1180
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,673
Oh my goodness, what am I talking about?

1181
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:07,659
Nuh-uh, it's too much trouble.

1182
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,853
- We can help.
- Who is we?

1183
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,773
- My girlfriends, me.

1184
00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:14,648
It'd be fun.

1185
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,673
Mrs. Dorkus, when was the
last time that you had fun?

1186
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,103
- I have fun when I cook.

1187
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,549
- Well, I'm not saying that you'd want to,

1188
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,750
but if you would want to

1189
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,503
cook some food for the party,

1190
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,240
what would you cook that would be fun?

1191
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,730
- Well, I could make a
hickory smoked turkey

1192
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:46,067
with chestnuts and cranberry stuffing.

1193
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,580
Some ham bites, and some
candied yams and pineapples

1194
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,993
covered all over with marshmallows.

1195
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,850
- Oh.

1196
00:57:00,008 --> 00:57:04,122
- (chuckles) Honey, I'm
gonna knock their socks off.

1197
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:05,693
This is gonna be fun.

1198
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,889
- I'm coming.

1199
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,173
Wait a second. (laughs)

1200
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:15,102
Darnella.

1201
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,599
The girls told me I'd
find you here. (sighs)

1202
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,259
- Hi, Lillian.

1203
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,260
- Hi, darling.

1204
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:27,239
- (sighs) You know, I didn't
know Horace that well,

1205
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,500
but I like to come and visit him.

1206
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,763
Isn't life strange and
wonderful at the same time?

1207
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,113
Because of Horace, I'm about
to have a whole new family.

1208
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,333
- You know, Darnella, you're
a real mensch, you know that?

1209
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,566
- Well, you're the
mensch for giving us the-

1210
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:50,090
- Nah.
- The casino.

1211
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,679
- No.
- Yeah.

1212
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,859
- Business is so lousy,

1213
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,759
the restaurant might as well be closed.

1214
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,289
And I'm not saying just Christmas Eve.

1215
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,090
- What do you mean?
- Well, listen.

1216
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,919
This is between you, me, and
the lamppost, you understand?

1217
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,079
- The lamppost?

1218
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,940
- It's an expression.

1219
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,299
Just ignore the lamppost part.

1220
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,463
Okay, listen.

1221
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,569
I'm giving you a heads up.
- What?

1222
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,520
- We're in trouble.

1223
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:18,739
I mean, the casino, you know the economy.

1224
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,018
And uh, I mean, everybody gets
a bailout but the Kaiyutes,

1225
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:24,359
and I'm the last of the Kaiyutes.

1226
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,229
- Lillian, what are you talking about?

1227
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,155
- (stammering) We're
gonna go out of business.

1228
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:29,989
- Oh my god.

1229
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,409
Are you sure?

1230
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,679
- If we don't turn around
this business in three months,

1231
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,769
the doors to the Kaiyute
Casino will be closed forever.

1232
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,599
And Northern New Mexico can say goodbye

1233
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,523
to fine dining and glamor.

1234
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,453
- Jerry Zee.

1235
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
- What about him?

1236
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,409
- He's your agent, right?
- Well, he used to be.

1237
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,309
He hasn't gotten me a gig in years.

1238
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,489
- Well, who else has he
got? He's still your agent.

1239
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,989
- It's his problem, chica.

1240
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,609
Let him think of something.

1241
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,625
- What else is an agent for?

1242
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:03,459
(buzzing)
(phone ringing)

1243
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,280
- Ah.

1244
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Jerry Zee.

1245
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:11,376
Who?

1246
00:59:12,365 --> 00:59:14,719
Darnella, sweetheart!

1247
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,963
How are ya, baby?

1248
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,349
How's the gig with the Indians?

1249
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,929
Oh, I love it.

1250
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:23,763
Me?

1251
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:25,529
Same old same old.

1252
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,169
What can I tell ya? Vegas.

1253
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,539
Uh, sure I got time.

1254
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,990
What can I do for you, bubby?

1255
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,329
What?

1256
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,139
You're having a baby?

1257
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,249
This is fantastic!

1258
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,083
I didn't think you knew

1259
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:42,239
about the birds and the bees. (laughs)

1260
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,229
Seriously, this is not only fantastic,

1261
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,759
this is miraculous.

1262
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,239
If you're having a baby, sweetheart,

1263
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,009
I can get Ripley's Believe It Or Not.

1264
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:52,359
I can get Unsolved Mysteries.

1265
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,299
They're off the air?

1266
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,140
What do I know?

1267
00:59:55,141 --> 00:59:58,409
I still use a coat hanger
for my rabbit ears.

1268
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,399
Robert Stag died?

1269
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,233
Oh!

1270
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:03,339
I always thought he looked a little stiff,

1271
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,979
but I never would've given him a dead.

1272
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,599
No, no.

1273
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,203
Um, but seriously, we can
make a career out of this.

1274
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,489
Oh, it's not you, it's a kid having a kid.

1275
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:18,739
Oh, too bad, I wanted
to see video. (laughs)

1276
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,449
There goes my fantasy.

1277
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,409
Okay, but seriously, uh,

1278
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,899
there's not much I can do with that,

1279
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,231
it happens all the time, nothing special.

1280
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:28,113
I'm not understanding.

1281
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,339
You're going back to college?

1282
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,959
The kid is gonna go back to college?

1283
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,629
The baby is gonna go to college?

1284
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,030
I'm sorry, I don't get
it, there's no act there.

1285
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,379
Oh, okay.

1286
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,729
Uh, I get it.

1287
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,959
Yes, I see, I see, I see.

1288
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,199
No, yeah.

1289
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,759
I see, I get it.

1290
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,146
You need money to eventually
send the baby to college.

1291
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:53,199
(buzzing)

1292
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,533
Let me think, concept.

1293
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,339
I think I got it.

1294
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,173
No, not that.

1295
01:01:00,174 --> 01:01:02,629
A fly that's been driving me nuts here.

1296
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,879
Where was I?

1297
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,689
Are you still friendly with those cuties?

1298
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:06,523
What's her name?

1299
01:01:06,523 --> 01:01:07,430
Burgundy?

1300
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:08,689
Uh, Bud Lite?

1301
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,969
Shar D'Anay, exactly.

1302
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,810
All right, what we do

1303
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,349
is a showgirls Christmas gift calendar.

1304
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,169
Wait a second, hear me out.

1305
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,119
You, the girls.

1306
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,159
No, listen.

1307
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,489
Cheeky Blaine and his
whole blazing Elvis getup.

1308
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,883
We sell it to all your fans at the casino.

1309
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,359
No, because why?

1310
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,929
The English ladies, they made a calendar,

1311
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,419
they made up, thousands,
millions, am I right?

1312
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,449
A Christmas gift showgirls calendar.

1313
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:40,749
Boom, the perfect gift for daddy.

1314
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,710
Bingo, huh?

1315
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:42,869
It's a winner.

1316
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,689
I will tell you what.

1317
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,179
I will drive up tomorrow

1318
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,749
and personally produce the photo shoot.

1319
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,583
Yeah.

1320
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:51,659
Uh, Cher and Elton are just gonna have

1321
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,779
to handle their own affairs for two days.

1322
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,029
I'll tell ya, sweetheart,

1323
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,159
day and night, they never let up with me.

1324
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,539
It's Cher this and Elton who?

1325
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,029
I love to say, Cher?

1326
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,609
Cher who? (laughs)

1327
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,979
Seriously, enough already.

1328
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,103
Ciao, baby, put on your
warpaint, I'm on my way.

1329
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:12,328
Darnella.

1330
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:15,583
Darnella. (laughs)

1331
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:20,072
Go ahead, live a little
longer, I'm in a good mood.

1332
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,879
(buzzing)

1333
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,029
All right, Darnella, you're
a livin' Christmas tree.

1334
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:25,863
Smile!

1335
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:27,279
Get that, sweetheart.

1336
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,519
Oh yes, you're the biggest surprise

1337
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,509
Santa can bring down the chimney.

1338
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:33,649
It's a family holiday,
but something for Dad,

1339
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,129
do you know what I mean?

1340
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,046
- Showgirl Christmas calendar?
- Yes, please.

1341
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,005
- There you go.

1342
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:39,838
Thank you.

1343
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:40,750
- (laughs) You flirt!

1344
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,583
You devil.

1345
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:43,759
You're gonna have all the
girls' hearts fluttering.

1346
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,083
Okay, go hunt some Easter eggs. (laughs)

1347
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,913
- Here, get your Showgirl
Christmas calendar.

1348
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:56,738
- Where are the Christmas pigs?

1349
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:57,989
I don't get it.

1350
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:19,655
- The Showgirls Christmas Gift Calendar.

1351
01:03:19,656 --> 01:03:20,656
Hmm.

1352
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,739
- Meg, darling, be reasonable, would you?

1353
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,689
It's Christmas Eve,
it's the second busiest

1354
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,049
travel day of the year.

1355
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,949
- So what, Phil?

1356
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,699
You hired a private detective.

1357
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,509
He found this picture on the internet.

1358
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,323
Now we know where she is.

1359
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,703
No, Consuelo.

1360
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,210
Consuela?

1361
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,250
It's my daughter, Phil.

1362
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:56,509
It's my daughter.

1363
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,149
- Darling, I know it's your daughter.

1364
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,169
- Well, you'd feel differently
if it was your daughter.

1365
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,279
- I'd feel exactly the same, Megan.

1366
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,439
Look, we're trying to get
tickets at the last minute

1367
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,729
on Christmas Eve to the nearest airport

1368
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,299
to Kaiyute, New Mexico,

1369
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,649
which happens to be in
Mulechute, Oklahoma.

1370
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,559
It's not exactly easy.

1371
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,013
- No, no, mucho darker.

1372
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,899
I'm sorry, you were saying?

1373
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,239
- I was saying, it's
not as if the airlines

1374
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,619
have staged a bidding war

1375
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,759
to see who puts their hub
in Mulechute, Oklahoma.

1376
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,499
I mean, it's not as if
Mary's life is in any danger.

1377
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,999
- And how do you know that?
- Because it isn't.

1378
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,769
- She's been kidnapped by showgirls.

1379
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,189
- [Phil] Darling, she
hasn't been kidnapped.

1380
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,629
She's smiling in the picture.

1381
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,699
- Oh, but Phil, they
always make them smile

1382
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,439
when they kidnap them, just like Al-Qaeda.

1383
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,059
- They started a college
fund for her, Megan.

1384
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,989
- And that is the most
demeaning thing of all.

1385
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,799
Can you imagine what
our friends would say?

1386
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,789
That we pimped our daughter out

1387
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,479
to a cult of showgirls,

1388
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,019
and can't even pay for our
own grandchild's education?

1389
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,609
Next thing you know they'll be
saying we're on food stamps.

1390
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,959
- Megan, if we go we won't even be able

1391
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,609
to bring her back on a plane.

1392
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,219
She's nine months pregnant.

1393
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,529
No airline would allow it.
- At least we can get her

1394
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,379
out of the clutches of those gypsies.

1395
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,409
It's bad enough that my daughter

1396
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,269
is being held by a band of bimbos,

1397
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,849
but this is now on the internet.

1398
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,169
- Darling, really, I think
you're making too much of this.

1399
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,569
- Do you understand what this means?

1400
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:19,403
- [Phil] Megan-

1401
01:05:19,404 --> 01:05:21,199
- Everybody in the world
is going to be seeing it.

1402
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,865
The next thing you know,
it's gonna be you and me.

1403
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,189
It's, it's terrible, it's awful,

1404
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,399
I can't believe it.

1405
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,123
- Megan, come to your senses.

1406
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,472
- Make the reservations, Phil,

1407
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,573
or I'll charter a jet!

1408
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,682
- [Man On Radio] Trans Prairie Airways,

1409
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:36,673
you are clear to land.

1410
01:05:36,674 --> 01:05:38,831
Did you encounter any
turbulence on the way down?

1411
01:05:38,832 --> 01:05:39,665
- Oh yeah.

1412
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:42,461
Scared the heck out of
a couple of New Yorkers.

Thank God we're safe!

1426
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:28,535

all right, it's all right.

1427

Thank God we're safe.

1429
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,259
- Where is baggage claim?

1430
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,869
- Domestic?
- No, international.

1431
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:40,479
We flew in this dump of an
airplane from Dusseldorf!

1432
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,509
- No need to get surly.

1433
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,089
- Trans Prairie Airways.

1434
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:45,979
- That would be terminal A.

1435
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:49,129
And by the way, that static
electricity in your air

1436
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,805
will probably relax in a couple of hours.

1437

(indistinct)

1441
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,619
- Please check your baggage tags

1442
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,270
against your suitcases,
as many bags look alike.

1443
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,499
(bell dinging)

1444
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,289
Yes?

1445
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,329
- Yes?

1446
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,909
- Can I help you?

1447
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,743
- Yes.

1448
01:07:42,744 --> 01:07:44,266
We reserved a car.

1449
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:45,137
Cutbarth.

1450
01:07:45,138 --> 01:07:46,381

1451
01:07:46,382 --> 01:07:47,840
- Cut?

1452
01:07:47,841 --> 01:07:49,261
- Cut-barth!

1453
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:50,262
Cutbarth!

1454
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,469
- I'll see if I can find your reservation.

1455
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,809
- Find our reservation?

1456
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,343
We are the only people here!

1457
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,950
- I feel like we've landed in Jonestown.

1458
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,139
- That's Cutberth?

1459
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,870
- Cutbarth!

1460
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:11,289
Cutbarth!

1461
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,949
- Is that with an I or with an E?

1462
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:16,599
- Oh, nobody can understand his accent!

1463
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,749
C-U-T-B-A-R-T-H!

1464
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,179
- Charlie University Thomas Bravo Alpha

1465
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,909
Romeo Thomas Hotel, correct?

1466

Yes!

1468
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:37,009

01:11:26,043 --> 01:11:28,059

1508
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,459
- What am I doing here?

1509
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,619
What are you doing here?

1511
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,269

1512
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,029
I could press charges against all of you!

1513

You crazy hormonal bimbos!

Get your hands off my daughter!

1515

- Anybody with hair like that

1516
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,499
shouldn't call anybody a bimbo.

The next one's for you, toots.

1524
01:11:56,755 --> 01:11:58,719

1525
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,449
- Yeah, Phil, feelin' lucky?

1526
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:05,059
- Madam, I think you
should know, I am a lawyer.

1527
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,409
- All the more reason
to shoot, if you ask me.

1528
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,243
- No, Annie.

1529
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:11,939
No, Mom, I wasn't kidnapped.

1530
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,709
I told you I was with
people that care about me,

1531
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,399
people that love me.

1532
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,389

1533
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,809
We do love you, we just express it

(crowd exclaiming)

1535
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,069
- Mary, we want you to come back with us.

1536
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,049
- No, I'm staying here.

1537
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,329
I'm having the baby here.

1538
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,149
I'm keeping the baby, and
I'm raising the baby here.

1539
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:33,329
- In an Indian casino?

1540
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,319
You can't be serious.

1541
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,059
You're just doing this to humiliate us.

1542
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,719
- Mom, this has nothing to do with you.

1543
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,519
This has to do with me and my...

1544
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,520
Oh.

1545
01:12:42,226 --> 01:12:43,059
- Sweetheart, is something wrong?

1546
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:44,059
- The baby.

1547
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,319
- Yes, it's about you and the baby.

1548
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,589
You're absolutely right.

1549
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:50,429
- No, the baby.
- The baby?

1550
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:51,340
- The baby?

1551
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:53,084
- The baby, my water just broke!

1552
01:12:53,085 --> 01:12:54,249
(crowd gasping)

1553
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,130
- God.

1554
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,130
I'm gonna faint.

1555
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:57,459
- No, you're not!

1556
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,979
You put on your big girl panties.

1557
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,834
You're about to become a grandma!

1558
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:01,668
(Megan gasps)

1559
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,139
- All right, don't anyone panic.

1560
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:04,903
I'm an agent, I can handle this.

1561
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,083
Actually, I can't.

1562
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,799
- We've got everything under control.

1563
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,949
Annie, you call the OB-GYN.

1564
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,479
Tell him we're on the way to the hospital.

1565
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,139
I've got everything packed, we're ready.

1566
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,116
Let's go.

1570
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,079
The contractions are starting.

1571
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,999
- It's okay, it's okay.

1572
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1573
01:13:56,819 --> 01:13:57,879
Come on, you can do it.

1574
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,547
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

1575
01:14:00,419 --> 01:14:01,879
Come on, sweetheart, you can do it.

1576
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,268
- [Mary And Darnella] Ho-ho.

1577
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:07,708
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
(sirens blaring)

1578
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,792
Oh, the cops.

1579
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,430
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1580
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:22,380
Hee-hee-hee.

1581
01:14:25,584 --> 01:14:27,084
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1582
01:14:29,312 --> 01:14:30,645
Hee-hee-hee-hee.

1583
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,907
- You got the whole Christmas
party with you, huh?

1584
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:40,566
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1585
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:42,309
- Ho-ho-ho, but it's not funny.

1586
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,779
You were doing 80 miles an hour

1587
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,560
in a 45 mile an hour zone.

1588
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:47,019
- Well, you don't understand, officer,

1589
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,729
she's in labor, she's gonna have a baby.

1590
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:51,399
The water broke, and we're
on the way to the hospital.

1591
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,119
- Well, then you're lucky I stopped you.

1592
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,309
The bridge is collapsed up ahead.

1593
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,139
You can't get through to the hospital.

1594
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,573
- What are you talking about?
- Just what I said.

1595
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,499
Hey!

1596
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,859
You're the girl from the calendar.

1597
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,339
I love that calendar!

1598
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,468
We have that up in the sheriff's office.

1599
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:08,975
- Oh, you are so sweet!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1600
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:10,910
- I'm so happy you like it.

1601
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:13,334
We had the nicest time.
- Ho-ho-ho.

1602
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:14,335
- Oh, right.

1603
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,669
Well, how can we get across?

1604
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,409
- Well, unless you wanna swim across,

1605
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,682
the nearest other hospital is Farmington.

1606
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,089
- But it's 45 miles away.

1607
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,279
- Well, it's either there or right here.

1608
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,113
Come on, follow me.

1609
01:15:25,114 --> 01:15:26,492
I'll get you there in no time.

1610
01:15:26,493 --> 01:15:28,507
- Ho-ho-ho-ho.
- Ho.

1611
01:15:29,384 --> 01:15:32,055
- Ho-hee-hee-hee.

(Mary groaning)

1614
01:15:45,883 --> 01:15:47,046
Hang in there.

1615
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:49,039
- I'm hanging in, but this baby wants out!

1616
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,012
(groaning)

1617
01:15:52,013 --> 01:15:54,076
It's coming now!
- Oh dear.

1618
01:15:54,077 --> 01:15:55,731
Oh dear.

1619
01:15:55,732 --> 01:15:56,931
No, no!
- Oh!

01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,023

My sweet angel.

01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:45,650
I just...

1680
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:49,410
I wanna thank you for being
so wonderful to my daughter.

1681
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:53,610
- All right.

1682
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,323
Give your baby one more hug.

1683
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,199
Then I wanna place her on an incubator.

1684
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,033
- Huh?

1685
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:03,653
- It's just a precaution, it's normal.

1686
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:05,699
- Wow.

1687
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,343
- Big time wow.

1688
01:19:11,048 --> 01:19:13,548
(baby cooing)

1689
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,480
- Okay.

1690
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,313
Let me have her.

1691
01:19:18,314 --> 01:19:20,413
We'll have her back to you in a few hours.

1692
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,300
Wave bye.

1693
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,680
Now, Mary.

1694
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,819
The hospital's filled to capacity tonight,

1695
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,169
so I'm gonna ask you if
you could share a room

1696
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,599
with another young woman

1697
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,327
who went into labor this evening.

1698
01:19:41,328 --> 01:19:42,986
- Why does she have to share a room?

1699
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:44,599
- That's fine, I don't mind.

1700
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,653
- Well, it's not really your
daughter I'm concerned about.

1701
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,209
This young woman's baby was stillborn.

1702
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,839
Now, normally we'd put
her in a private room,

1703
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,859
but we won't be able to move
her until tomorrow morning.

1704
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,549
So, I'm gonna ask you,

1705
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:02,179
please nurse your baby in
the hallway out of deference.

1706
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,053
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1707
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,613
- Well, maybe they'll be
able to have more children.

1708
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,409
- No.

1709
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,419
They won't.

1710
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,133
Unfortunately, she won't be
able to have any more children.

1711
01:20:46,827 --> 01:20:51,827
- Monkey pillow. (chuckles)

1712
01:20:55,221 --> 01:20:56,285
You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1713
01:20:56,286 --> 01:20:57,286
- All right.

1714
01:21:00,749 --> 01:21:01,953
- I love you, too.

1715
01:21:01,954 --> 01:21:03,037
- Oh my gosh.

1716
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,739
- We just heard.

1717
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,693
We are so sorry for your loss.

1718
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,360
- It's just, you know,

1719
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,080
we waited so long, and,

1720
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:25,753
he never even took a breath. (sobbing)

1721
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,063
How's your baby?
- She's fine.

1722
01:21:35,322 --> 01:21:36,322
- I'm glad.

1723
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,975
I'm really glad.

1724
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:43,953
I'm really happy for you, it's just.

1725
01:21:43,954 --> 01:21:48,714
I can't do it. (sobbing)

1726
01:21:48,715 --> 01:21:50,715
- Excuse us.
- Of course.

1727
01:21:57,439 --> 01:21:59,856
(slow music)

1728
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,103
(muffled speaking over intercom)

1729
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:09,191
- Oh.

1730
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:16,293
(laughs)

1731
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,733
- I thought I would find you

1732
01:23:34,734 --> 01:23:36,543
when I didn't see you in your room.

1733
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,699
Are you sure you're supposed
to be walking around?

1734
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,533
- Yeah, 16.

1735
01:23:40,533 --> 01:23:41,533
Resilient.

1736
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,333
This is so amazing.

1737
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:51,010
- It is that.

1738
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,763
Just amazing.

1739
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,953
- I mean, about how everything
turned out, you know?

1740
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,839
My mother here, with Phil.

1741
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,159
They're being really nice.

1742
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,883
I mean, you talk about miracles.

1743
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,990
And the way you took me in.

1744
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,350
And everything.

1745
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,749
I don't think I've ever had so many people

1746
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:17,813
who were like family.

1747
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,463
It's what I wanted most in life.

1748
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,343
A big family, everyone's
laughing, holidays.

1749
01:24:28,343 --> 01:24:30,463
It couldn't have turned out
better if it was planned.

1750
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,130
- Maybe it was.

1751
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,293
- What do you mean?
- Well, just that.

1752
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:40,353
I think there is a plan,

1753
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,333
even though sometimes we don't see it,

1754
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:46,119
even though we're too close to it

1755
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,423
to make it out clearly.

1756
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,270
I still think there's a plan.

1757
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,320
- Wasn't much of a plan
for Barbara and Joe.

1758
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,260
- I don't know.

1759
01:24:58,172 --> 01:24:59,939
- What are you talking about?

1760
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,252
They waited all that time for a baby.

1761
01:25:02,253 --> 01:25:04,009
They're like the perfect couple,

1762
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:05,803
they have everything ready.

1763
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,420
And they'll go home to an empty house.

1764
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,010
Here I am.

1765
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:15,060
I've never even thought
about having a kid.

1766
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,410
Not much of a plan, if you ask me.

1767
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:23,590
- Let's sit down.

1768
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,509
Remember when I told you

1769
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:36,663
that when I was just a
little bit older than you,

1770
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:42,043
almost 18, that I had a baby of my own?

1771
01:25:43,767 --> 01:25:44,767
A little girl.

1772
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:50,720
A perfect, beautiful, magical little girl.

1773
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:56,230
- What happened?

1774
01:25:57,842 --> 01:26:01,369
Did she, uh, did she
get sick or something?

1775
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:02,693
- No, thank goodness.

1776
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:06,533
But I realized that I was 17,

1777
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:10,233
single, and a showgirl.

1778
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,750
Truth was that I was...

1779
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,893
I had a baby, but I wasn't
ready to be a mother.

1780
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,873
Not the kind of mother that she deserved.

1781
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,409
And then I remembered
what my grandma said.

1782
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:27,410
- What?

1783
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,103
- She said that when you love someone,

1784
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,453
you love them with an open hand,

1785
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:40,137
not clutching, not like a fist, but open,

1786
01:26:44,183 --> 01:26:47,903
because the greatest act
of love that anyone can do

1787
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:51,230
is to let go.

1788
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:58,360
I always wondered how
my daughter turned out.

1789
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,633
She went to a good home,

1790
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:07,099
to a loving couple who weren't able

1791
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,613
to have children of their own.

1792
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,333
But they were far more ready
than I was to be a parent.

1793
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,063
I know how I would've liked
her to turn out, Mary.

1794
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:28,217
I would've liked her to be

1795
01:27:29,706 --> 01:27:31,123
exactly like you.

1796
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:52,113
- I wanna give the baby up for adoption.

1797
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:57,623
I wanna give her up to the
couple whose baby was stillborn.

1798
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:04,073
They're wonderful people,
who'll make wonderful parents.

1799
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,293
It's not my choice alone,

1800
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:11,460
'cause she's your grandchild

1801
01:28:12,706 --> 01:28:14,506
and you have to deal with this, too.

1802
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:30,310
My baby deserves someone

1803
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,190
that's not just ready to be a parent,

1804
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:35,703
but knows how to be a parent,

1805
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,030
knows how to be a mother.

1806
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,270
And I'm not

1807
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:47,253
'cause I never learned it from you, Mom.

1808
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,670
- Mary-

1809
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:52,820
- Please let me finish.

1810
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,793
I never learned from you

1811
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:59,253
what a mother was supposed to be like.

1812
01:29:01,429 --> 01:29:02,450
And I want that.

1813
01:29:03,717 --> 01:29:05,173
I want that very much.

1814
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,929
So, when I do have kids

1815
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:12,199
I can take care of them.

1816
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,896
I'll know what a mother looks like,

1817
01:29:13,897 --> 01:29:16,259
and what she feels like,

1818
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,989
and you're the only person in the world

1819
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,283
that can give that to me.

1820
01:29:20,349 --> 01:29:21,712
And I'm the only person in the world

1821
01:29:21,713 --> 01:29:23,192
that can show you what it feels like

1822
01:29:23,193 --> 01:29:25,183
when a daughter loves you.

1823
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:28,370
I wanna go home.

1824
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:32,533
But not to some boarding school.

1825
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:37,562
And I wanna be your loving
daughter, and I'm not.

1826
01:29:37,563 --> 01:29:40,773
And I want you to be more than
someone who gave birth to me.

1827
01:29:42,898 --> 01:29:44,593
And right now, you're not.

1828
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:48,003
And that's awful.

1829
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:51,101
And I don't want it to
be like that anymore.

1830
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,050
- Mary, maybe you should run
away from home more often.

1831
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,100
It's good for you.
