00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,692

191
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,903

00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:21,906
You ever tried it?

200
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,243
What's it do?

201
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,179
[Jason] Whatever you

202
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,962

I don't think he wore a condom.

225
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,106

- No.
- No, ma'am.

255
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,283
I heard their neighbors

00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,675
I haven't passed the test yet.

267
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,444
I spoke to the Dean of
Admissions at Evergreen.

We'll get your transcript
sent up there.

Not yet.

- Look--
- Okay.

293

I'm sorry, okay?

298
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,332
It's just
I have a lot on my mind

299
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,701
and like I still have
a shit ton to do

300
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,603
and then my mom just wants
to hang out with me--

301
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,739
That shit is whatever, that
shit doesn't matter, okay?

302
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,245
- Doesn't matter?
- Doesn't matter.

303

You know, it's whatever, it's
just my fucking life, right?

00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,854
I don't know if you know this,

306
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,723
but for the past couple of days,

307
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:30,795
I've just been like
steadily freaking out inside

308
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:35,967
and, you know, like all I can
think is that I want

309
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,703
to be an engineer,
I want to be an engineer,

310
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,404
- like I want to make things--
- I know.

311
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,740
I know, but do you know
any engineers?

312
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,976
I don't know, no?

313
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,310
I don't fucking know what

314
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,612
an engineer even fucking does.

315
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,413
Fucking exactly right?
So it's like

316
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,916
I sound stupid because
it's what I want to do,

317
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,251
but I don't know how to do it

318
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,385
and then like I start to get

319
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,686

I can't, I can't stay.

325
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:11,302
I have to go, I have to go

335
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,566

336
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:46,037
I'm trying to tell you something important to me like it's important to me.

337
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,472

340
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:59,917
No you can't because I need to be there

341
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,757
What are you trying to say?

342
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,928
Say it.

343

I want a break.

344
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,515

I need to ask you a
couple of questions,

355
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,047
make sure it's safe for you.

356
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,852
[Examiner] You have 90 minutes
to complete the exam.

357
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:14,725
Wait until I give direction
to turn your packet over.

358
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,705
Turn the fuck around.

359
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,408
Can I go to the bathroom?

360
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,778
What is your normal form
of contraception?

361
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,546
Yaz.

362
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:38,482
And how many hours since you
last had unprotected sex?

363
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,419
I don't, it was last night.

364
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,887
So like 12 hours?

365
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,989
Uh, yeah, how much is it?

366
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,558
[Pharmacist] Have you
had any health issues,

367
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,660
pain or burning
during urination,

368
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:53,063
- abdominal pain pain during or after sex?
- No, can I pay?

369
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,832
These questions are
for your safety.

370
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:56,567
I'm fine, can I pay?

371
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,437
Turn your packet over and begin.

372
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,164
It is 76 dollars.

373
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,303
76.

374
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,070
[Pharmacist] Do you want
to use cash or card?

375
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,608
All right, okay, I think
I'm going to just have to,

376
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,676
I'm going to come back.

377
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,017
Shit.

378
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,852
[Mrs. Ellison] Tanya Briggs,

379
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,654
- what do you think you're doing?

380
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:24,922
We were just going
to the bathroom.

381
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,123
Tanya, you really want detention

382
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,260
- today of all days?
- No.

383
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,061
So, what were you doing?

384
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,531
Okay, she's a fucking ho,
all right?

385
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,765
Tanya, language.

386
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,067
- No, she--
- She pulled my hair.

387
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,270
- No one touched your ratchet-y ass hair.
- Yes you did.

388
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:40,871
Oh my God, okay I was
sitting in class

389
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:41,972
and she fucking starts
turning around

390
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:42,940
and grilling me and shit.

391
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,275
So what?

392
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,243
So she kicked my chair.

393
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,178
No I didn't, she
kicked my chair.

394
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,680
Stop, just stop.

395
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,117
Is something funny?

396
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,718
No.

397
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,187
Yeah, I didn't think so.

398
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,024
Back to class.

399
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,025
Both of you.

400
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,061
Let's go.

401
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,302
[Lana] Come on.

402
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:13,070
All right.

403
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,110
[Sighs] Damn.

404
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,118
Hey.

405
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:33,757
What's wrong?

406
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,692
Nothing.

407
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,061
Just get in the car.

408
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:41,165
Alright,
but look at what I got you.

409
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,767
They didn't have the nasty
cherry ones that you like.

410
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,937
- [Candace] Did you just pocket these?
- What?

411
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,907
- Did you just pocket these?
- Bitch, I can't hear you.

412
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,875
I said did you just
pocket these?

413
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,344
No, I bought them.

414
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,849
[Bell rings]

415
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,718
[Teacher] You can email me
essay corrections.

416
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,119
If you're taking my
class in the fall,

417
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,822
I suggest you do
the corrections.

418
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,290
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

419
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,034
[Lana] I don't think
you should feel bad

420
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,936
just 'cause he crying about it.

421
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,838
He wasn't crying about it.

422
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,673
I'm fucking with you.

423
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,808
I know.

424
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,078
He did cry though.

425
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,346
Damn.

426
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,714
[Boy] Hey Candace.

427
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,851
You coming
to the keg party tonight?

428
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,319
Yeah, we'll be there.

429
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,954
Can't wait.

430
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,722
Okay, see you tonight.

431
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,760
[Candace] You are so mean.

432
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:43,827
Fuck him.

433
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,063
Babyface looking ass.

434
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,402
Ryan, how'd it go?

435
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,059
[Intense music]

436
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,103
Ryan.

437
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,105
Talk to me.

438
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,846
[Willy] The fuck?

439
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,882
- Shit, shit.
- Hey, Willy.

440
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,350
I didn't do anything.

441
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,454
Shit. Shit!

442
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,460
The fuck?

443
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,129
Get the fuck up.

444
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:29,099
I didn't fucking do anything.
What do you think the fuck you're doing?

445
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,235
You're a fucking skank.

446
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,036
Stop it.

447
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,375
[Ryan] Tanya.

448
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:41,779
Fuck.

449
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,267
[Girl] Get off!

450
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,915
Ryan, stop, stop, stop.
Come on.

451
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,289
Get back to class.

452
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,356
Show's over.

453
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,482
[Officer] Tell me what happened.

454
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:56,553
[Girls talking over each other]

455
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,423
[officer] One at a time.

456
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,092
You, go

457
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,461
Oh, okay.

458
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,131
Well, I was in the parking lot
uhm, with Lana.

459
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,166
[Officer] Which one's Lana?

460
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,203
Okay, keep going.

461
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,907
Okay, so yeah, we're by my car

462
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,309
and then we see Willy--

463
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,411
- I'm Willy.
- [Officer] Great.

464
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:25,048
Yeah okay, so we see Willy
and then Tanya--

465
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,583
And Tanya was trying to
kick my ass last night too.

466
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,486
[Officer] Let's just stick
to today, okay girls?

467
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,356
Okay yeah, so Tanya
comes out of nowhere

468
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,424
and she just starts
punching her.

469
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,493
- [Officer] Punching who?
- Me, she fucking punched me.

470
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,964
[Officer] Watch the mouth.
So she's punching her?

471
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,333
- Yeah, she just starts punching her.
- And she kicked me too.

472
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,636
- Yep, I saw her kick Willy.
- [Officer] So now she's kicking people?

473
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:48,238
Yeah, and she pulled my hair,
ask Mrs. Ellison.

474
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,044
So she's punching and
kicking Willy and, uhm, Ryan,

475
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,415
Ryan comes in and,
uh, she's like.

476
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,251
Ryan tried to stop it, she
jumped in to try to stop it

477
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,920
and then Tanya punched her too.

478
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,621
[Officer] So Tanya's
just hitting everybody?

479
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,124
[Girls talking over each other]

480
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,626
[officer] Ryan beat
Tanya Briggs pretty bad.

481
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:12,996
It doesn't matter.

482
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,699
Ryan didn't throw
the first punch.

483
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:20,270
[Arguing in the distance]

484
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,532
Fuck man, Sylvia's going
to fucking kill her.

485
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,334
It ain't my fault.

486
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,301
[Candace] I didn't say it was.

487
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,136
Fuck, that was fucked.

488
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,538
[Candace] I know, did
you see the pee?

489
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,673
It was like she was
fucking dead man.

490
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,210
Oh, I got your money.

491
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:03,046
The lady asked a bunch
of fucking questions too.

492
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,047
Like what?

493
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,248
Shit, I don't remember.

494
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,017
Fucking Cory.

495
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,485
[Willy] You told her?

496
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,756
- How short are you?
- 50 bucks.

497
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:17,394
- 51 bucks and why don't you just ask Cory for it?
- [Willy] No.

498
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,133
Okay let's go.

499
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,660
Fuck! Stop mom.

500
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:54,064
[Sylvia] I swear to God,
I swear to God.

501
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,073
They're going to sue me.

502
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:07,344
They're not coming after you,
you're a child.

503
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,148
They're coming after me, did
you even think about that?

504
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:14,317
I am not losing everything
because of you.

505
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:16,486
I'm not losing my apartment.

506
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,696
I want you out.

507
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,232
I want you gone,
I want you to leave.

508
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,371
I will go down to
the courthouse,

509
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:37,240
and I will get the papers,
and I will talk to a judge.

510
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,752
[Laughing]

511
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,680
[Candace] Okay, okay,
come on let's go.

512
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:18,415
Cory's not even home.

513
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,351
I promise you he's home,
we're getting your 50 bucks.

514
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,853
51 bucks.

515
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:25,589
It's fine, I don't need
the fucking money.

516
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:26,857
What do you mean, no,
no, no, no, no.

517
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,859
He busted in you,
he can pay for it.

518
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,327
Exactly.

519
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,428
What all of a sudden you two are

520
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,796
a couple of fucking feminists?

521
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,532
Excuse me, you know it's
the right thing.

522
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:36,867
Are you doing it or am I?

523
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,541
- [Candace] Double time boo-boo, let's go.
- [Lana] Love you.

524
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,895
- Hey.
- Hey, Cory.

525
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:06,663
What's going on?

526
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,534
Uh, not much, Ryan just beat
the shit out of Tanya.

527
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,635
- Oh.
- Yeah.

528
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,305
- [Chuckles nervously]
- [Cory] Okay.

529
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,276
You going to
the kickback tonight?

For sure, yeah, yeah.

531
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:23,613
Okay, you know if you
want a ride or something,

532
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,649
bro's going to let me
borrow his truck.

533
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:29,619
- Okay, yeah, I just wanted to ask--
- I can pick you up you know,

534
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:33,723
or he's going to get some beers
and some hard A too, you know.

535
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:34,658
Cool.

536
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,963
Uh... Hey, I was
just wondering if you...

537
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,298
What's up?

538
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
- I, uhm...
- Everything okay?

539
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:44,234
Yeah.

540
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,336
Uh, no.

541
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,540
I, uh--
It's just that did you--

542
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:55,679
uhm, did you come inside me
last night?

543
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,614
[Cory] What?

544
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,952
[Willy] It's not
a big deal, I just--

545
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:07,691
I don't really remember
and uhm, yeah, so...

546
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,462
Yeah, I mean, I think, maybe.

547
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,398
I didn't have a condom so.

548
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,499
No, I know.

549
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,336
Uhm, are you on birth control
or anything?

550
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,505
Not really, I mean, no.

551
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,742
But I was going to
get the Plan B.

552
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,644
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

553
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:33,416
Yeah, yeah it is, but I don't
exactly have the cash, so...

554
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,318
How much do you need?

555
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:41,324
I just need like 50 bucks, or
51, 51 would be awesome, so.

556
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,561
Yeah, I don't--
I don't think I have that.

557
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,831
Okay, no, I just
wanted to check.

558
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,400
Sorry, I think I've got
like you know, 10 on me.

559
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:51,968
[Willy] It's okay.

560
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,805
- Hold on, one second.
- Okay, uhm... Jesus.

561
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,315
Here.

562
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:10,587
No, this is great, thank you.

563
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:11,921
[Cory] Sorry.

564
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,357
It's okay, thank you, really.

565
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,627
But I will see you tonight.

566
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,429
For sure, yeah.

567
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,465
- Bye.
- Bye.

568
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:23,833
Bye!

569
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,341
What did he say?

570
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,777
- He said sorry.
- And?

571
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,912
He gave me 10 bucks.

572
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,081
- Ten bucks?
- Fuck that.

573
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,082
No, no.

574
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,052
Can we just go now, it's fine.

575
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,586
What do you mean?

576
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,988
I mean he said he's broke.

577
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:50,493
Oh he said he's--
did he say he was broke?

578
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,663
He lives in the fucking Heights,
they all got money here.

579
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,932
Just let it fucking go,
let's go.

- Nope.
- Lana, what are you doing?

581
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,538
- Get him, Lana.
- Lana, don't.

583
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:16,753
- Is Cory home?
- [Cory's mom] No.

584
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:20,357
- Okay, thank you.
- No, no, no, no.

585
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,459
[Cory's mom] Do you
want to leave a message?

586
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:23,993
- No.
- Yes.

587
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,796
Could you tell him he should
wear a condom

588
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,665
the next time he decides to
come inside a drunk girl?

589
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:30,834
What did you say?

590
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:33,436
You know what, thank you
so much for your time.

591
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:36,406
- Have a great day, bye!

OK, relax, it's never fucking
mattered before.

595
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,035
You didn't have to do that.

596
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,703
[Candace] Oh chill out,

597
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,705
little Cory will talk
his way out of that shit.

598
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,073
Seriously.

Okay, whose got this?

I'm broke.

I got this shit.

602
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,578
Fuck, dude, this is stupid,
I fucking told you.

603
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,112
I said we shouldn't
shoulder tap in the Heights,

604
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,113
we got a meter running.

605
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,482
[Candace] Go ahead then.

606
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,983
I did it last night.

607
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,185
[Willy] I'm not allowed
in there, so I'm out.

608

It's got to be you, honey.

609
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:33,823
- [Willy] Come on, Cherry.
- No, no I'm doing it.

610
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,060
Come on. Yeah, come on, this is
our last night together.

611
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:39,562
[Candace] No, because
I have never stolen

612
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,965
anything in my life and I'm
not going to start that now.

613
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,667
- That's exactly why you should be the one to do it.
- No, no I'm not.

614
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,069
You're leaving here
tomorrow, so.

615
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,004
Exactly, it doesn't
even matter for you.

616
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,939
[Candace] It does matter to me,
it's important to me.

617
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,808
I'm not going to do it, I
would do anything for you guys

618

I'm just not going
to steal for you.

00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:46,862
No.

705
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:49,732
So how do you know?

706
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:57,907
Okay, okay.

707
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,577
We don't have to talk about it.

708
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,948
Do you want to know
what I did today?

709
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:08,985
What?

710
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,419
- I just stole two cases of beer.
- What?

711
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,589
I stole two cases of beer,
like I walked right in,

712
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:17,560
I grabbed two cases, I ran past
the guy who worked there

713
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:18,861
and I jumped in the car and then

714
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,496
Lana just drove fucking off.

715
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:28,837
Okay.

716
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,343
So then, what's going on?

717
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:35,444
Nothing, Cherry.

718
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:39,815
[Candace] I don't believe you.

719
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,351
Okay, well...

720
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:43,986
- Dude, fuck off.
- You fuck off.

721
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:46,689
- No, tell me, talk to me.
- Cherry, he fucked me.

722
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,526
- What?
- Okay, Cherry, fuck.

723
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:53,929
I did it.

724
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,864
What do you mean,
what did you do?

725
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:58,534
She kicked me out.

726
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,771
She said I had to leave,
I had to get emancipated

727
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:03,706
or some shit.

728
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,908
Who your mom-- your mom?

729
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,943
And I went home.

730
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,745
[Candace] Okay.

731
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,715
And Jason was there.

732
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:21,724
He helped me with my hand and,
and then he was on--

733
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,294
I don't fucking know I
was just fucking numb.

734
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:28,864
And then his pants were down
and I'm on the couch and--

735
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:37,606
I couldn't-- I didn't
fucking know, I was--

736
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,613
And then she came in and saw us.

737
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,653
It's not like they were
going to get married

738
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,755
or anything either,
he's a guy, you know?

739
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,691
He's just another fucking guy.

740
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:04,733
Are you...
I mean, are you okay?

741
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,779
I want to do something.

742
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,982
- Cherry.
- No listen.

743
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:23,319
I have an idea, I want
to do something, okay?

744
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,087
- Before we go to this party.
- Cherry, I don't--

745
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,922
- Listen, no, no, listen, listen.
- I'm really not,

746
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:30,092
- I don't feel like even leaving now.
- I hear you.

747
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,530
I hear you, I just wanted--

748
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,632
- Fine.
- Okay.

749
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,034
Okay, just trust me on this.

750
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,437
Grab that fucking hat.

751
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,352
Just follow me, okay?

752
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:58,987
I'm taking this.

753
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:16,472
- Cherry.
- Shut up.

754
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,613
Just trust me, okay.

755
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,815
You're going to like it.

756
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,687
Okay, come on.

757
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,627
[Ryan] What are we doing?

758
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:39,962
Just, hold on.

759
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:46,802
- Okay, stay here.
- Why?

760
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:50,639
Just stand here and put this on.

761
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:52,941
Just put it on.

762
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:03,886
Okay.

763
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,069
Dear admissions committee,

764
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:25,741
as a counselor at a low
income magnet school

765
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:28,043
at a dilapidated fourth
plane district

766
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:30,045
of Vancouver, Washington,

767
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:33,115
I have seen my fair share
of troubled students.

768
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,953
Children plunging head first
down disastrous paths

769
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,155
despite my best efforts
to steer them

770
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:43,525
toward a future that
involves steady employment,

771
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:48,096
a craft or trade in some
cases, maybe even college.

772
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,535
I found Ryan Reese amongst
predictably bleak circumstances.

773
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:54,803
- Cherry, don't--
- Let me just--

774
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,507
Let me just read this, okay?

775
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,113
If we were judged by the
worst things we had done,

776
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:08,183
then we would be probably
all be considered bad people.

777
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:13,255
If you looked at Ryan's
transcript or,

778
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:14,656
she's says rap sheet,

779
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:18,861
then you might be inclined
to dismiss her.

780
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,263
Another person in a long list

781
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:24,533
that has attempted to
exclude this young woman

782
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:27,002
from one of her many
quiet goals.

783
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:31,006
What you don't see
in that transcript

784
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,208
is a vulnerable young woman.

785
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,112
Vulnerable to the demands of
a single parent household.

786
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:41,617
Vulnerable to
the psychological distress

787
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,954
that accompanies a black eye
and she has had many.

788
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,260
Vulnerable to a school district

789
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:53,128
that offers a fraction
of the tools

790
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,163
that a student who
is blessed enough

791
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,066
to live just
five miles east has.

792
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:02,738
She is vulnerable,
not because she is weak.

793
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,707
Her vulnerability
is her strength.

794
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,144
Despite the obstacles
stacked against her,

795
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,214
she arrives at the front doors
of East Vancouver High

796
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:14,683
and she fights for herself.

797
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,718
She fights for something better.

798
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:19,588
So...

799
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,926
While many students will
arrive unbridled

800
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:26,295
to your university,
anxious to partake

801
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:28,830
in the celebration to
discover one's self,

802
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:33,101
this woman will be
striving for a better life.

803
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:37,573
And what could possibly be
more honorable than that?

804
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,076
I write this as
a proud faculty member,

805
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,312
reminding myself that
she is the reason

806
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:46,114
that I come to school each day.

807
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:52,254
She gives me a better life,
more fulfilled life.

808
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:57,125
And I know that she can do
that for your college also.

809
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,361
Sincerely, Doctor Ellison.

810
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:16,845
[Chuckles] Ryan Reese, please
come accept your diploma.

811
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:29,057
- I love you.
- I love you.

812
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:33,328
Now do you want to go to
this shit hole party, or?

813
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,065
- Yeah.
- [Both laughs]

01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,149
[party music blaring]

816
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:33,755
- Cory!
- [Indistinct chatter]

817
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:50,806
Dude, you fucked that bitch up.
I couldn't fucking believe it.

818
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:53,375
She's like crying and like
pissing all over herself.

819
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,277
It wasn't like that.

820
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:58,146
Bull fucking shit, Ryan,
I saw that.

821
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,415
Hey, hey are you with Lana?

822
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,050
Sure.

823
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,086
Wait, I thought that
she brought you here.

824
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:07,823
Let's just take shots,
come, come, come. [Indistinct]

825

[car horn honking]

826
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:27,909
- Oh my God, do you want this?
- I don't want it.

827
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,083
God, fuck.

828
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,351
- What?
- My mom.

829
01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:38,253
You want to go?

830
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,856
No just, I'll be back.

831
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:01,336
Hey.

832
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:03,238
Hey.

833
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:45,213
- Hey, uhm, do you have that lipstick?
- Oh yeah.

834
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:50,952
- You good?
- Yeah, can I leave?

835
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,320
Yeah.

836
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,456
Okay, I'm going
to go in the morning.

837
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,423
What time.

838
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:57,092
Like eight.

839
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:59,427
Okay, have fun.

840
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,109
Oh my God.

841
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:21,616
- You good?
- Mhm.

842
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:27,956
- Yeah, I heard something.
- [Ryan] What?

843
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:32,560
I heard you kicked
the shit out of Tanya.

844
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,034
Yeah, you know she used to be friends with my older sister, right?

845
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,603
I remember when I was like 12,

846
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:44,172
she came into my room
while I was sleeping

847
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:49,577
- and just like started pulling my hair like a psycho.
- What the fuck?

848
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:52,981
Yeah, I mean she could
probably beat my ass, so

849
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:55,517
I'm glad you did it.

850
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,621
You get in trouble?

851
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:01,690
Yeah.

852
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,625
Fuck.

853
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,329
So what about college?

854
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,168
I don't know.

855
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:16,071
Well, I guess you don't have to.

856
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:17,072
My brother didn't.

857
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,607
He didn't know what he
really wanted to do

858
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,543
so he just joined the army.

859
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,345
Said the army was full of people

860
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:25,347
who didn't know what
they wanted to do.

861
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,415
Just a bunch of like
dipshits and stuff.

862
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,751
Well, I don't want
to go in the army.

863
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:32,153
Nah, that's not what I'm saying.

864
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,457
It's all right.

865
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,659
You know I probably should
go in the fucking army.

866
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:40,462
I don't know.

867
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:46,434
I thought about doing like hairdressing school or something.

868
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,472
I just think it would be
better than working at a

869
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:53,308
Wendy's or something.

870
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,512
I'm keeping it a secret though.

871
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,446
Why?

872
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:03,284
Because it's just for me.

873
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:06,554
Okay.

874
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:11,126
So you got secrets now.

875
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,332
I'll tell you another one.

876
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:20,568
All right.

877
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:24,039
I've never kissed anyone.

878
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:25,740
What?

879
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:29,377
I mean I've never just
kissed someone, like

880
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,146
just a kiss.

[Techno music]

882
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:24,099
Hey Willy, it's me, I'm just

883
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:27,769
trying to figure out
where you are, so

884
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,238
give me a call back, okay?

885
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:38,279
[Willy] What are you doing?

886
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,817
It's okay, yeah, you're sexy.

887
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:47,856
- Shh...
- You're a freak dude.

888
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:53,795
What did you do,
what did you do?

889
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:57,365
- [Chuckles]
- No.

890
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:01,536
I just want to see, just
a second, just a second.

891
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,705
No, no, no way.

892
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:08,176
So, I think maybe these need
to come off a little bit.

893
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:36,838
- Wait.
- What?

894
01:09:39,543 --> 01:09:43,878
You said you wanted to break up,
you said you want to move on and go do other things or.

895
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,816
Yeah. But I want to.

896
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,796
I'm going to put it
on for you, okay?

897
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,360
Well like, I got to
get going anyway.

898
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:34,729
My mom gave me a curfew.

899
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,298
She's over at that
Olive Garden on Milplane.

900

Wait, seriously?

901
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:40,802
- Yeah.
- I fucking love that place.

902
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,470
I went there for
Homecoming once,

903
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:45,540
I swear I had like 30
of those breadsticks.

904
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:47,575
Yeah, I always make
her bring me those.

905
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,410
- So good.
- And the Chicken Alfredo.

I don't know.

938
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,525
Like, you're just
going to roam the streets, or?

939
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:54,162
No, stupid I'm not just
going to roam the streets.

- 'Cause look, my mom's inside

- and I can sneak you in right here through the side door.
- That's okay.

Just go right here, and I can sneak you in.

it back, I just--

I want you to know.

949
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:42,904

I can't stay here.

take the GED test?

Doesn't matter.

You could always take it again.

959
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:19,040
I'm not going to.

960
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:26,847
Can I sleep here tonight?

never comes in here?

if she does.

suits to work, or what?

on my bed if you want,

987
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,089

990
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,435
So did you have
Mrs. Lane for English?

991
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,204
For like a minute.
But I had to switch out though,

992
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:40,107
- I kept falling asleep in her class.
- Yeah, me too.

993
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,843
Honestly, I could
fall asleep anywhere.

994
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:49,550

995
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:53,988

- Dude, what the fuck.
- [Chuckles]

1003
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:16,297
Why would you not get a bag?

1004
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:18,265
- This was more fun.
- I don't know.

1005
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,034
Okay, give me one second.

01:22:24,941 --> 01:22:26,206
Yes, I do.

1008
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:29,576
Are you okay?

1009
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,546
- I puked.
- Oh, yeah?

1010
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:35,516

last night?

Guys, I-- I gotta go.

1014
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,032
Well, okay.

- I'm fine.

- Okay, I gotta go.
- Okay.

[Girls] Goodbye! Bye.

1023
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,610
I was thinking about
cousin Nikola.

1024
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:52,319
I couldn't sleep last night, 'cause I was...
thinking so much about her.

1025
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,823
[Sighs]

1026
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:57,858
I don't know how
she just got so...

1027
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:02,262
used up by life.

1028
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:11,638
She used to come around
and ask for 10, 20 bucks.

1029
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,675
Like I got any money.

1030
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:20,848
She just wanted to smoke it up.

1031
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:26,286
And she was getting beat up
so bad by that Robert guy.

1032
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,423
But she wouldn't leave him.

1033
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:37,464
And then she lost her job
at the cement company.

1034
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:41,301
Do you remeber that?

1035
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:48,408
I didn't even think you could
be a woman and do that job.

1036
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:56,650
But it turns out all you had to do was take a truck driving test and...

1037
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:59,219
and pour in cement.

1038
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,268
And then I thought about us.

1039
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:23,410
How maybe...

1040
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:33,554
Maybe you've got to go through
all the basd stuff first.

1041
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:37,758
You know, they--

1042
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:43,297
Hit a rock bottom.

1043
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:49,303
Hit this like low.

1044
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:55,709
Only it's not low,
it's like low low.

1045
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:08,355
Cause then maybe after that
all the good stuff happens.

1046
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:10,757
You know?

1047
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:15,429
'Cause like Nikola,
she's got a baby now.

1048
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:18,899
And she's with this great guy.

1049
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:21,235
I don't remember
his name, but...

1050
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:29,009
And she's got that nursing
assistents job, and...

1051
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:37,351
She hit bottom first.

1055
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,269
came by.

1056
01:27:57,873 --> 01:27:59,439
