01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:52,800
Is he a cretin?

1218
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,299
Come on, Elliott.

1219
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,443
Jack...

1220
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,981
you are so fucking neurotic.

1221
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,033
[ Panting ]

1222
01:13:32,674 --> 01:13:34,475
The hell with this madness.

1223
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,246
Just a golden wash of goodness

1224
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:41,282
has spread over all and
over all my body and mind.

1225
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:43,184
All the dark torture
is a memory.

1226
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:45,319
I know now I can
get out of there.

1227
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:46,521
We'll drive back to the city.

1228
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:47,522
I'll take Billie home.

1229
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:49,056
I'll say goodbye
to her properly.

1230
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:51,359
She won't commit no suicide
or do anything wrong.

1231
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:54,262
Billie will go on being golden
one way or the other.

1232
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,230
The little boy will grow up
and be a great man.

1233
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:58,065
Lenora's life will go on.
Old Lew will manage somehow.

1234
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:00,368
I'll forgive them
and explain everything.

1235
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,936
And Neal Cassady
and Albert Saijo

1236
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,304
and ravened Michael McClure

1237
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:04,939
and perfect,
starry Philip Whalen,

1238
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,808
they'll all pass through
one way or the other.

1239
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,876
I'll stay with Ferlinghetti
at his home a few days,

1240
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:11,512
and he'll smile and show me
how to be happy a while.

1241
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:13,080
We'll drink dry wine
instead of sweet

1242
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,049
and have quiet evenings
in his home.

1243
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:17,084
Ferlinghetti will say,
"That's all there is to it."

1244
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,286
"Take it easy.
Everything's okay."

1245
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,787
"Don't take things too serious."

1246
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,489
"It's bad enough as it is"

1247
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,925
without you going the deep end
over imaginary conceptions,

1248
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,460
"just like you
always said yourself."

1249
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:28,329
I'll get my ticket
and say goodbye on a flower day

1250
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:29,964
and leave
all San Francisco behind

1251
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,066
and go home
across autumn America,

1252
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,268
and it'll all be like
it was in the beginning,

1253
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,572
simple, golden eternity,
blessing all.

1254
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,574
Nothing ever happened,
not even this.

1255
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:41,075
There'll be farewells
and smiles.

1256
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,244
My mother will be
waiting for me glad.

1257
01:14:43,246 --> 01:14:45,146
The corner of the yard
where Tyke is buried

1258
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,681
will be a new
and fragrant shrine,

1259
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,382
making my home
more homelike somehow.

1260
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:51,252
Something good will come
out of all things yet,

1261
01:14:51,254 --> 01:14:54,155
and it will be golden
and eternal just like that.

1262
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,457
There's no need
to say another word.
