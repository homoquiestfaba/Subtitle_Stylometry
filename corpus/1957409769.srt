1
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:05,004
(intense music)

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,840
(thunder rumbles)

3
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,384
(wood creaking)

4
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,397
(thunder rumbles)

5
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,571
- Who's there?

6
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,576
(foot steps)

7
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:33,817
(intense music suddenly stops)

8
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:36,428
- I didn't realize anyone was
still left inside this house.

9
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,101
I'm here to film the storm.

10
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,937
It's getting pretty
bad out there again.

11
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,089
- Can you get me out of here?

12
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,168
- Well, most of the back
roads are completely flooded.

13
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:52,427
My vehicle can handle it,

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,947
So getting out of here
won't be a problem.

15
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,616
- Thank you.

16
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:58,842
Thank you.

17
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,619
I thought I was
gonna die down here.

18
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,605
- Wait, I know you.

19
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,790
You're on TV.

20
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,275
- Just occasionally.

21
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,127
- Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:09,035
You're on the think big channel.

23
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:11,130
Your Dr. Carl, the storm guy.

24
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,631
I love that show.

25
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,466
- Storm chaser.

26
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,210
- Right. Sorry.

27
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:19,863
I just, I can't believe
that I'm getting rescued

28
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,807
By Dr. Carl, the storm chaser.

29
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,629
- Is that what you
think is gonna happen?

30
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,057
(lightning cracks)

31
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,709
- Dr. Carl?

32
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:36,563
- You chose to ignore
all the warnings.

33
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:38,657
You chose to stay behind

34
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,219
Even after being
told to evacuate.

35
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:44,663
Now you just expect
to be rescued

36
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:48,000
Because you realize
you made a mistake.

37
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,335
How utterly arrogant of you?

38
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,337
- I mean I-

39
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:53,172
- What is your name?

40
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,507
- Anna.

41
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,343
- Right, Anna.

42
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:03,348
You will be a lesson to others

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,742
When they are forced to choose

44
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:08,520
Between their own
narcissistic pride

45
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,858
And the warnings
of mother nature.

46
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,030
After all, if that
window were to break

47
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,032
While you were
standing underneath it,

48
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:22,034
I mean, you could
be seriously injured

49
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:23,760
By heavy falling objects

50
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,371
Or lacerated by glass.

51
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,356
I mean, Anna, people,

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,936
They need to know how
dangerous these storms are.

53
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:34,271
And you,

54
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,791
You are gonna be another person

55
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:40,052
Who's gonna share
that with the masses.

56
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:42,221
Right?

57
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:45,057
- Yes.

58
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,391
Oh my goodness, yes.

59
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:49,228
I mean, I made a huge
mistake staying behind

60
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:53,715
But I'll never ever make
that mistake ever again.

61
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,566
- No.

62
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,235
You won't.

63
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,908
(intense music)

64
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,915
(water running)

65
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,816
- Hurricane season
in full swing.

66
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,909
And with Jonas currently
wreaking havoc,

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,503
Coastal residents
are living in fear

68
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:24,930
Wondering when the next big one

69
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:26,765
Will hit the Brody peninsula.

70
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:30,102
I'm here with local, Abby fields
to see how she's preparing.

71
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,831
Abby, how are you gearing up
for this hurricane season?

72
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,275
- Well, I'm good to go.

73
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:38,777
The usual extra supplies,
food, water, et cetera.

74
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,113
But I won't start worrying
until we hear otherwise.

75
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,598
- [reporter] what about
the mandatory evacuation?

76
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,449
Would you leave?

77
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:48,512
- Well, as a medical
professional,

78
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:50,622
My first priority
is to my patients.

79
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,106
So if I'm gonna keep them safe

80
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,941
And that means evacuating,

81
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,460
Then that's what we'll do.

82
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,307
- The bulk of the storm
is proceeding offshore.

83
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,217
A category 2 of monster storm

84
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,646
Is just waiting to move
in and level this town.

85
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:20,152
That lightning, it could
split a tree in two

86
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,804
Or turn a man to ash.

87
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,657
And over the course
of only a few minutes,

88
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,825
Literally hundreds-

89
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,237
- [voice on radio]
the hurricane friction

90
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,497
Has passed through the area

91
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,982
And the search for
survivors has began.

92
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,336
The death toll
crept up to 30 today

93
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:40,172
And authorities are
concerned it'll go higher.

94
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,507
- Oh, it'll go higher.

95
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,178
A lot higher.

96
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,198
(phone vibrating)

97
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:16,875
- Hey, hank.

98
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,268
- [hank] Carl, my man.

99
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,879
That storm footage
is just killer.

100
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,455
I love it.

101
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:24,031
- Yeah, I'm glad you like it.

102
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,533
But you know,

103
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,886
It's a storm that's really
doing the heavy lifting, hank.

104
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,389
- It's great.

105
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,965
This season is really shaping
up to be one of the best.

106
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:34,709
Now, get back here so I can
get my hands on that footage.

107
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,621
- Yeah, look, hank,
I'm tracking the storm

108
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:39,398
Off the Brody
peninsula right now.

109
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,732
- [hank] where's that?

110
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:41,733
Never heard of it.

111
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:44,236
Carl?

112
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:45,070
You there?

113
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:47,739
Carl?

114
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:51,985
- It's remarkable.

115
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,745
- [hank] remarkable?

116
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,414
What's remarkable?

117
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,250
- The storm cell is
remarkable, hank.

118
00:06:58,326 --> 00:07:00,752
It's velocity,
it's air pressure.

119
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,162
- [hank] yeah, yeah,
yeah, that sounds great.

120
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,755
Get down there, give me
more footage, you know-

121
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:04,923
- Okay, I'm on it.

122
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,602
The storm's coming
at (indistinct)

123
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,271
The storm is coming.

124
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,609
(intense music)

125
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:31,116
(intense music stops)

126
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,953
(gentle music)

127
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,701
(phone vibrating)

128
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,188
(sighs)

129
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,449
(inhales deeply)

130
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,043
- Hey tony, what's up?

131
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,714
No, the indomethacin is in
the cabinet next to her bed.

132
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,051
Yep.

133
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,224
And don't forget, it's
your turn to change report.

134
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:20,058
Uh-huh.

135
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,734
Uh-huh.

136
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:33,905
Yeah.

137
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,148
Oh, and remind me to
talk to the doctor

138
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,892
About glycerol levels
in coma patients.

139
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,244
Yeah, I've read an
article about it,

140
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,246
And I just want to
see what he thinks.

141
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:43,081
Yeah.

142
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:46,751
Wait, last thing, I swear.

143
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,311
Brush your hair.

144
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:50,255
My mom always said,
look good, feel good,

145
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,239
So, who knows?

146
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,593
Maybe Hannah will feel
so good, she'll wake up.

147
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,935
(soft music)

148
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:39,638
(sharp exhale)

149
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,369
- I specifically said that
if she were to be read to,

150
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:48,204
It should be
something stimulating.

151
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:50,206
We want her brain active.

152
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,983
We want her to wake up.

153
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:56,154
Were you aware of what tony
here was reading my sister?

154
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,067
Cut curbs and 50 other
ways to blast your abs.

155
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:03,736
- I just felt T. S.
Elliot wasn'T giving us

156
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,664
Enough workout tips.

157
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,407
- There are dozens
of studies that say,

158
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,168
If you read a coma patient
the wrong type of information,

159
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,170
It can do irreparable damage.

160
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,491
- This is a printout from
natural healing data work.

161
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,510
- From a doctor.

162
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,995
- Chiropractor.

163
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,589
- Ms. Banks, the passion you
have for Hannah is commendable.

164
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,350
Tony and I respect that.

165
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:28,169
But you can't just come in
here and yell at us like this.

166
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,187
- I'm not yelling.

167
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,859
I am simply airing
my grievances.

168
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,361
That's what I pay you for.

169
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,512
- That's what you
pay a therapist for.

170
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,773
- You pay us to take
good care of your sister,

171
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:41,774
Day in and day out,

172
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:43,201
And that's what we're doing.

173
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,371
- Fine.

174
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,449
But if you're going
to read to her,

175
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:54,045
Can you please make the
material a little more engaging?

176
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,622
I have a library
full of classics.

177
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:57,716
I think that's fair.

178
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,553
Since I have you both
here, I think now is a...

179
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,966
- Now as we just reported,

180
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,451
The national weather service

181
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,062
Has issued a warning
for all coastal counties

182
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:14,399
That hurricane Carey has
rapidly shifted course,

183
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:17,902
- And will make landfall
by 4:00 pm this evening.

184
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:21,147
All residents are
encouraged to find shelter,

185
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,723
And all peninsula residents

186
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:27,061
Are urged to evacuate to
the main land immediately.

187
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,823
- Hurricane Carey is
projected to be a category 3,

188
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:33,901
Causing massive
destruction with a 300.

189
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,829
(audio muted)

190
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:38,239
- Fantastic.

191
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,333
Exactly what we needed.

192
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:42,576
How do we handle
something like this?

193
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,820
- Okay, hang on.

194
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,246
Let me just, I'll
call the hospital,

195
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,432
I'll see if I can get
us an ambulance, okay?

196
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,773
- So, should I start
prepping Hannah for a move?

197
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:58,109
- And?

198
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:00,670
- It was busy.

199
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:01,946
Which means they're overwhelmed.

200
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:03,782
They have hundreds of
patients to evacuate.

201
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,451
We are low on the
list of priorities.

202
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,288
- So we have to
wait it out then.

203
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:12,365
- Miss banks-

204
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:13,941
- There is a generator out back,

205
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,294
This house was
built in the 1800s.

206
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,445
It's had much worse.

207
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,355
Come on.

208
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:20,632
You know that I am right.

209
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,634
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

210
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,638
Look, you're both welcome
to leave, that's fine.

211
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,882
But I'm staying with my sister.

212
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:30,809
- I can't let you do-

213
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:32,385
- You can't let me do what?

214
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,312
- I can't let you do that alone.

215
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,298
- Cool.

216
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,817
Let's make a night of it.

217
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,561
- Tony, if you hurry, you can
still get to the mainland.

218
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:42,879
- I don't have a car ab.

219
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,213
And plus I doubt I can
catch an uber right now.

220
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:45,898
Peninsula's evacuating.

221
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,659
And I think I'd be violating
my Hippocratic oath

222
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,493
If I left early.

223
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:52,572
- Okay. Well, if you're sure
that's what you want to do.

224
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:56,668
I guess it would be good
to have another nurse here.

225
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,169
- I guess.

226
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,672
(phone rings)

227
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,324
Are you gonna get that,

228
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,509
Or are we meant to delight
in its incessant ringing?

229
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,501
- Yeah, I should go
check the generator.

230
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,353
Yeah.

231
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:25,196
- Is this your
original crown molding?

232
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,041
- We need to refuel.

233
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:38,025
If the power goes-

234
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,544
- Well, why is this empty?

235
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:40,712
Why aren't you keeping
an eye on this?

236
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:43,548
- I'm not your
housekeeper miss banks.

237
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,550
You'll need to talk
to your other help.

238
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,036
- How long does Hannah's
equipment have on battery?

239
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,722
- 30 minutes.

240
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,057
- Well, then we need to
send someone to town.

241
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:54,726
Now.

242
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,563
(thunder rumbles)

243
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,900
- Do you want me to explode?

244
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,476
- Excuse me.

245
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:05,403
- You're asking the guy that
just got off a 14-hour shift,

246
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,406
Who hasn't slept in
probably 20 hours

247
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,799
To drive into town,

248
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,725
To pick up five gallons
of unleaded fuel

249
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,820
During the early stages
of a category 3 hurricane.

250
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:17,415
So I'm just gonna ask you again,

251
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:18,899
Do you want me to explode?

252
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,309
'cause I'm definitely gonna
crash one of your cars

253
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:23,254
And you know, explode.

254
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,426
- A simple, no,
would have sufficed.

255
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:29,594
- Okay. No.

256
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:31,429
- He's right.

257
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,489
I'll go.

258
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,099
- If he's too tired to drive,

259
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:38,102
He's too tired to
take care of Hannah.

260
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,939
- You can wake him up if
something major happens.

261
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:42,515
Tony, are you up for that?

262
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,258
- Of course.

263
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,777
- You should get some
more supplies too
if you're going out.

264
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,111
You know, snack up.

265
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:51,007
- Good idea.

266
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,283
Just nothing frivolous.

267
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,435
- Oh, s'mores.

268
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,286
- Got it.

269
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,790
- You can have carbs
during a hurricane.

270
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:05,463
(waves roaring)
(thunder rumbling)

271
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:15,974
- Please.

272
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,810
Please be leaving.

273
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,162
Let's hope you don't
make the same mistake.

274
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,511
- Well?

275
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:55,680
- Well.

276
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,017
- Well, we have
preparations to make.

277
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,093
- I just finished my shift,

278
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:02,336
So I was hoping I
can take a quick nap.

279
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,596
- I'm thinking you can
start with the batteries

280
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:05,189
For the lanterns
and the flashlight.

281
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,525
And then I'm going to text
Abby to see about shelf-

282
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:09,527
- Take it easy.

283
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:10,695
One thing at a time.

284
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,030
- One thing at a time?

285
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:13,422
There are a million things
that need to be done

286
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,091
Before this thing lands.

287
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,277
- Oh my god do
you need to relax.

288
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:19,445
Hey, you're not gonna
get anything done

289
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:20,872
If you have yourself
a heart attack.

290
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,191
- I don't think you are
grasping the severity of the-

291
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,043
- Oh, oh.

292
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,361
Deep breaths.

293
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,881
(deep inhale)

294
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:38,056
That was close. Look at me.

295
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:39,373
Don't get lost in there.

296
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,224
Deep breaths.

297
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,209
You can do it.

298
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,878
(deep inhale)

299
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,398
(slow exhale)

300
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,384
Yeah.

301
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,885
Isn't that nice?

302
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,906
See, now you're starting to
act a little less like a robot.

303
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,244
- You can start with
Hannah's medical inventory.

304
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,080
A log was off last week.

305
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:03,414
- Miss banks, I didn't mean-

306
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:04,749
- Just see to it.

307
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,420
(dramatic music)

308
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,315
(phone vibrating)

309
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:13,985
- This is Redford.

310
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,469
- Jack?

311
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,487
- Abby.

312
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:17,396
Hey.

313
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:18,805
- Did I catch you at a bad time?

314
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,657
Are you busy?

315
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:21,826
- A missing person case.

316
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,662
- Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

317
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:26,497
You're in the middle of
something way more important.

318
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:27,814
Just to call me
back when you're-

319
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,982
- Ab, it's fine.

320
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,002
I've got a second.

321
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:31,836
How are you?

322
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:37,008
I'm just returning your call.

323
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,845
- Right, of course.

324
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:43,739
That storm is coming.

325
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:44,849
It's gonna be a bad one

326
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,411
And we're evacuating everyone
we can off the coast.

327
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,021
I just wanna make
sure you're okay.

328
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:51,931
Are you off peninsula yet?

329
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:52,857
- I'm fine.

330
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:55,751
- That didn't
answer my question.

331
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,028
Tell me you're evacuating.

332
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:01,032
- Listen, I appreciate the
concern, jack, really, but I'm-

333
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:02,366
- So you're staying?

334
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:03,684
- How can I leave?

335
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,428
- You get in your car
and you drive to safety.

336
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,537
It's not rocket science.

337
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:09,707
- It's not that simple.

338
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:12,435
I'm sorry I can't just tell
you what you want to hear.

339
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:13,544
- I'm coming to you then.

340
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,379
- Absolutely not.

341
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,048
This is my job, jack.

342
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:19,050
It's what I signed up for.

343
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,867
- Why do you have to be so damn-

344
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,369
- Headstrong?

345
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,889
Yeah, I was about to say
the exact same thing to you.

346
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,299
I'll be fine.

347
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:29,060
I don't need a white knight.

348
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,895
- That's not what
I'm trying to do.

349
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:35,566
- Promise me you won't come.

350
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:36,959
- There you are.

351
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,143
- Huh?

352
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,570
- Sorry, I just solved
my missing person case.

353
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:40,404
I've got to run.

354
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,078
This the right one?

355
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,746
Fantastic.

356
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,581
Now, we had a deal.

357
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:51,974
I find your dyno,

358
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:53,993
And you joined your
parents in the bus.

359
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:55,086
You ready little lady?

360
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:58,089
Come on.

361
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,581
(gasps)

362
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,432
- Sorry.

363
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:10,434
Didn't mean to frighten you.

364
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,085
- Almost gave me a heart attack.

365
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,105
You can't just do
that to people.

366
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:15,498
- My apologies.

367
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,608
You look like someone I knew.

368
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:21,112
I wanted to help you
with your groceries.

369
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,446
- Well, I'm all done.

370
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:23,447
But thanks.

371
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,009
I know you.

372
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,120
You're that guy from
the think big channel.

373
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:31,938
- Yeah. Yeah.

374
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,607
Carl Highstrom.

375
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,793
- Well, if they're sending
Carl the storm chaser out,

376
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:37,870
This must be a pretty bad one.

377
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,130
- I've looked at the satellites

378
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:41,132
And they call this a
hundred year storm.

379
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,301
Well, that would be
under selling it.

380
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:47,880
You're not staying, right?

381
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,718
- Why does everybody seems so
concerned about that today?

382
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,979
I'll be fine, but thank you.

383
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,150
- You looked...

384
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:01,986
It's uncanny.

385
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:05,823
You look just like
someone I used to know.

386
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:06,657
She's gone.

387
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,828
She stayed behind in a
storm just like this.

388
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,498
You really should
leave the peninsula,

389
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,000
You know, set an sample.

390
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,395
- I appreciate the advice

391
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:23,174
But I've responsibilities,
storm or not.

392
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:26,344
- We all have responsibilities.

393
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:31,349
But please, do your very
best to not be here.

394
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,186
I'd hate for something
bad to happen to you.

395
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:47,531
- Of course, he
drives a creepy van.

396
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:51,944
- Hospitals all over the region

397
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:54,354
Are moving patients
by the hundreds

398
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:58,283
Off the peninsula before
Carey makes landfall.

399
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:00,769
Officials seem to be overwhelmed

400
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:03,029
At the sudden change of course.

401
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,050
And people are demanding
answers as to why the state

402
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:10,221
Was not better prepared for an
emergency of this magnitude.

403
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,055
- Need help?

404
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:12,539
- I'm good, tony.

405
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,725
Thanks for almost asking.

406
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,301
- S'mores?

407
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:18,896
- I got you chocolate, graham
crackers and marshmallows.

408
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:19,897
You can make your own.

409
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,732
- Oh, too much work.

410
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,240
- You good?

411
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:32,576
Ms. Banks.

412
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:35,913
- This was our parents' house.

413
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,644
I wanted to sell it, make
some money, reinvest.

414
00:23:41,662 --> 00:23:44,163
What was I gonna do
with all this space?

415
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:45,089
But Hannah,

416
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,593
She thought our families
could vacation here one day.

417
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,097
She was always so much
more optimistic than me.

418
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:55,599
- Is.

419
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:57,935
- Excuse me.

420
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:01,772
- She is more
optimistic than you.

421
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,608
She's not gone.

422
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,612
Plus her doctor said she's
likely to wake up anytime.

423
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,950
- You don't really
believe that, do you?

424
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:13,784
- You don't?

425
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,455
All of her doctors
seem really hopeful.

426
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,456
- Hopeful?

427
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,627
There's been no change.

428
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,633
She just feels further
away than ever.

429
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:33,804
- You want to hear
something silly?

430
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:40,126
Every morning before work,
I say a little prayer,

431
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,314
I'll walk in here and find
Hannah cooking breakfast.

432
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,879
- If my sister wakes up
an ab blaster over there

433
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,715
Lets her make her own breakfast,

434
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,658
You'll have a new coma patient.

435
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,994
(chuckles)

436
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,662
- Got it.

437
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,334
- So it begins.

438
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:09,840
(dramatic music)

439
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,190
(rain pounding)

440
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:31,529
- Dammit Abby.

441
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,203
- Bridge is shut down.

442
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,056
Oh, hey.

443
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,707
You're a little out of your
jurisdiction, aren't you man?

444
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,226
- Yeah, my...

445
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:04,119
An old friend of
mine is stuck there

446
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:05,137
Looking after her patient

447
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,379
And I don't want
her to be alone.

448
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,398
- I can't let you through.

449
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:08,899
Bridge is officially closed now.

450
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,216
Sorry man.

451
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,645
- Listen, I can really
use the favor here.

452
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,072
I'm worried about her.

453
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:19,743
- There's no other way
to get on the peninsula.

454
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,062
And don't even try to go
three miles in that direction

455
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:22,988
Down the road

456
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,415
And over the old
railroad bridge.

457
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:26,399
It's big enough for
a car to get over

458
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:27,492
And there's no cop
in front of it,

459
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:29,920
But it's illegal
and a little stupid.

460
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:30,754
Got it?

461
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:31,589
- Thanks man.

462
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,572
And one more thing.

463
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:33,740
- What?

464
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,167
- You got anyone still
on the peninsula?

465
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,594
Can you call it in.

466
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,262
Check on the banks' house
over on Vaughn street.

467
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:39,930
- I better be getting a
Christmas card for this,

468
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,414
This year.

469
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,100
- If you're ever in Hooperton,
look me up. I'll buy.

470
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,021
Dispatch?

471
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:59,617
Need a wellness check on
"banks", 109 Vaughn street.

472
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:03,528
(indistinct voice on the radio)

473
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:04,788
Hope she's worth it pal.

474
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,965
(waves roaring)

475
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:17,635
(wind blowing)

476
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:23,790
(thunder rumbling)

477
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,310
- Meanwhile on the
Brody peninsula,

478
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:30,463
Winds are beginning to
register at 100 miles per hour,

479
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:34,467
Threatening to cause
significant amounts of damage.

480
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,655
And while surfers in
the quince cove area-

481
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:39,657
- Looks like you
mastered the strength.

482
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:53,337
(gentle music)

483
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,523
Tony's asleep.

484
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,192
So I got an extra
s'more if you want it.

485
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,694
- Thanks.

486
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,029
You're getting a raise
for the Armageddon snacks.

487
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:23,108
- Well, technically
tony made this one, so-

488
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,702
- I take it back then.

489
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:26,036
- Oh, okay.

490
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:27,353
Well, I'll just go bury
this one in the backyard

491
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,373
And then make you a
fresh one then, okay?

492
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:32,876
Hey, there's a smile.

493
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:35,379
See, I told him you were human.

494
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,106
- I used to smile all the time.

495
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,383
I used to be fun.

496
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,553
Even more shocking, I
used to be laid back.

497
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:45,889
Kinda.

498
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:49,560
That was before everything.

499
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,895
- I'm sorry miss banks.

500
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,897
I didn't mean anything by it.

501
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:54,732
- It's fine.

502
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,402
You know I'm not
normally someone

503
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,978
Who second guesses herself,

504
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,407
But I'm starting to wonder if
we should have tried harder

505
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:04,241
To leave.

506
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:06,076
- It's okay.

507
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,913
We're gonna be okay.

508
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,916
(lightning cracks)

509
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,259
- This is where the storm
will begin it's rampage.

510
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,095
This is where the storm
will begin its rampage.

511
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:26,263
Two, one.

512
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,841
This is where the storm
will begin its rampage,

513
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:31,493
Off the Brody peninsula.

514
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:33,937
It will ravage
everything in it's wake.

515
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:37,090
Monuments, places of
worship, people's homes.

516
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,003
This atmospheric phenomenon
does not discriminate.

517
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:43,763
It will breach their
homes like an angry god.

518
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,115
An angry god.

519
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:48,619
Like an angry god,
searching for sacrifices.

520
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:50,120
The ultimate question then.

521
00:29:50,197 --> 00:29:52,347
The ultimate
question then being.

522
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:54,458
The ultimate
question then being,

523
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:57,628
Will they know the storm is
upon them before it's too late?

524
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,524
Unfortunately, many of
these older coastal towns

525
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,284
Tend to be in the
same power grid.

526
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,787
So if the storm chooses
to knock out one,

527
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,807
Well, there goes
the neighborhood.

528
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,979
When will they learn?

529
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,150
- Why are we doing
this in the basement

530
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,986
Surrounded by all the
Halloween decorations?

531
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:24,988
And by lantern?

532
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,639
The power is still on.

533
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,661
- Because candlelight in
the storm is romantic.

534
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,663
- Honey, that's not a candle.

535
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,906
Also won't be romantic
if the roof rips off.

536
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,166
- The roof isn't going anywhere.

537
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:37,893
The house is more than fine.

538
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:40,003
They used to really
know how to make them.

539
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,730
- You know there's a puddle
in the middle of the room,

540
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:42,506
Right?

541
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,417
- You want me to turn
on the sump pump?

542
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:46,902
- That wire looks super sketchy.

543
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:48,494
I'd rather not die
by electrocution.

544
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,681
- It's for the generator
if the power goes out.

545
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,683
Totally safe.

546
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,834
- I can't believe you
talked me into staying.

547
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,336
I must be crazy.

548
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,763
- Crazy enough to
have said, I do.

549
00:30:58,916 --> 00:30:59,857
You're a Barrett now.

550
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:02,693
- I still feel
weird to hear that.

551
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:04,269
- My family has been
on this peninsula,

552
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,179
Rain or shine for 120 years.

553
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,681
I'm not about to mess
with perfection now.

554
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,702
- Oh, is that what it's
called? Perfection.

555
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,705
- Well, let me make
it better for you.

556
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,544
(squeaking sound)

557
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:22,362
- Did you hear that?

558
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,122
- Yeah, it was probably
just a squirrel or something

559
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:25,215
Trying to stay dry.

560
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,126
(loud bang)

561
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:29,720
- That's a pretty big squirrel.

562
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:32,890
- Maybe some muskrat.

563
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:35,893
I'll go check it out.

564
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:44,568
(wind howling)

565
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:48,238
Just in case he's
a mean muskrat.

566
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:56,747
Hello?

567
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:15,432
Anyone there?

568
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,272
Not that you would answer.

569
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,620
(thunder rumbles)

570
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:48,298
(foot steps)

571
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:16,660
(lightning cracks)

572
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,171
(screaming)

573
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:32,843
(Carl shushes Helen)

574
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:36,680
- I don't like there to be
screaming until the end.

575
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,685
Is this your boyfriend?

576
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:46,672
Husband. Yeah.

577
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,524
I see.

578
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:51,010
I had a wife once.

579
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,029
She's gone now.

580
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:55,699
Stupid people.

581
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,535
You think this is fun?

582
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,039
Staying behind in a storm.

583
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,948
It's what? Romantic?

584
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,691
- Sir, please don't do this.

585
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:06,543
Please.

586
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:08,545
- It's already done.

587
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:11,214
I didn't do anything.

588
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,960
The winds, the
rain, they did it.

589
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:21,224
You stayed behind and
nature took its course.

590
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:24,561
Don't you see?

591
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:27,064
I'm nature.

592
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,292
I'm the storm.

593
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,069
- Please. Please. Please.

594
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,573
- I'll give you this though.

595
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:42,913
You cried a lot less
than your husband did.

596
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:48,919
(bat thumping)

597
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:58,077
- So many machines
working to keep her alive.

598
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,429
- Doing a great job of it.

599
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:06,269
Remember walking around, making
breakfast anytime, right?

600
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:13,759
(Ella gasps)

601
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,779
It's okay. She
won't feel anything.

602
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,006
(Ella gasps)

603
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,282
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

604
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,527
- You're afraid of needles.

605
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,012
- No, I'm not afraid.

606
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,122
I just don't like them.

607
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,124
Get on with it.

608
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,958
- Okay.

609
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:36,133
- See, perfectly fine.

610
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:41,212
- The eye of the storm hasn't
even come to shore yet,

611
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:43,548
And already the winds
are strong enough

612
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,311
To rain down shards of broken
trees like ancient spears.

613
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,889
But this isn't some Greek
soldier throwing a lance,

614
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,650
No, it's mother nature herself.

615
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:54,818
And her strength is such

616
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,047
That she can shatter your ribs

617
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:02,050
Or pierce right
through your torso

618
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:03,994
In a matter of seconds.

619
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,833
(rain pounding)

620
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:20,343
- You'll probably
yell at me anyways.

621
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:34,858
- You okay?

622
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,772
- I was doing so much
better with them.

623
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:44,367
And now here I am hiding in
my room, shaking like a leaf.

624
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,945
- Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

625
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:49,522
I used to date a
cop twice your size.

626
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,209
Every time he'd give blood,
he'd go out like a light.

627
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,546
- Sounds like he should've
stopped giving blood then.

628
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:57,881
- I said the same thing.

629
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,050
He said he would.

630
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:05,055
He said he would when
people stopped needing it.

631
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,391
- You should've seen me

632
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:09,726
When Hannah was still
in the hospital.

633
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,712
Nurse would come
in with a syringe,

634
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,065
And I'd wake up on the
floor looking up at her.

635
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,642
- Probably you
should've have just left

636
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:19,069
When you heard them come in.

637
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,145
- I couldn't leave.

638
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:22,739
Not then, not in the beginning.

639
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:24,741
I just kept thinking,

640
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:30,080
Any minute now
she's gonna wake up.

641
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,583
And I had to be
there when she did.

642
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:36,753
- You're a good sister.

643
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:39,923
- Doesn't always feel that way.

644
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:46,263
I know I'm not the easiest
person to get along with.

645
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:48,265
- No, you're-

646
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,268
- You don't need to be polite.

647
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,271
Let's just say, difficult.

648
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:56,439
- In a good way.

649
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,276
- That's sweet.

650
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:06,449
It's just, this
house and Hannah,

651
00:38:10,013 --> 00:38:11,788
There all that I have.

652
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:16,684
After the accident,
my boyfriend left.

653
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,110
And our parents are gone,

654
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,465
So I've just been here
alone, waiting for a miracle.

655
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,787
So if it seems like I
don't appreciate you.

656
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,638
I do.

657
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:31,975
I'm really glad
you're Hannah's nurse.

658
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:36,813
I might fire tony
next week though.

659
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:39,649
(both chuckle)

660
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:40,483
- There it is.

661
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:47,231
(door bell rings)

662
00:38:47,384 --> 00:38:49,326
- Can we help you, officer?

663
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:52,403
- I guess you folks didn't
hear about the evacuation.

664
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:54,331
- No we heard, but-

665
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:56,074
- My sister is in a coma

666
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:57,575
And can't be moved
with anything less

667
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:59,561
Than a full medivac by air.

668
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:00,895
If you're offering one,

669
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:02,839
We'll be more than
happy to take it.

670
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,584
Until that time, I urge
that you watch your tone.

671
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:09,253
- Well, someone asked me to
come here and check on you.

672
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:10,663
And now that I have,

673
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,683
And I see that you are
just super pleasant,

674
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,668
I guess I'll be on my way.

675
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,502
- Great.

676
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,354
Goodbye.

677
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:21,858
- Officer, just
out of curiosity,

678
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:23,526
Who asked you to check in on us?

679
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,363
- Some cop from the mainland.

680
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:29,366
I don't know his name, but
when I find out who it was,

681
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:32,093
I'll be sure to let them
know just how happy I was

682
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:33,203
To drive all this way.

683
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:36,039
- Sorry.

684
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:37,707
Thanks for coming, officer.

685
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:56,893
- Greek soldier
throwing a lancet.

686
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:00,230
It's mother nature herself.

687
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,900
Or should it be itself?

688
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,903
No. Herself. Yeah.

689
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,740
Oh gosh.

690
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:11,908
Oh, I don't know.

691
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:14,969
I'm feeling like maybe I should
shoot that last commentary

692
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:15,745
Again.

693
00:40:17,157 --> 00:40:17,914
What do you think?

694
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:19,824
What?

695
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:21,084
No opinion?

696
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:24,646
It's a pity.

697
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:29,592
- Hello?

698
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,597
Hello?

699
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,793
Dispatch, I'm gonna
need you to send...

700
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:06,629
(thunder cracks)

701
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:22,145
This is the police.

702
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,148
If you're down
there, say something.

703
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:43,983
Drop what you're holding,
hands on your head.

704
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,335
- There's a window, right?

705
00:41:46,396 --> 00:41:48,171
Hadn't broken the window yet.

706
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,507
And that's how you knew
that something was wrong.

707
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:52,342
It's clever.

708
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:54,919
You would have gone far.

709
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,013
- Stay where you are.

710
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,516
- Look, I have to say,

711
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:02,018
I really do respect
first responders, I do.

712
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,855
Yet, I'm surprised
that you took a risk

713
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,099
Of coming out here in this storm

714
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:10,084
Without rubber sole shoes on.

715
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:12,920
I mean that's very dangerous.

716
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:14,513
You should have known better.

717
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,533
I mean, sure, it's gonna
be an odd looking scene,

718
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,442
But I'm sure they'll
piece it together.

719
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:19,869
- This is your last chance.

720
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:22,205
Drop it.

721
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,873
- Okay, officer.

722
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,209
If you say so.

723
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:30,547
(electric shock)

724
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:38,946
- It's okay.

725
00:42:38,948 --> 00:42:41,115
That's what the generator's for.

726
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:42,559
Just give it a second.

727
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:46,563
Three, two, one.

728
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,733
(generator roars)

729
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:51,734
It worked.

730
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:53,236
I'll have to refill it soon.

731
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:55,238
Which means going
back out in the storm.

732
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:58,741
- Sounds like a job for
tony when he gets up.

733
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,746
(dial tone)

734
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,253
(phone vibrating)

735
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:27,770
- Hey.

736
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:29,772
- I believe you sent
someone to check up on us.

737
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,441
I told you I had it covered.

738
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:33,276
You really didn't
need to do that.

739
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:37,096
- Doing well. Thanks for asking.

740
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,781
My knee is acting up a
bit and mild swelling,

741
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,007
But otherwise-

742
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:41,784
- This isn't a
time to joke, jack.

743
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,457
Listen, I appreciate
the concern,

744
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:50,460
But I need to know that you
are not coming out here.

745
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:51,869
- What are you so mad about?

746
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:53,296
Of course I'm concerned.

747
00:43:53,373 --> 00:43:54,279
I'm a cop.

748
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,706
I did what I do.

749
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:57,282
- I can't help but feel
like you're using the storm

750
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,968
As an excuse.

751
00:43:59,045 --> 00:44:00,803
I thought we both agreed
that it would be better

752
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:03,047
If it was a clean break.

753
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,808
- One, you said that, not me.

754
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,460
And two, just because you
care more about your job

755
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,646
Than you do me,

756
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:10,980
Doesn't mean I stopped
caring about you.

757
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:13,875
- Don't act all
sanctimonious with me, okay.

758
00:44:13,877 --> 00:44:15,485
That's a two way street.

759
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:18,154
You can't have two people
more dedicated to their jobs

760
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:18,988
Than each other.

761
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,473
- Okay.

762
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,826
Well, maybe you're wrong
what I care about most, ab.

763
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:26,829
- Tell me, where
are you right now?

764
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:30,166
- Emotionally, pretty lost.

765
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:32,743
- Physically.

766
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:33,670
- Oh, that.

767
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:36,839
Pretty lost.

768
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,840
- You're impossible.

769
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:42,069
You better not be
coming out here, okay?

770
00:44:42,071 --> 00:44:44,572
It's not worth putting
yourself in danger.

771
00:44:44,574 --> 00:44:46,182
- I think I'm the one
who gets to decide that.

772
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:49,168
- Not everyone needs
to be saved, jack.

773
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,687
- Yeah?

774
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:53,672
Tell that to everyone
you and I have saved.

775
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:58,528
(lightning cracks)
(phone beeping)

776
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:01,030
Well, that went great.

777
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:05,927
(car ignition goes silent)

778
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:06,703
Come on.

779
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,500
- Abby?

780
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:18,789
- Sorry about that.

781
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:21,384
- Was that the blood donor?

782
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:23,553
- Yeah.

783
00:45:25,298 --> 00:45:26,055
- Come on.

784
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,560
(car ignition rattling)

785
00:45:33,122 --> 00:45:35,047
- He sent the cop
to check in on us,

786
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,399
And he won't tell
me where he is.

787
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,068
So part of me is worried
he's coming out here too.

788
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:41,571
- Sounds monstrous.

789
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:42,905
All that caring.

790
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:46,576
- Yeah, he's a pretty great guy.

791
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:48,745
- And the problem is?

792
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,436
My ex said the thing that drew
him to me was my ambition.

793
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:16,773
And then when that drive got
transferred over to Hannah,

794
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,442
He lost interest.

795
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:22,612
You and her can be a
pretty nasty thing, huh?

796
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,447
- Yeah.

797
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:27,784
I just wish mine would stop
crawling onto my sleeve.

798
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:31,287
- Life is too short.

799
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,018
I don't care about the fights
we had over this stupid house

800
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:40,855
Or that she got mad I drank
out of the milk carton.

801
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:45,802
I know for a fact I'll
regret every moment

802
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:50,881
I didn't spend with her,

803
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:53,034
Every time I put work first,

804
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:53,810
Every...

805
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,317
Do you know why I hired you?

806
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,320
- My skills with the needle?

807
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:12,328
- You're the only person who
asked what Hannah's name was.

808
00:47:13,723 --> 00:47:16,666
It showed that you
cared, just immediately.

809
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:21,078
So maybe there's something

810
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,505
To that heart being
on your sleeve.

811
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:27,677
I wish I could show it more.

812
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:31,848
Most people assume
that I'm cold.

813
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:35,184
I'm not.

814
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:37,836
I just have trouble-

815
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:39,188
- Showing it?

816
00:47:39,265 --> 00:47:40,022
- Yeah.

817
00:47:42,935 --> 00:47:44,343
Yeah.

818
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,529
I wish I would have shown
it a bit more today.

819
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,368
You are the most capable
nurse I've ever met.

820
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:57,707
It's incredible watching
you care for Hannah.

821
00:47:59,952 --> 00:48:02,194
And you never once
threw an iv bag at me,

822
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,714
Even though I am sure
you have wanted to.

823
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:07,216
If you can show that to me,

824
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:11,554
Then I don't see why
you can't with...

825
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:12,388
- Jack.

826
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:18,227
- Listen, I am gonna
try and get some rest.

827
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:23,232
You have some time, right?

828
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:24,808
Before I hand this next shot?

829
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:26,569
- Yeah, until nine.

830
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,905
- Okay.

831
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:31,132
Then I don't think it'd be
a total dereliction of duty

832
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,816
To have a little drink.

833
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,804
I'm pretty sure there's an
absolutely no drinking section

834
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:39,415
On like page seven
of my contract.

835
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:42,326
- And I'm pretty sure staying
overnight during a hurricane

836
00:48:42,478 --> 00:48:44,086
Is not mentioned once.

837
00:48:44,163 --> 00:48:46,255
(Abby chuckles)

838
00:48:46,332 --> 00:48:48,424
- Perhaps I'll rewrite
that thing in the morning.

839
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:54,672
- Thank you for the talk and-

840
00:48:54,824 --> 00:48:56,933
- Just don't wake the boss up.

841
00:48:57,009 --> 00:48:58,267
She can be kind of cranky.

842
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,949
(sighs)

843
00:49:13,025 --> 00:49:16,768
- I'll save you for later.

844
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:19,271
(lightning cracks)

845
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,958
(sharp exhale)

846
00:50:22,762 --> 00:50:24,687
- If you woke up
right now, Hannah,

847
00:50:26,098 --> 00:50:28,524
Would you think we're all
nuts for staying behind?

848
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:40,369
I'll be right back.

849
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,564
(rain pounding)

850
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:21,577
- (indistinct)

851
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,422
- Is this why you
stayed stayed behind?

852
00:51:45,845 --> 00:51:47,436
That's very touching.

853
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:58,948
(lightning cracks)

854
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,951
- Come on ab, keep it together.

855
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,788
- They should have had a
plan to get you out of here.

856
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:10,459
How very irresponsible of them.

857
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:19,135
But you will be the easiest one.

858
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:26,809
The kind of people who
wouldn't find a way

859
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,977
To get you out of here

860
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:32,314
Are the same kind,
sloppy people,

861
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,985
Who don't do the little things.

862
00:52:38,564 --> 00:52:39,488
Aren't they?

863
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,523
(lightning cracks)

864
00:53:19,438 --> 00:53:22,364
(thunder rumbling)

865
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,872
(lightning cracks)

866
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,577
She'll have to wait.

867
00:54:11,323 --> 00:54:12,414
You'll do for now.

868
00:54:33,512 --> 00:54:36,438
(thunder rumbling)

869
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,119
- There a leak?

870
00:54:58,612 --> 00:54:59,628
- [tony] Abby?

871
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:12,883
- Evening sunshine.

872
00:55:13,035 --> 00:55:14,384
- We didn't die.

873
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:16,645
So, I'll get a cup of coffee
and then start my shift.

874
00:55:16,797 --> 00:55:17,962
- It's okay.

875
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,206
I'm good to stay on a
little while longer.

876
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:20,316
- Okay.

877
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,042
Anything I can do
in the meantime?

878
00:55:22,044 --> 00:55:23,210
- Yes, actually.

879
00:55:23,212 --> 00:55:24,711
Can you refill the generator?

880
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,304
It got low. I got more gas,

881
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:28,306
But the can is
still in the garage.

882
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:30,784
- No time like the
present, I guess.

883
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:32,661
- Thanks tony.

884
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:33,954
- Yep.
- Appreciate it.

885
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:41,912
Did you go outside already?

886
00:55:42,064 --> 00:55:42,796
- Huh?

887
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:44,748
I don't know.

888
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,008
Maybe it's a leak or something.

889
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:49,511
Ab, it's a crazy
big storm, okay?

890
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:50,512
Maybe it's the wind.

891
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:53,349
- Did you hear that?

892
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:55,476
- What?

893
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:59,079
- Just go fill the generator
and come right back, okay?

894
00:55:59,098 --> 00:56:00,414
- Yeah.

895
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:03,433
Hey, hey, you okay?

896
00:56:03,586 --> 00:56:05,419
- Yeah, I'm fine, I
just, I don't know.

897
00:56:05,437 --> 00:56:06,528
Something feels off.

898
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:08,422
Maybe the storm's
just getting to me.

899
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,180
- Yeah.

900
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,440
- Just be quick.

901
00:56:10,593 --> 00:56:11,200
You don't get to be
struck by lightning

902
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:12,183
Or drowned in a puddle.

903
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:13,260
- Okay, I'll do my best, okay?

904
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:14,036
- Okay.

905
00:56:14,947 --> 00:56:15,871
Go. Hurry.

906
00:56:51,817 --> 00:56:52,724
- Too close.

907
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,301
There's too many of them.

908
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,987
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

909
00:56:57,139 --> 00:56:57,746
Why?

910
00:56:57,898 --> 00:56:59,039
Why did you stay behind?

911
00:56:59,992 --> 00:57:01,542
God, you're smarter than this.

912
00:57:02,995 --> 00:57:07,923
How could you do this to me?

913
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:08,882
How?

914
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:15,722
Help.

915
00:57:19,495 --> 00:57:20,227
The eye.

916
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:28,444
- Can I help you?

917
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,449
Wait, I know you, don't I?

918
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,196
(machine beeping)

919
00:57:39,348 --> 00:57:40,080
- Hannah.

920
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:42,607
- Tv or something.

921
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,793
You're like a preacher or an
infomercial guy or something?

922
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,129
- Storm chaser.

923
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,422
- All right, awesome.

924
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:50,857
Fernando, right?

925
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:52,042
- Carl.

926
00:57:52,194 --> 00:57:54,928
(machine beeping)

927
00:58:00,052 --> 00:58:01,143
- What's going on?

928
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,886
- I don't know.
She's just crashing.

929
00:58:03,038 --> 00:58:05,314
- Are you here for
the storm, Carl?

930
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:10,635
- Actually, I want
someone to help me film.

931
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,469
- What do you mean, why?

932
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:12,637
- I don't know.

933
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,214
- What do you mean
you don't know?

934
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:15,974
- Miss banks, I'm gonna
need you to help or get out.

935
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:16,992
Do you understand me?

936
00:58:18,737 --> 00:58:19,553
- Yes.

937
00:58:19,555 --> 00:58:20,829
- Good. Do you know CPR?

938
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:23,890
- I really gotta get inside.

939
00:58:23,892 --> 00:58:25,075
- No, no, no, come on.

940
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:27,169
It's just gonna take
a moment of your time.

941
00:58:27,246 --> 00:58:28,837
And then you can
tell your friends

942
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:30,339
That you are a storm survivor

943
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,341
With Carl Highstrom.

944
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:38,238
- Tony, he's just-

945
00:58:38,257 --> 00:58:40,832
- No time. Do you know CPR?

946
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,742
- Yes.

947
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:42,684
- Good. Start.

948
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,191
(intense dramatic music)

949
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:59,493
- One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

950
00:59:04,116 --> 00:59:05,374
- I've never used
a camera like this.

951
00:59:05,525 --> 00:59:07,042
- No, no, no, it's simple.

952
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,603
Look, just point at me and hit
that little red button, okay?

953
00:59:09,605 --> 00:59:12,105
That's it. Easy peasy.

954
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,290
- I don't know about this, man.

955
00:59:13,442 --> 00:59:14,274
I really got to get inside.

956
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:15,551
- It's just gonna take a minute.

957
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:17,035
Maybe two.

958
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,202
Come on.

959
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,446
We'll go out,
we'll shoot a take.

960
00:59:19,448 --> 00:59:20,889
Yeah? What do you say?

961
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:23,617
- All right.

962
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:24,685
- Awesome. All right.

963
00:59:25,954 --> 00:59:29,189
- On the count of
one, two, three.

964
00:59:36,315 --> 00:59:37,239
Right there.

965
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:41,743
- What the...

966
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:47,749
- It's the eye.

967
00:59:49,494 --> 00:59:51,920
It's gonna give us a couple
of moments of silence,

968
00:59:52,072 --> 00:59:53,905
Which is what we wanted.

969
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,716
Okay, let's do
this. Camera on me.

970
00:59:57,502 --> 00:59:59,077
Red button.

971
00:59:59,096 --> 00:59:59,928
Okay.

972
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:01,597
And, action.

973
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,601
- Oh god.

974
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:07,494
- What? What is it?

975
01:00:07,512 --> 01:00:09,162
- Her iv has been detached.

976
01:00:09,181 --> 01:00:10,272
- What?

977
01:00:10,423 --> 01:00:11,773
- It's fine. We'll
worry about that later.

978
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:13,775
I'm gonna need you
to take this needle.

979
01:00:13,927 --> 01:00:15,669
- No, I can't do that.

980
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:16,612
- You can do this.

981
01:00:16,688 --> 01:00:17,779
- No, Abby.

982
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,114
- For your sister.

983
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:20,449
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

984
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:23,601
- Just tell me
what I need to do.

985
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,029
- When I say,
exactly when I say,

986
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:27,456
I'm gonna need
you to inject her.

987
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:28,457
- Do I need to hit a vein?

988
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:29,850
- You can.

989
01:00:29,868 --> 01:00:30,626
But I'm not asking
for miracles here.

990
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:32,628
Just get it in her.

991
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:35,464
- I stand here in
a moment of calm

992
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:38,759
In an otherwise
devastating storm.

993
01:00:40,212 --> 01:00:44,122
Which is a metaphor of
what I have gone through

994
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,098
In my own life.

995
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:49,293
Moments of pause in between

996
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,203
- Now

997
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:51,438
- Raging storms.

998
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:57,653
Earlier this evening, I too
paused just like the storm.

999
01:00:59,214 --> 01:01:01,990
Unsure of whether I should
continue with my mission.

1000
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:02,883
- It's not working.

1001
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:04,067
- It'll work.

1002
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:09,122
- Or float off the night
like a wayward cloud.

1003
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,003
- Are you okay?

1004
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,171
Carl? Dude?

1005
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:18,131
Are you okay?

1006
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:20,400
- Yeah. Yeah.

1007
01:01:20,402 --> 01:01:21,301
Keep on, please.

1008
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,140
Some storms dissipate
into the air.

1009
01:01:28,427 --> 01:01:32,837
And then there's others
that rage uncontrollably

1010
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,981
Until all of their
energy is spent.

1011
01:01:36,009 --> 01:01:38,860
Tonight is one of those storms.

1012
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:42,531
Cut. Yeah.

1013
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:46,927
- That was intense.

1014
01:01:46,945 --> 01:01:48,111
- Yeah?

1015
01:01:48,263 --> 01:01:49,612
Too much?

1016
01:01:49,765 --> 01:01:50,780
- Yeah.

1017
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:52,098
This isn't Shakespeare,
it's a storm.

1018
01:01:52,117 --> 01:01:53,542
You gonna creep people out.

1019
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:56,619
All right, I'm
gonna head inside.

1020
01:01:56,772 --> 01:01:58,046
Killer death storm and all.

1021
01:01:58,198 --> 01:01:59,881
- I don't think you're gonna
have to worry about that.

1022
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:01,532
- Really? Is it over?

1023
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,777
- Well here, let me show you.

1024
01:02:03,795 --> 01:02:05,220
Take a look at the
scene on the camera.

1025
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:06,179
- All right.

1026
01:02:11,954 --> 01:02:13,395
(Carl tsking)

1027
01:02:13,472 --> 01:02:16,565
- You know it actually happens
more often than you think.

1028
01:02:16,716 --> 01:02:18,233
Someone was out in the storm.

1029
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:22,028
They slip, they fall,
get knocked unconscious

1030
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:26,700
And end end up
drowning in a pond.

1031
01:02:28,303 --> 01:02:29,244
It is a pitiful way to die

1032
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,079
But it's believable.

1033
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:42,924
Right on time.

1034
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:52,768
- Come on.

1035
01:02:54,087 --> 01:02:56,271
(Ella sobs)

1036
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:01,735
- I think we're in the clear.

1037
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:07,282
Are you okay?

1038
01:03:11,271 --> 01:03:15,031
- Why was the iv detached, Abby?

1039
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:16,291
- Miss banks.

1040
01:03:16,368 --> 01:03:18,776
- You were the last
person in this room.

1041
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:20,353
- Miss banks.

1042
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:23,206
- You made a mistake that
could have killed my sister.

1043
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:24,090
- Ella!

1044
01:03:26,695 --> 01:03:29,212
I think there's someone
else in the house with us.

1045
01:03:29,364 --> 01:03:30,380
- What?

1046
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:31,364
Tony is-

1047
01:03:31,383 --> 01:03:33,975
- No, I mean someone else.

1048
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,978
The backdoor looked like
it had been broken into,

1049
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,648
And there are wet footprints
all over the house.

1050
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,817
The rug next to your
bed was soaking wet.

1051
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,654
I make mistakes,
I'm not perfect,

1052
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,615
But I am positive that iv
was secure when we left.

1053
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,384
We are not alone.

1054
01:03:51,403 --> 01:03:54,571
(lightning cracks)

1055
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:55,789
- Why did the power go?

1056
01:03:57,576 --> 01:03:59,459
- Tony, I sent him to refuel.

1057
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:07,008
We've 30 minutes to get the
generator back up and running.

1058
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,570
Otherwise Hannah's equipment
will stop and she will die.

1059
01:04:10,589 --> 01:04:12,013
- Okay.

1060
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,407
Okay, what do I do?

1061
01:04:14,426 --> 01:04:15,758
- I need you to stay here,

1062
01:04:15,911 --> 01:04:16,643
Lock the door

1063
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,079
I'm gonna go outside,

1064
01:04:19,097 --> 01:04:21,147
Find tony and get the
generator back up and running.

1065
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,861
Once that's done, I'll
come back to help you.

1066
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,607
29 minutes.

1067
01:04:30,759 --> 01:04:31,491
- Go.

1068
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:35,704
(upbeat music)

1069
01:04:55,951 --> 01:05:00,729
During the bowl of a dull,
dark and (indistinct) day

1070
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,231
In the autumn of that year,

1071
01:05:03,383 --> 01:05:06,526
When the clouds hung
oppressively low in the heavens.

1072
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,388
- Tony?

1073
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,241
(thunder rumbles)

1074
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:28,423
Tony?

1075
01:06:25,131 --> 01:06:27,131
Here we go.

1076
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,986
(rain drops pounding heavily)

1077
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:10,150
Tony!

1078
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:17,157
(melancholic music)

1079
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:07,749
(wood crackles)

1080
01:08:10,478 --> 01:08:11,211
- Abby?

1081
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:17,425
(door knob clanking)

1082
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,684
Whoever you are,
get out of my house.

1083
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:25,952
- Hey, ab.

1084
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,238
Are you okay?

1085
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:30,556
- Jack?

1086
01:09:30,558 --> 01:09:32,000
- There's a body
on the front lawn.

1087
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:34,410
- Thank god you (screams).

1088
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:36,579
- Why did you stay?

1089
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:37,463
Why?

1090
01:10:00,438 --> 01:10:04,949
We should probably talk
this out, you and me.

1091
01:10:07,595 --> 01:10:08,953
I'm not the villain here, ab.

1092
01:10:10,949 --> 01:10:13,124
That is what he
calls you, right?

1093
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,335
Ab?

1094
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:18,046
That's cute.

1095
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,173
That's cute.

1096
01:10:23,278 --> 01:10:28,139
I used to call my wife, beaches.

1097
01:10:29,951 --> 01:10:30,850
Her name's Sandra.

1098
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,896
Sandy, sandy beaches.

1099
01:10:38,142 --> 01:10:38,858
Beaches.

1100
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:44,572
It was cute.

1101
01:10:48,136 --> 01:10:48,910
Just like you two.

1102
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:55,833
She died, you know, in a storm,

1103
01:10:57,161 --> 01:10:58,253
Just like this one.

1104
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,929
You want to know what happened?

1105
01:11:13,177 --> 01:11:15,561
I was working out of town,

1106
01:11:17,256 --> 01:11:18,940
I got a call from
a friend of mine,

1107
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:22,193
Works for the weather service.

1108
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:29,433
And he said, beaches,
Sandra, who's home alone,

1109
01:11:30,194 --> 01:11:31,035
She's gonna get hit by a storm.

1110
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:33,913
A big one.

1111
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,459
Worse than this one even.

1112
01:11:38,536 --> 01:11:40,853
Oh, I was worried, of
course, and I called her,

1113
01:11:40,872 --> 01:11:45,049
And I said, "honey, you
gotta get out of there."

1114
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:47,927
She told me she would,

1115
01:11:53,384 --> 01:11:54,767
So I was relieved.

1116
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:00,148
And the next day
in the afternoon

1117
01:12:00,299 --> 01:12:02,400
When I was at the airport
waiting to go home,

1118
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,278
I get the call.

1119
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:12,160
She died.

1120
01:12:17,225 --> 01:12:19,584
She stayed and she died.

1121
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:29,010
She was with a neighbor.

1122
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,514
Do you understand me, ab?

1123
01:12:36,077 --> 01:12:39,604
She was with a neighbor,

1124
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:41,981
A man,

1125
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:47,987
In my house,

1126
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,157
In my bed.

1127
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:55,995
In my bed.

1128
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:06,381
She stayed because she
wanted to be with him.

1129
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:13,779
But I realized, after
every one of these storms,

1130
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:15,056
These disasters,

1131
01:13:16,451 --> 01:13:18,810
There's always a tragic story

1132
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:22,688
About the people
who stayed behind,

1133
01:13:26,294 --> 01:13:27,402
Even for good reasons.

1134
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:32,740
And there's the others,
you know, like my wife,

1135
01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:35,910
Who wants to think that
it's okay to stay behind.

1136
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:39,229
They're not gonna die.

1137
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,082
That they're stronger
than the storm.

1138
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,923
Nobody ever questions
the blunt force trauma,

1139
01:13:52,503 --> 01:13:53,261
The suffocation,

1140
01:13:56,658 --> 01:13:57,598
The electrocution.

1141
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,827
No, they just attribute
it to the storm.

1142
01:14:01,846 --> 01:14:02,728
Never to me.

1143
01:14:04,165 --> 01:14:06,015
Do you know what I think, ab?

1144
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:11,070
I think that everybody
deep down subconsciously,

1145
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,522
They agree with me, yeah.

1146
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:16,284
'cause nobody
investigates too hard, no.

1147
01:14:16,435 --> 01:14:18,286
Because they know,

1148
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:23,199
They know that people who
stay behind deserve to die.

1149
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:28,963
They know that the
storm has to kill them.

1150
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:33,951
You understand, ab?

1151
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,378
The storm has to kill.

1152
01:14:36,531 --> 01:14:37,263
Oh!

1153
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:51,068
(upbeat music)

1154
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,751
(generator roars)

1155
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:17,086
- Yes.

1156
01:15:17,238 --> 01:15:19,238
(watch beeping)

1157
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,497
Oh, god.

1158
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:23,242
Please be okay, please be okay.

1159
01:15:23,244 --> 01:15:24,018
Oh, god.

1160
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:29,982
- Now who's the white knight?

1161
01:15:31,419 --> 01:15:33,010
- Okay, come on.

1162
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,420
(jack groans in pain)

1163
01:15:34,422 --> 01:15:35,321
- Sorry.

1164
01:15:36,607 --> 01:15:38,274
Could have been here sooner

1165
01:15:38,426 --> 01:15:39,283
But my car flooded.

1166
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:42,870
- Never been happier to see you.

1167
01:15:42,947 --> 01:15:44,764
Does your radio still work?

1168
01:15:44,782 --> 01:15:45,689
- No idea.

1169
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,523
(jack groans)

1170
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:47,792
- Okay, come on.

1171
01:16:01,132 --> 01:16:03,282
- What is going on?

1172
01:16:03,284 --> 01:16:04,617
Oh, he hit me.

1173
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:05,709
- I need your hand.

1174
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,854
(jack groans in pain)

1175
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,818
- Listen, I just
wanted to say...

1176
01:16:17,556 --> 01:16:18,322
- No!

1177
01:16:27,642 --> 01:16:30,993
(Carl groaning)

1178
01:16:31,145 --> 01:16:33,087
(upbeat intense music)

1179
01:16:33,164 --> 01:16:33,921
- Stop!

1180
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:37,550
Don't you move.

1181
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:41,721
- How are you gonna
make this look natural?

1182
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,057
Or are you gonna blame
this on the storm?

1183
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,894
Bullets don't fly
through hurricanes, Carl.

1184
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:52,898
I thought about that.

1185
01:16:54,185 --> 01:16:55,425
How's this?

1186
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,945
The bullheaded cop ex,

1187
01:16:58,097 --> 01:17:02,842
He can't handle the pain
of the woman that he loves

1188
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,360
Not being with him.

1189
01:17:04,512 --> 01:17:09,290
So, in a jealous rage, he
drives to where she works

1190
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,962
And he murders her young lover
and everyone in the house

1191
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:17,298
Before committing suicide.

1192
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,635
Of course the people in
the house, they fight back,

1193
01:17:20,711 --> 01:17:22,970
But he overcomes them all.

1194
01:17:23,047 --> 01:17:24,380
(sarcastic laugh)

1195
01:17:24,532 --> 01:17:25,264
Yeah?

1196
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:27,808
- Only one problem.

1197
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,127
- What's that?

1198
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,480
- I called the police
five minutes ago, Carl.

1199
01:17:35,559 --> 01:17:38,110
(Carl screams)

1200
01:17:39,897 --> 01:17:44,825
- I said, get out of my house!

1201
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:55,836
You okay?

1202
01:17:55,988 --> 01:17:57,413
- Tony's dead.

1203
01:17:57,565 --> 01:17:58,255
- What?

1204
01:18:00,251 --> 01:18:02,826
- [Carl] you're
not safe in there.

1205
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,679
- He's not gonna stop.

1206
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,523
Police will be here
any minute, just leave!

1207
01:18:18,252 --> 01:18:20,102
(Carl laughs hysterically)

1208
01:18:20,254 --> 01:18:24,106
- You think yelling at
the storm scares it?

1209
01:18:24,258 --> 01:18:24,990
Do you?

1210
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,994
You can't stop the
wrath of nature.

1211
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:36,669
- This is it.

1212
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:49,390
- Is he walking away?

1213
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,061
- Hannah.

1214
01:18:56,715 --> 01:18:57,857
No, Ella, wait!

1215
01:19:03,464 --> 01:19:06,148
- We've done this dance
before, you and I.

1216
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,826
This time I'll be sure
to squeeze up tighter.

1217
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:10,703
Stop!

1218
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:18,043
I squeeze, and I will separate
the skull from the vertebrae.

1219
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:19,420
- What do you want?

1220
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,591
- Want?

1221
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:24,675
What do I want?

1222
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:27,094
I don't want anything.

1223
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,913
It's the storm.

1224
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,599
The storm wants you dead.

1225
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:35,561
- Is this is what your
wife would have wanted?

1226
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:37,921
- What're you doing?

1227
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,939
Don't you talk about my wife.

1228
01:19:39,016 --> 01:19:39,774
Don't do talk about my wife!

1229
01:19:40,835 --> 01:19:41,567
Don't!

1230
01:19:43,671 --> 01:19:45,279
- Doing this won't
bring her back.

1231
01:19:47,191 --> 01:19:48,908
- You don't think
that I know that?

1232
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:53,270
Huh?

1233
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,938
That's not the point.

1234
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,583
The point is to set an example.

1235
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,753
To show people,

1236
01:20:02,206 --> 01:20:04,924
So that this never
ever happens again.

1237
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:11,138
You see, I'm the good guy here.

1238
01:20:14,293 --> 01:20:15,434
- Carl! Carl!

1239
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:18,312
- You look so much like her.

1240
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:24,777
I hoped you were
smarter than her though.

1241
01:20:26,047 --> 01:20:27,822
But you weren't.

1242
01:20:27,898 --> 01:20:30,115
And you had to stay behind.

1243
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:34,161
- For her.

1244
01:20:35,389 --> 01:20:36,622
We stayed for her.

1245
01:20:39,076 --> 01:20:41,410
I know I should have left,

1246
01:20:41,562 --> 01:20:44,338
But then I'd be the coward that
left everyone in harms way.

1247
01:20:46,233 --> 01:20:49,009
I knew dangers, but
I did it anyway.

1248
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,515
I'm the good guy, Carl.

1249
01:20:54,592 --> 01:20:55,349
- No! No!

1250
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:56,183
I...

1251
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,185
I...

1252
01:20:58,262 --> 01:20:59,019
No!

1253
01:20:59,096 --> 01:20:59,812
No!

1254
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:09,113
No!

1255
01:21:10,682 --> 01:21:12,199
No!

1256
01:21:12,276 --> 01:21:13,868
You should have had a plan.

1257
01:21:14,019 --> 01:21:16,186
Everything that's
happened is your fault.

1258
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,205
Now you all have to die.

1259
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,218
- The storm is over.

1260
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:43,898
- I was driving home

1261
01:21:43,974 --> 01:21:48,551
And then I was having
the most awful nightmare.

1262
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,221
There was a man whose...

1263
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,965
He was talking to me.

1264
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:55,058
I could hear him talking to me.

1265
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,819
And then I woke up and he
was trying to hurt you,

1266
01:21:57,972 --> 01:22:00,080
So I had to save you.

1267
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:03,233
What's going on?

1268
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,644
- We have a lot to talk about.

1269
01:22:05,646 --> 01:22:06,420
- No!

1270
01:22:07,481 --> 01:22:08,172
- Freeze!

1271
01:22:13,821 --> 01:22:14,553
- Jack.

1272
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:18,098
- Ab, cuff this son of a bitch.

1273
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,608
(chuckles)

1274
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:34,782
(gentle music)

1275
01:22:36,177 --> 01:22:38,702
- [paramedic] got two over here.

1276
01:22:41,682 --> 01:22:44,700
- Hey, what else do
you want on these?

1277
01:22:44,852 --> 01:22:45,867
Whipped cream, syrup, butter?

1278
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,869
- How about all of it.

1279
01:22:48,022 --> 01:22:49,964
Here, let me help you.

1280
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,947
- No, no, no, no.

1281
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:51,966
You stay put.

1282
01:22:57,698 --> 01:22:59,214
- This looks so good.

1283
01:22:59,366 --> 01:23:00,307
- Thank you.

1284
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:03,143
Great. Okay.

1285
01:23:04,888 --> 01:23:09,708
Go.

1286
01:23:09,727 --> 01:23:10,818
- Ella, thank you,

1287
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,822
But I think I can do it.

1288
01:23:20,312 --> 01:23:20,995
- What else do you want?

1289
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:22,479
How about a muffin?

1290
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:25,332
- How about you relax,

1291
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:28,252
And just enjoy this
breakfast with me.

1292
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:34,508
- These look pretty good.

1293
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:36,826
You did a good job.
- You did a great job.

1294
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:38,070
- I'm not really much of a cook.

1295
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:38,920
- I know.

1296
01:23:39,073 --> 01:23:41,181
(both laugh)

1297
01:23:51,435 --> 01:23:53,085
- I'm sorry, jack.

1298
01:23:53,103 --> 01:23:54,361
I'm sorry for everything.

1299
01:23:55,606 --> 01:23:57,606
I don't wanna be away
from you anymore.

1300
01:23:59,017 --> 01:24:01,702
There is room in my life for
all of the things I love.

1301
01:24:03,947 --> 01:24:05,597
- I'm sorry too.

1302
01:24:05,616 --> 01:24:07,041
I love you, Abby.

1303
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,710
- I love you too.

1304
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,549
- Oh!
- Oops!

1305
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,292
Sorry, did I hurt you?

1306
01:24:17,444 --> 01:24:18,218
- Worth it.

1307
01:24:20,281 --> 01:24:21,797
Where do you think you're going?

1308
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:23,390
- With you. I'm going with you.

1309
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,468
- We both know where
you need to be.

1310
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,728
- But I can-

1311
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:29,137
- Ab, we'll have plenty
of time together later

1312
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,806
At the hospital.

1313
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,232
- Go see your patients.

1314
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,568
Bring me some burgers
when you come visit me.

1315
01:24:36,388 --> 01:24:37,813
- Okay.

1316
01:24:37,965 --> 01:24:40,324
(jack groans)

1317
01:24:50,327 --> 01:24:53,003
- Hi, do you want
some breakfast?

1318
01:24:54,906 --> 01:24:55,756
- Told you.

1319
01:24:59,987 --> 01:25:02,429
(police siren)

1320
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,771
- I know you.

1321
01:25:13,016 --> 01:25:14,441
- I'm sure you do.

1322
01:25:15,686 --> 01:25:18,112
- You're on that think
big channel, right?

1323
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:20,689
- Yep.

1324
01:25:20,841 --> 01:25:22,282
Storm chaser.

1325
01:25:22,434 --> 01:25:24,526
- Man, I watch you all the time.

1326
01:25:24,678 --> 01:25:26,286
That's crazy.

1327
01:25:26,438 --> 01:25:30,290
Hey, Nic, you know that dork
on the think big channel.

1328
01:25:30,442 --> 01:25:32,626
He's handcuffed back here.

1329
01:25:32,777 --> 01:25:33,535
- Who?

1330
01:25:33,687 --> 01:25:34,795
- This storm chaser guy.

1331
01:25:34,946 --> 01:25:37,548
He's always running
into 'em like a moron.

1332
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:40,134
- That's cool.

1333
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:42,302
- Crazy.

1334
01:25:43,547 --> 01:25:44,304
- [voice on radio]
you've been listening

1335
01:25:44,456 --> 01:25:46,365
To the KJWS with Jeff Jaime.

1336
01:25:46,383 --> 01:25:49,217
Now let's go to (indistinct)
for our weather update.

1337
01:25:50,795 --> 01:25:52,146
- [woman voice on
radio] residents will
only have mere weeks

1338
01:25:52,297 --> 01:25:55,374
To assess the damage done by
hurricane Carey before another-

1339
01:25:55,392 --> 01:25:57,317
- Hey, could you turn
that up a little?

1340
01:26:00,564 --> 01:26:02,138
- [woman voice on radio]
chance of severe thunderstorms

1341
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:05,217
Tonight with the
possibility of tornadoes.

1342
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:08,720
Citizens are asked to
take shelter to avoid-

1343
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:09,997
- That's it, sir.

1344
01:26:11,074 --> 01:26:13,167
I just needed the weather.

1345
01:26:15,078 --> 01:26:17,588
(upbeat music)

1346
01:28:06,006 --> 01:28:08,448
(gentle music)
