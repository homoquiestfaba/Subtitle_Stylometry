00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,906
I'll just-- I just live here.

189
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,775
[laughing]

190
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,677
She's a fool.

191
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:33,381
Sandy, your mother loves
you no matter what, OK?

192
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,384
I raised her and I know that you
guys are more similar than you

193
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,219
really know.

194
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,787
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

195
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,490
You was a rebel child
according to mama.

196
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,992
You was running around, doing
whatever the hell you want to.

197
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,328
Go to parties out
late, what not.

198
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:50,531
And you wonder why
I'm just like you.

199
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,933
It's cool.

200
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,902
[bag crinkling]

201
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,075
[? itsy ?] [? mo-mo? ?]

202
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:01,942
I'm sorry, baby.

203
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,444
I'm all over the place today.

204
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,278
I apologize.

205
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,679
Got my mind on a lot.

206
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,381
I told you, she
smoking that shit.

207
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,520
Mind your damn business.

208
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,486
OK?

209
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,255
I'm a prestigious manager now.

210
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,057
Everybody know your
ass the pothead.

211
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,825
That's how I know the signs.

212
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,895
Signs that exist
in your head, OK?

213
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,763
Anyway, Sandy, you
and your mother

214
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:23,964
are more alike than you know.

215
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,466
She loves you, OK?

216
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,670
Y'all both open minded, just
free hearted, spirited people.

217
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,474
And the worst she could
do is curse your ass out.

218
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,075
I mean--

219
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:34,909
You're right.

220
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,211
It wouldn't be the first time.

221
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,045
It wouldn't.

222
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,013
All right.

223
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,214
[fork ding]

224
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,416
This was good, love.

225
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:46,987
But I gotta get
ready to work, y'all.

226
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,390
Have fun with the Wicked
Witch of the basement.

227
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,358
[footsteps]

228
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,462
[music playing]

229
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:08,776
Yo, that shit banging, boy.

230
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:09,743
Appreciate it, bro.

231
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:11,245
We could have
finished it last night

232
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,314
if you ain't kick a nigga out.

233
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:15,216
Bro, you know how Tracy be, bro.

234
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,984
She don't be minding

00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,385
we got clients and shit.

236
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,354
When we just sitting

237
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,323

go to sleep, cuz.

238
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,657
Bro, I feel you.

239
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,860
But how I she expect this to
get anywhere with this shit

240
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,263
if we can't even be here
during prime creativity hours?

241
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,999
Man, kick that nigga Paul
out and let your boy move in.

242
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,200
No, facts.

243
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,070
Paul ass won't be doing
shit no way, you feel me?

244
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,038
That's my nigga, though, bro.

245
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,773
Hey, speaking of
kicking niggas out,

246
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:43,077
whatever happened

247
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:44,579
Fuck Josh, bro.

248
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,313
Damn, what I miss?

249
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,682
Nigga was trying to fight me
on some tough guy shit, bro.

250
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,184
Like, long story, bro.

251
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,452
Well shit, I got a time.

252
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:52,253
We ain't got no clients, man.

253
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:53,588
What the fuck happened?

254
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,823
Well look, apparently he ain't
like the way I came at him

255
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,858
and, like, the whole
time bro ain't paid rent

256
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,127
in like three months, like,
this shit ain't cheap, bro.

257
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,898
Like, I'm already on the verge
of losing all this shit, bro.

258
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:04,865
Damn.

259
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,268
So where y'all
scrap at, down here?

260
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,470
No.

261
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,038
In the kitchen.

262
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,674
Nigga, I would have took a
frying pan and mopped his head.

263
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,342
[laughing]

264
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,512
Hell no.

265
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,847
But dog, bro, like, you really
fixing to lose this spot.

266
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,182
Like, on some g-shit.

00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:22,917
Like, you really
fixing to lose it.

268
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,118
Yeah, man.

269
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,787
Lo said I got two weeks
to come up with the bread.

270
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,223
Damn, how much you owe him?

271
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,157
About 10 bands.

272
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,093
[coughing]

273
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,130
Yeah.

274
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,132
Shit.

275
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,335
Bro, you ain't paid
your rent in six months?

276
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,437
Bro, with what, bro?

277
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:45,674
Like, bro, my birthday
was in February.

278
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:48,008
You know what I'm saying,
like, I had the PPP shit here.

279
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,376
You know what I'm
saying, I broke

280
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,045
my man's off about eight bands.

281
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,548
And then Tracy wanted
to take her ass to DC

282
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,116
on some splurge shit
dinners, going out.

283
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,486
Bro, I'm still trying to
recoup from all that, bro.

284
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,488
Look, look, look,
fuck, all right, look.

285
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,291
We're going to get
the bread up, bro.

286
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,429
I can call cut, shit we can
go slide on some niggas.

287
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,730
Hell no, bro.

288
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,166
You know I'm trying to make
this music shit work, bro.

289
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,568
[exhale]

290
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:16,337
Yeah, well-- that
music shit ain't

291
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,073
fixing to give us 10
bands in two weeks, nigga.

292
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,140
Yeah, you right, bro.

293
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,775
I just--

294
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,278
Oh, all right, all right, boom.

295
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,914
It's this fight
coming up and it's

296
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,651
hella niggas that be with
that sports band shit, bro.

297
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,985
Like, I know a nigger, bro.

298
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,386
Like, that nigga never lose.

299
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:32,920
Right.

300
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,288
Yeah, word.

301
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,789
Like, I know that sports band
shit hitting right now too,

302
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:36,290
like--

303
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,991
Hell yeah.

304
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:37,825
That got to be the move.

305
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,093
Bro, that's definitely a move.

306
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:41,228
Like, if me, you and
[? cutty ?] could, like, just

307
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,997
put together five bands each.

308
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:43,864
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

309
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:44,932
Forgive me.

310
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,300
That's like 15, we
won't need that much.

311
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,036
But we could just put five racks
up between all three of us,

312
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,206
right, then put it
down on this fight.

313
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,675
You know what I'm
saying, I think--

314
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,577
you know what I'm saying, that
could be a good move for us

315
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:56,511
to save the house.

316
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:57,311
For sure, bro.

317
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:58,879
I mean, it sound good, bro.

318
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,814
But you know I got to
run it past Tracy, bro.

319
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,316
So like, you know
what I'm saying.

320
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,785
In the meantime, bro, let's
get back to cooking bro.

321
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,154
I'm going to holler at
the old lady later, bro.

322
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,989
I'll let you know how
everything shake out.

323
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,324
All right, all right, all right.

324
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,192
Yeah, for sure.

325
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,262
[music playing]

326
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,529
Oh, what's up, Mo?

327

[tv chatter]

328
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,299
Hey, y'all.

329
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,934
You can't speak?

330
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,436
[laughing]

331
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:00,941
I already spoke to the owner
of the house, freeloader.

332
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,543
Bitch.

333
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,315
Oh!

334
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,318
Girl, you scared
the shit out of me.

335
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,187
Auntie, we got to talk.

336
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:13,887
What's up, baby?

337
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,824
I seen you called me.

338
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:19,460
I talked to Tasha last night
and I think mama might know.

339
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,295
No.

340
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:21,895
What?

341
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,869
Shit, how?

342
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,304
I went out to the
club last night

343
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,206
and we was in our
home-girl section,

344
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,808
so I made out with
this girl that I've

345
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,810
seeing for a couple of weeks.

346
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,312
OK, Sandy, what does my sister
have to do with any of this?

347
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:43,150
Auntie, somebody showed mama
my friend's Instagram story.

348
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,185
Oh.

349
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,822
Baby, I'm so sorry.

350
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,290
She says she still want to want
to see me for Thanksgiving.

351
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,626
I can't deal with that, man.

352
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:52,993
You know how my mama is.

353
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,629
I don't want to deal
with her attitude.

354
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,831
You know how the time Uncle
Trip brought a man over

355
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,898
for Thanksgiving?

356
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,234
I got to get this
money together, fast.

357
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,137
This poor girl don't stand
a chance with my sister.

358
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,238
Auntie Mona?

359
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,173
I just got to find a
window later on tonight.

360
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,341
Auntie Mona?

361
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,711
Oh, baby.

362
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:10,512
I'm so sorry--

363
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:11,713
You just ignoring me?

364
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,080
Uh, uh, Sandy.

365
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,048
Now you not the only one going
through shit in this house.

366
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,519
Yeah, but you the only one I
can talk to you about my shit.

367
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,319
I thought you'd be
understanding of that.

368
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,588
You're just like everybody else.

369
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:21,989
OK.

370
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,092
Now what you're not fixing to do
is belittle me in my own space.

371
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,828
That I'm not going to have.

372
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,396
And one more thing,
I've defended you

373
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,566
for years when it came
to and your mother.

374
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,767
For years.

375
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,803
And one more thing, Sandy--

376
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:35,436
What?

377
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:37,104
She already knew.

378
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,207
[music playing]

379
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,543
Excuse me?

380
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:42,943
Yeah.

381
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,580
You remember that little friend
that you had when you were 12?

382
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,750
The one you was always with,
lollygagging with all the time?

383
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,950
Well, yeah.

384
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,019
One day the little girl
spent the night over.

385
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,353
Your mother seen y'all kiss.

386
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,025
You lying.

387
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,727
[sigh]

388
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,864
Sandy, why would I have to
lie about anything like that?

389
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,532
Explain to me that.

390
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:05,999
Yeah, she saw y'all.

391
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:06,768
OK?

392
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:07,669
Was she mad?

393
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:08,736
Of course.

394
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,305
But she never said
nothing to your father.

395
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:15,209
And she definitely caught
me that same night, though.

396
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,978
I don't-- I don't believe this.

397
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,449
I mean, look, Sandy.

398
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,520
Look, that's your mother.

399
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,522
After all these years,
you know, she kind of

400
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,591
thought it was a phase
that you was going through.

401
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:32,594
But you know, she could tell.

402
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:35,195
No, I can't believe that y'all
wouldn't tell me something like

403
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,396
that.

404
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,131
That could have completely
changed my relationship

405
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,099
with my mother.

406
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,802
Why would you
deprive me of that?

407
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:43,538
You were just thinking
about not going.

408
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,540
Keyword was thinking, Auntie.

409
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,340
You know what?

410
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,407
I don't got time for this.

411
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,510
I'm out of here.

412
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,878
Oh, yeah?

413
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:51,111
Where you going, Einstein?

414
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,212
Since you know it all.

415
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,915
I'm fixing to go live my life.

416
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,917
Something you would know
about if you weren't so

417
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,988
stuck up in your crackhead
bitch of an ex-boyfriend.

418
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,188
[door slam]

419
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,661
[music playing]

420
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,496
(SINGING) Daddy left the day I--

421
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,904
Who is it?

422
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:16,938
Chef Ramsay.

423
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,141
Go away, Tracy.

424
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,978
I'm not in the mood.

425
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,647
(SINGING) Fuck everything--

426
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,949
Well I'm coming in anyway.

427
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,751
Bitch, did you not hear me?

428
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,352
Look, I just came
in for two reasons.

429
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,155
One, to tell you that I'm
ordering pizza from the place

430
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,089
by the mall.

431
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,727
You know they got
to a vegan menu.

432
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:43,798
And I know how you was feeling.

433
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,668
What's wrong?

434
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:47,902
Girl, I'm feeling fucked up.

435
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,572
What happened?

436
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,707
Um.

437
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:56,744
First of all, don't get
too damn comfortable.

438
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,846
Girl, what's wrong with you?

439
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:02,215
I know your nosy ass heard
me and Sandy argument.

440
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,819
And she just
stormed out of here.

441
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,854
Just got up, left.

442
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,756
I don't even know if
she's going to be back.

443
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:11,091
But do you care?

444
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:11,993
Of course I care.

445
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,761
It's my damn niece.

446
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:17,397
But I'm 32 Trace.

447
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,668
Obviously, I'm not
having no kids right now.

448
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:24,404
That's my baby, like, Sandy
is the closest thing I ever

449
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,239
have to a daughter.

450
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,912
I don't want to lose her
or that relationship.

451
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:34,048
I feel you because
my sister and I had

452
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,516
the same type of relationship.

453
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:39,687
And the best way to
handle something like this

454
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,889
is just to take it head
on because if I was you,

455
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,859
I would not wait a couple
of hours before I reach out.

456
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,927
That's just my advice.

457
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,934
Yeah, that don't sound too bad.

458
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:54,468
Who would have
thought your ass would

459
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,737
be giving some good advice?

460
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:58,238
And who would have known
that your room is not

461
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,641
as messy as you.

462
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,141
Oh.

463
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,510
Bitch, fuck you.

[laughing]

465
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,415
I got so much shit on my mind.

466
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:12,020
It's just, like, when
I first came here,

467
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,788
I was in a fucked up place.

468
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,958
Like, I ain't have no job.

469
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:18,826
Me and my nigga
had just broke up.

470
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:21,562
Toxic as fuck.

471
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:23,163
Sandy was begging
to live with me,

472
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,533
but I couldn't have her
around all that shit.

473
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:28,201
That nigga just did
too fucking much.

474
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,805
I feel you.

475
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:34,742
But it's crazy because it's
like, I was feeling good, like,

476
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,309
when I moved here.

477
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,211
I got me a little job.

478
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,581
Moved my way up.

479
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,917
I got way more money.

480
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:47,922
It's like, that shit just
still can't take me away

481
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:48,790
from my problems.

482
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,693
Like, it doesn't
change anything.

483
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:54,862
I just really feel like I'm
just deeper than when I first

484
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:55,495
came here.

485
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:59,199
It's just, fuck.

486
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,135
I think we all feel
that way in some point.

487
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,303
Where you five steps
forward, then getting

488
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,339

conspiracy theorist now?

And no, I'm just

491
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,414

492
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,654
Well, news flash, home girl.

493
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:24,692
That rainbow you looking
for it's long fucking gone.

494
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,130
You know what, Mona.

495
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,938
Sometimes the rainbow is
right above you and maybe

496
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,439
that's why you never saw it.

497
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,909
(SINGING) Change my mind.

498
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,979

ball on third down?

You got it, bro.

C'mon, racist bullshit.

Get him out of here, bro.

00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:35,963

Yeah, exactly.

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,210
Now help me count
this shit, babe.

541
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,476

You know what, babe.

549
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:39,026
I forgot how damn smart you was.

550
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,965
That's why you're going
to marry me, right?

551

I just saw you.

558
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,546
How you find all this?

559
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:00,047
OK, look, I found
her this morning.

560
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,682
I just had to make sure
the coast was clear

561
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,017
and I just didn't want
that bitch to see me

562
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:03,851

563
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:05,119

00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:17,164
Babe, what is you talk--

Now, hold on, baby.

00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:22,637
Slow down, slow down.

Oh, look at you.

708
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,475
From the looks of things,
I'm assuming it was good.

709
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:43,010
Woke up in that bed.

710
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,844
It was good enough.

711
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,979
[laughing]

712
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,782
Not no thrill.

I'm fixing to hit the mall.

714
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,720
Grab some food.

Take this hoodie back.

719
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:01,929
What's wrong with the hoodie?

720
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,263
It looks pretty fine to me.

721
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,198
I know it ain't that--

722
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,899
$700 hoodie?

723
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:06,867
Yeah.

724
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:07,868
It's that deep.

I know.

729
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,441
But you're trying
to roll though?

730
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:16,110
[sigh]

731
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,144
Nah.

732
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:18,879
I'm going to wait on
Sandy to get back.

733
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:22,116
She can't stay mad
and gone forever.

734
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,351
I'm fixing to grab me a
drink before I dip though.

735
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,356
OK.

736
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,992
You know, I didn't
want to say nothing,

737
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,428
but I heard what happened
with you and Sandy last night.

738
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,236
It's fine.

739
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,606
She'll be all right.

740
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:48,610
I guess I just wanted to see
her to see if she accepts

741
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,978
my apology, if she all right.

742
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,781
Yeah, she good.

743
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:55,583
Don't even stress about it.

744
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:56,584
I guess you're right.

745
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,388
I don't hear no commotion.

746
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:02,990
When Josh gonna see you dead.

747
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,858
[laughing]

748
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,560
Yeah, you're funny.

749
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,861
I don't know.

750
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,998
I seen him earlier when I
pulled up not too long ago.

751
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,868
Did they say where
they was going?

752
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,336
I mean, I ain't ask him.

753
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:18,071
I just assumed they'd
be back later on.

754
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:25,647
They didn't say when
they was coming back?

755
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:30,317
I mean, he said he was
going to brunch, shopping.

756
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:34,154
Knowing Tracy, probably both.

757
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:36,023
Wow.

758
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:39,126
Brunch and shopping.

759
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:41,395
Little suspicious
about all this shit.

760
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,964
You good, Mona?

761
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,065
Yeah, I'm good.

762
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,835
I'm just thinking about
Sandy, that's all.

763
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,736
And that fucking money.

764
00:32:48,837 --> 00:32:53,307
Sandy just young,
hell, give her time.

765
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:54,676
She needs time anyway.

766
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,377
You know, give her a
chance to think about it.

767
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:05,486
I'll be back later, maybe.

768
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:08,021
[laughing]

769
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,734
[music playing]

770
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:25,507
(SINGING) That's supply.

771
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,745
Birds of the same feather
going to fly together.

772
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:33,146
She flyer than the rest,
then she think I'ma let her.

773
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:36,718
We ain't needing [inaudible].

774
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:39,787
m
gonna call that bitch myself.

775
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:40,822
[scream]

776
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:41,990
Who the hell are you
and what the fuck

777
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,892
are you doing in my house?

778
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:46,026
It's not important.

779
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:49,531
What is important is I
have a very serious problem

780
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:51,064
and I need some help.

781
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:52,199
Can you help me?

782
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,033
Help?

783
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,235
Nigga, I'm about to call 911.

784
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:58,506
Bitch, sit your dumb ass down.

785
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:01,275
You got five minutes to tell
me where the fuck my money at.

786
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,209
(SINGING) Yeah.

787
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,545
I let my driver
hit the blunt, now

788
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:04,679
I know I'm fixing to be late.

789
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,113
Niggas saying they
dripping, boy--

790
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,415
Listen, ain't even
no need to tie me up.

791
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:10,919
I don't even know
what's going on.

792
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,054
Now, that's not the point.

793
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:17,424
Point is, I need you tell
me where my $50,000 is.

794
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,027
If you was in my
shoes and trying

795
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:22,129
to find out about that much
money, you'd tied me up too.

796
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:25,232
Otherwise, I'm running away
and ain't telling you shit.

797
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:26,366
OK, genius.

798
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:29,369
If I would have ran, you
could have just shot me.

799
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,305
You got a death
wish, or something?

800
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,775
Besides, I need you alive.

801
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,543
Killing you wouldn't
do me any good.

802
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,645
So get comfortable cause
I ain't going nowhere

803
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:38,846
without that bag, bitch.

804
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:40,147
(SINGING) Grab some more dirt.

805
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:42,215
I cut off because
shorty was playing.

806
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:44,184
Now she claiming that
her feelings are hurt.

807
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:48,823
But that ain't the
way we do business.

808
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,992
She only with me for
really the moment.

809
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,694
I got no--

810
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,762
[inaudible]

811
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:00,735
What the hell y'all got
going on up in here?

812
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:01,536
Mhm.

813
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:02,737
Come on.

814
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:05,305
Come on.

815
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,440
Come on.

816
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,643
I can't stand your
motherfucking ass, bitch.

817
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:09,844
You always getting us into--

818
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:10,545
Shut the fuck up.

819
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,846
You shut the fuck--

820
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:15,215
Bro, what the fuck is
taking this girl so long?

821
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,451
Bro, I swear to her
to be in and out.

822
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:22,189
Women, bro.

823
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,026
Just see what's going on.

824
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,095
(SINGING) That ain't
love, what you call it?

825
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,563
[door shut]

826
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,868
You shut the fuck up.

827
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,903
Somebody know what I'm looking
for and I don't like how

828
00:35:36,004 --> 00:35:37,505
y'all stalling me right now.

829
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:38,606
Stalling?

830
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,273
Ain't nobody stalling you.

831
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,275
I came here to get
something and leave.

832
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:46,213
If anybody knows something,
it's that bitch there.

833
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,850
Bitch, you know damn well
you the grimiest motherfucker

834
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,250
in this house.

835
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,352
Somebody better start talking,
or y'all hoes about to be laid

836
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:54,088
on the floor.

837
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:56,456
This lying ass hoe.

838
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,291
And you really going
to sit up here and lie,

839
00:35:58,392 --> 00:35:59,459
like you didn't have it.

840
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,395
Bro, what the fuck
going on in here?

841
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,031
I'm going to tell
you like I told them.

842
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:06,000
I came for my bread and I
ain't leaving till I get it.

843
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,135
What money, nigga?

844
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:07,969
Nah, nigga.

845
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,070
(YELLING) Shoot him, baby!

846
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:09,937
One of these bitches.

847
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:10,938
Shoot him, baby.

848
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,339
Shoot him.

849
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,842
Oh, so I guess that's the dumb
bitch you came in here to save.

850
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,276
Watch your fucking mouth, nigga.

851
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:18,146
What the fuck are you
doing back here anyway?

852
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:20,648
I'm going to tell you like I
told them, I came for my bread

853
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:22,750
and I ain't leave
it till I get it.

854
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,885
Look, I told you already.

855
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,720
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

856
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,021
She's fucking lying.

857
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:30,024
I saw her yesterday with
a whole bag of money.

858
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,458
Oh.

859
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,961
So you know where my money at?

860
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:36,430
You better start talking
before I shoot your dumb ass.

861
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:37,965
All right, all right.

862
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,332
The little bitch right.

863
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,969
I found some money in the
kitchen, but I left it there.

864
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,939
I never planned on taking it.

865
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,607
But now that I
think about it, how

866
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,176
do you even know I was up here?

867
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:52,046
I'm the first person to
wake up every morning.

868
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:54,015
Unless your ass was
already up here.

869
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,219
[door opens]

870
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:04,158
[door closes]

871
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,203
I'm the first person to
wake up every morning.

872
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:21,876
I would have heard your
ass coming up the steps.

873
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:24,078
Unless your ass was
already up here.

874
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:32,820
Now that I think about it,
you fucking Paul, ain't you?

875
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,788
What?

876
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:34,956
Bitch, why the
fuck are you lying?

877
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:36,323
I came up here to do laundry.

878
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:39,060
No, the sound I heard
coming up that hallway,

879
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,962
I almost thought it
was Paul getting up.

880
00:37:41,062 --> 00:37:42,997
But now I see.

881
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,465
It was your nasty
ass waking him up.

882
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:46,433
Mona, shut the fuck up.

883
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:47,635
What she talking about, baby?

884
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:48,936
I don't know.

885
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:51,404
But what I do know is I saw
her with the money first.

886
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:52,774
And now it's gone, bitch.

887
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:55,076
One of y'all going to start
talking or I'm fixing to start

888
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,677
shooting in this motherfucker.

889
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:58,746
Why the fuck is you
doing this shit, bro?

890
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:02,349
How the fuck you stack 50 bands
and you supposed to be my dog.

891
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,651
I don't owe you shit, nigga.

892
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,119
You left yourself
high and dry when

893
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,386
you started that damn studio.

894
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,055
You're living in
a fucking fantasy.

895
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:10,224
I don't give a fuck about
none of that shit, no way.

896
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,093
I just came for my bread, dog.

897
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,227
(SINGING) They say.

898
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:15,062
And maybe I admit it, I
got head from an ex-bae.

899
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:15,997
Saw me the next day.

900
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:18,766
Nigga's up in bags
and shit, huh?

901
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:19,366
Fuck you.

902
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,601
[inaudible]

903
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:21,636
Oh, yeah?

904
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:22,236
Yeah?

905
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,006
Simple ass nigga.

906
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,974
All right, you know how
hard I fucked with you.

907
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:29,577
I've been covering your ass
for months just to find out

908
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:31,045
you ain't give a fuck about me.

909
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:31,879
You know what?

910
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:37,785
Nigga, fuck you.

911
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:38,553
Fuck me?

912
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:39,687
No nigga, fuck your bitch.

913
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:42,623
She the one who fucking

914
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:43,958
I could have hit that shit too.

915
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,660
No, no, no.

916
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,828
Oh, yeah?

917
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:47,895
Oh, yeah?

918
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:48,863

919
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:51,866
[clatter]

920
00:38:56,204 --> 00:38:58,105
Get your ass up, nigga.

921
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:00,842
Had this gun all

922
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:04,145
Get your ass out.

923
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:05,079
You know what?

924
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,048
Bro, get the fuck out of here.

925
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:08,216
It ain't even worth it, man.

926
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:09,116
12 already on the way.

927
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,483
Get the fuck out.

928
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:11,586
All right.

929
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:14,088
Shit ain't over though.

930
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,823
Baby, untie me.

931
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,024
Come on.

932
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:17,658
Shit.

933
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:20,561
[breathing heavy]

934
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,398
[knocking on door]

935
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,202
No.

936
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:29,737
Who is it?

937
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:30,571
We good.

938
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,607
[inaudible] fuck you both up.

939
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:34,575
It's the police, man.

940
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,110
Open up this motherfucking door.

941
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,746
Come on, come on.

942
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:43,284
I am Detective Ponytail Tony.

943
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:48,856
And this is my supervisor,
Detective Doo-rag.

944
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:53,493
And uh, oh, Lord.

945
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:58,465
It looks like somebody got
they ass whooped in here.

946
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,067
Potluck, potluck.

947
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,369
OK.

948
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:06,173
I mean, I mean, this must
be where the crime occurred.

949
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:08,542
Yeah, this where he got
his ass whooped right here.

950
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:09,610
Yeah, baby.

951
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,611
No, no, hold on.

952
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:12,380
We ain't-- we ain't
out the woods yet.

953
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,915
I know they're not
serious right now.

954
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:16,317
Look, detective.

955
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:20,755
It's-- listen, let me tell
you, I'm Lieutenant Detective.

956
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:23,090
Look, lieutenant,
look Lieutenant,

957
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,859
y'all going to catch
this man, or what?

958
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,027
Don't worry about that, man.

959
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:26,961
Don't worry.

960
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:28,262
Matter of fact,
what is his name?

961
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:30,398
Joshua Kitchens.

962
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:31,232
Say that again?

963
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:32,300
Joshua Kitchens.

964
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,500
Oh, shit.

965
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,937
Let's get the fuck
up out of here, man.

966
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:36,637
What y'all--

967
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:37,838
And you beat his ass?

968
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:40,241
Hey, y'all acting like
y'all scared or something.

969
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:41,575
Look, let me tell you something.

970
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:42,977
If that's Joshua
Kitchens, he going

971
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:44,045
to deal with this himself.

972
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:45,012
Do you know--

973
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,180
Ain't that the lady?

974
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,417
His grand-mama that we
eat with every Tuesday?

975
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:50,751
Absolutely.

976
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,886
Matter of fact, we're picking
up food from her tonight.

977
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,387
Yeah, we got to pick up
food, tonight though.

978
00:40:53,486 --> 00:40:55,656
I can't, hey, look here--
look, what I'm going to do,

979
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:59,060
though for y'all that's in
here, I'm going to go and get

980
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,860
the CSI.

981
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:01,095
Call CSI, man.

982
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,797
And we're going to
get them to come out

983
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:04,565
and they're going
to make up a report.

984
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:07,335
And then once they make a
report, it go to the general.

985
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:09,937
And then once a general get it,
then he call the lieutenant.

986
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:10,905
[inaudible]

987
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:14,909
That's no help to them.

988
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,978
Y'all need to get the fuck
out this house tonight.

989
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:18,446
Y'all got security systems?

990
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,547
Y'all got security system?

991
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,415
If you don't, you're
motherfucking over.

992
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:22,717
Y'all got security system?

993
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:23,851
Man, C'mon, man.

994
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,086
Y'all-- y'all supposed
to be the damn police.

995
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:26,320
Y'all going to catch
this man or what?

996
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,088
Hey, bro--

997
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:28,356
Hey, we ain't the police.

998
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:30,224
We ain't-- we just need to
connect with other people

999
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:31,225
because right now--

1000
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:32,326
We detectives, we
supposed to check.

1001
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:33,227
Yeah, that's a high level, bro.

1002
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,061
Right, right, right.

1003
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,396
This higher than us.

1004
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,665
Hey, hey, that boy
Kitchen got more warrants

1005
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,267
than the damn police
department can issue.

1006
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:43,070
So we got to get up out of here,
but let me tell you something,

1007
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,171
y'all be safe.

1008
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,007
Don't open that door for nobody.

1009
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,208
No God damn body.

1010
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:49,610
If they don't say CSI,
don't open that door.

1011
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,411
C'mon, man.

1012
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,445
Y'all need to call somebody.

1013
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:52,346
Get the fuck out of
the house tonight.

1014
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:53,280
Yeah, man.

1015
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:54,749
Hey, man-- Them
niggas got them--

1016
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:55,516
Thanks for nothing.

1017
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:57,318
Thanks for fucking nothing.

1018
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:59,553
[music playing]

1019
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:02,556
(SINGING) Just when
I thought I was out,

1020
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:05,192
they pulled me back in.

1021
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,996
Is it too much to ask for love?

1022
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:12,133
Maybe it is when you're
being controlled,

1023
00:42:12,233 --> 00:42:14,735
controlled by a feeling
that can't be seen.

1024
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:18,773
Before we sprout it, the plant,
the seed, the seed of envy,

1025
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:23,177
the seed of jealousy, the seed
of evil and the seed of greed.

1026
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:26,147
Those seeds grew bigger
and later provided

1027
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,115
the social air we breathe.

1028
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:43,964
But the seed of greed
has done its deed

1029
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:47,601
and grew to the heights
that one could believe it.

1030
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:53,474
No one has the courage
to chop it down.

1031
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,051
So Tracy, what the fuck?

1032
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:05,086
Where the money at?

1033
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:06,887
I don't know.

1034
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:08,989
Look, I came back to
the house because I knew

1035
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,225
somebody here had to take it.

1036
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:12,726
Bitch, I thought
you said you didn't

1037
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,563
know where no money was at?

1038
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:16,097
Are you fucking deaf?

1039
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:19,500
I said I took the money,
but I don't got it now.

1040
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,368
So now what?

1041
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,171
Bitch, I should have shot
so sheisty fucking ass.

1042
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,306
Maybe you should of then,

1043
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,173
I should have.

1044
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,374
You know what?

1045
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:29,578
And what was that shit
with you and Paul though?

1046
00:43:29,677 --> 00:43:31,979
You know you can't believe
nothing this cap ass bitch say.

1047
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:32,913
She's fucking crazy.

1048
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:33,814
Fucking lying.

1049
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:34,648
No, you lying.

1050
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:35,850
Get her the fuck out of here.

1051
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,684
You know what?

1052
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:37,751
I'm going to need you to slide.

1053
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,220
Like, I need you to
get the fuck out.

1054
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,522
Eli, are you serious right now?

1055
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,690
I'm going to need you
to get the fuck out.

1056
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,458
So you going to believe
this bitch over me?

1057
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,961
He sound pretty
fucking serious to me.

1058
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:49,263
OK.

1059
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:53,568
Like I said, get the fuck out.

1060
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:54,135
OK.

1061
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:56,871
You know what?

1062
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:58,507
You going to pay
for this shit, nigga

1063
00:43:58,607 --> 00:43:59,940
because you going to really
sit up here and believe

1064
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,142
a bitch like this?

1065
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,511
This lying asshole?

1066
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:05,580
That's how you feel?

1067
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,181
[door opens]

1068
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:10,184
[door shut]

1069
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,998
[music playing]

1070
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:28,570
(SINGING) You're too cold.

1071
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:32,072
You too motherfucking froze.

1072
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:34,842
Bitch, I'm thuggin' but I
got to get some feelings off.

1073
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,043
I might [inaudible].

1074
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:39,880
Hold up, brother,
let me hit you back.

1075
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,382
Why the fuck is you still here?

1076
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:44,018
You're not about to sit up here
and talk to me like I don't pay

1077
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,853
bills in this motherfucker too.

1078
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:47,656
You should have thought
about that shit when

1079
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:48,789
you was fucking Paul.

1080
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:49,857
Fucking Paul?

1081
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:52,293
Didn't I tell you,
I. Did not fuck him.

1082
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:55,196
And I can't believe you going
to believe Mona over me.

1083
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:57,064
Tracy, I don't know what
the fuck to believe.

1084
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:58,732
You grimy enough to
steal from somebody.

1085
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:02,303
How the fuck I know
you ain't fuck Paul?

1086
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:05,072
How the fuck am I
stealing from somebody

1087
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:07,107
and it wasn't even hers?

1088
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,976
You know what, believe this.

1089
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:12,713
Nigga, if I walk out this
door, I ain't coming back.

1090
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,348
Well do it with some
pace in your step.

1091
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:15,449
And get the fuck out.

1092
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,750
Boy, fuck you.

1093
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,718
Oh, yeah?

1094
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:18,886
(SINGING) Bitch,
I'm thugging, but I

1095
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,421
gotta get some feelings off.

1096
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:23,290
I might skirt and hit
the dash on the city cop.

1097
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,926
Sit a girl and get the drop
up on the city [inaudible]..

00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:28,697
well now I fuck with y'all.

1100

Young and [inaudible],,

1101
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:31,899
got to get some feelings off.

1102
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,501
Skirt and I hit the
dash on the city cop.

1103
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:37,238
Sit the girl on the
drop to the city hop.

1104
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,641
Keep talking crazy
about it bitch--

1105
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,643
Yo, Mo, you mind if I
come in for a minute?

1106
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,044
Yeah, you're good.

1107
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:48,516
I just wanted to bring you
your mail and on the real, Mo,

1108
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:50,784
I wish things could have
worked out a little bit better

1109
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:52,654
between us, you know?

1110
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,455
Yeah, me too all right.

1111
00:45:54,556 --> 00:45:57,726
Right because I can't really
afford this place by myself,

1112
00:45:57,825 --> 00:45:59,893
so you know I'm going to
have to make a few moves.

1113
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,799
Well, honestly I hope everything
works out for you, Eli.

1114
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:13,140
Take care of yourself, Mo.

1115
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,643
You too, Eli.

You always out here whining.

[paper crinkling]

1129
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:10,364
Hey auntie Mo-Mo, you already
know who this is by now.

1130
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:13,834
I'm so sorry it took so long for
me to let you know that I'm OK.

1131
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:16,270
I know you've been worried
out of your mind, but--

1132
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,138
but there's no need to worry.

1133
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:19,340
I'm good.

1134
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,509
I just wanted to let you
know how much I love you

1135
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:24,244
and appreciate you.

1136
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:26,080
You're like my second
mother and I'll always

1137
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,248
be grateful for that.

1138
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:30,752
Because of you, I'm becoming
a better, stronger woman

1139
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,386
just like you.

1140
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:34,188
I received your message
and I was on my way

1141
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:37,157
to let you know that I'm so
sorry for what I said to you

1142
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,593
and how I just
walked out on you,

1143
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:42,564
but God had better plans for me.

1144
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:44,098
As I was approaching
the house, I

1145
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:45,966
saw Tracy walk out
the side door and put

1146
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,135
a bag in the back of Eli's car.

1147
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:49,738
She looked worried
and scared and made

1148
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:52,039
me curious to think there
was something in it.

1149
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,907
Something important.

1150
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:55,510
I didn't know what
it could have been,

1151
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,812
but I just heard a
voice in my head say go.

1152
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:59,947
[music playing]

1153
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:01,415
(SINGING) Yeah.

1154
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:02,916
Yeah.

1155
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:03,518
Damn.

1156
00:48:08,857 --> 00:48:10,725
I watch this shit
breaking down my circle,

1158
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,729
Got me learning from my L's
everybody make mistakes.

1159
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,230
Every homie ain't your homie.

1160

00:48:21,836 --> 00:48:23,705
So if you look at
your package, I just

1164
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:26,440
wanted to show you a small
token of appreciation

1165
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:29,476
for being in my life,
just something little

1166
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:32,045
to keep you warm
in this cold world.

1167
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:34,248
I decided to get in my
car and travel wherever

1168

my heart tells me to go.

1169
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,352
I hope I find myself
like I found that bag

1170
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:40,789
and I hope you find it in
your heart to forgive me.
