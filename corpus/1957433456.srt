Short trip. Cuba.

361
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:16,459
You love it there. [laughing]

362
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:18,326
Oh, I love it there?

363
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,426
Hey. Valdo Obruchev.

364
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,159
[Felix] You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

365
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:24,959
- Never heard of him. Two.
- Three.

366
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,026
Ah... It's a good life.

367
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:30,292
[laughs]
You never heard of him?

368
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:32,525
Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

369
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:34,625
Obruchev was kidnapped
three days ago

370
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:36,859
from a secret MI6 lab
in London.

371
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:39,625
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

372
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,026
in Santiago de Cuba.

373
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,658
[Ash] He's leaving out
the best part.

374
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:45,292
Spectre.

375
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:48,226
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

376
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,393
Coincidence?
[clicks tongue]

377
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,459
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

378
00:37:56,892 --> 00:37:57,859
- Three.
- Two.

379
00:37:59,558 --> 00:38:01,959
[Felix laughs]

380
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:03,825
[Ash] You're really
the only guy for the job.

381
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:05,192
[both chuckle]

382
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:08,026
- You're the guy.
- It's my round.

383
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,226
[music continues]

384
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:17,459
Hi.

385
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:23,925
- Scotch.
- Yeah, man.

386
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,226
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

387
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,493
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

388
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:32,493
[Felix] Political appointee.
Not my choice.

389
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,825
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

390
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,326
He smiles too much.

391
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,092
Help us get this
into the right hands.

392
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:40,625
Oh, what,
and you're the right hands?

393
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:42,159
I'm not just a pretty face.

394
00:38:42,192 --> 00:38:45,092
I stopped trusting pretty
faces a long time ago, Felix.

395
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,092
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

396
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:49,525
- Bad judgment.
- Yeah.

397
00:38:49,558 --> 00:38:51,259
Harder to tell
the good from bad,

398
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,892
villains from heroes
these days.

399
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:56,159
I need you, James.

400
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:57,326
You're the only one
I trust with this.

401
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,759
I'm not screwing around.

402
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,092
I wanna get back to my family,

403
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:02,126
tell them
I saved the world again.

404
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:03,859
Don't you?

405
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,625
Nice to see you again, Felix.

406
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:12,493
- At least take my number.
- I've got your number.

407
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:23,725
[muffled music continues]

408
00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:32,493
[engine stalling]

409
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:40,692
[woman] In trouble?

410
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:44,426
Constantly.

411
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:45,825
Need a ride?

412
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,625
Sure. Why not?

413
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,625
Hold on.

414
00:39:57,393 --> 00:39:58,825
- [Bond] What's your name?
- Nomi.

415
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,459
- Yours?
- James. Call me James.

416
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:03,959
- What do you do, Nomi?
- I'm a diver.

417
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:07,592
- What do you dive for?
- I have a thing for old wrecks.

418
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,959
- [chuckles] Well, then you've come to the right place.
- [laughs]

419
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:18,459
[grunts] After you.

420
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,459
[Nomi] Hmm...

421
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:33,692
Nice house.

422
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,859
Thank you.

423
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,026
Is that the bedroom?

424
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,459
Yes, it is.

425
00:40:56,725 --> 00:40:57,725
[switch clicks]

426
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,292
Well,
that's not the first thing

427
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,026
I thought you'd take off,
but, uh...

428
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:05,692
[in British accent] Yeah.

429
00:41:05,725 --> 00:41:08,525
You seem like a man
who's gagging

430
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:12,825
- for some action, Mr. Bond.
- Shall we cut to the chase?

431
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:14,825
I'm here
as a professional courtesy.

432
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:16,126
Well, you're not very
courteous, are you?

433
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,026
You've broken my car...

434
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,192
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

435
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,959
- Double-0?
- Two years.

436
00:41:23,992 --> 00:41:25,326
- Very young.
- High achiever.

437
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,159
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- The world's moved on

438
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,259
since you retired,
Commander Bond.

439
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,292
- Perhaps you didn't notice.
- No, can't say I had.

440
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:35,026
And in my humble opinion,

441
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,625
the world
doesn't change very much.

442
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:38,759
You would say that.

443
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,525
Look,
this all seems like heaven,

444
00:41:40,558 --> 00:41:42,259
this little bubble,
or whatever.

445
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,692
- [laughs]
- But it's so obvious

446
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:45,925
you're a man
who only has time to kill,

447
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:47,825
nothing to live for.

448
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:51,326
So Valdo Obruchev
is off-limits.

449
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,992
You get in my way, I will put
a bullet in your knee.

450
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:56,959
[whispers]
The one that works.

451
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:01,625
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

452
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,692
MI6, CIA
chasing after the same man,

453
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,525
not communicating
with each other, that...

454
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:12,192
- That's not good.
- Hmm.

455
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:15,658
You know what?
Tell M hello, but...

456
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:16,792
I don't work for him anymore.

457
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,159
Tell him yourself.

458
00:42:22,525 --> 00:42:24,493
By the way,

459
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,493
I'm not just any old double-0.

460
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,159
I'm 007.

461
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:33,393
You probably
thought they'd retire it.

462
00:42:35,892 --> 00:42:38,925
- It's just a number.
- [scoffs]

463
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,026
Yeah.

464
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,625
See you in Cuba?

465
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,925
[M] How's it going, Q?

466
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:49,026
Several large files seem
to have been wiped

467
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:50,658
from Obruchev's hard drive.

468
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:53,359
He was working on some
pretty advanced algorithm...

469
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:55,959
- Can you retrieve the files?
- Trying.

470
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:58,259
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

471
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:00,026
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

472
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:02,759
- Thank you, Q. That's all.
- [cell phone ringing]

473
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,525
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

474
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:06,459
007.
Tell them something. Anything.

475
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,459
- 007.
- [Bond] <i>M, darling.</i>

476
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:12,625
<i>Couple of things.</i>

477
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,326
- Bond.
- I met your new 007.

478
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,992
She's a disarming young woman.

479
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:22,092
<i>So, Obruchev.</i>

480
00:43:22,126 --> 00:43:24,026
<i>You kept him
on the payroll, didn't you?</i>

481
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,692
Stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.

482
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:29,159
It does. It's Spectre.

483
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:32,892
Mallory, what have you done?

484
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,692
[cell phone beeps]

485
00:43:35,725 --> 00:43:36,692
[clears throat softly]

486
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:44,692
- Double-0 trouble?
- The CIA have the advantage.

487
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:46,925
Get me Blofeld.

488
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,692
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

489
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,493
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

490
00:43:56,692 --> 00:43:58,959
[Blofeld] <i>They stay</i>
<i>straight in the middle.</i>

491
00:43:58,992 --> 00:44:00,925
<i>And then they bring him up.</i>

492
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,625
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

493
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:06,026
- [Blofeld] <i>It's crowning day.</i>
- Good.

494
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:09,592
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

495
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:13,259
[Blofeld] <i>It's clean as can be.</i>
<i>Everyone just wants a party.</i>

496
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:14,692
<i>Yeah, I want them both
to hear me.</i>

497
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:14,868
[Blofeld laughs]

498
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:15,550
<i>Be a surprise.</i>

499
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,859
[waves lapping]

500
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:33,293
[clicks tongue]

501
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:36,126
[sighs and chuckles]

502
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,759
[typing on cell phone]

503
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:41,126
[line ringing]

504
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:43,458
Felix, I'm in.

505
00:44:43,492 --> 00:44:45,492
[Felix laughs] <i>He's in.</i>

506
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:47,792
<i>There's a young lady
in Santiago I want you to meet.</i>

507
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:07,293
[both speaking Spanish]

508
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:18,193
[chuckles softly]

509
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:21,625
[man speaks Spanish]

510
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:26,692
- [lively music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

511
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,026
Paloma?

512
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:44,059
- You're late. <i>Vamos.</i>
- I...

513
00:45:44,092 --> 00:45:46,892
Uh, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

514
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:48,259
Huh? What hat?

515
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:51,293
[speaking Spanish]

516
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:53,992
[in English] I forget things
when I get nervous.

517
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:55,492
This is the biggest job
I've ever had.

518
00:45:55,525 --> 00:45:56,492
[chuckles]

519
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:10,425
This your room?

520
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:12,625
It's a wine cellar.

521
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:16,293
Okay, come here.

522
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:22,059
Don't you think we ought
to get to know each other

523
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:23,892
just a little bit
before we, um...

524
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:26,492
Oh... [chuckles]
No, no, no, no.

525
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:30,325
Um, no, I'm sorry.
[chuckles] Um...

526
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,126
- All right.
- You do it.

527
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,692
Thank you.

528
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,226
[sighs]

529
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,293
Do you mind, uh...

530
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:46,926
- This is gonna go brilliantly.
- I know.

531
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,092
I've done
three weeks' training.

532
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:52,859
[indistinct chatter]

533
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:12,759
- [speaking Spanish]

- Felix?
- To Felix.

541
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,126

[man] Will this sample
be enough for you?

548
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,425
If he has used it, yes.

549
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,792
It is now progressing.

550
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,692
Oops. Sorry.

Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

Forgive me.

553

Yes.

570
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:20,450
And it looks like all of them.

Cyclops. We ran
into each other in Italy.

575

[Blofeld] <i>Make your way.</i>
<i>Follow the music.</i>

590

00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:36,583
It's perfect.

710
00:59:36,617 --> 00:59:38,051
A perfect what?

711
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:39,583
What? Assassin.

712
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,351
Thank you, Bond,
your mission's done.

713
00:59:41,384 --> 00:59:42,850
- [Bond] Why didn't it kill me?
- You don't have to answer

714
00:59:42,884 --> 00:59:44,884
- those questions. Bond!
- Why Spectre?

715
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:46,784
- Bond, please stop asking these questions.
- Quiet!

716
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,450
Speak up.

717
00:59:48,483 --> 00:59:52,017
Because you were never
the intended target.

718
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:53,784
He was a target? Why?

719
00:59:53,817 --> 00:59:56,217
I changed the DNA
like we decided.

720
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:57,750
Now the plan is complete

721
00:59:57,784 --> 00:59:59,384
- and I'm confused.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

722
00:59:59,418 --> 01:00:01,384
Who is "we"?
Did M make you build this?

723
01:00:01,418 --> 01:00:02,750
He is out of line here, Felix.

724
01:00:02,784 --> 01:00:04,684
Did M order you
to kill Spectre?

725
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:06,384
- Don't answer that!
- Is M behind this?

726
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:07,784
- He is out of line!
- Felix!

727
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:09,550
Ash, shut your mouth!

728
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,583
[Obruchev] M.
M helped me build it.

729
01:00:11,617 --> 01:00:13,617
But please,
he does not have the vision

730
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,017
- for how to use it.
- Well, who does? Who does?

731
01:00:16,051 --> 01:00:19,384
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

732
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:28,617
[Felix] Oh!

733
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,051
[groans]

734
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,583
[both grunting]

735
01:00:52,517 --> 01:00:54,251
[Ash panting]

736
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:04,750
[laughs]

737
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,817
[panting]

738
01:01:16,817 --> 01:01:18,284
I'm with Safin.
You understand?

739
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:20,617
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

740
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,418
[scoffs] I know who you are.

741
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:26,418
I don't know about you,

742
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,217
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

743
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:33,583
We need to have a conversation

744
01:01:33,617 --> 01:01:35,117
about the company you keep.

745
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:36,384
[chuckles] I'm with you.

746
01:01:39,483 --> 01:01:40,483
That's a lot of blood.

747
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:46,617
[Obruchev] So,
where are we going?

748
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,251
[device beeping]

749
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:49,550
Get in the plane, Doctor.

750
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,583
This might be my last mission.

751
01:01:51,617 --> 01:01:53,384
- What do you think?
- I think you're just looking

752
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,051
for an excuse
not to help me.

753
01:01:55,084 --> 01:01:56,884
- [groans]
- There you go.

754
01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:58,850
Paloma, she gave me a cigar
for you to smoke,

755
01:01:58,884 --> 01:02:00,617
and you are gonna smoke it.

756
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,418
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

757
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,117
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

758
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:07,418
I'm gonna find us a way out.

759
01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:11,283
I'll be over here.

760
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:12,850
You know, Felix, we really
need to stop meeting...

761
01:02:12,884 --> 01:02:14,318
[both grunt]

762
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,217
- [Obruchev] Ooh.
- Okay.

763
01:02:22,251 --> 01:02:24,251
I was such
a big fan of his.

764
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:32,217
Felix!

765
01:02:39,617 --> 01:02:41,817
[grunting]

766
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:46,550
This doesn't look good.

767
01:02:47,817 --> 01:02:52,550
Come on, Felix,
we've been in worse than this. Let's go.

768
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:55,583
It's like back when I was
a kid on that shrimp boat.

769
01:02:55,617 --> 01:02:57,583
You're from Milwaukee.

770
01:02:57,617 --> 01:02:59,617
Am I?
I thought I made that up.

771
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:08,450
- He got me.
- [Bond grunts]

772
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:10,917
Just let me go.
Let me go.

773
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:12,550
[Bond grunts]

774
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:19,450
You got this?

775
01:03:22,284 --> 01:03:23,617
Yeah. Yeah.

776
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:27,251
Make it worth it.

777
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:30,017
[Felix coughs]

778
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:32,084
James,

779
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:34,550
it's a good life, isn't it?

780
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,251
The best.

781
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:43,784
Felix.

782
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:48,418
Felix. Felix.

783
01:03:52,151 --> 01:03:53,318
[inhales deeply]

784
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:20,984
[gasping]

785
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:44,550

[ship horn blaring]

787
01:05:10,384 --> 01:05:13,151
[clanking]

788
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:39,251
[engine starts, revs]

789
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:44,251
["James Bond Theme" playing]

790
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,917
- Name?
- Bond.

791
01:06:18,951 --> 01:06:20,418
[types]

792
01:06:22,418 --> 01:06:24,151
James Bond.

793
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:26,717
[typing]

794
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,184
How's retirement?

795
01:06:30,217 --> 01:06:31,284
[scoffs] Quiet.

796
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:37,217
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

797
01:06:37,251 --> 01:06:38,951
I thought you two
would get along.

798
01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:41,583
- Report, 007.
- Thank you.

799
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:44,051
00... 7.

800
01:06:45,984 --> 01:06:47,217
That must bother you.

801
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:52,084
Where is he?

802
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:53,850
He left me for somebody else.

803
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,217
It's, uh...

804
01:06:55,251 --> 01:06:56,951
- So, you lost him?
- You can go in.

805
01:06:56,984 --> 01:06:59,351
- Thank you.
- Thank y...

806
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:00,650
[Moneypenny]
Alone, I'm afraid.

807
01:07:02,384 --> 01:07:03,384
Oh, does that bother you?

808
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:09,450
[Nomi grunts]

809
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:11,884
I get why you shot him.

810
01:07:11,917 --> 01:07:13,051
[Moneypenny] Yeah, well,

811
01:07:13,084 --> 01:07:15,318
everyone tries at least once.

812
01:07:16,418 --> 01:07:18,418
[pen clicking]

813
01:07:19,717 --> 01:07:22,318
Has this desk got bigger?

814
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,951
Or have you got smaller?

815
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,850
I can't pretend there
weren't some sorry faces

816
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,251
when you left us, Bond,

817
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:35,017
but you fell
so far off the grid

818
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,251
that we thought
you must be dead.

819
01:07:38,217 --> 01:07:39,418
Now, learning that you

820
01:07:40,884 --> 01:07:43,251
were, in fact,
alive and well, and...

821
01:07:45,151 --> 01:07:47,384
working for the CIA, well...

822
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:52,418
Well, that really was a blow.

823
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:55,418
Well,
they just asked so nicely.

824
01:07:57,217 --> 01:07:59,784
It's a shame that you
haven't lost your touch.

825
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:02,750
[sighs]
We wouldn't be in this mess.

826
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,583
This is your mess.

827
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,251
Blofeld tried to kill me
in Cuba,

828
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,151
but someone hijacked his plan.

829
01:08:12,284 --> 01:08:14,217
And whoever stole your weapon

830
01:08:14,251 --> 01:08:17,117
used it
to wipe out Spectre instead.

831
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:19,951
Now your weapon is on the run

832
01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:22,784
and nobody seems
to know who has it.

833
01:08:22,817 --> 01:08:24,917
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

834
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:26,450
We're looking into it.

835
01:08:26,483 --> 01:08:28,550
I can identify
the man that took Obruchev.

836
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,051
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

837
01:08:31,384 --> 01:08:32,450
Blofeld.

838
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,784
Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.

839
01:08:34,817 --> 01:08:37,384
Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting

840
01:08:37,418 --> 01:08:39,550
in Cuba from Belmarsh.

841
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,117
- How?
- No.

842
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,951
How?
No one has access. No one.

843
01:08:43,984 --> 01:08:47,750
Why didn't you shut it down?

844
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:49,583
Why didn't you
shut Heracles down?

845
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:52,550
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

846
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:56,184
- And to Felix Leiter?
- I certainly don't answer to Felix Leiter.

847
01:08:56,217 --> 01:08:58,117
Perhaps because he's dead.

848
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:06,251
I'm sorry.

849
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:09,817
I had a lot of respect
for Leiter.

850
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:11,817
[sighs]

851
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:18,583
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

852
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:20,617
- Get me into Belmarsh.
- No.

853
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:23,084
Blofeld's the only member
of Spectre still breathing,

854
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,617
- I can't risk that.
- Oh, but you will

855
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:27,251
risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

856
01:09:27,284 --> 01:09:30,017
with a corrupt scientist
for ten years?

857
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:32,384
There was nothing
to suggest that Obruchev

858
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,384
was working for anyone else.
I had him...

859
01:09:34,418 --> 01:09:36,384
My God,
you're thirsty at the moment.

860
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:41,017
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

861
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:44,750
You have no right to make
insinuations about my judgment.

862
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:49,017
If you've nothing left
to give, you are irrelevant.

863
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,850
You've done your bit and we
thank you for your service,

864
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:53,217
again. Goodbye.

865
01:09:55,051 --> 01:09:57,617
- [beeps]
- Moneypenny, send in 007.

866
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,717
You can go, Bond.

867
01:10:06,217 --> 01:10:07,750
It's definitely the same desk.

868
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:13,750
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

869
01:10:18,084 --> 01:10:20,384
- [door closes]
- Go to Belmarsh.

870
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:22,884
I want everything
that Blofeld listens to,

871
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,217
looks at and touches scanned.

872
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:26,951
Scan every corner
of that cell.

873
01:10:26,984 --> 01:10:28,783
Scan the whole prison.

874
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:31,617
In fact,
scan the whole damn man.

875
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:34,251
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

876
01:10:38,051 --> 01:10:40,251
[Moneypenny] James...
Uh...

877
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:44,084
What are you doing for dinner?

- Hello, Q. I've missed you.

886
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,450
[Moneypenny] Mm!
That smells great.

887
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,251
- Were you expecting somebody?
- [door closes]

888
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:23,884
Um... No. What...
Excuse me.

889
01:11:25,084 --> 01:11:26,917
Oh.

890
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:30,617
This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes,

891
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,251
I can't take my focus off...

892
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:33,850
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

893
01:11:33,884 --> 01:11:35,583
No, I need to lay the table.

894
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:37,450
[cat meows]

895
01:11:37,483 --> 01:11:39,617
[soft operatic music playing
on speaker]

896
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,084
You know,
they come with fur these days.

897
01:11:42,117 --> 01:11:45,617
I want to be very clear that I
am not authorized to help you.

898
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,784
- And I have sworn...
- It's to do with Heracles.

899
01:11:50,717 --> 01:11:52,784
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

900
01:11:52,817 --> 01:11:55,550
No, but there's something
going on, Q.

901
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:56,750
We need to find out
what it is.

902
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:02,784
[clicks tongue, sighs]

903
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:04,284
Well, it's never
9:00 to 5:00, is it?

904
01:12:05,884 --> 01:12:07,384
[Bond] Thank you.

905
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,617
- Um, Bond?
- [Bond] Yes?

906
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,051
Do you know
where this has been?

907
01:12:16,084 --> 01:12:17,418
Everywhere, I should imagine.

908
01:12:18,884 --> 01:12:19,951
[Q] Into the sandbox.

909
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:26,084
Oh. Thank you.

910
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:30,450
- [Bond clears throat]
- [Q] Um, it's a database.

911
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:32,884
Don't touch that, please.

912
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:34,217
[Bond] What's the data?

913
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:36,550
[Q] It's DNA.
Multiple individuals.

914
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:38,184
What was M working on?

915
01:12:38,217 --> 01:12:40,184
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

916
01:12:40,217 --> 01:12:41,951
- [Q] Oh, hello.
- [Bond] What?

917
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:44,284
[Q] There's more.
Hidden files.

918
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:47,217
I was asked to recover
what I could

919
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:49,951
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

920
01:12:49,984 --> 01:12:51,750
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

921
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:55,884
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.

922
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:03,284
So, Obruchev is working
for someone

923
01:13:03,318 --> 01:13:04,717
who managed
to kill all of Spectre?

924
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,217
Not all of them.

925
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,117
[Moneypenny] Blofeld.

926
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,717
Can you show me
the other files?

927
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,151
[Q] Mm-hmm.

928
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:19,984
[Q] Wait,
this can't just be Spectre.

929
01:13:21,284 --> 01:13:24,951
Oh, my God.
There are thousands.

930
01:13:26,617 --> 01:13:27,617
Who are they?

931
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:30,418
They're in categories.

932
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,450
I'm gonna need
more time to organize...

933
01:13:32,483 --> 01:13:34,284
There have been, uh, breaches

934
01:13:34,318 --> 01:13:37,051
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

935
01:13:38,284 --> 01:13:40,483
- We've been tracking them.
- Ours?

936
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:41,951
I can't imagine
they're leaving us out,

937
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,750
whoever they are.

938
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:45,951
Well, Blofeld
will know who they are.

939
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,284
Q, you need to get me
into Belmarsh.

940
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,784
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

941
01:13:52,817 --> 01:13:55,684
Who? M says no one has access.

942
01:13:55,717 --> 01:13:57,784
- Really?
- Did he?

943
01:13:57,817 --> 01:13:59,351
What's that?

944
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:01,017
[oven dings]

945
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:03,084
Can I just have
one nice evening, please,

946
01:14:03,117 --> 01:14:04,184
before the world explodes?

947
01:14:04,217 --> 01:14:06,384
Who has access? Who?

948
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:15,117
- [woman] Morning.
- [Madeleine] Morning.

949
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:18,184
[woman] New patient.
He's weird.

950
01:14:18,217 --> 01:14:19,884
[Madeleine]
You can't say that.

951
01:14:25,951 --> 01:14:26,917
I'm sorry I'm late.

952
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:29,550
[door closes]

953
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,251
I wasn't expecting
a new patient.

954
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:38,951
Sorry if I surprised you.

955
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,784
No. I like surprises.

956
01:14:45,617 --> 01:14:48,583
[man] You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

957
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,750
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

958
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,450
They are usually more
of a danger to themselves.

959
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:03,217
Foxgloves.

960
01:15:03,951 --> 01:15:05,051
Beautiful.

961
01:15:06,483 --> 01:15:08,184
- Did you choose them?
- Yes.

962
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:09,951
I found them friendly.

963
01:15:09,984 --> 01:15:11,617
You know if you eat them

964
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,917
they can cause your heart
to just...

965
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:17,917
stop.

966
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:19,117
[chuckles softly]

967
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:20,984
Then I'll make sure not to.

968
01:15:28,784 --> 01:15:30,051
Do you know a lot
about flowers?

969
01:15:30,084 --> 01:15:32,750
My father had a garden.

970
01:15:32,784 --> 01:15:34,017
He taught me.

971
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:39,384
He died when I was young,
but my interest remained.

972
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,884
It's difficult
to lose a parent.

973
01:15:44,284 --> 01:15:45,550
Especially at a young age.

974
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,951
Yes,

975
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:51,750
death has a particular
effect on children,

976
01:15:53,217 --> 01:15:54,051
doesn't it?

977
01:15:57,217 --> 01:15:58,784
What effect
did it have on you?

978
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,784
Profound.

979
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:03,617
But I saved a life once.

980
01:16:05,284 --> 01:16:06,884
I think that had
more of an effect.

981
01:16:08,817 --> 01:16:09,784
Why is that?

982
01:16:09,817 --> 01:16:12,384
Saving someone's life

983
01:16:12,418 --> 01:16:16,650
connects you to them forever,
the same as taking it.

984
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:19,750
They belong to you.

985
01:16:24,617 --> 01:16:27,084
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

986
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:29,217
so I brought a memory box.

987
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:35,117
I thought
it might interest you.

988
01:16:35,151 --> 01:16:38,418
Sometimes objects can be
more evocative than memories.

989
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:46,750
[breathing shakily]

990
01:16:50,384 --> 01:16:53,251
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

991
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:56,984
They needed me.

992
01:16:59,318 --> 01:17:02,550
It is a shock to see them
so many years later.

993
01:17:04,884 --> 01:17:06,051
They still need me.

994
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:09,684
I am rather taken by them.

995
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:11,884
- What do you want?
- Just a favor.

996
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:14,117
You owe me.

997
01:17:15,384 --> 01:17:17,017
You murdered my mother.

998
01:17:17,051 --> 01:17:20,084
And your father
killed my entire family.

999
01:17:22,884 --> 01:17:24,684
Parents.

1000
01:17:24,717 --> 01:17:28,084
I need you to visit someone for
me, wearing this.

1001
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:31,384
It's harmless to you.

1002
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,217
You are the only one
who can do it.

1003
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,583
No.

1004
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:43,450
Why would I do
anything for you?

1005
01:17:43,483 --> 01:17:49,951
Because I am a man willing to
kill the person you love most.

1006
01:17:49,984 --> 01:17:52,284
I've already lost everyone
I've ever loved.

1007
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:55,650
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

1008
01:17:58,284 --> 01:18:00,617
That is very sad to hear,
Madeleine.

1009
01:18:06,284 --> 01:18:07,717
But it is not true...

1010
01:18:13,217 --> 01:18:14,284
is it?

1011
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:24,750
[Bond]
Madeleine Swann, really?

1012
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:27,251
[M] Well, yes. We took
your information seriously,

1013
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:30,384
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.

1014
01:18:30,418 --> 01:18:32,550
Well, she's very smart and
very good at hiding things.

1015
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:33,850
She's a useful asset.

1016
01:18:33,884 --> 01:18:36,850
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

1017
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:38,450
I had to exercise
my judgment...

1018
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:39,750
Your judgment is the problem.

1019
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,917
That weapon was designed
to save lives

1020
01:18:43,951 --> 01:18:46,617
and to eradicate collateral
damage for our agents.

1021
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:50,483
A clean,
accurate shot every time.

1022
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:53,251
But it had to be off the books.

1023
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,884
There are enough holes
in our national security.

1024
01:18:58,583 --> 01:19:00,450
[sighs] If the world knows
what this can do...

1025
01:19:00,483 --> 01:19:02,550
- They'd kill for it.
- Mm.

1026
01:19:03,418 --> 01:19:04,384
Look...

1027
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:11,151
If it's an error, it's on my
shoulders, fair and square.

1028
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:15,550
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

1029
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:19,750
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

1030
01:19:19,784 --> 01:19:21,084
Of this.

1031
01:19:23,117 --> 01:19:25,450
But we used to be able to get
into a room with the enemy,

1032
01:19:25,483 --> 01:19:26,617
we could look him in the eye.

1033
01:19:27,617 --> 01:19:28,750
And now the...

1034
01:19:30,984 --> 01:19:34,217
The enemy
is just floating in the ether.

1035
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:35,617
We don't even know
what they're after.

1036
01:19:36,817 --> 01:19:37,984
Blofeld.

1037
01:19:39,617 --> 01:19:42,117
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

1038
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:43,251
"We"?

1039
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:46,750
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1040
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,284
I see.

1041
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,483
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

1042
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:55,216
Well, it's hard to say.

1043
01:19:55,251 --> 01:19:56,884
I mean,
I would imagine world leaders,

1044
01:19:56,917 --> 01:20:00,251
innocent civilians, freedom,
you know, that sort of thing.

1045
01:20:00,284 --> 01:20:03,017
Oh, good,
well, just the usual.

1046
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:04,617
Just the usual.

1047
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:05,784
[chuckles]

1048
01:20:08,483 --> 01:20:11,217
Blofeld was communicating
with his agents in Cuba

1049
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:15,117
through a bionic eye
which we've now retrieved.

1050
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:17,550
You're welcome.

1051
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:21,418
Spectre's destruction's going
to have huge consequences.

1052
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:24,784
Whoever did this is going to be
very dangerous and very powerful.

1053
01:20:27,117 --> 01:20:29,951
We need all the information
that we can gather.

1054
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:31,151
Sir.

1055
01:20:32,384 --> 01:20:33,251
[Tanner] Sir.

1056
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:36,284
Bond.

1057
01:20:37,318 --> 01:20:40,117
So the rumors are true.
You look well.

1058
01:20:40,151 --> 01:20:41,217
Tanner.

1059
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:43,984
Sir,
there's been a development.

1060
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:47,884
[Nomi] They were
just dropping,

1061
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,184
one right after the other.

1062
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:52,217
It was disturbing,
to say the least.

1063
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:54,817
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

1064
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,951
- Uh, Bond's in the office.
- [Q] What?

1065
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:05,184
Oh, Bond. My God,
I haven't seen you in, in, uh...

1066
01:21:05,217 --> 01:21:06,850
- How is your retirement?
- Shut up, Q.

1067
01:21:06,884 --> 01:21:08,717
I know he's staying with you.

1068
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,550
And you're not
in the clear either.

1069
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,784
- What happened?
- He's been reinstated as a double-0.

1070
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:17,483
- Double-0 what?
- What have you got?

1071
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,117
Q has studied
the blood samples I gathered

1072
01:21:22,151 --> 01:21:23,750
from the victims
of the funeral.

1073
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:25,784
Just look at this.

1074
01:21:25,817 --> 01:21:28,051
- [typing]
- [M] What are we looking at?

1075
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:29,117
[Tanner] This is the funeral

1076
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:31,784
of one of the dead
Spectre agents from Cuba.

1077
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:33,684
[Nomi] And here are
the members of their family

1078
01:21:33,717 --> 01:21:36,784
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

1079
01:21:36,817 --> 01:21:39,384
We found Heracles in the
blood samples of all of them.

1080
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:43,550
[M] Now,
that's some good work, Nomi.

1081
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:45,550
Thank you, sir. Double-0 what?

1082
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:49,051
- What are they?
- They're... They're nanobots.

1083
01:21:50,717 --> 01:21:51,817
Right.

1084
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:54,117
[Q] Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

1085
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:55,884
by the slightest contact
with your skin.

1086
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,650
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

1087
01:22:06,884 --> 01:22:08,251
Heracles was...

1088
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:13,884
It was designed to be the most
efficient weapon in our arsenal.

1089
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:15,884
Passing through
people harmlessly

1090
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:18,184
before reaching
its intended target.

1091
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:20,418
[Q] But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

1092
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,750
so that they can kill anyone
related to the target.

1093
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:24,684
- Anyone?
- Well, since it's DNA-based,

1094
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:26,284
with further modifications,
yes.

1095
01:22:27,251 --> 01:22:30,384
Families,
certain genetic traits.

1096
01:22:30,418 --> 01:22:32,951
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

1097
01:22:32,984 --> 01:22:35,750
that could target a range
from individuals to...

1098
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,217
whole ethnicities.

1099
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:39,550
You infect enough people...

1100
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:41,418
And the people
become the weapon.

1101
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:44,550
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

1102
01:22:46,418 --> 01:22:47,284
It was...

1103
01:22:50,217 --> 01:22:51,750
I need to call
the Prime Minister.

1104
01:22:52,817 --> 01:22:55,384
Tanner, quarantine
the families from the funeral.

1105
01:22:55,418 --> 01:22:57,084
- Yes, sir.
- [M] And, Q,

1106
01:22:57,117 --> 01:22:58,884
hack into Blofeld's bionic eye,

1107
01:22:58,917 --> 01:23:00,217
see what you can find.

1108
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:03,284
- [door closes]
- You've got your wish.

1109
01:23:03,318 --> 01:23:06,351
Go to Blofeld and see
what you can get out of him.

1110
01:23:06,384 --> 01:23:08,384
And find
that cockroach Obruchev.

1111
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:10,550
Sir.

1112
01:23:14,084 --> 01:23:16,251
We don't have a trail.

1113
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:19,784
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

1114
01:23:19,817 --> 01:23:21,917
Find him,
you'll find Obruchev.

1115
01:23:21,951 --> 01:23:23,117
Um...

1116
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:25,850
Good luck.

1117
01:23:25,884 --> 01:23:28,084

[Nomi clears throat]

1120
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:55,284
I'll be outside
when you're done

1121
01:23:55,318 --> 01:23:56,951
with your important
preparation.

1122
01:23:59,717 --> 01:24:00,951
I'll be just a moment.

1123
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:03,318

but we've kept a close eye

1129

She's been very compliant.

1130

If Bond does
anything weird in there,

1131
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,084
you'll be doing me
a huge favor,

1132
01:24:43,117 --> 01:24:45,351

for him, okay?

1133
01:24:45,384 --> 01:24:46,750
Okay.

1134

He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

Hello, Blofeld.

1181
01:27:58,051 --> 01:28:00,617
Perhaps you can help me.

1182
01:28:02,984 --> 01:28:04,583
Cuba was quite the party.

1183
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:07,217
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thank you.

1184
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:09,384
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

1185
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:13,217
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

1186
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:15,550
with the world's
most powerful people,

1187
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:19,550
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,

1188
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:22,251
and your hands on the most
valuable weapon in existence.

1189
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,884
It's like a...

1190
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:29,418
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

1191
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:33,951
A celebration of all
that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

1192
01:28:33,984 --> 01:28:36,084
- [chuckles] Yeah, James.
- [chuckling]

1193
01:28:37,784 --> 01:28:39,617
Yeah.

1194
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:42,251
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?

1195
01:28:44,251 --> 01:28:47,418
My sweet James,
what do you want?

1196
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,984
Your enemies
are closing in, Blofeld.

1197
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,184
And the biggest twist here

1198
01:28:52,217 --> 01:28:54,650
is that if you tell me
who they are,

1199
01:28:55,984 --> 01:28:57,450
I could save your life.

1200
01:28:57,483 --> 01:29:00,583

the wrong question.

1231
01:30:20,217 --> 01:30:21,583
Two old men in a hole

1232
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:23,817
trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

1233
01:30:27,251 --> 01:30:30,051
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

1234
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:32,251
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

1235
01:30:32,284 --> 01:30:33,850
She is irrelevant.

1236
01:30:33,884 --> 01:30:37,251
Mm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

1237
01:30:37,284 --> 01:30:40,550
You said it yourself,
she's very good at hiding things.

1238
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:44,884
And when her secret finds its way
out, and it will,

1239
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:46,418
it'll be the death of you.

1240
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:48,550
Just give me a name.

1241
01:30:48,583 --> 01:30:50,418
- Madeleine.
- [scoffs]

1242
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:53,550
Please, just...
Please, no games.

1243
01:30:55,051 --> 01:30:56,084
Madeleine.

1244
01:30:58,117 --> 01:31:01,017
Oh, do you know what?
The two of you should come see me.

1245
01:31:01,051 --> 01:31:03,051
A little couples therapy.

1246
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:06,184
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

1247
01:31:06,217 --> 01:31:09,384
Just tell me
who they are, Blofeld...

1248
01:31:11,418 --> 01:31:14,117
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

1249
01:31:14,151 --> 01:31:16,017
No, I don't want you to leave.

1250
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:17,418
We're just getting
reacquainted.

1251
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,207
Hmm. All right. Come.

1252
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:28,457
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

1253
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,260
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

1254
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,800
Careful, Bond.

1255
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:40,633
It was me.

1256
01:31:42,568 --> 01:31:45,167
- You destroyed Spectre?
- [snorts] No.

1257
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:47,167
Vesper's grave.

1258
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:49,267
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

1259
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:51,234
I knew you'd come visit it,

1260
01:31:51,267 --> 01:31:54,101
I just needed to wait
for the <i>bon moment.</i>

1261
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:55,600
She led you straight there

1262
01:31:55,633 --> 01:31:57,733
from the goodness
of her heart.

1263
01:31:57,767 --> 01:32:00,733
And then you left her, for me.

1264
01:32:00,767 --> 01:32:03,034
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, but it does.

1265
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:05,067
She still does, doesn't she?

1266
01:32:05,101 --> 01:32:07,234
My poor little cuckoo.

1267
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,534
You were always so very,
very sensitive.

1268
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,067
<i>This isn't working.</i>

1269
01:32:16,101 --> 01:32:17,367
Keep going.

1270
01:32:17,401 --> 01:32:19,234
[Blofeld] <i>All this wasted time,</i>

1271
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,101
the life you could have had.

1272
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:24,101
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful,

1273
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:25,934
so exquisitely beautiful,

1274
01:32:25,967 --> 01:32:28,568
is that you're coming
to me looking for answers,

1275
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,600
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

1276
01:32:31,633 --> 01:32:35,034
It's Madeleine. She holds
the secrets you need.

1277
01:32:35,067 --> 01:32:37,767
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.

1278
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,501
I'd already broken you.

1279
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:41,800
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

1280
01:32:43,234 --> 01:32:45,434
like the one you gave me.

1281
01:32:45,468 --> 01:32:47,267
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

1282
01:32:48,568 --> 01:32:49,733
Eh, almost.

1283
01:32:58,201 --> 01:32:59,034
[softly] Die.

1284
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,700
[Blofeld] Hmm?

1285
01:33:04,401 --> 01:33:06,501
- [Bond] Die, Blofeld. Die.
- [choking]

1286
01:33:06,534 --> 01:33:08,034
Jesus. Open the door.

1287
01:33:09,767 --> 01:33:12,234
- [banging on door]
- Bond! Bond! Bond!

1288
01:33:12,267 --> 01:33:16,367
- [banging on door continues]
- Open the door. Bond!

1289
01:33:16,401 --> 01:33:17,900
- Cuckoo.
- [door buzzes open]

1290
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:19,067
What the hell
are you thinking?

1291
01:33:19,101 --> 01:33:20,834
Yes, yes, yes, I know how
to interrogate an asset.

1292
01:33:20,867 --> 01:33:23,733
- This interrogation is over.
- Tanner, don't lecture me!

1293
01:33:23,767 --> 01:33:26,267
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1294
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:27,900
in the whole bloody playbook.

1295
01:33:27,934 --> 01:33:29,134
[thudding]

1296
01:33:34,434 --> 01:33:35,468
Don't move.

1297
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,568
I'm... I'm gonna need those,
I'm afraid.

1298
01:33:59,568 --> 01:34:00,401
He's dead.

1299
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:05,267
It's a good thing
you're not actually related,

1300
01:34:05,301 --> 01:34:06,367
or you'd be dead too.

1301
01:34:07,867 --> 01:34:10,201
- How do I get this off?
- [Q] Oh, you don't. You can't.

1302
01:34:12,067 --> 01:34:15,101
[sighs] Nanobots aren't just
for Christmas.

1303
01:34:15,134 --> 01:34:19,301
[chuckles] Once Heracles is in your
system, it's there forever.

1304
01:34:24,934 --> 01:34:26,501
Did they find the car?

1305
01:34:26,534 --> 01:34:28,334
We traced it,
but she abandoned it.

1306
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:30,700
They searched her flat,
she hasn't been home.

1307
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:34,101
- Is she one of them?
- I don't know.

1308
01:34:34,134 --> 01:34:38,201
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1309
01:34:39,867 --> 01:34:42,101
No. I don't know her at all.

1310
01:35:28,767 --> 01:35:30,301
[Madeleine] Is that for me?

1311
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,800
No.

1312
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,101
Then why did you come?

1313
01:35:39,101 --> 01:35:40,568
Because you told me to.

1314
01:35:42,434 --> 01:35:45,101
I didn't think you
would remember.

1315
01:35:45,134 --> 01:35:46,834
I remember everything.

1316
01:35:46,867 --> 01:35:49,367
You need to tell me who gave
you the poison, Madeleine.

1317
01:35:51,534 --> 01:35:52,568
Is he dead?

1318
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,101
Yes, he's dead.

1319
01:35:56,201 --> 01:35:57,367
Good.

1320
01:36:00,367 --> 01:36:01,534
He told me
you didn't betray me.

1321
01:36:03,934 --> 01:36:05,733
I understand you're not built
to trust people.

1322
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,967
- Neither are you.
- Then we were fools for trying.

1323
01:36:12,101 --> 01:36:13,367
I wanted to.

1324
01:36:20,534 --> 01:36:22,700
I don't know if you wanted me
to come here,

1325
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:25,834
or why you tried
to kill Blofeld,

1326
01:36:25,867 --> 01:36:27,434
or who gave you
the poison to do it,

1327
01:36:27,468 --> 01:36:28,568
or how long you've been
working for them,

1328
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,101
but I do know...

1329
01:36:32,767 --> 01:36:37,334
that for what felt
like five minutes of my life

1330
01:36:37,367 --> 01:36:39,468
I wanted everything with you.

1331
01:36:42,067 --> 01:36:44,401
And it's not
because I didn't trust.

1332
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:49,134
It was just that feeling.

1333
01:36:53,568 --> 01:36:56,401
I know I've come here to find
out who gave you the poison.

1334
01:36:58,201 --> 01:37:00,600
But I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1335
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,568
that I have loved you,

1336
01:37:05,034 --> 01:37:07,000
and I will love you,

1337
01:37:07,034 --> 01:37:10,900
and I do not regret
a single moment of my life

1338
01:37:10,934 --> 01:37:12,201
that led me to you.

1339
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:16,967
Except when I put you
on that train.

1340
01:37:21,967 --> 01:37:23,367
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1341
01:37:25,633 --> 01:37:26,934
My timing?

1342
01:37:29,401 --> 01:37:30,401
Don't.

1343
01:37:38,967 --> 01:37:41,201
My sense of humor?

1344
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,733
Don't.

1345
01:37:47,767 --> 01:37:50,334
- What?
- You look...

1346
01:37:50,367 --> 01:37:51,767
You look incredible.

1347
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:00,900
[soft clink]

1348
01:38:04,301 --> 01:38:06,101
[whispers] This is Mathilde.

1349
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:09,234
Um...

1350
01:38:09,934 --> 01:38:11,700
Hello. I'm James.

1351
01:38:11,733 --> 01:38:13,367
[clinking]

1352
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:33,367
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1353
01:38:33,401 --> 01:38:35,367
- Well done, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

1354
01:38:35,401 --> 01:38:37,101
Permission
for a capture or kill.

1355
01:38:37,134 --> 01:38:38,767
Have we cleared this
with the Americans?

1356
01:38:40,301 --> 01:38:42,401
Granted.
And thank you for asking.

1357
01:38:42,434 --> 01:38:44,367
By the book, sir.

1358
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:46,367
Well, your predecessor
was less deferential.

1359
01:38:47,568 --> 01:38:51,167
To be fair,
Commander Bond gave me the lead.

1360
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:53,733
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1361
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:55,367
- <i>Sir.</i>
- [line disconnects]

1362
01:38:55,401 --> 01:38:56,633
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1363
01:38:57,733 --> 01:38:59,534
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1364
01:38:59,568 --> 01:39:00,600
Thank you.

1365
01:39:02,733 --> 01:39:04,201

[Madeleine speaks French]

1370
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,700
[in English] She's not yours.

1371
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:34,767
But, um, the...

1372
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,234
Okay, the blue eyes, the...

1373
01:39:37,967 --> 01:39:39,201
She's not yours.

1374
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,434
Okay.

1375
01:39:44,034 --> 01:39:45,201
I have something to show you.

1376
01:39:48,767 --> 01:39:50,267
Another child?

1377

[keypad beeping]

1378
01:39:52,434 --> 01:39:53,934
[rapid beeping]

1379
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,700
[Bond] What is it with
your dad and secret rooms?

1380
01:40:04,733 --> 01:40:05,700
Talk to me.

1381
01:40:07,034 --> 01:40:08,401
I wanted
to bring you here before.

1382
01:40:09,934 --> 01:40:11,401
To tell you everything.

1383
01:40:12,867 --> 01:40:14,501
Blofeld ordered my father

1384
01:40:14,534 --> 01:40:16,367
to assassinate this family.

1385
01:40:16,401 --> 01:40:18,134
The boy survived.

1386
01:40:20,067 --> 01:40:21,600
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1387
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:28,401
When I was a little girl,
he came here to kill my father.

1388
01:40:30,534 --> 01:40:32,434
But he found me
and my mother instead.

1389
01:40:34,934 --> 01:40:35,900
He spared my life.

1390
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:40,000
And now he's back.

1391
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,568
- And what does he want?
- Revenge.

1392
01:40:45,034 --> 01:40:46,034
Me.

1393
01:40:51,867 --> 01:40:54,700
- Who were they?
- Spectre's poisoners.

1394
01:40:54,733 --> 01:40:56,767
My father held
a banquet for them,

1395
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,501
used their own recipe
in the dessert.

1396
01:40:59,534 --> 01:41:00,468
Dioxin.

1397
01:41:02,367 --> 01:41:04,334
They would have
suffered horribly.

1398
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:05,700
Scarred him for life.

1399
01:41:07,267 --> 01:41:08,434
The family had an island.

1400
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:12,367
They called it
the Poison Garden.

1401
01:41:13,633 --> 01:41:15,101
Oh, so...

1402
01:41:15,134 --> 01:41:17,767
Blofeld took it from them,

1403
01:41:19,134 --> 01:41:21,201
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1404
01:41:27,201 --> 01:41:30,568
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

some images of him as a boy.

And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1408
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,401
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1409
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:47,967
I'll send you
my location shortly.

1410
01:41:52,568 --> 01:41:54,201
You're going to find him?

1411
01:41:56,568 --> 01:41:59,900
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1412
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:04,401
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

- No.

1577
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:57,301
I can protect her.

1578
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:02,700
Mathilde.

1579
01:58:02,733 --> 01:58:04,234
[speaking French]

1580
01:58:12,134 --> 01:58:13,667
Mathilde.

1581
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:15,534
[Safin] It's a poison garden...

1582
01:58:16,967 --> 01:58:18,900
but it's perfectly safe.

1583
01:58:18,934 --> 01:58:21,201
[shushes]

1584
01:58:21,234 --> 01:58:23,367
[Safin] My father made this.

1585
01:58:23,401 --> 01:58:27,101
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1586
01:58:30,401 --> 01:58:32,201
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1587
01:58:36,367 --> 01:58:39,167
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1588
01:58:39,201 --> 01:58:41,568
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1589
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:44,468
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1590
01:58:51,301 --> 01:58:52,468
Mathilde!

1591
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,633
No.

1592
01:58:56,134 --> 01:58:58,034
This one makes you do
as you're told,

1593
01:58:59,434 --> 01:59:00,934
so you never misbehave,

1594
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:02,600
and you're always good.

1595
01:59:02,633 --> 01:59:04,600
You mustn't misbehave,
Mathilde.

1596
01:59:06,134 --> 01:59:07,700
And neither must your mother.

1597
01:59:10,367 --> 01:59:11,367
Ever.

1598
01:59:14,867 --> 01:59:17,033
- Do you like it here?
- [Mathilde] No.

1599
01:59:18,401 --> 01:59:19,534
Well, you will learn to.

1600
01:59:20,733 --> 01:59:21,733
I grew up here,

1601
01:59:21,767 --> 01:59:22,934
and you will too.

1602
01:59:22,967 --> 01:59:24,401
[insects buzzing]

1603
01:59:27,101 --> 01:59:28,767
Such a beautiful child.

1604
01:59:31,733 --> 01:59:33,201
Perhaps we should
have some tea.

1605
01:59:33,234 --> 01:59:34,867
- No.
- Make her see the light.

1606
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,733
[Madeleine] No,
you can't separate us!

1607
01:59:36,767 --> 01:59:37,900
- Mathilde!
- Mama!

1608
01:59:37,934 --> 01:59:38,967
[speaking French]

1609
01:59:43,633 --> 01:59:44,568
Don't worry.

1610
01:59:47,134 --> 01:59:48,134
You have me.

1611
01:59:57,867 --> 01:59:59,900
[Q] <i>As soon as you have</i>
<i>a line of sight on the island,</i>

1612
01:59:59,934 --> 02:00:01,934
<i>drop altitude,
stay below radar.</i>

1613
02:00:06,934 --> 02:00:08,367
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1614
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:10,900
Nope.

1615
02:00:17,767 --> 02:00:19,600
[Q] <i>Don't forget</i>
<i>to release the chute,</i>

1616
02:00:19,633 --> 02:00:21,234
<i>and open the wings.</i>

1617
02:00:21,267 --> 02:00:22,434
<i>Gravity isn't always
your friend.</i>

1618
02:00:39,201 --> 02:00:41,633
<i>Look for a concrete structure
on the west side of the island.</i>

1619
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:44,134
<i>That's your best bet
for getting in.</i>

1620
02:00:52,534 --> 02:00:53,534
[grunts]

1621
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:33,000
[Nomi] Coming up for air, Q.

1622
02:01:33,034 --> 02:01:34,600
[Q] Right, good.

1623
02:01:34,633 --> 02:01:37,534
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1624
02:01:39,067 --> 02:01:40,501
<i>Doesn't seem
to get much activity,</i>

1625
02:01:40,534 --> 02:01:42,034
<i>but look out
for cameras anyway.</i>

1626
02:01:43,234 --> 02:01:44,534
<i>Use your watch, Bond.</i>

1627
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,600
[beeping]

1628
02:01:54,534 --> 02:01:55,501

[beeps]

1631
02:02:19,967 --> 02:02:21,700
Okay. Ah, there you go.

1632
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:26,067
- <i>Sir, they're in.</i>
- Yes, we have it.

1633
02:02:26,101 --> 02:02:28,568
<i>You should be able to see the
chemical plant's architecture.</i>

1634
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:31,633
- [Moneypenny] Which one's Bond?
- [Q] <i>He's the... He's the psi.</i>

1635
02:02:31,667 --> 02:02:35,101
- <i>He's the trident thingy.</i>
- [Bond] <i>Give us the layout.</i>

1636
02:02:35,134 --> 02:02:37,600
Right. [clears throat]

1637
02:02:37,633 --> 02:02:41,101
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1638
02:02:41,134 --> 02:02:44,234
<i>The main activity should
be towards the central hub,</i>

1639
02:02:44,267 --> 02:02:45,367
<i>which is directly above you.</i>

02:03:05,234 --> 02:03:06,900

[indistinct announcement on PA]

1643
02:03:19,034 --> 02:03:20,534
[Q] Bond.

1644
02:03:20,568 --> 02:03:22,267
Bond, there's something...

1645
02:03:22,301 --> 02:03:23,900
There's something
big up ahead,

1646
02:03:23,934 --> 02:03:25,401
<i>I can't work out what it is.
It's...</i>

1647
02:03:25,434 --> 02:03:26,834
[static]

1648
02:03:26,867 --> 02:03:27,967
[Nomi] These walls
must be thick.

1649
02:03:34,568 --> 02:03:35,468
Bond.

1650
02:03:36,934 --> 02:03:39,101
<i>Bond? 007, do you read me?</i>

1651
02:03:39,134 --> 02:03:41,201
[sighs] We've lost them.

1652
02:03:41,234 --> 02:03:43,034
They've entered
a blind spot, sir.

1653
02:03:43,067 --> 02:03:45,101
<i>I can't work out what it is
they've walked into.</i>

1654
02:03:45,134 --> 02:03:46,501
Well, just get them back.

1655
02:03:46,534 --> 02:03:48,367
[PA announcement continues]

1656
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:21,534
[Bond] Well,
will you look at those doors.

1657
02:04:22,534 --> 02:04:24,167
This was a missile silo.

1658
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:25,201
Right.

1659
02:04:27,234 --> 02:04:28,367
Let's go.

1660
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:38,201
[Bond] Everybody, over there!
In the corner! Now!

1661
02:04:38,234 --> 02:04:40,733
- What? How?
- [Bond] Move!

1662
02:04:40,767 --> 02:04:42,434
Move! On the ground!

1663
02:04:44,367 --> 02:04:46,167
Alarm.

1664
02:04:46,201 --> 02:04:47,699
- [Nomi grunts]
- [groans]

1665
02:04:47,733 --> 02:04:48,967
Down, boy.

1666
02:04:51,101 --> 02:04:52,367
[groaning]

1667

[device whirs]

1668
02:05:06,101 --> 02:05:08,600
What... What are you doing?

1669
02:05:08,633 --> 02:05:12,167
You cannot explode
laboratory, please.

1670
02:05:12,201 --> 02:05:14,201
- [groans]
- [device whirs]

1671
02:05:16,067 --> 02:05:20,201
This is suicide mission.
Come on.

1672
02:05:20,234 --> 02:05:22,534
You will never leave
this island alive.

1673
02:05:29,201 --> 02:05:30,134
[Nomi] That was the farm.

1674
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:33,301
And this is the factory.

1675
02:05:40,434 --> 02:05:41,800
[beeping]

1676
02:05:46,434 --> 02:05:47,900
[Bond]
They're mass-producing it.

1677
02:05:47,934 --> 02:05:49,334
Nomi, come and look at this.

1678
02:05:49,367 --> 02:05:51,934
Well, look,
you cannot stop it, mister.

1679
02:05:51,967 --> 02:05:54,401
We have big plan, you know.

1680
02:05:54,434 --> 02:05:55,834
- We have big numbers.
- What is it?

1681
02:05:55,867 --> 02:05:57,434
[Bond] It's a simulation.

1682
02:05:57,468 --> 02:05:59,234
They're not
just attacking individuals.

1683
02:05:59,267 --> 02:06:01,201
They're going to kill millions.

1684
02:06:01,234 --> 02:06:03,767
It will not fit
in a suitcase this time, lady.

1685
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:06,000
He's really getting
on my nerves.

1686
02:06:06,034 --> 02:06:06,900
Well, shut him up.

1687
02:06:08,633 --> 02:06:11,267
[groans] Ow!

1688
02:06:11,301 --> 02:06:12,934
My nose.

1689
02:06:16,267 --> 02:06:19,334
[Bond] We have
to destroy this whole facility.

1690
02:06:19,367 --> 02:06:20,834
[Safin over speaker]
<i>There is no need for violence.</i>

1691
02:06:20,867 --> 02:06:23,167
Mr. Safin,
they use explosives.

1692
02:06:23,201 --> 02:06:25,367
- [Nomi] Shut up.
- [Safin] <i>Mr. Bond,</i>

1693
02:06:26,867 --> 02:06:30,568
<i>you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.</i>

1694
02:06:32,034 --> 02:06:34,900
<i>Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?</i>

1695
02:06:34,934 --> 02:06:36,034
<i>Like adults.</i>

1696
02:06:38,733 --> 02:06:40,367
Safin, where is he?

1697
02:06:45,967 --> 02:06:47,468
If I don't come back,

1698
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:50,234
blow it all to shit.

1699
02:06:51,234 --> 02:06:52,568
We don't have enough
explosives for that.

1700
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,534
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1701
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,434
Huh.

1702
02:07:08,934 --> 02:07:11,101
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- [birds chirping]

1703
02:07:11,967 --> 02:07:13,234
[door unlocks]

1704
02:07:13,267 --> 02:07:15,167
[man] He said you must drink.

1705
02:07:15,201 --> 02:07:17,267
- For your health.
- [Madeleine] Do you trust him?

1706
02:07:17,301 --> 02:07:20,234
He made me kill
your last master.

1707
02:07:20,267 --> 02:07:22,334
Why do you think
he let you join him?

1708
02:07:22,367 --> 02:07:25,534
I think he wants you to drink.

1709
02:07:28,201 --> 02:07:30,934
I want him to give me
my daughter back.

1710
02:07:30,967 --> 02:07:34,234
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

1711
02:07:44,733 --> 02:07:46,234
Do you know
what this flower does?

1712
02:07:52,234 --> 02:07:53,534
It makes you blind.

1713
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:57,167
Just a drop of this
in your eye,

1714
02:07:57,201 --> 02:07:58,534
and you'll never see again.

1715
02:08:01,234 --> 02:08:03,067
Losing one eye is a tragedy.

1716
02:08:03,101 --> 02:08:04,534
Losing two...

1717
02:08:04,568 --> 02:08:06,700
- No games.
- This is not a game.

1718
02:08:06,733 --> 02:08:07,934
[groans]

1719
02:08:08,867 --> 02:08:10,401

[banging on door]

1722
02:08:45,767 --> 02:08:46,600
[Safin] Welcome.

1723
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,434
On the floor.

1724
02:08:58,633 --> 02:08:59,733
Your sidearm.

1725
02:09:01,534 --> 02:09:02,367
Careful.

1726
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:10,367
- She is light as a feather.
- [Bond] All right!

1727
02:09:21,767 --> 02:09:22,733
Please, sit.

1728
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,234
[whispers]
It's going to be all right.

1729
02:09:31,267 --> 02:09:33,301
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

1730
02:09:34,301 --> 02:09:36,501
[Safin] James Bond.

1731
02:09:36,534 --> 02:09:38,867
History of violence.

1732
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,534
License to kill.

1733
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:44,101
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

1734
02:09:44,134 --> 02:09:46,101
In love with Madeleine Swann.

1735
02:09:48,201 --> 02:09:50,534
I could be speaking
to my own reflection.

1736
02:09:50,568 --> 02:09:52,501
We've made
slightly different choices.

1737
02:09:52,534 --> 02:09:56,534
No. We've just developed different
methods for the same goal.

1738
02:09:58,067 --> 02:10:01,000
Only your skills die
with your body.

1739
02:10:01,034 --> 02:10:03,534
Mine will survive
long after I'm gone.

1740
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:07,800
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1741
02:10:10,234 --> 02:10:11,101
Isn't it?

1742
02:10:12,633 --> 02:10:14,367
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1743
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,401
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

1744
02:10:18,434 --> 02:10:19,568
What do you think?

1745
02:10:22,867 --> 02:10:24,967
I think you're right.

1746
02:10:26,767 --> 02:10:27,900
Thank you.

1747
02:10:27,934 --> 02:10:29,367
[Bond] I think we are the same.

1748
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:32,167
We both know
what it feels like

1749
02:10:32,201 --> 02:10:34,600
to have everything
taken from us

1750
02:10:34,633 --> 02:10:37,401
before we're even
in the fight.

1751
02:10:37,434 --> 02:10:42,367
It would have been nice
to have a chance,

1752
02:10:42,401 --> 02:10:44,267
you know, don't you think?

1753
02:10:44,301 --> 02:10:47,501
Just...
we all should get a chance.

1754
02:10:47,534 --> 02:10:50,167
But this thing
that you're building,

1755
02:10:50,201 --> 02:10:52,367
it puts everyone,

1756
02:10:52,401 --> 02:10:54,934
the whole world
on a battlefield.

1757
02:10:54,967 --> 02:10:57,034
Nobody gets a chance.

1758
02:10:57,067 --> 02:10:58,800
[exhales sharply]

1759
02:11:00,367 --> 02:11:03,434
The thing
that no one wants to admit

1760
02:11:03,468 --> 02:11:07,667
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1761
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:11,101
We tell each other lies
about the fight for free will

1762
02:11:11,134 --> 02:11:12,568
and independence,

1763
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:16,067
but we don't really want that.

1764
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:17,767
We want to be told how to live,

1765
02:11:19,301 --> 02:11:21,301
and then die
when we are not looking.

1766
02:11:22,934 --> 02:11:25,800
People want oblivion,

1767
02:11:27,067 --> 02:11:30,434
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1768
02:11:32,568 --> 02:11:36,468
So, here I am,
their invisible god...

1769
02:11:38,468 --> 02:11:42,167
[whispers]
sneaking under their skin.

1770
02:11:42,201 --> 02:11:45,000
You know that history isn't
kind to those who play God.

1771
02:11:45,034 --> 02:11:45,967
And you don't?

1772
02:11:47,867 --> 02:11:52,934
We both eradicate people to
make the world a better place.

1773
02:11:52,967 --> 02:11:58,101
I just want to be
a little... tidier.

1774
02:11:58,134 --> 02:12:01,201
Without collateral.

1775
02:12:01,234 --> 02:12:03,568
I want the world to evolve,

1776
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:05,434
yet you want it
to stay the same.

1777
02:12:06,767 --> 02:12:07,800
Let's face it...

1778
02:12:11,267 --> 02:12:14,700
- I've made you redundant.
- [Bond] No.

1779
02:12:14,733 --> 02:12:17,034
Not as long as there are
people like you in the world.

1780
02:12:18,934 --> 02:12:22,468
And with all due respect
to the enormity of your...

1781
02:12:23,534 --> 02:12:24,900
tidy achievements,

1782
02:12:26,201 --> 02:12:29,067
all you're really doing is
standing in a very long line

1783
02:12:29,101 --> 02:12:31,267
of angry little men.

1784
02:12:31,301 --> 02:12:35,101
I'm not angry,
just passionate.

1785
02:12:36,767 --> 02:12:39,501
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1786
02:12:39,534 --> 02:12:43,201
and you can take this precious
little angel with you.

1787
02:12:44,934 --> 02:12:45,800
And Madeleine?

1788
02:12:47,867 --> 02:12:50,434
- She stays.
- You know I can't do that.

1789
02:12:51,568 --> 02:12:53,301
[sighs] That is a shame.

1790
02:12:54,867 --> 02:12:56,534
She really hoped you would.

1791
02:12:57,401 --> 02:12:59,733
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

1792
02:12:59,767 --> 02:13:02,568
No, you have her tell me that.

1793
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:06,800
What mother wouldn't sacrifice
herself for her own child?

1794
02:13:09,234 --> 02:13:10,534
Is that what happened to yours?

1795
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,434
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1796
02:13:23,434 --> 02:13:24,767
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1797
02:13:29,101 --> 02:13:30,401
I'll do whatever you want.

1798
02:13:30,434 --> 02:13:31,468
Yes, you will.

1799
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:36,534
I... I apologize.

1800
02:13:39,967 --> 02:13:41,234
I'm sorry.

1801
02:13:42,201 --> 02:13:44,034
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1802
02:13:45,401 --> 02:13:47,700
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1803
02:13:49,633 --> 02:13:51,568
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1804
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,468
No. No. No. No. No.

1805
02:13:56,101 --> 02:13:57,367
I am sorry.

1806
02:13:59,301 --> 02:14:00,534
I'm sorry.

1807
02:14:02,301 --> 02:14:03,934
[whispers]
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1808
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,067
This is power.

1809
02:14:09,101 --> 02:14:10,134
[Bond] I'm sorry.

1810
02:14:10,967 --> 02:14:13,800
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1811
02:14:20,234 --> 02:14:21,967
[guards groan]

1812
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:24,767
James!

1813
02:14:26,034 --> 02:14:28,034
- Where is she?
- [alarm blaring]

1814
02:14:31,367 --> 02:14:32,733
[guard] The first shipment
is on the dock,

1815
02:14:32,767 --> 02:14:34,733
- ready for pickup, Doctor.
- [Safin] Very good.

1816
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:37,034
[speaking French]

1817
02:14:42,367 --> 02:14:43,568

1818

1819
02:14:46,301 --> 02:14:48,100
[inhales deeply]

1820
02:14:48,134 --> 02:14:49,733
[chuckles]

1821
02:14:53,568 --> 02:14:55,367
Hmm...

1822
02:14:57,367 --> 02:14:59,534
If you don't want
my protection, then...

1823
02:15:01,201 --> 02:15:02,401
off you go.

1824
02:15:08,767 --> 02:15:10,301
[sighs]

1825
02:15:12,733 --> 02:15:15,401
Move.
Our first buyers are arriving.

1826
02:15:28,767 --> 02:15:32,000
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1827
02:15:32,034 --> 02:15:34,700
<i>Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.</i>

1828
02:15:34,733 --> 02:15:36,201
<i>Origin unknown.</i>

1829
02:15:36,234 --> 02:15:37,101
<i>Still no sign of 007.</i>

1830
02:15:39,367 --> 02:15:42,600
Come on, Bond.
Where the hell are you?

1831
02:15:42,633 --> 02:15:45,934
This is hopeless situation,
lady. Please.

1832
02:15:45,967 --> 02:15:48,534
[indistinct announcement on PA]

1833
02:15:48,568 --> 02:15:50,000
[Nomi] Bond.

1834
02:15:50,034 --> 02:15:53,033
- [alarm blaring]
- Bond.

1835
02:15:53,067 --> 02:15:55,534
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1836
02:15:55,568 --> 02:15:58,401
Look, lady,
please, please just let me go.

1837
02:15:58,434 --> 02:16:01,633
I... There was never
gonna be a way out.

1838
02:16:02,767 --> 02:16:03,834
Stop this nonsense.

1839
02:16:03,867 --> 02:16:06,167
You don't have a chance,
anyways.

1840
02:16:06,201 --> 02:16:07,767
[grunts]

1841
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:11,167
Hey. Hey, I have a good vial
for your people,

1842
02:16:11,201 --> 02:16:13,301
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

1843
02:16:23,967 --> 02:16:27,301
[indistinct announcement on PA]

1844
02:16:30,301 --> 02:16:32,834
You know,
I do not need laboratory

1845
02:16:32,867 --> 02:16:35,434
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

1846
02:16:37,367 --> 02:16:39,600
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?

1847
02:16:39,633 --> 02:16:41,401
Time to die.

1848
02:16:41,434 --> 02:16:43,733
[screams] No!

1849
02:16:43,767 --> 02:16:46,034
[screaming]

1850
02:16:53,568 --> 02:16:55,101
Move! Move!

1851
02:16:55,134 --> 02:16:57,800
[people clamoring]

1852
02:16:59,767 --> 02:17:01,334
They dropped down
to a lower level.

1853
02:17:01,367 --> 02:17:02,900
There has to be
a stairwell down.

1854
02:17:02,934 --> 02:17:03,900
[Mathilde] Mama?

1855
02:17:08,367 --> 02:17:10,367
[speaking French]

1856
02:17:12,934 --> 02:17:14,534
Mathilde. Mathilde.

1857
02:17:29,534 --> 02:17:30,934
[in English] We should go.

1858
02:17:32,667 --> 02:17:34,401
It's Q. Do you read me?

1859
02:17:35,867 --> 02:17:37,234
Come in, 007, it's Q.

1860
02:17:42,633 --> 02:17:44,534
[man on radio]
<i>Traffic. We have traffic.</i>

1861
02:17:44,568 --> 02:17:47,267
- I think we just got buzzed.
- <i>Those are two Russian MiGs.</i>

1862
02:17:47,301 --> 02:17:49,034
<i>Traffic. TCAS,
you have control.</i>

1863
02:17:49,067 --> 02:17:50,700
I understand, and I'm doing
the best that I can.

1864
02:17:50,733 --> 02:17:52,834
Just please wait.

1865
02:17:52,867 --> 02:17:55,000
[sighs] Sir, I've got the Navy,

1866
02:17:55,034 --> 02:17:56,900
the Japanese, the Russians,
all breathing down my neck,

1867
02:17:56,934 --> 02:17:59,334
demanding to know why
we've got a C-17

1868
02:17:59,367 --> 02:18:00,700
circling a disputed island.

1869
02:18:04,301 --> 02:18:05,767
Don't tell them
anything just yet.

1870
02:18:08,301 --> 02:18:12,034
- [distant gunfire]
- [men shouting]

1871
02:18:14,134 --> 02:18:16,201
[gunfire continues]

1872
02:18:19,401 --> 02:18:21,234
[guards groan]

1873
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:27,468
- [Nomi] Ah, just in time.
- [Bond] Nomi, you know...

1874
02:18:28,568 --> 02:18:31,201
Madeleine, Mathilde,
they're my, uh...

1875
02:18:31,234 --> 02:18:32,401
- Hey.
- Hi.

1876
02:18:32,434 --> 02:18:33,434
[whispers] Family?

1877
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:36,346
[Bond, distorted]
<i>Q. Q, are you there?</i>

1878
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:37,759
Yes. Bond.

1879
02:18:37,792 --> 02:18:40,169
Do we have
any Royal Naval vessels

1880
02:18:40,209 --> 02:18:43,508
- in the immediate vicinity?
- Uh, yes. Why?

1881
02:18:43,542 --> 02:18:45,842
<i>We are gonna need an immediate
strike on this location.</i>

1882
02:18:45,876 --> 02:18:47,675
<i>This whole island,</i>

1883
02:18:47,709 --> 02:18:50,687
<i>it's a manufacturing plant
for Heracles.</i>

1884
02:18:50,758 --> 02:18:52,792
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

1885
02:18:52,825 --> 02:18:54,725
Mm-mm.

1886
02:18:54,758 --> 02:18:56,859
[Q] Bond, there's something
else you should know.

1887
02:18:56,892 --> 02:19:00,059
<i>Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.</i>

1888
02:19:00,092 --> 02:19:02,526
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

1889
02:19:02,559 --> 02:19:03,825
[Q] <i>Uh, 20 minutes.</i>

1890
02:19:05,059 --> 02:19:06,625
Q, patch me through.

1891
02:19:07,792 --> 02:19:09,725
- [M] <i>007.</i>
- M.

1892
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:13,593
<i>Our operation is attracting a
lot of international attention.</i>

1893
02:19:13,625 --> 02:19:14,892
<i>We're seeing what we can do.</i>

1894
02:19:14,925 --> 02:19:15,825
[Bond] Come on.

1895
02:19:17,392 --> 02:19:18,725
Let's go. Come on.

1896
02:19:25,892 --> 02:19:28,992
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

1897
02:19:30,226 --> 02:19:31,992
I want you to have this.

1898
02:19:34,226 --> 02:19:35,226
That'll keep you warm.

1899
02:19:40,559 --> 02:19:43,126
I have to finish this. For us.

1900
02:19:44,259 --> 02:19:45,459
I know.

1901
02:19:55,593 --> 02:19:56,758
I'll just be a minute.

1902
02:20:00,126 --> 02:20:02,226
[engine starts]

1903
02:20:03,959 --> 02:20:04,925
I've got them.

1904
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:07,559
This might come in handy.

1905
02:20:08,825 --> 02:20:10,559
Thank you.

1906
02:20:29,825 --> 02:20:31,326

02:20:32,959 --> 02:20:34,925

1910

Well, don't give them any.

<i>I'm trying to save this from
escalating to all-out war.</i>

Mallory, if we don't do this,

1917
02:21:03,625 --> 02:21:04,959
there will be nothing
left to save.

- Yes, I know, I know.

1921
02:21:12,825 --> 02:21:14,559
I've got
to open the blast doors.

1922
02:21:14,593 --> 02:21:16,226
Otherwise our missiles
will bounce off it

1923
02:21:16,259 --> 02:21:18,025

1924
02:21:18,059 --> 02:21:19,459
Yes, I know, I know.

1925
02:21:21,092 --> 02:21:23,392
[Q] Find the control room.
It should be in a tower

1926
02:21:23,426 --> 02:21:25,192
just above the blast doors.

1927
02:21:25,226 --> 02:21:27,959

nine minutes from launch.

I just showed someone
your watch.

1949

Right, good.
Now, did you find the control room?

1960
02:25:45,825 --> 02:25:47,359

[M] Very hard to know
what to say,

2080
02:36:38,426 --> 02:36:42,059

And I...

2082
