Hancock County, Mississippi

6
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,795
I feel so blessed when I look out
over our land, honey.

7
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:20,895
It's so beautiful.
We are so lucky.

8
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,806
- Make me a promise, babe?
- Yeah, anything.

9
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:26,605
You'll always keep this place
in the family.

10
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:29,112
Of course.
It's our spot.

11
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:33,550
When I look out there, all I can see
is my blood and sweat and tears.

12
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:37,148
This place was huge when I got it.

13
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:40,180
- I knew what it could be, though.
- Look at it now.

14
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,488
So rich, it's perfect.

15
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:44,927
(chuckles)
Come on.

16
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:46,725
I'm gonna race you back.

17
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:50,063
- That is, if you're up to it, old man.
- Who you calling "old man"?

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,002
- I usually win.
- Not this time.

19
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,937
If I win,
you get to do stables tonight.

20
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,769
If you win, I'll do dishes.

21
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:57,797
- Deal?
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:01,835
How 'bout when I win, you do
the stables for a week, and the dishes.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,300
- You're on.
- Man: Hup!

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Race to Redemption (2016)
Also Known As: Race to Win

25
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:10,372
- (laughs)
- Whoa.

26
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:13,076
Oh...

27
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:16,086
The winner is Miss Hannah Rhodes.

28
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,054
Yeah, a few more yards,
I'd of had ya.

29
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:19,386
(laughs)

30
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:21,914
Woman on radio: All right, you two,
you proved your endurance.

31
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,017
Time to wrap it up.

32
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,721
These plates
aren't gonna empty themselves.

33
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:27,458
- Wash up. Get in here.
- All right, boss lady.

34
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,227
Give me five minutes, I'll be there.

35
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:32,395
I need the five minutes,
so I don't suggest you take 'em.

36
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:34,597
(laughs)
Well, don't be too long.

37
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,072
All right.

38
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,369
(horse huffs)

39
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,942
(groaning)

40
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,184
(music playing)

41
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,130
Woman: So what did
you guys do this morning?

42
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:13,337
Hannah: It was great.
We rode forever.

43
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,844
It was fantastic.

44
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,074
Where is your father?

45
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:22,677
He said that he wanted to feed the horses
before he had lunch himself.

46
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:25,419
Typical.

47
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,855
Honey, the horses can wait.

48
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,987
We can't.

49
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,964
Gentry!

50
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:37,695
Gentry.

51
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,929
I'll come.

52
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:51,171
Gentry:
I love you, son.

53
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:57,920
Rudy, I need you to take care of
your mom and sister for me.

54
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,786
And this place.

55
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:02,691
Don't let it go, son.
It stays with us.

56
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,718
Okay, Dad.

57
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,157
There's something
I need you to do for me.

58
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,200
Gentry?

59
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,036
Gentry, baby!

60
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,235
Baby, wake up.

61
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,938
Wake up. Wake up.
(crying)

62
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,106
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

63
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:26,446
Go get help. Go!

64
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:29,180
(sobbing)

65
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,189
Baby, wake up, please.

66
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:35,090
You can't talk about it to anybody.

67
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,593
Ever.

68
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,358
- You understand?
- I won't say a thing.

69
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:42,491
I know.

70
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,654
Woman: I think it's a bit too soon
to be packing his things, Anne.

71
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,621
I don't think you're ready,

72
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,652
and I don't think it's gonna
feel right for the kids.

73
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:51,196
(inhales sharply)
What am I supposed to do now, Susie?

74
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:54,170
Huh?
I can't afford this place.

75
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,002
I can't tend to it.

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,668
I told him we didn't
need this much land,

77
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,906
all those horses,
but he had to have it.

78
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,641
(crying)

79
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,149
Susie:
He did the best he could.

80
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:07,343
You tried to tell him.

81
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:10,046
Hey, Mom.

82
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,987
You should eat something.

83
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,851
Yeah.

84
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:24,232
That is a powerful serve
you got there, Sheriff.

85
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:26,327
You ever play professionally?

86
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,861
I've just been practicing a bit.

87
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,771
Yeah, well, it shows.

88
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:34,039
Takes a confident man to master
the delicate game of tennis.

89
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,774
Well, that's what they say.
Your serve.

90
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:42,543
Oh...

91
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:45,987
- Story of my life.
- Nah, you just pulled it.

92
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:48,753
Uh, now, no excuses.

93
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:52,194
Hey, uh, we appreciate the support
through the campaign.

94
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:54,629
Look forward to making
some positive changes for the county.

95
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,360
Sure, Sheriff, sure.

96
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,967
Building a better community
is in everybody's best interest.

97
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,337
Don't you think?

98
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,903
Speaking of positive changes,

99
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,539
my partners and I were thrilled to hear
about that jail you gonna build.

100
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,549
We definitely vote in favor of that.

101
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,949
You getting at something, Darden?

102
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:17,579
Why don't we finish this conversation
back at the house?

103
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,418
Whatever you want.

104
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,151
Follow me.

105
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,534
Hey.

106
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,935
How you holding up, banana?

107
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,371
I'm okay.

108
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,432
Yeah?

109
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,500
(Hannah grunts)
No.

110
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:42,705
But I will be.

111
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,646
I'm really worried
about my mom and Rudy,

112
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:48,948
and I'm trying really hard
not to completely fall apart myself.

113
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,481
I feel like they need me.

114
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,486
Yeah.

115
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,720
You know, Han, your mom and I,

116
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,921
we're been through
some really tough times.

117
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:02,732
And we always get through 'em.

118
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,329
I admire your strength.

119
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,362
- You need to grieve.
- I know.

120
00:09:09,406 --> 00:09:13,900
I just don't have
anything to say right now.

121
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,707
Okay.

122
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:19,147
When you're ready, I'll be waiting...

123
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,344
with some rocky road
and whipped cream.

124
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:23,785
(Hannah laughs)
I bet you will.

125
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,018
- You and that sweet tooth.
- Eh.

126
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,321
- I binge in moderation.
- (laughs)

127
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,351
A little.

128
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:34,387
Well, I gotta get going.
I got a lot of things to catch up on.

129
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,956
And happy that I paid attention
when Daddy was still alive,

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,593
or I wouldn't even know
where to start.

131
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:40,297
Can I have a hug?

132
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:43,838
Oh, baby.

133
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,666
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

134
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,678
- Gotta get going.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,942
- Yeah.
- (clicks tongue)

136
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,375
So, what's your interest
in the prison, Darden?

137
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,683
Darden: Assume you're gonna be
looking for a contractor.

138
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,122
I'd like to be on the list
of viable candidates.

139
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,888
- So, there's the catch.
- Oh, no, no catch.

140
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:06,123
More like a suggestion.

141
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,529
To our mutual benefit.

142
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,294
Listen, Darden.

143
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,362
I know all about you
and your shenanigans.

144
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,866
And I've got a pretty good idea what
this county was like before I took over.

145
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,539
I was hired to do a job, and I'm gonna
do it to the best of my ability.

146
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,174
You understand me?

147
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:29,208
Coming in loud and clear, Sheriff.
Loud and clear.

148
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:34,214
- Thanks for the tea.
- Oh, now, come on back.

149
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,158
Play another game.
Jiminy Crickets.

150
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,558
I wanna win one.

151
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,562
(birds chirping)

152
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:47,695
I took inventory last night.

153
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:50,036
We have 12 hogs,

154
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,975
42 chickens, and three cows.

155
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,739
Now, we'll keep the chickens,

156
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,509
but we're gonna sell the cows
and hogs to the slaughterhouse.

157
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,244
What do you think, Rudy?

158
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:03,619
Rudy, you work with
all the livestock.

159
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,519
I wanna know
what you think of my plan.

160
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,685
Rudy?

161
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:11,422
Talk to me.

162
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,692
Honey, say something.

163
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,221
Hannah!

164
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,697
So, what are you thinking, Doc?

165
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,435
Well, physically,
he's perfectly healthy.

166
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,340
No problems there.

167
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,004
He could speak if he chose to.

168
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,444
So, why isn't he talking?

169
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,316
Well, stress for one thing,
but in medical terms,

170
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:38,185
we refer to it as "selective mutism".

171
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:40,554
Hannah, can you give us
a moment alone, please?

172
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:49,122
Doctor:
It's simple, really.

173
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,158
I assume this is his way of dealing
with the loss of his father.

174
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:55,965
He's just shutdown... temporarily.

175
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,167
Right. Um...

176
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,301
What else can we do in the meantime?

177
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,539
I want you to reach out
to specialist in Houston,

178
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,910
try to get an appointment.

179
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,745
This is not really my expertise.

180
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:08,274
There you go.

181
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:11,287
This doctor should be able to

182
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,948
ignite his speech, I can assure you,
but it will take time and money.

183
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,629
Whatever it takes.

184
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,490
(music playing)

185
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:48,155
- (sobbing)
- Hannah: Mom?

186
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,185
It's okay.

187
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,190
It's okay.

188
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,002
(engine shuts off)

189
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,316
(insects buzzing)

190
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,036
(sighs)

191
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,782
Why are you banging on my door
at 7:00 in the morning?

192
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:51,447
- You selling something?
- No, I'm not selling anything.

193
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:53,649
But I am here on business.

194
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,420
Good morning.
My name is Gregory Darden.

195
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,226
Just what is your business,
Gregory Darden?

196
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:03,893
Your husband owes me
$150,000, ma'am.

197
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:07,426
My husband's dead, mister.

198
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,735
So, I guess we're done here.

199
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,764
I meant to say your late husband.

200
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:14,072
And, no, we are not done here.

201
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,681
I am very sorry for
your recent loss, Mrs. Rhodes.

202
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:23,914
And I do apologize
for my abrupt behavior.

203
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:27,754
In the wake of his passing,
this becomes your responsibility

204
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,658
in accordance with
the community property laws

205
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,286
of our great state.

206
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,194
Please don't do this.

207
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,755
Unfortunately, when some dies,

208
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,699
this wicked old world
just keeps spinning around.

209
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:41,898
This property was collateral
against a business loan.

210
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,335
Now it looks like
I'm gonna have to foreclose.

211
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,865
Unless you wanna pack up right now.

212
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,505
- We can call it even-steven.
- I need to call a lawyer.

213
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,674
That's an excellent idea.

214
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:56,083
Look, Mrs. Rhodes,
I'm not an unreasonable man.

215
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:59,577
I'll even hire a realtor to help you
relocate you and the kids,

216
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:03,389
but I am going to need
that money in 30 days.

217
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,855
Otherwise, you leave me no choice

218
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:09,423
but to return with the sheriff
and seize the property.

219
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,899
By force if need be.

220
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:14,827
Am I clear enough?

221
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,532
No.

222
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,201
You're not clear enough.

223
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:22,576
I can't come up with
that amount of money in 30 years.

224
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:26,477
30 days, Mrs. Rhodes.

225
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,918
You might wanna call that lawyer now.

226
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:35,288
We have 30 days to pay Darden
or we're gonna have to leave.

227
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,085
What are we gonna do?

228
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:42,690
If it weren't for Daddy, he wouldn't
have all the cash flow that he does.

229
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,262
He was right not to trust him.
What a snake.

230
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:51,902
(sighs) Well, lawyer says
there's nothing I can do.

231
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:55,810
The judgment's valid.
He's entitled to the money Daddy owed.

232
00:15:57,347 --> 00:16:00,475
What if we race Sheba
in the barrel-racing championship?

233
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:03,281
We can use the prize money
as down payment at least,

234
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,221
and we can take out a loan
on the rest.

235
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,780
Seriously?

236
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:10,315
- Hannah.
- I am serious.

237
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,920
We can get her in shape in time.
Donny can ride her.

238
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,726
She won before, she'll win again.

239
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,029
It's not a bad idea, Sue.

240
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,832
None of us have come up
with anything better.

241
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,734
Gent took great care of her,
and said she was his jackpot.

242
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:31,145
Well, I hope he was right.

243
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,554
(sighs)

244
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,667
Dad loved you so much.

245
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,499
We need you to win us
one more championship, you hear?

246
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:02,239
Just one.

247
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,076
Ain't no races left in that dud.

248
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,843
Definitely no championships.

249
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:07,816
Back for more abuse, Mr. Birch?

250
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,046
Somebody's gotta
take care of the horses.

251
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,248
And who else is gonna
do it at this rate?

252
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,190
When you're done with Molly,
I need you to take a look at Sheba.

253
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:18,422
We might be entering her
in some races.

254
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:20,225
Good luck with that.

255
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,622
(horse huffs)

256
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:40,478
Whoa.

257
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,212
Whoa, whoa.

258
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,814
There we go.

259
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,121
- Shh.
- (whickers)

260
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,251
- (neighing)
- Easy now.

261
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:56,254
- Whoa.
- Mr. Birch, I am so sorry.

262
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:02,471
She's been kinda rowdy
since Daddy left.

263
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:04,269
I don't get paid enough for this.

264
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:08,135
I'll be back when you got my money.

265
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:21,356
(engine starts)

266
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,996
(whispers)
Easy, girl. Easy.

267
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,435
Donny, I know that
if you ride her, she can win.

268
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,496
(Donny chuckles)
Han, this old girl's past her prime.

269
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,906
Besides, your father still owes me
from last time we raced.

270
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:41,206
Donny, my dad and I
didn't have secrets.

271
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:44,145
Which means I know that he shaved
all the wages off your debt.

272
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,376
You owe him ten grand at least.

273
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,441
We had an arrangement
to get that squared away.

274
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:51,249
So, technically, he still owed me
from our race time.

275
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,085
Well, that really
isn't relevant right now.

276
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,956
- Can you please just try?
- (sighs)

277
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,527
- What do I get out of the deal?
- Pride.

278
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:01,463
- (laughs)
- You can bring back the legacy

279
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:03,159
of a man who once loved you.

280
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,169
And pride for yourself
for winning with an underdog.

281
00:19:08,004 --> 00:19:11,997
I would be proud and honored
to preserve your father's legacy,

282
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,976
but I expect to be compensated.

283
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,705
I want 10% of the winnings.

284
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:17,235
- Five.
- Eight.

285
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,907
Seven.

286
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,774
7.5, you got a deal.

287
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,844
- Greedy deal at 7.25.
- (chuckles)

288
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,186
You're your father's daughter.

289
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:29,215
(music playing)

290
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,225
Whoa, whoa.

291
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,926
(grunts)
This is a waste of my time.

292
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,367
What's wrong?

293
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,667
She gets winded every 50 feet.

294
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,605
Just doesn't have the endurance.

295
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,404
She's just getting warmed up.
She hasn't been trained in a while.

296
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:55,138
She'll get it.
I know she will.

297
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,976
I know her competition
is gonna be more than just warm.

298
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:02,809
Come on. She still has it in her.
I know she does.

299
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,546
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,786
Your father was a great man.

301
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:12,317
He's gone, and that's hard, I'm sure.

302
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:14,830
But you're holding on to something
that doesn't exist anymore.

303
00:21:14,864 --> 00:21:17,424
This horse is not a winner.

304
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,935
And she's never gonna be
a winner ever again, Hannah.

305
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,167
You need to find another way
to come up with that money.

306
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:25,265
'Cause this is not gonna be
a good return on your investment.

307
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,435
I promise.

308
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,012
So, you're just quitting?

309
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:33,607
One frustrating day
and you're just done?

310
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,050
My father loved you.

311
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,578
He taught you everything you know
and he gave you your big break.

312
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:42,786
Honor his memory
and just try harder.

313
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:44,555
Donny!

314
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,559
(softly)
You're all we have.

315
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,062
Well, hello.

316
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,900
I didn't know you'd be here.

317
00:21:56,806 --> 00:22:00,367
Dr. Smith asked when the horses
last had wormer.

318
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,275
I don't know.

319
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,544
- When did the farrier come last?
- I don't know.

320
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,210
Well, what do you know?

321
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:14,154
That my husband's gone.

322
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:18,851
I can't do it without him.

323
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:24,596
- I'm all alone.
- You have me.

324
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,966
And you are stuck with me.

325
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:28,561
Whether you like it or not.

326
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,308
They need you, Anne.

327
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,302
(music playing)

328
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,346
This is it.

329
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:21,313
I wanna put the deck
out here somewhere.

330
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,416
Kinda surround the pool, you know?

331
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,897
I want an entertainment area to grilling.
I like to grill, a lot.

332
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,290
I can make some better use
of them stables.

333
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:33,802
Maybe a warehouse, boat or RV garage?

334
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:35,668
Perfect.

335
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,570
Tennis court's out there
somewhere, of course.

336
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,871
Me and the sheriff like to play.

337
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:44,107
Man, I have been waiting
to get my hands on this property.

338
00:23:44,147 --> 00:23:47,014
I am going to use this place.

339
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,712
- Maybe a nine-hole golf course.
- You think there's room?

340
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:52,415
Sure. All you gotta do is mow down
some of these fields.

341
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:56,152
Well, draw it up. More activities
the merrier, don't you think?

342
00:23:56,192 --> 00:24:00,185
What are you doing here?
Get off my property!

343
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,726
Safe to say,
I already own it, Mrs. Rhodes.

344
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,325
Just a matter of time.

345
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,495
Hey! Watch it!

346
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:10,438
These are imported-handmade.

347
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:14,102
You need to leave right now,
before I get my rifle.

348
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:18,276
There's no need for that, Mrs. Rhodes.

349
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,781
Hannah!

350
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,645
Hannah: Yeah, Mom?

351
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,521
I am putting y'all out.
All of ya.

352
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:28,956
- Get my 30/30.
- You know that, right?

353
00:24:28,992 --> 00:24:32,553
(sighs) Come on.
Let's let the chickens have their day.

354
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,935
(breathing heavily)

355
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,701
Brass is worth money.

356
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:53,045
Gotta liquidate everything we have
if we're gonna make a dent in that debt.

357
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:56,540
You're gonna need a lot more brass
if you're gonna pay back Darden.

358
00:25:00,023 --> 00:25:02,651
Um, Donny quit today.

359
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:04,683
What?

360
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:07,195
So, the race won't be an option
for us anymore.

361
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:18,837
Hannah...

362
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,399
why don't you race?

363
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:23,742
Daddy trained you.
You guys won two races.

364
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,680
- I'm not ready.
- (sighs)

365
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:27,842
I'm never racing again.

366
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:29,545
I can't without Dad.

367
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:35,190
Daddy would never want you to give up
on something you love so much.

368
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,257
- You have to do it.
- No, I don't.

369
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:42,661
Then what can I do?

370
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,562
I'm not ready.

371
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,153
Daddy...

372
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,887
we need your help.

373
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,259
Everything's falling apart,

374
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:15,628
and I don't know
how much more Mama can take.

375
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:18,099
And Rudy won't even talk to us.

376
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,262
Please, Daddy, help us.

377
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:28,471
Waste.

378
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:31,674
(horse neighs)

379
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:35,309
¶ He's thought about
¶ making amends

380
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,377
¶ But he's closed the barn door
¶ way too late

381
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,185
¶ Those folks
¶ are no longer his friends

382
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:46,119
¶ Yeah, he keeps selling out,
¶ then he tries to buy back

383
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:48,722
¶ When he wins some money
¶ at the dog track...

384
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:53,259
Four in a row, old man.
You sure you wanna keep this up?

385
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,828
I almost feel bad
taking this money from you.

386
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,671
It's a Christmas present from my wife.

387
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,308
Seriously gonna drop
your marital timepiece

388
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,818
on a game of nine-ball?

389
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:12,320
I don't have any way
to win my money back.

390
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:14,016
Okay.

391
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:16,389
Me, too.
Rack 'em, old man.

392
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,553
That won't be necessary.

393
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:23,032
Take this...

394
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,727
and take a hike.

395
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,871
- Christmas come early.
- Move. Scram.

396
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,397
Vamoose.
(chuckling)

397
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:37,071
How much he take you for?

398
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,206
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, now, come on.

399
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:42,183
What's the fun of being rich
if you can't spread the wealth around?

400
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:45,183
I don't want your money.

401
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,247
Look, I know
you haven't been paid out

402
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,623
the Rhode's place
since Gentry passed.

403
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,560
Let me help you with that.

404
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:56,988
I know those mouths back at the house
are wide open and waiting.

405
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:59,558
Like little birds.
(chuckles)

406
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:03,097
What do you think?
Let me buy you a drink.

407
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,502
All right.

408
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,533
- Just one drink.
- All right.

409
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,705
- That's the spirit.
- (knocks on table)

410
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,304
Where have you been?
I've been freaking out.

411
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:51,115
"Your father was a good man.
I raised this horse to run.

412
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:54,385
His name is Atonement.
He's my gift to you.

413
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:56,221
Race him and you will win.

414
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:00,127
I hope to visit soon.
Sincerely, your concerned friend".

415
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,963
Is this a joke?

416
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:08,470
There's no way this is real.

417
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,807
(sighs) Rudy, help me
get this horse to the barn.

418
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,207
We have to get him hydrated
before he falls over.

419
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:16,711
- Rudy: Wait.
- Rudy!

420
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:21,073
Come on, Rudy, say it.

421
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:25,716
Rudy, if you have something
to say just say it.

422
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:31,224
You should race... for Dad.

423
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:44,596
I'll do it.

424
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,505
I'll race.

425
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,076
Come on.

426
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:58,477
(music playing)

427
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,129
Everything okay?

428
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:34,275
Yep, I'm fine.

429
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,679
You're doing a great job.

430
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:41,615
You aren't ready to quit on me,
are ya?

431
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,150
You know, sometimes I feel like
I'm the adult in this relationship.

432
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,783
- What do you mean?
- (sighs)

433
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:53,852
I mean I feel like I'm the one
carrying all the weight,

434
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:56,626
and you expect me to save everyone.

435
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,964
Bail us out of this mess.

436
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,935
Pay back for Daddy's mistakes.

437
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,337
However you wanna look at it,
I can't stand the pressure, Mom.

438
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,731
Hannah.

439
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,341
It's not fair,
and I don't even think I can do it.

440
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:13,948
Hannah!

441
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:23,919
Hannah: It's gonna be hard
to leave this place.

442
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:27,156
It's like losing Dad all over again.

443
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,323
Except, I haven't even recovered
from the first time.

444
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:32,095
We're not going anywhere.

445
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,602
You have to have more faith
than that, Han.

446
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,831
We're out of time.
We're completely out of options.

447
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:39,864
We're not gonna figure it out.

448
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,271
Well, I remember when
your dad took on this ranch.

449
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,010
It was like an impossible task.

450
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,143
No one believed
that he could do it.

451
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:52,518
He had a vision.

452
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:55,581
And we take view.

453
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:57,615
You get what I'm saying?

454
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,595
Yeah. Yeah,
I get what you're saying.

455
00:34:01,564 --> 00:34:03,225
Win that race...

456
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:05,563
and honor him.

457
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,428
(music playing)

458
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:39,259
What are you so down for, baby girl?

459
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:42,733
It's just a test of your strength.

460
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:44,967
Don't let it break you.

461
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:48,336
I love you all very much.

462
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:52,142
I miss you, Daddy.

463
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,483
(cheering and applause)

464
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,620
Announcer: Up next,
we have veteran Charlie East

465
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:09,222
of Hancock County riding Blue Steel.

466
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:31,309
That's 15.3 for Charlie East
of Hancock County.

467
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,855
15.3, I can't even
come close to that.

468
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:39,725
Baby, it's just the qualifying race.

469
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,526
If it doesn't work out today,
you still have another shot.

470
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:45,796
Your daddy taught you
everything you need to know.

471
00:35:45,835 --> 00:35:48,827
He believed in you.

472
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,964
I believe in you.

473
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:52,701
You can do this.

474
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,142
Okay. Okay.
I'm ready.

475
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:59,545
Remember, if you feel him slowing down,
give him a good nudge.

476
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,413
You're in control, okay?

477
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,714
You can do this.

478
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:05,583
Okay.

479
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,145
That's my girl.

480
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:09,453
- Okay.
- Announcer: Up next, we have newcomer

481
00:36:09,492 --> 00:36:11,824
Hannah Rhodes riding Atonement.

482
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,262
It's not too late to back out, Han.
You don't have to do this.

483
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:23,635
I wanna do it, Daddy.
I wanna race.

484
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,670
Well, I've never been
more proud of you.

485
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,168
Thanks, Dad.

486
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,113
I just wish I was someone that
you could've been more proud of.

487
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:36,276
Nobody's perfect, but in my eyes,
you were as close as it gets.

488
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,718
I'm so proud to be your daughter.

489
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,357
So grown up.
When did that happen?

490
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,162
All right.

491
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,892
You go get 'em, baby girl.

492
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:53,902
- I'll be right there with you.
- (exhales sharply)

493
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:55,801
I won't let you down, old man.

494
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,864
I won't let you down either.

495
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:00,899
(cheering and applause)

496
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,501
Announcer:
That's a 14.9 from Hannah Rhodes.

497
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,904
That run qualifies her for
the 4-Friends championship next week.

498
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,000
- Congratulations, Hannah, and Atonement.
- I knew you could do it!

499
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,908
I knew you could do it.

500
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:37,776
That was amazing.

501
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:41,439
(music playing)

502
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:14,915
Uh, hi.

503
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,282
I have a delivery
for Miss Hannah Rhodes.

504
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,082
You're looking at her.

505
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:22,957
Here you go, and sign here, please.

506
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:25,357
Hold that.

507
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:30,563
- Thanks.
- Oh! My riding boots.

508
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,726
Just in time for the race.

509
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,168
Help yourself to some jerky.

510
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:36,796
Oh, sure.

511
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,900
My dad used to love jerky.

512
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:45,380
- Mm.
- Jerky can keep you going all day long,

513
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:47,746
and it's the one thing
that will never disappoint you.

514
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,047
Is that so?

515
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:52,280
Certainly never disappointed me.

516
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:56,388
What?

517
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:59,053
You seem pretty young
to be out there racing.

518
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:00,925
(laughs)
Okay.

519
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,828
Well, I've been riding since I was six.

520
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:04,992
And during the summers,
I attend a program

521
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:07,093
at an equestrian college
in West Virginia.

522
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,128
So, trust me, I have earned
my spot at that ranch.

523
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,777
Uh, well, it was nice to, uh,
have met you, Miss Hannah Rhodes.

524
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,575
(both chuckle)

525
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:21,105
- Oh, here you go.
- Oh, keep it. I'll make another batch.

526
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,983
- Wait, you made this batch?
- Yeah.

527
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,551
Maybe you could teach me
how to make it sometime.

528
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:29,682
Yeah.

529
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,590
(laughs)
I'll see you around.

530
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:45,297
Anne:
Easy, girl. Whoa.

531
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,366
- Whoa.
- Well...

532
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,344
she's in great shape.

533
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,446
She'd due any day now.

534
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,109
Anne: Any day?

535
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,015
That just darkened my week.

536
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,247
I'm not prepared
to have another mouth to feed.

537
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,258
Give her these twice a day.
It'll help.

538
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:07,658
- Thanks, Doc.
- See it as a happy time.

539
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,857
Don't let it stress you out.

540
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,228
- Yeah.
- I'll be back in a few days

541
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:14,565
to check on her.

542
00:40:14,603 --> 00:40:16,127
Probably Friday.

543
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,663
If anything happens before then,
please, call me immediately.

544
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,772
Got you on speed dial.

545
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,006
- Anne.
- Yeah.

546
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,776
I know times are tough right now.

547
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:30,148
But everything's gonna okay.

548
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,549
(music playing on radio)

549
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:57,872
Well, if it isn't "Dr. Once Was".

550
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:02,445
How are you this fine afternoon?

551
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:05,078
Not as good as
my favorite lying, cheating..

552
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,951
Hold that thought.

553
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:11,050
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Well, yes, I could use a drink.

554
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,152
- Please.
- What's on your mind?

555
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:15,288
Whiskey on the rocks.

556
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,888
Thank you.

557
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:22,696
Now, are we here
to trade loving insults,

558
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:24,763
or you got something for me?

559
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:31,041
Spend it wisely.

560
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:33,777
Don't you worry about that.

561
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:36,512
Well, I'm all ears.

562
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:39,214
Got this new colt from somewhere.

563
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:42,018
- Any idea where?
- Not really.

564
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:43,354
The girl's working him.

565
00:41:43,392 --> 00:41:45,383
Thinking about running him
in the big race.

566
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:47,861
Hannah? Why?

567
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:51,423
The other kid Don quit,
so she's training.

568
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:54,264
Colt looks pretty good
from what I can see.

569
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:58,162
- How's she look?
- (chuckles)

570
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:00,573
Like a three year old on a ten-speed.

571
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:02,577
(laughing)

572
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,841
Well, that's just perfect.

573
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,076
Here you go.

574
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,884
- Why, thank you, darling.
- You got it.

575
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:21,055
Here's to the precious three year old
on a brand-new ten-speed.

576
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:23,291
(chuckles)

577
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,425
(music playing)

578
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:55,158
Still way off,
and you're all over the place.

579
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,064
You need to push.
Atonement can take it.

580
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,694
Well, I can't!
Okay, I feel clumsy and awkward.

581
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:02,795
And I don't even think
I can control him right now.

582
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:04,305
I think you've had enough for today.

583
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:06,603
You're just getting frustrated
because you're overly tired.

584
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:08,473
You're not ready to quit
on me, are you?

585
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,740
I think I need to give it
a few more runs.

586
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:13,111
You can do this, baby.

587
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,659
You're wasting your time
on that animal.

588
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:31,962
It ain't worth five minutes.

589
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,766
If I was a gambling man, I'd say that
she wouldn't make it through winter.

590
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:37,931
What did you say?

591
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:40,498
You really should have me
put that horse down.

592
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,772
It's the humane thing to do.

593
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,972
You get off our property.

594
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:47,208
And don't you come back.

595
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,218
We can get anybody else
to take care of our livestock.

596
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,277
Good luck finding somebody
to do that for free.

597
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:03,996
Darden, you remember
you said if I did that thing for you,

598
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:05,329
you'd have something for me?

599
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:08,530
Well, I changed my mind.
I'll do it.

600
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,504
Count me in.

601
00:44:24,353 --> 00:44:26,514
Don't you listen to him.

602
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:29,353
Nobody is ever gonna put
any of our horses down.

603
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,121
You understand?
Don't you worry.

604
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:37,093
(kisses)
My sweet, strong boy.

605
00:44:41,103 --> 00:44:43,094
(music playing)

606
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:55,716
¶ Do you know my name?...

607
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,219
Gentry:
I'm real proud of you, son.

608
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:01,848
I know it wasn't easy to watch
your mom and sister go through all that,

609
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,585
but you kept your word.

610
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:08,694
Okay, Dad.

611
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,630
I love you.

612
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,860
I love you, too, bud.

613
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,564
¶ My mama's eyes

614
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:20,268
¶ My daddy's hands

615
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:23,300
¶ My grandma's heart

616
00:45:24,613 --> 00:45:28,515
¶ If you wanna see

617
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,610
¶ I'll show you more

618
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,680
¶ I'll show you things...

619
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:36,953
Gentry:
I'm real proud of you, baby girl.

620
00:45:39,828 --> 00:45:41,921
You've come a long way
in just a few days,

621
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:44,090
and I know you can do this.

622
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:46,498
¶ With a pretty voice

623
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:51,638
You're my champion.
¶ Who writes you songs

624
00:45:51,673 --> 00:45:54,870
¶ And holds you close

625
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,978
We sure appreciate you
coming by, my friend.

626
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,217
I got a feeling
things are gonna go our way.

627
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:11,225
We'll be thinking about you.

628
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:13,193
I like your bike.

629
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,786
You, um, want some jerky?

630
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:20,493
Thanks.

631
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:22,400
Come on, girly.

632
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,309
¶ And it's killing me

633
00:46:31,346 --> 00:46:34,611
¶ I wanna let you in

634
00:46:35,317 --> 00:46:38,445
¶ But I can't keep on like this...

635
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:42,287
Well, she didn't get
the riding gene from Gent.

636
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:46,624
Anne: She's just rusty.
¶ Just a girl...

637
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,289
Needs a little time
to get reacquainted.

638
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:55,393
- Keep going.
- (groans)

639
00:46:57,005 --> 00:46:59,530
This place is as good as Darden's.

640
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,674
Come on, banana!

641
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:09,039
- (chatter)
- (music playing on radio)

642
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,525
I missed that shot myself.

643
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:23,429
- The stick slipped.
- Your stick slipped?

644
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,399
That's just sad.

645
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:28,129
Pay up.

646
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,162
- You don't even need the money.
- It's not about need.

647
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:34,642
It's about earning it.
Wouldn't you agree?

648
00:47:34,676 --> 00:47:38,305
Look, this thing we're doing
is a business deal.

649
00:47:38,346 --> 00:47:39,870
Just like any other.

650
00:47:39,915 --> 00:47:43,248
But you drop so much
as a stitch anywhere,

651
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:46,186
you're gonna be out a lot more
than 20 measly bucks.

652
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,716
It's just not right, Darden.

653
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:52,090
They're good people.
They've suffered enough.

654
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:54,857
Don't let your conscience bother you.

655
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:57,160
You got your own debts to pay.

656
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,633
You want out, you pay up.

657
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,398
Pure and simple.

658
00:48:02,437 --> 00:48:04,428
We agreed?

659
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,542
I guess we are.

660
00:48:08,577 --> 00:48:10,602
I love this place.

661
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:12,772
I think I'm gonna retire here.

662
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:15,477
Later, gator.

663
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,387
- What is it?
- Deliciousness.

664
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,484
You need that for
the big race tomorrow.

665
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,655
Trust me,
it'll make a big difference.

666
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,962
- (gags)
- Mm-mm.

667
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,127
Mm, I.. I think
I'm gonna throw up.

668
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:35,864
Mm-mm.

669
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,203
You know how long it took me?

670
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,766
That's like 17 pounds of greens.

671
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,870
To take this many veggies

672
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:46,778
and make it this big.

673
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,418
There are so many vitamins in there.

674
00:48:50,452 --> 00:48:52,647
Nutrients. Electrolytes.

675
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:55,121
- We have any gum?
- Vitamin C. Potassium.

676
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:59,149
No sugar. I want your body
at optimal peak performance.

677
00:48:59,194 --> 00:49:01,253
It's gum.

678
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:03,526
And what about my mental state?

679
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,557
- I feel like I'm going crazy.
- Yeah, you look like you are, too.

680
00:49:15,143 --> 00:49:17,134
(music playing)

681
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:41,593
Susie: Right now,
we're most concerned about your speed,

682
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:45,094
- your balance, your agility..
- Okay, I get it.

683
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:48,567
Good night. I love you.

684
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,009
Come on, Rudy.

685
00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:03,785
(sighs)

686
00:50:03,825 --> 00:50:05,816
Hey...

687
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,559
I know it's hard with
that much pressure on you, okay?

688
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:13,529
But your best is gonna be enough.

689
00:50:13,568 --> 00:50:17,060
Enough for your mom
and enough for Rudy.

690
00:50:17,105 --> 00:50:19,300
- Okay?
- You really think I can do it?

691
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,175
Oh, I know you can.
That's why I'm so hard on you.

692
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,578
Remember, I only need your best.

693
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,909
Get some rest.

694
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,181
Okay.

695
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:36,147
Good night, banana.

696
00:50:46,534 --> 00:50:48,525
(music playing)

697
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,075
(sighs)

698
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:06,710
(music playing)

699
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:38,017
Announcer: Welcome to the 2015 Hancock
County Barrel-Racing Championships.

700
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:41,283
We've got over 100 competitors
here today, all racing the clock

701
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:44,314
to bring home
that first place buckle.

702
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:45,986
Announcer #2:
I'll tell you what I noticed, Steve.

703
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:48,154
This is a much tighter arena
than when I used to race.

704
00:51:48,196 --> 00:51:50,790
It's gonna be very important for
the competitors to hug the corners close

705
00:51:50,832 --> 00:51:52,459
- and get off to a fast start.
- Susie: Your best.

706
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,094
Win or lose, it doesn't matter
as long as you do your best.

707
00:51:55,136 --> 00:51:58,867
I will be so proud of you.
I'm already so proud of you.

708
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,467
I feel like I'm gonna forget
everything I need to know.

709
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:03,534
Like all of my training is just
gonna completely disappear.

710
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,773
Honey, you know what to do.

711
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:08,078
- Get out there and do it.
- Announcer: Up next, we have veteran

712
00:52:08,116 --> 00:52:10,243
Charlie East of Hancock County
riding Blue Steel.

713
00:52:10,285 --> 00:52:12,116
- Okay. Okay.
- (cheering and applause)

714
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:13,984
And veteran Charlie's out of the gate.

715
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:16,616
He's running strong.
He's making his way to the first barrel.

716
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:18,216
He goes around the first barrel.

717
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:19,851
He skipped the pocket hard.

718
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,759
He's making his way
to the second barrel.

719
00:52:21,796 --> 00:52:25,391
Ooh, he's going around the second barrel
now and he's headed toward the third.

720
00:52:27,168 --> 00:52:30,103
Gentry:
You done it, baby girl.

721
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:35,672
Announcer: He's moving 'round barrel
number two. He's coming on in fast.

722
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,804
I'm so proud of you
and your perseverance.

723
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,943
I love you, Hannah.

724
00:52:40,982 --> 00:52:42,711
What if I can't do it, Dad?

725
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,516
There will be other opportunities
out there if you wanna take 'em.

726
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:48,613
So no worries.

727
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:51,090
Get on out there.

728
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,922
Announcer:
Ooh, he's cutting the pockets hard.

729
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,394
He's making his way
to the finish line.

730
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:57,227
And it's a 14.767.

731
00:52:57,265 --> 00:52:58,527
- Where is she?
- Heck of a run for our veteran

732
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:01,034
- Charlie East.
- (Atonement whickers)

733
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:04,197
Up next, we have Hannah Rhodes
riding Atonement.

734
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,013
(cheering and applause)

735
00:53:18,086 --> 00:53:20,316
Hannah's strong out the gate.
She's looking good.

736
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,026
- Ooh, a slight stumble around barrel one.
- Dang it.

737
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:28,625
Come on, banana.

738
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,290
Announcer: Picking it up right here.
She's getting some speed.

739
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,731
She chasing. She's got around two.
Here she comes.

740
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,234
That's right!

741
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:39,004
Announcer:
Oh, knocking down barrel three

742
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,941
is gonna take Hannah
right out of today's competition.

743
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,616
(crying)

744
00:54:04,399 --> 00:54:07,300
- What happened?
- It was like we weren't connected.

745
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:10,429
I went left, he went right,
and I... I don't know what happened.

746
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,133
It was like I was riding
a different horse.

747
00:54:13,174 --> 00:54:15,005
You pick yourself up.

748
00:54:17,512 --> 00:54:19,275
Stand tall.

749
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:22,943
You did your best,
and everything is gonna be okay.

750
00:54:22,984 --> 00:54:25,578
Hannah, are you okay?

751
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,485
I'm so sorry I let you down, Mom.

752
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:29,285
No, sweetie.

753
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:31,121
Oh, you could never let me down.

754
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:34,128
I'm so proud of you.

755
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:37,154
Baby, I love you so much.

756
00:54:37,865 --> 00:54:40,231
All right, let's get going on plan B.

757
00:54:40,268 --> 00:54:42,395
We have a plan B?

758
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,432
Not yet,
but we'll think of something.

759
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,141
Anne:
Come on. Let's go.

760
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,041
(music playing on radio)

761
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,490
Oh, there you are, Jeffery.

762
00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:14,000
Nicely done, Jeffery, nicely done.

763
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:17,801
- My money.
- What money?

764
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,673
You said that if I did that thing for you,
you would give me more money.

765
00:55:22,744 --> 00:55:26,737
- Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did, and I want my money.

766
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,806
I think you misunderstood
our arrangement.

767
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,545
I said I would clear your debt.

768
00:55:30,585 --> 00:55:33,179
I never said I would
pay you for anything.

769
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,088
Hey, you better take it
down a notch, Jeffery!

770
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,684
You best tread
very lightly right now.

771
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:41,627
Otherwise, you are gonna
ruin my celebration.

772
00:55:41,663 --> 00:55:44,063
You don't wanna ruin my celebration,
do you, Jeffery?

773
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:46,896
Because that would
make me very angry.

774
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:50,529
And if I became angry, I would
have to find a place to put that anger.

775
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,061
And there you are.

776
00:55:52,106 --> 00:55:54,233
Right there in front of me.

777
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:56,573
So...

778
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,602
we done here?

779
00:56:03,317 --> 00:56:05,581
Where is that little girl?

780
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,918
I like that little girl.

781
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:13,617
(music playing)

782
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:25,103
¶ I've never been afraid

783
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:28,700
¶ Of sinking like a stone

784
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:39,377
¶ Holding on to everything

785
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,951
¶ Jumping in alone

786
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:52,221
¶ It's like I rush to the bottom

787
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:56,168
¶ Always craving the deep end

788
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,002
¶ That feeling of falling

789
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,067
¶ Yeah, that feeling of sinking

790
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:06,239
¶ I am so heavy

791
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:11,741
¶ When will I just learn to float?

792
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:26,591
Bye now, girl.

793
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:30,565
You were always his favorite.

794
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,735
It's just you and me now.

795
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,839
Hannah:
So this is plan B?

796
00:57:40,882 --> 00:57:42,747
Just leaving.

797
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:46,214
Look at the bright side.

798
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:50,190
No more maintaining
all this land, this big house.

799
00:57:50,224 --> 00:57:53,455
No more picking up poop for me.

800
00:57:53,494 --> 00:57:55,485
Exactly.

801
00:57:57,398 --> 00:58:01,596
Well, maybe we'll move
to a high-rise in the city.

802
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:06,739
- The city?
- What do you think?

803
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,004
I can't just park my horse
at a parking meter.

804
00:58:09,043 --> 00:58:10,601
Okay.

805
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,141
Maybe not the city.

806
00:58:17,218 --> 00:58:19,243
I really am sorry, Hannah.

807
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,881
I really am.

808
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:23,515
For what?

809
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:26,823
I should never have
put so much pressure on you.

810
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,954
It was never your problem to solve.

811
00:58:29,764 --> 00:58:32,961
It was wrong of me
to burden you with it all.

812
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,662
I like doing all that stuff.

813
00:58:35,703 --> 00:58:39,537
It makes me feel like
I'm filling Daddy's shoes.

814
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:42,566
Besides, Dad always told me
I was his toughest cowgirl.

815
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,070
Yeah, that sounds like Daddy.

816
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:48,172
(chuckles)

817
00:58:48,216 --> 00:58:49,945
Now pack.

818
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:53,044
We have to get this done
so we can just move on.

819
00:58:58,426 --> 00:59:00,826
Promise me one thing, Hannah.

820
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:02,022
What?

821
00:59:02,063 --> 00:59:04,395
That you just be a kid.

822
00:59:04,432 --> 00:59:07,629
You've always been so grown up.

823
00:59:07,668 --> 00:59:09,693
I want you to just focus on yourself.

824
00:59:09,737 --> 00:59:11,796
Okay?
No more training.

825
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,864
No more excessive chores.

826
00:59:13,908 --> 00:59:15,739
No parenting your brother.

827
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:19,640
Me, for that matter.

828
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:23,613
Let that be a change you make.

829
00:59:24,952 --> 00:59:27,386
- Meet some kids your own age.
- (sighs)

830
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,651
Meet a boy.

831
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,624
- (laughs)
- You need that.

832
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:34,560
I'm really okay, Mom.

833
00:59:34,595 --> 00:59:36,688
You are too much, girl.

834
00:59:38,566 --> 00:59:40,397
All right.

835
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,206
(whickering)

836
01:00:01,355 --> 01:00:03,289
Hey, girl.

837
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:06,116
Hi.

838
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:18,195
It's coming, girl.

839
01:00:26,213 --> 01:00:28,511
Mom and Rudy, hurry up.
It's coming right now.

840
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:30,176
Hurry.

841
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,851
He's got you pretty
stressed out today, huh?

842
01:00:37,658 --> 01:00:39,523
You need something a little stronger?

843
01:00:42,063 --> 01:00:43,758
Pour me something, Teddy.

844
01:00:44,198 --> 01:00:47,531
¶ Well, the whippoorwill

845
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:51,129
¶ Is a desperate bird

846
01:00:51,172 --> 01:00:54,266
¶ She steals the sunshine...

847
01:00:54,308 --> 01:00:56,003
You could've said no.

848
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:58,341
Said no to what?

849
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:01,712
Come on, Jeff.
I saw you talking to Darden.

850
01:01:01,749 --> 01:01:03,717
I heard what he talked you into.

851
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:12,285
I needed the money.

852
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:15,261
You needed money, Jeff?

853
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,163
We all need money.

854
01:01:21,235 --> 01:01:23,226
There are more honest ways
to earn a buck.

855
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:30,168
There are good people, Jeff.

856
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,907
This is your chance
to be one of 'em.

857
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,247
Do the right thing.

858
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,488
Or I will.

859
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:49,395
¶ When the highway

860
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,864
¶ Is your friend
(sighs)

861
01:01:55,436 --> 01:01:57,734
How.. how is she?

862
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:00,366
Is the baby okay?

863
01:02:00,408 --> 01:02:02,569
She's just fine.

864
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,737
It's a boy.

865
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,610
What should we name him?

866
01:02:08,649 --> 01:02:11,117
- Redemption.
- (horse huffs)

867
01:02:11,152 --> 01:02:13,552
I think that's a fine name, Hannah.

868
01:02:18,259 --> 01:02:19,954
Oh, I'll get your money.

869
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:23,225
Oh, not necessary.
On the house.

870
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:27,963
My thank you to Gent and to you
for always taking such good care of me.

871
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:29,799
Oh, thank you.

872
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:33,162
Oh, we'll miss times like these.

873
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,141
You've always been so wonderful.

874
01:02:35,176 --> 01:02:37,974
We have so many great memories
of you and these horses.

875
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:40,378
Well, we need to make sure
we get this colt on medication

876
01:02:40,414 --> 01:02:42,644
to make sure he gets a good start.

877
01:02:42,683 --> 01:02:45,208
- Use your money for that.
- Thank you.

878
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,433
This is your time now, son.

879
01:03:02,436 --> 01:03:06,930
I'm sorry you had to grow up so fast,
but I know you're gonna do well.

880
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:10,068
I need you to take care of
your mom and my baby girl.

881
01:03:11,612 --> 01:03:13,944
I love you.

882
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,176
Always.

883
01:03:23,457 --> 01:03:25,220
Hannah:
We can't keep going.

884
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:28,319
We don't have any more time.
Darden's taken everything away.

885
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:32,628
Well, our fate
hasn't been sealed yet.

886
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:35,398
Anything could happen.

887
01:03:40,508 --> 01:03:42,169
Anything.

888
01:03:43,077 --> 01:03:47,776
Well, is that a smile?

889
01:03:47,815 --> 01:03:50,215
- Maybe.
- Oh...

890
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,310
- I like smiles.
- (giggling)

891
01:04:09,036 --> 01:04:12,699
- Where's the colt?
- It's in the barn.

892
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,469
Well, let's go take a look.

893
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,149
I was thinking about making

894
01:04:32,193 --> 01:04:36,254
some of my famous
blueberry pancakes for you two.

895
01:04:36,897 --> 01:04:39,092
I mean, if.. if you want me to.

896
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:41,829
- Really?
- Yes.

897
01:04:43,537 --> 01:04:45,596
- All right.
- (giggling)

898
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:48,335
- I'm gonna go get some blueberries and...
- (engine idling, horn honks)

899
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:51,572
- Do you hear that?
- Is that Darden?

900
01:04:52,746 --> 01:04:54,941
Better not be Darden.

901
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:56,574
It didn't look like Darden.

902
01:05:14,668 --> 01:05:16,659
- Hey there.
- (horse huffs)

903
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,068
You're a beautiful boy.

904
01:05:21,108 --> 01:05:23,941
You gonna make one heck of
a racehorse someday.

905
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:26,712
Yes, you will.

906
01:05:28,649 --> 01:05:30,310
Yes, you will.

907
01:05:32,987 --> 01:05:35,285
That is one good-looking horse,
my friend.

908
01:05:38,459 --> 01:05:40,552
- Morning, ladies.
- Anne: Who might you be?

909
01:05:40,594 --> 01:05:44,052
You one of Darden's goons?
We're almost done packing.

910
01:05:44,098 --> 01:05:45,395
Darden?

911
01:05:45,432 --> 01:05:48,299
I wouldn't be caught dead in
the same room with a crook like Darden.

912
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:49,927
My name's Carter.

913
01:05:51,905 --> 01:05:53,896
Well, what are you doing here, Carter?

914
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:56,501
And how does my son
know you and I don't?

915
01:05:56,543 --> 01:05:58,374
I beg your pardon, ladies.

916
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,539
I mean you no harm.

917
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,879
I just came to check on
my colt over there.

918
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:05,612
Now, let me
tell you something, mister.

919
01:06:05,653 --> 01:06:07,553
- Carter.
- Carter.

920
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,351
We've already lost our ranch.

921
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,858
- Miss...
- Susie.

922
01:06:11,892 --> 01:06:14,725
Susie, I don't come here emptyhanded.

923
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,024
Nor am I here to collect a debt,

924
01:06:16,063 --> 01:06:19,464
like everybody else
who walks onto this property.

925
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,469
What I intend to do
is to write y'all a big ol' check,

926
01:06:22,503 --> 01:06:24,971
and in exchange,
you will relinquish to me

927
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:27,838
that fine racing specimen
in the stall over there.

928
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,638
What are you talking about?

929
01:06:29,677 --> 01:06:33,010
Gentry bred his mare to a stallion

930
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:35,743
- ..named Astounding Day.
- No way.

931
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:39,219
You mean the champion
thoroughbred Astounding Day?

932
01:06:39,253 --> 01:06:40,720
The very same.

933
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:44,315
I received an invitation
to buy the foal at birth.

934
01:06:44,358 --> 01:06:47,327
- What?
- That's right.

935
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,320
Rudy over there gave me notice,
so I'm here to claim my door prize.

936
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:53,556
I...

937
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,397
Rudy gave you notice?

938
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,309
This is a signed agreement
between Gentry and myself.

939
01:07:04,345 --> 01:07:07,508
Both our attorneys were present
during the negotiations.

940
01:07:07,548 --> 01:07:10,847
Our agreement took place
long before Gentry's death,

941
01:07:10,884 --> 01:07:14,980
and so it predates
any claim to ownership by Darden.

942
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:19,919
- Mr. Carter, are you serious?
- I'm serious, little lady.

943
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,487
Now, if y'all don't mind, I'd like to
give you a check and be on my way.

944
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:27,296
I do want my vet to come
and take a look at the colt immediately.

945
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,199
If y'all don't mind.

946
01:07:42,282 --> 01:07:45,274
This is a fabulous opportunity
for Redemption.

947
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:46,946
How much did you guys agree on?

948
01:07:46,987 --> 01:07:51,686
Well, I'm gonna shave off
his gambling debts from the price.

949
01:07:51,725 --> 01:07:56,595
After deducting those bets,
I'm gonna owe you $250,000.

950
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:59,064
What?

951
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:00,794
250,000?

952
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:02,802
Is that what you just said?

953
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:07,034
Yes, he did, and it's too late
to take it back now.

954
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,710
Sir, you just bought yourself
a racing horse.

955
01:08:21,054 --> 01:08:24,615
Um, I'll go grab your paperwork.

956
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:26,819
- We had a vet..
- We'll handle the paperwork later on.

957
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,522
Rudy, have a good one, sir.

958
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:32,930
Wait, what time does the bank close?
Is today Friday or Saturday?

959
01:08:32,966 --> 01:08:35,560
- Can we cash this check right now?
- I don't see why not.

960
01:08:35,602 --> 01:08:37,467
I think the bank's open
a few more hours.

961
01:08:37,504 --> 01:08:39,165
Oh!

962
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,267
- Oh! (screams)
- This can't be happening.

963
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:43,901
(cheering)

964
01:08:43,944 --> 01:08:46,640
Oh, my God!

965
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,671
(screaming)

966
01:09:15,075 --> 01:09:18,567
Hello, Darden.
It's a pleasure to see you.

967
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,103
Well, I'm glad to see

968
01:09:21,148 --> 01:09:23,048
you've touched base with reality.

969
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:24,573
At last.

970
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,143
Y'all packed up?
Ready to go?

971
01:09:27,187 --> 01:09:29,485
Yeah, I packed.

972
01:09:29,523 --> 01:09:32,083
We were all packed.

973
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,787
But then we unpacked.

974
01:09:34,828 --> 01:09:36,887
So...

975
01:09:38,532 --> 01:09:40,397
Why on earth would you do that?

976
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:42,493
We found a way to pay you.

977
01:09:45,038 --> 01:09:48,371
- We got your money.
- All your money.

978
01:09:48,408 --> 01:09:50,501
Plus interest.

979
01:09:50,544 --> 01:09:52,671
I assume you'll be satisfied now.

980
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,274
You know, I think it's time that
you and your fan club get going.

981
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,586
Otherwise, we'll have to forcibly
remove you from the property.

982
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,317
Get off our property, Darden.

983
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:07,885
I'll bet you this thing ain't worth
the paper it's printed on.

984
01:10:09,463 --> 01:10:11,624
Y'all think you can
play me for a fool?

985
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:14,793
(laughs) We already know
you're a fool, Darden.

986
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,735
But the check is good.

987
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:19,068
Call the bank.
They're open till four.

988
01:10:19,106 --> 01:10:21,404
Call the bank?
Call the bank.

989
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,466
I'm gonna call the police.
That's who I'm gonna call.

990
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:27,139
I am serious.
You all need to think about this.

991
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,910
Looks like somebody
already made that call.

992
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,941
(laughing)

993
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:36,021
You all called the police on me?

994
01:10:45,165 --> 01:10:47,065
Afternoon, Sheriff.

995
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,065
Can I get you anything?
Iced tea? Lemonade?

996
01:10:50,103 --> 01:10:52,264
No, thank you, Susie.

997
01:10:52,306 --> 01:10:55,207
And don't worry,
I'm not here for you this time.

998
01:10:55,242 --> 01:10:58,439
Darden, I'm here for you.

999
01:10:58,478 --> 01:11:01,038
(sighs)
I need you to come with me.

1000
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,413
I need to have a little chat with you
down at the station.

1001
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:06,248
John, what's this all about?

1002
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:09,819
Your buddy Jeffery
told us everything.

1003
01:11:09,856 --> 01:11:11,915
I got a warrant for your arrest.

1004
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:15,122
I don't want this to be too formal,
so if you just get in the car,

1005
01:11:15,162 --> 01:11:17,960
- ..we can make this nice and simple.
- Let me see that warrant.

1006
01:11:17,998 --> 01:11:19,556
Give me that warrant.
Give me that warrant.

1007
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:32,643
I'm gonna need to talk to my lawyer.

1008
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:34,271
Yeah, well,
you can talk to him downtown.

1009
01:11:34,314 --> 01:11:36,839
Get your hands off me!
I put you in office, you moron!

1010
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:39,852
- I own you!
- Back down, Darden.

1011
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:42,354
Don't make me do this
in front of all these nice people.

1012
01:11:42,389 --> 01:11:46,325
This is 100,000 volts,
and it will rectify your noncompliance.

1013
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,321
All right. All right.

1014
01:11:50,364 --> 01:11:52,798
We'll talk down at the station.

1015
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:11,177
You said you wanted to
get in on the prison.

1016
01:12:11,218 --> 01:12:13,618
Well, here's your chance
to get a firsthand look at it.

1017
01:12:18,358 --> 01:12:20,849
Well, that was a nice surprise.
What did he do? What happened?

1018
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:24,421
Your girl here lost her race
because he drugged her horse.

1019
01:12:24,464 --> 01:12:25,795
He drugged my horse?

1020
01:12:25,832 --> 01:12:28,596
He bet against her and stood to win
thousands off her loss.

1021
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,193
It was a scheme.

1022
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:32,535
I'm sorry.
It's the ugly truth.

1023
01:12:34,074 --> 01:12:35,564
I told you, Aunt Susie.

1024
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:37,372
I felt like I was driving
a different horse.

1025
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:40,005
We're lucky all he did
was kick down a barrel.

1026
01:12:40,047 --> 01:12:42,072
It could've been much worse.

1027
01:12:43,684 --> 01:12:45,242
I'll be taking that.

1028
01:12:45,285 --> 01:12:48,049
You won't be making it to the bank
by four anyways.

1029
01:12:49,256 --> 01:12:50,951
He won't be needing that
where he's going.

1030
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,959
He'll have all of his needs
taken care of for quite some time.

1031
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,085
You can be sure of that.

1032
01:12:54,127 --> 01:12:57,460
So... no high-rise?

1033
01:12:58,298 --> 01:13:01,028
Nope, no high-rise.
You okay with that?

1034
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:03,366
Oh, I am so much more
than okay with that.

1035
01:13:03,403 --> 01:13:05,598
(laughs)

1036
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:11,010
Hey, you're the delivery guy.

1037
01:13:11,044 --> 01:13:13,512
The one who gave me my boots.
That's my beef jerky.

1038
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:15,742
Yep.
Also reserve deputy sheriff.

1039
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:19,218
Somebody's gotta deliver the mail just
like somebody's gotta protect this county.

1040
01:13:19,252 --> 01:13:22,380
- Guess I'm the guy for both jobs.
- Guess so.

1041
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:25,118
By the way, you got me hooked.
There's nothing like homemade beef jerky.

1042
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:27,422
(laughs)

1043
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,486
When are you gonna show me
how to make some?

1044
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:30,826
I don't even know you.

1045
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:33,196
Can't just share my deepest,
darkest secret, can I?

1046
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:36,226
Well, maybe we should
get to know each other.

1047
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:39,965
- Yeah.
- I get off work a little later.

1048
01:13:40,006 --> 01:13:42,736
I could swing by..
I mean, if that's okay with you.

1049
01:13:42,776 --> 01:13:45,574
- That's just fine with her.
- Mom.

1050
01:13:45,612 --> 01:13:49,309
Please do come by.
I'm making my famous blackberry cobbler.

1051
01:13:49,349 --> 01:13:51,613
- We'd love to have you.
- Mom.

1052
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:54,017
I will be here.

1053
01:13:56,089 --> 01:13:58,489
- Bye.
- Toot-a-loo, Ron.

1054
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:00,015
- (laughs)
- Mm.

1055
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,223
So what's next, Rudy? Hmm?

1056
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:05,663
You know, I kinda like the idea

1057
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:07,792
of breeding and selling horses.

1058
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:11,397
You make quite the sales boy.

1059
01:14:13,573 --> 01:14:15,700
And I got a lot of
really good names for 'em, too.

1060
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,435
Like, uh, Misty.

1061
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:21,777
Or Shadow.

1062
01:14:21,815 --> 01:14:23,806
Or Charming.

1063
01:14:24,718 --> 01:14:26,379
Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity.

1064
01:14:26,419 --> 01:14:28,046
(both laugh)

1065
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,612
Hey, I love you.

1066
01:14:29,656 --> 01:14:31,351
I love you so much.

1067
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,655
And I am so happy
that you're back with us.

1068
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:39,757
Let's get going.

1069
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,930
(music playing)

1070
01:15:07,727 --> 01:15:09,422
Hey, pretty lady.

1071
01:15:11,832 --> 01:15:14,858
I'm sorry about
all the trouble I caused.

1072
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:17,836
I wanna thank you.

1073
01:15:18,872 --> 01:15:20,669
For saving this place.

1074
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:24,199
Thank you for what you've done
for our baby girl.

1075
01:15:24,845 --> 01:15:27,143
You gave her her confidence back.

1076
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,149
And she might not have won
this time out,

1077
01:15:30,183 --> 01:15:32,549
but she'll be ready
for the next time.

1078
01:15:33,887 --> 01:15:35,912
It's all coming together.

1079
01:15:36,656 --> 01:15:38,590
Y'all just keep moving.

1080
01:15:39,559 --> 01:15:41,891
We will.

1081
01:15:41,928 --> 01:15:43,919
They miss you.

1082
01:15:46,032 --> 01:15:48,091
I miss you.

1083
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,945
(laughter)

1084
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:03,745
What, you too old
to let your Aunt Sue feed ya?

1085
01:16:03,783 --> 01:16:06,308
Yes, he is.

1086
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,584
- I'm gonna get you.
- Stop embarrassing him.

1087
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,552
Well, everyone,
it has been a heck of a year,

1088
01:16:12,592 --> 01:16:13,957
but we made it through.

1089
01:16:13,994 --> 01:16:16,861
So glad that y'all could join us here
for his birthday.

1090
01:16:16,897 --> 01:16:19,457
I love everyone
at this table so much.

1091
01:16:19,499 --> 01:16:21,228
Happy birthday, Rudy.

1092
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:24,131
Susie:
Happy birthday.

1093
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:29,598
- Anne: Oh, my gosh.
- (laughing)

1094
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:46,584
I love you all very much.

1095
01:16:47,127 --> 01:16:50,528
I'm real proud of who you are
and who I see you becoming.

1096
01:16:51,765 --> 01:16:53,824
Can't wait to ride with you again, Han.

1097
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:57,098
One of my favorite things
in the world to do.

1098
01:16:57,137 --> 01:16:59,332
I'm excited to ride again
with you, too, Dad.

1099
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,809
I love you, honey.

1100
01:17:04,844 --> 01:17:07,005
I love you more. Always.

1101
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:10,974
I'm always here.

1102
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:13,178
Always.

1103
01:17:17,857 --> 01:17:19,848

Race to Redemption (2016)
Also Known As: Race to Win

1105
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:12,221
(music playing)

1106
01:20:14,934 --> 01:20:18,597
¶ I am leaving on a journey today

1107
01:20:19,806 --> 01:20:24,266
¶ Packing up this soul
¶ and this skin

1108
01:20:26,913 --> 01:20:30,872
¶ There are things
¶ I've been meaning to change

1109
01:20:31,985 --> 01:20:37,617
¶ I don't think I can without going

1110
01:20:43,363 --> 01:20:48,665
¶ And I will climb, climb, climb
¶ the highest hill

1111
01:20:49,536 --> 01:20:53,632
¶ Till I'm face to face with the sun

1112
01:20:54,507 --> 01:20:57,476
¶ My eyes will see

1113
01:20:58,244 --> 01:21:02,112
¶ Their burning reflection

1114
01:21:07,687 --> 01:21:10,485
¶ I'm coming undone

1115
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:22,225
¶ Leave a trail of sorrow
¶ and shame

1116
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:27,436
¶ And all of the hurts I've held onto

1117
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:34,303
¶ They are much too heavy
¶ a weight

1118
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:41,010
¶ To take all the places I want to

1119
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:50,622
¶ And I will climb, climb, climb
¶ the highest hill

1120
01:21:50,663 --> 01:21:55,498
¶ Till I'm face to face with the sun

1121
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:59,437
¶ My eyes will see

1122
01:21:59,472 --> 01:22:03,602
¶ Their burning reflection

1123
01:22:05,912 --> 01:22:07,880
¶ Oh

1124
01:22:08,815 --> 01:22:12,012
¶ I'm coming undone
