1
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,303
I'm not going to biteyou.

2
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:45,505
I'm sorry, sir.
You gave me a fright.

3
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,639
You're up very early.

4
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:52,277
I'm generally up by 5:00, sir.
Otherwise I get behind.

5
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:02,353
I used to be able to stay up all night
and suffer no ill effects whatsoever.

6
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,326
Oh, well.

7
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:09,336
Those scars.

8
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,740
Would you mind
ifI examine them?

9
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,207
It's a purely
professional curiosity.

10
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:19,042
I don't really like to talk about them,
sir, ifit's all the same toyou.

11
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,946
There are some
on your neck as well.

12
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,541
They look almost
like teeth marks.

13
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:28,522
Yes, sir,
that's what they are.

14
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,500
Mary, you'll find an eel
in the fish pantry.

15
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,833
Fetch it in for me,
will you?

16
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:54,356
It's alive!

17
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:57,329
Warmth ofyour hands,
that'll be, revived him.

18
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,423
Put him here.

19
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,025
Difficult buggers
to kill, is eels.

20
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,094
Now, keep hold ofits tail.

21
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:07,937
Go on. Don't be soft.

22
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,081
Fetch the skinners.

23
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:37,270
- What's the matterwith you?
- I'm all right.

24
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,932
- You're as white as a sheet.
- Sorry.

25
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:43,875
Well, fetch us that
big saucepan offthe range.

26
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,566
What's he do out there
on his own all those hours?

27
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,131
He's after something.
I don't know.

28
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,701
Lastyear he used to give weekly
lectures in that operating theater.

29
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,714
He had patients,
like a regular doctor.

30
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,377
- And hejust stopped?
-Just like that.

31
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,852
From one day to the next.

32
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,651
Perhaps he's looking
for a cure for something.

33
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,524
Yes. Forwhat ails him,
ifhe's got any sense.

34
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:46,400
Shall I leave the candle a while,
or doyou want to sleep?

35
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,402
I always want to sleep.

36
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:55,304
I can't understand why it takes
so much effort to look after one man.

37
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,344
I don't mind hard work.

38
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,038
I do.

39
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:03,709
I've been in service since I was 1 2,
and this is the best place I've had.

40
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:06,912
He's a kind man, the doctor.
Anyone can see that.

41
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:10,388
Ifhe was that kind,
he'd let me sleep until 6:00.

42
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,826
Good night, then.

43
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,594
I feel safe here, is all.

44
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,300
Good morning, sir.

45
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,046
Mary, this is most welcome.
I'm ravenous.

46
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:15,547
I'm pleased, sir.

47
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:18,414
- I wasn't sure I should wakeyou.
- Why?

48
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:22,421
You can't have had much sleep, sir.
I heard you come in not three hours ago.

49
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,690
Last night I came to the end
ofa very longjourney.

50
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:34,325
For months now
I have been engaged...

51
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,733
in the driest kind ofstudy.

52
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:41,503
But last night
all the barriers fell before me.

53
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:44,836
I have made a great breakthrough.

54
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:49,581
I'm very happy to hear it, sir.

55
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:54,378
Yesterday as I was passing,
I looked into the library...

56
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:56,389
and thereyou were
with your nose in a book.

57
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,530
I had no idea
you were able to read.

58
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,533
I'm very sorry, sir.

59
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,162
You are most welcome to borrow
any book ofmine that takes your fancy.

60
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:15,299
No. I wouldn't want the other servants
to think I was getting above myself.

61
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,877
No. I can't eat any ofthis.

62
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,385
-I'll ask Mrs. Kent to coddle some eggs.
-No, that's all right.

63
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:31,021
Areyou quite sureyou don't want
to tell me howyou got those scars?

64
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,563
I'm sorry. I won't askyou again.
Leave the tray.

65
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,395
Would you ask Poole...

66
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,095
to organize the removal ofthat
to my cabinet?

67
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,432
Yes, sir.

68
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:49,672
I hopeyou haven't been making
a nuisance ofyourself, Mary.

69
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:52,678
No, sir. The doctor
wasjust telling me...

70
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:56,011
he wants his mirror
moved to his cabinet.

71
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,180
Can you account
forwhy the master...

72
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,886
chose to issue these
instructions through you?

73
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,123
No, sir. Except I told him
I'd heard him coming in late last night.

74
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:11,960
You did what?

75
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:18,835
You were in the master's bedroom
some considerable time.

76
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:20,897
What else did he say toyou?

77
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,834
We talked about doing something
with the garden.

78
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:26,379
The garden?

79
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:29,939
It's gloomy out there.
I thought we could plant a flower bed.

80
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,609
Who's going to do all this?

81
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,711
I would. I don't mind.

82
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:36,619
Aren't we finding
enough work foryou?

83
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,716
I could do it
on my afternoons off.

84
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,317
My last place in the country--

85
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:44,558
We're familiarwith your
reminiscences, Mrs. Kent.

86
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:49,295
The master used to send for one
ofthe housemaids every morning, 9:00...

87
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,770
regular as clockwork.

88
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,205
In the end,
she fell in the familyway...

89
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:56,834
and was dismissed
without a reference.

90
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,504
I often wonder
what become ofher.

91
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,641
I expect now she entertains gentlemen
all hours ofthe day.

92
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,345
- Bradshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Poole?

93
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,854
Saveyour breath
to cool your porridge.

94
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,856
Yes, Mr. Poole.

95
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,028
What areyou doing?

96
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,326
Mr. Poole doesn't allow me
in the theater, sir.

97
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,163
- Does he not?
- Mirror's in place, sir.

98
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,896
Thankyou.

99
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,531
Mary tells us you've been holding
a discussion with her about the garden.

100
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:33,776
Remind me what conclusion
we arrived at, Mary.

101
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,580
Flower beds there...

102
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:44,215
and at the corners...

103
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,055
and a herb garden
here by the kitchen.

104
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,719
The very thing.

105
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,730
Just what we need.

106
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:56,367
Oh, Poole, would you gather the staff
in the dining room at about 6:00?

107
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,871
- I have an announcement to make.
- Sir.

108
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,969
As I'm sureyou're all aware...

109
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:09,413
the pressure ofmywork has
increased considerably oflate.

110
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:13,544
Consequently, I have decided
to take on an assistant.

111
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,248
His name is Mr. Edward Hyde...

112
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:19,486
and I intend to give him
the run ofthe house.

113
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,960
Ofcourse, as a rule,
he will come and go...

114
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,963
by the side door
ofmy laboratory.

115
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:27,330
But when he does have
the occasion to step over here...

116
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:31,303
I trustyou will treat him with the same
respect thatyou've always shown me.

117
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,633
You may rely on it.

118
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:35,607
Will the gentleman
be taking his meals here, sir?

119
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,440
Not as a rule, no.

120
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:41,481
There really is
no cause for concern.

121
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:44,608
He is a quite remarkable
young man.

122
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,521
He's a solitary one,
isn't he, the doctor?

123
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:53,219
Ayear or two back
he used to have dinner parties.

124
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,488
- Then hejust stopped.
- Shame.

125
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:58,588
Oh, no.
Best thing ever happened.

126
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,257
Think ofthe washing up.

127
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,794
And he's never had any sort of...
a lady friend?

128
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:07,136
Never a woman stepped
in the front door.

129
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,437
Not since I've been here.

130
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:14,908
- Strange.
- Bradshaw says he goes to houses.

131
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,415
What?

132
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,948
Bradshaw says
he goes to houses.

133
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,355
What doyou mean?

134
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:27,359
You know.

135
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:28,860
Houses.

136
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,862
I can't believe that.

137
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:40,036
You best get offifyou're going.
I'll finish up here.

138
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,540
Thanks.

139
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,528
Sir?

140
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:05,730
Yes?

141
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,766
It was very good ofyou, sir,
to back me up about the garden.

142
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,830
Yes, I think I did ratherwell.

143
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,007
Mr. Poole questioned me
so closely about...

144
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,480
why I was so long
with you this morning.

145
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,848
It was the only excuse
I could think of.

146
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,511
So, thankyou.

147
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:32,048
Areyou sure he's not out on the landing
right now, the virtuous Poole?

148
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:36,488
No, sir.
He's gone to bed.

149
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,094
I thought, ifyou would like
to examine these scars--

150
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,698
Come here.

151
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,243
Raiseyour sleeve.

152
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,907
These go very deep.

153
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:58,243
Did they never affect
the use ofyour fingers?

154
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:03,415
I couldn't move my thumb for a while,
but it gradually came back to working.

155
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,685
Does it still
causeyou any pain?

156
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:11,424
Gives me a bit ofgyp when the weather's
damp. Otherwise it's right as rain.

157
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,058
What did this?

158
00:18:24,077 --> 00:18:25,009
Come.

159
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,441
Sit down.

160
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,277
- No, sir.
- I insist.

161
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,079
- Something to drink, perhaps?
- No, sir.

162
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,652
So, how did it happen?

163
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:44,162
It was a punishment, sir.

164
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:51,961
You done that on purpose,
didn'tyou?

165
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,030
No, sir.

166
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:58,973
What doyou think?
I'm made ofmoney?

167
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:01,674
You careless little bitch.

168
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:38,851
I'm going out now, Mary,
to see what I can find.

169
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,149
He was gone some time.

170
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,821
He had a strange way ofwalking,
not exactly a limp.

171
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,962
Buthis footsteps--

172
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,862
Well, Ialways
knewit washim.

173
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,567
It was like...

174
00:19:57,637 --> 00:20:01,232
everystep was calling myname.

175
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,806
Areyou still there, Mary?

176
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:10,611
I found you something
to keepyou company.

177
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:14,911
We wouldn't wantyou
getting lonely now, would we?

178
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,422
Was it a rat?

179
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,554
Yes, sir.

180
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,303
He knew the way
I felt about them.

181
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:40,638
HeknewIcouldn'tabide
even theidea ofthem.

182
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:46,641
And he knew,
sooner or later, it was--

183
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,450
Going to bite its way through.

184
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:54,318
Bite its way through.

185
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:58,159
Where was your mother
all this time?

186
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,263
She was working.

187
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:03,598
Shenevergothome tilllate.

188
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,616
She tookmeaway
that verynight...

189
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:20,152
triedto decide
what to do forthebest...

190
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,247
and thought I'd be safest
ifshe put me into service.

191
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,383
What happened to him?

192
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:30,392
I never seen him again
from that day to this.

193
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,672
It is a terrible story, Mary.

194
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:49,806
I can see whyyou were
so reluctant to tell it to me.

195
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,010
Thankyou for...

196
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:54,178
being so candid.

197
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,188
I shan't forget it.

198
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,226
I must go to my laboratory.
There's something I need to do.

199
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,896
You're up early
this morning, sir.

200
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,531
As a matter offact, I didn't
go to bed at all last night.

201
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:51,668
- You've been out, by seeing your shoes.
- Yes. I needed some fresh air.

202
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,815
I was thinking a great deal about
the storyyou told me last night.

203
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:59,283
You must have really
hated your father.

204
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:02,347
I don't know, sir.

205
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,356
Surely he was a monster.

206
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:10,121
When I was little and he was in work,
he wasn't so bad then.

207
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:11,891
It was the drinking
that did it.

208
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,899
You think
it was only the drink?

209
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:17,060
The drink turned him
into a different man.

210
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,729
A different man?

211
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:21,364
He even looked different.

212
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,534
What doyou mean?

213
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,137
It was like he carried
another person inside him...

214
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:29,306
and the drinking
brought him out.

215
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,817
Or maybe set him free.

216
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,622
I'd likeyou to do something for me
in strictest confidence.

217
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:42,787
I wantyou to deliver
this letter.

218
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,454
I expectyou know
where that is.

219
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:47,591
There'll be no reply
other than a yes or a no.

220
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,101
- Very good, sir.
- You'll do it then?

221
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,400
Ifyou want me to, sir.

222
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,167
Thankyou, Mary.

223
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,913
Haven'tyou everwished for
a completely new life, Mary?

224
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,508
No, sir.
What good would that do?

225
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:08,782
Supposeyou were able to do
absolutelywhateveryou wanted...

226
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:11,346
with no consequences
and no regrets.

227
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:12,857
Then what?

228
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:17,829
I don't believe there is such a thing
as actions without consequences.

229
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:59,171
Strictly speaking,
I've no vacancies at the moment.

230
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,208
We might be able to come
to some particular arrangement.

231
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,045
- Areyou Mrs. Farraday?
- Who wants to know?

232
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:09,479
I have a letter
from Dr.Jekyll.

233
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,676
- HarryJekyll, eh?
- Areyou--

234
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:15,243
Yes, I'm Farraday.
Keepyourwool on. Come inside.

235
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:28,659
Dear old Harry.
Ever the good Samaritan.

236
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:52,586
Not required in
the House ofCommons, Sir Danvers?

237
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:55,924
I imagine they can rub along
without me this once, Mrs. Farraday.

238
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:58,589
And vice versa,
I shouldn't wonder.

239
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:02,101
Sir Danvers is one ofour most
prominent spokesmen on foreign affairs.

240
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:05,604
- Aren'tyou, Sir Danvers?
- You're too kind, Mrs. Farraday.

241
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:08,402
Got any questions
on any sort ofexotic customs...

242
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:10,807
Sir Danvers is your man.

243
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:15,003
Well, perhaps
I've been a bit hasty.

244
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:18,676
No, no. She's not even
an apprentice. Notyet.

245
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,480
Oh, pity.

246
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:25,256
- Mary!
- Yes?

247
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:32,493
I look forward to meeting you
in due course.

248
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:35,466
You rub along for as long
as you like, Sir Danvers.

249
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:38,026
Or as long as you can manage.

250
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:44,909
I'll say this for HarryJekyll:
He may ask for a few special services...

251
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,105
but he doesn't mind
paying top whack.

252
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,410
So I'm to say
your answer is yes?

253
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,848
My answer's always yes.

254
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:54,250
I have my obligations, tell him.

255
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,255
It'll take me a week to clear out
the present tenant, then anotherweek...

256
00:26:57,323 --> 00:27:00,850
to make these alterations
he's asking for.

257
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:03,395
Then his assistant
can move in.

258
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,732
Can't say I've ever noticed him
in need ofany assistant.

259
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,434
Well?

260
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:26,016
She said yes, but she said
she needs two weeks to get it ready.

261
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:28,713
Hard on myyoung man.

262
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:31,120
No hardship to stay away
from that place.

263
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:36,390
He's robust enough, and he needs to live
within easy reach ofthe hospital.

264
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:41,028
- Where is he living at the moment?
- Why doyou ask?

265
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:44,202
No one in the house
has seen him.

266
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,036
He comes and goes during the night.
Now I think that will be all.

267
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:55,200
- I've seen him!
- Yes, hejust crossed the bridge.

268
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,005
But I couldn't really
make him out.

269
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,375
What was he like?

270
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:02,573
He moves funny.

271
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:06,113
Not so much a limp.

272
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:08,278
More ofa shuffle.

273
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:11,790
And he's sort ofstooped.

274
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:14,486
- Did you see his face?
- No.

275
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:16,856
Just his eyes.

276
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,625
He came outofthe dark...

277
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,633
likehe wasmade ofit.

278
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:28,366
- What's this, the mother's meeting?
- No, Mr. Poole.

279
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,071
Come here.

280
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,776
Closer.

281
00:30:15,888 --> 00:30:17,150
Closer.

282
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:35,638
What am I going to do with you?

283
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,295
You should have no trouble
cashing this.

284
00:36:30,496 --> 00:36:33,693
I thinkwe've had enough
excitement for one evening.

285
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:41,533
Close the door behind you.

286
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,269
My lord, sir,
what haveyou done?

287
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:56,610
- It's all right.
- Is it broken?

288
00:37:56,682 --> 00:38:00,846
No, it's only a sprain.
I shall need helping into the house.

289
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,047
Shall I fetch
your assistant?

290
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:09,353
What? I'm sor--

291
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:11,362
What did you say?

292
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:15,123
I thought I heard him...

293
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,669
moving around
the house last night.

294
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:22,670
Ifhe were there, doyou suppose he'd
leave me to crawl out here on my own?

295
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,469
I'm sorry, sir.

296
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:31,678
Ifyou'll allow me
to lean on you...

297
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,514
I'm sure the thing
can be accomplished.

298
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:42,092
You've been working too hard, sir.
I'm not surprised you had an accident.

299
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,152
- What's going on?
- The master's had an accident.

300
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,697
Why didn'tyou come for me?

301
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:49,200
Hold your tongue. Go upstairs
and light the bedroom fire. Bradshaw.

302
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:59,067
I was out late last night.
I must have...

303
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:01,635
somehow put myweight on it.

304
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,369
Dr.Jekyll is all too
benevolent an employer.

305
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:37,972
So it falls to me
to draw attention to occasions...

306
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,542
when I feel members ofthe household
are failing in their duties.

307
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,516
It is also my task,
may I remind you...

308
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,890
to dismiss those staffwho
persistently overstep the mark.

309
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:51,587
Yes, sir.

310
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:55,293
Haveyou any idea
to what I may be referring?

311
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,562
It was not my place
to advise the master not to work.

312
00:39:57,636 --> 00:40:00,002
Quite so. Now help me on
with my Ulster.

313
00:40:00,072 --> 00:40:03,508
The master requires certain
supplies from the chemist.

314
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:06,635
Naturally, we're all concerned
when Dr.Jekyll is unwell.

315
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,380
We are hardly likely
to improve his condition...

316
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,747
by drawing attention to our own
entirely insignificant opinions.

317
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:16,820
You must be aware there are
a great manyyoung women...

318
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:19,687
in straitened circumstances
who could fill your position...

319
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:23,319
and observe a few
elementary regulations.

320
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:25,090
Remember that.

321
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,987
- Mary.
- Yes, sir?

322
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:57,294
When we had our talk, you refused
to sayyou hated your father.

323
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:00,231
I don't.

324
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,028
Why not?

325
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:07,002
He put a dark place in me,
and I can't forgive him for that.

326
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,031
But it's part ofme now,
and how can I regret what I am?

327
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,602
Though it often makes me sad.

328
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:19,941
Oh, well, sadness, yes.

329
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,782
That can't be helped.

330
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,880
That comes in like the tide.

331
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:32,663
I knowyou're afraid ofrats.
You told me.

332
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:35,165
But what else
areyou afraid of?

333
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,460
I don't know, sir.

334
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,130
Bad dreams.

335
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:46,205
- I see.
- Confined spaces.

336
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:48,246
Yes, ofcourse.

337
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:51,544
But whatyou're saying is,
you're never afraid ofyourself.

338
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:54,218
I didn't say that.

339
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:56,754
You are afraid ofyourself?

340
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,250
Yes.

341
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,368
I thought so.

342
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,906
God, Mary.

343
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:25,040
I'm so cold.

344
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:27,711
My hands are frozen through.

345
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:43,126
Take some broth, sir.

346
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:51,436
I don't know, Mary.

347
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,741
Why is ityou strike me
as you do?

348
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,411
Get some warmth intoyou, sir.

349
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:02,212
I'm very tired.

350
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:54,129
Will you get dressed? There's something
I need you urgently to do for me.

351
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:56,140
What's all this about?

352
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:00,235
How should I know? You'll have to do
the blackleading for me this morning.

353
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:07,779
I'm afraid this won't be
a very pleasant errand.

354
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:10,955
- Is it to Mrs. Farraday?
- It is.

355
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,617
And I can't tell you
how important it may be.

356
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:38,672
Come in here!

357
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:44,380
He won't slip out ofthis one
with a few quid and a smarmy letter.

358
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:46,549
All the same,
you'd better read it.

359
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,161
He ought to have the courage
to come here hisself...

360
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,671
and clean up after
that mad dog ofhis.

361
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,230
- He said there might be a reply.
- And so there might.

362
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:04,900
Come with me.

363
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:09,010
In you go.

364
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,916
Don't even ask.

365
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,599
What shall I tell him?

366
00:45:29,668 --> 00:45:32,728
Tell him no need to panic.
I'll do anything he wants.

367
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:38,007
And you take this home
with you to HarryJekyll.

368
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:44,641
What am I supposed--

369
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:49,646
Ah, yes, it takes all sorts.

370
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:52,557
You tell HarryJekyll
this is such linen...

371
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,787
as even his old friend Mrs. Farraday
can't clean for him!

372
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:06,697
You've taken your time. The master's
waiting foryou, in the laboratory.

373
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:08,706
Go there directly.
The rule is relaxed.

374
00:46:08,774 --> 00:46:10,708
And shiftyourself!.

375
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,823
What did she say?

376
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:31,829
She said she'll do
everything you want her to.

377
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:39,197
But she said this is such linen
as even she cannot clean.

378
00:46:42,574 --> 00:46:45,475
She has always been prone
to exaggeration.

379
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:48,536
I saw the room.
There was blood on the ceiling.

380
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,147
And did Mrs. Farraday explain?

381
00:46:54,886 --> 00:46:58,617
No, sir. But I felt sure someone
had been torn to death in that room.

382
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,123
No.

383
00:47:03,962 --> 00:47:06,556
- She said you should've goneyourself.
- I couldn't.

384
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:10,658
I'm sureyou understand.
A place like that.

385
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:12,993
I sent my assistant, Mr. Hyde.

386
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:15,403
She called him a mad dog.

387
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:24,211
On those rare occasions...

388
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:27,683
when a woman like Mrs. Farraday
is not at fault herself...

389
00:47:27,753 --> 00:47:32,213
she is liable to experience
a rush ofrighteous indignation.

390
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:35,858
I happen to know that Mr. Hyde...

391
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,122
did everything that he could.

392
00:47:38,196 --> 00:47:41,188
The girl had already
lost too much blood.

393
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:44,827
These amateur operations,
as I'm sureyou--

394
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,839
Well, let's not
discuss the details.

395
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:53,003
Just rest assured
that I shall continue...

396
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,603
to look into the matter.

397
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,741
I suppose it would have been too much
to expect a bit ofgratitude.

398
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:08,420
I'm sorry I doubted you, sir.

399
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:14,925
I'm going to lock my door
and work.

400
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,458
Tell Poole he may close up
as he pleases.

401
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:21,472
I may not go back
into the house tonight.

402
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:46,852
Mary Reilly.

403
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,801
Doyou know who I am?

404
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,132
You're Mr. Hyde,
the master's assistant.

405
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,507
You may say so.
What doyou think?

406
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:10,612
I always had
an artistic temperament.

407
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:14,049
I know I owe my existence
to science, but...

408
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,883
I've never been able to whip up
much enthusiasm for it.

409
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,326
Strange...

410
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:28,560
the thoughts that come unbidden,
don'tyou find?

411
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:33,402
Ifyou mean we're not always
in control ofour ideas--

412
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:36,201
Why should we want to be?
That's the question.

413
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:39,402
I've never been
in favor ofcontrol.

414
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,678
By all accounts, your fatherwas
no paragon at controlling himself.

415
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,880
Men will chatter
amongst themselves in a--

416
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:55,393
What I wasn't able to find out
was how far it might have gone...

417
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,724
between your father
and yourself.

418
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:00,264
Didn'tyou look forward
to them sometimes...

419
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:03,768
those evenings when
your motherwas out working?

420
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,935
Still, wouldn'tyou like
to come in town with me tonight?

421
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:55,785
Good morning, Mary.

422
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,916
- Morning.
- What's the matter?

423
00:52:01,893 --> 00:52:05,385
I thought, sir, when we
spoke ofprivate matters...

424
00:52:05,463 --> 00:52:08,955
those were confidences
you would never repeat.

425
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,804
I'm afraid you've been
upset by my assistant.

426
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:19,803
No, sir. I was more upset byyou
thatyou told him.

427
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:22,369
As a doctor, I've always
been in the habit...

428
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:25,143
oftaking notes after
any kind ofconsultation.

429
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:29,448
I'm afraid myyoung man is less
scrupulous than he should be.

430
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,349
He read my notebook.

431
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,049
I see, sir.

432
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,721
Well, in that case--

433
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:43,894
I can't deny that his manners are rough,
but I've learned to look beyond that.

434
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,063
I know he likes you very much.

435
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:51,074
I see no reason whyyou shouldn't
become the best offriends.

436
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:54,669
As a matter offact, I was hoping
you would accompany him...

437
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:57,510
this afternoon
on a scientific errand.

438
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:03,944
I thought it might make a break
from this perpetual housework.

439
00:53:05,156 --> 00:53:08,284
Ofcourse, I'll send Bradshaw
ifyou prefer.

440
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:49,124
And now, to where they
butcher human meat.

441
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:52,288
This hospital and the slaughterhouse
share the same gutters.

442
00:54:52,363 --> 00:54:54,297
Most convenient.

443
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:20,387
Youjust can't say no
to our employer, can you?

444
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:24,561
And you believe
everyword he says?

445
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:27,496
The doctor's been
very kind to me.

446
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,624
He's much too old foryou,
ofcourse.

447
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,033
I don't know whatyou mean.

448
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:40,339
I keep telling him
he works too hard.

449
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:44,472
Areyou aware, when you're with him,
ofhow much he longs to touch you?

450
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,382
Ofcourse not.

451
00:55:46,451 --> 00:55:49,318
He conceals it that well,
does he?

452
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,514
I don't want to talk about this.

453
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:53,420
Whateveryou say.

454
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:59,089
It is difficult to understand someone
who is entirely incapable...

455
00:55:59,163 --> 00:56:02,724
ofsimply asking forwhat he most wants
in the world, don'tyou agree?

456
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:06,435
How can you presume to know
what goes on in the doctor's mind?

457
00:56:06,504 --> 00:56:10,873
Inspired guesswork.
Instinct. Fellow feeling.

458
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:15,770
- What does he want them for?
- I've never bothered to ask.

459
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:18,145
I just supply the organs
as required.

460
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:24,543
You've no idea
how strange and twisting...

461
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:26,556
are the ways ofscience.

462
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:28,216
Wait there.

463
00:56:30,662 --> 00:56:33,062
Afternoon, Doctor.

464
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:35,224
Visit from the butcher.

465
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:38,291
What's that?

466
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:43,864
He can't tell why, Mary,
but the doctor feels a bit hungry.

467
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,570
Tea and sandwiches, perhaps.

468
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:48,441
For two, sir?

469
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,913
Why not?

470
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,082
Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
would like some tea.

471
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,094
How doyou get on
with that Mr. Hyde then?

472
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,795
He manage to keep
his hands to hisself?

473
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:15,066
You shouldn'tjudge everyone
byyour own standards, Mr. Bradshaw.

474
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:18,700
Well, I hope Hyde was politer toyou
than he was to old Poole.

475
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:26,283
-What doyou mean?
-Beforeyou went off, he sent for Poole.

476
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:28,285
He tells him to get on the train...

477
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:31,481
go offto some chemist
way out in the country.

478
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:34,992
And when Poole says, ''Is there
anything else I can do foryou, sir?''

479
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:38,995
He says, ''Yes. Mind your own business,''
and slams the door in his face.

480
00:57:39,063 --> 00:57:41,497
Mr. Poole was that upset.

481
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:44,899
I wouldn't cross him
in the next day or two ifI was you.

482
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:48,700
He said to me,
'' No matter how well he speaks...

483
00:57:48,773 --> 00:57:53,107
Mr. Hyde could never be
mistaken for a gentleman.''

484
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:55,509
Who is he then?

485
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,311
You ask me, he's got one over on the
doctor. You know, a spot ofblackmail.

486
00:57:59,384 --> 00:58:02,547
Or, tell you what,
maybe he's a souvenir...

487
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,555
from the doctor's student days,
sort ofa grown-up wild oat.

488
00:58:05,623 --> 00:58:08,888
Now they do look a bit alike.

489
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,490
Mary don't like to think the doctor's
ever had any fun in his life.

490
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:24,502
Mary, you go.

491
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,457
Oh, it's you, is it?
Butler's night off, is it?

492
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:44,120
- What doyou want?
- A word with the gentleman.

493
00:58:44,195 --> 00:58:46,129
- Which one?
- HarryJekyll, ofcourse.

494
00:58:46,197 --> 00:58:50,065
IfI never saw that other devil again
in my life, it'd be too soon for me.

495
00:58:50,134 --> 00:58:53,433
- They're both in the laboratory.
- That'll do as well as anywhere.

496
00:58:53,504 --> 00:58:56,234
As a rule, the doctor doesn't
admit visitors when he's working.

497
00:58:56,307 --> 00:58:58,241
Oh, I think he'll admit me.

498
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:01,506
Very likely he'll admit both ofus
ifyou playyour cards right.

499
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:25,268
Wait here.

500
00:59:45,189 --> 00:59:46,781
What is it?

501
00:59:46,858 --> 00:59:48,917
Mrs. Farraday is here
to seeyou, sir.

502
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:51,553
- Who?
- Mrs. Farraday.

503
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,757
- What doyou want?
-Just a word.

504
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:25,353
Thought we might have a chat about
improving our financial arrangements.

505
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:28,865
Staywhereyou are.
I'll be with you in a moment.

506
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:31,128
There's something
I have to do first.

507
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:35,963
Don't be too long.
It ain't very festive down here.

508
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,305
- I'll bring the tea in a minute, sir.
- What?

509
01:00:39,377 --> 01:00:43,473
- Mr. Hyde ordered tea and sandwiches.
- Cancel the tea.

510
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:46,779
Hold your horses.
I'm parched.

511
01:00:49,253 --> 01:00:52,188
I'm sureyou'd prefer
something stronger.

512
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:54,952
It won't take me
a moment to prepare it.

513
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,256
Have ityour own way.

514
01:02:16,307 --> 01:02:17,740
Doctor?

515
01:02:25,316 --> 01:02:26,749
Doctor?

516
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:33,006
Doctor?

517
01:03:33,084 --> 01:03:37,316
I'm very sorry to disappointyou,
but it isn't the doctor.

518
01:03:37,388 --> 01:03:41,848
He chivalrously insisted on seeing
Mrs. Farraday all the way home.

519
01:03:41,926 --> 01:03:43,860
He told me he couldn't go
to that house.

520
01:03:43,928 --> 01:03:45,862
She's moved.

521
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:57,808
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Yes. There will be.

522
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:00,304
Come here.

523
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:20,127
There has been something
I've been trying to say toyou...

524
01:04:20,197 --> 01:04:23,360
ever since our first conversation
in the library.

525
01:04:24,435 --> 01:04:26,596
Yes, sir?

526
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,341
I--

527
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:36,938
I want to apologize
for some ofthe things I said.

528
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:39,448
Why?

529
01:04:39,517 --> 01:04:41,451
Because...

530
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,281
I was unnecessarily...

531
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:50,460
offensive.

532
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,545
Now lookwhat
you've made me do.

533
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:23,589
Don'tyou know who I am?

534
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,920
Mary Reilly.

535
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:58,914
Sorry. Must be
some misunderstanding.

536
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:01,253
I thoughtyou
invited me here.

537
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:11,490
I did.

538
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:20,568
What's the matterwith you?

539
01:07:21,645 --> 01:07:23,670
I'm sorry. Bad dream.

540
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:25,840
Didn't sound too bad.

541
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:43,829
Yes?

542
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:53,499
Mrs. Kent tells me
that while I was awayyesterday...

543
01:07:53,577 --> 01:07:56,307
you had some dealings
with the master's assistant.

544
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,779
Yes, sir.

545
01:07:57,848 --> 01:08:00,373
Did you hold much
conversation with him?

546
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,146
No, sir.

547
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:05,052
But I understand
a cup was broken.

548
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,488
That's right.

549
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:09,583
How did that happen?

550
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:13,329
- I dropped it, sir.
- You dropped it?

551
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:15,092
- On the carpet?
- No, sir.

552
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:19,397
- It landed on the fender, sir.
- I see.

553
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,701
- It should be stopped from yourwages.
- Yes, sir.

554
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:25,367
I'll discuss it with the master.
You may go.

555
01:08:31,181 --> 01:08:34,514
Poole tells meyou've confessed
to breaking a cup.

556
01:08:39,256 --> 01:08:41,486
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

557
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:45,517
After the storyyou told me
aboutyour father, I can't understand...

558
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:49,123
howyou could ever bring yourself
to sayyou've broken a cup.

559
01:08:50,768 --> 01:08:53,635
Especiallywhen
you didn't do it.

560
01:08:58,642 --> 01:09:01,076
Yes, sir.
I can't rightly understand it myself.

561
01:09:05,883 --> 01:09:08,477
I'm sorryyou don't
care for Mr. Hyde.

562
01:09:08,552 --> 01:09:12,955
- Who told you that, sir?
- Well, you don't, doyou?

563
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,024
He troubles me, sir.

564
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:26,035
Leave me.

565
01:09:43,487 --> 01:09:46,650
- May I open it, Mr. Poole?
- Verywell. Be quick about it.

566
01:09:54,865 --> 01:09:57,732
What is it, Mary?
Is it bad news?

567
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,770
My mum's passed away.

568
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,509
Mary, you come
and sit down a minute.

569
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,240
We'll makeyou
a nice cup oftea.

570
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,481
This is from her landlord.
Says she owes him money for the rent.

571
01:10:16,553 --> 01:10:20,683
Now, don'tyou worry. Mr. Poole
will speak to the master, won'tyou?

572
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:23,318
Yes. I'll take up
the breakfast today.

573
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:26,453
Yes. And then you can see
to things yourself.

574
01:10:28,332 --> 01:10:31,961
I've got my savings.
Nearly eight pounds.

575
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:34,469
Would that be enough to pay
for a proper funeral?

576
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,219
Why isn't she in her room?

577
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:53,723
Well, you see,
I've a heavy demand for my rooms.

578
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,725
Long waiting list.

579
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:59,229
- Where haveyou put her?
- She's quite comfortable.

580
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,958
Very snug really.

581
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:19,043
Now, the parish will provide
the expenses ofthe burial.

582
01:11:19,116 --> 01:11:23,143
No. I want her to have
a proper funeral. I can pay.

583
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,621
Then let me takeyou to a first-class
undertaker ofmy acquaintance.

584
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:29,420
Thankyou. I prefer
to make my own arrangements.

585
01:11:32,696 --> 01:11:35,256
And did you say
you were also owed money?

586
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,630
I took the liberty
ofselling off...

587
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:40,534
her few bits offurniture
and crockery and clothes...

588
01:11:40,604 --> 01:11:43,471
which, I'm very pleased to say,
cleared offher debt completely.

589
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,974
And, let me see...

590
01:11:46,043 --> 01:11:48,876
yes, a shilling over.

591
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:07,429
A poorwage
for a lifetime's drudgery.

592
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:09,431
Very true, miss.

593
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:11,433
This is a vale oftears.

594
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,691
What haveyou done?

595
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:14,920
You have a wonderful knack for being
in the right place at the right time.

596
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:17,364
Why areyou about
at this hour ofthe night?

597
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:21,234
- My mother died.
- Oh, yes, I heard.

598
01:13:21,305 --> 01:13:25,366
Oh, well.
She's not the only one.

599
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:28,741
Now I'm afraid I must
make good my escape.

600
01:13:35,218 --> 01:13:38,312
I supposeyou'll
never see me again.

601
01:14:11,221 --> 01:14:14,520
- Areyou the housemaid, Mary Reilly?
- Yes.

602
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:15,990
This way.

603
01:14:26,136 --> 01:14:30,368
- Mary Reilly?
- Yes, sir.

604
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,374
Where haveyou been?

605
01:14:33,777 --> 01:14:37,338
My mother's died, sir.
I had some arrangements to make.

606
01:14:37,414 --> 01:14:42,351
And when did you last see the doctor's
assistant, Mr. Edward Hyde?

607
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,713
Some time ago, sir.

608
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,655
Not in the last 24 hours?

609
01:14:53,397 --> 01:14:56,059
No, sir.

610
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:58,658
Another question.

611
01:14:58,735 --> 01:15:00,828
Areyou acquainted
with a friend ofthe doctor's...

612
01:15:00,904 --> 01:15:04,237
a member of Parliament,
Sir Danvers Carew?

613
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,493
What areyou up to?

614
01:15:34,004 --> 01:15:36,063
I don't believe so, sir.

615
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:40,405
But I understand he was a regular
dinner guest here at the house.

616
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:44,878
Reilly is the most recently
engaged member ofthe domestic staff.

617
01:15:44,948 --> 01:15:48,384
I don't believe Sir Danvers
has dined here since her arrival.

618
01:15:49,519 --> 01:15:51,384
I see.

619
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,454
Ifyou'll oblige us,
Mr. Poole...

620
01:15:54,524 --> 01:15:57,459
we'd like to search
the doctor's laboratory.

621
01:15:57,527 --> 01:15:59,461
I don't believe there's
anyone out there, sir.

622
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,327
Will you not interfere in matters
which do not concern you?

623
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,196
You'd best ask
the doctoryourself.

624
01:16:17,414 --> 01:16:20,076
May I be ofsome
assistance, gentlemen?

625
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:25,482
IfI had anywhere else to go,
you wouldn't see me for dust.

626
01:16:25,555 --> 01:16:28,922
The police found nothing here
or in the laboratory.

627
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:32,484
This place is
goin' to the dogs.

628
01:16:34,097 --> 01:16:36,031
Murder now, ifyou please.

629
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:40,035
He always gave me the creeps,
that Hyde.

630
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:48,871
What's to stop him coming back here
and skewering us when we're in our beds?

631
01:16:48,945 --> 01:16:51,345
He won't do that.

632
01:16:51,414 --> 01:16:53,678
You know him well, doyou?

633
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,615
Come on to bed.

634
01:17:07,864 --> 01:17:10,059
Still feel safe here?

635
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,272
I don't know
what I feel anymore.

636
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,976
Well, I'd watch me back
ifI was you.

637
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,281
- Mary?
- Yes, sir?

638
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:36,655
Would you step in here a moment.
I want to speak toyou.

639
01:17:36,726 --> 01:17:39,388
- Mr. Poole--
- Never mind Mr. Poole.

640
01:17:47,003 --> 01:17:49,631
Put those down.

641
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:53,540
- You saw him yesterday.
- I did, sir.

642
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:58,240
- You told the policeyou had not. Why?
- I don't really know, sir.

643
01:17:58,315 --> 01:18:01,512
Doyou know that whatyou've done
has madeyou an accessory to murder?

644
01:18:01,585 --> 01:18:05,715
Not telling the police everything
you know is a criminal offense.

645
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:07,723
I know that, sir.

646
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,918
My God.
I was at school with him.

647
01:18:09,993 --> 01:18:13,520
He was corrupt and frivolous,
but he didn't deserve that.

648
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:18,500
And he is an important man,
not easily swept under the carpet.

649
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,536
Not like the others.

650
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:23,205
What others, sir?

651
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:28,366
- What others?
- There were others.

652
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:33,415
Where is he?

653
01:18:33,483 --> 01:18:37,476
Last night he walked in on me
as bold as brass.

654
01:18:37,554 --> 01:18:41,251
He wanted money
to make good his escape.

655
01:18:41,324 --> 01:18:45,852
I made him promise to disappear
and never show his face again.

656
01:18:47,664 --> 01:18:49,655
What is it
you owe this man?

657
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:54,602
Why areyou prepared to risk everything
trying to protect him?

658
01:18:54,671 --> 01:18:58,038
It's myselfI'm trying to protect.

659
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:01,509
And as far as what I owe him,
as strange as it may sound...

660
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:03,512
Edward Hyde has liberated me.

661
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:06,913
I no longer care
what the world may think ofme.

662
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:13,685
It is marvelous
how much he loves his life.

663
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:17,454
And his victims, sir.
Did they not love theirs?

664
01:19:21,031 --> 01:19:22,965
Not as he does.

665
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,735
Not so ravenously.

666
01:19:28,171 --> 01:19:30,105
Sir?

667
01:19:31,574 --> 01:19:33,599
Sir?

668
01:19:48,892 --> 01:19:51,326
I trustyou
as I trust no one, Mary.

669
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:58,293
My life would be
a sad thing ifI--

670
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,508
What is it?

671
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:15,181
He is impatient.

672
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:35,667
Therefore, do we
now commit the body...

673
01:20:35,739 --> 01:20:39,004
ofour departed sister
to the ground.

674
01:20:39,075 --> 01:20:43,478
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

675
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:23,885
I wanted to make
a contribution...

676
01:21:23,953 --> 01:21:27,184
towards the expense
ofthe funeral.

677
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:37,759
Lookin' well.

678
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:40,894
And settled in service
in a big house.

679
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:43,939
- So I've been told.
- Who told you?

680
01:21:44,007 --> 01:21:47,465
- Your mother.
- When?

681
01:21:47,544 --> 01:21:50,843
Oh, I've seen a bit ofher
the past couple ofyears.

682
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:55,584
She wasn't one
to bear a grudge.

683
01:21:58,855 --> 01:22:00,789
I wasjust thinking...

684
01:22:00,857 --> 01:22:04,554
ifyou and I couldn't get
together again sometime?

685
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:09,460
The doctor tells me I'm not
likely to live through the winter.

686
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:18,063
Here. This must've costyou
six months' wages.

687
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:20,075
You keep it.

688
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,306
Why not? My money's
as good as anyone's.

689
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:26,507
Haveyou no heart at all?
I'm your father.

690
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:29,746
Haveyou no feelings for me?

691
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,922
We had our good times,
didn't we?

692
01:22:35,058 --> 01:22:37,151
Wehadsomegoodtimes.

693
01:22:38,228 --> 01:22:40,389
Youremember?

694
01:22:41,464 --> 01:22:43,398
Mustremember.

695
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,808
Did you miss me?

696
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:31,673
You promised the master
you'd go away.

697
01:23:31,748 --> 01:23:34,080
Easier said than done,
as it turns out.

698
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:39,144
- What did you do to him?
- Betteryou askwhat he has done to me.

699
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,747
The truth is,
I am your master.

700
01:23:41,824 --> 01:23:45,316
- What doyou mean?
- I mean I am the bandit.

701
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:49,388
He is merely the cave
in which I shelter.

702
01:23:52,669 --> 01:23:56,070
- Where areyou going?
- To raise the alarm.

703
01:24:04,647 --> 01:24:07,775
Last week, you saved my life.

704
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,785
Nowyou want to send me
to the gallows?

705
01:24:13,156 --> 01:24:15,090
Can you explain?

706
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:31,973
Can you?

707
01:24:47,156 --> 01:24:49,556
I feel differentlywith you.

708
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:53,254
Why should that be?

709
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,992
You still the rage.

710
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,699
Where does it come from, sir?
This rage.

711
01:25:03,272 --> 01:25:05,206
How should I know?

712
01:25:06,843 --> 01:25:09,277
It comes in like the tide.

713
01:25:17,053 --> 01:25:19,487
Now areyou beginning
to understand?

714
01:25:38,374 --> 01:25:43,209
Foryears now the doctor has been
suffering from a strange malady.

715
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:46,305
He experimented with manyways
to keep it at bay.

716
01:25:46,382 --> 01:25:49,044
But it would always return
more acute than ever.

717
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:52,554
Finally, he distilled two drugs...

718
01:25:52,622 --> 01:25:57,184
tested them, and understood
that he had found the cure...

719
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:00,195
which took an unexpected form.

720
01:26:01,664 --> 01:26:03,598
What form?

721
01:26:07,904 --> 01:26:09,838
Me.

722
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:15,035
I was the cure.

723
01:26:20,817 --> 01:26:24,082
The first formula
transformed him into me.

724
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:26,178
The second formula--
which he always refers to...

725
01:26:26,255 --> 01:26:29,691
rather insultingly,
I can't help feeling, as the antidote--

726
01:26:29,759 --> 01:26:31,750
transforms me
back into him.

727
01:26:31,828 --> 01:26:34,126
Lately, I've found a way
to slip his leash.

728
01:26:34,197 --> 01:26:37,325
To become myselfwithout
having to wait for the injection.

729
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,498
How?

730
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:45,234
Presumably, because
I am the stronger.

731
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:50,504
Is evil stronger than good?

732
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,571
You tell me.

733
01:27:05,862 --> 01:27:07,796
Please let me go.

734
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:17,704
I am sorry. I thought
you were planning to stay a while.

735
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,709
But perhaps my sense
ofsmell deceives me.

736
01:27:59,081 --> 01:28:01,606
Where areyou going, Mary?

737
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,623
The master's asked me to bring him
something from the laboratory.

738
01:28:10,693 --> 01:28:12,854
I'll take care ofthat.

739
01:28:12,929 --> 01:28:15,693
- He particularly asked I do it myself.
- I will do it!

740
01:28:15,765 --> 01:28:18,529
You don't know what he wants.
Please don't interfere.

741
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:22,871
And he's not to be disturbed
for the rest ofthe morning.

742
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:40,307
- Mary?
- Yes, Mr. Poole?

743
01:29:40,383 --> 01:29:42,715
I wantyou to go
and wait in my parlor.

744
01:29:42,785 --> 01:29:45,253
I have something to say toyou.

745
01:29:45,321 --> 01:29:47,255
Yes, Mr. Poole.

746
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:52,293
- Poole. Thereyou are.
- Yes, sir, I--

747
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:55,353
I wantyou to payvery close
attention to what I say.

748
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,558
You must make anothervisit
to Finlay and Sons.

749
01:29:57,633 --> 01:29:59,567
I'm very much afraid
theywon't be--

750
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:02,103
Will you listen to what I'm saying
beforeyou start raising objections?

751
01:30:02,171 --> 01:30:06,665
Three or four months ago
they prepared this at my instruction.

752
01:30:06,742 --> 01:30:11,076
There must have been some impurity
in the compound because since then...

753
01:30:11,147 --> 01:30:16,175
neither they nor any ofthe other
chemists has been able to reproduce it.

754
01:30:16,252 --> 01:30:19,847
You must ask them
to analyze this precisely...

755
01:30:19,922 --> 01:30:22,447
and then wait on the premises...

756
01:30:22,525 --> 01:30:27,087
until they succeed
in reconstituting it.

757
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:33,459
Tell them that this is a matter
ofthe greatest urgency.

758
01:30:33,536 --> 01:30:35,504
Life and death.

759
01:30:35,571 --> 01:30:37,505
I will, sir.

760
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:41,669
Mary, will you come with me?

761
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:46,842
At least there is someone
in this house I can rely on.

762
01:30:56,759 --> 01:30:58,818
I didn't know ifI could believe
what he was saying.

763
01:30:58,894 --> 01:31:01,192
But it's true, isn't it?

764
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:07,401
I kept thinking you must know
we were the same man.

765
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:10,234
How could anyone know such a thing?

766
01:31:10,306 --> 01:31:13,207
How could anyone possibly guess?

767
01:31:15,578 --> 01:31:18,012
I wantyou to do
something for me.

768
01:31:20,249 --> 01:31:23,412
I wantyou to go now
to my laboratory...

769
01:31:23,486 --> 01:31:26,046
and make up a bed.

770
01:31:26,122 --> 01:31:29,558
That is where I'll need to spend
most ofmy time from now on.

771
01:31:31,127 --> 01:31:33,891
- Shall I take this with me?
- No!

772
01:31:43,339 --> 01:31:44,772
Sir?

773
01:31:48,577 --> 01:31:51,171
He said you have an illness.

774
01:31:52,648 --> 01:31:54,673
What kind ofan illness?

775
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,355
You might call it
a fracture in my soul.

776
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:03,424
Something which...

777
01:32:06,162 --> 01:32:10,531
left me with a taste
for oblivion.

778
01:32:16,138 --> 01:32:18,072
You should've seen him.

779
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:21,075
Shuffling across the courtyard.

780
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:24,635
Hanging onto that drawer like he thought
someone wanted to take it offhim.

781
01:32:24,713 --> 01:32:27,511
Poor Mr. Poole,
run offhis feet.

782
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,949
And he's not looking
verywell on it either.

783
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,784
I'm afraid the master's
been put out ofpatience.

784
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:39,554
As I feared, his new consignment
ofmedicine is not at all satisfactory.

785
01:32:39,628 --> 01:32:43,257
There are a number ofbroken bottles
in the operating theater.

786
01:32:45,334 --> 01:32:47,734
I'll go and clear it up,
Mr. Poole.

787
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:54,308
Never mind.
Leave it till the morning.

788
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,715
Best to get it done now.

789
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:20,366
Doctor?

790
01:33:21,437 --> 01:33:23,234
Is thatyou?

791
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:35,609
Who is that?

792
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:18,032
What stops me from killing you?

793
01:39:06,181 --> 01:39:09,116
I always knewyou'd be
the death ofus.

794
01:41:13,542 --> 01:41:16,375
He took pity on me.

795
01:41:17,546 --> 01:41:20,913
Seems he took pity
on me as well.

796
01:41:22,084 --> 01:41:25,986
He mixed something
with the antidote.

797
01:41:27,322 --> 01:41:29,256
A poison.

798
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:45,905
Another cruel trick to take his life
and leaveyou behind to suffer.

799
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:52,106
It was the onlyway
he could devise to setyou free.

800
01:41:55,617 --> 01:41:58,347
It was inevitable
from the moment...

801
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:02,015
I found how to achieve
what I'd always wanted;

802
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:10,795
to be the knife
as well as the wound.

803
01:42:21,777 --> 01:42:24,940
Would you have
ever forgiven me?

804
01:42:53,141 --> 01:42:56,508
I wanted the night, you see.

805
01:43:05,153 --> 01:43:08,054
And here it is.

806
01:43:41,857 --> 01:43:44,189
You said...

807
01:43:44,259 --> 01:43:47,490
you didn't care what
the world thought ofyou.

808
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,934
Norwill I.
