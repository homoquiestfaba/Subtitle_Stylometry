1
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,587
         You want food?

2
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,889
         Uh, no thanks.

3
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,790
   Just a little more coffee.

4
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,461
            Thanks.

5
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,363
   Two bucks for the coffee.

6
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,181
     I have to go to work.

7
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,517
             What?

8
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,685
      I gotta go to work.

9
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,426
         So go to work.

10
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,931
       You think I care?

11
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:21,667
             Good.

12
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,367
          Go to work.

13
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,602
           I'm going.

14
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,404
       Get out of my way.

15
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,890
           I'm here.

16
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,225
       Sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,807
  I had something else to do.

18
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,508
  Your shift started at 9:00.

19
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,678
           I'm aware.

20
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
              Hey.

21
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,416
      Essentially, about,
      a few years back

22
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,985
       when Denver had--

23
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,328
     That man will go broke

24
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,896
     he's not more careful.

25
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,265
              Stu?

26
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,866
    I took money to the bank
    this morning

27
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,269
  and account's almost empty.

28
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,305
 I told you years ago he'd run
 this place into the ground.

29
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,508
    No one's talking to you,
    old man.

30
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,343
    He'll pull it together.

31
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,852
       Here you go--okay.

32
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,470
         I'll be back.

33
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,039
           All right.

34
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,078
       Warm you up there?

35
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,546
             Sure.

36
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,547
            Thanks.

37
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,516
             Mm hm.

38
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,684
      Are you new in town?

39
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,852
  Uh, just new to this route.

40
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,854
     You're a truck driver.

41
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,524
    You probably get a lot
    of us through here, huh?

42
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,693
 Yeah, I've seen my fair share.

43
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:28,760
   Probably doesn't hurt that
   you're the only town

44
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,862
         for 50 miles.

45
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,097
         A good point.

46
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,603
       I'll leave you
       to read your book.

47
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,480
  I can change those for you.

48
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,914
      I hate that machine.

49
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,916
     Yeah, it's sensitive.

50
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,551
         It's horrible.

51
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,823
         Sorry, I said.

52
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,410
         There you go.

53
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,811
      Where's the closest
      shower to here?

54
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,514
  Uh, motel around the corner.

55
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,681
    It's kinda gross though.

56
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,649
             Yeah?

57
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,884
     Why can't I use yours?

58
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,454
Heh, uh, you want anything else?

59
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,655
  I can think of a few things.

60
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,190
          Yeah, okay.

61
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,494
          Hello there.

62
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:14,032
        Hello, darling.

63
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,569
Would you like something to eat?

64
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,473
           Oh my God.

65
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,874
           Good job.

66
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,676
          I'm amazing.

67
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,845
     Yes, waitress, please,
     thank you.

68
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:32,083
     I, um, would love
     to start with your...

69
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,086
       oatmeal with milk
       and sugar, please.

70
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,222
           All right.
           Levi?

71
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,057
         Oatmeal, milk.

72
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,828
You think that's free 'cause we
put it on all the tables?

73
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,764
              Uh.

74
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,532
   Is, uh, is salt expensive?

75
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,767
         We pay for it.

76
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,135
That means it's expensive enough

77
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,605
     for you not to spill
     it all over the place.

78
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,841
           Yes, sir,
           yes, sir.

79
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,075
     I hear ya there, sir.

80
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,810
      You two should learn
      some respect.

81
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,911
         What did I do?

82
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,020
 So you got a break coming up?

83
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,989
          Not really.

84
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,869
       Levi, I have to go
       to the bathroom.

85
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,805
       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,507
       That's two of us.

87
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,268
 Does nobody work here no more?

88
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,315
          This yours?

89
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,783
       Ain't mine, babe.

90
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,419
     I thought you were
     getting back tomorrow.

91
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,887
     You left the light on.

92
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,158
      You have a bedroom,
      you know.

93
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,166
  Did you bring home any food?

94
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,067
            Nuh-uh.

95
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,211
        You wanna play?

96
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,480
             Sure.

97
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,115
      You wanna go first?

98
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:30,949
             Yeah.

99
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:31,750
            Too bad.

100
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,017
              Oh.

101
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,285
          Fran sucker!

102
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,825
      How is that new bar?

103
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,193
       It's a shit hole.

104
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,995
       Did you get laid?

105
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,333
          Yeah, kinda.

106
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,171
    Where's the lucky lady?

107
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,908
     I'm not bringing
     those girls back here.

108
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,111
      You can bring girls
      here if you want.

109
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,546
   Why you acting all weird?

110
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,848
     I'm not acting weird.

111
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,184
     Why aren't you trying
     to piss me off then?

112
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,462
           Francine?

113
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,199
              Huh?

114
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,468
       What're you doing?

115
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,571
        Going to sleep.

116
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,474
       All right, well...

117
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,508
       What do you want?

118
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,310
 Like, why did you wake me up?

119
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,512
    I thought you might
    wanna sleep in your bed.

120
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,451
              Ow.

121
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,524
 Do you wanna go get breakfast?

122
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,059
              No.

123
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,932
    Uh, there's shit to eat,
    Francine.

124
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,533
     Well, go to the store.

125
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,136
     Give me some money
     and I'll go shopping.

126
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,471
    Why don't you get a job?

127
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,410
What's wrong with unemployment?

128
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,246
      Um, it barely pays.

129
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,015
 It pays a dickload considering
 it's for doing nothing.

130
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,584
  You ever thought that maybe

131
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,553
  I have more important things
  to do than pay your rent?

132
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,457
          Not really.

133
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,359
          Well, I do.

134
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,094
    Last time I was working,

135
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,330
   when you fucked your boss
   and ruined his marriage,

136
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,531
    you just sat around here

137
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,200
      and listened
      to sad vagina music.

138
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,401
      That the kinda stuff
      you wanna get back

139
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,003
 to doing that's so important?

140
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,005
    You know, I don't throw
    your shit in your face.

141
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,543
         Yeah, you do.

142
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,411
           Like when?

143
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,213
    I'm not having this
    conversation right now.

144
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,282
       The fucking sun's
       not even up yet.

145
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,652
       I'm going to bed.

146
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,887
           You suck.

147
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,188
           Fuck you.

148
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,003
            Morning.

149
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,940
         Good morning.

150
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,508
     Want a grilled cheese?

151
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,277
         Sure, thanks.

152
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,022
          John called.

153
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,258
         Yeah, I know.

154
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
        It's good money.

155
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,063
  You really wanna be married
  to that guy again?

156
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,365
     The guy who came home
     at 6:00 every night

157
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,434
    and who worked
    on the house all weekend

158
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,938
  and who got up before noon?

159
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,275
 I thought you really liked my,
 uh, flannel trucker look.

160
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,513
   Sexier than the bank look.

161
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,382
      Hey, Ben, Eliza,
      your lunch is ready.

162
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,384
    Hey, the kids get
    the hats that I got 'em?

163
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,385
             Yeah.

164
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,553
    Yeah, they got the hats.

165
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,522
   Yummy, yummy in my tummy.

166
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,357
         Oh, come here!

167
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,192
        Let me see you.

168
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,060
         What is this?

169
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,561
       What is this face?

170
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,696
        I like your hat.

171
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,331
        -Thanks.
        -It looks good.

172
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,999
     They're never leaving
     the house in those.

173
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,200
Did you leave the house with it?

174
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,201
             Yeah.

175
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,337
  What did the neighbors say?

176
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,504
   They said, "Time to move."

177
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,039
        -They liked it?
        -Uh huh.

178
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,407
    -That's pretty cool.
    -And they liked the way

179
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,377
     I put mine backwards.

180
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,713
  How'd you get so much more?

181
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,448
      They call you "hip"?

182
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,716
          You're hip?

183
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:25,616
              No.

184
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:26,484
              No.

185
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,252
    They called me awesome.

186
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,355
         Really? Yeah.

187
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,723
      Of course they did.

188
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,525
       Why you look good?

189
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,462
     I guess I got
     a good night's sleep.

190
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,731
         Wanna come in?

191
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,200
           No.
           Not today.

192
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,185
   Well, what about tomorrow?

193
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,521
  Tomorrow's my birthday, Dad.

194
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,389
         Yeah, I know.

195
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,764
     Okay, I know
     you need to go, but--

196
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,715
   You know what we discussed
   about cell phones.

197
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,684
    No, not until you're 16.

198
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,559
      Jenny, why don't you
      go start the car?

199
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,501
      What, I can't even
      give her a gift now?

200
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,169
      I'm never gonna hear
      the end of this.

201
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,637
     You've made me
     the bad guy, you know.

202
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,306
 Well, let her keep the phone.

203
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,375
     Stu, I really don't
     wanna fight right now.

204
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,845
    You know, I haven't seen
    her in over two months.

205
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:34,846
     I took the night off.

206
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,247
           She's 15.

207
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,515
She wants to spend her birthday

208
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,351
      with her friends
      instead of her dad.

209
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,888
     She'll grow out of it.

210
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,124
         You look good.

211
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,860
     You still doing okay?

212
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,329
      Of course, Danielle.

213
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,331
    I wanna make this work.

214
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,340
 Look, I'll call you next week
 and we'll find a time

215
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,676
      for you to take her
      out to dinner, okay?

216
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,567
    Call me if you need me.

217
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,237
       I think I got it.

218
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,587
    How much longer
    you have on the dryers?

219
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,355
          Ten minutes.

220
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,603
     You have a son, right?

221
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,438
          Not no more.

222
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,642
         There you go.

223
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,377
           Thank you.

224
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,412
        What're you guys
        up to tonight?

225
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,313
         You going out?

226
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,814
     Just over to the mill.

227
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,683
     Yeah, Jim's gonna find
     us some strippers.

228
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,486
          Easy, Frank.

229
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,955
    I may have to find
    that Russian girl later.

230
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:05,856
       She's not Russian.

231
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,558
         She's Serbian.

232
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,759
         Is she around?

233
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,660
  Do you need change for this?

234
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,862
        It's all yours.

235
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,998
   What's she so pissy about?

236
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,471
           Bye, guys.

237
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,038
             Mm-hm.

238
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,607
              Yup.

239
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,053
      So what's your deal?

240
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,023
You just drive in the northwest?

241
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,125
        Yeah, I try to.

242
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,626
 I try to stay near my family.

243
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,800
     Got some time
     to play cards with me?

244
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,102
        Or you gotta go?

245
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,375
      Depends on the game.

246
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,909
   Depends on what you know.

247
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:03,647
     Ah, Go Fish, Old Maid.

248
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,915
I might remember a little poker.

249
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,586
     Ah, a cardshark, huh?

250
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:09,954
      Let's play Go Fish.

251
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,055
           All right.

252
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,824
      You must have kids.

253
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,826
        Seven and Five.

254
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,631
              Hey.

255
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,400
   Frank was looking for you.

256
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,113
            See ya.

257
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,081
        She's friendly.

258
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,886
      She has her moments.

259
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,521
 All right, you have any kings?

260
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,556
            Oh man.

261
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:48,726
            I...do.

262
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,194
        I was gonna lie.

263
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,495
           Don't lie.

264
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,863
           Thank you.

265
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,835
  So she's a friend of yours?

266
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:01,071
      I mean, I like her.

267
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,174
       That's half of it.

268
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,975
      How about threes,
      you got any threes?

269
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,077
        Mm-mm, go fish.

270
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,717
  She was a mail order bride.

271
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,822
            -Really?
            -Yup.

272
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,024
    Hm, I have one of those.

273
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,831
         No you don't.

274
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,165
           For real?

275
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,735
              No.

276
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:35,673
  Nope, my wife and I, we met
  the more traditional route.

277
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,712
      So you guys
      are still together?

278
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,949
    Yeah, just had
    our 10 year anniversary.

279
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:48,152
     Well, congratulations.

280
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,653
            Thanks.

281
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,059
           Me or you?

282
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:58,262
       Um...I don't know.

283
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,268
    Where are all
    the God damn customers?

284
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,241
I told 'em to go home so I can
play cards with this gentleman.

285
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:13,844
     Wouldn't surprise me.

286
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,513
            You go.

287
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,215
          How about...

288
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,584
             twos?

289
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,686
             Yeah.

290
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,821
    I got another one, too.

291
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,724
   Oh, you were holding out.

292
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,059
        That's not cool.

293
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,746
    Thanks for the company.

294
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,250
          I better go.

295
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,934
            Move up.

296
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,737
      Freckles On My Chin.

297
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,340
          For a band?

298
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:50,874
      I think that sucks.

299
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,945
     What about Tiger Cock?

300
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,116
             Bold.

301
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,019
        It's got a ring.

302
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,153
            It does.

303
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,291
       No, get your own.

304
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,227
   Come on, come on, come on.

305
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,795
      Yours tastes better.

306
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,301
            Mm, mm.

307
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,371
        Oh, that's good.

308
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,640
           Thank you.

309
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:25,843
   You gotta go to the right.

310
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,378
   Don't do that--
   don't, no I don't like it.

311
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,279
    -I wasn't gonna do that.
    -I don't like it.

312
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,981
  -I wasn't gonna do that.
  -I don't like being tickled.

313
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,049
    I was not even tickling.

314
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,350
     I don't--please don't.

315
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,753
 Cut the fucking shit out, man.

316
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:38,155
    Oh-oh, come on, come on.

317
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,024
 If you think that's flirting,
 then no wonder you're single.

318
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:43,827
 Francine, just 'cause you bang
 anyone that looks at you.

319
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:50,267
            Shut up.

320
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,368
    Then stop looking at me.

321
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,676
      Fuck you, fuck you.

322
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,425
Corey said you went home
with some slut the other night.

323
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,897
 So, when did you start taking

324
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,832
        such an interest
        in my nightlife?

325
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,100
           I didn't.

326
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:36,847
           Come here.

327
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,284
      Do you like playing
      with those guys?

328
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,786
     Those guys out there?

329
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,022
             Yeah.

330
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,824
        Yeah, it's fun.

331
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,926
       What if you guys
       don't go anywhere?

332
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,500
 Where are we gonna go, I mean,

333
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:57,968
we're not going anywhere, honey.

334
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,504
     Corey thinks you will.

335
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,073
             Yeah.

336
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,209
             Corey.

337
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:10,013
   Bless his heart, bless his
   little--little thumper.

338
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,417
           Come here.

339
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,451
       Come here, please.

340
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,920
      There, oh yes, see.

341
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,188
      You're right,
      we should make out.

342
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,256
      That's a good idea.

343
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,224
  No, I don't wanna make out.

344
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,359
          I'll start.

345
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,935
  You know, Corey can fucking
  mind his own business.

346
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,439
 I mean, what is he, your dad?

347
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,940
              No.

348
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,510
      He's not even
      your brother, right?

349
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,410
         Yeah, I know.

350
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,379
             Right.

351
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,449
       So what the fuck?

352
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,026
    I guess we could make--
    make love.

353
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,261
      No, I don't want to.

354
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:58,996
       Try that--have you
       ever tried that?

355
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,932
   No, I've never tried that.

356
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:05,435
       I heard it's fun.

357
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:22,152
     Hi, Jenny,
     it's your dad again...

358
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,988
      calling to see when
      would be a good time

359
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,491
   to get together
   for your birthday dinner.

360
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,460
 Better late than never, right?

361
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,597
  Give me a call when you can.

362
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,165
           Love you.

363
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,092
             Hello.

364
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:02,559
              Hi.

365
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,994
              Hey.

366
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:05,128
       Why are you here?

367
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,430
      'Cause I was hungry.

368
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,434
      How was your drive?

369
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,870
    It was pretty standard.

370
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,008
     Do you mind that I'm--

371
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,343
     Uh, no, go ahead,
     go right ahead, here.

372
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,911
            Thanks.

373
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,650
   So what's the attraction?

374
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,321
              Of?

375
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:35,125
         Truck driving.

376
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,261
         I don't know.

377
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,000
       Is that your rig?

378
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,668
            My rig?

379
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,203
   That's what they call it,
   right?

380
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:49,406
             Yeah.

381
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,375
      Can I check it out?

382
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:30,080
     How long you been
     workin' at the diner?

383
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:34,318
         Mm...12 years,
         on and off.

384
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,686
              Wow.

385
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,023
   Gonna stay working there?

386
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:43,427
       Mm...I don't know.

387
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,732
    You wanna give it a go?

388
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,736
             Okay.

389
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:53,637
            A drive.

390
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,274
           -Yeah.
           -Come on.

391
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,288
   All right,
   here's your lesson, ready?

392
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,457
             Mm-hm.

393
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,992
            Hat on.

394
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,126
           Thank you.

395
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,461
   See that key right there?

396
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,662
     -Mm-hm.
     -That's your ignition.

397
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,664
            -Yep.
            -Engine.

398
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,299
       Start right there.

399
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,068
         Clutch, brake,
         accelerator.

400
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,069
     You know what this is.

401
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,605
           -My stick.
           -Yeah.

402
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,773
   All right, so you're gonna
   put in the clutch.

403
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,241
             Okay.

404
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:34,644
     And turn the ignition,
     turn the key.

405
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,279
        Yeah, it sticks
        a little bit,

406
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,181
        just wiggle it.

407
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,118
         There you go,
         hit the start.

408
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,486
           Like that.

409
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,589
     And release the brake.

410
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,757
       -How do I do that?
       -Just punch it in.

411
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,125
             Okay.

412
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:51,294
           All right.

413
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,629
    So what you're gonna do
    is you're gonna

414
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:56,533
     put the clutch in,
     and let it out slowly.

415
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,534
      I'm going backwards.

416
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,568
       Gonna go forward.

417
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,536
          -Okay.
          -All right.

418
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,305
         There you go.

419
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,206
            Got it?

420
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,141
          I think so.

421
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,342
             Okay.

422
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,344
         Just give it
         a little gas.

423
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,481
   Start turning your wheel.

424
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,183
      I feel like
      it's gonna tip over.

425
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,419
   Mm-mm, just keep going,
   give it a little more gas.

426
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,288
             -Okay.
             -Good.

427
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,689
          Straighten.

428
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:20,791
        You wanna stop?

429
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,125
        Yeah, I need to.

430
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,693
       Put the clutch in,
       all right?

431
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,664
  And you're just gonna
  hit the brake real lightly.

432
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,166
          Ooh, sorry!

433
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,368
       That's it,
       hit the ignition.

434
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,604
         -Hit the key.
         -Uh-huh.

435
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,307
      Pull out your brake.

436
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,177
           That's it.

437
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,679
           Nice job.

438
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,481
         You're hired.

439
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,488
             So...

440
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,625
 ...how much does one of these
 bad boys cost?

441
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,128
         That depends.

442
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,566
      I got this one used,
      so...

443
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:05,202
        -It's a sleeper?
        -Yeah.

444
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,339
          It's fancy.

445
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,708
      It's not that fancy.

446
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,577
    It gets it done, though.

447
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,744
              Hm.

448
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:31,461
  It's bigger than
  what I thought it would be.

449
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,230
          -More books.
          -More books.

450
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:36,433
            Boring.

451
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,368
      I could sleep here.

452
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,522
  Do you wanna come back here
  with me?

453
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,934
       It's probably not
       a good idea.

454
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,672
           You sure?

455
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,476
              No.

456
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,466
           I'm sorry.

457
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,636
        Um...I'm sorry.

458
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,738
    You shouldn't be sorry.

459
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,382
     Wanna play
     with the broken radio?

460
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,518
   You saw me looking at it,
   didn't you?

461
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,353
             Yeah.

462
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,889
  It's more wishing it worked
  so I could call for help.

463
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,827
       Breaker, breaker.

464
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,832
   I, uh, am feelin'
   a little lonely out here.

465
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,868
             Yeah.

466
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,304
    It's really not the same
    when you know

467
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:23,306
      no one can hear you.

468
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,918
        You still early.

469
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,853
      I didn't get to eat.

470
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,591
         What you want?

471
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,762
        Mm...apple pie.

472
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,700
        Is good dinner.

473
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,971
     Want me to warm it up?

474
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:05,575
      No, I like it cold.

475
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:09,079
            Here is.

476
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,990
      So dreamy just
      for a truck driver?

477
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,058
            Shut up.

478
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,127
            It's me!

479
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,835
 The machine by the back door,
 it don't spin.

480
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,137
          I'll fix it.

481
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:09,072
          And you owe.

482
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,107
         For before
         and for this.

483
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,047
  Is your little girl coming?

484
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,184
              No.

485
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:30,660
    I don't have any cash,
    can I pay you tomorrow?

486
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,729
          You know...

487
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,999
        if you're happy,

488
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:39,803
        your little girl
        like you better.

489
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,438
      Thanks for the tip.

490
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,757
    -I'm on a break.
    -I didn't say anything.

491
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:34,157
     All the storage units
     have a number, right?

492
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,494
     So you have to, like,
     remember which number

493
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,829
   goes to which one,
   you know what I'm saying?

494
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,898
    I know, what's the point
    of the story?

495
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
  I'm just saying, there's
  this one that's been locked

496
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:45,935
       for like a while.

497
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,570
 -Probably just someone's junk.
 -Maybe there's something

498
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,572
     in there we can sell,
     I don't know.

499
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,641
It's probably not that valuable
if they're keepin' it there.

500
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,976
    They'd probably keep it
    at their house.

501
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,511
       I don't know, man.

502
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:55,745
       Can't you just go
       look at the record

503
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:56,713
       and see who rented
       the damn unit?

504
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,081
      Well, yeah, I mean--

505
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,083
         -Not workin'?
         -Not yet.

506
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,724
 Um, I was gonna go for a walk,
 do you wanna go?

507
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:08,825
             Yeah.

508
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,829
           -Hey, man.
           -Hey.

509
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,130
         How you doin'?

510
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,865
           -Great.
           -Right on.

511
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,906
         -Who is that?
         -Holy shit.

512
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,745
             Ohh...

513
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,780
            Yolanda.

514
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,081
            Jelena.

515
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,583
            Jelena.

516
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,257
        It's almost like
        you live here.

517
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,660
      Do you ever go home?

518
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,929
    I been pullin'
    some extra runs lately.

519
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:47,196
         -You cold?
         -A little bit.

520
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,932
             -Here.
             -No!

521
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:49,966
         You don't have
         to do that.

522
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,669
            Come on.

523
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,270
       I'm gonna take it.

524
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,246
            Got it.

525
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,760
  So those guys back there,
  they, uh, friends of yours?

526
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,765
             Uh...

527
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:30,740
       that's my brother
       and his friend.

528
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,877
      Seem like the type
      that had a brother.

529
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,716
      I don't--
      is that good or bad?

530
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,684
         No, it's good.

531
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,954
     You seem just like
     you can hold your own.

532
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,125
             Mm-hm.

533
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,198
   That's my foster brother.

534
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,403
      There were four boys
      and me.

535
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:11,414
     So, is this
     your dream come true,

536
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,683
        bein' a trucker?

537
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:16,252
              No.

538
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:23,326
     I was actually
     a banker for 10 years.

539
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,762
        D'you get fired?

540
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:30,967
     No, my branch closed,
     and, I don't know.

541
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,335
        I was looking
        for another job,

542
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,771
     I just realized
     I don't want to spend

543
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:39,909
      the rest of my life
      behind a desk, so...

544
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,077
    just thought
    this would be a good way

545
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,446
    to get some perspective.

546
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,017
              Huh.

547
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,257
        Oh, the jacket.

548
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:56,693
        Very nice move,
        the gentleman.

549
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,175
          Who's that?

550
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:13,743
             What?

551
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,181
        Who is that guy?

552
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,184
            No one.

553
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:22,719
            No one.

554
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,723
 Aww, don't give me that shit.

555
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:31,327
    You sleep with every
    single girl at that bar.

556
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,129
           It's true.

557
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,330
       Tell me about him.

558
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:35,898
           -Nuh-uh.
           -Tell me,

559
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,301
       tell me about him,
       he from here?

560
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:39,335
         He from here?

561
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:40,369
              -No.
              -No?

562
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,504
             Mm-mm.

563
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:43,039
    Where did you meet him?

564
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,875
             Here.

565
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:49,278
      He's a truck driver.

566
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,480
            Figures.

567
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,882
       You got something
       to say, Corey?

568
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,420
              No.

569
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,921
    I mean, I saw his truck,

570
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,491
    I figured he was
    a fuckin' truck driver.

571
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,994
       Wow, that's great.

572
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:10,800
     So you're...cozyin' up
     with truckers now?

573
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,502
     That's fuckin' great.

574
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:14,504
  Why don't you keep
  your nose on your face, huh?

575
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:17,440
    -Mind your own business.
    -That's so amazing,

576
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,876
    it's amazing--I mean,
    as long as I, you know,

577
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,511
     long as I get my turn
     once in a while,

578
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,246
      I'm fine with that.

579
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:26,816
  You are such an asshole, Ty.

580
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:28,785
        -Hey, Francine.
        -What?

581
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,253
   Could you grab me
   some of that toilet paper

582
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,955
  -and bring it home?
  -Get your own toilet paper.

583
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,463
           All right.

584
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,140
       Thought you had
       a handle on this.

585
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,328
  You told Danielle you quit.

586
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,463
        What difference
        does it make?

587
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,408
      I always thought
      it was a good thing

588
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,211
when a father wanted
to spend time with his daughter.

589
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:15,351
Well, my dad barely stuck around
after conception, so...

590
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:21,057
 I'm not really
 the person to ask about that.

591
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:26,262
 But...it counts for something
 that you're trying.

592
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,008
      -You all right, Stu?
      -Yeah.

593
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:30,059
      Has Jenny seen this?

594
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,527
            Nuh-uh.

595
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,805
      Why are you here
      in this shitty town,

596
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:46,475
        running a diner?

597
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,577
       What should I do?

598
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,350
      Sell your paintings.

599
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,585
            To who?

600
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,455
    There's people
    that buy artwork, right?

601
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:03,826
           Not here.

602
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,166
        Well, then move.

603
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,770
          Can't move.

604
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,408
             Yeah.

605
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,646
             Yeah.

606
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,789
    You should go to sleep.

607
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:41,097
    It's been a long time
    since you've been here.

608
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,099
             Yeah.

609
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,807
          Wanna stay?

610
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,749
          You know...

611
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,351
     you were the only one
     that ever treated me

612
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:05,488
       like a decent guy.

613
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,424
  Well, you are a decent guy.

614
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,793
   You're just really drunk.

615
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,804
    When did you get so sad?

616
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,667
          I gotta go.

617
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,302
             Okay.

618
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,878
             Okay.

619
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,312
       You like good tea?

620
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:38,781
       Mm-hm, thank you.

621
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,992
    Did your kid draw these?

622
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,560
             Yeah.

623
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,799
       How old is he now?

624
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,236
       He just turned 20.

625
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,271
             What?

626
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:06,609
   You do not look old enough
   to have a 20-year-old.

627
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,410
        I am plenty old.

628
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,555
      Don't you miss him?

629
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:23,659
    I mean, why didn't you
    go back after Carl died?

630
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,463
My son with
  mama.

631
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:30,866
  She don't want me come home.

632
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,534
           He's fine.

633
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,741
     Did you sleep
     with the trucker yet?

634
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,047
           I want to.

635
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:54,823
  But we both know
  how that ends up, don't we?

636
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,667
       Stu is lonely man.

637
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:08,470
  Don't matter who's with him,
  he's just...

638
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,473
           ...lonely.

639
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:12,975
      He'll never change.

640
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,515
           Thank you.

641
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,028
        You lonely now.

642
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,533
  But won't always be for you.

643
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,499
             Hello?

644
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:14,503
Hello?

645
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:17,373
             D.A.?

646
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,874
              Now?

647
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,892
      I'm sorry it's such
      short notice.

648
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,727
   -It's okay.
   -I've tried everyone else.

649
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,730
  No, don't worry, it's great.

650
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,667
     Um, I'll have my cell,
     so call me,

651
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:48,003
     for any reason at all,

652
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:51,774
   and I'll be back tomorrow
   by 5:30.

653
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,476
             Okay.

654
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:56,612
    Have you been painting?

655
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:57,980
              Nah.

656
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,652
      All right. Be good.

657
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,821
          Both of you.

658
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,824
             Corey?

659
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:45,093
         Get in here
         and clean up.

660
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,606
       Can I talk to you?

661
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,745
            Really?

662
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,048
   Well, I'm sorry, Francine.

663
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,917
  Can I do something for you,
  can I get you something?

664
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:44,119
   Ohh, what is up with you?

665
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,587
              Me?

666
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:47,890
 You're the one with cuntitis.

667
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:50,025
Look, you can have
your dickhead friends come over,

668
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,627
      but you've gotta
      clean up after 'em,

669
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,562
 it's really fucking annoying.

670
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:57,566
    -I didn't order that.
    -You always have a beer.

671
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:59,101
             Trent.

672
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:01,303
           Fuck off.

673
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:06,842
   I'm so tired
   of bitching at you, Corey.

674
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,877
     Yeah, well,
     that makes two of us.

675
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,951
  Look, can we just get drunk?

676
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:18,153
    I have to work at...no.

677
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,087
  What are you talkin' about,
  you don't have to work

678
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,689
     for like seven hours.

679
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,057
  You can get drunk and sober
  in seven hours,

680
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,158
       it's a known fact.

681
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,194
          -Oh, is it?
          -It is.

682
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,130
             Oh...

683
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:30,933
 I don't know,
 you would know, wouldn't you?

684
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:35,170
       Come on, just do
       one shot with me.

685
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:38,040
    Francine, we never
    drink together anymore.

686
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:40,576
       One fuckin' shot.

687
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,144
     Okay, fine. One shot.

688
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:43,345
             Trent!

689
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:44,580
             What?

690
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,048
       Trent, I'm sorry.

691
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,016
         Can we have
         two whiskeys?

692
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:50,018
              Yes.

693
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,951
          Is that me?

694
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,992
              Yep.

695
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,266
 Painting a picture
 that did not exist, my friend.

696
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,769
       -I have no idea--
       -She was studying.

697
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:16,838
    That's a very redeeming
    quality about someone,

698
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,240
        -when you're 16.
        -That's true.

699
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,876
      That's what Ty says
      to me all the time.

700
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:23,245
            Fuck Ty.

701
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,783
             Fuck.

702
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:28,917
             What?

703
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,787
   Oh my God, I need coffee.

704
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,089
     I'm gonna be so drunk
     at work.

705
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:35,357
       Who gives a shit?

706
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,727
    Your boss comes to work
    drunk all the time.

707
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,262
            He does!

708
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:43,098
            I know.

709
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,167
      I'm such a failure.

710
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:48,270
  Shut the fuck up, Francine.

711
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,138
   I'm the failure, remember?

712
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,307
        No, you're not.

713
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:57,879
  You have goals and you have
  things you like doing.

714
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:03,852
   You have lots of guys
   you like to do, Francine.

715
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:09,224
        That's so mean.

716
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:17,866
      I like this trucker.

717
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:21,203
       Come on, Francine.

718
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:23,305
            I know.

719
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:25,941
     'Cause that works out.

720
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,309
   Yeah, but he's different.

721
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:29,745
          He's like--

722
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,847
 He's like actually interested

723
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:35,417
      in my pathetic life.

724
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,453
     I'm interested
     in your pathetic life.

725
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:40,122
        You don't count.

726
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:43,792
 What the fuck does that mean?

727
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:44,893
        No, you're not.

728
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:46,862
           Yes, I do.

729
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:49,264
          I'm, like--

730
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,034
    You're like one of the--

731
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,770
     You're one of the only
     people I care about.

732
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:57,539
            Really.

733
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,958
             What?

734
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:19,127
             What?

735
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,062
             Corey.

736
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:22,531
      It's the last thing
      I need right now.

737
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:23,498
     What, you're leaving?

738
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,866
   Yeah, I gotta go to work.

739
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:26,201
Francine, come on, don't leave.

740
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:28,937
     Corey, some people
     have to fucking work.

741
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,510
            Oh fuck.

742
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,934
    Are we gonna get dinner
    or something?

743
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:01,036
        Oh sorry, um...

744
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,307
  my schedule's kinda strange.

745
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:10,011
      I usually eat dinner
      in the morning.

746
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,480
      So we're not eating.

747
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,049
     No, of course we are.

748
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:17,118
             Um...

749
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,022
       What do you want?

750
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,324
         Order a pizza?

751
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,064
What am I talking about;
It's your birthday, we should--

752
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:29,965
       We should go out.

753
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,867
     Where do you wanna go?

754
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,134
       How about Chinese?

755
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:35,437
       Eh, it's a drive.

756
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:37,305
     You have a car, right?

757
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,306
             Yeah.

758
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,541
          So let's go.

759
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:45,013
             Okay.

760
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,384
              Oh.

761
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:14,242
 And I think that is something
 that people need to know.

762
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,911
 People need to know about this

763
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,412
     because we're talking
     about the president

764
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,548
  that has an oath
  to Skull and Bones before--

765
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,418
   that, you know, supersedes
   the oath to the country

766
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,420
     and to our interests.

767
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:28,957
             What?

768
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:32,460
      First, you know you.

769
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,162
           I'm fine.

770
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:46,341
       Drink some coffee.

771
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:49,210
     Some of them got, uh,

772
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:52,147
      into the depths
      of the organization.

773
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,596
     Why are you so tired?

774
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:10,598
     I was up really late.

775
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,401
 Oh yeah, because you work
 the night shift at the diner.

776
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:17,706
             Yeah.

777
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,507
  When do you normally sleep?

778
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,243
  Oh, usually in the mornings.

779
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:23,712
     I'm sorry I messed up
     your schedule.

780
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:25,714
     Oh no no, don't worry
     about that.

781
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,318
    Are you done with that?

782
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,053
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

783
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:33,388
     You guys want dessert?

784
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,057
  I think my dad's too tired.

785
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,660
 Do you have any birthday cake?

786
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:42,297
    Um, I can see if we have
    something like that.

787
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,165
       What do you want,
       like, chocolate?

788
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,101
             Yeah.

789
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:49,437
     I'll see what we have.

790
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:52,374
            Thanks.

791
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:54,009
Thanks for letting me drive too.

792
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,377
       Mom never lets me.

793
01:06:57,414 --> 01:07:00,148
   Well, here's to my driver.

794
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,064
              Dad.

795
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,772
              Dad!

796
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,269
           How is he?

797
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,748
     We're monitoring him.

798
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,316
     He's stable right now,

799
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:11,252
    but he still hasn't
    regained consciousness.

800
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,821
    Doing everything we can.

801
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,665
              Hey.

802
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:03,238
       How are you doing?

803
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:03,838
           You okay?

804
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,672
             Mm-hm.

805
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:12,280
      You drunk, Francine?

806
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,581
             Yeah.

807
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:20,622
         You all right?

808
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:21,656
             Mm-hm.

809
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,332
     Are you taking me out?

810
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:38,406
         I don't know.

811
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,526
          So now what?

812
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,768
  What were you like as a kid?

813
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,508
    Where'd that come from?

814
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,710
  I bet you were pretty bossy.

815
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,048
     Maybe a little, yeah.

816
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,021
      Probably really good
      at everything.

817
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:36,557
          Not at all.

818
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:38,326
            Come on.

819
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,577
       Can I--Can I come
       sit next to you?

820
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,008
  Hey, there's somebody here.

821
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,719
         Hey, Danielle.

822
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,888
        You're up early.

823
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,591
         Late actually.

824
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:18,659
    Do you want some coffee?

825
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,663
     I assume the hospital

826
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:58,065
     called here about Stu?

827
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,470
   He was in a car accident.

828
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:06,474
      Oh my God,
      did he hit somebody?

829
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,843
     No, Jenny was driving.

830
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:09,911
           Oh my God.

831
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:11,512
          Is she okay?

832
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:16,017
 He's been drinking, hasn't he?

833
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,493
       On and off, yeah.

834
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,701
      Is he gonna be okay?

835
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,667
              Hey.

836
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:07,502
           It's okay.

837
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:08,202
           I'm sorry.

838
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:09,237
       Why are you sorry?

839
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:10,538
         I don't know.

840
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,875
           It's okay.

841
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:43,070
              Hey.

842
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,619
     She wanted to be here
     when you woke up

843
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:03,024
     but I made her go home
     and go to sleep.

844
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:06,260
     She wanted to be here?

845
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:08,229
     She's never even
     had a driving lesson.

846
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,107
     I thought it would be

847
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:22,276
      safer if she drove.

848
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,353
      She actually talked
      to me at dinner.

849
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,957
     It's been a long time.

850
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:44,899
    I'm glad you had fun...

851
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:47,668
     before you passed out,

852
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,004
      and let our daughter

853
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:50,972
crash your car into a guardrail.

854
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:59,080
  Once she sees you're awake,

855
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:01,682
and gets into her head that
she didn't actually kill you...

856
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,389
        That's it, Stu.

857
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:10,124
     You're out of chances.

858
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,872
        You going home?

859
01:17:57,874 --> 01:17:59,040
             Yeah.

860
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,216
I bet you're a really good dad.

861
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,723
           I can be.

862
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:17,191
     Take care of yourself.

863
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:24,699
            You too.

864
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,221
              Hey!

865
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,238
             Corey.

866
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,373
    Yeah, I know, Francine.

867
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:14,441
        I'm an asshole.

868
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:18,379
         Yeah, you are.

869
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:19,847
    You know, why don't you
    tell me why it is

870
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:24,351
   that I'm such an asshole.

871
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:27,922
         I don't know.

872
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:31,358
          I just--
          I was just--

873
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,196
I have to stop doing things I'm
going to regret later, you know?

874
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:38,566
              No.

875
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:41,502
            Come on.

876
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:42,870
       You're my brother.

877
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:45,539
I'm not your brother, Francine.

878
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,975
      We lived in
      the same foster home

879
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,410
         for two years.

880
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:52,513
        We're roommates.

881
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:55,216
 And yeah, you walk around here
 in your underwear

882
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:58,419
   and you're always leaning
   on me and touching me.

883
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,187
       I don't touch you.

884
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,893
       We're not related.

885
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:09,363
  It's not like it's illegal.

886
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:13,601
    And you act like you've
    never considered it.

887
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:15,436
   We had sex your
   first night at the house.

888
01:21:15,438 --> 01:21:17,004
           I was 16.

889
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:21,642
     I had sex with anyone
     that looked at me.

890
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:24,211
Well, some things never change.

891
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:38,158
 You're really important to me.

892
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,464
             Am I?

893
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:54,408
       I don't--I don't
       have anyone else.

894
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,678
            I know.

895
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,247
         Neither do I.

896
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,182
     Then can't you just be
     my brother?

897
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:10,057
          Ah, fuck it.

898
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,742
  I thought you were sleeping.

899
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:16,250
   Well, this fucking sucks.

900
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:19,586
 I'll come back and visit you.

901
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,221
     You're not coming back
     to this shithole.

902
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,424
            Shut up.

903
01:24:23,426 --> 01:24:25,659
  You know I'm gonna miss you.

904
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:35,636
           All right.

905
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:38,072
     So do I have to worry
     about a little poke

906
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:39,406
      if I give you a hug.

907
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:40,441
           Shut up--

908
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:42,209
          Ah, come on!

909
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:43,577
     I'm going back to bed.

910
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,428
        You have someone
        coming for you?

911
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,564
             Nope.

912
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:05,766
        You need someone
        to pick you up.

913
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:07,801
      I'll manage, thanks.

914
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:15,676
 --drizzling with an increased
 chance of rain this afternoon

915
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:18,745
  with thunderstorms the rest
  of tonight and for the week.

916
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:22,449
     47 degrees right now,
     low tonight is 42.

917
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:13,994
 I know you're standing there,

918
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:15,429
    I can hear ya breathing.

919
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:22,603
     I came to say goodbye.

920
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,938
 That's right, you're leaving.

921
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:27,608
         Well, be good.

922
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,811
     There's a first time
     for everything, right?

923
01:27:30,813 --> 01:27:33,947
             Yeah.
