no idea what it's supposed to be about.

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,724
It's... It's about alienation.

An alien nation? What?

00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,021
[chuckles] No, no. Alienation.

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,441
It's about Ignatius

in a world that wants
nothing to do with him.

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,531
Well, maybe he would find acceptance
if he wasn't such a know-it-all?

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,577
I think his showing off his intelligence
is just a way of protecting himself,

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,162
which is kind of tragic because

20
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,915
the alienation is
the source of his strength, but then...

21
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,417

00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,348
So David Blaine called me,
you'll never believe it.

173
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,671
He wants to know when you and I
will make magic together.

174
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,603
You do this every day.
Dunkleman, it's never gonna happen.

175
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,105
I made you a smoothie.

176
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,859
[chuckles]

177
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,904
Okay, it would be weird.
We've known each other for so long,

178
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
and dating a guy who's shorter than me

179
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,575
would just draw more attention
to how much of a freak I am.

180
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,179
Wait, but half the guys in this school
are shorter than you are.

181
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,829
Hence my conundrum.

182
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,749
Oh, ho, ho. I would love nothing more
than to hence your conundrum.

183
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,960
All I'm saying is let your freak flag fly.

184
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,213
Date a short guy. Wear high heels.
Do something crazy.

185
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,757
They don't make heels in size 13 men's.

186
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,467
Even if they did, I wouldn't wear them.

187
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,596
Look, I know I don't have everything
on your perfect boyfriend checklist, okay?

188
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,059
But, you know, I'd be willing to bet
I'm clocking in at around... 70%.

189
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,729
[stammers] Yeah, I mean, 60%.

190
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,189
Mm...

191
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,524
Fifty percent?

192
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,234
It's a very specific checklist.

193
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,656
I just think it's crazy
you won't go out with me

194
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,780
just 'cause what?
You think that at any moment,

195
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,574
some taller-than-you,

196
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,909
funny, intelligent, nice, perfect guy

197
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,494
is just gonna walk through that door?

198
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
I mean, that's... Come on. That's crazy.

199
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,375
[teacher] Okay, class, listen up.

200
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,310
We have a foreign exchange student
joining us today.

201
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,270
He comes to us all the way from Sweden,

202
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,273
and he'll be with us
the rest of the school year.

203
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,275
So be nice and please welcome Stig Mohlin.

204
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,988
Uh... Hey, hey... [chuckles]

205
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,199
Okay, yeah, okay,
the guy is decent-looking.

206
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,745
Yeah, that's, you know,
that's obvious, but,

207
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,529
you know, you don't know him.
He's probably dumb as a...

208
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,298
What's... What's he doing?

209
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
Okay.

210
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,975
[chuckles] He's perfect, yeah.

211
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,610
He didn't even look at me, okay.

212
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,631
It's the first time in my life that
I've ever wanted someone to look at me,

213
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,906
and he doesn't.

214
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,949
[Fareeda] Because to him,
you're not a tall girl.

215
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,242
I'm not?

216
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,705
Jodi, the dude's from Sweden.

217
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,832
It's an entire country filled with giants.

218
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,542
To him, you're just another girl.

219
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,672
- I'm going in. Teeth check?
- Ugh!

220
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,715
- Huge piece of broccoli.
- Where?

221
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,218
Liz, you're the worst.

222
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,886
Go get him!

223
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,348
Ugh, forever alone.

224
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,353
[Jodi voice-over] <i>Kimmy Stitcher.</i>

225
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>Travel enthusiast,
future real estate agent,</i>

226
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,526
<i>or some other occupation
that involves her face on a bench,</i>

227
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,404
<i>and one of my OTs...</i>

228
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,657
<i>original tormentors since childhood.</i>

229
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,868
[young Kimmy] Look, guys.

230
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,080
Jodi's hand is so big,
it doesn't even fit on the clay.

231
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,124
We're gonna need more paint.

232
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,834
[children laughing]

233
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,879
[boy] Kimmy's funny!

234
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,799
[playing piano]

235
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,892
And that's why I want to be
just like Taylor Swift when I grow up.

236
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,104
Taylor Swift? More like Taller Swift.

237
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,397
[laughing]

238
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,484
Oh, that's a good one, Kimmy.

239
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,290
Nice sweatpants, Sasquatch.

240
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,373
[giggling]

241
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,629
Hey, new guy. I'm Kimmy.

242
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,423
[groans] Well, Hi, Kimmy.

243
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,677
- How're you liking America so far?
- Oh, I'm liking America very much so far.

244
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,013
[in Swedish]
And America likes you very much.

245
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,973
You speak Swedish?

246
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,409
[Kimmy in English]
I speak a little Swedish.

247
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,769
Picked up back in 2012
on a family vacay to Stockholm.

248
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,771
Oh, it's so beautiful there, right?

249
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,649
Yeah, America's great,
but I do know nothing about New Orleans.

250
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,568
Consider me your cultural ambassador.

251
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,028
Walk with me.

252
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,772
[Jodi] Man, Kimmy works fast.

253
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,115
I mean, the guy got out of Customs,
what, an hour ago,

254
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,326
and she's already marking her territory.

255
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,535
Jodi, Jodi, Jodi.

256
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,579
Look, all right. I know you want to date

257
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,582
some guy that's, like,
taller than you and stuff,

258
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,957
but if you think about it,

259
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,461
there could be some major consequences.
You know, it could backfire big-time.

260
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,129
Okay, backfire how?

261
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,007
I'm glad you asked.
Let me paint you a word picture.

262
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,634
How long is this picture gonna take?

263
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,968
Just let me do my thing.

264
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:28,057
So, let's say that
you and Stig date, okay?

265
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,725
You, uh, fall in love,

266
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,185
stick together through college,

267
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,521
down the line you get married,
have a baby.

268
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:38,150
And the combined strength
of your tall gene and his tall gene

269
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,946
creates a zygote in your belly the size
of an above-average sized watermelon.

270
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,826
Okay? So that would mean that
that puppy's coming out Caesarean.

271
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,787
Through the side door. Do you really
wanna go through the rest your life

272
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,667
with a big, old scar on that beautiful
torso of yours, 'cause, you know,

273
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,960
it's what you're asking for.

274
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,545
He makes a valid point.

275
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,723
[both] Surprise!

276
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,433
[Stig] Ha!

277
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,245
Mom, what are you doing
with the jumbo Swede?

278
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,813
Well, he's gonna be staying with us.
We're his host family.

279
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,188
What?

280
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,376
Yeah! I wanted to introduce myself to you
at school today,

281
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,820
tell you the great news, but your mom
wanted it to be a surprise, so,

282
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,613
- surprise!
- Surprise!

283
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,407
- Got him.
- Why?

284
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,784
[chuckles] Mom, why, why,
why would you do this?

285
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,952
Because!

286
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,162
With all the chaos going on
in the world today,

287
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,249
there's never been a more vital time
for humanity to open our doors

288
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,710
to strangers from foreign lands.

289
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,505
Mom, the '60s are over, okay?
And you weren't even in them.

290
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,132
Oh, Stig, buddy,

291
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,385
we're just...
we're gonna have to ship you back, man.

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,971
This isn't a busted Xbox
you bought on eBay.

293
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,431
This is a human being.

294
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,642
A human being who wants to experience
what America is all about.

295
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,643
You know what, Mom?

296
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,897
You know what? What better way for him
to experience what America's all about

297
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,773
than for us to just kick him out of it?

298
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,983
You get in the car!

299
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,234
But I sit shotgun.

300
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,444
Now.

301
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,242
What should we listen to?

302
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,752
[playing Pachelbel's "Canon"
on wine glasses]

303
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,142
[man] <i>Wow. That is amazing.
That is really some talent you have there.</i>

304
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,019
[Harper] Man, do I look fat on camera.

305
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,022
Okay, for the next three weeks,
if you see me eating carbs,

306
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,732
I need you to slap me across the face.

307
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,442
No, I'm not doing that.

308
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,485
Okay, and since when did you start
watching carbs?

309
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,780
Since Teen Miss Louisiana.

310
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,782
I'm not taking any chances.

311
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,324
Okay, fine.

312
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,953
Um, but I...
I need your help with something.

313
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,496
Sure, what's up?

314
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,456
Um...

315
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,210
How do I get a guy to notice me?

316
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,253
Oh,

317
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,630
my...

318
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,382
God!

319
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,818
Okay, I've been waiting for this day
to come my entire life,

320
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,362
and I never thought it would,
but I'm so glad it's finally here!

321
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,587
- What day is that?
- [inhales]

322
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,975
Um, the day that you finally come
to your big sister and ask her about love.

323
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,185
To finally embrace

324
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:22,022
the sublime splendor that is a woman,
and to stop dressing

325
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,859
like a, no offense, very large little boy.

326
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,431
So are you gonna help me or not?

327
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,239
I'm going to <i>Extreme Makeover</i>
the crap out of you.

328
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,864
Okay.

329
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,367
Who is he?

330
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,869
He... he is an exchange student...

331
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,162
- Uh-huh.
- ...from Sweden.

332
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,124
- And, oh, my God, he is so cute.
- What did you just say?

333
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,251
He is an exchange student.

334
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,253
Just... What's wrong?

335
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,091
Walk away.

336
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,634
Excuse me?

337
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,012
Just walk away and
forget we ever had this conversation.

338
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,347
- Okay, but you literally...
- I said walk away, damn it!

339
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,307
[gasps]

340
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,934
[chuckles]

341

00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:46,368
Okay, Kimmy Stitcher is not insecure
about anything or anyone,

862
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,995
especially not me.

863
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,623
I mean, why... why wouldn't she be?

864
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,918
Because there's nothing
to be insecure about.

865
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,547
I mean, Kimmy's... She's perfect.

866
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,968
I'm... this.

867
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,638
Are you serious? Being tall is great.

868
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,725
Being a tall guy is... is great, but...

869
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,481
when you're tall girl, it's...
it's the only thing that people see.

870
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,025
It's not the only thing I see.

871
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,027
What do you see?

872
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,736
I don't know.

873
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,573
It's not a tall girl.

874
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,950
Just a girl.

875
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,246
A really smart, fun,

876
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,581
unique...

877
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,919
beautiful girl.

878
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,681
I... I'm sorry.

879
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,309
I'm not.

880
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,041
- Good evening, sister.
- [Jodi screams] Oh, my God.

881
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,298
What are you wearing?

882
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,009
Allie McKinney, Miss Teen Florida 1993,

883
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,387
states in her autobiography,
<i>The Crowning Achievement,</i>

884
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,766
that the key to a perfect-fitting dress is
to buy one that is three sizes too small

885
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,059
and to wear it two hours a day

886
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,979
one week before the event
to fit it to your exact body size.

887
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,897
Can you even breathe in that thing?

888
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,566
Just forget about whether or not...

889
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,734
Forget about whether or not I can breathe.

890
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,818
Okay.

891
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,447
What happened with the Swede?

892
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,784
Uh, we just watched a movie.

893
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,828
Okay, yeah.

894
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,039
And then he invited Dunkleman
to watch it with us.

895
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,207
Oh.

896
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,500
And then, uh...

897
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,752
he called me his friend.

898
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,254
[groans]

899
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,337
And then, uh...

900
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,841
then I kissed him.

901
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,012
[scoffs] Wait.

902
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,513
After all that,

903
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,308
you kissed him?

904
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,225
Mm-hm.

905
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,852
Yeah.

906
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,272
Who are you?

907
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,151
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't planning
on kissing another girl's boyfriend,

908
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,153
I mean, even if that girl is Kimmy, but

909
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,447
that's not me. I'm not the other woman.

910
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,032
I mean, I'm barely a woman.

911
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,618
The situation is getting very ugly,
very fast.

912
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,679
Why do you have to gaze out the window
when you're talking to me?

913
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,349
[mouth stuffed]
We're in uncharted territory now.

914
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,101
I mean,
if Kimmy ever found out about this...

915
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,165
Is that an English muffin?

916
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,128
No.

917
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,006
It's not an English muffin.

918
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,423
Don't...

919
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:48,966
I just...

920
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,260
[gasps]

921
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,847
Did you just slap me?

922
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,475
You told me to slap you
if I ever saw you eating carbs.

923
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,685
I did, but I didn't expect you
to actually do it.

924
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,649
- What if you left a permanent mark?
- Okay, stop talking about yourself,

925
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,330
and tell me how to undo what I just did.

926
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,193
[chuckles] You... You can't undo it.

927
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,362
You kissed him, and he kissed you back,

928
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,673
which means girlfriend or not,
you've got a shot at this.

929
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,616
You are forging ahead.
You are in the game.

930
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,242
Just like General Custer.

931
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,494
General Custer,

932
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,287
not who you think he is!

933
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,084
[sighs]

934
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Hey, Dunkers.

935
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,255
Are you awake?

936
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,507
What? Yeah.

937
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,175
Yeah, man, what's up?

938
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,678
I have to confess something.

939
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,931
I cheated on Kimmy tonight.

940
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,518
With Jodi, and she kissed me,

941
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,561
and I kissed her back, and I...

942
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,647
I didn't pull away.

943
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,733
Am I a horrible person?

944
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,778
[scoffs] No, man.

945
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,239
No. People...

946
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,951
[exhales] These things happen.
People have minor lapses in judgment.

947
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,496
[breathes deeply]

948
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,456
How was it?

949
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,296
It was different than when I kiss Kimmy.

950
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,174
It was really good, Dunkers.
It was intense and

951
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,927
- passionate, and I could feel her heart...
- Cool.

952
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,179
That's enough, you can stop now.

953
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,308
So what should I do?

954
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,146
Uh... You know, man, look.

955
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,230
Well...

956
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:32,738
You're already in a relationship,
you know, so...

957
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,531
So, um...

958
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,660
[stammers] I think you should probably
just focus on, you know,

959
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,789
nurturing, caring for and continuing...

960
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,167
that relationship.

961
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,253
Right, but Dunkers, what if I like Jodi
more than I like Kimmy?

962
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,546
[moans]

963
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,715
Are you okay?

964
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,842
Yeah. I'm fine. [chuckles]

965
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,968
Good.

966
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,222
Look, man, Jodi... Jodi's great.

967
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,806
Yeah.

968
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,559
And, you know, she smells...

969
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,313
like a late August midday sun-shower,

970
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,900
and she's got skin like sweet,
buttery whipped cream, but...

971
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,614
You, my friend, are dating the hottest,

972
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,408
most popular, most sought-after girl
in the whole school, so,

973
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,454
you know, if you keep that up,
you're in line to be Homecoming King.

974
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,373
That's a... You know, we don't
take that lightly around here.

975
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,416
Right.

976
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,544
Soon enough, you'll be back in Sweden

977
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:33,215
and, you know,
you'll be living my life again. Ugh!

978
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,760
Right? So you should take advantage
of the moment, man.

979
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,679
This is your chance to be Ingvar Krueger.

980
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,389
- Right.
- Yeah.

981
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,477
- But here's the thing.
- Mm-hm.

982
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,397
- I could still be friends with Jodi?
- Eh...

983
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,108
- Really? No?
- I...

984
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,112
[stammers] I just think you might be...
That might lead her on,

985
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,032
you know, and it's probably best
for you to cut things off,

986
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,617
just cold turkey.

987
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,452
You know, it's the American way.

988
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,787
Yes.

989
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,706
[sighs]

990
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,332
All right.

991
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,919
- I'm... I'm glad I have you, man.
- Yeah.

992
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,505
I appreciate your honesty.
That means a lot to me.

993
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,048
Mm-hm.

994
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,968
You kissed Stig?

995
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,344
Could you keep your voice down?

996
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,179
- Am I shouting?
- Yes.

997
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,349
Sorry. But it's a big deal,
your first kiss!

998
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,434
So how was it? Give me the deets.

999
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,937
Pretty perfect.

1000
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,290
I mean, other than the fact
that he's dating someone else.

1001
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,816
But am I a terrible person?

1002
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,193
No, you're not. She is.

1003
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,571
She doesn't deserve him. You do.

1004
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,447
And I gotta say,

1005
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,907
I like new Jodi.

1006
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,576
New Jodi?

1007
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,662
"Face your fears" Jodi.
"Going after what you want" Jodi.

1008
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,582
"Look at me 'cause I look good" Jodi.

1009
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,893
it's about time you start following
your own advice.

1010
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,711
And when did I ever give that advice?

1011
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,006
To me. When you convinced me
to stand up to my parents

1012
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,089
and tell them I wanted to go to fashion
school instead of becoming a doctor.

1013
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,302
Ah. Right.

1014
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,139
Do you think they're ever gonna
forgive me about that?

1015
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,433
Oh, no. You're dead to them.

1016
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,643
What's that girl trying to prove?

1017
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,355
What, does she think makeup and
a new haircut's gonna make her less ugly?

1018
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,735
Do you think she's less ugly?

1019
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:22,032
Uh, no, no. No. She's, like, you know,
the same amount of ugly, right?

1020
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,657
[Kimmy] You're lying.

1021
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,075
Huh?

1022
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,912
All right, yeah. I mean, look at her.

1023
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,249
Look at her, she's so confident
and feeling herself and...

1024
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,294
She's like an independent woman
with golden locks.

1025
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,588
She looks kinda hot.

1026
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,800
Look, you better watch your back.

1027
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,803
[in German] She should watch hers.

1028
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,972
[in English] Here he comes.

1029
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,739
What happened last night?
You didn't respond to my text messages.

1030
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,950
Uh...

1031
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,118
Yeah, that was funny, actually.

1032
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,496
I... I left my phone on "off".

1033
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,579
Mm.

1034
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,915
Silent, I mean.

1035
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,542
No, I think it might be broken.

1036
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,382
Oh! Dunkers, man! We got a spot.

1037
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,051
Uh, no, that's fine. I'm just gonna...

1038
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,136
No, you're coming over here. Come on.

1039
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,557
Okay.

1040
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,519
This is my roommate. This is Dunkers.

1041
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,354
Yeah, uh, well, my name's Dunkleman,

1042
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,816
and I feel like I'm more of a landlord
than a roommate, so...

1043
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,485
[chuckles] Landlord! You're so funny.

1044
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,195
He's actually very funny.

1045
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,947
He does these impressions of people.

1046
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,073
What, impressions?

1047
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,384
- I don't think...
- The chef one.

1048
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,450
Gordon Ramsay.

1049
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,636
- I don't do...
- [Liz] Let's see it.

1050
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,494
- Mm-hm.
- Let's see it!

1051
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,377
- He's so good at this.
- Yeah, Gordon Ramsay.

1052
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,849
He's like, [in British accent] "You've
been braising that turkey for 15 minutes.

1053
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,873
Where's the lamb sauce?"

1054
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,959
[all laughing]

1055
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,336
No, do it. Come on, here. With this.

1056
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,563
- Oh, with the sushi?
- Yeah. Please.

1057
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,300
[in British accent] "Me nan could make
better sushi than this, and she's blind"!

1058
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,718
- Do the sandwich!
- "You donut."

1059
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,529
[in normal voice]
This, I actually love the sandwich bit.

1060
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,406
- [in British accent] "What are you"?
- I don't know!

1061
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,140
"An idiot sandwich"!

1062
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,392
Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart!

1063
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,496
- [Jake in normal voice] Sure, yeah, Kevin.
- In Sweden, they're crazy about this guy.

1064
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,230
All right, all right, all right!

1065
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,357
Yeah, you know Kevin, how he does that?

1066
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,193
That's not a Matthew McConaughey thing.
Kevin did it first, actually.

1067
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,070
You know, walk up to him and he's like...

1068
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,990
What am I watching?

1069
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,825
Unclear.

1070
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,579
<i>♪ All my people up
Plus the sky is up ♪</i>

1071
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,999
You're not really gonna eat Glutio's,
are you?

1072
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,082
They taste like sawdust.

1073
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,503
Well, I can't have gluten and so,
you know, kid's gotta snack.

1074
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,090
How about... Try one of these?

1075
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,509
You're gluten-free?

1076
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,802
Since 2012, baby.

1077
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,428
All right.

1078
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,935
Hold up, no. That is not gluten-free.

1079
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,426
- Who makes these?
- Girls Gone Vegan on Chestnut Street.

1080
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,564
I'll take you.

1081
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,942
Where have you been my whole life?

1082
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,781
- I was talking to the cookie.
- Cookie. Yeah. Okay.

1083
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,699
Keep it.

1084
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,083
So, what, am I not cool enough for you
to sit and have lunch with anymore?

1085
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,417
No, I was just, um...

1086
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,962
Stig asked me to sit by him for lunch,
and I didn't want to be rude.

1087
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,383
Did he say anything to you
about me recently?

1088
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,635
- Like what?
- I don't know.

1089
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,389
He just avoided me all day today, and I
thought we had a fun night last night.

1090
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,141
- Yeah, I bet you did.
- Excuse me?

1091
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,309
[Jack] What? Nothing.

1092
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,353
He did say something. What did he say?

1093
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,939
- I don't know.
- Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

1094
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,358
What did he tell you?

1095
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,442
[Jack groans]

1096
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,320
- Well, he said you guys kissed, okay?
- He what?

1097
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,884
You're going after a taken man, Jodi.

1098
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,092
There's plenty of other guys out there,
available ones.

1099
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,325
Just tell me what he said.

1100
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,245
He said he didn't know who he liked more,
you or Kimmy.

1101
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,704
He said that? Then what'd you say?

1102
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,749
I merely implied that, you know,
maybe he should focus on the relationship

1103
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,376
he's already in with Kimmy.

1104
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,921
Oh, so you're looking out for Kimmy now?
I thought you're supposed to be my friend.

1105
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,005
I am your friend.

1106
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,508
But if you can't have me, nobody can,
isn't that the idea?

1107
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,051
Jodi, don't flatter yourself.

1108
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,679
I actually have a date with Liz
to go to a gluten-free bakery.

1109
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,640
Mm. The start of the beginning
of no great love story ever.

1110
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,101
You may find this hard to believe,
but I care about you

1111
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,520
and I just want to make sure
that you don't get hurt.

1112
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,358
Ow!

1113
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,195
What's happened to you?

1114
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,822
Biking's for losers.

1115
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,490
Hey, can I...

1116
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,991
Can I talk to you?

1117
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,952
Yeah, sure. Come in.

1118
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,415
So, uh...

1119
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,875
What's up?

1120
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,421
Oh, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
that I kissed you last night.

1121
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,423
- Oh, uh, that's okay.
- No.

1122
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:52,093
It's not. I mean, you have a girlfriend,
and I basically threw myself at you,

1123
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,054
which is probably why you...
blew me off today.

1124
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,265
I just didn't know what to say, honestly.

1125
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,100
No, no, no,
you don't have to say anything.

1126
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,729
You know, in fact, feel free
to just keep blowing me off.

1127
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,314
Really?

1128
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,607
- Yeah.
- Why?

1129
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:10,612
Because if you don't, then I'm just gonna
get my hopes up about happy endings

1130
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:14,824
that only happen in movies
with actresses that are under six feet.

1131
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,037
I... I'd still like to be friends,
Jodi, at least.

1132
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,414
Right, yeah. Friends, like,

1133
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,551
let's just forget that we kissed
and move on

1134
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,335
- like nothing ever happened.
- Yeah.

1135
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,794
- We could do that, right?
- Right.

1136
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,087
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1137
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,088
Oh, great.

1138
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,673
- Yeah, great.
- Good, good.

1139
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,841
- Awesome.
- Um...

1140
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,219
- [chuckles]
- I...

1141
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,303
High five.

1142
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,806
- Pfft. Higher five.
- Oh.

1143
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,026
[marching band music playing]

1144
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,711
[Fareeda] Okay, so then how did this end?

1145
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,449
Other than a few scratches, he's fine,

1146
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,368
but we're not on speaking terms
at the moment.

1147
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,496
- Is this your first fight ever?
- I think so.

1148
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,299
He didn't even start the day off
with one of his cheesy pickup lines.

1149
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,918
[inhales] So what are you gonna do
about Stig?

1150
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,171
Nothing. He made his choice.

1151
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,131
You don't need him. There'll be more.

1152
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,590
Yeah, well,

1153
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,928
me not getting the guy was always
how this was supposed to end.

1154
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,473
[music continues playing]

1155
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,934
Forget about them.

1156
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,060
Let's go dance.

1157
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,811
Jodi.

1158
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,730
Get in here.

1159
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,731
Pass.

1160
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,610
Not dancing to your high school marching
band before homecoming is bad juju.

1161
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,153
I'll risk it.

1162
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,542
[indistinct chatter]

1163
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,304
[Kimmy] Hey, Jodi.

1164
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,014
We need to talk.

1165
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:03,975
About what?

1166
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,058
About a guy.

1167
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,770
It's come to my attention,
is very into you.

1168
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,189
- Look, I did not mean for anything...
- Schnipper.

1169
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,858
Schnipper?

1170
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,860
He digs your new look.

1171
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,996
We're all going
to the escape room on Friday,

1172
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,156
and you should come.

1173
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,319
Okay, I'm not falling
for another one of your tricks.

1174
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:23,202
It's not a trick.
He told me to come over and invite you.

1175
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,288
And why should I believe you?

1176
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,474
'Cause I know I haven't always been
the nicest to you,

1177
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,126
but consider this
my way of making it up to you.

1178
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,752
[in Italian] Bye.

1179
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,527
[in English] What did that biatch want?

1180
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,763
She just invited me to hang out
Friday night.

1181
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,891
- Why?
- Because apparently Schnipper likes me.

1182
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,661
- They're messing with you again.
- Yeah. That's what I thought.

1183
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,229
But she sounded kind of genuine.

1184
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,939
Oh, you're dreaming.

1185
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,901
Is it really that hard to believe
that Schnipper would like me?

1186
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,984
Yes.

1187
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,321
All the guy does is make fun of you.

1188
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,783
And even if it were true, why would you
wanna go out with Schnipper?

1189
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:06,663
Maybe if Stig saw that I moved on,
he would realize that he made a mistake.

1190
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,165
Okay, but we have tickets to
Tank and the Bangas on Friday.

1191
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,626
And I'm sure you can find
someone else to go with.

1192
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,879
Wow, so now you're flaking on me?

1193
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,132
Why are you giving me
such a hard time about this?

1194
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,719
Why are you acting so crazy over a guy
who, you just admitted two minutes ago,

1195
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,845
was never going to happen?

1196
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,139
Do you really need validation that badly?

1197
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,683
If you're not going to have my back,

1198
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,602
I would really just prefer
you keep your opinions to yourself.

1199
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,608
Don't worry, I will.

1200
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,173
Welcome

to <i>Maison</i> Voodoo.

1202
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,888
It was there

1203
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,975
where me and my entire clan were murdered

1204
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,519
just last night.

1205
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,231
Now, you have exactly one hour...

1206
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,234
To hunt for clues, find the killer,
meet the same fate, blah, blah, blah.

1207
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,957
It's not our first rodeo. Just let us in.

1208
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,696
[sighs]

1209
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,615
Whatever. I get paid either way.

1210
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,117
Uh, wait right there.

1211
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,956
[Kimmy] So, where's
the Homecoming hangout this year?

1212
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,628
[Jack] Uh...

1213
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,592
I mean, well, my mom's going out of town
on a yoga retreat that weekend,

1214
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,511
so I guess I can have
a little get-together at mine.

1215
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,512
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1216
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,764
That's perfect.

1217
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,056
Party at Dunkleman's!

1218
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,224
No, no, get-together.

1219
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,102
- Party!
- Get-together!

1220
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,396
- Get-together.
- Party, party, party! Party.

1221
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,942
Get-together. I said...
You guys heard me, right?

1222
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,776
[phone ringing]

1223
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:00,901
- It's a party.
- Get...

1224
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,028
- Hello?
- Mm-hm.

1225
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,696
[indistinct chatter]

1226
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,614
[Jack] What?

1227
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,367
Oh. Uh, okay. All right.

1228
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,496
First clue's in the parlor upstairs.

1229
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,915
Stiggy. Stiggy, come on.

1230
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:20,254
So, since when do you throw parties
or get-togethers?

1231
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,965
Well, I'm hanging out with
a pretty popular crew now,

1232
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,383
so it's sort of expected of me.

1233
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,636

Neither is that.

1266

Thanks for meeting me.

1269
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,466
Sure.

1270
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,344
What was so important
you needed to meet in private?

1271
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:17,723
Well, you know that whole plan we had
about, "Let's forget we kissed"?

1272
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,265
Yeah.

1273
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,851
I hate that plan.

1274
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,854
It's a really terrible plan that we made.

1275
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,188
I, uh...

1276
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,501
I mean, it means I have to see you
kissing Schnipper...

1277
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,111
Which is never gonna happen again.

1278
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,405
- Thank God.
- I honestly did that to make you jealous.

1279
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,948
Well, that worked.

1280
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:36,826
Genius on my part, then. [chuckles]

1281
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,160
Look, Jodi, I...

1282
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,580
I'll end it with Kimmy
if it means I can be with you.

1283
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,501
I was thinking I would do it tonight,
and, um...

1284
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,712
maybe we could meet up after?

1285
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,549
I, uh, I... I can't tonight.

1286
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,676
It's my sister's pageant.

1287
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,511
Right.

1288
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,889
I mean, unless you want to be my plus-one.

1289
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,933
You mean, like, a date?

1290
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,936
Yeah, like a date.

1291
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,023
- I'd love to.
- [Jodi laughs]

1292
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,316
And then we could go
to Dunker's party together.

1293
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,901
But on one condition.

1294
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,446
You be my date

1295
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,364
for Homecoming?

1296
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,159
Yes, of course.

1297
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,415
So, Stig is coming with you tonight,

1298
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:26,542
- and he asked you to Homecoming?
- That's right.

1299
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:30,212
Okay, this is all possible because he's
breaking up with Kimmy to be with you?

1300
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,007
Which I feel bad about, but...

1301
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,259
yeah, he is.

1302
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,013
What... What's wrong?

1303
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,725
Nothing. Nothing's...
Nothing's wrong. Um...

1304
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,935
Y... You know, it was just...

1305
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,729
I don't know. It was...

1306
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,356
It was nice when
you needed me for something.

1307
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,699
We'll probably just go back to
you never needing me for anything again.

1308
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:54,694
What do you mean?

1309
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,031
Well, up until last month,

1310
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,994
you've never really needed my help
for anything.

1311
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:03,412
Well, I... I wanted to, you know,
talk to you about stuff, but...

1312
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,206
Why didn't you?

1313
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,750
I don't know, just because

1314
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,461
you were just busy with all your pageants,

1315
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,880
and I just figured
that you weren't interested.

1316
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,093
You mean more to me

1317
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,220
than any stupid crown.

1318
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,225
Then I guess I will come to you
about stuff, then.

1319
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:26,726
Okay.

1320
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:28,854
Okay.

1321
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:30,563
Yeah.

1322
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,942
I mean, who else would I talk to?

1323
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:36,070
You're my... You're my big sister.

1324
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,282
You're my big little sister.

1325

Late, obviously.

1329
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,348
- But he's definitely coming?
- Yes, he's coming.

1330
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:07,768
Okay, sorry.
We're just so excited to meet him.

1331

I'm serious.
I'm gonna run over Stig with the car.

1376
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,322
Okay, then you'll go to jail.

1377

[father] Yeah, well, then I'll do my time
like a man, because

Ah, Jodi, I'm... I'm sorry.
Can I explain, please?

1402
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,266
Please, yeah, explain.

1403
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,477
I had to help Dunkers
with the party all day,

1404
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,437
and then people started showing up early,

1405
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,815
and, I don't know, it got crazy.

1406
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,734

I'm sorry.

1409
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,993
I was going to, I was, but then she kept
getting pulled into conversations,

1410
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,037
and I wanted, like,
a quiet moment to do it,

1411
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,415
- you know? So I just...
- Stig, Stig, quick selfie, dude.

1412
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,667
Yeah. All right, yeah.

1413
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,603
- Nice! Yes! Love you, bro.
- Does it work?

1414
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,087
All right. Yeah, you too, man!

1415
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:49,633
What?

1416
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:51,468
You're not breaking up with Kimmy.

1417
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:53,345
You never were.

1418
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,638
Jodi, why would you say that?

1419
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,849
Because you like being the popular guy.

1420
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:02,229
Much more than you like me, so...

1421
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,148
No. Jodi.

1422
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,607
Hey, come on. Come back.

1423
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,776
Stig, over here, man.
You gotta check this out.

1424
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,870
Do you... Do you have a date yet?

1425
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:19,830
I do not.

1426
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,416
Do you want to go with me?

1427
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,668
I do, yeah.

1428
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,044
[both chuckle]

1429
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:29,965
And I don't.

1430

I do and I don't.

1431
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,262
I'm confused. I thought you liked me.

1432
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,431
I do, I do. I'm just, uh...

1433
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,142

1435
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:45,521
I know.

1436
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,775
- What?
- Yeah.

1437
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,986
I see the way that you look at Jodi.

1438
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,491
So why aren't you guys together?

1439
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,996
Um, I don't... I don't know.
I guess I'm just not her type.

1440
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:04,791
So you're gonna spend the rest of
your life waiting until you are her type?

1441
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,962
If that's what it takes, then, yeah.

1442
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:11,756
Okay.

1443
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,010
I'm sorry. I know you must hate me.

1444
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,512
I'm bummed.

1445
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:18,722
But I don't hate you.

1446
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,143
Your art, though, that, I hate.

1447
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:25,979
I hate that. [laughs]

she came home a day early from her retreat

- High heels.
- Mm-hm.

1498
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,693
They're from a specialty drag queen store
called Scream Queens.

It's this great place,

1500
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,529
and they gave me a gift card,

1501
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:10,073
so if I come in, like, nine more times,
I get a free pair.

1502
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,034
They're, uh, beautiful.

1503
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,118

But I'm never gonna wear them.

Okay.

1506
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:19,374
Just keep 'em,

just in case.

1508
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,252
Why?

1509
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,756
I am glad you asked that, actually.
Let me paint you a picture.

1510
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,818
- Please don't...
- No, no, no, stick with me here.

1511
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,844
We're three years in the future.

1512
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:32,429
You are at some

1513
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:37,017
nice college in the Midwest,
Northwestern, maybe Notre Dame.

1514
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,059
And...

1515
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,228
you meet some...

1516
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:43,356
taller-than-you

1517
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:44,941
nice guy...

1518
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,696
and he really likes you because

1519
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,740
of how kind you are.

1520
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:56,286
And he likes how you sit up front
with your Uber drivers

1521
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,705
'cause you don't want them
to be lonely and...

1522
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:04,044
how you hate raisins but love Raisin Bran,

1523
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,545
which doesn't make any sense to me.

1524
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,547
But again, maybe he likes it.

1525
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,761
And he asks you out on a date.

1526
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:16,389
And you wanna wear your heels.

1527
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,643
And then you try and go out and buy some,

1528
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,270
and you can't get any
'cause there's a snowstorm outside.

1529
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:25,106
So you think back to this moment
and you go, "Damn.

1530
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:30,695
I should have kept those heels that
Dunkleman gave me just in case."

1531
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:44,042
It wouldn't work out with the guy.
It wouldn't. Yeah.

1532
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,461
- Right.
- But you'd look amazing, so...

1533
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:48,922
[chuckles]

1534
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,256
Thank you.

1535
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,468
Yeah, no problem.

<i>What were you and Jodi talking about
in the kitchen earlier?</i>

1542
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,858
<i>Seemed kind of important.</i>

1543
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,907
Uh, I... I messed with her.

1544
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:00,511
Yeah, Kimmy, I messed with her,
and... and she was pissed at me.

1545
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,495
- [Kimmy]<i> What'd you do?</i>
- [Stig] <i>Uh...</i>

1546
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,718
Okay, so she came over here the other day,

1547
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:07,435
and she was saying that the reason
that she left the escape room was

1548
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,961
because she couldn't stand to see me
with, uh, somebody else.

1549
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:14,007
So, basically just saying
that she's, uh, secretly in love with me.

1550
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,217
- [laughing]
- What?

1551
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,720
Confessing love?
Dude, that's, like, totally lame.

1552
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,555
Like, I'm definitely
not in love with Jodi.

1553
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:23,467
[Stig] <i>Right, so anyways,
I couldn't get her to leave,</i>

1554
01:24:23,516 --> 01:24:24,768
so just to get her off my back,

1555
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,611
I said, "Yeah,
I'll meet up with you tonight.

1556
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:29,814
We can talk more about it." But, uh...
But I... I totally stood her up.

Dunkers, what's your problem, man?

You are, man, you are.

1568
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,378
When I met you,
you were genuinely a super nice guy, man.

1569
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:53,963
But you've turned into such a jerk.

1570

<i>You're talking trash about Jodi
to all these people in public,</i>

1571

you're confessing your love for her to me.

1572
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,014
The crazy thing is you don't even
know a thing about her, man.

1573
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,350
What's her birthday, huh?
What's her middle name?

1574
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,633
What's her favorite color?
What color are her eyes, man?

1575
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:09,813
- Green.
- No, they're not, they're blue.

1576
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:14,275

She's the best person that I know.

And that's what's so funny,

1580
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:23,034

than her, but you're not.

than all of you guys combined.

1583
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,376

- Harper.

- Not mine. Okay.
- Not yours.

I'm so much more than just a tall girl.

1681
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,230
I'm a sister.

I'm smart.

I'm fun.

1687
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,080
And I've made mistakes.

1688
01:31:43,956 --> 01:31:46,876
I've kissed a guy who I knew
had a girlfriend.

1689
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:48,418
What?

1690
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:50,463
And I'm sorry.

1691
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:53,174
That was wrong.

1692
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,719
And I play piano,

1693
01:31:56,802 --> 01:31:59,430
and I'm... I'm really, really good at it.

1694
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:04,810
Being tall, actually, is what makes me,
me, and I... I like me.

1695
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,646
And you should like you.

1696

We're all good enough.

1697
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:12,318
And once we realize this,
no one can take it away.

1698
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,112
So go ahead and...
and keep making fun of me.

1699

Keep calling me names, keep asking me,
"How's the weather up there?" Because...

I can take it.

1701
