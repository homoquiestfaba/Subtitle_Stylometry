1
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,948
WOMAN: Um... Cheryl?

2
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,213
CHERYL: Almost done.
Just checking the connection.

3
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,824
You have people for that.

4
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,087
CHERYL: [SIGHS]
Ah, there you go.

5
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,135
You know I can't help it.

6
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,571
I'm hands-on.

7
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,231
Oh! Deputy Director!

8
00:00:58,232 --> 00:00:59,624
Merry Christmas, Senator!

9
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,886
Merry Christmas.

10
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:04,499
And this must be
- your granddaughter, Josie!
- Yes, it is.

11
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:06,066
Josie adores science.

12
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,068
Ah! You remind me of me.

13
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,591
You're an astronomer?

14
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,246
Well, I used to be.

15
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,943
How did you end up here?

16
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:15,336
Well, I'll tell you.

17
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,903
You see, I bumped into Cheryl
while I was visiting family

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,731
in Wellsboro a few years back.

19
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:23,474
And I read her
very impressive resume, and...

20
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:27,174
And here I am...
And here I go, I'm afraid.

21
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,307
Director Phillips,
maybe you would like
to show the Senator and Josie

22
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:32,483
the visitor's center?
And I'll sneak off
and finish my work,

23
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:33,832
- SENATOR: All right.
- Merry Christmas!

24
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,573
- JOSIE: Merry Christmas.
- SENATOR: Merry Christmas!

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,966
Yes, and I've never
seen him before.

26
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,402
Cheryl, where are you going?

27
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:42,058
I haven't finished
reviewing the grant proposals

28
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,365
and I need to finish it
by the end of the year.

29
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,801
But you'll miss the party!

30
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,542
Story of my life.

31
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:48,891
WOMAN: I'll meet you upstairs.

32
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,636
At least let me help
with the grant proposals.

33
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,421
You've already gone
above and beyond, Janice.

34
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,162
I can handle the rest.

35
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,730
I just wish
I didn't have to reject so many.

36
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,167
I can only play Santa once

37
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:06,865
for every 99 times
playing Scrooge!

38
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,129
Sounds like Christmas
couldn't come soon enough.

39
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,435
You still heading
to your parents' tonight?

40
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,655
If I can make my bus
in an hour.

41
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,310
Why not drive?
Wellsboro's not far.

42
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,487
But if I drive,
I can't review
next year's budget,

43
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,533
return Senator Mihara's
emails...I see your point.

44
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,277
[GASPS]

45
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,409
How about that...

46
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:31,847
My comet.

47
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,414
You have a comet?

48
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:34,893
Almost.

49
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,114
In grad school,
I was trying to prove

50
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,203
a comet exists
behind Pluto's orbit.

51
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,728
Looks like a team in Norway
just confirmed it.

52
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:44,990
Sorry.

53
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,428
But this might
lift your spirits.

54
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,213
What's this?

55
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:51,562
A Christmas present.

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,217
For someone
who's always short on time.

57
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,394
[GASPS]

58
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,745
Thank you.
Janice, you're the best.

59
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:22,506
Hey! Trish!

60
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,291
Merry Christmas!

61
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,770
Cheryl! Welcome home!

62
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,556
I didn't think you were
gonna be able to get away.

63
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,471
And miss a hometown Christmas?

64
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,037
Not a chance.

65
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,604
Has work lightened up at all?

66
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,868
It's more like a black hole.
Nothing escapes

67
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,566
its gravitational pull.

68
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,742
It's because it's so important.

69
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,700
You fund cutting-edge research!

70
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,790
Like that bio-fuel thing
you were telling me about
last year.

71
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,837
That has
major breakthrough potential,

72
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,839
it could lead
to sustainable energy!

73
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:54,016
Well, I am just happy
that you are here,

74
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,887
and Mom and Dad
can't wait to see you.

75
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,280
Me too.

76
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,414
Fold-out couch in the den,
here I come.

77
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,721
TRISH: They stored most of
the Christmas decorations,

78
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:04,983
so it won't be like old times.

79
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:06,898
What's this?

80
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:08,987
What's what?

81
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:10,728
"Trish's Bistro"?

82
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,469
I took the plunge.

83
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,297
I signed the lease yesterday.

84
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,647
I open my restaurant
in two weeks.

85
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,736
[GASPS]

86
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,564
Congratulations!

87
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,827
You have been talking
about that for years.

88
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,265
Are you sure you're ready?

89
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,746
Okay, go on.
You might as well say it.

90
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,661
I can tell you have
something on your mind.

91
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,407
It's just
opening a restaurant is risky.

92
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:38,800
And you've already
tried it once.

93
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,977
That was a snack shack,
and I learned a lot
from that experience!

94
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,588
Exactly, so why repeat it?

95
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,199
You're big-sistering me again.

96
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,463
[SIGHS] It's called
looking out for you.

97
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:52,379
Restaurants have
a lot of competition,

98
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,511
and a really slim margin,

99
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:57,079
and it's just...
it's such a big risk.

100
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,256
Well, my restaurant
has to succeed,

101
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,650
'cause I already bought
500 fondue forks!

102
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,652
So fingers crossed.

103
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,656
[LAUGHS]

104
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:14,575
CHERYL: I really miss it here.

105
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,275
In the city,
you can barely see any stars.

106
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,018
The Christmas Carnival
starts tonight, right?

107
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,629
Yep. Runs all five days
till Christmas.

108
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,370
You wanna check it out
after dinner?

109
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,068
Absolutely! I'm there.

110
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,680
And it brings back
such great memories.

111
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,511
CHERYL: Nothing changes here.

112
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,514
Hey, plenty changes.

113
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,734
For instance, we finally
finished the new city hall,

114
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,215
thanks to the youngest mayor
in town history.

115
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,609
Terrence finally
got what he wanted...

116
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:49,914
TRISH: Mm-hmm.

117
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:57,748
I still haven't gotten used to
the idea of someone else
living in their house,

118
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,881
but the new owners
are really nice.

119
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,491
You should meet them.

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,145
I'm sure they are.

121
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,322
I would just rather keep
my memories of our house
as it was.

122
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,759
Mom and Dad needed to downsize.

123
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,935
I know. Time moves on,

124
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,373
no matter what I have
to say about it.

125
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:20,510
They may have downsized,
but I see the snowman
did not get the memo.

126
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,255
Do not get in the way of Mom
and her Christmas decorations.

127
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,822
Okay.

128
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,084
[LAUGHING]

129
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,050
MOM: It's such a nice surprise.

130
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,096
We missed you so much.
Sweetheart,

131
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,402
we're so happy you're home.

132
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,230
Well, I couldn't miss
another Christmas

133
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:48,843
and by all the decorations,
neither could you!

134
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,149
These were just the ones
I could squeeze in.

135
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:54,022
Most of our lawn reindeer
are in storage

136
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,415
till we figure out
what to do with them.

137
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,462
Well, the best thing
about your new place

138
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:02,160
is it brings all of us
closer together.

139
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,773
I know it takes
some getting used to.

140
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,340
Like not seeing

141
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,299
Grandma's crystal angel
on top of the tree.

142
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,302
I miss that, too.

143
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,043
I put your luggage in the den.

144
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,655
Honey, are you sure
you don't mind sleeping
on the fold-out couch?

145
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,178
Of course not, Dad!

146
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:24,139
Okay, dinner will be ready
soon, guys.

147
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
Perfect.

148
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,622
Look what I found
going through boxes today.

149
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,799
Look, that's the year
that we went caroling
with the church choir.

150
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:35,716
Ms. Nelson.

151
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:40,242
That's the day
I won the Science Fair.

152
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:41,765
Remember?

153
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,638
It's hard to believe
she's been gone for five years.

154
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:47,989
I just wish I'd seen her more.

155
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,773
Well, you did
always make a point

156
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,079
to drop in on her
at Christmas.

157
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,473
Except for the last one.
I was too busy.

158
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,476
If only I'd known.

159
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,303
Oh, honey,

160
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,567
no one could have known
about her heart condition.

161
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,747
She was my inspiration.

162
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,881
And look who's is in that photo.
[LAUGHS]

163
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:14,406
Is that George Campbell
photobombing your victory shot?

164
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,278
CHERYL: Oh, that's George,
all right.

165
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:18,454
He got runner-up.

166
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,761
He never missed a chance
to try to outdo me.

167
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,937
Science fair, spelling bee,

168
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,765
student body selections,

169
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,550
George always had to prove
he was better.

170
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,204
DAD: Dinner's ready, guys!

171
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,119
And I hope you're hungry!

172
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,642
I am.

173
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:38,387
Just remember to save room
for dessert at the Carnival.

174
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,319
TRISH: 97 years,
and the Carnival's
still going strong.

175
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,190
CHERYL: I love the Carnival.

176
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,715
It's our own little snow globe,
frozen in time...

177
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,152

a white Christmas takes place
only here on Earth,

00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:39,642
And why's that?

716
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:41,470
He asked to borrow
my stapler once.

717
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,430
That it?

718
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,434
It was the way
he asked to borrow it.

719
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,000
Mm-hmm.

720
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,915
And what's so great
about Mr. Fletcher?

721
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:53,787
Well, for starters,

722
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,094
he's handsome, successful,

723
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,834
and well-mannered.

724
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:00,707
Well, if that's
the kind of thing you're into.

725
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:04,276
George,

726
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:05,886
I'll say this for you.

727
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,236
You always
could get me to laugh.

728
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:09,542
Hmm.

729
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,327
So can we focus
on the matters at hand?

730
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,807
Like science club?

731
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:15,983
Yes.

732
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:19,117
As a favor to Ms. Nelson,
I will allow you to assist me.

733
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,858
I'll text you
what we need to go over,

734
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,730
so you can share
your vast knowledge.

735
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,949
And then we'll see
who does it best.

736
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,561
So we're competing again, huh?

737
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,085
Just like old times.

738
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,175
Then game on.

739
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,667
Hey, perfect timing.
I just finished my shift.

740
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,756
I'm taking you to brunch,
remember?

741
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,672
So I heard you're doing
science club with George
this week?

742
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:55,065
Not by choice, I assure you.

743
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:56,589
I always thought
George was cute.

744
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,720
Like a puppy dog.

745
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,810
Yeah... the kind that barks
too much and eats your slippers.

746
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,857
But let's talk about
something happier.

747
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,642
Oh, my gosh.
That's him!

748
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:07,730
TRISH: That's who?

749
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,036
Dr. Phillips!

750
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,820
The guy Mom's friend
wants me to meet!

751
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,822
Well, for goodness sake,
let's say hi!

752
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,128
Dr. Phillips...CHERYL: Shh!

753
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,652
He doesn't know
what I look like,
so let's just keep it that way.

754
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,048
Shall we?

755
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,181
And here I was thinking
I was the crazy sister.

756
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:28,882
TRISH: Thanks again for brunch.

757
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,536
Now...

758
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,581
do you want to tell me
what's going on here?

759
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,670
I always know
when something is up with you,

760
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,803
and something is definitely up.

761
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:38,935
What?

762
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,720
We're here to enjoy ourselves.

763
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,983
Just some sisterly brunch.

764
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:44,811
Okay...

765
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:47,422
and why do I feel
some sisterly advice on the way?

766
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,729
Why would I be
giving you advice?

767
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,470
You are naturally gifted.

768
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:53,123
As a matter of fact,

769
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:55,735
you could thrive
if you tried something new.

770
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:57,998
Thanks, I agree.

771
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,653
The bakery is okay for now,

772
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,089
but the truth is

773
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,265
I'm thinking about opening up
a restaurant.

774
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,701
I've already started saving!

775
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,139
Yeah, about that...

776
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:10,837
What?

777
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,188
It's awesome
you're thinking ahead...

778
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,234
but the thing is...

779
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:23,110
most new restaurants fail
by the first year.

780
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,765
I just sent the links.

781
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,767
[PHONE ALERT CHIMES]
That was quick.

782
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:29,116
But...

783
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:31,249
I never told you
about my restaurant plans.

784
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:36,776
Chalk it up to us being
on the same sister wavelength.

785
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,300
Okay,

786
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:40,954
if you're looking
to change careers,

787
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,739
why not play to your strengths?

788
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:45,915
You're a people person
after all.

789
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,004
So what about a career

790
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:50,006
that leverages around
your circle of friends?

791
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,878
Like real estate
or insurance?

792
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,619
But, Cheryl...

793
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,361
Just promise me you'll take
a look at the links?

794
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:58,798
I have to get back
to science club.

795
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,409
See you later.

796
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:05,631
Ho, ho, ho.

797
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,853
So as the temperature decreases,

798
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,638
the sugar comes
out of the solution,

799
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,030
and that's
how crystals are formed...

800
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,205
or better yet...

801
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:19,601
red and green rock candy!

802
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,082
- Now, who wants some candy?
- STUDENTS: Yeah!

803
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,998
All right.
Pass these around.

804
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,133
Top that.

805
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:32,788
Moving on,

806
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:36,052
I'll be explaining electrons.

807
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,099
Christmas lights
work by a simple idea.

808
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,929
Particles called "electrons"
travel through a wire,

809
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:45,714
causing the filaments
in the lights to glow.

810
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:48,674
What's a "filament"?

811
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,110
CHERYL: A filament

812
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:54,636
is a conducting wire
with a high melting point,

813
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,638
which conveys electrons

814
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,553
via thermionic emissions.

815
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,427
It's simple, really.

816
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,907
Let me show you the equation.

817
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,215
The Bohr model

818
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:11,261

MS. NELSON: Cheryl!

821
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:26,276
So, tell me,
how did science club go today?

822
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:27,539
Honestly?

823
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:29,454
Kind of a trainwreck.

824
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,891
Well, you want to come in
and tell me all about it?

825
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,545
Over a glass of Merlot?

826
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:34,894
Yes.

827
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:36,374
And Santa-size it, please?

828
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:38,680
Step into my lab.

829
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:46,079
So things didn't work out
so good with science club, huh?

830
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,473
I don't know how you do it.

831
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:50,562
The secret to teaching...

832
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,086
is making it fun.

833
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,610
Easier said than done.

834
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,526
Oh, well, it's not as difficult
as you might think.

835
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:00,615
For example...

836
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:05,228
instead of me giving you
a long chemistry lecture,

837
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,666
what if I asked you...

838
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,755
to make cookies?

839
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:13,541
Every recipe
is a chemical formula.

840
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,238
You've got the sugar

841
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,502
bonding to the gluten
in the flour.

842
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,722
There's the chocolate
and the vanilla

843
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:25,292
mixing together when you add
just the right amount of heat.

844

00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:29,949
Hmm.

all the time.

on the competition, I guess.

854
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:56,410

I really hope the two of you
are enjoying working together,

00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:01,067

a quick errand to run.

a Christmas tree and...

to drop it off, right?

to any of the students today?

"thermionic emissions" part.

from delivering that lecture?

I know
you still don't believe me,

00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,392
but isn't the foundation
of science

891
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,785
to have an open mind?

892
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:53,527
Science is about proof.

If I remember right,

895
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,447
this week, a freak snowfall

896
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,972
closed a main road
between here and Willoughby.

897
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,149
This week's forecast

898
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,065
is nothing but
clear, sunny skies.

899
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:13,199
We'll see.

900
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:15,636
CHERYL: This one's
pretty nice.

901
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,204
That's a way better tree
over there.

902
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,510
-[sighs] You're doing it again.
- GEORGE: Huh?

903
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,295
Every single time
I do something,

904
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:24,079
you always have to try
to outdo me.

905
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:25,254
No, that's all in your head.

906
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:28,127
The academic decathlon,

907
00:43:28,214 --> 00:43:29,563
the 4-H competition.

908
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:31,086
Oh, I could go on...

909
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,435
You remember all of that?

910
00:43:33,262 --> 00:43:35,613
That's just proof
that you've been jealous of me
ever since back in high school.

911
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:37,266
What?

912
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:39,442
You've always been
jealous of me!

913
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:41,053
Please.

914
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:42,968
I love my life.

915
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:44,839
Do you?

916
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,364
Okay, fine. I admit it.

917
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:49,975
My life is far from perfect.

918
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,066
But this week,
I have a second chance.

919
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:56,634
And I'm gonna make a difference.

920
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:00,899
Starting with getting
Ms. Nelson that tree...

921
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,422
- GEORGE: Oh, watch out!
- Oh!

922
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:06,731
Ah!

923
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,297
I'd say...

924
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:09,908
the weather has changed.

925
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,126
Well, that's hardly proof.

926
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:13,389
Time will tell.

927
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:20,832
Thank you.

928
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:23,312
All right, follow me.

929
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:28,622
We're having science club
at the carnival?

930
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:30,537
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

931
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,499
Watch and learn.

932
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:41,679
A carnival is a perfect example
of science in action.

933
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:44,856
The centrifugal force
of the Ferris wheel,

934
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:46,335
and over here...

935
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,033
the Berry-Go-Round

936
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,165
may seem just like
a carnival ride,

937
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,429
but it illustrates
Newton's laws in action...

938
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:56,998
A berry in motion
stays in motion

939
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:59,740
unless acted on
by an external force.

940
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:00,915
Now,

941
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:03,526
give me an example
of the third law.

942
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:06,616
Like in football,
For every action,

943
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:09,532
there's an equal
and opposite reaction?

944
00:45:09,837 --> 00:45:13,754
Maybe when two players collide,
the ball flies loose?

945
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,061
You've got it!

946
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:18,628
Okay, notepads out.

947
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,892
I want all of you
to write down

948
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:23,895
every kind of motion
you see around you!

949
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:27,159
Okay? Go for it!

950
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,206
Phew!

951
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:34,253
Seems like somebody's improved
her teaching skills a bit.

952
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,300
Why do your compliments always
sound like you're teasing?

953
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:40,738
Maybe you just
hear it that way.

954
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,001
Well then, thank you.

955
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,308
Maybe I just wish
I was in their shoes,

956
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:50,356
being a student again and having
time to gaze up at the stars.

957
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,273
I guess somehow I lost my way.

958
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:58,146
GEORGE: So how goes your mission
to change the future?

959
00:45:58,451 --> 00:46:00,061
And yes, I'm humoring you.

960
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:02,150
Fine then, I'll play along.

961
00:46:02,672 --> 00:46:04,674
The future's looking up,
thank you.

962
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:09,070
I've been inspiring
my sister with career ideas,

963
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,769
and I have my big date
with Terrence tonight.

964
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:14,597
And how about me,
how's my future look?

965
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:19,602
Oh, I think it's safe to say
you haven't changed a bit.

966
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:22,780
I don't know if that's
a compliment or an insult.

967
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,259
Maybe a little bit of both.

968
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:28,133
You know, I always felt like
our competition brought out
the best in each other.

969
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,266
- Seriously?
- Yeah. I love
competing against you.

970
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:33,486
Why? It was exhausting!

971
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,010
Maybe I needed
a kick in the pants.

972
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:38,708
When I was in first year
of high school,

973
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,058
I was barely getting
passing grades.

974
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,929
Then they stuck us
in a class together,

975
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,409
we were off to the races.

976
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:47,282
But of all people,
why choose me to compete with?

977
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:49,023
Because you were the best.

978
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:51,721
Really?

979
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,419
Don't let it go to your head.

980
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:57,118
How about we settle
this lifetime of competition

981
00:46:57,336 --> 00:46:58,424
once and for all?

982
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,339
And how do you suggest
we do that?

983
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:05,735
[LAUGHS] Okay.

984
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:08,782
Two, please?

985
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:12,830
You first.

986
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:15,484
All right, you asked for it.

987
00:47:19,097 --> 00:47:20,054
Ooh.

988
00:47:23,188 --> 00:47:24,406
Yes!

989
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:27,714
- All right.
- That one, please.

990
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:33,763
Just to show no hard feelings,
I'll share my prize.

991
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:37,463
Cheryl Jenkins,
you are generous to a fault.

992
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,596
Excuse me. Cheryl Jenkins?

993
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,772
I've been leaving you messages.

994
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:44,600
I'm Dr. Phillips!

995
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:47,255
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my niece, Emma.

996
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,127
She's been giving me
the grand tour of your carnival.

997
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,477
I'm so sorry.
I've just been busy.

998
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,131
Uh...

999
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:54,436
this is George.

1000
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:56,351
- Nice to meet you, doc.
- DR. PHILLIPS: And you.

1001
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,484
Well, Cheryl, you know,
I was starting to think

1002
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,703
that you and I were destined
to keep missing one another.

1003
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,967
You know, I've heard
some wonderful things about you.

1004
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:05,839
I'd really appreciate it
if we could sit down
sometime soon and talk.

1005
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:07,493
Oh, really?

1006
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,191
I'll tell you what, how's
tomorrow at Holly's Cafe?
Say 10:00 a.m.?

1007
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,324
I wish I could, but

1008
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,065
I'm lending a hand
at the junior high and...

1009
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:15,283
No, no, no.
That's okay.

1010
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:17,851
We can spare the time if you
guys need to grab a coffee.

1011
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:20,027
Perfect.
Well then, until tomorrow.

1012
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:22,377
- See you then.
- You bet.

1013
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:29,297
What... what did I do?

1014
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:31,909
It's okay,
you were just trying to help.

1015
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:34,912
I'd better head out.

1016
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:36,870
For your dream date
with Terrence?

1017
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:39,699
Have fun.

1018
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,223
Yeah, I'll hold down the fort.

1019
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,535
Here, try this one on.

1020
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:54,670
Thanks, sis.
- That's gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

1021
00:48:55,323 --> 00:48:56,672
Wow. Thanks.

1022
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:00,372
You know, I'm impressed.

1023
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:01,764
Only in town a few days

1024
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,463
and you've already got
dates and a job interview.

1025
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:05,855
Not bad.

1026
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:07,988
How did you know
I have an interview?

1027
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,426
Mom says you have a meeting
with that science guy

1028
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:13,515
about a job.[SIGHS]

1029
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:14,647
We'll see about that.

1030
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,867
Did you see the snowman
I built out front?

1031
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,827
You mean the one
holding brochures

1032
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,437
for a real estate workshop?

1033
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:25,223
CHERYL: It's the season
of giving!

1034
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:28,922
Just promise me
you'll give it some thought.

1035
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:31,229
Fine.

1036
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:35,320
You look great.

1037
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,278
All ready for your big date?

1038
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:38,714
You bet.

1039
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,586
I'm not leaving
anything to chance.

1040
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:43,458
This time when destiny calls,

1041
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:46,244
I am not letting it
go to voicemail!

1042
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:47,897
Okay.

1043
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,551
[LAUGHING]

1044
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:55,383
You look fantastic.

1045
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:57,081
And this place is great...

1046
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,692
Yes, the chef here's amazing.

1047
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:01,476
People wait months
for a reservation here.

1048
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:03,826
Didn't they just open
last week?

1049
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:06,351
I just meant...

1050
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:10,094
I sense good things
for this place.

1051
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,966
Well, it does seem like
the perfect choice for tonight.

1052
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,751
And it's got a no-slip floor,

1053
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:17,231
so, less chance of falls.

1054
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:18,841
No open flame.

1055
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,583
And no nuts on the menu.
So, it is risk-free.

1056
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,065
I... uh...

1057
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,241
- called ahead?
- Oh.

1058
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,505
A bottle of your best
unoaked Chardonnay, please.

1059
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,594
- Right away.
- You do like Chardonnay, right?

1060
00:50:32,899 --> 00:50:34,031
Sure. That's fine.

1061
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,469
CHERYL: [SIGHS]
It's so funny,

1062
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,124
us, together.

1063
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:43,301
I feel like

1064
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,781
we never got a chance
to talk back in high school.

1065
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:49,220
Well, I always wanted
to talk to you,

1066
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:51,178
but you were always off,
hiding in the lab!

1067
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:53,485
Guilty as charged.

1068
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,358
And anyways, you were always
off with your buddies.

1069
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,794

00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,223

all of my holiday shopping."

He never said
- anything of the sort.
- What, were you there?

1245
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:58,143
No, don't answer that.
You probably were.

1246
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:00,841
Speaking of which,

1247
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:03,801
how's your mission
to change the future going?

1248
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,326
About as smoothly
as the Big Bang.

1249
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:08,849
I just...

1250
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:12,026
I thought Trish always wanted
my advice,

1251
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,551
and it turns out
she doesn't at all.

1252
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:17,554
The more I try to help her,
the more she pulls away!

1253
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:19,686
Not so easy, huh?

1254
00:59:21,514 --> 00:59:22,733
That's putting it mildly.

1255
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:27,172
Trish is upset, my date
with Terrence went south,

1256
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:29,740
and now Dr. Phillips

1257
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,611
wants to sweeten an offer

1258
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:33,570
for a job
that I don't even want!

1259
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,444
I thought I could change things.

1260
00:59:39,924 --> 00:59:41,403
It seems like I'm fighting fate.

1261
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:44,755
I...

1262
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:46,670
I guess I have to try harder.

1263
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:49,150
Or you could stop trying.

1264
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,153
But if you can change
the future,

1265
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,372
wouldn't you try?

1266
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:55,374
The way I see it...

1267
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,376
why fight fate?

1268
00:59:57,898 --> 00:59:59,204
Whatever's gonna happen
is gonna happen.

1269
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,684

can use my help today.

Let's get this wrapped.

1279
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:37,895
You know, you have a kind side

1280
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:40,419
that I never
fully appreciated before.

1281
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:43,509
Well, that's probably because we
were always trying to outdo
each other.

You've always been
one-of-a-kind.

I remember in school,
when I was struggling,

1284
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,912
and I saw this curious dynamo
with a pink backpack...

1285
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:57,131
you lived and breathed learning,

1286
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:58,393
and I...

1287
01:00:59,003 --> 01:01:00,482
that made me feel
like I could, too.

Yeah.

Or maybe I just missed you.

1292

a confession to make.

Okay.

01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:12,811
What is it about winter nights

1408
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:15,814
that make the stars so clear?

1409
01:07:17,816 --> 01:07:19,948
Cold air doesn't hold
as much moisture,

1410
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,994
so there's less interference.

1411
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:24,127
Right.

1412
01:07:24,562 --> 01:07:26,781
I almost forgot I was speaking
to an actual astronomer.

1413
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:31,308
You know, I went into science

1414
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:33,484
because I loved
looking at the stars

1415
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:37,227
but seeing the students
so excited this week it...

1416
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,317
