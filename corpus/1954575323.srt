1
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:44,553
<i>This is more retarded than when I got</i>
<i>that gumball stuck up my nose</i>.

2
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:48,681
<i>Or the time I wanted to be</i>
<i>the first white Harlem Globetrotter</i>.

3
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:53,154
<i>And it's more embarrassing</i>
<i>than the time</i>...

4
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:57,062
...<i>my mom walked in on me while I was</i>
<i>trying to simulate vaginal friction</i>...

5
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:59,999
...<i>by rubbing my boner between</i>
<i>the mattress and box springs</i>.

6
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:01,900
Why don't you go out and play.

7
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:03,904
lt's such a beautiful day.

8
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:06,873
<i>No, this tops it</i>.

9
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:09,342
<i>And it's all because of Erica</i>.

10
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:15,246
<i>Erica</i>.

11
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,746
<i>It sounds so much like ''erotica. ''</i>

12
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:21,919
<i>And it's fitting:</i>

13
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:24,152
<i>She's a walking wet dream</i>.

14
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,633
<i>The kind of girl</i>
<i>whose mere glance at you</i>...

15
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:33,929
...<i>could get your pecker</i>
<i>to stand up and say, ''Howdy. ''</i>

16
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:36,505
<i>And not your normal,</i>
<i>run-of-the-mill erection</i>.

17
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:39,507
<i>We're talking the kind</i>
<i>that could be picked up on radar</i>.

18
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,672
<i>The kind you could hang a flag from</i>.

19
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,055
<i>And her breasts</i>.

20
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:54,191
<i>They must have tractor beams in them</i>.

21
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:57,725
<i>They pull my hands toward them</i>
<i>like the Death Star</i>...

22
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:59,419
...<i>dragging in the</i> Millennium Falcon.

23
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,138
Come on, guys.

24
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:27,251
lf l had breasts like that,
l could have ruled the world.

25
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:32,560
You are in love with her, no?

26
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:35,657
No, l'm not.

27
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,563
Then why are you sitting so funny?

28
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:41,232
Nonno.

29
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:44,064
Don't be ashamed.

30
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,300
A man is two people:

31
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,638
Himself and his penis.

32
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:51,441
A man always takes his friend
to the party...

33
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:54,312
...but of the two,
the friend is nicer...

34
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:58,046
...because he is more able
to show his feelings.

35
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:03,626
Does this Erica know
what you think about her?

36
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,655
She's got a boyfriend.

37
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,390
They are not lovers?

38
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,600
-l don't think so.
-That is good.

39
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,500
one pubic hair
between a man and a woman...

40
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:18,608
...can be stronger
than the Atlantic cable.

41
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,368
You're telling me.

42
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:22,478
What is your problem with the <i>bella</i>?

43
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:26,811
She goes off to college on the East Coast
in three months.

44
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:29,544
Then you must declare
your love to her immediately.

45
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,218
-Are you crazy?
-You must.

46
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,789
-lt is the only way.
-oh, no, no, no.

47
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,859
She'll think l'm a spaz.

48
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:40,691
Then you prefer to sit funny
the rest of your life?

49
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:44,562
Now, listen, <i>ragazzo,</i>
l will tell you a story.

50
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,829
lt is about your great-great-grandfather...

51
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,269
...<i>Giuseppe Luigi Bendini</i>.

52
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,434
<i>When he was a boy your age,</i>
<i>he was in love</i>...

53
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:58,275
...<i>with the most beautiful girl</i>
<i>in the village of Cascata</i>.

54
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,318
<i>But the</i> bella...

55
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:03,715
...<i>she did not see anything</i>
<i>in Giuseppe</i>.

56
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:08,325
<i>So one day, Giuseppe,</i>
<i>an enterprising young boy</i>...

57
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:10,357
...<i>declared his love to her</i>.

58
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,185
<i>He said:</i>

59
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:15,992
<i>''I, Giuseppe Luigi Bendini,</i>
<i>love you</i>...

60
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:19,193
...<i>and to prove that I will</i>
<i>always be there for you</i>...

61
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,002
...<i>I will stand under your balcony</i>
<i>day and night without relent</i>...

62
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:28,009
...<i>until you fall in love with me. ''</i>

63
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,342
So Giuseppe...

64
00:04:34,518 --> 00:04:38,887
...<i>stood outside that balcony</i>
<i>day and night</i>.

65
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,115
<i>Night and day</i>.

66
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:46,821
<i>Until, finally, his love came</i>
<i>out to the balcony and cried:</i>

67
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:51,297
<i>''Giuseppe Luigi Bendini, I love you!''</i>

68
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:52,663
<i>So Giuseppe</i>...

69
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:55,897
...climbed up to the balcony
and into her bed.

70
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:59,304
<i>They made love so passionately</i>...

71
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:02,674
...that the ground shook.

72
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,338
And villagers today still believe...

73
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:09,452
...that's what caused
the 1 874 earthquake.

74
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,013
l can't do that.

75
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:15,988
<i>You can, my friend</i>.

76
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:19,555
Women are like breaking into a bank.

77
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,129
lt takes nerve.

78
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,959
lt takes daring.

79
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:27,833
Sometimes you need a little bit
of dynamite to blow the vault.

80
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:32,871
<i>I don't know what it was</i>.

81
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:37,707
<i>Maybe all the benzoyl peroxide</i>
<i>in my zit cream had affected my brain</i>.

82
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:42,512
<i>Or maybe I had a strange fetish</i>
<i>for humiliation at the hands of a woman</i>.

83
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:45,416
<i>I figured this stemmed</i>
<i>from watching too many episodes</i>...

84
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:50,253
...<i>of Julie Newmar as the Catwoman</i>
<i>in all those</i> Batman <i>reruns</i>.

85
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,588
<i>But it seemed like an audacious idea</i>.

86
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,924
<i>I decided to try it</i>.

87
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,933
Peter, that is so sweet.

88
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:00,002
<i>I was beginning to think</i>
<i>this might work</i>...

89
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,196
...<i>when she said</i>
<i>the most dreaded two words</i>...

90
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:03,738
...<i>in the English language</i>.

91
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:06,376
But, Peter, we're just friends.

92
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,011
<i>''Just friends. ''</i>

93
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:11,637
<i>The words hit me like screaming lead</i>
<i>shot from a</i> .<i>38</i>.

94
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,750
l wanna be...

95
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,783
...just friends.

96
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:25,589
lt's just a flesh wound, my friend.

97
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,287
lt will not kill you.

98
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:29,557
Get back up and fight.

99
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:36,296
l'm not gonna give up so easily.

100
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:38,236
But, Peter--

101
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,743
<i>I was rudely interrupted</i>
<i>by Erica's boyfriend, Nick</i>.

102
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:51,014
<i>He's what I call a ''gaping asshole. ''</i>

103
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:58,552
<i>You know, the type of guy that's</i>
<i>going to college on a football scholarship</i>.

104
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,926
<i>But what bothers me most</i>
<i>is he's one of those macho dicks</i>...

105
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,660
...<i>who's always grabbing his crotch</i>
<i>and adjusting his balls</i>.

106
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:08,168
<i>I mean, what's the deal?</i>

107
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:10,739
<i>He acts like he's a guard</i>
<i>at the Tower of London</i>.

108
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:16,608
<i>He's gotta check every 1 0 seconds</i>
<i>to see if the crown jewels are still there</i>.

109
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:24,648
<i>And how come every asshole I know</i>
<i>has to make that noise?</i>

110
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:31,119
<i>You can hear a symphony of those</i>
<i>in any boys' locker room</i>.

111
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,990
<i>Is it like a lion roaring?</i>

112
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:35,290
<i>The asshole who can hawk</i>
<i>a loogie the loudest</i>...

113
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,730
...<i>is the leader of the herd?</i>

114
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:41,065
<i>Needless to say, Nick has been</i>
<i>my nemesis since I was 5</i>.

115
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:48,701
-l forbid you to go out dressed like that.
-Dad.

116
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,337
No self-respecting Christian girl
would be seen in public in a--

117
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:55,679
Just get in the house.
Get in the house.

118
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:01,987
Erica. Erica. Erica!

119
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,760
<i>Erica looked more doable than</i>
<i>Barbara Feldon in</i> Get Smart.

120
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,195
Erica! Get your--

121
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,859
<i>She kissed Nick so hard, I'm sure they</i>
<i>could've swallowed each others uvulas</i>.

122
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,699
Erica, if you--

123
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,733
What the hell's his story?

124
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:25,405
<i>She then proceeded to tell Nick</i>
<i>what I was up to</i>.

125
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:42,464
<i>And if things weren't hard enough,</i>
<i>I encountered more unexpected problems</i>.

126
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,498
Well, our prayers
have been answered.

127
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:47,228
l have been asking God
to send someone to take her away...

128
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,395
...from that heathen boyfriend, Nick.

129
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,767
-You're a miracle.
-Yes.

130
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:52,875
<i>Erica's dad can never</i>
<i>have a conversation</i>...

131
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:57,537
...<i>without quoting some guy named</i>
<i>Zig Ziglar, a Christian motivational speaker</i>.

132
00:08:57,715 --> 00:09:00,912
<i>Frankly, I'd never be caught dead</i>
<i>quoting some guy named Zig</i>.

133
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:05,112
The difference between you
and that barbarian, Nick, is that you--

134
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,586
Remember what he said.

135
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:11,717
--have a ''swelled heart,
not a swelled head.''

136
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:15,763
<i>I wanted to tell him that his daughter</i>
<i>gave me both. But I didn't</i>.

137
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,896
Peter, l thought you might be hungry...

138
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:20,559
...so l brought cookies
l made for the church bake sale.

139
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,968
<i>I wasn't all that surprised</i>
<i>by the cookies</i>.

140
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,803
<i>This is the same woman who encourages</i>
<i>her youngest daughter, Mary</i>...

141
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:28,501
...<i>to play with nun dolls</i>.

142
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,409
''Now say 50 more.''
''Hail Mary, Hail Mary...

143
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:33,311
...Hail Mary, Hail Mary, Hail Mary....''

144
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:36,709
-Thanks.
-Yes, yes, yes.

145
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:38,149
<i>Now let's face it</i>.

146
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,916
<i>It's a proven fact that girls</i>
<i>do not fall in love</i>...

147
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:43,491
...<i>with any boy her parents</i>
<i>actually like</i>.

148
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,594
<i>I vowed at that very moment</i>
<i>that I would</i>...

149
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:47,890
...<i>find a way to make her parents</i>
<i>hate me</i>.

150
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,930
<i>I set Giuseppe to work on it</i>.

151
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:55,233
Go ahead, Peter, try it.

152
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:17,691
<i>My dad's reaction to my plan,</i>
<i>when he heard about it from Mom</i>...

153
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:19,988
...<i>registered on the Richter scale</i>
<i>at Caltech</i>.

154
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,029
Peter. Peter!

155
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,861
Stop acting like you don't hear me. Peter.

156
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:30,740
Hell's bells.
You get inside right this instant.

157
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:33,274
-l'm not leaving this spot.
-Yes, you are.

158
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:35,207
-No, l'm not.
-Yes, you are.

159
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,904
You stop listening
to your grandfather's nonsense.

160
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,845
He's not all there. Now, come on.

161
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:42,952
-Let go. l'm not hurting anyone.
-You are acting like a fool.

162
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,417
-Now, come on.
-No.

163
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:46,078
-Give it up, son.
-Mom!

164
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:48,417
-Listen to your father.
-This is ridiculous.

165
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,254
What will the neighbors think?
Some of them are my patients.

166
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:54,124
They'll stop coming to me
if they think my son's a pervert...

167
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:55,925
...who stands under girls' windows.

168
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,898
-You're just embarrassing our entire family.
-Dad!

169
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:00,593
-l'm sorry.
-Now, let go, Peter.

170
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,700
My New Guinea impatiens!

171
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:07,976
-l'm sorry.
-What are you doing?

172
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,612
<i>Good old Nonno</i>.

173
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,372
<i>Whenever a situation calls for it</i>...

174
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,880
...<i>my grandfather pulls</i>
<i>his ''infirm old man '' routine</i>.

175
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:15,177
l'm sorry.

176
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:18,185
<i>He's saved my life hundreds of times</i>.

177
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:20,051
l'm sorry.

178
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:24,022
<i>The same couldn't be said</i>
<i>for my best friend, Matt</i>.

179
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,627
This is my last chance.

180
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:29,129
Look, you know, l just don't wanna
see you setting yourself up like this.

181
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:31,699
l have been in love with Erica
since we were kids.

182
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,167
We used to play
Cowboys and lndians together.

183
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:37,535
When we were little,
we used to do everything together.

184
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,337
When you get mad at someone,
you go like this:

185
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,774
-lt was great.
-lt'll never work.

186
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,378
Why not?

187
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:48,950
Because we're losers.

188
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,088
Look, we've been picked
by genetic selection...

189
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:56,215
...to be the world's biggest living proof
that this world is fucked.

190
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,920
-How's that?
-We lost the DNA lottery.

191
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,122
We didn't get the asshole gene.

192
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,199
See, we're the nice guys.

193
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:05,801
We're never gonna succeed.

194
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:08,802
only the assholes get the girls
and the dough, bro.

195
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:12,236
-You've got it all figured out.
-Damn straight, l do.

196
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,775
My parents think l'm going
to college in the fall.

197
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:17,812
l'm not going to college so l can be
a jerk with a degree...

198
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,881
...who assistant-manages
a Burger King.

199
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,450
''Would you like fries with that, please?''
No way.

200
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,951
-So you're just gonna give up?
-Yep.

201
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:27,955
-And l suppose you want me to give up too?
-Exactly.

202
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,959
You gotta become comfortably numb.

203
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:35,189
You can't let anyone
or anything disappoint you.

204
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,196
You gotta be self-sufficient.

205
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:41,804
l mean, look at me.
Do l need a girl like Erica? No.

206
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:46,372
Since you're gonna be here all summer,
mind if l use your mailing address?

207
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,408
-What for?
-l sent away for something...

208
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,877
...and l don't want my mom
to accidentally open it.

209
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:54,506
So l figured you'll be out here,
you can intercept it before anyone gets it.

210
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:56,613
-okay, l guess.
-Yes.

211
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,484
Hey. But admit it...

212
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:01,886
...sometimes you wish
you had a girlfriend.

213
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,390
No way.

214
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,255
Blockbuster, Domino's Pizza...

215
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:07,329
...Rosy Palm and her five friends...

216
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:10,364
...are all l need
for a great Saturday night.

217
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,201
Maybe if you're 1 4.

218
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,428
okay, you do have a point.

219
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:19,201
Sometimes l do need to spice up
my love life a little bit.

220
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:23,071
l'd like you to meet
my date for the evening, Peter.

221
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,346
You know, l read in <i>Barely Legal</i>
magazine about this guy...

222
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,544
...he got off humping fruit.

223
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:33,280
You're a sick puppy.

224
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:37,258
The sun is gonna make it
nice and warm.

225
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:39,054
Just like the real thing.

226
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:40,862
Well, what about the seeds?

227
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:44,025
Come on. l'm not gonna go down on it.

228
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:53,438
<i>I amused myself</i>
<i>by watching the neighborhood</i>.

229
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,601
<i>Life is my TV</i>.

230
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,680
<i>And it was a little more interesting</i>
<i>than network television</i>.

231
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:00,111
<i>There was Mr. Mays</i>.

232
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:03,447
<i>My parents think he works</i>
<i>for the CIA or the FBI</i>.

233
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,383
<i>It's because every time</i>
<i>he comes home</i>...

234
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,682
...<i>he drives around the block</i>
<i>again and again</i>...

235
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,792
...<i>to make sure he's not being followed</i>.

236
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,293
<i>There's a kid on the street</i>
<i>that's a pyromaniac</i>.

237
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,598
<i>Matt made sure his parents</i>
<i>had left him alone in the house</i>.

238
00:14:23,974 --> 00:14:25,771
Bye, guys.

239
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,804
<i>He then went to the upstairs bathroom</i>
<i>to make</i> amore <i>with his watermelon</i>.

240
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,873
<i>And the guy across the street</i>.

241
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>I forget his name</i>.

242
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,246
<i>But he seems so sad</i>.

243
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:38,979
<i>His wife has cancer</i>.

244
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:43,525
<i>He dutifully takes her out</i>
<i>for a breath of fresh air every day</i>.

245
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:45,958
<i>It's a good thing Erica isn't around</i>.

246
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,621
<i>I got a woody watching Ms. Lewis</i>
<i>work out to</i> Buns of Steel.

247
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,768
And pull. And pull. And pull.

248
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:54,460
<i>Mr. Mays put in a second lap</i>.

249
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:03,473
<i>The crazy lady next door</i>
<i>eats her dinner in the car</i>.

250
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:07,208
<i>I was dismayed to see history</i>
<i>repeating itself</i>.

251
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,783
<i>Maybe Matt is right</i>.

252
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:10,943
<i>Some people are born</i>
<i>with the asshole gene</i>...

253
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,146
...<i>and some of us aren't</i>.

254
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,493
<i>There was nothing much happening</i>
<i>to keep me amused at night</i>.

255
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:24,464
<i>At about 1 0, I saw Matt go out</i>
<i>to the upstairs balcony</i>.

256
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,431
<i>If he had been in there all that time</i>...

257
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:29,595
...<i>that watermelon now had</i>
<i>more holes in it than a Wiffle ball</i>.

258
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:32,298
<i>Only the crazy lady was out</i>.

259
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:34,535
<i>She was cutting her grass</i>.

260
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:42,108
<i>It looked like there was something good</i>
<i>on TV over at my house</i>...

261
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,480
...<i>and I wanted to watch it</i>.

262
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:47,623
<i>But something got in the way</i>.

263
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,519
<i>So I watered the plants instead</i>.

264
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,467
<i>I figured I should take advantage</i>
<i>of the time I had on my hands</i>.

265
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,967
<i>I vowed that if I were</i>
<i>to become Erica's boyfriend</i>...

266
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:04,505
...<i>I had to become the greatest lover</i>
<i>she had ever known</i>.

267
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:09,774
<i>In pursuit of that goal, I decided</i>
<i>I would become an expert in love</i>.

268
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:12,838
<i>I started by reading</i> The Joy of Sexuality.

269
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:17,143
<i>It wasn't the descriptions of the wildly</i>
<i>uninhibited Chinese-style sex positions</i>...

270
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,811
...<i>like the</i>
<i>''wailing monkey clasping a tree''</i>...

271
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,424
...<i>or ''wild geese flying on their backs ''</i>...

272
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:24,492
...<i>that I found most enlightening</i>.

273
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:27,425
<i>It was the guy they picked</i>
<i>to illustrate</i>...

274
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:29,428
...<i>all the exotic conjugations</i>.

275
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,466
<i>The guy is butt-ugly</i>.

276
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:34,163
<i>And the girl was a babe</i>.

277
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,102
<i>This was inspiring</i>.

278
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:40,642
<i>I mean, if this</i> Quest for Fire <i>reject</i>
<i>could get laid, why couldn't I?</i>

279
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:07,062
oh, good, my parents aren't home
from church yet.

280
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,772
l'll meet you inside.

281
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,034
l'm gonna have a talk
with your friend Peter.

282
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,541
okay.

283
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:34,222
So you're still here, huh?

284
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:38,258
l would have thought you'd have
gotten smart and given up by now.

285
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:42,434
Why do guys always make that noise?

286
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:43,834
What noise?

287
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:45,474
This noise:

288
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:51,680
l mean, you guys spit so much.

289
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:53,839
Makes you wonder
what you've been sucking on.

290
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,484
Shut up.

291
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,481
oh, what a--

292
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:03,683
What a demonstrative display
of masculine aggression.

293
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,920
Did you know
that such behavior is a sign of...

294
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,796
...latent homosexuality?

295
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:15,367
l think it's time you left.

296
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:23,210
-l'm not leaving.
-You wanna fight?

297
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:24,941
l'll give you a free shot.

298
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:28,178
Go for it, my friend.

299
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,444
<i>How could I refuse this invitation?</i>

300
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,110
<i>I was going to lose this fight</i>...

301
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:35,056
...<i>but at least I could get</i>
<i>one killer shot in</i>.

302
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,318
<i>So I charged the Prince of Darkness</i>.

303
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,959
<i>Then I realized my mistake</i>.

304
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,427
<i>It was a trick</i>.

305
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,566
<i>It felt like my nuts had exploded</i>.

306
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:47,066
<i>And it sounded like a pair of water balloons</i>
<i>dropped off a building</i>.

307
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,344
That'll teach you, huh?

308
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:12,390
<i>I took it as a good sign that Erica</i>
<i>was curious to see if I was still there</i>.

309
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:26,274
<i>It was important that Erica never see me</i>
<i>flag in my devotion by leaving my post</i>.

310
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:29,412
<i>But on the other hand, I didn't</i>
<i>wanna smell like my uncle Lou</i>...

311
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,639
...<i>when Erica finally buckled</i>
<i>under my romantic vigilance</i>.

312
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:35,944
<i>So I figured while she was</i>
<i>getting ready for the day</i>...

313
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,555
...<i>I'd pop inside for a quick shower</i>
<i>and some Cheerios</i>.

314
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:41,156
What are you doing?

315
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,189
Changing the locks.

316
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,193
When you finally give up
this nonsense...

317
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,627
...l'll let you back inside.

318
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:51,093
Dad, give me a break.

319
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:52,928
Forget it.

320
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:01,239
Mom.

321
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,309
<i>This was desperate</i>.

322
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,209
<i>No food. No water</i>.

323
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:06,508
Nice.

324
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,618
<i>And I really needed to do</i>
<i>some low-altitude bombing</i>.

325
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,032
<i>I had no choice but to impose</i>
<i>on my best friend, Matt</i>.

326
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,667
Hey, Matt, open up!

327
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:31,034
l'm showering, man!
The side door's open!

328
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,689
What about a little privacy?

329
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:49,086
oh, man. Light a match.

330
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,954
Sorry. Hey, where's your toothpaste?

331
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:54,494
oh, get out of here. People are gonna
think we're queer or something.

332
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,100
What the hell are you doing?

333
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:36,468
l started reading
<i>The Joy of Sexuality</i>...

334
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:39,005
...checked out the part
about cunnilingus.

335
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,006
Wanted to make sure l was in shape.

336
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,968
Cunnilingus.

337
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:45,410
Yo, you've been checking out
for my mail?

338
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:46,776
Nothing came yet.

339
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,542
Brought you some food.

340
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:52,377
-No, thanks.
-Come on, it's good.

341
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:02,292
Sorry about the noise, Peter,
but l'm putting locks on all the windows.

342
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:05,366
l don't want Erica pulling another stunt
like she did yesterday.

343
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,300
Man.

344
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:14,469
l wish you'd give this up, man.

345
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:19,738
Listen, l'm not so sure l believe
your theory about the asshole gene.

346
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:23,113
oh, come on. Look.
l mean, it's everywhere you look.

347
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:25,914
-Hey, you want a taste?
-Yeah.

348
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:28,717
That's an isolated case.

349
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:30,522
All right.

350
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:35,528
What if l told you that even
our Founding Fathers were assholes?

351
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:37,723
What are you talking about?

352
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:41,234
Take the Boston Tea Party,
for instance. All right?

353
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:43,099
Even with taxation...

354
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:45,764
...the British tea cost less
than the colonial tea...

355
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:49,469
...produced by those guys
like John Hancock and Sam Adams.

356
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,204
No, don't do it!

357
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:52,942
No!

358
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,548
See, the Boston Tea Party
wasn't a political act.

359
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:02,850
lt was an industrial espionage.

360
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:05,927
lt was a scam by John Hancock
and Sam Adams...

361
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:08,859
...to put the British out of business.

362
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,499
See?

363
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,227
Even our Founding Fathers
were a bunch of assholes.

364
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:15,227
You've got a point.

365
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:19,671
But l've been thinking about this,
and l got a couple theories of my own.

366
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:21,242
Shoot.

367
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:25,575
Well, l think you can tell a lot
about a woman's personality...

368
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:27,215
...from the shape of her breasts.

369
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,146
What are you getting into right now?

370
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,810
-Take Mrs. olsen, for instance.
-What have you done?

371
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,320
Her boobs look like the turret on a tank.

372
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:39,026
Her mammaries look like they could shoot
a mortar charge, blow you to smithereens.

373
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:42,130
You can see she has the same
iron-fisted personality...

374
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,526
...that matches her hooters.

375
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,497
--you have ever been in your life.

376
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,533
All right, you got a point.

377
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:49,001
Go on.

378
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,834
Now, take the crazy lady next door.

379
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:53,498
Now, don't give me the willies.

380
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,535
No, look.
She's got mashed-potato breasts.

381
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,437
Dude, they're so weird.

382
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:01,209
-Yeah. Right. And she's weird too.
-All right.

383
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,885
But, you know,
you're just giving me easy examples.

384
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:07,852
All right. Ms. Lewis.

385
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:11,284
Bosoms like melons that have
been in the store a little too long.

386
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,921
You may be taking a chance,
buying them after the expiration date...

387
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:18,158
...but if you're lucky,
they might still be good.

388
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:20,598
She's the same way.

389
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,103
She's a little older,
but l bet she's a good woman.

390
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:32,281
okay, now, what can you deduce
from Erica's breasts?

391
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:37,515
l've done a lot of thinking about this.

392
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:40,715
As you can see,
her breasts are extremely firm.

393
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,552
So taut, you expect the nipples
to blow off...

394
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:45,751
...like a cork out of a champagne bottle.

395
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:51,362
l see this as a reflection
of Erica's effervescent, wild...

396
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:53,661
...life-is-a-party personality.

397
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:56,862
lt's also self-evident that her breasts
are on the small side.

398
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,168
l suspect it's gonna take centuries
for them to droop.

399
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:03,744
Meaning that she will
always be young at heart.

400
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:09,112
But here's something that you may miss
upon a cursory glance:

401
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:14,086
Some women's nipples can become hard
like pink pencil erasers...

402
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:17,226
...so hard that you could dial
a phone with them, you know?

403
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:21,290
These women, l suspect, are often more
concerned with the particulars in life...

404
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:24,433
...like avoiding laying in the wet spot.

405
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,363
But with Erica...

406
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:33,365
...notice how the nipple merges
almost effortlessly...

407
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:36,068
...with the areola...

408
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:39,612
...bringing a softness to her nipular area.

409
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:43,815
l think this suggests a softness of heart.

410
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:45,648
l mean, this is a girl...

411
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:50,555
...more concerned with passion
than particulars.

412
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,557
Am l right?

413
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,499
Matt?

414
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:02,832
Pete, l gotta go.

415
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,839
Something l gotta do at home. See you.

416
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:18,345
''l'm really hungry.

417
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,989
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry.''

418
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:23,887
<i>The only thing I had eaten that day</i>
<i>was Matt's watermelon</i>.

419
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,688
<i>I hadn't eaten all of it</i>
<i>for obvious reasons</i>.

420
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:30,196
<i>So I was pretty hungry by the time</i>
<i>Nonno snuck out of the house</i>.

421
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:42,274
Get down.

422
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:55,886
Nonno, what are you doing out here?

423
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:03,893
Goal!

424
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:06,865
Goal! Goal!

425
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:09,300
-Goal!
-okay. okay.

426
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:11,303
-Goal!
-okay. okay. Marge!

427
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:14,034
Your dad thinks
he's in the World Cup again.

428
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:25,483
l'm not cool enough.
She's never gonna fall for me.

429
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:28,351
Standing out here
doesn't make any sense, Nonno.

430
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,015
lt makes all the sense in the world.

431
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:35,028
You are trying to make love to a woman.

432
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:38,190
You must know,
deep in your heart of hearts...

433
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,359
...that people are supposed to make love.

434
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,937
lt is our main purpose in life.

435
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:46,098
All those other activities--

436
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:51,645
Playing the violin, washing dishes,
reading novels, drinking wine.

437
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:58,014
--are just ways of passing time
until you can make love again.

438
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:01,486
Then my whole life is passing time.

439
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:02,954
This is never gonna work.

440
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:05,094
This <i>bella,</i> Erica...

441
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:06,956
...she will fall for you.

442
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,427
lmpossible.

443
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:11,289
Crazier things have happened.

444
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:13,992
-Let me tell you another story.
-oh, great.

445
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,866
Look at all the trouble
your last one got me into, Nonno.

446
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,008
lt is about a young Navy pilot.

447
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:24,374
He could perform
incredible maneuvers in his plane.

448
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:29,107
Then, one day, he nearly crashed.

449
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:34,154
The pilot went to the doctors
and declared his problem.

450
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:35,881
Hemorrhoids.

451
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:39,687
A mass of dilated veins in the rectum.

452
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:41,295
The doctor had them removed.

453
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:43,832
What's so romantic about this story?

454
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,332
The pilot met this nurse.

455
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:48,561
Twice a day she would change
his dressings...

456
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:52,834
...and apply ointment
to his traumatized sphincter.

457
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,840
The two got to talking.

458
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:58,003
The nurse fell for the young pilot.

459
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:02,277
Now, if that isn't love,
l don't know what is.

460
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:05,480
After two weeks, the couple got married.

461
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:08,886
And if it wasn't for a swelling anus...

462
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:12,152
...the two would never have met.

463
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:15,319
Now l don't believe any of your stories.

464
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,639
lt's all true.

465
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:37,308
Ask your mom and dad.

466
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:40,654
-That was Mom and Dad?
-Yep.

467
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:59,799
<i>My massive manhood must have been</i>
<i>sapping all the blood from my brain</i>.

468
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:02,301
<i>That's the only way I could explain</i>
<i>my acceptance</i>...

469
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:04,462
...<i>of this retarded, quixotic quest</i>.

470
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,767
<i>Hours passed into days</i>.

471
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,604
<i>Nick and I got to know</i>
<i>each other better</i>.

472
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:14,874
<i>I had time on my hands</i>.

473
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:17,417
<i>I read the entire</i>
<i>Kinsey reports and found out</i>...

474
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:21,454
...<i>that 1 0 percent of all males</i>
<i>attempt self-fellatio</i>...

475
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:24,593
...<i>and that 0.3 percent actually succeed</i>.

476
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:29,663
<i>I had plenty of opportunity</i>
<i>to watch the TV of life</i>.

477
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:40,507
<i>All summer, I never saw Erica</i>
<i>wear the same thing twice</i>.

478
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,423
<i>And for Erica's sister,</i>
<i>Halloween came early</i>.

479
00:31:57,593 --> 00:32:00,084
-Now say 20 Hail Marys.
-Hail Mary. Hail Mary.

480
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:03,789
<i>My dad couldn't figure out why</i>
<i>his New Guinea impatiens wouldn't grow</i>.

481
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,263
<i>Neither could I</i>.

482
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:07,664
<i>I had been watering it regularly</i>.

483
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:12,934
<i>Surprisingly enough,</i>
<i>I earned some extra money on the side</i>.

484
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:14,974
Since l know you'll
be here all the time...

485
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:17,271
...l thought you could
babysit Robert tonight.

486
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:20,438
<i>Hey, lady, did you ever think</i>
<i>that tonight might be the night</i>...

487
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:23,949
...<i>that Erica and I tried the</i>
<i>''wailing monkey clasping a tree'' act?</i>

488
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:27,513
<i>Erica's father took</i>
<i>a sculpting class that summer</i>.

489
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,284
-What is it?
-lt's the baby Jesus.

490
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,187
l figured l'd get a little head start
on our Nativity scene for next Christmas.

491
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:39,824
<i>Little Jesus look more like an aborted fetus,</i>
<i>but I kept my mouth shut</i>.

492
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:41,833
Give me my plane!

493
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:45,230
<i>I took a liking to young Robert</i>.

494
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:46,534
Give me my plane!

495
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:50,134
<i>I was his guardian angel</i>.

496
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:52,837
<i>Sort of</i>.

497
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:56,917
The next time this guy bothers you,
all you have to do is stand up to him.

498
00:32:57,086 --> 00:32:59,782
All bullies are cowards.

499
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:01,252
Trust me.

500
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,322
<i>Days soon passed into weeks</i>.

501
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,994
<i>The guy across the street</i>

502
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,958

That's an easy one.
The Sea of Chinnereth.

-No.
-Wrong.

510
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:35,187
The duck had a bill,
the skunk had a scent...

511
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,188
...and the frog had a green back.

00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,003
Hi.

542
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:39,843
l was wondering if maybe

543
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,573
Anything.

544
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,377
Well, my parents have grounded me...

545
00:35:43,552 --> 00:35:46,646
...and l really wanna
go see Nick tonight...

546
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:49,222
...so l was hoping you might
help me get down.

547
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,827
okay.

548
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:55,987
<i>It was against my principles</i>
<i>to help Erica with Nick</i>...

549

...<i>but this was at least a way</i>
<i>to talk to her</i>.

550
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,192
<i>And in that short skirt</i>...

551

557

558
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,327
Pussy Galore.

559
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,900
-<i>And we talked</i>.
-She was like this tough chick.

560
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,536
And there is no doubt about it...

561
00:36:35,704 --> 00:36:38,764
...Roger Moore is by far

<i>Roger Moore? Come on</i>.

Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

565
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,246

<i>My God, what was I saying?</i>

00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:55,014
<i>Erica's beauty had more power</i>
<i>over me than I thought</i>.

568
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,820
l mean, for me, Sean Connery
is just way too hairy.

569
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:04,864
And it really bugs me the way
he talks like this.

570
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:08,060
''Where's M, Miss Moneypenny?''

571
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:10,330
Thank God they never replaced
Desmond Llewelyn.

572
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:12,474
He is so great as Q.

573
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:16,402
<i>Erica even knew that</i>
<i>Desmond Llewelyn played Q</i>.

574

<i>Now I know I'm in love</i>.

575
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,639
This may sound crazy...

576
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:24,445
...but sometimes when l'm depressed
that the world is a really terrible place...

577
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,317
...l find myself sympathizing
with the Bond villains.

578
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,253
-What do you mean?
-Well...

579
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:32,917
...remember how Curt Jurgens,
in <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>...

580
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:35,529
...wanted to create a perfect society
under the sea?

581
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:38,428
And in <i>Moonraker,</i>
Hugo Drax wanted to do the same thing...

582
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,965
-...in space?
-Right.

583
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,228
Well, these guys really weren't so bad.

584
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:45,669
They were just tired of the war,
the politics, pollution and--

585
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,900
And wanted to change things.

586
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:50,739
Then this handsome womanizer
who's afraid of commitment...

587
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:54,542
...pulls up in his fancy sports car
and messes things up...

588
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:57,550
...just to protect the status quo.

589
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,415
l mean...

590
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:02,682
...sometimes l wish the world
could just start over, you know?

591
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:06,956
That's deep.

592
00:38:07,129 --> 00:38:09,825
No, l think the blue M&M's,
they were a good choice.

593
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,192
No way.

594
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,061
<i>I talked to her more in those weeks</i>...

595
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:16,534
...<i>than I did the previous 1 4 years</i>
<i>I lived across the street from her</i>.

596
00:38:16,705 --> 00:38:20,232
So if you were to be afflicted with
either of the following, which would it be:

597
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:23,173
Halitosis or incontinence?

598
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:26,203
Halitosis.

599
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:29,873
l figure l could always stock up
on breath mints.

600
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:31,576
okay, l have one for you.

601
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:34,848
Would you rather lose your eyesight...

602
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,389
...or the use of both of your legs?

603
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,260
-That's too hard.
-No.

604
00:38:39,428 --> 00:38:41,862
Come on. You have to answer.
Those are the rules.

605
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:45,965
Probably, l'd lose my eyesight.

606
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:48,899
Your face is etched into my memory.

607
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:53,371
l'd always be able to see you,
and with my legs...

608
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,840
...l could still make love to you.

609
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:02,712
Good night, Peter.

610
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:04,679
Night.

611
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,450
Hey.

612
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:15,915
What's up?

613
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:19,325
You promise you're not gonna laugh?

614
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:21,329
Sure.

615
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:29,998
-Come on. You said you wouldn't laugh.
-l'm sorry.

616
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,704
-Can l feel?
-Knock it off.

617
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:36,400
Look, l was trying to
spice up my love life...

618
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:38,773
...and my parents came home
a little bit early.

619
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:41,643
They wanted to talk to me
and ended up searching for me.

620
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:45,685
So l figured the best thing to do
was just get out of the house.

621
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:48,883
Here, unhook me.

622
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,292
l don't know how girls do this...

623
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,792
...because this thing
was a bitch to get on.

624
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,562
Come on.

625
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:57,460
Yeah, it's a bitch.

626
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,767
Here. Can you hang on to it
till l can sneak it back in?

627
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:02,631
And stop smirking.

628
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:05,432
l'm not the first guy that's tried this.

629
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:08,975
What does that Kinsey book say about it?

630
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:15,683
l think maybe you should
give it a rest for a while.

631
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,479
You know, save some for your true love.

632
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:23,089
Peter, remember that story
we read in seventh grade...

633
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:26,125
...the one in <i>Scholastic Magazine</i>
about the heroin addict...

634
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:28,889
...who was so whacked out
that he pulled out his eyeballs?

635
00:41:29,264 --> 00:41:32,165
They said the dude's eyeballs
was hanging down below his knees...

636
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:34,268
...still attached to his veins
or something.

637
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:35,562
-Yeah, l remember.
-Yeah.

638
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:37,227
Well, it wasn't true.

639
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:39,567
They just printed that to scare us.

640
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,437
Look, it's all propaganda, Pete.

641
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,545
Just like true love is.

642
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:48,513
You know what?
You and me ain't never gonna find it.

643
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:56,517
Did you see that 0.3 percent of all males
succeed in self-fellatio?

644
00:41:56,692 --> 00:42:00,150
Have you noticed the guy across the street
never takes his wife out anymore?

645
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:01,728
No.

646
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,999
Anything come in the mail for me yet?

647
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:09,103
Remember that weird conversation
we saw him having with that woman?

648
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:12,536
And she was saying,
''Don't do it. Don't do it.''

649
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:14,866
Yeah.

650
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:18,535
Hey, maybe the other woman's
his lover, right?

651
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:20,648
And he says, ''l'm gonna kill my wife.''

652
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:24,513
And she says,
''No, don't do it. Don't do it.''

653
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:26,415
You think?

654
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:30,517
Well, l know if my wife were an invalid,
l'd be that horny.

655
00:42:30,692 --> 00:42:32,489
You're sick.

656
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:34,891
Come on, Pete, everybody is.

657
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:37,395
The question is...

658
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,226
...what's he done with her body?

659
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:52,342
How exactly would you go about...

660
00:42:52,514 --> 00:42:54,948
...cutting up a dead body?

661
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,211
Well, that's a hacksaw.

662
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,353
Me?

663
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,814
l'd use a chain saw.

664
00:43:21,676 --> 00:43:24,304
<i>The next day, little Robert</i>
<i>decided to take my advice</i>...

665
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,674
...<i>and stand up</i>
<i>to the tyranny of assholes</i>.

666
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:43,455

667

00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:56,310
<i>I was practicing my one-handed technique</i>
<i>when disaster struck</i>.

670
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,204
<i>Nick and Erica had</i>
<i>just come back from the lake</i>.

671
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:04,680
<i>Unfortunately, Erica's parents</i>
<i>let her out once in a while</i>.

672
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,187
No, come on.
You remember in that one movie.

673
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:11,723
l mean, that just proves
that Roger Moore...

674
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:13,758
...is by far the best James Bond.

675
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,397
<i>Erica looked great, of course</i>.

676
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:19,056
He's all right, l agree he's not bad.

677
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:23,694
<i>But I nearly hurled</i>
<i>at the sight of Nick in his Speedo</i>.

678
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:25,736
<i>He was huge!</i>

679
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:29,365
<i>He immediately makes you think</i>
<i>of the words ''</i>Apollo <i>rocket. ''</i>

680
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:31,444
<i>How the hell was I gonna</i>
<i>compete with that?</i>

681
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:36,277
<i>I was India's space program</i>
<i>compared to his Cape Kennedy</i>.

682
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,577
Hey, you brought the protection, right?

683
00:44:39,955 --> 00:44:42,423
<i>The protection?!</i>
<i>Where were her parents?</i>

684
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:45,324
<i>Where was Christ's vice squad</i>
<i>when I needed them most?</i>

685
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:46,756
Come in, <i>Apollo 1 2</i>.

686
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:48,691
We have you cleared for takeoff.

687
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:52,459
Roger that, mission control.
We are ready for liftoff.

688
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:55,865
We have liftoff in 1 0, nine--

689
00:44:56,037 --> 00:44:57,368
<i>I had to do something</i>.

690
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:00,167
<i>I had to abort Nick's trip to Venus</i>.

691
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:02,037
<i>I did the only thing I could think of</i>.

692
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,007
--two, one.

693
00:45:16,024 --> 00:45:17,582
<i>I don't know why this came to me</i>.

694
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:20,284
<i>It must have been</i>
<i>a word association with ''come. ''</i>

695
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:48,913
<i>It seemed to do the trick</i>.

696
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,717
Nick, stop.

697
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,292
<i>Apollo 1 2</i>, we've had a malfunction.

698
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:54,689
Abort liftoff.

699
00:45:56,364 --> 00:45:58,229
<i>I had visions</i>
<i>that I could take Nick out</i>...

700
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,527
...<i>with my expert knowledge</i>
<i>of the martial arts</i>.

701
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,030
Finish him!

702
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:09,473
<i>But that's not what happened</i>.

703
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:14,544
<i>Towering above me, Nick hawked</i>
<i>the biggest loogie ever</i>.

704
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:17,776
<i>I trembled,</i>
<i>knowing it was intended for me</i>.

705
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,657
oh, my God.

706
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,456
You stuff.

707
00:46:26,294 --> 00:46:27,693
You stuff.

708
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:37,533
lf you tell anybody, you're dead.

709
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,975
Houston, we have liftoff.

710
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:15,203
-Dad, what are you doing?
-Having a yard sale.

711
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:16,844
This is my stuff.

712
00:47:17,012 --> 00:47:19,947
Since you don't live with us anymore,
didn't figure you needed it.

713
00:47:20,115 --> 00:47:22,049
How much for
the Sandy Koufax baseball card?

714
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:23,445
What, 25 cents?

715
00:47:23,618 --> 00:47:25,882
That's a collector's edition.
lt's worth 50 bucks.

716
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:27,248
Really?

717
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:29,686
Twenty-five cents and not a cent less.

718
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:32,019
-Sold.
-Thanks.

719
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:37,231
Mom.

720
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:39,894
oh, how much for
the electric toothbrush?

721
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,933
For you, a special price.

722
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:44,230
-A buck.
-Yeah.

723
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:46,271
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

724
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:48,537
Matt, what are you doing?

725
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,268
l use one of these at my grandma's.

726
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:53,414
lf you do it right,
feels just like a vibrator.

727
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:56,778
<i>Figlio,</i> what the hell are you doing
with your boy's things?

728
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:00,250
-Dad, they're not his things.
-Give you $5 for this collection of <i>Playpen</i>.

729
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:02,322
-l give you 6!
-You're not a customer.

-You have no right to sell his things!
-Pages are sticky.

731
00:48:05,193 --> 00:48:06,490
-That's disgusting.
-No right!

732
00:48:06,661 --> 00:48:08,959
-okay, 4 bucks.
-Four bucks?

733
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,563
No, no, no. No!

734
00:48:10,732 --> 00:48:13,895
-You have no right! You--
-All right.

735
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:16,094
-Papa?
-Nonno?

736
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:18,263
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

737
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,340
-Papa!
-okay. okay.

738
00:48:20,508 --> 00:48:22,135

739
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,538
<i>Good old Nonno</i>.

00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:32,916
-Yard sale's over!
-Papa, speak to me!

743
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:35,784
-Good one, Nonno.
-ls anyone a doctor?

744
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:38,983
Please, we need some help here!

-l don't know what we can do.
-What's happening?

746
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:48,259
What is wrong?

747
00:48:48,436 --> 00:48:49,698
-Daddy.
-He's not breathing.

748
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:51,805
-What do you mean?
-He doesn't have a pulse.

749
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:53,406
Somebody call 91 1 .

750
00:48:53,575 --> 00:48:55,304
-Somebody call 91 1 !
-Please call 91 1 !

751
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,738
-Nonno.
-Do it now! Hurry! Hurry!

752
00:48:58,913 --> 00:49:00,141
Nonno.

753
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:02,607
Tell them you're faking. Come on.

754
00:49:02,784 --> 00:49:04,308
-Are you faking, Daddy?
-Come on.

755
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:05,976
He's not faking. What--? Faking?

756
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,884
Papa-- Papa, speak to me.

757
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:11,482
oh, no.

758
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:24,330
<i>I didn't stand under Erica's window</i>
<i>for the next couple of days</i>.

759
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:26,474
<i>I figured I was allowed</i>.

760
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:28,973
<i>My dad blamed me</i>
<i>for what happened</i>.

761
00:49:29,144 --> 00:49:32,113
<i>He said if I still decided</i>
<i>to continue with my lunacy</i>...

762
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,441
...<i>he would continue to lock me out</i>.

763
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:35,981
<i>With an asshole like my dad</i>...

764
00:49:36,151 --> 00:49:39,518
...<i>I'm surprised I didn't inherit</i>

ls that what l think it is?

766
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:58,669
Jesus.

767
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,174
l'm getting excited right after
my grandfather's own funeral.

768
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:05,471
You must think l'm sick.

769
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:13,049
l just think it means Nonno's spirit
runs strong in you.

770
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,167
Hey. Brought back
your electric toothbrush.

771
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,368
How thoughtful.

772
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:37,033
You know, it doesn't vibrate as good
as l thought it would. Here, feel.

773
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:41,148
No, l'm not touching that,
let alone putting it in my mouth.

774
00:50:41,316 --> 00:50:44,911
-l washed it off. l swear.
-Just keep it.

775
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:50,388
You're just in a crappy mood because you
realize this Romeo act is a dumb-ass idea.

776
00:50:50,725 --> 00:50:53,353
l haven't decided whether
to give this up yet.

777
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:57,862
Erica was so sweet today,
you could have poured her over pancakes.

778
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,527
But she hasn't given me any indication
that l have a chance with her.

779
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:04,001
Well, l'll tell you.

780
00:51:04,172 --> 00:51:06,936
The fact that Nick's giving her
the old Roto-Rooter...

781
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:09,099
...ain't a good sign.

782
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:12,974
Nonno was the only one
who thought this was a good idea.

783
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:17,383
Maybe l should just bite the big one
and call it quits.

784
00:51:17,919 --> 00:51:20,285
Bite away, my friend.

785
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:23,317
Stop it!

786
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:26,324
Stop it! Stop!

787
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:40,902
You see?

788
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:43,703
Nice guys don't always finish last.

789
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,145
You're not gonna give up now, are you?

790
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,982
-Nope.
-oh, man.

791
00:51:52,153 --> 00:51:55,145
Your grandfather croaking
was your perfect out.

792
00:51:57,992 --> 00:51:59,960
<i>I started reading Casanova</i>.

793
00:52:00,128 --> 00:52:02,995

00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:04,825
<i>I should be so lucky</i>.

795
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:06,523
<i>The excitement of the past days</i>...

796

...<i>had completely lobotomized me to</i>

...<i>I saw my man carry out</i>
<i>some suspicious bags</i>...

798

...<i>and put them in the trunk of his car</i>.

799
00:52:37,165 --> 00:52:40,692
<i>A couple of nights later,</i>
<i>I had an unexpected visitor</i>.

800
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:43,403
<i>It was Ms. Lewis</i>...

801
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:46,540
...<i>the pretty divorcée</i>
<i>from down the street</i>.

802
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:50,337
<i>Her body was smoldering</i>
<i>like a lit cigarette</i>.

803
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:55,675
Hello, Peter.

804
00:52:56,884 --> 00:52:58,681
Ms. Lewis.

805
00:52:58,853 --> 00:53:01,822
l was hoping you could cut my grass.

806
00:53:03,524 --> 00:53:05,958
l'm not mowing lawns this year.

807
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:08,620
l'll make it worth your while.

808
00:53:08,796 --> 00:53:10,354
And...

809
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:12,931
...you won't have to bag it.

810
00:53:14,769 --> 00:53:16,794
l can't.

811
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:19,296
What am l to do?

812
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:25,409
lt needs to be cut at least twice a week.

813
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:30,176
lt grows so fast.

814
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:31,613
<i>She was coming on to me</i>.

815
00:53:31,786 --> 00:53:33,310
<i>I was paralyzed</i>.

816
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:35,115
<i>I didn't know what to do</i>.

817
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:39,089
<i>Fortunately, I didn't have to do anything</i>.
<i>She did it all</i>.

818
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,155
<i>I thought, ''This might be my chance</i>.

819
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:47,165
<i>If Erica comes to the balcony and sees me</i>
<i>with another woman, she'll be jealous. ''</i>

820
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:49,967
Stay away from him. He's my man.

821
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:53,505
<i>Then I had a fear that Erica was</i>
<i>the type of girl who would enjoy watching</i>.

822
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,869
<i>I decided to put my all into it</i>.

823
00:53:58,046 --> 00:54:01,846
<i>If Erica saw how good I was,</i>
<i>she would want me even more</i>.

824
00:54:04,485 --> 00:54:08,182
<i>But I also worried she might be as harsh on</i>
<i>my performance as an East German judge</i>.

825
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:13,018
<i>What was I doing?</i>
<i>If Erica sees me like this</i>...

826
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:15,992
...<i>I would jeopardize all</i>
<i>I had worked for all summer</i>.

827
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:20,032
<i>I had to stop, but Ms. Lewis was</i>
<i>most persuasive</i>.

828
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:21,896
<i>How could I tell her no now?</i>

829
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:26,336
<i>I tried to think of anything</i>
<i>other than sex</i>.

830
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:38,649
What happened?

831
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:44,824
l don't know.

832
00:54:44,992 --> 00:54:48,450
Maybe now's not a good time.

833
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:50,392
Perhaps it's....

834
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:54,262
Perhaps it's because l've been trying
to get this girl to notice me.

835
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:58,104
Yes, l know.

836
00:54:59,006 --> 00:55:02,464
l know all about it.
lt's what makes you so exciting.

837
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:06,080
l'm sorry.

838
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:13,080
Hey!

839
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,185
What happened to you?

840
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:21,726
l tried to become part
of that 0.3 percent.

841
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:24,725
What do you mean?

842
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:29,565
Your Kinsey reports.

843
00:55:29,737 --> 00:55:32,797
l tried to suck myself off
and l hurt my neck.

844
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:35,636
Now l gotta wear this stupid thing.

845
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:39,710
-Hey, anything come in the mail for me yet?
-Nope.

846
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:41,815
What's the matter with you?

847
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:44,082
Nothing.

848
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:45,719
Something's wrong.

849
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:47,286
Nothing's wrong.

850
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,650
Yes, there is.

851
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:51,291
See...

852
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:55,987
...normally, you would have asked me
if l succeeded in my venture of self-fellatio.

853
00:55:56,164 --> 00:55:58,155
But you didn't ask that.

854
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,265
Well, did you?

855
00:56:01,435 --> 00:56:04,893
l will only tell you
when you tell me what's wrong.

856
00:56:07,942 --> 00:56:09,307
okay.

857
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:10,910
l succeeded.

858
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:13,046
-No, you didn't.
-Yeah.

859
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:14,579
only for a second, though...

860
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:17,513
...before l snapped something
in my neck.

861
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:20,347
Did you know it tastes like roast beef?

862
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:22,489
Which l actually found reassuring.

863
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:25,421
See, l always thought that
girls must hate giving head...

864
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:29,529
...but if you think about it,
it's kind of like a trip to the Sizzler.

865
00:56:30,698 --> 00:56:32,723
Come on, tell me what's bothering you.

866
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:36,394
l'm running out of time.

867
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:38,630
Erica leaves for college
in a couple of weeks.

868
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:40,831
l'm beginning to think
this isn't gonna work.

869
00:56:41,008 --> 00:56:43,169
She probably thinks l'm
even more of a schmuck.

870
00:56:43,344 --> 00:56:44,777
Yeah, well, l told you so.

871
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:47,210
l don't need to hear that from you.

872
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:49,474
You're supposed to be my friend.

873
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,676
l was just trying to give you
some good advice.

874
00:56:52,854 --> 00:56:54,378
Advice.

875
00:56:55,022 --> 00:56:56,956
Why would l take advice from a guy...

876
00:56:57,124 --> 00:57:00,389
...who broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick?

877
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:02,791
Because l am enterprising.

878
00:57:05,132 --> 00:57:08,568
<i>There was one thing I hadn't tried yet</i>
<i>to become Erica's love slave</i>...

879
00:57:08,736 --> 00:57:11,569
...<i>and that was impressing her</i>
<i>by pissing her parents off</i>.

880
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:14,037
<i>Giuseppe had been working on a plan</i>.

881
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,608
<i>We were just waiting</i>
<i>for the right opportunity</i>.

882
00:57:17,378 --> 00:57:18,902
<i>Finally it presented itself</i>.

883
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:23,645
<i>Erica's father and his friends were</i>
<i>competing for some Easter pageant contest</i>.

884
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:25,479
<i>One where 1 2 guys in bed sheets</i>...

885
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:29,453
...<i>hold a pose of Leonardo da Vinci's</i>
Last Supper <i>for over five minutes</i>.

886
00:57:29,624 --> 00:57:31,922
<i>The team with the best tableau</i>
<i>gets to perform it</i>...

887
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:35,256
...<i>at the National Cathedral</i>
<i>for the president or something</i>.

888
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:39,799
Darn it, Phil. You moved.

889
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:42,197
l couldn't help it. l had an itch.

890
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,497
We were only two minutes
and 1 3 seconds into it.

891
00:57:44,672 --> 00:57:48,472
We're gonna have to hold it twice that long
if we stand any chance to win this thing.

892
00:57:48,643 --> 00:57:51,373
lt's easy for you.
You get to rest your elbows on the table.

893
00:57:51,545 --> 00:57:53,877
Try holding your arms out
like this for five minutes.

894
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:56,573
-lt's not that hard.
-Yeah? Then you try it.

895
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:59,083
Why do you get to be Jesus every year?

896
00:57:59,387 --> 00:58:02,288
Because l organize this thing.
l'm the leader.

897
00:58:02,456 --> 00:58:04,185
l'm tired of playing Judas
all the time.

898
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:06,519
Come on, Phil. You make a great Judas.

899
00:58:08,095 --> 00:58:09,722
What is that supposed to mean?

900
00:58:11,565 --> 00:58:14,125
And where do you think
you're going, young lady?

901
00:58:14,302 --> 00:58:16,702
Nick got tickets to Lollapalooza,
so we're going.

902
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,533
Well, don't you remember?
l banned you from going out.

903
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:21,607
Can't you make an exception
this one time?

904
00:58:21,776 --> 00:58:23,471
No! You're not leaving this house.

905
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:26,408
Dad, what are you talking about?
This is not fair!

906
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,746
lt is time, my friend.

907
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:31,976
-You're treating me like l'm 1 0!
-You're acting like you're 1 0!

908
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:34,417
Now, l don't enjoy doing this,
but it is my resp--

909
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:37,216
Let her go, or the baby Jesus gets it.

910
00:58:38,225 --> 00:58:39,920
Peter. Wha--?

911
00:58:40,394 --> 00:58:41,759
l mean it.

912
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,058
l cannot have you desecrate
the baby Jesus.

913
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:53,731
All right, Erica.

914
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,569
You may go.

915
00:59:00,948 --> 00:59:02,540
Now give him to me.

916
00:59:02,717 --> 00:59:06,676
l'll give him back at the end of the summer,
when Erica leaves for college.

917
00:59:06,854 --> 00:59:09,049
lt's not fair you keep her
locked up in here.

918
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:11,248
Why, you-- Get him!

919
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:26,235
So how do you think Jesus
really feels...

920
00:59:26,407 --> 00:59:29,399
...about having his name
on all those bumper stickers?

921
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:41,882
So my father's pretty pissed.

922
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:44,254
Yeah.

923
00:59:47,028 --> 00:59:49,360
You didn't have to do that, you know.

924
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:53,429
l wanted to.

925
00:59:56,203 --> 00:59:57,727
Thanks.

926
01:00:07,748 --> 01:00:09,773
Well, good night.

927
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:23,522
What? She only gave you
a peck on the cheek...

928
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:25,096
...after what you did for her?

929
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:27,063
l know. What does that mean?

930
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:28,701
l'll tell you what it means.

931
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:32,771
lt means you ain't never gonna make
the beast with two backs with her, friend.

932
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,170
l don't know.
We've been talking a lot lately.

933
01:00:35,576 --> 01:00:37,806
Yeah, sure. You're in the friend zone.

934
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:40,674
-ls that bad?
-Bad? lt's the worst.

935
01:00:40,848 --> 01:00:42,440
Come on. Girls don't want a friend.

936
01:00:42,616 --> 01:00:44,584
They want a human piston.

937
01:00:44,752 --> 01:00:49,280
Well, maybe l still got a chance at becoming
her ''human piston,'' as you put it.

938
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:50,822
We're not that good of friends.

939
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:53,516
Are you kidding me?
You're doing life in the friend zone.

940
01:00:53,694 --> 01:00:56,629
-You think so?
-l know so.

941
01:01:03,003 --> 01:01:07,440
So, what's up with our psycho killer
over there across the street?

942
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:12,102
Well, l snuck over there the other night
to take a peek at what he was up to.

943
01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:15,271
-He nearly caught me.
-See, l told you. l knew it.

944
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:17,713
-The guy's nuts.
-l'm not so sure.

945
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,050
Past couple of nights l've seen him take
garbage bags out filled with something.

946
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:25,386
Bet you he's taking his wife out
piece by piece.

947
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:27,959
lt's a lot of bags for just one person.

948
01:01:28,129 --> 01:01:30,256
Maybe he's taking out
his whole family.

949
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:32,922
l know l've thought about it myself.

950
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:35,232
l don't think he has any family.

951
01:01:36,437 --> 01:01:37,461
lt's here, man.

952
01:01:37,938 --> 01:01:39,371
-There you go.
-Yes, it's here!

953
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,407
-Look, dude, it's finally here!
-What's finally here?

954
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:44,373
lt's an orgasmatron.

955
01:01:44,545 --> 01:01:46,035
l ordered it in <i>Shaved</i> magazine.

956
01:01:46,213 --> 01:01:47,703
Check it out. See?

957
01:01:47,882 --> 01:01:50,043
lt runs on battery or AC.

958
01:01:50,217 --> 01:01:52,310
lt's a new era, Pete.

959
01:01:52,486 --> 01:01:55,478
You know they have a name now
for electronic sex?

960
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:57,988
-What's that?
-''Dildonics.''

961
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,592
Pretty cool.

962
01:02:01,028 --> 01:02:03,394
Dildonics.

963
01:02:03,564 --> 01:02:06,362
lt kind of makes you sound like a homo.

964
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:10,794
l never thought of it like that.

965
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:14,065
Anyway, it's a bold new frontier, man.

966
01:02:14,241 --> 01:02:16,675
l'll let you borrow it any time you want.

967
01:02:23,484 --> 01:02:24,815
That's okay.

968
01:02:24,985 --> 01:02:27,180
Listen, with the way
things are going with you...

969
01:02:27,354 --> 01:02:30,585
...you may wanna consider
my plan of self-sufficiency.

970
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:38,295
<i>The friend zone had</i>
<i>an incredible hold on me</i>.

971
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:41,366
<i>I couldn't escape its hellish grasp</i>.

972
01:02:41,535 --> 01:02:44,993
So who would you rather be:
Paul McCartney or John Lennon?

973
01:02:45,172 --> 01:02:46,969
That's obvious. John Lennon.

974
01:02:47,141 --> 01:02:48,608
Yeah, but you'd be dead now.

975
01:02:48,776 --> 01:02:51,870
So what? At least l'd be
the coolest of all the Beatles.

976
01:02:52,446 --> 01:02:55,745
l don't know. He did marry Yoko ono.

977
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:59,443
People underestimate Paul McCartney.
He's written some pretty good music.

978
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,645
Like ''Ebony and lvory''?

979
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,849
okay. You're right.

980
01:03:05,025 --> 01:03:07,892
You know, l don't think it'd be so hard
being a songwriter.

981
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:10,223
-oh, yeah?
-l mean, if you're a novelist...

982
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:12,661
...you have to come up with
every sentence, every word.

983
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,859
lf you're a businessman,
your reports have to be well-thought-out...

984
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:19,301
-...with sound financial conclusions, right?
-Right.

985
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:22,840
But if you're a songwriter, and you can't
figure out how to end a song...

986
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,035
...you just fade out.

987
01:03:25,212 --> 01:03:26,372
lt's easy.

988
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,307
Yeah. You're right.

989
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:32,248
What other job lets you finish it up
by just fading out?

990
01:03:32,886 --> 01:03:34,581
A film director.

991
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:42,127
<i>So it went on like this</i>.

992
01:03:42,296 --> 01:03:46,426
<i>Maybe Erica was right</i>.
<i>We were just friends</i>.

993
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,001
You never told me. What's the worst thing
your parents ever did to you?

994
01:03:50,337 --> 01:03:52,430
l guess the worst thing
my dad ever did...

995
01:03:52,606 --> 01:03:55,905
...was speak at career day
to my third-grade class.

996
01:03:56,076 --> 01:04:00,274
He talked for over half an hour
about the joys of being a radiologist...

997
01:04:00,447 --> 01:04:05,077
...and then proceeded to treat
the entire class to a chocolate barium.

998
01:04:05,252 --> 01:04:06,981
That's bad.

999
01:04:08,555 --> 01:04:09,647
So, what about you?

1000
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:13,192
lt must have been the time l was 5.

1001
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,124
My dad and l were at
the Lighthouse Christian Store.

1002
01:04:16,297 --> 01:04:18,094
lt was January...

1003
01:04:18,265 --> 01:04:20,233
...and he was buying Christmas cards.

1004
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:23,199
He always does that.
Buys Christmas cards in January...

1005
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,770
...when the previous year's selection
go on sale.

1006
01:04:25,939 --> 01:04:27,770
Anyway, l had just learned to count.

1007
01:04:27,941 --> 01:04:29,465
So l was always counting things...

1008
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:33,044
...like the number of stop lights
on the way to the store, stuff like that.

1009
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:35,704
When the cashier gave my dad
his change back...

1010
01:04:35,883 --> 01:04:38,875
...l had noticed that she'd given him
the wrong amount.

1011
01:04:39,053 --> 01:04:41,783
She'd given him too much.

1012
01:04:41,955 --> 01:04:45,391
And l looked up at my dad,
and he had noticed too.

1013
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:46,821
But he didn't do anything.

1014
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:51,291
He just took the money
and put it in his wallet, and we left.

1015
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:55,499
lt was right then, l guess...

1016
01:04:55,669 --> 01:04:59,264
...that l stopped believing
my parents were perfect people.

1017
01:05:02,543 --> 01:05:04,135
Well...

1018
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:06,340
...good night, Peter.

1019
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:10,948
Night.

1020
01:05:12,853 --> 01:05:17,313
<i>If Erica had lost all trust in her parents,</i>
<i>how could she trust anything?</i>

1021
01:05:18,025 --> 01:05:20,425
<i>How could she trust that I loved her?</i>

1022
01:05:20,794 --> 01:05:23,319
<i>I was beginning to think Matt was right</i>.

1023
01:05:23,497 --> 01:05:26,125
<i>I had tried everything</i>
<i>to win over my beloved Erica</i>...

1024
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,825
...<i>but nothing had worked</i>.
<i>Nothing was going to work</i>.

1025
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:31,027
<i>It had only stranded me</i>
<i>in the friend zone</i>...

1026
01:05:31,205 --> 01:05:34,174
...<i>like Charlton Heston being marooned</i>
<i>in the</i> Planet of the Apes.

1027
01:05:34,341 --> 01:05:36,809
<i>I was so unhappy,</i>
<i>whereas my best bud, Matt</i>...

1028
01:05:36,977 --> 01:05:40,674
...<i>had fallen in love with a robot</i>
<i>which gives blowjobs</i>.

1029
01:05:42,216 --> 01:05:45,879
<i>Maybe I was the strange one, not him</i>.
<i>At least he was happy</i>.

1030
01:05:48,188 --> 01:05:51,123
My dick! My dick!

1031
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:25,224
Here, you try.

1032
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,588
lt's silly.

1033
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:30,025
So? lt's fun.
lt'll make you feel like a kid again.

1034
01:06:30,197 --> 01:06:31,994
Now, go on.

1035
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,394
That's it.

1036
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:36,495
Go, have fun.

1037
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:34,293
You know,
everybody thinks you're crazy.

1038
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:36,053
So what?

1039
01:07:37,364 --> 01:07:38,763
Well....

1040
01:07:38,932 --> 01:07:41,457
l mean, you gotta admit,
you do some pretty weird things.

1041
01:07:41,635 --> 01:07:43,569
l don't think so.

1042
01:07:44,872 --> 01:07:46,533
Well...

1043
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:50,375
...explain why you sometimes
go out to your car and eat dinner.

1044
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:53,513
My car radio gets better reception
than the one on my stereo.

1045
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,376
l go out there to listen to my opera.

1046
01:07:58,785 --> 01:08:01,253
What about doing your gardening
in a scuba mask?

1047
01:08:01,421 --> 01:08:05,016
l love to garden,
but l'm allergic to pollen.

1048
01:08:05,192 --> 01:08:09,788
lt's the only way l can work in the yard
without having my eyes all tear up.

1049
01:08:12,032 --> 01:08:14,227
okay. But admit it.

1050
01:08:14,401 --> 01:08:17,199
Cutting your grass
in the middle of the night?

1051
01:08:17,371 --> 01:08:18,736
lt's a little strange.

1052
01:08:18,906 --> 01:08:20,533
With this humidity?

1053
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:23,505
Nighttime's the only sane time
to cut the grass.

1054
01:08:24,144 --> 01:08:26,510
What about sitting on your roof
with the telephone?

1055
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,977
oh, that.

1056
01:08:29,016 --> 01:08:33,282
My best friend, Mabel, lives
just a couple of blocks away from here.

1057
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:38,018
She's going senile,
but she won't admit it...

1058
01:08:38,191 --> 01:08:40,853
...and she insists on driving her car.

1059
01:08:41,028 --> 01:08:43,258
So when she's coming over to visit...

1060
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,762
...l go up on my roof.

1061
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:48,861
l can see her back out of her driveway.

1062
01:08:49,036 --> 01:08:50,765
And if she makes a wrong turn...

1063
01:08:50,938 --> 01:08:53,406
...l call her on her car phone,
give her directions.

1064
01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:55,269
voilà.

1065
01:08:58,345 --> 01:09:01,837
-lt all makes sense.
-Everything does.

1066
01:09:02,983 --> 01:09:06,043
Just depends on your perspective.

1067
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:11,818
This is the worst day of my life.

1068
01:09:11,992 --> 01:09:14,893
The orgasmatron shorted out on me.

1069
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:17,360
Gave my penis an electric shock.

1070
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:18,862
You didn't like that?

1071
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:20,522
No, you don't understand, okay?

1072
01:09:20,701 --> 01:09:23,295
l can't get it up anymore.
lt doesn't work.

1073
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,438
Just leave it alone for a little while.

1074
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:27,471
l'm sure it just needs a little R and R.

1075
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:29,006
Yeah, l know. l tried that.

1076
01:09:29,176 --> 01:09:31,167
l waited all morning
and then tried it again.

1077
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:32,903
lt still doesn't work.

1078
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,605
l couldn't even get it to go to half-mast.

1079
01:09:36,183 --> 01:09:37,582
Hey, what if you're right?

1080
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:40,720
What if a guy only has
a finite number of erections...

1081
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:43,117
...and l've used all mine up?

1082
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:44,887
Well, what are you gonna do?

1083
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:48,553
l do have an emergency plan
for such an event...

1084
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:51,789
...but l'm gonna need your help.

1085
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,899
No way, man. lt's too weird for me.

1086
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,731
Come on, man.

1087
01:09:58,905 --> 01:10:00,600
Look, it's nothing like that, okay?

1088
01:10:02,109 --> 01:10:05,510
l got some money saved up,
and there's this lady on the boulevard.

1089
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,012
Let's just say she's an experienced lady.

1090
01:10:09,316 --> 01:10:12,114
For 1 00 bucks,
she'll do it any way you want.

1091
01:10:12,285 --> 01:10:13,616
What do you need me for?

1092
01:10:13,787 --> 01:10:16,187
l can't do this alone.
l need you to go with me.

1093
01:10:16,356 --> 01:10:18,381
Now, l got 1 50 saved up.

1094
01:10:18,558 --> 01:10:20,788
Hey, we could work a two-for-one deal.

1095
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:22,719
No way.

1096
01:10:22,896 --> 01:10:24,420
Come on, man.

1097
01:10:24,598 --> 01:10:26,327
l'll even take sloppy seconds.

1098
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:32,264
Just forget it.

1099
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:35,067
l've only got a few days left
to win Erica's love.

1100
01:10:35,242 --> 01:10:37,802
Even if she doesn't fall in love with me...

1101
01:10:37,978 --> 01:10:40,708
...l've decided to stick it out
until the end of the summer.

1102
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:42,815
That way, l know l've tried everything.

1103
01:10:42,983 --> 01:10:44,678
Please, man.

1104
01:10:45,452 --> 01:10:47,181
Come on, man. lt's an emergency.

1105
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:49,447
l need your help.

1106
01:10:50,023 --> 01:10:52,014
l can't.

1107
01:10:52,192 --> 01:10:54,490
What kind of friend are you?

1108
01:10:54,661 --> 01:10:57,061
l mean, you've spent
our last great summer together...

1109
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,164
...standing under
some stupid girl's window.

1110
01:10:59,332 --> 01:11:02,324
And do l say a word about it to you?
No, not once.

1111
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:04,060
But then, when l need you...

1112
01:11:04,237 --> 01:11:06,671
...in the middle of the biggest crisis
in my life...

1113
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,865
...you don't even consider it?

1114
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:10,669
You're a dickwad, you know that?

1115
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:13,779
Yeah. No wonder Erica doesn't like you.

1116
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:16,872
-Take it back.
-No.

1117
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:18,517
No. You know what?

1118
01:11:18,685 --> 01:11:21,449
You're a asswipe,
and she's never gonna love you.

1119
01:11:21,621 --> 01:11:22,610
-Take it back!
-No!

1120
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:24,188
-Come on!
-Yeah. Take it back.

1121
01:11:24,357 --> 01:11:25,381
-No!
-Yeah. Yeah.

1122
01:11:25,559 --> 01:11:27,117
Come here.

1123
01:11:27,294 --> 01:11:30,286
My neck, man!
Come on, my neck. Get off!

1124
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:36,425
Pretty stupid too, pal.

1125
01:11:37,604 --> 01:11:39,196
<i>Maybe I was stupid</i>.

1126
01:11:39,372 --> 01:11:41,499
<i>That afternoon, my dad gave me proof</i>...

1127
01:11:41,675 --> 01:11:44,041
...<i>that I had inherited this trait from him</i>.

1128
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:46,543
<i>I had just finished Casanova</i>
<i>and had begun reading</i>...

1129
01:11:46,713 --> 01:11:50,479
...<i>the love poems of Robert Browning,</i>
<i>and his wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i>.

1130
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,810
<i>She's the one who wrote:</i>

1131
01:11:51,985 --> 01:11:54,613
''How do l love thee?
Let me count the ways.''

1132
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:56,779
<i>Anyway, it was my parents' anniversary</i>...

1133
01:11:56,957 --> 01:12:00,085
...<i>and my father made the mistake</i>
<i>of getting the wrong gift</i>.

1134
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:09,233
l'm sorry, honey.

1135
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:19,042
<i>My dad tried to salvage the situation</i>
<i>by rushing out to the jewelry store</i>.

1136
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:22,776
<i>But that wasn't enough</i>.

1137
01:12:23,116 --> 01:12:27,177
<i>When he came home,</i>
<i>he was in for a big surprise</i>.

1138
01:12:43,136 --> 01:12:46,071
Honey, come on. Let me in. Please?

1139
01:12:47,808 --> 01:12:50,777
Sweetheart?
l got you another present. See?

1140
01:13:11,898 --> 01:13:13,957
May l join you?

1141
01:13:18,338 --> 01:13:20,203
Guess so.

1142
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:43,421
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>my dad was pretty lame</i>.

1143
01:13:43,964 --> 01:13:46,125
<i>What did it say about me</i>
<i>that my dad was using</i>...

1144
01:13:46,299 --> 01:13:50,167
...<i>my strategy to win Erica</i>
<i>to score points with Mom?</i>

1145
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:56,102
<i>I hoped my dad would have</i>
<i>more luck with my mom</i>...

1146
01:13:56,276 --> 01:13:58,267
...<i>than I was having with Erica</i>.

1147
01:13:58,445 --> 01:14:01,278
.<i>He was beginning to get on my nerves</i>.

1148
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:06,643
You ever tried that one on Mom?

1149
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,515
No.

1150
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,187
How about that?

1151
01:14:13,193 --> 01:14:14,455
No.

1152
01:14:16,396 --> 01:14:19,797
You've been married 1 8 years,
you haven't tried that?

1153
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:23,060
Well, that area's a big mystery to me.

1154
01:14:23,236 --> 01:14:25,431
l've never been able to figure it out.

1155
01:14:25,605 --> 01:14:28,403
Well, no wonder she's so mad at you.

1156
01:14:29,075 --> 01:14:31,236
Do you really think she wants that?

1157
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:35,876
of course she does.
You read what the book says.

1158
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:46,853
Thanks, Peter.

1159
01:15:54,561 --> 01:15:56,529
<i>Jesus Christ</i>.

1160
01:15:56,696 --> 01:16:00,325
<i>Now even my dad was</i>
<i>getting more action than I was</i>.

1161
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:36,692
Hey-ho, Peter.

1162
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:44,502
-What's this?
-This is breakfast.

1163
01:16:48,314 --> 01:16:49,679
But l thought that--

1164
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:52,750
Look, l was all wrong about all this.

1165
01:16:52,919 --> 01:16:54,750
l'm very sorry.

1166
01:16:54,921 --> 01:16:57,481
And here's a copy of the house key.

1167
01:16:57,657 --> 01:17:00,717
You can come back inside
anytime you want.

1168
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:09,230
Thanks.

1169
01:17:09,402 --> 01:17:11,336
And, son...

1170
01:17:13,306 --> 01:17:14,534
...l love you.

1171
01:17:18,211 --> 01:17:20,475
You know the sad man
across the street?

1172
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:24,014
The one who pushes his wife around
in the wheelchair all the time?

1173
01:17:24,184 --> 01:17:28,018
Well, l don't see her
around there anymore.

1174
01:17:28,188 --> 01:17:30,554
Like she's-- She's gone.

1175
01:17:30,723 --> 01:17:34,022
l've been watching him all summer,
and secretly he's been taking things...

1176
01:17:34,194 --> 01:17:36,128
...in and out of the house.

1177
01:17:36,296 --> 01:17:39,197
Wait. So you think he killed his wife?

1178
01:17:39,365 --> 01:17:40,525
Yeah.

1179
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,668
That's bull.

1180
01:17:42,836 --> 01:17:44,201
l don't believe that.

1181
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,598
Yeah?

1182
01:17:45,772 --> 01:17:49,264
Well, why don't you go over there
and check it out.

1183
01:17:49,442 --> 01:17:53,242
Because l got better things to do
than prowl around some guy's back yard.

1184
01:17:53,413 --> 01:17:54,710
l dare you to go.

1185
01:17:54,881 --> 01:17:56,644
oh, l'm not going over there.

1186
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:59,751
-l almost got caught last time.
-l dare you both.

1187
01:18:02,088 --> 01:18:03,555
Look, we'll all go.

1188
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:07,317
<i>So we crossed the street</i>...

1189
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:10,088
...<i>to find out what happened</i>
<i>to the man's wife</i>...

1190
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:13,630
...<i>making sure we didn't get run over</i>
<i>by Mister Mays</i>.

1191
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:17,759
-lt's locked. Come on.
-Erica, wait.

1192
01:18:22,342 --> 01:18:23,934
No, don't open the door. Don't.

1193
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,304
lt's unlocked.

1194
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:33,145
l knew you'd come back.

1195
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:35,947
You wanna see what's inside?

1196
01:18:36,389 --> 01:18:38,380
Wanna see what l've done?

1197
01:18:40,059 --> 01:18:42,186
l'll show you what l've done.

1198
01:18:49,502 --> 01:18:51,970
-No, no!
-No, man!

1199
01:18:58,411 --> 01:19:00,140
You've been waiting all summer long.

1200
01:19:00,313 --> 01:19:02,076
-Just relax.
-No, we haven't.

1201
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:05,949
Let's go, Peter.
Come on! We didn't do anything!

1202
01:19:17,864 --> 01:19:19,297
This.

1203
01:19:19,465 --> 01:19:20,796
This is what l've done.

1204
01:19:20,967 --> 01:19:24,027
You built a swimming pool
in your living room?

1205
01:19:24,204 --> 01:19:26,604
No. Not just a swimming pool.

1206
01:19:29,609 --> 01:19:31,668
l built paradise.

1207
01:19:31,844 --> 01:19:33,744
A tropical...

1208
01:19:33,913 --> 01:19:35,938
...paradise.

1209
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:39,043
Honey?

1210
01:19:40,753 --> 01:19:44,154
-What's going on?
-Nothing, my dear.

1211
01:19:44,324 --> 01:19:46,224
Just some guests.

1212
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:50,122
My wife and l...

1213
01:19:51,531 --> 01:19:56,059
...wanted to go back to Tahiti
for our second honeymoon.

1214
01:19:57,604 --> 01:19:59,231
But then...

1215
01:19:59,872 --> 01:20:02,033
...she got so sick.

1216
01:20:03,643 --> 01:20:07,010
She really loved the water, you see.

1217
01:20:08,681 --> 01:20:12,139
l wanted to build a pool
in our back yard...

1218
01:20:13,386 --> 01:20:17,049
...but the city wouldn't give me
the permit in time.

1219
01:20:18,591 --> 01:20:19,853
So...

1220
01:20:20,493 --> 01:20:23,121
...l built it here.

1221
01:20:23,763 --> 01:20:25,321
ln secret.

1222
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:28,394
For her.

1223
01:20:29,736 --> 01:20:32,261
So that my love and l...

1224
01:20:33,406 --> 01:20:36,136
...can go back to paradise.

1225
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,174
You won't tell anyone, will you?

1228
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,107
Hi.

1229
01:21:09,976 --> 01:21:11,409
Hi.

1230
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:14,112
So listen...

1231
01:21:14,547 --> 01:21:16,481
...l'm leaving tomorrow.

1232
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:19,809
Where you going?

1233
01:21:20,687 --> 01:21:23,178
You're not gonna believe this...

1234
01:21:23,823 --> 01:21:26,291
...but l decided l'm gonna go to college.

1235
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,158
Right. Good.

1236
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:32,355
Erica's leaving for college too.

1237
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:36,798
Where is she?

1238
01:21:36,969 --> 01:21:39,938
She's with Nick. He broke his leg.

1239
01:21:40,106 --> 01:21:42,097
-Too bad.
-Yeah.

1240
01:21:42,275 --> 01:21:43,936
Lost his football scholarship.

1241
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:47,011
Like l said, too bad.

1242
01:21:51,351 --> 01:21:55,151
So l guess l won't be seeing you around.

1243
01:21:56,122 --> 01:21:58,090
No, no.

1244
01:21:58,257 --> 01:21:59,918
l guess not.

1245
01:22:03,463 --> 01:22:05,158
Peter, listen.

1246
01:22:06,466 --> 01:22:08,991
l was kind of hoping that...

1247
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:12,001
...we could spend
my last day here together.

1248
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:15,572
Elliot's having this party and l thought,
you know, maybe we could go.

1249
01:22:17,076 --> 01:22:19,237
Sounds good.

1250
01:22:19,712 --> 01:22:22,704
But what if Erica, you know...?

1251
01:22:22,882 --> 01:22:24,577
Erica.

1252
01:22:25,184 --> 01:22:27,982
Well, l'll-- l'll see you.

1253
01:22:33,793 --> 01:22:35,385
Screw Erica.

1254
01:22:38,264 --> 01:22:39,492
What?

1255
01:22:39,665 --> 01:22:43,192
l said, screw Erica.

1256
01:22:44,404 --> 01:22:48,397
l mean, if she's not willing to give me
a chance by now, then she's nuts.

1257
01:22:48,574 --> 01:22:52,442
No other man would go through
what l did for her.

1258
01:22:53,012 --> 01:22:56,209
lf that love isn't good enough for her,
well, so be it.

1259
01:22:56,382 --> 01:22:58,475
l mean, there are plenty of other...

1260
01:22:58,651 --> 01:23:02,451
...beautiful, mature women
that want me.

1261
01:23:03,022 --> 01:23:07,152
l even passed up a night
with Ms. Lewis for Erica.

1262
01:23:07,727 --> 01:23:10,093
You passed up Melon-Breast Lewis?

1263
01:23:10,263 --> 01:23:14,063
lf she doesn't love me by now,
then l don't love her.

1264
01:23:14,233 --> 01:23:18,135
Besides, she even thinks
Roger Moore is the best James Bond.

1265
01:23:20,506 --> 01:23:23,031
-Come on. Let's go.
-All right.

1266
01:23:25,311 --> 01:23:30,248
So listen. Did l tell you l revised
my theory on self-sufficiency?

1267
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,941
l'm against it now. lt's a little lonely.

1268
01:23:36,989 --> 01:23:38,217
Peter?

1269
01:23:38,391 --> 01:23:41,258
Peter, l need to talk to you.

1270
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:43,590

1271
01:23:49,769 --> 01:23:51,361
Peter?

1272
01:24:12,992 --> 01:24:15,153
-Hi, Peter.
-Hi, Ms. Lewis.

1273
01:24:15,962 --> 01:24:17,953
What have you boys been up to?

1274
01:24:19,665 --> 01:24:22,463
Well, we just got back from a party.

1275
01:24:22,635 --> 01:24:27,971
Everybody's going off for college,
so it was the last hurrah.

1276
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,131
Sounds like fun.

1277
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:35,542
Would you boys like to come in
for a cup of hot cocoa?

1278
01:24:39,085 --> 01:24:40,416
No, thanks.
