1
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,723
Great Jormungand!

2
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:43,476
Son of Loki!

3
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:48,689
Father of the serpent world, I humbly give

4
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,691
this gift...

5
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,194
of royal blood.

6
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,240
And I ask you
the safe keeping of Midgard.

7
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:02,870
The human world that you hold in your embrace!

8
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,747
Father, please!

9
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:05,623
Silence.

10
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:17,551
Don't be afraid, my child.

11
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,764
Make our clan proud.

12
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,106
Father!

13
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:34,026
I don't want to die, father!

14
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,181
Forgive me.

15
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:10,521
There is nothing to forgive, my king.
We have no choice.

16
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,130
I admit defeat.

17
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:43,632
After all these years,
you've never beaten me.

18
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,177
Because you're the better rider.

19
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,345
No true warrior would ever admit that.

20
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,349
Come...

21
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:55,478
I need to show you something incredible.

22
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:56,771
We have to return.

23
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,856
We will, it's right there.

24
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:13,954
What do you think?

25
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,501
Of this, a pole without banner?

26
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,504
Be serious, Tasya.

27
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,970
I'm telling you this is important.

28
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,849
With this pole,
I can attract lightning.

29
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:40,147
So you are saying this metal pole
you've build with your own hands

30
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,525
is going to steal the lightning of our Gods?

31
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:46,028
Not just any God.
The mighty Thor.

32
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:49,156
The lightning from
his hammer is attracted to metal.

33
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:52,368
I've seen it... I felt it...

34
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:55,162
And I will learn how to control it.

35
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,376
And Thor knows what you intend, Erick.

36
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:03,671
He will piss on us in his anger.

37
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:11,345
You will learn how to control 
the lightning, of this I am sure.

38
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,848
But we're about to get wet.

39
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,144
It's happening!

40
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,397
It's just a storm, Erick!

41
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:51,719
Here.

42
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:55,765
This is for you.
Don't be frightened, it's okay.

43
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:02,271
It's warm.

44
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,523
The lightning heat.

45
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,781
I can not accept this gift from you.

46
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:14,116
Of course you can, we're friends.

47
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:19,914
I am betrothed to Wolven.
Only he can give gifts from now.

48
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,959
Tasya...

49
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,338
I don't want you to marry him.

50
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:32,426
Our marriage tomorrow will secure a truce 
between our clan and the Hermod.

51
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:36,097
Even a bracelet blessed by the Gods
can not change my mind.

52
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:37,723
You don't know him.

53
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,267
I don't need to know him.

54
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,646
It's my
duty to become his wife.

55
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:49,985
Wolven has arrived.

56
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:51,487
You don't have to go.

57
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:52,905
What?

58
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,824
I thought you and me...

59
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,325
Erick...

60
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,835
We are meant to be together we can live here!

61
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:09,880
Stop it, I don't want 
to hear you like that anymore.

62
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:13,509
Then you better go home and chieftain
before he loses his temper!

63
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:26,105
You need to grow up, Erick!

64
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:50,421
- Where's the princess?
- She's out riding, my lord.

65
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,675
Just today.

66
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,427
There he is!

67
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,430
Be welcome, Lord Wolven.

68
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:46,310
This is a great honor
for my family and for my people.

69
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,035
King Orn.

70
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:05,329
I hope you and your family
are well.

71
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:08,833
Yes, thank you. And I trust
you journey was without incident?

72
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,837
without incident. But my men are 
tired and hungry. Where is Tasya?

73
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:16,382
She has been preparing for you.

74
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,844
And not a moment too late.

75
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:41,365
Sorry, Father.

76
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,701
She looks very prepared.

77
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,579
I'm sorry if my appearance displeases you.

78
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:50,166
No... it's actually to my liking.

79
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,047
Tonight we feast and welcome.

80
00:12:57,214 --> 00:13:00,842
And tomorrow, we feast 
and celebrate the wedding...

81
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,721
that will unite our clans.
Please enter.

82
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,562
A toast!

83
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:57,690
To the most beautiful bride in the land!

84
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,318
A bride so perfect...

85
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,571
that Odin himself
looks down on me and envy.

86
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,074
Hear! Hear!

87
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,288
Rise a glass!

88
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,045
To my daughter...

89
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:23,466
And to lord  Wolven, a brave and mighty warrior

90
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,511
that will soon be like a son to me!

91
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,266
With this union

92
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:34,269
the blood spill between the Barok

93
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,147
and the Hermod clans
shall be forgiven!

94
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:42,819
Past battles shall be forgotten!

95
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:48,199
And peace shall reign forever!

96
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:06,926
If he hurts her, I will splay 
him open with my bare hands...

97
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:09,179
and throw his entrails to ravens.

98
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:12,640
Idiot!

99
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,392
That could be a problem.

100
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:16,394
Why is that?

101
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:18,563
Are you blind?

102
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,440
Look at him.

103
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,109
He's bigger,

104
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:25,779
stronger...

105
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:29,240
...better trained than you.

106
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,994
It would be your entrails to 
feed the ravens, my friend.

107
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:34,537
I'm serious, Hild.

108
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,750
If he hurts her, I'll kill him.

109
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,753
I think you love her.

110
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,177
Maybe I do.

111
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,388
She belongs to him.

112
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,390
Let her go.

113
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:06,653
And now some entertainment!
What about skull breaking?

114
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:11,616
10 gold pieces to the man that 
beats my strongest warrior!

115
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,629
Is there anyone here man enough 
to take on Stompir?

116
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,098
To battle!

117
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,308
Go!

118
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:41,896
You're the strongest, Stompir!

119
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:50,363
Advance!

120
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:52,949
Kill him!

121
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,765
We have any other challengers?

122
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,656
Oh, Stompir!

123
00:17:58,598 --> 00:17:59,933
Well done, Stompir!

124
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:03,186
You have proven once gain why 
the warriors of the Hermod clan

125
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,980
are the greatest in all of Midgard!

126
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:11,236
No one comes 
even close to you, Stompir.

127
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:17,534
Lord Wolven!

128
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,954
The match is not over.

129
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,916
I'll send your fleabag to the ground...

130
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,670
And I'll stomp on his belly!

131
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,050
So be it!

132
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:38,221
Prepare to have your belly 
stomped on by this mud-worm.

133
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:40,473
He's just a little boy!

134
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:45,228
Erick, he'll rip you apart.

135
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:48,148
The bigger the tree,
the harder the fall.

136
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:20,513
Who are you?

137
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:23,433
I am Erick the Blessed.

138
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,560
The Blessed?

139
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:29,606
Who could grant such a title
a mere peasant boy?

140
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:32,275
- Perhaps I'll tell you another time.
- Perhaps you'll tell me now.

141
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:39,616
When Erick was 10, he was struck by 
lightning while playing with a sword.

142
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:44,871
His hair was burned as his hands and 
feet but he was blessed he lived.

143
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:48,416
His father was taken aim on him 
as Thor had reached down,

144
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,628
touched him and spared his life.

145
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,725
A brainless boy
chased too close to a fire,

146
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:09,145
convinces an entire clan
he has been touched by a god?

147
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:14,526
We believed him then,
and we believe him now.

148
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:21,449
You surprise me, Lord Orn,
and you disappoint me.

149
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:22,492
Come!

150
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:25,036
Stay and drink with us, 
Erick the Fool.

151
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,956
Entertain us with 
more of your childhood tales!

152
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:33,211
It is miffed!

153
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:52,647
Tasya will be disappointed if 
you don't attend her wedding.

154
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,316
I am not going, father.

155
00:20:56,776 --> 00:21:00,238
You were once childhood friends 
but you are no longer children.

156
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,824
Her choices are none of your concern.

157
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:06,995
I love her and I always will.

158
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,252
Always is a long time, my son.

159
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:18,840
It's too long to live without
a soul mate by your side.

160
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,182
If you really love her...

161
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:31,227
You will realize she must do
this for the kingdom.

162
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,439
I've been thinking, father...

163
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:37,525
If I increase the heat of the forge

164
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,778
you can make a lighter metal.

165
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,071
And a sharper, stronger sword.

166
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:45,450
The bellows can't be pumped faster, 
it's beyond human strength.

167
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:48,870
If the charcoal is
super-heated by the lightning?

168
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:51,289
It would be denser and stronger.

169
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:55,251
No, you wish too much.
The Lightning...

170
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:57,629
belongs to the gods.

171
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:00,340
Maybe, but maybe not.

172
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:02,300
Be careful, my son.

173
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,719
If you try to take
what is not yours,

174
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:07,764
no good will come of it.

175
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:45,802
I feel it too.

176
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:51,808
The great Jormungand is restless.

177
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,703
- That was impressive!
- My aim or the bow?

178
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,248
Both. Your skills of the bow 
are not rusty as the helmet.

179
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:17,584
But this appears to massative!

180
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,294
Maybe I should make you one.

181
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:22,922
Good. Maybe I start shooting things 
we can eat because I'm starving!

182
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:24,174
So you keep saying.

183
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:25,759
You have been pigheaded, Erick!

184
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,261
I'm not stopping you.
Go to the feast!

185
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:30,513
- You are sure?
- Yes, go!

186
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,892
Fill your belly and get stinky drunk
toasting the happy newlyweds!

187
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,102
Okay.

188
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,065
I am going.

189
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,740
It's only for the food!

190
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:51,910
Be back at sunset!

191
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:59,334
It is not too late if 
you wanna make a run for it.

192
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:03,129
I've been stripped from my weapons,
not my title. Be calm, my friend.

193
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,841
Still, my king, my lord, 
my friend in battle...

194
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:09,511
As beautiful as she is,
I'm just saying...

195
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:11,387
Enough! I want this!

196
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,390
I want her.

197
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,379
- Watch there! 
- Kill him!

198
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:09,297
The royal house of the Barok clan...

199
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,299
welcomes King Wolven

200
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,260
into its family.

201
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,602
I call upon the goddess Freya

202
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:26,564
to bind this union with love...

203
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:36,741
Her brother, Freyr...

204
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,121
to bless this union
with many children...

205
00:26:57,387 --> 00:26:58,346
In the Norns...

206
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:00,265
Urd...

207
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:04,436
Verdandi and Skuld to weave around

208
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,187
the King Wolven...

209
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:08,648
and Princess Tasya.

210
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,402
A destiny rich in good health...

211
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:15,071
...and prosperity.

212
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:20,618
Take this ring and with it,
my promise to love...

213
00:27:20,952 --> 00:27:22,745
and protect you always.

214
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:41,598
- Take the princess!
- No, I fight with my people.

215
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,516
- Take her out of here!
- You are not my husband!

216
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:44,809
Do as I say!

217
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,375
They need us!
Let me go!

218
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,089
Lord Wolven has given his orders.
You must be taken to safety.

219
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:08,560
Tasya? Where is she?

220
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,520
To my men.
They fled with the horses!

221
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:19,696
- Where is she?
- Maybe she fled.

222
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:22,115
No, she is a fighter.

223
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:26,494
They have taken her.

224
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:30,331
The raiders...
I know where they landed.

225
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:40,300
Tasya! Tasya!

226
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,888
We must get to the boats! 
We must follow them!

227
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:51,269
They burnt our boats.

228
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:14,125
Where were you?

229
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,919
I was fighting!

230
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:19,005
I was killing everyone!

231
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:21,091
Father?

232
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,134
I'm okay and Tasya?

233
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:26,054
She is gone.
I think they came for her.

234
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:27,263
Why?

235
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,890
I don't know.

236
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:36,064
What is that?

237
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,067
A mark of Volsung clan.

238
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:45,156
To wage a war for land or 
treasure or revenge...

239
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,575
These things I understand.

240
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,786
But why risk
so much for a woman?

241
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:52,914
Not any woman.
The Volsung worship

242
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:56,418
the Jormungand, the great serpent.
Every 100 seasons

243
00:30:56,709 --> 00:31:00,672
they sacrifice the King's daughter,
a princess of pure Nors blood.

244
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:02,674
I know this story.

245
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:04,592
But Tasya is not of
their royal bloodline.

246
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:06,761
If their king only has sons...

247
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:09,681
They steal a princess from another clan.

248
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:13,726
We must build a boat and 
sail for the Volsung island.

249
00:31:14,018 --> 00:31:16,271
Tasya will be dead before 
we have taken into the water.

250
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,606
- Greylock!
- Who?

251
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,402
Greylock, the fisherman.
He lives half a day's ride from here.

252
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:25,613
He is a recluse for 
a reason, remember?

253
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:27,699
Take me to him.

254
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:44,132
Blood Axe, Skull Cleaver,
Igmar the Impaler...

255
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:48,136
I don't know who are more afraid
of Greylock or them.

256
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:51,765
Relax, my friend,
we're fighting on the same side now.

257
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:55,059
The wedding vows didn't take place,
there is no truce between our clans.

258
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,603
They didn't wed?

259
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,229
I thought you knew.

260
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,522
I had no idea.

261
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:03,651
Well, you do now. Watch your back.
Stompir wants to skin you alive.

262
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:48,488
Tell me about this Greylock.

263
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:50,907
There is not much to tell.

264
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:53,451
He trades his fish in the village.

265
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:56,871
He built that boat many years ago,
no one knows why.

266
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,083
He has a son that no one sees.

267
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,335
And he hates people.

268
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,671
And too many blows to the head.

269
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,297
Maybe he has his reasons.

270
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:09,759
If we can't find him,
we take his boat.

271
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,345
Your men should be careful.

272
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,305
Of a hermit?

273
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:22,689
What traps are these?

274
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:25,150
Traps laid by 
a man defending his home.

275
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:29,362
Greylock!

276
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,324
It's me, Erick!
The son of Lars, the blacksmith!

277
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,452
And Hild son of Lorimar!

278
00:33:35,618 --> 00:33:37,412
We come seeking your help!

279
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,122
Who are you with?

280
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:42,750
Friends!

281
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,793
Order your men to lower their weapons.

282
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,503
You heard him.

283
00:33:52,134 --> 00:33:55,846
I knew it, on too
blows on the head!

284
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:05,981
Erick the Blessed,
what brings you here?

285
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:08,692
Our village was attacked.

286
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:10,652
King Orn is dead...

287
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:13,614
And our princess Tasya taken.

288
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:15,032
By whom?

289
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:16,366
The Volsung.

290
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:18,660
I can't help!

291
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:22,081
- Father, maybe we should listen.
- You heard me.

292
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:24,750
I am King Wolven,
of the Hermod clan.

293
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:28,462
I am not afraid of the Volsung.
We have come for your boat.

294
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:33,801
What is that I smell?
Sheep's urine!

295
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,805
You dare to
disrespect me, old man?

296
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,057
I dare speak what I think.

297
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:43,811
Why are you
riding with our enemy?

298
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,107
He is betrothed to Tasya.

299
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:51,193
Their union will bring peace
to our clans.

300
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:56,740
I doubt it.

301
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:04,039
I will offer you a meal in return for 
your telling of the attack, and then you...

302
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:07,543
will get off my land!

303
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,222
Your friend is
close getting hung from his intestines.

304
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:22,391
You are not the first to make that thread.

305
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:25,144
And you certainly won't be the last!

306
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:48,542
King Orn was a good man.

307
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:53,088
This is a sad day for
the Barok clan.

308
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:56,633
We can rescue the princess
if you lend us the boat.

309
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,763
If the Volsung failed to appease 
the serpent with this sacrifice

310
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,556
we are all doomed.

311
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:08,020
A false story they tell to cause
fear in the hearts of the ignorant.

312
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:12,900
The Midgard serpent will leave the ocean...

313
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:16,570
...turn into a dragon and fly to Asgard.

314
00:36:16,737 --> 00:36:19,490
It will start Ragnarok,

315
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,075
the final battle of the gods...

316
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:25,287
The world will end.

317
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:34,588
It's best you don't interfere.

318
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:43,597
We will take your boat, old man.

319
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:45,974
If you interfere,

320
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:50,312
I will cut off your fingers one at 
a time until your hands are useless!

321
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:51,855
Father...

322
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:55,400
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

323
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,029
I am a Barok.

324
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:02,533
I do not take orders from you.

325
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,373
Please, Wolven!

326
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,625
I beg you, don't hurt my father!

327
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:20,426
Fine.

328
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:22,803
Take the boat.

329
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:26,807
Take whatever you need.

330
00:37:26,974 --> 00:37:28,684
It's the least I can do

331
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:32,312
to make the journey to your
death an easy one.

332
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:07,264
Hey, fishmonger!

333
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:10,517
Do all your boat leak like this?

334
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,770
Rain water!

335
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:15,355
It's perfectly seaworthy!

336
00:38:26,658 --> 00:38:28,994
Wait!
I want to come with you!

337
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:31,330
- I think not, child.
- I'm not a child!

338
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:33,248
Are you sure about that, 
you sound like one.

339
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,833
Oh, you both sound like children.

340
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,795
I've seen 16 summers.
I make my own decisions.

341
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:40,714
- I'm coming with you.
- This isn't a game, we could be sailing to death.

342
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,257
Not if I navigate.

343
00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:44,301
Erick can read the stars.
We don't need you!

344
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:45,844
I was born on that boat.

345
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:48,388
They won't even know we're there.

346
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:51,600
I was with my father
when he saw the serpent.

347
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:54,853
The island was close.
I can take you there.

348
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:56,814
We'll find on our own.

349
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:59,066
You can save us time.

350
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,902
Get the provisions you need
and make it fast.
 
351
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:07,282
How can I explain that to our leader?

352
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:11,453
The truth. We just hired 
the best navigator in the land.

353
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:21,505
A word with you... 
there is truth in the legend.

354
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,092
I have seen the monster they worship.

355
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,718
You have?

356
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:28,095
Trust me.

357
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:29,471
It's real?

358
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:32,349
Your princess is not worth it.

359
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:35,811
We believe she is.

360
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:40,399
May your death be worthy 
of a Barok warrior!

361
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,750
Mani!

362
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,086
Mani!

363
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:07,468
Thor, son of Odin...

364
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:11,680
protector of Midgard and all human kind...

365
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:16,018
Keep my child safe
from the serpent,

366
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:20,230
the creature who threatens to destroy us all.

367
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:36,121
Row! Come on!

368
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,708
Pull your back into it, men!

369
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:56,016
Hush, drink.

370
00:40:58,477 --> 00:40:59,770
Drink!

371
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,569
I was worried if you were going to wake up.

372
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:14,910
Where are you taking me?

373
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:17,162
We canoe to the Volsung clan.

374
00:41:17,496 --> 00:41:18,872
Through your death,

375
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:21,208
the world will continue to live.

376
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:24,128
You should be proud to be chosen.

377
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:44,690
We must be careful, my king.

378
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:49,027
Both the Barok and the Hermod 
clans will come for her.

379
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:59,204
These clans share a past of bloodshed.

380
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:03,876
They dislike and distrust each other.

381
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:06,670
Their fleets have been destroyed.

382
00:42:09,715 --> 00:42:12,843
They can not mount an attack.

383
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,599
Just one boat with determined warriors...

384
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:21,435
Against me?

385
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:25,898
Against the Volsung clan?

386
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:30,068
Against the great Jormungand?

387
00:42:32,696 --> 00:42:35,532
They would never interfere.

388
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,244
Possibly, but we should 
still take precautions.

389
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:43,582
Why does this concern you?

390
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:46,376
- Because I've seen the serpent.
- And?

391
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:50,464
It's restless...
more so than ever before.

392
00:42:53,425 --> 00:42:56,553
You mistake restless for excited.

393
00:42:57,888 --> 00:43:01,934
Your immortality may have
given you experience...

394
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:07,064
But only kings have wisdom.

395
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:16,323
Enough of your obstinate words. 
Leave me now!

396
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,909
As You wish.

397
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:34,049
Pull harder, you scoundrels!
We have a princess to rescue!

398
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:46,270
Boy, give them water!

399
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,696
You're so small for your age.
You're sure you have seen 16 summers?

400
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:57,948
Of course I'm sure.

401
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:06,206
The runt of a litter is
good for nothing. You're a runt, Mani?

402
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:08,542
I take care of myself.

403
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:12,504
What do you think, Erick?
Shall we throw this good-for-nothing overboard?

404
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,382
I would want to tell Greylock
we drowned his bare cub!

405
00:44:15,674 --> 00:44:18,969
Enough talk or I throw 
you both over board!

406
00:44:19,595 --> 00:44:21,847
Who is Potan the bear now?!

407
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:30,481
Come on!

408
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:34,485
Move it!

409
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,998
We lost sight of the Star in the North.

410
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:53,629
The sail is full of the south wind.
We're heading in the right direction.

411
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,507
Then all is well.

412
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:02,137
Maybe not.

413
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:04,723
There's a big storm coming.

414
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,558
You know this about?

415
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:09,520
I study storms.

416
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:11,605
What reason?

417
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,566
To capture the heat of Thor's lightning.

418
00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:16,693
Seriously?

419
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,737
Yes, seriously!

420
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:21,115
You think I'm a fool?

421
00:45:22,574 --> 00:45:25,869
If that was what I thought,
I wouldn't be on this journey.

422
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:32,418
I was a young child when  I saw the serpent.

423
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:35,963
We were fishing and...

424
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:38,507
a fierce storm overtook us.

425
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:42,428
When the wind died,
we could see the island of the Volsung.

426
00:45:43,095 --> 00:45:46,056
It breached, right before the boat...

427
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:51,061
Jormungand, son of Loki.

428
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:54,148
What did you do?

429
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:59,027
Greylock hit him with an oar
and it disappeared beneath the waves.

430
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:03,282
A whale becomes a serpent in the eyes of a child.

431
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:05,325
And another legend is born.

432
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:09,204
The storm will be here soon.

433
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,013
Welcome, Princess Tasya,

434
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:29,433
daughter of King Orn
of the Barok clan.

435
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:34,188
I hope your journey was not too uncomfortable.

436
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,939
Uncomfortable?

437
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:40,068
You attacked my people
and abducted me on my wedding day.

438
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,655
Unfortunately,
the Gods have only blessed me with sons...

439
00:46:44,907 --> 00:46:48,535
And my sister, Astrid, died
an unfortunate death.

440
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,624
That's why you were chosen.

441
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,168
To serve our kingdom.

442
00:46:58,087 --> 00:47:01,006
I don't care
what I was chosen for.

443
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:03,717
I would rather die than serve you.

444
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,679
You won't be serving me, Tasya.

445
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:10,516
You will be serving everyone.

446
00:47:11,183 --> 00:47:13,602
Including your own people.

447
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,730
I don't understand.

448
00:47:17,856 --> 00:47:19,566
It's simple.

449
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:24,863
I'm in need of a daughter to
be sacrificed to the great Jormungand,

450
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,365
son of Loki,

451
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,660
Father of the Serpent world.

452
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:31,829
You are my choice.

453
00:47:32,162 --> 00:47:34,832
Just as my ancestors chose before me.

454
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:38,043
I'm not your daughter!

455
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:42,548
No... you are not.

456
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,885
But for the sake of the Midgard world,

457
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:49,596
and for all human kind, I hope...

458
00:47:50,556 --> 00:47:52,266
you will do.

459
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:58,230
My people will come looking for me.

460
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:01,525
Take the princess to her room.

461
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:04,445
And see that she 
is bathed and fed.

462
00:48:09,158 --> 00:48:11,493
I'll slit her throat
if you don't release me.

463
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:17,666
If this is how you choose 
to behave then

464
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,878
you will spend your stay in the dungeon.

465
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,881
Until the day of the sacrifice.

466
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:27,676
Stop her, guards!

467
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:30,721
She is going to escape!

468
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:44,318
You have nowhere to go.

469
00:48:44,777 --> 00:48:47,112
Accept your fate.

470
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:32,616
Attach the sail!
Pull in the oars!

471
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:34,660
Hold on!

472
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,537
How far to the island?

473
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:39,581
Right ahead! We are close!

474
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:43,043
Too close!
Those rocks will tear us apart!

475
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:49,007
We must jump, move it!

476
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,760
Jump! Jump! Jump!

477
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:12,156
How long have you been here?

478
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:16,118
I lost counting the days
a long time ago.

479
00:50:29,715 --> 00:50:31,675
You're a pretty thing.

480
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:33,844
What did you do to offend the king?

481
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:35,220
Nothing.

482
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:40,726
Apparently I'm to be sacrificed to 
the Midgard serpent at noon today.

483
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:44,897
You are
a princess of royal blood?

484
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:48,066
Yes... I am.

485
00:50:48,484 --> 00:50:51,779
Then you have been sent to save us.

486
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:55,657
I was not send,
I was kidnapped.

487
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:59,286
The only person I feel 
like saving now, is myself.

488
00:50:59,453 --> 00:51:02,456
No, no, no... your death

489
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:05,000
will keep Midgard from destruction.

490
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:07,127
It's a noble way to die.

491
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:08,629
You think so?

492
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:12,341
Well, how about this...
You clean you up...

493
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:16,804
Put you in my dress and you can die
a noble death in my place.

494
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:32,402
I'll gladly take your place.

495
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:37,116
Perhaps the inners of a serpent would 
be a nice change of scenery.

496
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:43,122
You have nothing to complain about.

497
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:34,631
You're okay?

498
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:36,049
Just a little bit water along.

499
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:37,968
Is this the island of Volsung?

500
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,678
That's what Mani said.

501
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:40,929
Mani!

502
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:42,890
We lost him!

503
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:44,224
He was useless.

504
00:52:44,516 --> 00:52:46,602
Three of my warriors are dead.

505
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:50,439
And you two are still alive.
Why do the gods this to me?

506
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:52,024
I can ask the same question.

507
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,525
Do not push me, boy!

508
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:57,070
Or you'll wish
you were drowned with others!

509
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:08,290
Look what the ocean has
coughed up on our shore.

510
00:53:08,457 --> 00:53:10,876
A little drowned rat.

511
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:25,599
Where do you come from, little rat?

512
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:32,564
After him!

513
00:53:34,316 --> 00:53:37,236
If my princess dies, I'll rip out 
your heart and feed it to the fishes!

514
00:53:37,402 --> 00:53:39,113
Your princess?

515
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:42,699
If I am not mistaken,
Tasya is of the Barok clan.

516
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:44,159
Erick...

517
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:47,746
You dare to disrespect me?

518
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:51,542
I'm simply pointing out the union was interrupted.

519
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:53,585
Barok Sale!

520
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:55,045
Help!

521
00:54:19,695 --> 00:54:21,947
Stand up!

522
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,031
Move!

523
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:25,992
It seems we have a new friend.

524
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,539
Take us to princess Tasya,

525
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:33,624
or prepare to meet your death.

526
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:36,711
I can not.

527
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,552
Oh, I think you can.

528
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:48,765
Stompir, remove his limbs!

529
00:54:49,348 --> 00:54:50,349
We need him!

530
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:53,811
This Volsung sword is dull, my lord.

531
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:56,522
Pity it won't be a clean death.

532
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,608
Hack away!

533
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:00,777
Wait! Wait!

534
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:05,323
I'll take you to her.

535
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,617
Tie up his hands!

536
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:08,868
That worked.

537
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:12,497
Boy, take their water skins!

538
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,710
Our quest will continue after all!

539
00:55:23,382 --> 00:55:25,093
When is the sacrifice?

540
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:27,303
Tomorrow on the full sun.

541
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:28,763
Then we will tracking in the night.

542
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:31,641
No one travels
into this forest at night.

543
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:32,683
Why?

544
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:35,228
Wolves.

545
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,313
I'm afraid of no dogs.

546
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:40,233
Then you will be their first meal.

547
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:42,944
These are no ordinary wolves.

548
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:45,655
All men fear them...

549
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,448
except the Kings druid.

550
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,950
He controls them?

551
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:50,701
They respect him.

552
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:55,873
Some say these wolves are the 
offspring of Fenrir himself.

553
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:57,333
You are stealing time.

554
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:02,046
I am not, the only thing that will 
save us this night is a campfire.

555
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:04,298
What about our torches?

556
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:06,092
Not big enough.

557
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:10,096
Perhaps we shouldn't risk it, milord.

558
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:15,226
We need a rest.
Find a clearing for a campfire.

559
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,078
I'll go and get us some water.

560
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:38,124
Be quick and get us 
some more firewood.

561
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:44,714
I will help. Hild?

562
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:47,008
No, I'll tend the fish.

563
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:49,677
I keep an eye on our
new friends there.

564
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:56,267
I'll be back soon.

565
00:57:03,107 --> 00:57:04,233
I am wary.

566
00:57:28,257 --> 00:57:29,175
Mani?

567
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,552
Why are you following me?

568
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:33,304
I wasn't. I...

569
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:36,557
- You're a girl.
- So?

570
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,476
So I don't understand.

571
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:40,520
- Understand what?
- Why you're a girl.

572
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:42,146
Or...

573
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:44,565
Why you pretended to be a boy? 
I mean...

574
00:57:44,857 --> 00:57:47,443
Stop it!
Look, Greylock was keeping me hidden

575
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,695
and the easiest way was for mw to be a boy.

576
00:57:50,238 --> 00:57:51,781
But why?

577
00:57:55,618 --> 00:57:58,996
If I tell you, make a promise
that you keep my secret.

578
00:57:59,163 --> 00:58:00,289
I will.

579
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:02,333
Erick!

580
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,502
Help me put my hat on.

581
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:09,340
Erick, if you're hungry,
now is the time to eat!

582
00:58:15,513 --> 00:58:19,058
You need to come back to the fire. Stompir
is looking at me like a fresh deer meat.

583
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:20,560
Come on!

584
00:58:26,357 --> 00:58:28,067
Wonderful company, you two!

585
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:29,902
- Watch you tongue, boy!
- Hey!

586
00:58:30,194 --> 00:58:33,823
Stop peckering!
Just keeps your eyes open and your blade closed!

587
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,325
- He's a nightmare!
- Stop it!

588
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:55,303
Come on!

589
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:57,597
Get up!

590
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,353
Go on!

591
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:05,855
Move it!

592
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:36,385
Warriors, men and children, dawn is upon us.
We are running out of time, move!

593
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:39,180
It's a good day for a warrior's death.

594
00:59:39,347 --> 00:59:40,973
Speak for yourself.

595
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:54,112
Morning!

596
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:56,614
Walk!

597
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:22,306
My people will destroy you for this.

598
01:00:23,182 --> 01:00:25,518
They will cut you down...

599
01:00:26,018 --> 01:00:30,606
...your husbands,
your wives and your children...

600
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:33,776
They will feed you all to the serpent

601
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:37,321
and then they will burn 
the Volsung island to ashes!

602
01:00:37,697 --> 01:00:41,743
Be calm, my princess,
it will all be over soon.

603
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:55,548
We have visitors.

604
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,426
Haunt them, my friends.

605
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:14,358
How much longer?

606
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,110
We're close.

607
01:01:33,377 --> 01:01:35,171
The wolves are following us.

608
01:01:35,797 --> 01:01:38,299
If they are,
it only means one thing.

609
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:40,051
Means what?

610
01:01:40,384 --> 01:01:42,887
The Druid knows you're here.

611
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:44,472
Help!

612
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,182
Blood Axe!

613
01:01:58,403 --> 01:01:59,320
There!

614
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:00,863
- I see it!
- It's here.

615
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:03,658
My blade will cut it out to size!

616
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,247
We must run.

617
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:10,581
There are six of us!

618
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:12,083
Seven of us!

619
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,334
Get behind me, Mani!

620
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:31,936
If we survive this,
remind me to kill Wolven.

621
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:34,188
My pleasure. I'll help you!

622
01:02:58,212 --> 01:02:58,838
No!

623
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:05,261
Leave them,
I need to save the princess.

624
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,931
I said, leave them!

625
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,960
Odin has seen your courage, Hild.

626
01:03:38,127 --> 01:03:41,255
And he awaits your arrival in Valhalla.

627
01:03:41,923 --> 01:03:43,883
Goodbye, my friend.

628
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:46,344
Until we meet again.

629
01:03:53,976 --> 01:03:55,353
I can't.

630
01:03:58,147 --> 01:04:00,233
My father made him this.

631
01:04:00,817 --> 01:04:02,985
It is a strong sword.

632
01:04:03,986 --> 01:04:05,613
Hild would've want you to have it.

633
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:18,418
We shouldn't have left them.

634
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:21,587
The Barok, they are useless to us.

635
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:23,548
Still...

636
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,885
If we manage to rescue the princess we 
will need a boat. We'll need the rowers.

637
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:30,138
We'll deal with that when we get there.

638
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:32,723
The prisoner said
we were close.

639
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:48,239
Why didn't that wolf attack you?

640
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:49,407
I don't know.

641
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:52,285
It could have ripped out your throat
but he didn't. Tell me, Mani!

642
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,289
I think they protect the royal family.

643
01:04:56,456 --> 01:04:57,665
That doesn't make sense.

644
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:01,043
What does that to have do with you?

645
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:04,505
Sigvat, the Volsung King,
is my true father.

646
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:06,090
What?

647
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:07,842
And your mother?

648
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:09,135
Astrid.

649
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:11,804
His sister.

650
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:15,516
His wives could only give him sons
so he took her in his bed.

651
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:18,811
My mother was pregnant
when she threw herself into the ocean.

652
01:05:35,203 --> 01:05:37,330
The king thought she drowned
but she did not.

653
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:42,001
Greylock found her days later
clinging to a lock.

654
01:05:43,544 --> 01:05:46,756
She gave birth shortly after
and she told him the story.

655
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:51,469
Why did Greylock
hide you as a boy?

656
01:05:51,677 --> 01:05:54,013
My mother died soon after I was born.

657
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,308
He promised her he would protect me
from the Volsung King.

658
01:06:06,943 --> 01:06:08,903
If the Volsung
discover that you're here...

659
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,113
Or Wolven...

660
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:11,906
He would trade you for Tasya.

661
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:14,409
As a Volsung princess
you'd be sacrificed in her place.

662
01:06:14,575 --> 01:06:16,035
It would save her life.

663
01:06:16,202 --> 01:06:17,161
No!

664
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:19,539
There got to be a way to 
save both of you.

665
01:06:19,705 --> 01:06:23,584
My mother and Greylock could not protect me
for what was meant to happen. This my destiny.

666
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,754
It is a legend, a story,
we don't known what true lies in it.

667
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:28,131
It doesn't matter!

668
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:32,593
The attack on your village,
all these dead... it's because of me.

669
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,680
Listen to me,
this is not your fault.

670
01:06:37,098 --> 01:06:38,558
I can give myself to them.

671
01:06:40,685 --> 01:06:44,480
No one is going to be sacrificed
today. That I promise you.

672
01:06:46,107 --> 01:06:49,736
Come on. There has to be a hill,
a perch to see our position.

673
01:07:02,206 --> 01:07:03,708
It's time.

674
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,342
My people are coming for me.

675
01:07:13,593 --> 01:07:16,095
You are right.
They would come for you.

676
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:19,015
And now,
they are all died.

677
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,310
You are lying!

678
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,194
Anything?

679
01:07:31,486 --> 01:07:35,531
I see the water and the top
of the fortress. We are close.

680
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,872
- Don't ever touch me like that again!
- Like what?

681
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,999
Your hands... on my...

682
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:48,461
You were going to fall.
What else was I supposed to do? I'm sorry.

683
01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:50,880
We go this way!

684
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:54,133
I liked you better as a boy.

685
01:07:54,425 --> 01:07:56,511
Hey! You might be needing this!

686
01:07:57,386 --> 01:07:59,639
Great Jormungand...

687
01:07:59,931 --> 01:08:03,559
Son of Loki, father of 
the serpent world...

688
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:08,856
I humble give you this gift of royal blood

689
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:12,860
and ask safe keeping of Midgard,

690
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:17,407
the human world you hold in your embrace.

691
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,249
Don't fight it, girl.

692
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:30,378
If only you could understand
the importance of your sacrifice!

693
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:33,631
Thor, son of Odin, I implore you!

694
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:37,093
Bring down your mighty hammer
on your enemy!

695
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:38,428
Silence!

696
01:08:41,514 --> 01:08:44,642
It is time to call
the Great Jormungand.

697
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:49,856
I spit on
Loki and his son Jormungand!

698
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:10,209
Sound the battle horn!

699
01:09:22,138 --> 01:09:23,431
This way!

700
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:28,644
The ceremony!

701
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:30,396
Come on, it's close!

702
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:43,284
Thor...
hear the cry of your humble servant!

703
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:46,704
Save me!

704
01:09:53,044 --> 01:09:56,422
By all that is sacred in Asgard, 
the serpent does exist.

705
01:09:57,215 --> 01:09:59,300
I hate them snakes.

706
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:01,636
Die a hero, my friend

707
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:04,806
or die a coward
on the end of my sword!

708
01:10:09,852 --> 01:10:10,812
Get them!

709
01:10:13,272 --> 01:10:14,565
Tasya!

710
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,234
Erick!

711
01:10:17,193 --> 01:10:19,278
Untie the other hand, Mani!

712
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,530
Quick!

713
01:11:23,676 --> 01:11:24,969
Get for the boat!

714
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,589
Row! Row for your live!

715
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,981
I knew you would come for me.

716
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:22,443
I would fight Odin and all the gods  
of Asgard if I had to.

717
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:25,196
Nothing was going to 
stand in my way.

718
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:34,038
Looks like your princess is 
your princess no longer.

719
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:37,250
They are not married yet.

720
01:12:38,126 --> 01:12:40,628
Look at them. They are in love.

721
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:45,174
I don't see love.

722
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:49,178
I see a union of convenience.

723
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:51,931
I suppose you don't see anything 
in your fog of jealousy.

724
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:03,568
We are truly heroes of legend!

725
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:06,195
We are the song that will sing 
throughout Midgard for eternity.

726
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:10,324
I could hear it now.

727
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:13,077
How the Hermod
warriors defeat the Volsung

728
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:16,330
who dared to take the princess
from our fearless King Wolven!

729
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:19,542
Legends will be told about us, 
am I right?

730
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:21,961
Indeed you are, my friend.
Indeed you are.

731
01:13:30,178 --> 01:13:33,639
And what of the Barok clan 
and our heroism, King Wolven?

732
01:13:34,432 --> 01:13:37,560
Did we not free the princess
from the altar?

733
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:42,273
Did we not fight the side you
with equal strength and courage?

734
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,818
Equal strength and equal courage?

735
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:47,111
No.

736
01:13:48,988 --> 01:13:53,159
Perhaps not, milord, but do not forget 
the help they provided this day.

737
01:13:55,328 --> 01:13:57,038
You are right, my princess.

738
01:13:57,455 --> 01:14:00,833
Thank you, Erick the Blessed.
Thank you, Mani the Navigator.

739
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:03,544
Your help today will not 
get without reward.

740
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:09,050
The power of the current has changed.
We are near land, king Wolven.

741
01:14:09,342 --> 01:14:13,387
Good, I would welcome
a soft bed, a warm meal

742
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:16,849
and finally, a union
worth fighting for.

743
01:14:29,487 --> 01:14:31,989
It's them. They returned.

744
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,423
Welcome home, son.

745
01:14:56,556 --> 01:14:59,225
We survived, father.
King Sigvat is dead.

746
01:14:59,559 --> 01:15:01,102
And the serpent?

747
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:03,438
No longer a threat.

748
01:15:04,021 --> 01:15:05,647
Where is Hild?

749
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,816
Valhalla.

750
01:15:08,191 --> 01:15:09,901
He died well.

751
01:15:10,068 --> 01:15:12,571
Well, we will drink
in his honor.

752
01:15:12,863 --> 01:15:16,241
You and your son are invited to join us

753
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:18,994
for a meal and a mug
of my best mead.

754
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:22,414
Thank you, Lars,
but Mani is tired.

755
01:15:22,789 --> 01:15:25,375
I'm not tired, father.

756
01:15:30,964 --> 01:15:33,550
Today we rest.

757
01:15:34,259 --> 01:15:37,387
Tomorrow I wed
your princess Tasya.

758
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:41,266
This union will
no longer be a truce between our clans.

759
01:15:42,601 --> 01:15:46,229
With the death of King Orn,
this will be a joining

760
01:15:46,521 --> 01:15:49,066
of two royal households under one king!

761
01:15:49,775 --> 01:15:54,863
I, Wolven the Brave, will rule 
the people of Barok under a firm

762
01:15:55,155 --> 01:15:56,615
and fair hand.

763
01:15:56,948 --> 01:15:59,451
That is my promise.

764
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:02,412
Long live King Wolven!

765
01:16:02,704 --> 01:16:04,873
Long live King Wolven!

766
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:12,714
Without a king, this is not unexpected.

767
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:16,009
Tasya can rule without Wolven at her side.

768
01:16:16,343 --> 01:16:19,888
She has her warriors,
she has the love of her people and...

769
01:16:22,015 --> 01:16:23,308
Erick!

770
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,560
- I got to go to him.
- No!

771
01:16:25,852 --> 01:16:27,646
We need to go home.

772
01:16:28,522 --> 01:16:31,108
The Volsung are no longer 
our concern, father.

773
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:37,155
Come, my offer of mead still stands.

774
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,543
Erick...

775
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:51,920
I need to be alone.

776
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:54,673
Please, listen to me.

777
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,009
There's something I need to tell you.

778
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:01,471
What?
That I am a fool for loving Tasya?

779
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:04,474
That I need to let her go before 
she destroys me?

780
01:17:04,766 --> 01:17:08,228
What, Mani? What could you possibly 
say to me that I don't already know?

781
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,566
It's not the end of the world.

782
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:16,236
Sometimes two people can connect 
when they least expect it.

783
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:17,154
Mani!

784
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:19,072
I'm trying to tell you how I feel.

785
01:17:19,364 --> 01:17:20,115
Mani!

786
01:17:24,828 --> 01:17:26,621
It has come for me.

787
01:17:26,955 --> 01:17:29,040
We have to warn the village.

788
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:34,004
He must have followed us back.

789
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:36,673
Because he still wants a sacrifice.

790
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:40,594
Perhaps this will be the start of 
Ragnarok, the end of our world.

791
01:17:40,886 --> 01:17:43,472
Why hasn't Thor just
destroyed the serpent?

792
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:47,934
He can't cope without
his father power.

793
01:17:48,101 --> 01:17:51,813
It was Odin who banished 
Jormungand to the ocean.

794
01:17:52,105 --> 01:17:56,777
Thor fell in love with a beautiful 
Volsung princess by the name of Bruinhild.

795
01:17:56,943 --> 01:17:59,196
The serpent in a revenge killed her.

796
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:02,407
And threatened to
destroy the entire clan

797
01:18:02,741 --> 01:18:06,119
if the reigning king failed
to sacrifice a daughter.

798
01:18:06,453 --> 01:18:09,039
Thor needs us as 
much as we need him.

799
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:14,628
Skull Cleaver, I need you
to return to Hermod.

800
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:17,047
Assemble our warriors and 
bring them back here.

801
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:19,508
- That's a 2 days ride.
- Not if you take the longboat.

802
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,469
- How do we get past the serpent?
- I'll create a diversion.

803
01:18:22,636 --> 01:18:23,887
- I'm going with him.
- No!

804
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,598
I'll need you to 
take the princess inland.

805
01:18:26,765 --> 01:18:29,017
The serpent has come for me.

806
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:32,521
I will not stand by and watch
more of my people killed.

807
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:37,609
You are not sacrificing yourself.
Not now, not ever.

808
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:43,573
I think I know
a way to destroy it.

809
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:48,412
I understand none of these. 
How can Mani be a Volsung princess?

810
01:18:48,578 --> 01:18:50,664
It's proved she is. Mani...

811
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:53,375
You need to go with Greylock. 
Leave immediately.

812
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:56,420
I stay. If the serpent wants me, 
it can have me!

813
01:18:56,711 --> 01:19:00,757
Your mother lived to give birth to you
and I promised her to keep you safe.

814
01:19:00,924 --> 01:19:04,302
You are not listening to me.
I can put an end to all of this!

815
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:06,096
Mani!

816
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:08,807
It seems the boy is a girl and 
a Volsung princess, no doubt!

817
01:19:08,974 --> 01:19:10,434
What are you speaking of, you fool?

818
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,561
Shut up!
I heard everything !

819
01:19:12,728 --> 01:19:15,147
So you want to put an end to all of this?
So you will, little princess!

820
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:19,109
Let her go!

821
01:19:26,324 --> 01:19:27,409
Father!

822
01:19:28,785 --> 01:19:30,954
What is going on?

823
01:19:31,788 --> 01:19:34,291
Answer me! Erick?

824
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:36,960
Explain yourself!

825
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:40,547
Of course, an explanation!
Get around, everybody!

826
01:19:40,839 --> 01:19:43,258
Come closer!
We have in our midst's...

827
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:45,260
a Volsung princess!

828
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:46,094
What?

829
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:47,345
Impossible!

830
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:52,601
It's true, the serpent has come for me
and I go willingly to my death!

831
01:19:55,437 --> 01:20:00,275
I failed...
in my duty to you and your mother.

832
01:20:01,485 --> 01:20:05,530
No, no dad,
you loved me as your daughter.

833
01:20:06,031 --> 01:20:08,700
There is no failure in that.

834
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,209
How can this be?

835
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:18,919
The old man kept her hid 
for all these years

836
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:21,963
and he would have gladly 
watched you die in her place.

837
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:27,094
Royal blood will be sacrificed today
but it will not be your blood, my love.

838
01:20:27,385 --> 01:20:29,262
It will be the human blood 
the serpent wants, hers!

839
01:20:29,429 --> 01:20:30,889
To the beach!

840
01:20:31,181 --> 01:20:33,517
Let's get it! Up here!

841
01:20:34,601 --> 01:20:36,228
Come on...

842
01:20:36,603 --> 01:20:37,896
Be strong!

843
01:20:38,647 --> 01:20:40,732
I want to save her.

844
01:20:40,982 --> 01:20:42,442
It's too late, son!

845
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:46,196
No, you need to trust me.
I know how to stop the serpent.

846
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:47,864
How?

847
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:50,742
I need a horse.

848
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:56,832
Jormungand!

849
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:02,671
I know you can hear me!

850
01:21:04,673 --> 01:21:07,426
We have your princess!

851
01:21:08,009 --> 01:21:11,721
Take her and leave us in peace!

852
01:21:22,232 --> 01:21:23,525
Try the battle horn.

853
01:21:49,176 --> 01:21:51,678
What is taking so long?

854
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:54,473
Go, again!

855
01:22:15,452 --> 01:22:17,079
By the gods!

856
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:18,663
You felt?

857
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:25,003
- We're too late.
- Not too late, now summon the serpent!

858
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:38,308
Come and get her,
you slimery sea worm!

859
01:22:42,104 --> 01:22:43,021
Mani!

860
01:22:45,065 --> 01:22:46,358
Stop him!

861
01:22:51,947 --> 01:22:54,032
I have to do this!

862
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:39,911
Mani! Run Mani!

863
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,168
Erick!

864
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:27,584
Erick...

865
01:24:28,085 --> 01:24:30,754
Erick, Erick, Erick!

866
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,561
Erick!

867
01:25:15,882 --> 01:25:19,845
And so it came that Erick the Blessed
became Erick the Savior.

868
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:22,848
Thor's Lightning 
never touched him again.

869
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,475
However, as the months passed

870
01:25:25,642 --> 01:25:29,020
the Gods did bless Erick
in other ways...
