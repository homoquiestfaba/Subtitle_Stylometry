00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:19,660
Hi.

2
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,371
<i>HeY-</i>

3
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:23,705
What can I get you?

4
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:27,709
Well, um, lwas thinking about...

5
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,002
<i>the...</i>

6
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:32,756
Turkey sandwich?

7
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:37,757
Just guessing.

8
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,976
Iced tea?

9
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:44,977
That's right.

10
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:52,981
Can I get you something else?

11
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:55,070
No. No, I'm good.

12
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,071
Thanks.

13
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,239
Okay.

14
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
You know, I... I was wondering...

15
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:05,247
Yes?

16
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:08,417
It's been weeks now,
me coming here, and...

17
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:11,086
and, <i>um...</i>

18
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:14,339
I was thinking,
what if I come here tomorrow

19
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,259
and you're no longer here?

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,014
Well, I mean, lwasn't planning
on spending the rest of my life here,

21
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,057
- right? I mean...
- You see? That's my point.

22
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,475
You know?

23
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:29,521
Uh, what if you leave
and I never find out your...

24
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,148
your favorite ice cream

25
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,899
or your favorite movie,

26
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,484
stuff like that?

27
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,695
My favorite movie's "Fight Club."

28
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,990
My favorite ice cream is chocolate.

29
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:44,991
Do you want to go out
with me sometime?

30
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:27,954
Yeah, hello.

31
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,376
Ellen.

32
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:33,460
What?

33
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,587
[crying 1.

34
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:37,923
What happened?

35
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:29,262
Who are you looking for?

36
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:33,562
Number 12.

37
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:38,563
It's right next door.

38
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:52,498
Sarah?

39
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:13,811
Shit.

40
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,901
Sarah?

41
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:33,205
Oh, my God.

42
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:38,206
I thought that was you.

43
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:42,005
What's going on here?

44
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:45,842
Are you all right?

45
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,345
Ellen. She's dead.

46
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,555
We gotta get out of here. Now!

47
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:51,807
Look, we gotta get your stuff!

48
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:52,420
Let's go.

49
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:06,571
I should go to the police.

50
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:10,700
They're probably already there.

51
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:15,701
Maybe we should split town for a while.

52
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,753
Here.

53
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:23,880
Have a coffee, a muffin.

54
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:27,968
It'll help you feel better.

55
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,846
The girl is Ellen,

56
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,139
my roommate.

57
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,142
She was on her own.

58
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,812
She'd lost her parents
a couple years ago

59
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:43,813
in some accident,
fell into drugs.

60
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:49,573
We got into a fight...

61
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:53,410
because I asked her
not to get loaded around me.

62
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,579
A couple hours later,

63
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,875
I heard her fighting
with the guy next door, Eddie,

64
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:02,294
her dealer.

65
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:06,089
And then it stopped.

66
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,133
And I saw her...

67
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:11,469
on the couch sleeping.

68
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,470
Only, she wasn't breathing.

69
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:24,024
I don't do that anymore.

70
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:24,525
Okay.

71
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,372
Thank you for last night.

72
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:44,373
It really meant a lot to me.

00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,006
<i>You don't...</i>

74
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:52,260
think I'm trash?

75

Everybody's got a story.

76
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:59,976
Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.

77
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:00,477
Okay.

78
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,952
This is not my stuff.

79
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,745

107
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,634
but it could work.

00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,970
<i>Nobody on. A perfect game.</i>

109
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:02,932

My name is Ellen Niles.

128
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,831
I'm 21 years old,

129
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:17,126
visited my late Uncle Zachary once,
almost 15 years ago.

130
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:20,338
I was real young,
so I don't really remember much.

131
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,341
Why did Niles
leave all his cash to Ellen,

132
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,093
to you?

133
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,762
He didn't have any kids of his own.

134
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,764
Besides my parents,
who passed away,

135
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,516
I'm his only living relative.

136
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,060
How did Niles get so rich?

137
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:39,061
My grandfather was a lawyer
and developer in Pasadena.

138
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,234
Very good.

139
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:52,533
And I like that.

140
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:07,051

143
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:12,640
Good to meet you.

144
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:17,641
- Please.
- Thank you.

145
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,357
Okay, you just need
to sign right there.

146
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,484
Oh, oh,
first I'm gonna need to see

147
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,695
- some picture l.D.
- Oh, sure.

148
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,531
You know, a driver's license, birth cert,
passport, something like that.

149
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,742
It's just a formality.

150
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,416
Okay.

151
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,542
Heh.

152
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:44,543
If you could sign right there.

153
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:53,181
Well, should I show you
around the property?

154
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,682
Sure. All right.

155
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,774
I have a question.

156
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:05,651
What kind of money
are we talking about?

157
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:09,989
Well, let's just say
your uncle was a prominent man.

158
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,992
We're talking in
the seven-figure range.

159
00:15:12,993 --> 00:15:13,993
Oh.

160
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:27,840
We just walk over to that hill...

161
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:30,635
you can get a view of the whole place.

162
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:35,636
Right over there,
that's God's country.

163
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,560
See that second ridge,
right there?

164
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,109
Right along there,
that's the border,

165
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,655
the second ridge,
and it goes all the way around.

166
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:54,867
What's that turned-over tractor
doing there?

167
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,202
Oh.

168
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:58,121
Oh, that's...

169
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:01,082
That's where your uncle
met his demise.

170
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,708
What happened?

171
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:03,793
<i>Well...</i>

172
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,045
nobody knows for sure,
you know,

173
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:07,588
but maybe the heat was a factor.

174
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,632
It was over 100 degrees that day.

175
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,175
He flipped the tractor.

176
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,345
He must have hit his head.

177
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,849
Thanks for your time, folks.

178
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,601
I'm real sorry about your loss.

179
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:21,894
Thanks.

180
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:26,895
I'll try and do my best to make things
as easy as possible for you.

181
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:31,942
You two have a good evening.

182
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,830
That guy makes me nervous.

183
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,499
You did great,

184
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,500
except you shouldn't have pushed
so hard about the old man's money.

185
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,383
Everything all right
with you boys?

186
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:55,052
Well, everything's fine
now that you're here.

187
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,387
Huh.

188
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:59,474
Call me if you need anything.

189
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:03,436
All right. We Will.

190
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:05,980
That cookie pusher's
got the hots for you, little brother.

191
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,899
Please. Heh heh.

192
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,235
Foreigners mention what they were
gonna do with the inheritance?

193
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:16,157
Mm. Didn't say.

194
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,534
Don't it strike you
the least bit strange

195
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:23,122
that he leaves all that scratch
to some girl he barely knew?

196
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:25,374
No.

197
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,710
It's called inheritance, Bob.

198
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,629
She's entitled to it, by birth.

199
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,464
I know what the word
"inheritance" means.

200
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:32,757
<i>Well...</i>

201
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:36,385
Anyway, I gotta finish up
another report.

202
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:39,847
Burglary yesterday
over at the Lazy Inn.

203
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:42,642
Sounds like you got
a crime wave on your hands.

204
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:47,643
Yeah. All started up
since Niles kicked.

205
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:51,150
Hey, how about leaving me
some scratch for this?

206
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:52,693
No!

207
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:53,945
That's on you, bro.

208
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:58,946
It was on me yesterday!

209
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,494
<i>J' Sweet smell of perfume J'.</i>

210
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:48,495
<i>J' Fading fast J'.</i>

211
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:02,305
<i>J' Say you love me, too... J'.</i>

212
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,015
Sarah?

213
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:07,893
- <i>I'm in</i> here.
- <i>J' I feel like</i> a <i>fool J'.</i>

214
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:11,272
<i>J' For thinking about J'.</i>

215
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:16,068
<i>J' Having you... J'.</i>

216
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:17,862
What is it?

217
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:19,196
They're letters,

218
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:21,115
love letters from...

219
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,326
from some woman.

220
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,244
How romantic.

221
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,912
I found a fancy painting.

222
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,164
Listen to this.

223
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:31,500
"L know in my heart this child is ours,

224
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:32,960
"no matter what you say.

225
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:35,296
"L beg you to acknowledge your son,

226
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:39,175
who, in your heart,
you must know is yours."

227
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,635
The last thing we need
is someone else

228
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:42,970
thinking they can
get in on the money.

229
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:59,316
Hurry up, fat man.

230
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,510
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

231
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:27,511
Come back here! Hey!

232
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,357
Whoa!

233
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:37,441
Look at this thing.

234
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,111
Whoa.

235
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,487
It's a hunting rifle.

236
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:46,488
Be careful.

237
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:51,288
Put it away.

238
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:51,789
Please?

239
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,161
It's okay.

240
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:31,746
Did we shoot somebody?

241
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:36,747
Oh, my God.

242
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:31,597
<i>HEY! HEY, hey, hombre!</i>

243
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,183
Had a small accident.

244
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:39,184
Need a lift into town.

245
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,704
Thank God you're back.

246
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,541
I was so worried.

247
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,251
I looked everywhere.

248
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:01,585
Whoever it was...

249
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:06,173
disappeared.

250
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:07,508
You didn't, uh,

251
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:12,012
tell anybody about us
coming here, did you?

252
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:13,764
What?

253
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,312
I can't believe you would
even ask me that.

254
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:22,898
Okay. Okay. Sorry.

255
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,578
But what about the car?

256
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:38,163
I mean, somebody is gonna
be looking for that.

257
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:43,164
What do you want me to do?
Call the cops?

258
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:47,339
I wouldn't worry about it.

259
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,340
I'll make sure nobody'll find it.

260
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:57,308
Anyway, I pushed the El Camino
to the old barn

261
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:00,060
next to Niles' Caddy.

262
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,108
We haven't had nothin'
like this for a while, Sal.

263
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,568
- Where'd it happen?
- I know.

264
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:09,320
Right out front, sheriff.
Right here.

265
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,488
You got that report I asked for?

266
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:15,117
Yes, sir.

267
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:17,161
I saw him, Bob.

268
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:19,288
Must've been a city hoodlum,

269
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:22,291
'cause he got in there
and hot-wired that sum-bitch

270
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:24,126
in less than two seconds.

271
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:27,296
'67 blue El Camino, right, Sal?

272
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:29,298
License plate Q74436?

273
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:30,799
That is correct, sir.

274
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,886
And you could identify him
if you saw him again?

275
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:36,597
Sure as the sun beatin' down
on this place tomorrow.

276
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:38,057
Will heat it t0110.

277
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,644
<i>J' Ain't no doubt about it... J'</i>

278
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:44,021
I'm gonna call in a sketch artist.

279
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:46,732
I know every badge
for five counties.

280
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:51,733
We'll get your truck back.
Don't you worry, Sal.

281
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,669
Hello.

282
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,711
Hi.

283
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:11,757
Um, my name is Belle.

284
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:15,386
I used to be Mr. Niles' housekeeper.

285
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,387
I'm Billy,

286
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:17,930
Ellen's boyfriend.

287
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:19,390
Hi, Billy.

288
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:20,724
You have a seat.

289
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:21,725
Thank you.

290
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:22,726
You're welcome.

291
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,520
What can I do for you?

292
00:25:24,521 --> 00:25:29,521
I... I baby-sat for Mr. Niles, years ago,
when Ellen was visiting.

293
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:33,237
I bet she'll remember me.
Heh heh.

294
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,947
Ellen's asleep.

295
00:25:34,948 --> 00:25:36,365
Oh.

296
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,075
The heat, you know.

297
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:41,078
I've been coming here
for more than 40 years,

298
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,498
keeping this place tidy.

299
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,208
I, uh, wouldn't mind

300
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:51,209
keeping the place clean
for you, too.

301
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:54,717
That's very kind.

302
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:59,638
We're not gonna be here
for that much longer.

303
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:38,594
Howdy.

304
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:39,845
Sheriff Robert Brogden.

305
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:42,723
Nice to make your acquaintance.

306
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,224
What can I do for you?

307
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:46,935
Well, me and Deputy Fenway here
are looking for a stolen car,

308
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:49,104
an old El Camino,

309
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:51,482
blue, metallic.

310
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:55,194
Don't suppose y'all know
something about it?

311
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,320
Sorry. We, uh...

312
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,530
We just arrived from out of town.

313
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,866
Ah.

314
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,076
Excuse me.

315
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:04,578
Of course.

316
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,331
Yeah, sometimes kids'll
take a car out for a joy ride

317
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:10,667
and then dump it in the fields.

318
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:15,172
I wish I could help,
but I haven't seen it.

319
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:20,173
You don't mind if we look around
the property, do you?

320
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,930
No, not at all.

321
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:34,733
You get them pictures?

322
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:35,859
Oh, yeah.

323
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,028
What exactly are you up to, boss?

324
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,364
Just keep your eyes
and ears open, Earl.

325
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:41,990
My daddy always taught me to check

326
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:46,991
where you least expect
to find anything.

327
00:27:54,462 --> 00:27:59,462
What about that barn?

328
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,927
What are you doing?

329
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:04,888
We cannot afford to let
that hillbilly arrest us.

330
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:09,889
You're crazy.

331
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:22,948
Honey?

332
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:32,287
Bob? What are you doing
bothering these nice young people?

333
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:41,008
Not bothering a soul.

334
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:46,009
Ha ha. You need a search warrant
to search people's property.

335
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:52,473
What would I do without you,
little bro?

336
00:28:57,233 --> 00:29:02,233
I've enjoyed about as much
of this as I can stand.

337
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:03,906
Earl.

338
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:20,255
I'm so sorry about
my overzealous brother.

339
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,467
He's, uh, been like that
since we were kids.

340
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:24,551
Brothers?

341
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,094
- Yeah.
- I had no idea.

342
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:27,846
Robert Brogden, Sr., our daddy,

343
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:30,432
was sheriff for two decades
before him. Heh heh heh.

344
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:31,934
Is that right?

345
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:33,852
He's just a little bit unsettled

346
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:36,396
because there's been
a rash of crime lately.

347
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:38,273
And, uh, Tremo's a small town.

348
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:40,776
Drunk teenagers
'bout the worst thing we get.

349
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:42,736
AnyWaY...

350
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:46,990
there's been a little hiccup
in your case.

351
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:47,991
A hiccup?

352
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:50,494
Mm-hmm.

353
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:54,122
Somebody has filed an injunction.

354
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:56,959
An... An injunction?

355
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,001
Who?

356
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,461
I don't know.

357
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:02,047
Some guy's claiming
he's Niles' son.

358
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:03,882
I don't get it.

359
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:07,135
Doesn't the will
leave everything to me?

360
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:08,595
Yes, it does.

361
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:11,723
However, if Niles
didn't know he had a son

362
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,726
and then suddenly
he found out about this son

363
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:17,229
and if this son
could somehow prove

364
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,607
that Niles was in the middle <i>of...</i>

365
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:23,860
changing his will to include his son,

366
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:26,446
well, that wouldn't be good.

367
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:30,784
However, if we could prove that
while Niles knew he had this son,

368
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:35,122
he still wasn't gonna
leave him nothin'...

369
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:36,540
that would be better.

370
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,750
Uh, would you excuse me
for a second?

371
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:39,751
Sure.

372
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:40,252
Thanks.

373
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:02,983
What's this?

374
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:07,984
I found this a few days ago.

375
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:29,676
This is very telling.

376
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,887
I'm glad you showed this to me.

377
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:35,599
This will definitely help your case.

378
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,019
But you still gonna
need something more.

379
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,520
More?

380
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:46,401
This isn't his letter.

381
00:31:46,402 --> 00:31:49,488
What you need is
something written by him,

382
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:52,491
that says all of his estate
goes to Ellen,

383
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:54,576
despite any other claims.

384
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,953
What, uh...

385
00:31:56,954 --> 00:32:01,333
What are the odds of finding that?

386
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:04,878
You know what?
There's no reason to get...

387
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:06,505
too concerned.

388
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:10,258
When I think about it,
the burden of proof

389
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,013
is gonna be on this rival party.

390
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:17,974
<i>It'sjust, uh...</i>

391
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:20,936
it's just gonna take a little more time,

392
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:24,481
and round here,
we ain't got nothin' but time.

393
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:29,482
I think we should get out of here.

394
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:35,659
Ellen's dead.

395
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,454
We're stealing her money.

396
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:44,455
Billy, nothing is right
about any of this.

397
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,044
Look“.

398
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:49,548
Hey, let's just stick
with this a little longer,

399
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:54,469
and if it gets too dicey, we leave.

400
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,470
What do you think?

401
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:04,892
I think you're nuts.

402
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:20,533
Did you hear that?

403
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:16,330
Hey! Hey!

404
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:26,682
Stay inside. Lock the door.

405
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,817
<i>Ha ha ha.</i>

406
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:18,818
<i>Your daddy?</i>

407
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:28,498
<i>Yeah, that-a-boy, Jamie.</i>

408
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:33,499
That-a-boy.

409
00:35:37,508 --> 00:35:41,720
<i>Who's your master?</i>

410
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:42,221
<i>Go on.</i>

411
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:48,393
<i>Go on now.</i>

412
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:51,229
<i>You heard me.</i>

413
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,317
<i>Are we having fun now, Zachary?</i>

414
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:15,920
Start the car,
or I'll break your neck.

415
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:20,216
It's your old pal, Eddie.

416
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:22,886
You little bitch.

417
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:25,305
That was me on the porch.

418
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:29,142
That was me who took
a fucking bullet in the gut.

419
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:35,519
I followed your ass
1,700 fucking miles.

420
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,652
Your dead cunt friend Ellen,

421
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,862
the one with the rich uncle,

422
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:44,908
owes me a lot of cash.

423
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:46,701
And guess what?

424
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:50,455
You, little twit, will pay up.

425
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:55,456
Do you understand?

426
00:36:56,295 --> 00:37:00,090
Question...

427
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:05,091
What's the boyfriend's name?

428
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:13,061
He's just a guy.

429
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:16,606
He's nobody.

430
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:18,900
Aah!

431
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,485
What's the boyfriend's name?

432
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:20,986
Billy.

433
00:37:24,782 --> 00:37:26,491
Billy.

434
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:29,160
Okay.

435
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:32,956
Now, you keep it nice and quiet

436
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:35,917
about me bumping into you.

437
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:39,295
Aah!

438
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:41,256
Otherwise...

439
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:45,510
Billy's the first one to go.

440
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:52,930
I'm here to collect on Ellen's behalf.

441
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:55,478
Soto speak.

442
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:58,189
The lawyer said it'll be a few more days

443
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,943
before he's gonna transfer the assets.

444
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:05,822
And by the way,
I want my piece back.

445
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:10,823
You could come by tomorrow,
room 212.

446
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,384
Here's a little treat,
for old time's sake.

447
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:30,805
You got a good scam going, Sarah.

448
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:35,806
I'll see you tomorrow.

449
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:39,272
A burglary? Jesus Christ.

450
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,399
The guy broke
into the house last night.

451
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,943
On his way out,
he dropped something,

452
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:45,737
a DVD.

453
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:50,658
I've seen... I've seen about...
just about enough of that.

454
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:53,453
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go lie down.

455
00:38:53,454 --> 00:38:55,371
I'm not feeling too well.

456
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:58,666
Well, I'm sorry to put you
through that, Ms. Niles.

457
00:38:58,667 --> 00:38:59,667
Not to worry.

458
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:00,835
I'll talk to you later.

459
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,465
I'm gonna get rid of this filth.

460
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:08,718
I mean, Zachary Niles
has a respectable reputation.

461
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,513
Its getting tainted now
is not gonna help our cause.

462
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:13,723
You know what I'm saying?

463
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:18,436
Would Niles being gay

464
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:23,437
weaken the claims
of an illegitimate son?

465
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:25,235
Not really.

466
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:30,031
Men with homosexual tastes
fathering children...

467
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:32,033
happens every day.

468
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:34,786
- In your professional opinion...
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:37,789
How much longer
is this whole ordeal gonna last?

470
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,582
Well... Hmm.

471
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,669
Once foul play is suspected,

472
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,297
Texas probate courts will put
an immediate hold on this case.

473
00:39:46,298 --> 00:39:48,591
Eh, a month.

474
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:50,134
Well, you know what?

475
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:55,135
Probably closer to two.

476
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:01,145
A month or two?

477
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:02,772
Mm-hmm.

478
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:07,694
I don't think
we could stay that long.

479
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:10,071
Are you folks strapped for cash?

480
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:12,156
'Cause you know I have
power of attorney.

481
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:17,157
It wouldn't be improper for me
to forward Ellen some money.

482
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:21,624
How much you have in mind?

483
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:26,045
HOW 'bout $5,000?

484
00:40:26,046 --> 00:40:28,715
We'll wait.

485
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:31,843
We'll wait for the settlement.

486
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:35,013
Okay. Suit yourself.

487
00:40:35,014 --> 00:40:36,431
I gotta get 90mg-

488
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:38,224
Well...

489
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:39,893
Well, Billy,

490
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:42,186
you know anything about art?

491
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:44,230
No.

492
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:48,902
Niles' taste in art was pretty eclectic.

493
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:50,862
See this painting here?

494
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:55,074
I believe he paid 135,000
for that one.

495
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:58,328
You'd probably fetch twice that
at any art auction today.

496
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,038
$135,000?

497
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,789
- Mm-hmm.
- For this?

498
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,124
Ha ha ha!

499
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,418
Yep. Well...

500
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:06,586
I hope, uh...

501
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:08,046
I hope Ellen's feeling better.

502
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,632
And, uh, trust me.

503
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:13,801
It'll all work itself out.

504
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:18,802
Have a good day.

505
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:24,228
Anybody you recognizing?

506
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:27,106
No, I ain't seen
the mean-looking one.

507
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,149
Hmm.

508
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,194
But I've seen them around.

509
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:33,029
The lottery winners. Heh heh.

510
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,781
Bob!

511
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:37,408
What's on that pretty
little mind of yours?

512
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,118
Is your brother seeing anyone?

513
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,620
No.

514
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:43,206
He's still Tremo's
most eligible bachelor.

515
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:44,499
I'll mention you asked, though.

516
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,334
I wish you would.

517
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:50,296
I ain't seeing no one, Alice.

518
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:52,507
I ain't teaching preschool.

519
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:55,176
You don't know
what you're missing.

520
00:41:56,637 --> 00:42:01,182
Oh, I gotta go.

521
00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:04,686
I got something important
to relay to you, boss.

522
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:05,979
What is it?

523
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,816
They faxed over
the coroner's report.

524
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:12,819
Rules out heat stroke
as the cause of death,

525
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,323
said Niles died of suffocation.

526
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:22,829
Now ain't that a pisser?

527
00:42:37,136 --> 00:42:42,136
Where have you been?

528
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:48,229
You okay?

529
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:53,230
You, uh... You seem...

530
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,320
I hate this place.

531
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,223
This time, we got a warrant.

532
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:25,683
You got that right, Earl.

533
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:35,272
What's he doing here?

534
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:46,245
Folks.

535
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:49,165
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

536
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,625
What, um...

537
00:43:50,626 --> 00:43:52,418
What can we do for you, sheriff?

538
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:56,756
I had a look at the coroner's report
concerning your uncle,

539
00:43:56,757 --> 00:44:00,510
and it appears he did not die
of natural causes.

540
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:03,888
Suffocation seems to be
the cause of death.

541
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:05,723
As of today, this plot of land's

542
00:44:05,724 --> 00:44:09,143
a crime scene,
a homicide investigation.

543
00:44:09,144 --> 00:44:11,604
Now, I'll notify Cameron.

544
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:14,065
Meanwhile, we're gonna do
some dusting for fingerprints

545
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,609
on your uncle's tractor.

546
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:21,610
Mind if I come along?

547
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:27,745
Be my guest.

548
00:44:51,603 --> 00:44:53,896
How we doing, boys? Any prints?

549
00:44:53,897 --> 00:44:56,440
Looks like we got
a whole bunch of clean ones.

550
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:58,860
Good job.

551
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:01,696
Son, you don't mind if we take
your fingerprints, do you?

552
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:04,699
I'm talking you and Ms. Niles.

553
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,325
You two could fall by the station

554
00:45:06,326 --> 00:45:09,245
first thing in the morning,
it'd be appreciated.

555
00:45:09,246 --> 00:45:10,788
Fingerprints?

556
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:13,457
Yeah. It's a tradition
here in Tremo,

557
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:17,670
kind of a keepsake
to remember you by.

558
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:19,088
You got a lot of fucking nerve

559
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:20,715
to show up here
in the middle of the night...

560
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,842
Hey, don't get your panties
in an uproar, son.

561
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:25,887
I'm just doing myjOb-

562
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:29,807
You be there at 10 A.M. sharp.

563
00:45:29,808 --> 00:45:31,475
Have a good evening.

564
00:45:33,812 --> 00:45:35,313
Good work, boys!

565
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,401
<i>This is easy listening,</i>

566
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:43,362
<i>3 A.M. on the dot.</i>

567
00:45:43,363 --> 00:45:46,574
<i>In case you're hitting the road
early today, be careful.</i>

568
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,743
<i>It's mighty breezy out there.</i>

569
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:52,163
<i>Meanwhile,
here's some musical caffeine</i>

570
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:55,416
<i>that'// get you going.</i>

571
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:58,127
<i>J' They pulled up all their ties J'.</i>

572
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:01,255
<i>J' And they were riding like</i> a <i>log J'.</i>

573
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:04,383
<i>J' Got pennies in my pocket J'.</i>

574
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:07,762
<i>J' When I thought I had some dimes J'.</i>

575
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:10,598
<i>J' I guess everything happens J'.</i>

576
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,018
<i>J' For</i> a <i>reason sometimes J'.</i>

577
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:16,938
<i>J' Yeah J'.</i>

578
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:20,316
<i>J' Been on 61 all day J'.</i>

579
00:46:20,317 --> 00:46:24,028
<i>J' Yeah J'.</i>

580
00:46:32,162 --> 00:46:37,162
<i>J' Trust in... J'.</i>

581
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:47,009
Where were you two June 2?

582
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,386
Bob!

583
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:50,554
You are crossing the line.

584
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:52,515
You don't have to answer that.

585
00:46:52,516 --> 00:46:54,642
Was that the day he was killed?

586
00:46:54,643 --> 00:46:57,061
Ellen and I were in L.A.
We can prove it, too.

587
00:46:57,062 --> 00:46:59,814
How much you think
old man Niles was worth, Billy?

588
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:04,735
Okay, Robert, that's enough.

589
00:47:04,736 --> 00:47:09,736
We're all done here.

590
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,993
<i>Nah...</i>

591
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:13,577
People do some real crazy shit

592
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:15,871
to get their hands
on a winning lottery ticket.

593
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,206
Even a hick-town sheriff knows that.

594
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:18,416
You know, right from the jump,

595
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,625
I could tell that you, son,

596
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:21,627
are nothin' but a bad piece of news.

597
00:47:21,628 --> 00:47:23,212
Oh, you could tell, huh?

598
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:25,589
Listen, I know my rights.
Can I go now?

599
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,924
I bet you do know your rights.

600
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:29,135
I bet you've had a lot of scrapes
with the law.

601
00:47:29,136 --> 00:47:30,886
Ellen, Billy, you can go.

602
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:33,514
It's my office, Cam,
my investigation!

603
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:36,642
In case I haven't been clear,

604
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:38,311
sooner or later,

605
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:43,312
I'm gonna nail your maggot ass
to the wall.

606
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:52,279
EnjQy your day.

607
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:59,248
How to win friends.

608
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:01,876
Heh heh heh.

609
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:09,379
This whole thing
could take a while.

610
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:19,352
No, you just have to tell that lawyer
of yours you need the money now.

611
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:20,978
You're Ellen Niles.

612
00:48:20,979 --> 00:48:25,316
It's your money, darling, right?

613
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:26,942
What if I can't?

614
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:28,152
You can.

615
00:48:28,153 --> 00:48:33,153
You do as I say,
and all will be good.

616
00:48:36,953 --> 00:48:41,953
I better leave.

617
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,627
Already?

618
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:49,628
Let's play a little, hey?

619
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:02,436
Stop.

620
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:07,233
Don't fuck with <i>me...</i>

621
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:12,234
you good-for-nothing crack bitch.

622
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,452
Concentrate on transferring
some of them assets

623
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:23,453
into my fucking wallet!

624
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:28,838
Or I swear...

625
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:33,839
I'll kill the both 0f you.

626
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:47,310
You look pale.

627
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:54,489
Thanks.

628
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:05,082
You think I don't know
what's going on with you?

629
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,542
What are you talking about?

630
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:08,961
You're sleeping 14 hours a day.

631
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:11,422
That's what I'm talking about.

632
00:50:11,423 --> 00:50:14,008
Listen to me. You need help.

633
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:15,509
Hey, go back to L.A.

634
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,720
Go to rehab if that's what it takes.

635
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:19,805
I'll stay here,
and I'll get the money.

636
00:50:19,806 --> 00:50:21,807
Okay, then we can meet up
when I get back.

637
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:23,017
Ha!

638
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:25,853
And I can count on that?

639
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:27,229
I take one look in your eyes,

640
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:32,230
and I know exactly
what you've been doing.

641
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:37,486
You think about what I'm saying,
unless you want to wind up like Ellen.

642
00:50:42,037 --> 00:50:47,037
You're wrong.

643
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:09,226
"Sly Wheaton."

644
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:29,291
Hi. William, I take it?

645
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:30,584
That's me.

646
00:51:30,585 --> 00:51:32,253
You can call me Billy, if you want.

647
00:51:32,254 --> 00:51:36,799
Must be a lot of people
trying to horn in on the inheritance.

648
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,676
What you drinking?

649
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:40,886
I'm fine. Thanks.

650
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:44,265
Ah, suit yourself.

651
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:47,142
You don't mind if I do?

652
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:48,894
See, I actually need some advice.

653
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:50,729
I can pay you as soon as I can...

654
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:54,483
I bet you can.

655
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:56,652
Let's say...

656
00:51:56,653 --> 00:51:59,697
Suppose the old man
has an illegitimate child

657
00:51:59,698 --> 00:52:01,991
who was trying to get
some of his money.

658
00:52:01,992 --> 00:52:05,452
What would be
the quickest way to find a...

659
00:52:05,453 --> 00:52:08,038
some kind of solution?

660
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:10,040
Solution?

661
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,250
Listen.

662
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:14,878
You need a document
stating that Niles

663
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:17,673
wanted his money
going to his niece

664
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:19,842
and his niece only.

665
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:22,970
I don't have that document.

666
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:26,765
Well, you got a problem then, don't you?

667
00:52:26,766 --> 00:52:30,144
Yeah, I'll bet Niles knew all about this,

668
00:52:30,145 --> 00:52:34,940
'cause he came to me two days
before he passed away.

669
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:37,735
He was gonna have me change his will

670
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:42,736
to explicitly exclude anyone but Ellen.

671
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:48,287
Hmm.

672
00:52:48,288 --> 00:52:53,083
Kind of a coincidence,
don't you think?

673
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:58,084
Niles ends up dead right before
he intends to change his will.

674
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:01,967
Huh.

675
00:53:01,968 --> 00:53:06,968
You want that drink now?

676
00:53:28,536 --> 00:53:33,536
I guess I wasn't so wrong after all.

677
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:37,586
Yeah, I found the pipe...

678
00:53:37,587 --> 00:53:42,587
in Ellen's s-stuff.

679
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:48,389
You know, with...

680
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,265
all this shit that we're dealing with,

681
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:55,266
ljust feel like it would be okay...

682
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,359
to have a little bit of fun.

683
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,820
<i>J' I do believe... J'</i>

684
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:06,198
I'm sorry.

685
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:10,786
- I'll <i>stop.</i> I <i>promise.</i>
- <i>J' I do believe J'.</i>

686
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:15,249
<i>J' Yeah, but your people down here J'.</i>

687
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,918

688

689
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:42,025
Jamie...

690
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:44,445
pick up the phone.

691
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:48,824
I gotta show you something.

692
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:51,160
I'll be over in a few.

693
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:51,773
[ Click 1.

694
00:54:58,376 --> 00:55:02,588
Sheriff.

695
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:04,298
No match.

696
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:06,550
But do you remember that fella

697
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:08,719
who used to work for Niles,
Jamie Albright?

698
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,762
Mm-hmm.

699
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:11,930
Turns out he had some priors,

700
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:16,931
and his prints are as clear as day.

701
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:23,025
Check this out.

702
00:55:23,026 --> 00:55:26,737
This rascal Billy
switched the DVD on me.

703
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:29,615
Goddamn tractor infomercial.

704
00:55:29,616 --> 00:55:30,616
<i>Put the dumpster on.</i>

705
00:55:30,617 --> 00:55:32,451
Are you sore at me?

706
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:33,702
You...

707
00:55:33,703 --> 00:55:37,581
don't talk!

708
00:55:37,582 --> 00:55:38,582
Idiot.

709
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,751
If you'd not lost the video

710
00:55:40,752 --> 00:55:42,753
in Niles' driveway,

711
00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:47,754
it all would have been just fine.

712
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,352
Niles.

713
00:55:58,353 --> 00:56:01,104
Jamie.

714
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,190
We need to put this guy
on the payroll.

715

Hmm.

716
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:13,742
I'm gonna comb through
every inch of Tremo if I have to.

717

I Will find this killer.

718
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:44,857
I'm coming. I'm coming.

I knew it.

726
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:37,451
Hmm?

727
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:41,163
<i>Hey...</i>

728
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:45,042
I think we got what we needed.

729
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:47,294
I'll be back soon.

730
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:52,295
Be careful.

731
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,436
<i>J' Just hoping all night» J'.</i>

732
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:14,237
You know where I can find...

733
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:16,573
this address?

734
00:58:19,744 --> 00:58:24,744
Excuse me for a minute.

735
00:58:27,794 --> 00:58:31,004
<i>R All my life, /... r.</i>

736
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:32,589
What's going on here?

737
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,424
I swear.
I was gonna pay you back.

738
00:58:34,425 --> 00:58:36,510
You stealing from your own father?

739
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:38,387
You piece of shit.

740
00:58:38,388 --> 00:58:39,805
Just a couple beers.

741
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:41,014
It's Friday night and all!

742
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:42,391
Son of a bitch!

743
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:43,517
Come on, sissy!

744
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:47,229
Why don't you start weeping
while you're at it?

745
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,149
Hey! Take it easy.

746
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,901
Why don't you go wait
at the counter

747
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:56,363
and mind your own
goddamn business?

748
00:58:56,364 --> 00:59:00,867
You want to try me?

749
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:03,495
You're with that Niles girl, ain't ya?

750
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:04,830
I recognize you.

751
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,873
Oh, yeah.

752
00:59:15,717 --> 00:59:20,717
<i>J' Yeah J'.</i>

753
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:25,930
- <i>J' I'm gonna fix my supper... J'</i>
- <i>Fucker.</i>

754
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:03,263
Hey, it's me, Sarah.

755
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:06,266
What do you want?

756
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:11,267
Thought you might be hungry.

757
01:00:18,613 --> 01:00:23,613
I really need to use the bathroom.

758
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:29,619
You're a strange girl.

759
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,465
Be a man for once.

760
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:41,259
Take care of that sum-bitch.

761
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:47,470
What are you waiting for,
you sissy?

762
01:01:02,448 --> 01:01:04,991
You and I need to talk.

763
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:09,037
Time to wrap things up.

764
01:01:09,038 --> 01:01:14,038
Know what I mean?

765
01:01:22,969 --> 01:01:27,969
What's on your mind, angel?

766
01:01:34,021 --> 01:01:37,440
You want some dope?

767
01:01:37,441 --> 01:01:42,441
That would be nice.

768
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:03,008
God!

769
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:11,057
Is this what you're looking for?

770
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:12,350
- Huh?
- Uh-huh.

771
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:14,436
Yeah. It fucking is!

772
01:02:14,437 --> 01:02:16,813
You get the fuck off me!

773
01:02:24,947 --> 01:02:29,947
Get the fuck off me.

774
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:31,453
FUCK you!

775
01:02:31,454 --> 01:02:33,663
You worthless piece
of fucking shit!

776
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:52,349
Angel.

777
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,552
MY angel.

778
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:09,449
32 Leo Street.

779
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:12,702
Where is that old woman's house?

780
01:04:27,445 --> 01:04:28,445
Hey!

781
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:29,529
Remember me?

782
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:33,116
This is for fucking with my dad!

783
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:43,460
Oh, my goodness.

784
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:47,464
Good thing I found him.

785
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:52,093
Have another little nip.

786
01:04:52,094 --> 01:04:53,595
All right.

787
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:58,224
Poor boy, he's been beaten.

788
01:04:58,225 --> 01:05:00,810
He'll live.

789
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:05,811
And call me if there's
any more trouble, Mama.

790
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:15,237
Bob, leave it be.

791
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,755
You know,
I was looking for you today.

792
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:32,008
For me?

793
01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:34,260
Well, if it was about
the housekeeping,

794
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,388
that could've waited
till tomorrow.

795
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:40,850
No, it wasn't about
the housekeeping.

796
01:05:40,851 --> 01:05:43,269
You and your late husband,
you, uh...

797
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:44,896
you raised two sons,

798
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:47,065
Sheriff Bob and Cameron.

799
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:48,775
Yes, that's right.

800
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:53,154
Two big, beautiful boys.

801
01:05:53,155 --> 01:05:55,490
Your family didn't mind
all those long hours

802
01:05:55,491 --> 01:05:58,535
with you keeping house
for Zachary Niles?

803
01:05:58,536 --> 01:05:59,869
Well, they...

804
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,789
It was a privilege
to work for someone

805
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:07,790
as accomplished and...
and prosperous as Mr. Niles.

806
01:06:08,796 --> 01:06:13,796
And we needed
the extra money. Heh.

807
01:06:28,023 --> 01:06:32,235
You, the late sheriff, Bob...

808
01:06:32,236 --> 01:06:34,070
you're like three peas in a pod.

809
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:37,991
Yes.

810
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:40,702
Not Cameron, though.

811
01:06:40,703 --> 01:06:43,329
Well, I don't know
what you mean.

812
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:47,333
You truly admired
and respected Niles, right?

813
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,877
Yes, of course.

814
01:06:48,878 --> 01:06:50,295
I told you. That...

815
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:51,796
You had a son with him,
didn't you?

816
01:06:51,797 --> 01:06:53,798
What?

817
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:57,427
How dare you?

818
01:06:57,428 --> 01:06:59,679
I read the letters you wrote him,

819
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,725
the ones asking him
to acknowledge your son.

820
01:07:03,726 --> 01:07:07,479
How could you stand for it?

821
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,648
After the way you took care of him?

822
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:15,028
After the way you felt about him?

823
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:20,029
It wasn't that simple.

824
01:07:20,493 --> 01:07:25,493
What would people think
if they knew what we were up to?

825
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:30,335
How would they treat my family,

826
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:32,128
my husband,

827
01:07:32,129 --> 01:07:37,129
my two little boys?

828
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:42,388
Cameron is Niles' son.

829
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,682
And when Niles handed
the inheritance to Ellen,

830
01:07:44,683 --> 01:07:48,228
Cameron realized
that he was gonna be cut out

831
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:50,563
of everything that was rightfully his,

832
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:53,608
<i>cut out...</i>

833
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:57,737
just like his mother had been.

834
01:07:57,738 --> 01:07:59,614
You have no right...

835
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,617
Deep down, you have to know...

836
01:08:02,618 --> 01:08:07,618
that it was Cameron
that killed Niles.

837
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:10,500
That is not possible.

838
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:13,002
Zach...

839
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:18,003
Mr. Niles' death
was an accident.

840
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:23,096
No, no. No, you're not up
on current affairs, ma'am.

841
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:28,097
The coroner's office
ruled Niles' death a homicide.

842
01:08:28,352 --> 01:08:33,352
Your son killed his own father.

843
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:38,361
You get out of here.

844
01:08:38,362 --> 01:08:41,447
You get out!

845
01:08:41,448 --> 01:08:45,285
I said leave!

846
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:50,391
What happened to you?

847
01:09:58,776 --> 01:10:03,776
There. Just like new.

848
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:16,538
I forgot the salad.

849
01:10:39,233 --> 01:10:44,112
You know what I was thinking
about this morning?

850
01:10:44,113 --> 01:10:48,366
Stanley's.

851
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:52,328
The day you asked me out.

852
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:56,624
I thought I would never
see you again.

853
01:10:56,625 --> 01:11:00,670
Stanley's...

854
01:11:00,671 --> 01:11:03,423
I hope I never have to work
in a place like that again.

855
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:05,550
Why should you?

856
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:10,551
You're about to be rich very soon.

857
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:16,144
What's with the drinking?

858
01:11:16,145 --> 01:11:21,145
What exactly did you have
in mind for after dinner?

859
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,359
You gonna stuff me in the trunk

860
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,360
like, uh, what's his name?

861
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:34,616
Edward Carney. That's it.

862
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,498
What?

863
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:40,877
You didn't think I knew
who you scored your dope from?

864
01:11:42,004 --> 01:11:45,214
I saw you at the motel tonight.

865
01:11:45,215 --> 01:11:46,382
Yep.

866
01:11:46,383 --> 01:11:47,383
Tell me something, Sarah.

867
01:11:47,384 --> 01:11:49,844
<i>Uh...</i>

868
01:11:49,845 --> 01:11:51,512
Did you fuck him first

869
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:53,431
and then kill him?

870
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:57,185
How exactly did that go down?

871
01:11:57,186 --> 01:12:00,062
That guy is Ellen's dealer.

872
01:12:00,063 --> 01:12:01,856
She owed him a ton of money,

873
01:12:01,857 --> 01:12:03,316
and fOT some TGHSOH,

874
01:12:03,317 --> 01:12:05,526
he thinks I'm the one
who has to pay him back.

875
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:09,530
Well, he's dead now.

876
01:12:09,531 --> 01:12:12,408
Might as well
get rid of me next, right?

877
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:16,162
I assume that is the plan, after all.

878
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:19,290
Why share the money
with Edward or me? Right?

879
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,876
I didn't even know
about Ellen's money

880
01:12:21,877 --> 01:12:25,046
until I found that letter!

881
01:12:25,047 --> 01:12:26,214
So you...

882
01:12:26,215 --> 01:12:27,673
Besides, this is
your fucking scheme!

883
01:12:27,674 --> 01:12:28,925
Do you remember that?

884
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:30,593
You're telling me
that Edward Carney

885
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:35,594
didn't have the exact same plan
a whole lot earlier?

886
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:41,813
You're drunk.

887
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:46,814
That's why you're talking so crazy.

888
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:03,584
"With respect to your
pending investigation...

889
01:13:03,585 --> 01:13:05,878
Please be informed that
the two suspects..."

890
01:13:07,256 --> 01:13:08,840
"...are both wanted
for questioning

891
01:13:08,841 --> 01:13:10,633
"in a local
homicide investigation...

892
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,470
"...death of Ellen Niles...

893
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:19,141
heroin-related overdose."

894
01:13:20,644 --> 01:13:23,688
Hmm.

895
01:13:31,864 --> 01:13:32,864
Hello.

896
01:13:32,865 --> 01:13:33,990
Billy.

897
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:35,992
How you doing?

898
01:13:35,993 --> 01:13:37,910
I've been better.

899
01:13:39,121 --> 01:13:40,830
I know the feeling.

900
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:42,248
Listen...

901
01:13:42,249 --> 01:13:44,041
is it possible, Billy,

902
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:48,713
that, uh, you gave me
the wrong DVD?

903
01:13:48,714 --> 01:13:52,717
You know, I wonder
what brother Bob would do

904
01:13:52,718 --> 01:13:54,677
if he got ahold of that video?

905
01:13:54,678 --> 01:13:59,678
Now, you listen to me,
you two-time loser.

906
01:13:59,892 --> 01:14:01,726
Are you trying to blackmail me?

907
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:04,979
'Cause I'll wipe
the fucking floor with you.

908
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:08,858
You think besmirching the late
Zachary Niles' spotless reputation

909
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:11,777
is gonna put you in good
with the sheriff, my brother?

910
01:14:11,778 --> 01:14:16,778
You want me to call the sheriff
right fucking now?

911
01:14:19,703 --> 01:14:21,245
All right.

912
01:14:21,246 --> 01:14:24,248
How much money do you want?

913
01:14:24,249 --> 01:14:27,752
I got $5,000.

914
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:29,503
Make it 10,

915
01:14:29,504 --> 01:14:32,673
cash, tonight.

916
01:14:32,674 --> 01:14:35,593
Then we'll leave.

917
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:38,054
Okay. 10, it is.

918
01:14:38,055 --> 01:14:43,055
And you bring that fucking DVD.

919
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:07,208
What's up?

920
01:15:07,209 --> 01:15:07,709
Get in.

921
01:15:12,714 --> 01:15:14,465
I just got back from Mama's.

922
01:15:14,466 --> 01:15:16,008
Guess who was there?

923
01:15:16,009 --> 01:15:18,928
The boyfriend, Billy.

924
01:15:18,929 --> 01:15:21,722
What the hell was he doing there?

925
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:23,057
Mama found him in the street.

926
01:15:23,058 --> 01:15:24,600
He got a little roughed up.

927
01:15:24,601 --> 01:15:26,686
Serves him right, the smartass.

928
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:30,272
Anyway, I got a piece of news for you

929
01:15:30,273 --> 01:15:33,025
that's gonna knock your <i>socks</i> off.

930
01:15:33,026 --> 01:15:35,903
Ellen Niles is dead.

931
01:15:35,904 --> 01:15:37,363
Is dead?

932
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:38,531
Mm.

933
01:15:38,532 --> 01:15:40,324
Well, then, wh-who...

934
01:15:40,325 --> 01:15:43,494
Sarah Johnson,
Ellen's roommate,

935
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:44,912
and Billy Brody.

936
01:15:44,913 --> 01:15:49,913
Sarah Johnson's boyfriend.

937
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:51,585
Heh.

938
01:15:51,586 --> 01:15:53,045
Where'd you get this?

939
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:54,380
L.A. Police Department.

940
01:15:54,381 --> 01:15:57,508
Says Ellen overdosed
on heroin weeks ago,

941
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:01,470
and this Brody guy, he did time in jail
for forgery, illegal gambling.

942
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:02,847
It's all there.

943
01:16:04,057 --> 01:16:06,183
Man! Ha ha ha.

944
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:07,852
I don't believe this.

945
01:16:07,853 --> 01:16:12,273
Eh, I knew something was up
with them two.

946
01:16:12,274 --> 01:16:13,607
Bob...

947
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:15,109
Hmm?

948
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,236
We got another problem.

949
01:16:17,237 --> 01:16:17,737
What?

950
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:27,034
I can barely talk about this.

951
01:16:29,374 --> 01:16:31,083
Ellen or Sarah...

952
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:36,084
whatever the hell her name is
gave me this.

953
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:42,549
They said they...
they found it at the house.

954
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:09,830
<i>No, this...</i>

955
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:11,082
What the hell is this?

956
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,042
<i>I mean...</i>

957
01:17:13,043 --> 01:17:14,585
Niles never had no son.

958
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:16,754
This... This... It's a forgery.

959
01:17:16,755 --> 01:17:21,008
Take a look at the writing.

960
01:17:21,009 --> 01:17:26,009
You know whose writing that is.

961
01:17:26,098 --> 01:17:28,182
No, I don't know nothin'.

962
01:17:28,183 --> 01:17:30,684
Mama used to spend
a lot of time over there.

963
01:17:30,685 --> 01:17:31,685
Don't say it.

964
01:17:31,686 --> 01:17:36,686
I'm that son.

965
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,990
You better shut up.

966
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:49,991
You don't believe me?

967
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:55,163
Go ask Mama.

968
01:18:01,508 --> 01:18:03,175
Oh, my God.

969
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,117
You know...

970
01:18:28,118 --> 01:18:33,080
that man in a black hood
in the video,

971
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:36,876
he looked to be about
your size and weight.

972
01:18:36,877 --> 01:18:41,877
You know what? I hope you can spend
that 10,000 before they arrest you.

973
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:46,635
It was you that killed Niles.

974
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:49,388
This world is a better place

975
01:18:49,389 --> 01:18:53,350
with Niles absent from it.

976
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:58,351
Trust me on that one.

977
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:07,198
And I bet you knew about us
all along, didn't you?

978
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,616
Well... Heh heh.

979
01:19:08,617 --> 01:19:11,076
I figured it out pretty quickly.

980
01:19:11,077 --> 01:19:14,246
You see, it came over the wire
that Ellen had died.

981
01:19:14,247 --> 01:19:18,792
Then you two dumb-asses show up here
with your hands out,

982
01:19:18,793 --> 01:19:22,338
had the whole town
in an uproar,

983
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:24,757
took all the attention
away from me.

984
01:19:24,758 --> 01:19:28,677
Perfect timing.

985
01:19:28,678 --> 01:19:32,514
I lived in this shithole my whole life.

986
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:35,351
This estate is my ticket out.

987
01:19:35,352 --> 01:19:37,645
It's in my blood,

988
01:19:37,646 --> 01:19:42,646
and I will have it.

989
01:19:43,526 --> 01:19:47,279
I tried to be fair to you

990
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,407
and that chippy of yours.

991
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:55,408
I gave you every chance to run.

992
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:07,963
Barn door's open.

993
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:15,432
Did you know that Mr. Sly Wheaton
has a legal document

994
01:20:15,433 --> 01:20:18,060
proving that every cent
of that estate

995
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:22,064
was intended for Ellen
and nobody else, period?

996
01:20:22,065 --> 01:20:23,691
Did you know
that Mr. Sly Wheaton

997
01:20:23,692 --> 01:20:26,527
had an unfortunate
setback tonight?

998
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:29,697
He's not gonna be processing
any more documents,

999
01:20:29,698 --> 01:20:34,698
legal or otherwise.

1000
01:20:52,762 --> 01:20:55,306
Oh, my goodness.

1001
01:20:55,307 --> 01:20:56,932
Now...

1002
01:20:56,933 --> 01:20:59,852
did you really think
that I'm gonna sit here

1003
01:20:59,853 --> 01:21:04,853
and let you walk away
with $10,000 of my money?

1004
01:21:33,219 --> 01:21:35,679
Checkmate.

1005
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:40,893
Ah.

1006
01:21:40,894 --> 01:21:45,356
I forgot all about you.

1007
01:21:45,357 --> 01:21:46,982
I will pull the trigger.

1008
01:21:46,983 --> 01:21:48,609
Yeah?

1009
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,695
And so will I.

1010
01:21:52,864 --> 01:21:54,406
[ Click 1

1011
01:21:56,326 --> 01:22:00,204
I do believe that's called...

1012
01:22:00,205 --> 01:22:03,791
shit out of luck.

1013
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:08,792
Goddamn fucking whore!

1014
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:13,133
Now...

1015
01:22:13,134 --> 01:22:16,553
which one of you wants to go first?

1016
01:22:16,554 --> 01:22:21,554
That's an interesting question.

1017
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:26,643
What the hell
are you doing here, Bob?!

1018
01:22:30,026 --> 01:22:34,363
You tell me.

1019
01:22:34,364 --> 01:22:37,574
Put the gun down, Cameron.

1020
01:22:37,575 --> 01:22:42,329
Robert, turn around,
drive away,

1021
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:46,125
and pretend like
you never came in here.

1022
01:22:46,126 --> 01:22:49,878
I am taking care of things.

1023
01:22:49,879 --> 01:22:52,798
Like you always have.

1024
01:22:52,799 --> 01:22:55,551
Now you're taking over myjob, too.

1025
01:22:55,552 --> 01:22:57,845
What's left for me, then, little bro?

1026
01:22:57,846 --> 01:22:59,179
What's left for...

1027
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:04,180
You were given everything
you ever wanted!

1028
01:23:05,145 --> 01:23:09,857
Now, Bob, go home!

1029
01:23:09,858 --> 01:23:12,526
I'm dug in here!

1030
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:13,027
Please!

1031
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:23,032
Put the gun down, Cameron.

1032
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:46,226
Lord almighty.

1033
01:23:46,227 --> 01:23:46,839
Ah, jeez.

1034
01:24:36,444 --> 01:24:41,444
<i>J' Well, I'm leaving in the morning J'.</i>

1035
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:46,449
<i>J' It just ain 't the same J'.</i>

1036
01:24:48,665 --> 01:24:53,665
<i>J' Yes, I'm leaving in the morning J'.</i>

1037
01:24:54,212 --> 01:24:59,212
<i>J' It just ain 't the same J'.</i>

1038
01:25:19,946 --> 01:25:22,239
Sarah.

1039
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,367
Got you some ice cream.

1040
01:25:25,368 --> 01:25:30,368
It's chocolate, your favorite.

1041
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:43,719
Hi.

1042
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,512
Cash, Billy.

1043
01:25:45,513 --> 01:25:49,099
Where's my cash?

1044
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,434
10 grand,

1045
01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:54,396
that's all I got from that lawyer.

1046
01:25:54,397 --> 01:25:56,857
You lying motherfucker.

1047
01:25:56,858 --> 01:26:01,858
Just take the fucking money,
and let us go!

1048
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:09,786
Athief like you...

1049
01:26:09,787 --> 01:26:11,413
spends weeks on end

1050
01:26:11,414 --> 01:26:13,415
baby-sitting little missy here...

1051
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:20,589
And 10 measly grand's
all you got to show for?

1052
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,719
How's our little bird doing, Billy?

1053
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,847
I gotta call you back.

1054
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:30,474
Stop!

1055
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:33,810
That's less than 20 cents
on every dollar you owe me.

1056
01:26:33,811 --> 01:26:36,772
What's he talking about, Billy?

1057
01:26:36,773 --> 01:26:38,774
Ha!

1058
01:26:38,775 --> 01:26:39,858
Aah!

1059
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:40,942
Your boyfriend here...

1060
01:26:42,362 --> 01:26:45,364
Stole half a kilo of my dope

1061
01:26:45,365 --> 01:26:47,866
to pay his gambling debts.

1062
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:52,371
So Billy and I had
a serious conversation

1063
01:26:52,372 --> 01:26:56,500
after I gave him a little whipping,

1064
01:26:56,501 --> 01:27:00,128
a reminder,
so he wouldn't forget.

1065
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:03,924
Now you know what to do,
you fuck.

1066
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:08,512
The nice guy that I am,

1067
01:27:08,513 --> 01:27:12,391
I let him have a chance
to redeem himself.

1068
01:27:12,392 --> 01:27:16,937
What am I gonna do?

1069
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:20,357
Billyjust needed to give you
a helping hand...

1070
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:21,983
Do you know what this is?

1071
01:27:21,984 --> 01:27:26,863
And collect your look-alike's...

1072
01:27:26,864 --> 01:27:28,865
Ellen's fortune.

1073
01:27:28,866 --> 01:27:30,409
Unbelievable.

1074
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:34,705
I mean,
you guys could be twins.

1075
01:27:34,706 --> 01:27:36,331
You were set up, Sarah.

1076
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:41,420
You look confused!

1077
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:44,715
Heh.

1078
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:46,925
You thought
I'd bought the farm that first night

1079
01:27:46,926 --> 01:27:49,344
when the bitch here
let that gun go off!

1080
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,560
Didn't you?

1081
01:27:56,561 --> 01:27:57,602
Fuck!

1082
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:08,109
God damn it!

1083
01:28:09,449 --> 01:28:14,449
Oh, my fucking heart!

1084
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:20,621
God damn, Billy.

1085
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:36,850
Rot in hell.

1086
01:29:25,733 --> 01:29:30,733
Was it true, what he said?

1087
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:36,823
It was my only chance to get out.

1088
01:29:45,127 --> 01:29:47,796
Do you know...

1089
01:29:47,797 --> 01:29:52,175
how sad it feels...

1090
01:29:52,176 --> 01:29:57,055
when somebody you really care for...

1091
01:29:57,056 --> 01:30:02,056
says just what you want to hear...

1092
01:30:03,813 --> 01:30:08,813
and none of it's true?

1093
01:30:13,155 --> 01:30:17,909
Every kiss...

1094
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:22,910
every <i>look...</i>

1095
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,920
nothing but a fairy tale.

1096
01:30:33,175 --> 01:30:37,888
But it was true.

1097
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:42,889
I loved you from the moment
I walked into Stanley's.

1098
01:30:44,562 --> 01:30:49,562
That was always true.

1099
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:54,567
It still is.

1100
01:30:58,743 --> 01:31:01,202
What's this?

1101
01:31:01,203 --> 01:31:04,497
Remember the painting?

1102
01:31:04,498 --> 01:31:07,876
The one above the fireplace.

1103
01:31:07,877 --> 01:31:11,296
Take it.

1104
01:31:11,297 --> 01:31:16,297
Apparently it's worth a few dollars.

1105
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:21,723
You get a fresh start.

1106
01:31:21,724 --> 01:31:26,724
Forget about me.

1107
01:31:27,438 --> 01:31:30,732
Like Eddie said...

1108
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:36,321
I'm good for nothin'.

1109
01:31:36,322 --> 01:31:39,908
You know what?

1110
01:31:39,909 --> 01:31:44,909
Screw Eddie.

1111
01:31:49,585 --> 01:31:54,585
<i>J' I was walking J'.</i>

1112
01:31:55,675 --> 01:32:00,675
<i>J' Late one night J'.</i>

1113
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:05,725
<i>J' I was walking J'.</i>

1114
01:32:05,726 --> 01:32:10,726
<i>J' Late one night J'.</i>

1115
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:16,945
<i>J' And I saw her standing there J'.</i>

1116
01:32:16,946 --> 01:32:21,946
<i>J' In the light J'</i>

1117
01:32:21,948 --> 01:33:21,948
