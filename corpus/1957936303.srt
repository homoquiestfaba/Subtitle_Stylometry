1
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:15,257
Sync and corrections by masaca

2
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,501
Run, Charlie, run!

3
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:22,595
We gotta get out of here.

4
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:33,339
Snake!

5
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,647
Spider!

6
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,023
Weird frilly thing!

7
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:09,108
We should have never
come back to Australia. It's not worth it.

8
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,611
Sure it is Louis.

9
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:14,807
It's worth anything to bring
Charlie and Louis' newest shampoo.

10
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:16,935
To the entire civilised world

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,341
Cut!

12
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:23,055
No, no, no! This is supposed
to be an action piece.

13
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,390
I'm not feeling it, people.

14
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,326
It was me, wasn't it?

15
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:28,394
I knew it.

16
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,095
I came in late on the hiss.

17
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,898
The coil felt all wrong.

18
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,666
It's always gotta be
about you, doesn't it?

19
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,671
Fellas, you're big, scaly guys!
Help me out here.

20
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,575
I need a real attack.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,115
Think "menace.

22
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,009
"Sheer terror.

23
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,478
Louis.

24
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:48,181
You were magnificent.

25
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:49,948
I laughed.

26
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,183
I cried.

27
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,752
I believed.

28
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:55,688
Excuse me, Jackie?

29
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:59,192
I mean, Mr. Legs.

30
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:00,727
How about me?

31
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:04,236
You were very good too, Charlie.

32
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:07,207
But what do you say, this time,
we give all your lines to Louis.

33
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,733
Yo, Mr. Director.

34
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,836
Nobody said nothing
about no stunt work.

35
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:15,074
I sprained four ankles when shampoo
boy there knocked me off his shoulder.

36
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:15,972
Ugh.

37
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:20,545
While we're at it, I don't like
the way you been talking to me.

38
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:21,347
Yeah.

39
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,517
Time someone
taught you a lesson.

40
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:25,751
Come on, mates.

41
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,353
It's all in good fun.

42
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:31,491
You wanna see terror?
How's this for terror?

43
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,946
- Jackie Legs is in trouble!
- What?

44
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:39,064
I had a dream.

45
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,366
We were shooting a
commercial for new shampoo.

46
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:44,836
"Dream," Louis.
Key word right there: dream.

47
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,372
Jackie Legs is not in trouble.

48
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,106
But it was so real.

49
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:51,209
I mean, other than the fact
that the animals were talking.

50
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,078
It makes perfect sense.

51
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,468
We're back in Australia.

52
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:58,545
To find a new shampoo formula so
our company doesn't go out of business.

53
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,384
And we're surrounded by kangaroos.

54
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,087
What else would you dream about?

55
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,989
I'd rather not say.

56
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,858
By the way, how was the commercial?

57
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:10,196
I'm not so sure about you,
but I was magnificent.

58
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,875
Hey, look!
There it is.

59
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,891
The ancient tribal land of the Marabuju's.

60
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,517
Where is everybody?

61
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,719
Hello.
Anybody home?

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,987
This is crazy, Charlie.

63
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:37,255
What are we doing here?

64
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:39,658
What do you mean, what are we doing here?

65
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,061
This whole trip was
your idea to begin with.

66
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,671
My idea?

67
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:47,566
All I said was that Jessie said she
heard of an aborigine medicine man.

68
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,574
.Chief "Hunky Tooty.

69
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,743
"-Ankamuti.

70
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:53,071
Right. Who knew more about
roots and berries than anybody in the world.

71
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,281
And?
What else did you say?

72
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:58,376
- That we should find "Funky Dooty"...
- Ankamuti.

73
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,845
And see if he could help us.

74
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,981
You don't feel this makes it your idea?

75
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,451
Not right now, I don't.

76
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,797
Who are you?

77
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,731
Louis Booker.

78
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:21,766
Brooklyn, New York.

79
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:25,111
And you must be the great "Chunky Booty.

80
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:26,883
Uh.

81
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,545
You'll have to excuse my friend.
He's in such awe of you.

82
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:37,016
You see, we have heard many
stories about you and your people.

83
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:40,485
- And your great wisdom.
- What is it you want?

84
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,587
We seek only shampoo.

85
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:47,112
And maybe a little conditioner thrown in.
Something fruity, if you got it.

86
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:48,894
See, our company's in trouble.

87
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:52,698
If you could point us to a
particularly sweet-smelling berry.

88
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,727
We might come up with a product...

89
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,102
- That...
- Silence!

90
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:01,007
Today is not a good day
to be seeking anything.

91
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:02,975
Follow me.

92
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,145
What's his problem?

93
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,339
I will show you my problem.

94
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,715
Man, that guy has good hearing.

95
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:12,451
Yes, I do.

96
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:14,053
Really good.

97
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:25,298
The power of the tribe has been stolen.

98
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:27,566
Man, I hate when that happens.

99
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,835
We are the keepers of the stones.

100
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:36,042
Long, long ago, the Skydwellers
entrusted us, with four sacred stones.

101
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:39,566
One as red as fire, one as blue as the sky.

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,282
One as green as the ocean
and one as black as night.

103
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:47,152
And now they have been taken.

104
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,460
Who did this?

105
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:52,725
An evil man with a smiling forehead.

106
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,686
And another carrying a snake on his arm.

107
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,865
Kind of chilly in here.

108
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:03,436
Only if the magic gems are returned,

109
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:07,298
will the gods once again
favor us with their wisdom.

110
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,942
Yeah, I could see how
that could be a problem.

111
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,218
It is you.

112
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,820
Oh, that's great.

113
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:22,813
What did you do this time Louis?

114
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,423
- And you.
- Me?

115
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,219
It can't be me.

116
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:27,892
Believe me, it's always him.

117
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:31,329
Chief, I'm sure there's been some mistake.

118
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,933
- No mistake.
- Hey, that's us.

119
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,603
It is written.
You are the chosen ones.

120
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,439
You will find the gems.

121
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,076
You will save our people.

122
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,581
- These guys?
- It is written.

123
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:51,951
Is it written anywhere how
we're supposed to do this?

124
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:55,654
Many years ago, there
was a great leak in the cave.

125
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:59,425
Unfortunately, that part
of the story is a little fuzzy.

126
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,160
Well, that's caves for you.

127
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,263
- Now, about that shampoo...
- Go!

128
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:11,303
What kind of chief uses the word "fuzzy"?

129
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,572
He's a great man.

130
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,374
He's a great lunatic, is what he is.

131
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,665
I mean, "chosen ones"?
Give me a break.

132
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,645
It's my fault, you guys.

133
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,004
All my ideas turn out bad.

134
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,950
I just don't have what it takes.

135
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:28,378
Oh, Louis.
I think you're being too hard on yourself.

136
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:32,124
I think he's being exactly the
right amount of hard on himself.

137
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,760
Oops.
Better fill up.

138
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:52,178
It's too bad.
I was really hoping the chief could help.

139
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:54,779
So much for our brilliant plan.

140
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,749
I guess we gotta go back
to New York and start over.

141
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,652
Come up with a better brilliant plan.

142
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,554
Well, don't look at me.

143
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,256
I'm done making plans.

144
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:08,452
No more brainstorms.
I have had my last idea.

145
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,763
No more for me!

146
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:19,371
Charlie, Jessie.
It's Jackie Legs.

147
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,674
Where?

148
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:25,344
Right there, with Mrs.
Legs and Jackie Junior.

149
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,781
- I don't think that's him.
- It's gotta be.

150
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:30,316
He looks just like him.

151
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:32,143
Look how he's looking at me.

152
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:35,020
They all look just like him.
They're kangaroos.

153
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,891
- Wait, I have an idea.
- I thought you were through with ideas.

154
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:40,659
Not now, Charlie.
I'm busy.

155
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,900
Jackie.

156
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,890
Jackie Legs.

157
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:53,939
I got your favorite.
Come on, boy.

158
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,774
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

159
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,980
Remember how he used to like licorice?

160
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,048
Well, sit back and watch.

161
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:05,751
Look at that.

162
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,090
I told you!
Didn't I tell you?

163
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:14,385
Jackie Legs.
We're together again.

164
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:15,961
Well, I'm still not convinced.

165
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:18,230
Jackie?
Is that you?

166
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,627
Yeah, that's Jackie Legs.

167
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:29,942
Got you again.

168
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:52,398
Jackie, stop!
It's too dangerous!

169
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,074
Jackie, wait!

170
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:56,786
- Hey, what are you guys doing?
- Easy, Charlie.

171
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:58,304
We gotta lay low.

172
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,974
These guys are poachers, not Boy Scouts.

173
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:04,843
The last thing they want are any witnesses.

174
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,930
Closer!
Closer!

175
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:34,306
Got you now, sweetheart!

176
00:11:58,531 --> 00:11:59,431
Got him!

177
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:01,767
Watch his feet!

178
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,659
Watch his feet!

179
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,741
In you go, tough guy.

180
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:29,128
This is terrible.
How can they do this?

181
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,629
I wonder where they taking him.

182
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,799
Probably hundreds of miles away.

183
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,335
Or not.

184
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,641
What's going on, Charlie?

185
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,610
How many guys are there?

186
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,478
Do they look tough?

187
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,947
- When do you think they'll go to sleep?
- Louis!

188
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:49,872
Sorry.

189
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,385
Look!
A campfire.

190
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,102
Think they got any marshmallows?
I'm starving.

191
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:57,896
Why don't you go down and ask.

192
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,527
Wait!
There's Jackie!

193
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:08,901
- We gotta do something.
- It could be dangerous.

194
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,137
I think it's pretty safe
to say it will be dangerous.

195
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:14,005
We got to, Charlie.

196
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,473
Jackie saved our life.

197
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,542
He's right.

198
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:20,112
What happened to the "laying
low" and the "no witnesses"?

199
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,705
Think of his beautiful wife.

200
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,539
And his poor baby, barely out of the pouch.

201
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:27,152
Trying to understand
what happened to Daddy.

202
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:29,643
- Forced to face the cruel, cold outback
- Please make it stop!

203
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,503
All by his lonesome self.

204
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:35,527
- And at night, when the predators come out...
- Okay, okay, we'll do it.

205
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,918
Now's our chance.

206
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,535
Come on, we gotta make this fast!

207
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:27,112
Jackie?
Jackie!

208
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,349
Definitely not Jackie.

209
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:33,452
- Let's check the other side.
- Here we go.

210
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:34,853
Last one.

211
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:35,949
Easy.

212
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,161
Easy.

213
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,458
Load this in and we can go home.

214
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:45,364
- There's no room.
- Sure there is.

215
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,866
We'll just slide these down.

216
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,703
Holy dooley, that's heavy.

217
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:52,930
What's in there?

218
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:54,773
Let's take a look.

219
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,283
It's one of those dang camels.
I'd know that smell anywhere.

220
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:09,154
It just keeps getting worse.

221
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:11,924
My bad.

222
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,266
Oh.

223
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,269
Louis, you're killing us.

224
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,413
That should do it.
Where these babies headed, anyway?

225
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:37,416
Las Vegas, Nevada. U.S.A.

226
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:39,851
This is great.
I've never been to Vegas.

227
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,387
- And now we're getting a free trip.
- Ow!

228
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,255
Louis, there is nothing great about this...

229
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,890
Ow! Will you stop that?

230
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,725
My cousin Ronald lives in Vegas.

231
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:50,229
He's an exterminator.
I'll give him a call.

232
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:53,232
Tell him to meet us at the airport.

233
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,467
He's a great guy.
You'll love him.

234
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,032
I can hardly wait.

235
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,203
Ow!

236
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,705
I think he likes you.

237
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,507
Las Vegas?

238
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:06,570
Who could possibly want all
these wild animals in Las Vegas?

239
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:09,146
Guess what, kids.

240
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:13,318
Next week, old Outback Ollie
has a really neat treat for you.

241
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:18,790
My special animal friends are flying in right
this minute. All the way from Australia.

242
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:24,596
That's right.
Just to meet all of you.

243
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:29,494
So be sure to tune in.
It's gonna be a snapping good time.

244
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,693
It's perfect.

245
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,161
- The whole place is deserted.
- Let's go.

246
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,290
Well, this is a new one.

247
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,000
Shipping yourself into
the country to pull a heist.

248
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,735
All these poor animals.

249
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:07,138
- I wish we could help them.
- Me too.

250
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,775
But it's gonna be hard enough
getting Jackie out of here.

251
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,457
Assuming we ever find him.

252
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,142
Yeah, I guess you're right.

253
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,550
Hey, here he is.

254
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,197
- Do we move in?
- No, stay out of sight.

255
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,733
They're gonna lead us straight to Mr. Big.

256
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:38,804
Look what I found!

257
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:40,632
What was the horn for, Louis?

258
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,191
A lot of traffic on the way over?

259
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:43,296
What's with him?

260
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,444
They must have tranquilized him for he trip.

261
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,246
So how do we get a
kangaroo out of the airport?

262
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,584
Have no fear, Louis Booker is here.

263
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,013
Give me your shades, Charlie.

264
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,554
What the heck are they doing?

265
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,289
I'm not sure.

266
00:17:57,582 --> 00:18:01,559
These guys are either
total idiots or geniuses.

267
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,961
There you go, Charlie.

268
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,462
Anybody see a kangaroo?

269
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:06,397
Nope, no kangaroos here.

270
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:08,699
Just three buddies sitting in a golf cart.

271
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,736
- Can we go now?
- Certainly, Charlie.

272
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,639
Take us to the first tee.

273
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:16,656
Idiots.

274
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,665
Red team, they're headed
for the north exit.

275
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:19,611
Be ready.

276
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,179
You're not gonna be happy, boss.

277
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,810
There's cops everywhere.

278
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:27,486
And a couple of cement-heads
with a girl are stealing our kangaroo.

279
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:29,492
You sure it's the one with the jewels?

280
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,531
Sure, I'm sure.
I can see the collar.

281
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,814
Now, you listen up and listen good.

282
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:39,297
Do whatever you have
to, but get that kangaroo.

283
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,945
Hey, coz.

284
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:49,674
Long time, no see.

285
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:50,763
Who's your friend?

286
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:53,056
No time for introductions.
We gotta go.

287
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:54,346
Same old Louis.

288
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,292
We're on him, sir.

289
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:25,016
Charlie and Jessie.

290
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,191
I've heard a lot about you.

291
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,295
Anything good?

292
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,413
No.

293
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,616
- How's your mom?
- She's doing good.

294
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,507
- I thought You're an exterminator?
- I got two jobs.

295
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:36,329
Exterminator and limo driver.

296
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:39,791
See, I kill rats and weasels by
day, drive them around by night.

297
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:41,626
- That's funny.
- Thanks.

298
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:46,864
So we just gonna keep pretending I don't have
a 200-pound kangaroo in the back of my car?

299
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,232
It's a long story.

300
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,569
- We're rescuing him.
- You're rescuing a kangaroo?

301
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,339
Ronald, can we borrow
your exterminator truck?

302
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:55,148
For what?

303
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,017
Well we can't very well
drive him to L.A. in a limo.

304
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:00,045
- I mean, when he wakes up...
- L.A.?

305
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,968
Nobody's looking for him there.

306
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,550
We gonna take him to the airport
and ship him home to Australia.

307
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:07,786
I have friends in Alice Springs
can get him back to his family.

308
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:10,121
Oh, I get it.

309
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:11,750
That is good.

310
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:16,328
It is always important to get
an animal back to his family.

311
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:19,405
- Ronald, what are you doing?
- I'm on TV, right?

312
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,932
This is one of them TV shows.

313
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:25,270
"See what happens when unsuspecting
Ronald finds a kangaroo in his limousine.

314
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,205
Subjects are three cars ahead.

315
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,032
Stay back, maintain surveillance.

316
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:31,877
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

317
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:35,827
- What's the deal with this collar?
- It's probably an ID tag.

318
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,316
Then why does it have all these bulges?

319
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,623
Sorry about that.
Hope I didn't break the camera.

320
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,481
Kangaroo in the car.

321
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:50,694
Lock the doors.

322
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:51,897
Easy, boy.

323
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:54,900
Easy.

324
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,108
This party limo rules, man!

325
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:30,101
Hey, dude. Major party tonight.
Room 305. The Aztec. Be there.

326
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:36,908
Jackie, no!

327
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:51,790
Awesome. The Russian
judge gives that dude a 10.

328
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:57,342
Moving out!

329
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,864
Check out the hops!

330
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,832
I hope he shows.

331
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:03,168
I definitely wanna party with that dude.

332
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,342
Oh, that's not good.

333
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,397
Huh?

334
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,401
Look, he's coming back.

335
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:37,969
And he's going again.

336
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:39,262
We can't let him get away.

337
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:40,923
Any suggestions?

338
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,641
Run!

339
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,395
I'd just like to give a shout
out to Ray Ray and Tiny D.

340
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,878
And all my peeps down at the pool hall.

341
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,352
Keep it real, y'all.

342
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:03,160
There they go.

343
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:04,429
Come on, let's move.

344
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:05,696
Move?

345
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,587
I haven't even stretched.

346
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:09,667
Know how many muscles I could pull?

347
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:13,004
How's about I pull your
nose muscle right off your face?

348
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,153
Welcome to the Conquistador.

349
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:31,155
Registration is to the left.

350
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,825
Cabanas are available by the pool.

351
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,868
Look!
Over there.

352
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,171
What?
Do you see him?

353
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,013
No.

354
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,375
The heavyweight champion
of the world is fighting tonight.

355
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:52,777
Right in this hotel!

356
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:55,779
Excuse me?

357
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,247
Killer Putulski.

358
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:59,383
He's my all-time favorite.

359
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:02,019
Think back, Louis.
Real hard.

360
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,724
- We were chasing a kangaroo, remember?
- I know that.

361
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:06,857
I'm chasing.

362
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,594
I just happen to be able
to do two things at once.

363
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,564
Louis, you can't do one thing at once.

364
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:13,665
Um um.

365
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:14,732
We gotta split up.

366
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,167
It's our best chance.

367
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,471
Poor little guy.

368
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,639
He's never been around this many people.

369
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,509
He's probably scared to death.

370
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:51,669
Hey!

371
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,029
Eh! You with the tail!

372
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:36,147
- I got nothing. You?
- Nothing.

373
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,048
He could be anywhere by now.

374
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:40,852
He could be in another
hotel for all we know.

375
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:42,587
I feel so helpless.

376
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,223
I wonder if we'll ever see him again.

377
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:46,544
Ah!

378
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,182
A kangaroo!

379
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,160
Oh, my gosh!

380
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,009
Look over there!

381
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:53,109
I don't believe it.
Somebody do something!

382
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,386
Security?
We have a situation.

383
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:57,902
What's the big deal?

384
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:01,706
Creature in the food court!

385
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,878
What is that, a giraffe?

386
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:10,648
- What is he doing?
- I don't know, but he's not a giraffe.

387
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,093
There he is.

388
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:09,541
Hold it right there!

389
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:12,343
We got you now, fur ball.

390
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:43,408
Ow!

391
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,845
Louis, I just got hit in the
head by a flying roast beef.

392
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,181
I got my own problems, Charlie.

393
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:56,521
Guys, he's getting away!

394
00:28:12,363 --> 00:28:13,137
Huh?

395
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:16,607
This is why I love Vegas.

396
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,076
They got everything.

397
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,781
Oh, no.

398
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,953
You don't happen to have any
gravy on you anywhere, do you?

399
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:30,488
Thanks.

400
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:32,056
Mmm.

401
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,006
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Hotel security coming through.

402
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,407
Oh. Terribly sorry, ma'am.

403
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:52,510
Official business.
Kangaroo wrangler.

404
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,848
Jessie, go find Ronald
and meet us round back.

405
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:59,324
Catching Jackie's one thing.
Getting him out of here's another.

406
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:00,351
Gotcha.

407
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,868
Charlie, I don't like this place.

408
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:24,142
Well, either the kangaroo's been here.

409
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:27,312
Or this joint's got the
worst busboys in Vegas.

410
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,750
Hey, I think I found a door.

411
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:36,888
I hear something.

412
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:38,623
Sounds like breathing.

413
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:40,391
Jackie, is that you?

414
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,695
Jackie, please say that's you.

415
00:29:43,702 --> 00:29:45,962
Make a kangaroo noise or something.

416
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:46,819
Please?

417
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,800
Just for your old buddy Louis.

418
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:51,802
Hey, Charlie, he's licking me.

419
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:53,237
He must be happy to see us.

420
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:55,573
I don't think kangaroos do that.

421
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,277
Louis, I feel a wall.

422
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,546
I got a light switch.
This is good.

423
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,248
No, Charlie.

424
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:06,350
This is bad.

425
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,419
This is really bad.

426
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:11,222
Don't make any sudden moves.

427
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:13,522
Does peeing in my pants
count as a sudden move?

428
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,606
Don't drop me, Charlie.

429
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,493
Wait a minute.

430
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:17,941
Louis take your clothes off.

431
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,496
You take your clothes off.

432
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:21,698
No, he smells the roast beef.

433
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:24,836
The turkey from the buffet.
That's what he's after.

434
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:25,929
Nice kitty.

435
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:27,672
Pretty kitty.

436
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:30,035
Wouldn't hurt the nice men, would you?

437
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,362
No, we're stinky.

438
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:35,213
You want the yummy clothes.
That's what you want.

439
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:47,358
It's Jackie!

440
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,563
Did I say Jackie?
I meant jacket.

441
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,453
Enjoy the nice jacket.

442
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,922
Plenty of juice.

443
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:57,395
Careful, Jackie!

444
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,904
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!

445
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:01,606
Hey, you two!

446
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,707
What do you think you're doing?

447
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,511
Turn out the lights when you leave.

448
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,349
Run, boy!
Run!

449
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,786
Way to go, Jackie!

450
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:17,280
That was close.

451
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:23,361
He doesn't look real happy.

452
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,900
I think we could be here for a while.

453
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:34,605
Unless, of course, the cage starts
floating in the air for no apparent reason.

454
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:49,220
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we present, for your entertainment.

455
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:54,784
An ancient feat of magic,
passed down from the great Pharaohs.

456
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:12,008
Where once there was a beautiful girl.

457
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:16,848
Now prowls a majestic beast.

458
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:20,184
Ah!
Hello.

459
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:27,785
Holy moly, I don't believe it.

460
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,862
Me neither. I didn't even know
they was in show business.

461
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:38,736
See, if we could just explain. My friend
Charlie and I, we're the chosen ones.

462
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,109
And stay out.

463
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:47,536
You're just lucky Gary's in a good mood.

464
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,947
I don't feel lucky.

465
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:51,749
Funny, neither do I.

466
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,059
Where's the kangaroo?

467
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,383
- We lost him.
- Which way did he go?

468
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:07,344
We have no idea.

469
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:08,899
Well, then, tell me this.

470
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,567
How come you're half naked?

471
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:14,738
Well, if you must know, we were
trapped in a cage with a panther.

472
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:17,874
And the only way we could save
ourselves was by taking off our clothes.

473
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:18,776
Ta-da!

474
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,647
Fine. You don't wanna tell me,
don't tell me.

475
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,018
Don't start.

476
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:32,557
Okay, seriously, how
come you're in your underwear?

477
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:40,598
CDR249.
Got it.

478
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:43,701
Now, if we could just figure
out where that kangaroo went.

479
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:55,045
What a night it has
been at the Conquistador.

480
00:33:55,046 --> 00:34:00,651
One more round to decide the
heavyweight championship of the world.

481
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:04,388
So strap yourselves in, folks, here we go!

482
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,526
A right!
A left!

483
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,026
Another left!

484
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:13,031
And oh!
A kiss to the forehead!

485
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,331
Who would have thought it?

486
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,796
The thunder from down under,
this unheralded kid

487
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:20,270
from the outback is taking it to the champ.

488
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,139
And Killer is clearly frustrated.

489
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,844
He's been chasing the young challenger
for 15 rounds and he is starting to tire.

490
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:30,548
Stand still so's I can "murdalize" you.

491
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,743
Things are getting kanga-licious!

492
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:35,571
Just look at the footwork
on this gutsy little roo.

493
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,364
Hey, come back here!

494
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:38,321
Come back!

495
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:39,390
Oh, mate.

496
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,991
And Killer is down!
He is down!

497
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:23,761
That's it, folks. We have a new
heavyweight champion of the world...

498
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:27,429
...and his name is Kangaroo Jack.

499
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:33,296
You did it, Jackie, you did it!
You did it!

500
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:37,334
You did it, Jackie!
You did it!

501
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,204
What are you doing?

502
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,438
How did I end up on the floor?

503
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:45,476
You didn't end up on the
floor, you ended up on me.

504
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,511
Now, roll your big butt off of me.

505
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,613
What a dream!

506
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:55,085
Jackie Legs won the heavyweight championship
of the world, and I was his manager.

507
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,444
Was I in the dream?

508
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,289
Oh, sure.
I think you were a towel boy.

509
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,658
Towel boy?

510
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,896
Oh-oh.
I smell sausage!

511
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,633
Good to see you're finally up.

512
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:12,703
You guys might wanna watch this.
We're on TV.

513
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:17,073
Our top story began last
night, here at the Las Vegas airport.

514
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:21,077
In a daring heist, smugglers
escaped an FBI stakeout...

515
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:23,279
...and made off with a prized kangaroo...

516
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,584
...carrying an untold
amount of priceless jewels.

517
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:28,919
Jewels?
What are they talking about?

518
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:31,622
We now go to FBI Agent Jackson.

519
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:32,989
We got a tip.

520
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,313
Person or persons believed to be
connected with organized crime...

521
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:39,562
...have been using animals
to smuggle gems into the country.

522
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,698
The kangaroo was their latest attempt.

523
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:45,062
The kangaroo, who was
ticketed for the animal sanctuary...

524
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:49,173
...run by famed TV host
and animal lover Outback Ollie...

525
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:54,970
...then engineered an escape of his own on
the Las Vegas Strip and is still at large.

526
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:56,946
They haven't found Jackie yet.

527
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:59,515
We go now to TV host Outback Ollie.

528
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,684
I don't care a lick about any smugglers.

529
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:03,786
I'm just worried about my little roo.

530
00:39:03,787 --> 00:39:06,522
My poor, defenseless little roo.

531
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:10,260
The smugglers, pictured here,
are believed to have connections...

532
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:13,664
...to the infamous Maggio
crime syndicate in New York.

533
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:14,757
Hey, that's us.

534
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:18,034
In fact, Charlie Carbone is the stepson...

535
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:21,004
...of none other than
Mafia kingpin Sal Maggio.

536
00:39:21,005 --> 00:39:24,674
Clearly, the apple does
not fall far from the tree.

537
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,142
I don't believe this.

538
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:32,283
Also involved, a large emu, although
authorities are not quite sure how.

539
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:34,284
This is not good.

540
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:35,718
What are they talking about?

541
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,021
What jewels?

542
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:40,990
Oh, no. The collar.
Jackie's collar.

543
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:42,759
That's what all those bumps must have been.

544
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,761
The jewels.

545
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:46,229
Jewels?
Did you say jewels?

546
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,512
Listen, if we're talking
gems here, I want in.

547
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:50,059
You know, my slice of the pie.

548
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:52,419
After all, I did drive the getaway car.

549
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:56,228
And even though y'all held
out on me, I'm willing to forgive.

550
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:59,410
We don't have any jewels, Ronald.

551
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,844
Oh, so it's like that, is it?

552
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:07,005
- We didn't smuggle any jewels.
- No, but somebody else did,

553
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,054
and we got in the way.

554
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:18,228
Hello?

555
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,367
Oh, hello, Mrs. Sperling.

556
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:23,067
It's this crazy customer of mine.

557
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:26,670
She's got her house booby-trapped,
waiting for aliens from outer space.

558
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,966
I'm sorry, what was that, Mrs. Sperling?

559
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:33,777
Uh-huh. Well, trust me, there's no
such thing as a 6-foot red possum.

560
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:37,114
and even if there was, they
don't sit on their hind legs.

561
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:40,651
Mrs. Sperling, I'll be right out.

562
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:48,038
Here, put these on.

563
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:49,360
I'll load up the truck.

564
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:56,233
With our luck, it'll probably turn
out to be a 6-foot-tall red possum.

565
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:59,370
Ronald, what did you forget?

566
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,353
Charlie Carbone?
We need to talk.

567
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,008
You just missed him.

568
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:07,854
Maybe if you come
back in, oh, say, two days...

569
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,046
Yeah, right.

570
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:12,549
- Mr. Carbone?
- Yes, sir.

571
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,684
There you are, Charlie.

572
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,433
I've been looking all over for you!

573
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,521
I believe you know what this is about.

574
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:19,555
The jewels?

575
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:20,484
Exactly.

576
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:24,928
You see we were looking for a new shampoo,
and then we ran into Jackie Legs.

577
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:26,429
He's the kangaroo.

578
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,297
Yes, sir, what she said.

579
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:33,102
He's the kangaroo and he's our
friend and we gave him red licorice.

580
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:36,796
And then we tried to save him, but
we ended up in a box with a big bird,

581
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:39,143
who kept pecking Charlie on the head and.

582
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,312
Do you mind if I get a drink?

583
00:41:43,313 --> 00:41:44,575
I'm kind of parched.

584
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:45,355
Go ahead.

585
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,137
I get that way all the time.

586
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,741
Look, don't get the wrong idea.
We're here to help.

587
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:53,723
We know you didn't
pack those gems in Australia.

588
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:54,991
That's right.

589
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:58,995
So just turn them over to us and
we'll straighten this whole thing out,

590
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:00,664
and get the real bad guys.

591
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:03,600
We don't have them.
But we know where they are.

592
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:04,435
Where?

593
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,842
Louis, are you out of your mind?

594
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,944
You just assaulted two cops.

595
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,179
Do you know how much trouble we're in now?

596
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,549
- They were helping us.
- I don't think so.

597
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,618
I've been chased by a lot of cops,

598
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:24,246
but none of them
wearing high-top sneakers.

599
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:26,878
Hey!

600
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:30,793
Charlie! It's the man
with the smiling forehead!

601
00:42:30,794 --> 00:42:31,561
What?

602
00:42:31,562 --> 00:42:34,064
And the guy with a snake on his arm.

603
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:37,100
Just like Chief Ankamuti described.

604
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:42,138
Then the jewels in Jackie's collar
must be the gems stolen from the tribe.

605
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,273
And these are the guys who stole them.

606
00:42:44,274 --> 00:42:45,397
Which means...

607
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,945
We gotta get to Jackie
before anyone else does.

608
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:50,714
If we can get the jewels,
we can prove we're innocent.

609
00:42:50,723 --> 00:42:51,714
Otherwise...

610
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:54,685
We may be going to
prison for a very long time.

611
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:58,554
No, what it means is, we
got nothing to worry about.

612
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:03,727
Don't you see, Charlie?
We are the chosen ones.

613
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:06,346
Right.
The chosen ones.

614
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:07,798
Good thinking, Louis.

615
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:16,340
I guess Ronald wants
his slice to be the whole pie.

616
00:43:17,622 --> 00:43:18,609
Now what?

617
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,627
Address book, keys to the limo.

618
00:43:22,647 --> 00:43:23,914
Let's do it.

619
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:35,993
Don't mess with the chosen ones.

620
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:51,642
How can you possibly be
whistling at a time like this?

621
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:54,378
You're not getting it, are you, Charlie?

622
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:59,048
We are the chosen ones.
Nothing can stop us.

623
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:03,319
Remember what Chief
"Tutti-Frutti" said: "It is written.

624
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,355
That was just a legend, a myth.

625
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:07,891
A myth, huh?

626
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,551
Let's look at the facts.

627
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:13,095
If I hadn't let one fly in
the crate back in Australia.

628
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:16,566
...those poachers would have found
us and we would've been dead meat.

629
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:18,969
But I did let one fly.

630
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,372
We escaped a stakeout at the
airport that we didn't even know was there.

631
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:27,543
We survived a face-to-face
encounter with a vicious panther.

632
00:44:27,544 --> 00:44:32,048
I knocked out two fake cops
with one frying pan, twice.

633
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:36,586
If that's not enough, Ronald probably
has three customers to his name.

634
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:41,090
And one of them calls and practically
hands us Jackie Legs on a platter.

635
00:44:41,091 --> 00:44:44,261
I'm telling you, we're invincible.

636
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:47,763
- You can't really believe this.
- Oh, yes, I do.

637
00:44:47,764 --> 00:44:49,646
It's as obvious as the nose on your...

638
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:50,701
- Louis!
- Louis!

639
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:06,216
Whew.

640
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,187
See?
"It is written.

641
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:30,807
Oh.

642
00:45:32,236 --> 00:45:33,398
Written.

643
00:45:33,422 --> 00:45:34,907
What kind of thing is that Louis?

644
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,420
You come flying through the
trees, tearing up my car.

645
00:45:37,447 --> 00:45:39,516
Man, I still got two payments left.

646
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,018
Uh-huh.

647
00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:42,985
Look how you dented it up.

648
00:45:42,986 --> 00:45:46,377
- Thanks for waiting back at the apartment.
- Oh, that.

649
00:45:46,402 --> 00:45:49,205
Yeah right.
Well, y'all was taking so long,

650
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:51,427
and I knew time was of
the essence, you understand,

651
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:54,230
so I made what you
call an executive decision.

652
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:56,855
I was doing you a favor,
trying to get here quick.

653
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,603
So we could get the reward
for the kangaroo and split it.

654
00:45:59,717 --> 00:46:01,571
Who said anything about a reward?

655
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:04,174
Did I say reward?

656
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:08,078
I meant, saving your friend the
kangaroo was reward enough for me.

657
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,246
You know I wasn't even
thinking about the jewels.

658
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,349
Because that's not even an issue.

659
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:21,792
What took you so long, and
who are all these people?

660
00:46:21,939 --> 00:46:24,161
They're not spacemen, are they?

661
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:26,096
No, ma'am.

662
00:46:26,357 --> 00:46:27,698
Time travelers?

663
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:28,731
Not at all.

664
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:30,810
They're my assistants.

665
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:34,799
I knew this was gonna be a big
job, so I brought in the whole team.

666
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:38,140
Well, the creature's
still out in the back yard.

667
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:40,844
Neil kept him at bay as best he could.

668
00:46:43,461 --> 00:46:44,948
We'll get right on it.

669
00:46:46,257 --> 00:46:47,150
Huh?

670
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:51,355
Jackie, Jackie Legs.
Look what I got.

671
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:53,724
It's your favorite.
Candy.

672
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:02,351
Charlie, help me!

673
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,735
Help you?
Help me!

674
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:05,843
Hey!

675
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,566
Ronald!
Jessie!

676
00:47:07,597 --> 00:47:08,665
Crazy lady?

677
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,039
Somebody cut us down.

678
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,942
Jackie, no.
Don't go!

679
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:16,713
Man, we were this close.

680
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:20,316
Look at those beautiful
gems hopping off into the sunset.

681
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:21,752
A little help, please!

682
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:25,922
Well, Neil, I gotta hand it to you,
I didn't think that trap would work.

683
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,492
My apologies.

684
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:32,662
- Are you guys all right?
- Do we look all right?

685
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,834
Well, you guys can sit moping if you
want, but since it no longer appears

686
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:47,696
that I'm going to be a
wealthy diamond merchant.

687
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,479
I gotta go to work.

688
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,184
Any ideas, O chosen one?

689
00:47:57,228 --> 00:47:58,088
Yep.

690
00:47:58,202 --> 00:48:00,323
Him.
Outback Ollie.

691
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,827
If anyone can help us catch
a kangaroo, it's that man there.

692
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:12,602
She's a real cutie-patootie, that one.

693
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,271
Very cute.
An absolute doll.

694
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:17,340
So how can I help you folks?

695
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,743
Well, you see, sir...

696
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,278
You look familiar.

697
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,748
- Have we met?
- No. But we're big fans, of course.

698
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:28,884
Wait a minute, you're
the blokes on the news.

699
00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:30,654
The smugglers who stole me roo.

700
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:31,988
You must be mistaken.

701
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,292
Save it, mate. I know who you
are and I know what you did.

702
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:38,587
That's right.
We're the ones who stole your kangaroo.

703
00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:39,361
Louis!

704
00:48:39,362 --> 00:48:43,799
The truth is: we were there when the
poachers dragged him from his family.

705
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,102
We were trying to do the right thing
and return him to where he belongs.

706
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,907
As for the jewels, the first we heard
about them was on TV, just like you.

707
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:54,210
- It's true, sir.
- Suppose it is.

708
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:55,244
Why come to me?

709
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:57,402
You see, we almost caught Jackie...

710
00:48:57,426 --> 00:48:59,949
That's our name for the kangaroo.
Jackie Legs

711
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,951
We almost caught him this morning...

712
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:03,686
You know where he is?

713
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:04,787
Sort of.

714
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:07,923
Last we saw, he was headed
west out of town, across the desert.

715
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:11,561
He's wearing my lucky red jacket.
You can't hardly miss him.

716
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:15,952
Seems we all want the same
thing, the safe return of Jackie Legs.

717
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,166
Then you'll help us?

718
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,390
I like a man who stands
up and tell the truth.

719
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,622
I'll be happy to help.

720
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,940
When we catch the guy,
I'll ship him home myself.

721
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:25,400
This is great.

722
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,347
Now, if Jackie's out on the desert,
my guess is he'll head for water.

723
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:33,015
And the only water out there is Lake Mead.

724
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:34,985
I'll get you fixed up
with everything you need.

725
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:39,655
Walkie-talkies, check.
Binoculars, check.

726
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:41,357
Ropes, check.

727
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,158
You folks head on out to the lake.

728
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:45,060
I've got some things I have to do here.

729
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:46,763
I'll meet you as soon as I can.

730
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,732
Now get a move on.

731
00:50:01,878 --> 00:50:05,214
Sorry, boss.
We should've taken care of them last time.

732
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:06,382
We won't miss again.

733
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:09,286
Not so fast.
I have a better idea.

734
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,923
We're gonna end up with the jewels,
they're gonna end up with the blame.

735
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:14,757
They are?

736
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:18,161
All's we gotta do is get to the lake
before they do.

737
00:50:18,194 --> 00:50:21,665
Thanks to the helicopter, that
shouldn't be much of a problem.

738
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:25,835
- I don't get it.
- Just wait 30 minutes and call the cops.

739
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,329
What are you doing, boss?

740
00:50:27,744 --> 00:50:30,040
A small sacrifice.

741
00:50:31,635 --> 00:50:36,214
The jewels on the kangaroo are worth
a thousand times what these are worth.

742
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,051
You see, the cops want jewels,
so that's exactly what we'll give them.

743
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,023
You just have to have
a little finesse, that's all.

744
00:50:54,664 --> 00:50:56,099
Nice touch.

745
00:50:57,341 --> 00:50:59,603
Why does this have to happen now?

746
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:09,365
- Quit Bugging Me.
- What do you mean, quit bugging you?

747
00:51:09,404 --> 00:51:10,939
I'm your cousin, dog.

748
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:13,550
No man, "Quit Bugging Me.
" That's the company name.

749
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:16,098
Ronald, we're at Outback Ollie's.

750
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:18,654
We need a ride to Lake Mead.
The limo broke.

751
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,989
The limo broke?

752
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,491
Yeah, I think you got a defective car.

753
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,393
The point is, we're desperate.

754
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:27,044
We think Jackie's out by Lake
Mead and we gotta get him.

755
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:29,531
I can't just take off
in the middle of the day like that.

756
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:30,699
I got customers.

757
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,235
These are important people.

758
00:51:32,978 --> 00:51:36,139
- Ronald!
- I'm sorry, coz. No can do.

759
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:39,709
Lake Mead.

760
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:47,717
What a cool guy that Outback
Ollie is, letting us take this jeep.

761
00:51:47,742 --> 00:51:49,508
Everything's working out.

762
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:52,288
We are the chosen ones.

763
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:08,170
Okay, dude, let's see what you got.

764
00:52:08,171 --> 00:52:11,740
Start with, like, a nosebone,
then go skeezer, slurpy.

765
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,809
No, slurpy, skeezer.

766
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,847
Then, tantrum to fakie and
end with a frontside tweety-bird.

767
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:22,052
Hold on, dude, this is gonna be so tight.

768
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:29,926
Whoa, wildlife in a jacket!

769
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,869
Excellent.

770
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,780
There he is.

771
00:52:52,142 --> 00:52:53,349
Tear it up!

772
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:55,584
Whoa!

773
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:57,420
Quick, Charlie!
Get him!

774
00:53:10,967 --> 00:53:14,637
- Do you see what I see?
- No, I don't believe it.

775
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:16,563
It's the dude from the limo!

776
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:20,844
Hey, dude.
Missed you at the party last night!

777
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,113
Where were you, buddy?

778
00:53:23,527 --> 00:53:27,383
Okay, he's skiing.
The kangaroo is skiing away.

779
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:28,884
We can't just stand here.

780
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:30,185
We don't have to.

781
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:32,689
Look.
The keys are still in it.

782
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:41,697
Okay, here's the plan. You guys drive,
I'll ski up next to Jackie and grab him.

783
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:42,926
Oh it's foolproof.

784
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,702
Other than the fact you can't
water-ski, what could go wrong?

785
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:49,305
Hello, how hard could it be?

786
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:54,444
A kangaroo picked it up in three seconds.

787
00:54:11,575 --> 00:54:15,231
It's hard!
Very hard!

788
00:54:17,374 --> 00:54:20,470
Charlie!
We need a new plan!

789
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:25,108
Whoa!
Ooh.

790
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:01,199
Tear it up!

791
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:04,113
This dude's hardcore, man.

792
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:05,910
- Slow down!
- Stop!

793
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,737
Look at those dudes, man, they are intense.

794
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:13,690
Wait! Wait!
We need our kangaroo!

795
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,224
What did he say?

796
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:18,093
I think he said, "Race, race.

797
00:55:18,094 --> 00:55:19,896
We need to see who rules.

798
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,297
Excellent.

799
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah.

800
00:55:28,144 --> 00:55:29,606
What are they doing?

801
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:31,661
This is so cool!

802
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:33,776
Will you slow down?

803
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,450
Hey!

804
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:52,228
Oh.

805
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:53,630
Hmm.

806
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:07,110
All right!

807
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:16,526
Oh-oh.

808
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:18,787
Ah.

809
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:24,360
Thank you.

810
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,199
We're gaining on them.

811
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,635
This is our chance!

812
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:36,039
Almost got him.

813
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:38,708
Is that...?

814
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:39,876
It is!

815
00:56:40,724 --> 00:56:42,812
How do you stop these things?

816
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:43,947
Whoa!

817
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:06,536
Louis!

818
00:57:09,412 --> 00:57:11,774
Man overboard!

819
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:18,380
All right!
Victory is ours.

820
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:22,617
A worthy challenger, and
yet we remain undefeated.

821
00:57:22,618 --> 00:57:24,287
As it must be.

822
00:57:30,286 --> 00:57:32,295
We had him, Louis.
We had him.

823
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:34,163
Until Ronald messed it up.

824
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,432
I don't think so.

825
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:40,136
Look! It's Outback Ollie and his guys.

826
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,072
Huh?

827
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,774
Oh.

828
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,947
Messed it up perfect, I'd say.

829
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,254
Was there ever any doubt?

830
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:01,324
There you go, Jackie.
Home at last.

831
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:02,939
Now we gotta work fast.

832
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:07,530
Put him in the cage.
Switch this, and get me the red jacket.

833
00:58:08,445 --> 00:58:10,098
This is beautiful.

834
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:12,295
Now all we have to do is
get the collar from Jackie,

835
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,936
and turn the gems over to the police.

836
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,471
Our troubles are over.

837
00:58:16,486 --> 00:58:17,827
Hallelujah!

838
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:28,518
Ew.

839
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:37,794
What are you looking at,
you mangy, overgrown rat?

840
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:49,859
- Hello, mates.
- Outback Ollie, I love you.

841
00:58:49,884 --> 00:58:51,239
You are the man.

842
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,242
Team effort, boys, team effort.

843
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,277
That's quite a roo, your friend Jackie.

844
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:56,845
Yeah, he sure is.

845
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:59,837
Listen, would you mind if
we talk to him for a second?

846
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:01,416
I mean, you know, petted him.

847
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,785
Just to calm him down.

848
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:06,089
I'm not too sure he's
in the mood for visitors.

849
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,193
But you know him better than I do.

850
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:14,984
By the way, I believe
this belongs to you, Louis.

851
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:15,965
Thanks.

852
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:18,788
Did I mention this is my lucky jacket?

853
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:20,487
You did indeed.

854
00:59:28,906 --> 00:59:30,947
Hold it right there!
Nobody move.

855
00:59:34,303 --> 00:59:38,086
No, no. Officers, this is all a big mix-up.

856
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:43,192
If you check the collar on the kangaroo,
I promise we can straighten out everything.

857
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:48,436
This is really funny if you think about it.
I mean we're totally innocent.

858
00:59:48,437 --> 00:59:51,033
- But I'm sure to you, we seem...
- Nothing here, sir.

859
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:53,624
Incredibly guilty.

860
00:59:53,648 --> 00:59:56,004
There has to be a mistake, officer.

861
00:59:56,005 --> 00:59:57,540
I'm sure there is.

862
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:01,577
Care to explain these?

863
01:00:03,606 --> 01:00:04,447
Louis?

864
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,316
- Louis?
- No, not really.

865
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,919
Let's go, you're all under arrest.

866
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,021
I don't know what to say officers.

867
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,822
They seemed like good blokes.

868
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:18,935
I wasn't sure if calling you was the thing
to do. But I reckon now it's lucky I did.

869
01:00:18,942 --> 01:00:20,217
You got that right, sir.

870
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,298
But I don't think you understand.

871
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:23,840
You can't do this.

872
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:27,637
You see, my friend Charlie
and I, we're the chosen ones.

873
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:29,793
No kidding.

874
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:30,895
I'll tell you what:

875
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:34,944
I'll let you choose which
cell we throw you in.

876
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,412
Get them out of here.

877
01:00:39,422 --> 01:00:42,552
You're not really shipping that
kangaroo to Australia, are you?

878
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:46,856
I could, but I think it would be
cheaper to feed him to the crocs, don't you?

879
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,425
Hey, look.
It's them!

880
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,760
- The fake cops!
- Are you sure?

881
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,030
Yeah, right there.
I'm positive.

882
01:00:57,814 --> 01:01:00,202
Wait, they're with Outback Ollie.

883
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:02,637
- I don't understand.
- -Me neither.

884
01:01:02,638 --> 01:01:04,105
Well, don't look at me.

885
01:01:04,106 --> 01:01:07,276
I'm still trying to figure out
how those jewels got in my pocket.

886
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:13,591
G'day, boys and girls!

887
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:15,938
G'day, Outback Ollie!

888
01:01:15,945 --> 01:01:18,286
What a show we have for you today.

889
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:21,324
A show of Australian all-stars.

890
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:27,395
Kenny the koala, Eric the echidna,
and our special guest, Jackie Legs,

891
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:31,467
the most amazing kangaroo
you've ever laid your eyes on.

892
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:39,207
Who had time to switch the
collar before we got to shore?

893
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:40,710
Outback Ollie.

894
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:44,813
And who handed Louis the red jacket
with those jewels planted in the pocket?

895
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:46,337
Outback Ollie.

896
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:50,186
And whose van did the guys who
stole the gems in Australia get out of?

897
01:01:50,193 --> 01:01:51,886
Outback Ollie!

898
01:01:51,887 --> 01:01:54,624
You're right!
Now it all makes sense.

899
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,126
The guys who stole the
gems from the aborigines,

900
01:01:57,151 --> 01:02:01,796
are trying to get them back and
they think Outback Ollie has them.

901
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:04,567
Oh, no, Outback Ollie is in trouble!

902
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:08,336
Outback Ollie is behind everything.

903
01:02:08,337 --> 01:02:10,905
He's the smuggler, and he framed us.

904
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:13,576
Didn't quite connect the
dots on that one, did you, Louis?

905
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:23,019
Guard! Guard!
We need a lawyer!

906
01:02:24,353 --> 01:02:26,022
You guys get one phone call.

907
01:02:27,338 --> 01:02:28,623
One's all I need.

908
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:30,293
I'll be right back.

909
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:32,629
I know we're right.

910
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:35,965
- If only we could prove it.
- Don't worry, I'll think of something.

911
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:42,704
- Hello?
- Charlie.

912
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:45,907
What's the name of that
lawyer, the one that's always on TV?

913
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:47,765
I have no idea what you're talking about.

914
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:51,101
Louis, please tell me this
isn't your one phone call.

915
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,080
Oops.

916
01:02:52,081 --> 01:02:53,148
My bad.

917
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,518
Hey, you.
You can't have that phone in here.

918
01:02:57,601 --> 01:02:58,902
Everybody clear out!

919
01:02:58,915 --> 01:03:00,577
We got an infestation here.

920
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:03,668
- What are you talking about?
- Roaches man.

921
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:06,394
You got roaches running
up and down this whole place.

922
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:07,663
And termites too.

923
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:08,919
Big termites.

924
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:13,757
Just eating up everything,
walls and floors and shoes and...

925
01:03:13,781 --> 01:03:15,503
Nobody told me anything.

926
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:16,939
I got a work order right here.

927
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,775
Straight from the chief of police himself.

928
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,478
The man said, "gas the place,"
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

929
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:32,654
What are you coughing about?

930
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:36,224
- It's dry ice and grape juice.
- I can't believe this.

931
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:37,592
What are you doing here?

932
01:03:37,593 --> 01:03:41,664
Hey, I might have tried to beat
you to the jewels, but we're still blood.

933
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:43,833
Ronald?

934
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:47,257
Here, put these on.

935
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,506
We're getting out of here.
We got a smuggler to catch.

936
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:57,312
And this, boys and girls, is
a northern hairy-nosed wombat,

937
01:03:57,313 --> 01:04:00,516
the most endangered
mammal in all of Australia.

938
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,119
Can anyone name
another endangered creature?

939
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:06,847
Yeah. You, Ollie. After
we get through with you.

940
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:10,725
That's right. You're gonna be
right up there with the dodo bird.

941
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:11,894
Cut the feed.

942
01:04:13,296 --> 01:04:15,965
Boys and girls, we'll be right back.

943
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:19,167
I'm not happy about all this nonsense.

944
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:21,770
We're taping a show, didn't you notice?

945
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:23,138
Now, what exactly do you want?

946
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:24,506
The gems.

947
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:26,441
We know everything.

948
01:04:26,442 --> 01:04:27,609
Oh, do you, now?

949
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,078
I don't have time for this.

950
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:30,979
Rico, call the cops.

951
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,748
That won't be necessary.

952
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:38,687
Charlie, Louis and Jessie.

953
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:39,755
What a squad.

954
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:43,960
Next time you try and escape, I
suggest a car without a huge bug on top.

955
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:46,829
It took us three seconds
to find that baby in the lot.

956
01:04:46,843 --> 01:04:51,000
Officer, you have to give us a chance.
Just listen, please.

957
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,706
It is them!

958
01:04:58,707 --> 01:05:04,113
The one with the smiling forehead
and the one who carries a snake on his arm.

959
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:05,581
Oh, boy.

960
01:05:07,523 --> 01:05:09,818
They came into our village.

961
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:12,754
They stole our treasure
from the sacred cave.

962
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:15,591
The gems of our ancestors.

963
01:05:17,053 --> 01:05:19,160
What on earth is he talking about?

964
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:22,198
Is this true, boys?
I'm ashamed of you.

965
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:24,032
Let's go.
You're under arrest.

966
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:25,066
It was him.

967
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:26,768
He made us do it, honest.

968
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:28,437
Set up the whole deal.

969
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:37,879
Nobody move, or Jessie here
goes for a little swim with the crocs.

970
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,872
And if I ain't mistaken,
it's just about feeding time.

971
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,218
Don't do it, Ollie!

972
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:44,486
Think of the kids!

973
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,788
The kids?
I hate the kids.

974
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:50,898
Every last rotten one of them.
Screaming and crying all day long.

975
01:05:50,899 --> 01:05:52,361
Boo!

976
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:53,996
Shut up, you little brats.

977
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,064
And those stinking animals.

978
01:05:56,065 --> 01:06:00,368
If I never see another crocodile
again my whole life, it'll be too soon.

979
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:03,372
Now give me those jewels, Rico.

980
01:06:05,615 --> 01:06:08,344
I've worked too hard for this to lose it now.

981
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:13,048
I'll just make my way to the
helicopter, no one will get hurt.

982
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:15,517
And you'll never have to see me again.

983
01:06:15,518 --> 01:06:16,585
What do we do?

984
01:06:16,846 --> 01:06:17,953
What can we do?

985
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,624
Good answer.
Smart. Very smart.

986
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:16,979
Mommy!

987
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:19,815
Are you okay?

988
01:07:19,857 --> 01:07:20,949
I'm fine.

989
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:25,321
- Thanks to Jackie.
- Jackie, you are the greatest.

990
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:27,655
Looks like I owe you a big apology.

991
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:29,279
Although you have to admit,

992
01:07:29,303 --> 01:07:32,093
shipping yourselves
over in that crate was a little odd.

993
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:33,250
Not for us.

994
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,564
I'm just glad everything worked out.

995
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:44,439
You all have done a wonderful
thing, saving the gems of my people.

996
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,877
Now, if you don't mind, I'll just take
the gems of my people and keep them safe.

997
01:07:49,878 --> 01:07:52,741
You know, for the
long trip back to the tribe.

998
01:07:52,754 --> 01:07:55,617
Did I mention they were
the gems of my people?

999
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:56,785
Ronald.

1000
01:07:57,794 --> 01:08:00,956
Actually, officer, these
guys know the real owners.

1001
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:05,628
Well, Jackie, it's time to
get back home to Australia.

1002
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:14,303
Don't worry, boy, we'll take them too.

1003
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,440
Ow!

1004
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,875
Hey, look who it is.

1005
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:24,146
Just in time.
Looks like we're all going home.

1006
01:08:27,117 --> 01:08:29,385
This is a great day.

1007
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:33,255
You have returned the power to our tribe.

1008
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:35,623
We will flourish once again.

1009
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:37,592
Well, it's not like we had a choice.

1010
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:40,162
After all, we are the chosen ones.

1011
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:46,301
Not necessarily. You see,
we discovered a second painting.

1012
01:08:46,342 --> 01:08:50,305
As fate would have it,
you are not the chosen ones.

1013
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:51,205
We're not?

1014
01:08:51,206 --> 01:08:53,875
Actually, according to legend

1015
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:57,613
you were supposed to have been
eaten by dingoes last Thursday.

1016
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:02,584
- Not the chosen ones?
- Louis, don't you see what this means?

1017
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:05,319
You did all that stuff on your own.

1018
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,422
Jessie's right.

1019
01:09:06,603 --> 01:09:09,112
You don't have to be a
chosen one to do great things.

1020
01:09:09,137 --> 01:09:10,926
You just have to believe in yourself.

1021
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:15,730
How do you like that?
I'm a chosen one without being chosen.

1022
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:21,457
Charlie, Louis, Jessie.
We are forever indebted to you.

1023
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,004
I smell a reward.

1024
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:24,106
Shh!

1025
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:27,909
You will receive the greatest
gift my people possess.

1026
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,212
More valuable than our most precious jewels.

1027
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:33,047
I like the sound of that.

1028
01:09:33,048 --> 01:09:36,517
But first, I want you to have these.

1029
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:38,519
Pango pangos.

1030
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,123
The most fragrant berry in the world.

1031
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:45,861
Oh, for our new shampoo.
You remembered.

1032
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,228
Thank you.

1033
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:48,229
Yeah, that's great.

1034
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:51,366
Now, if you could just
skip on down to the big one.

1035
01:09:51,694 --> 01:09:52,735
Very well.

1036
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:02,910
We call upon the ancestors,
and upon the rainbow serpent.

1037
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:05,581
Awaken from the dreamtime.

1038
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:07,816
Give me your hands.

1039
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:11,767
Here.

1040
01:10:14,823 --> 01:10:19,341
From the great gods of
fire, water, sky and earth.

1041
01:10:19,366 --> 01:10:23,298
You are now one with nature.

1042
01:10:26,182 --> 01:10:29,371
- Excuse me?
- One with nature.

1043
01:10:30,286 --> 01:10:31,173
That's it?

1044
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:35,244
Trust me.
This is a beauty.

1045
01:10:41,464 --> 01:10:46,020
I said it before, I'll say it
again, that chief is a lunatic.

1046
01:10:46,021 --> 01:10:47,556
"One with nature.

1047
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:53,295
Hey, Jackie, bet it's good to
be home with the family, huh?

1048
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,431
You can say that again.

1049
01:10:56,893 --> 01:10:57,666
Jackie?

1050
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,434
You can talk?

1051
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:00,356
Naturally.

1052
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:03,305
I've been talking the whole time,
you just haven't been listening.

1053
01:11:03,339 --> 01:11:04,772
One with nature.

1054
01:11:04,773 --> 01:11:06,568
We're one with nature!

1055
01:11:06,608 --> 01:11:08,377
This is unbelievable.

1056
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:12,547
I tell you what's unbelievable. One
minute I'm taking a drink out of a pond,

1057
01:11:12,548 --> 01:11:15,417
the next thing I know,
I'm in Vegas with Elvis.

1058
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:20,521
Still, I guess if it wasn't for you, I'd be
in the belly of some crocodile right now.

1059
01:11:20,522 --> 01:11:22,183
Hey, that's what friends are for.

1060
01:11:22,184 --> 01:11:23,958
We are friends, aren't we?

1061
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:27,396
You got that right, mate.
Friends for life.

1062
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,031
And sorry about pecking your head, Charlie.

1063
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:34,469
It's just, I love that sound.
Rather like an empty coconut.

1064
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,337
Okay, good to know.

1065
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:40,474
It was bad enough being in that
cage, but what really cheesed me off,

1066
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:43,044
that bonehead calling me Eric.

1067
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:45,969
"Eric the echidna.
My name is Larry.

1068
01:11:45,993 --> 01:11:47,748
Boy, that is rough.

1069
01:11:47,749 --> 01:11:51,152
Let me ask you something:
Does this make me look scary?

1070
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:52,754
Or am I just kidding myself?

1071
01:12:05,348 --> 01:12:07,736
Oh, nice one.

1072
01:12:15,992 --> 01:12:19,402
Sorry, got ahold of some bad hay.

1073
01:12:19,426 --> 01:12:22,017
Yep, one with nature.

1074
01:12:29,524 --> 01:12:33,724
