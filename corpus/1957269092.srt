1
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,660
Darlene: A dream come true?

2
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:20,200
It looks good.

3
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,290
Director: What the ... Are you kidding me?

4
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:28,309
Get out! Get out!

5
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:33,664
Darlene: Just do what he says.

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,190
Ginger: Yeah, I know. How many
years have I been doing this?

7
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,519
Darlene: I know, but ...

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,690
Jeffrey.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,563
Jeff: It's the United
International Top Model Contest.

10
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:54,333
Darlene: This is Darlene.

11
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,100
Uh-huh.

12
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:04,410
O-oh, okay, thank you.

13
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:14,962
You're in! You're in the
Top Model Competition!

14
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,430
I'm so happy!

15
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:20,333
Director: Can we get
the model on set please!

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,794
Darlene: Go, go go!

17
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,349
You're in it too.

18
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:34,889
Director: Take your position
on the starting line.

19
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,208
Tilt your head up, breasts out. Smile.

20
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,493
Okay, you're running a race. Go.

21
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:51,140
Stop, stop! Look where you are.

22
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:55,894
Back at the starting line, and
this time, stay in your lane!

23
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:06,421
Head up, tuck your fanny in. Smile. Run!

24
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,361
Okay, and back to the top.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,779
Yay.

26
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:20,366
Bring the right shoulder up a bit more.

27
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,501
Now look sultry.

28
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,424
Ginger: Aren't you glad
we moved to the beach?

29
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:50,853
Darlene: You have your
trainer this afternoon.

30
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,693
Where are you going?

31
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,636
Ginger: To the gym.

32
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,913
Darlene: On the skates?

33
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:06,456
Ginger: Mhm.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,150
Darlene: You know if you
injure yourself you're going to

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,661
wreck your opportunity for
the Top Model competition.

36
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:15,034
Ginger: No.

37
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:23,648
Darlene: Darling, this is your big break.

38
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,595
I want you to do your best.

39
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:30,536
Ginger: I know, I will. I'll be careful.

40
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,816
I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself.

41
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,638
You've got to let me live, woman. Move.

42
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:39,310
Darlene: While I'm managing
you you'll do as I say.

43
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,372
Ginger: While I'm managing
you you'll do as I say.

44
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,139
Bye.

45
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,115
Man: legal, get high.

46
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:56,218
Ginger: Hi.

47
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,027
Madonna: I'm just about to start a show.

48
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,170
Ginger: Cool.

49
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,247
Madonna: Good morning.

50
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:01,872
Chaos: Hey, hello hello.

51
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,539
You need help with your plumbing?

52
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,314
Ginger: No.

53
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,468
You're in for a treat,
Madonna is one of the best.

54
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,970
Madonna: Oh, whatever.

55
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,586
Chaos: Oh, touchy. I guess I better

56
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,315
let you get on with it then.

57
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:18,890
My name's Chaos.

58
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,767
Ginger: Ginger.

59
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,207
Madonna: Ginger, if you
could just take a couple

60
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,585
steps back you can help me build a crowd.

61
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:27,706
Ginger: Over ...

62
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,616
Madonna: Yep, just take a
couple steps back right there.

63
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:31,820
Madonna: Hello everyone.

64
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,836
I'm Madonna, and I'm
about to start a show.

65
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,714
For the start I'm just going
to need two volunteers.

66
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,749
Only two, I know it's early
in our relationship to ask.

67
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:46,651
I'm going to need a man,
and a woman. Anyone?

68
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,896
You there, come over
here! Come on, come on!

69
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:54,300
Stand. Oh my!

70
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,887
Let's give a hand for our
first volunteer, shall we?

71
00:05:57,998 --> 00:06:00,604
Fabulous!

72
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,828
Let's see. And maybe we can get

73
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:06,178
a man with the lady.

74
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:10,642
Maybe a man- There you are!

75
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,540
Oh, he's fabulous.

76
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:15,317
Just for a minute, it
will be a lot of fun.

77
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:20,104
Ah, give it up for our second volunteer!

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,994
Come on, come on. Bravo.

79
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:27,402
I'm going to give you a little bit of

80
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:30,338
costume because obviously
this is not enough.

81
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:36,518
Here, and here.

82
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,149
Take this, now let's put this on.

83
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,577
Come on, give them a hand, help them out.

84
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,533
They're doing a great job!

85
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,938
He looks like he's never
put on a tutu before.

86
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,359
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

87
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,839
My ballerinas, they're fabulous.

88
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,630
Oh yes, don't they look wonderful?

89
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:08,950
Now can get get a little bit of a dance?

90
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,907
Just a spin, just a spin.

91
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:13,920
Come on, a little spin.

92
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:17,291
Very nice.

93
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:20,791
Do you two know each other,
do you know each other?

94
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,817
No? Have you ever met this
man before in your life?

95
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:26,872
I want you to give each other
a little high five, can we?

96
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:28,512
High five.

97
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,720
Yes, yes! Now a little handshake, maybe?

98
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,881
A little handshake? Come on.

99
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:40,200
Yes, fabulous, fabulous!

100
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,571
Maybe just a little
hug, just a little hug.

101
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:46,198
Woman: I don't think so.
Sorry, we're not doing that.

102
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,651
Sorry about that. I'm sorry.

103
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:53,383
Madonna: Oh no. Well that's not-

104
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:55,840
That's not going to work.

105
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,728
Thank you all so much for your time,

106
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,713
you've been a wonderful audience.

107
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,654
My name's Madonna, that's
my show for the day.

108
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:03,987
I want to start again when
we get a bit more people.

109
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,548
If you'd like to show your appreciation

110
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:09,227
you can drop a coin in the hat.

111
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:21,313
Oh, thank you.

112
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,719
Chaos: I just want to
say-

113
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,408
Hey sexy.

114
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:38,127
Madonna: Oh, hey. You still alive?

115
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:40,118
Just barely.

116
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,658
What's up brother?

117
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,243
Chaos: Crazy as usual.

118
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:49,806
Madonna: Oh, thank you.

119
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:57,257
I don't know what's going on with my show.

120
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:58,797
Chaos: Well you've got it on video

121
00:08:58,797 --> 00:08:59,867
so you can see what went wrong.

122
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,600
Madonna: I know what went wrong.

123
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,609
Chaos: All right, it's
not the end of the world.

124
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:07,910
It was just an unfortunate
choice of volunteer.

125
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,564
Not you, you were fine.

126
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:13,960
You made the right choice to bail.

127
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,712
I don't know, maybe.

128
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,820
I feel like you could
have rescued that one.

129
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,109
Madonna: Well sure, but
then I would have had

130
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,828
less audience and less money in the hat.

131
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,108
You don't know that.

132
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,241
But that's normally what happens

133
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,979
because you're stuck in your routine.

134
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:32,947
Madonna: Maybe you're right.

135
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,380
Of course I'm right.

136
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,254
Madonna: Next time I need
to take my time and play

137
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,912
with the audience more
before I pick a volunteer.

138
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,018
All right, who's up?

139
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:46,476
Chaos: It's me, I'm up. It's me.

140
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,250
Can I borrow your camera?

141
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,628
Madonna: Ooh, yeah.

142
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,369
Chaos: Yes, thank you.

143
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:37,733
Yes, this is a show, and I'm
going to be starting just

144
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:41,886
as soon as I finish setting
my stage and warm up.

145
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:22,285
Madonna: How are you? I
haven't seen you in a while.

146
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,681
I just did Paris for the first time.

147
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:26,969
Madonna: I know! How was it?

148
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,885
Are you kidding? It was
fantastic, it's awesome.

149
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:31,852
I've got my show really working out.

150
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:32,952
Madonna: Nice.

151
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:34,422
Ginger: That's really funny.

152
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,612
You guys are pretty lucky,

153
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:40,728
just traveling around
the world, having fun.

154
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:44,687
Madonna: Well you could too,
there's nothing stopping you.

155
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,990
Ginger: No, I could never do that.

156
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,473
Madonna: Why?

157
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,913
Ginger: I'm just not that kind of person.

158
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,395
Madonna: I wasn't that
kind of person either.

159
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,729
Ginger: I don't have a show.

160
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,216
Madonna: You just start, and
you learn as you go along.

161
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,642
Want to know the
secret of how to do it?

162
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,120
Just let it be easy.

163
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,969
Ginger: There has to be a
little more to it than that.

164
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:25,478
Nope. It's all about
surrendering to the flow,

165
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:30,440
and building up to a climax.

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,398
Madonna: He always uses the same line.

167
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:36,953
Ginger: Um. Thank you for the explanation.

168
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:39,527
But I don't think I'm any the wiser.

169
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,700
Madonna: We're always learning.

170
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,675
I mean, you saw my last show.

171
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:46,650
You can't wait until you
know everything to start.

172
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,738
Or you can take workshops.

173
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,963
Chaos does an evening class.

174
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,236
You don't need workshops.

175
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,348
Madonna: Keep it, it looks good on you.

176
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:34,158
Oh-hoh, fail.

177
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,538
Chaos: Here's your camera.

178
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:37,494
Madonna: Thank you.

179
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:41,319
Chaos: Thank you.
Madonna: No, thank you.

180
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,859
Chaos: Okay.

181
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,292
Madonna: I'm going to get some coffee.

182
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,566
Does anybody need anything?

183
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:51,700
Chaos: Oh, yes. Get me a water please.

184
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:56,876
Madonna: Thank you.

185
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:04,846
Ginger: That was great,
you were really funny.

186
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,882
Very inspiring.

187
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:10,548
She's a clown convert.

188
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,255
Chaos: That simple, is it?

189
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:21,137
I bet you think clowns all
about making people laugh.

190
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,137
Ginger: Yes.

191
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,933
Chaos: What's the
difference from comedy then?

192
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,550
Comedy's about being real, in the moment,

193
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,200
without all the pretenses we
normally defend ourselves with.

194
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,655
That guy, for example, the one that got

195
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:38,973
dragged out of Madonna's
show by his girlfriend?

196
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,367
They shared some intimate
information about themselves and

197
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:47,367
their relationship, which people
can relate to, so they laugh.

198
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:49,456
But that laughter is just footprints

199
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,874
in the sand, after, like spirits.

200
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,614
Ginger: You're deep.

201
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,920
Chaos: As a clown you don't
just learn about yourself,

202
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,290
you learn about all the
other people in the world.

203
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,759
And you know something?
They're all different.

204
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,360
Billions of them, all different,

205
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,562
all busy trying to tell
their story, if you listen.

206
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:22,360
Ginger: You don't think I'm listening?

207
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:25,332
Chaos: I don't even think
you're listening to yourself.

208
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,832
Ginger: TC said to just let it be easy.

209
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,531
You make me terrified of even trying it.

210
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,279
Chaos:.

211
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:40,427
Clown. Here you are,
being real in the moment.

212
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,661
Is that something you normally do?

213
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,119
Ginger: I try to.

214
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,427
Sometimes I do.

215
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:51,477
You know, most of the time.

216
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,483
You know what? You don't
even know anything about me.

217
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:08,463
Chaos: I'd say you still live at home.

218
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:11,100
Probably just your mother.
She's your overbearing side.

219
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,254
You work occasionally,
probably as a model.

220
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:16,692
You have in your room.

221
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:19,813
And you're desperately
seeking a real relationship.

222
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:23,317
Ginger: No.

223
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,840
Chaos: What part isn't true?

224
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,634
Ginger: I'm not desperately
seeking anything.

225
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,596
Chaos: Now that's the part I know is true.

226
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,484
Ginger: How?

227
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:36,524
Chaos: Because here you are,

228
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:40,730
having an intimate conversation
with a complete stranger.

229
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:47,338
Madonna: Hey, take it easy on her.

230
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:50,562
She's thinking about
taking your workshops.

231
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:55,193
Chaos: Oh, well that's a
complete different story.

232
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,173
In that case, you'd of course

233
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:04,152
be most welcome.

234
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,667
Darlene: Good, you're home.

235
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:45,886
How did it go?

236
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,260
Ginger: Very refreshing.

237
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,322
Darlene: You need to change,
we have that sponsorship party.

238
00:17:51,507 --> 00:17:53,342
Ginger: I have a class I want to go to.

239
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,687
Darlene: I'm sorry, we have to go.

240
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,901
Ginger: I hate those things.

241
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:05,779
Can't drink, I don't know
anyone, and they're always old.

242
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:08,141
Darlene: Well I need you.
You're the one they sponsor.

243
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:12,220
Ginger: It's not like I see
any of that money anyway.

244
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,965
Darlene: You know it goes into
a trust. You get an allowance.

245
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,865
Jeffrey will be by in a few minutes.

246
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,739
Ginger: Jeffrey. Why do you always

247
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:26,122
hire these young men assistants?

248
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,768
Darlene: I do it for you.

249
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:28,808
Ginger: For me?

250
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,259
Darlene: Mhm.

251
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,774
You find Jeffrey attractive don't you?

252
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:33,705
Ginger: Mom!

253
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:35,667
Darlene: Oh come on,
you've got to start dating.

254
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:37,236
We took a vow of chastity but it doesn't

255
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,218
mean we can't go out and have any fun.

256
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,902
Ginger: Oh my God.

257
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,475
Chaos: Okay no hands, no hands.

258
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,717
You're late, and a little overdressed.

259
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:16,742
Ginger: Oh, yeah.

260
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:19,327
I had to go to one of my
sponsor's parties, sorry.

261
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:22,800
Chaos: Well, it's a hard
life for some of us.

262
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,967
Ginger: Actually very boring.

263
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,773
Chaos: Do you have anything
else you can change into?

264
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,411
Ginger: Yeah.

265
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,895
Chaos: Okay.

266
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:36,018
Um, Clara.

267
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:51,918
Clara that was very good.

268
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:58,807
Class this is Ginger. Ginger, class.

269
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:02,862
I'm not going to lie, since
you came in late you're

270
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:05,462
going to kind of have to
jump into the unknown.

271
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,379
Your structure is move abnormally,

272
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:14,164
and touch the object on
stage with your body.

273
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,830
And you don't know what it is.

274
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,871
Ginger: It's a head of lettuce.

275
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,373
Chaos: No, you don't know what it is.

276
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,450
Ginger: I'm sorry, I have no
idea what you want me to do.

277
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,592
Chaos: Perfect, up you go.

278
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:30,677
Ginger: No, I don't know what I'm doing.

279
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:32,152
Chaos: So go find out.

280
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,797
Trust it will happen.

281
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:53,719
Move in abnormal movements.

282
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:58,745
Let us know how you feel by using sounds.

283
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:07,680
Ginger: Ugh!

284
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:32,745
Chaos: No hands.

285
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,683
Ladies and gentleman, a big
round of applause for her.

286
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,219
That was really good. Thank you.

287
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:00,193
Thank you.

288
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,385
Welcome back.

289
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,541
Ginger: I feel really good now.

290
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:07,886
Chaos: That's good.

291
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,229
Woman: Hey, you had
some really lovely work.

292
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,716
I mean, you're thinking too much but once

293
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:14,810
you got off there you're a joy to watch.

294
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,957
Ginger: Thanks, I think.

295
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:19,641
You know, I really actually
thought I knew what a clown was.

296
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,455
No idea, none.

297
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:25,243
Chaos: Excellent. You are now on your way.

298
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,098
Woman: See you next week.
Chaos: Take care.

299
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,695
Do you want to walk with
me along the ocean walk?

300
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:38,458
Dancer: Hey.

301
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,223
Chaos: Honey.

302
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:49,100
Honey this is Ginger, a new clown student.

303
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:51,951
Ginger: Nice to meet you.
Honey is a very nice name.

304
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:54,300
Dancer: My name's Dancer.

305
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,312
Only Chaos calls me Honey.

306
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:00,515
Chaos: We were just about
to explore the ocean walk.

307
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:04,436
Dancer: Anything for a
new clown student, right?

308
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,660
Especially a young, pretty female one.

309
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,854
Chaos: We'll just walk that
way back to your house.

310
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,143
Dancer: This will be fun.

311
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,419
Let's take you out to play.

312
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,670
Ginger: That was fun.

313
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,478
Chaos: Yeah, you were good, see?

314
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:28,260
You just need to let it go.

315
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:32,890
Look at this guy and his funny walk.

316
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,763
Ginger: You don't watch people normally.

317
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:54,403
Chaos: No, you don't
watch people normally.

318
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:55,947
Ginger: That's what I meant.

319
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,185
Chaos: I know.

320
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:07,921
Dancer: Lovely evening. Love your shirt.

321
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:08,920
Watch, he's going to
turn back and look at us.

322
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,346
Let's all wave.

323
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:22,410
Let's play the hello
game, it's nice and simple.

324
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:25,192
Chaos: We don't need to
play, we can just watch.

325
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:26,688
Dancer: But the clown
student wants to play.

326
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,416
That's why she's here, isn't it?

327
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,723
Ginger: I've had a big day already.

328
00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:33,102
Dancer: That's the best time to
do it, when you're on a roll.

329
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:34,468
Chaos: She likes to
pretend that she's a tea-

330
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:35,816
Dancer: I've seen you do it.

331
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:36,740
Chaos: Exactly.

332
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,480
Dancer: The hello game
is all about attracting

333
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,577
attention and making contact with people.

334
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,253
Watch.

335
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:56,100
Hello ladies, hello! Oh-la-la-la-la.

336
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,827
See? It's as simple as that.

337
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,518
You have a go.

338
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:20,412
Try this family.

339
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,882
Chaos: You're doing it
wrong, she needs a nose.

340
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:27,378
Dancer: That's right.

341
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,503
Ginger: Hey!

342
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:41,930
Man: Hey.

343
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:45,793
Dancer: Well done.

344
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:48,502
You try that guy.

345
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:50,269
Ginger: Wait, which one?
Dancer: That guy.

346
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,128
Chaos: You okay?

347
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,778
That's why she's not a
teacher, she's a trickster.

348
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,903
You can learn a lot from
her if remember that.

349
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:17,680
Dancer: Come on, that was funny.

350
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:33,167
Chaos: I guess you've
had enough for today,

351
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,952
but it's best not to end that way.

352
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,833
You up for something else?

353
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:40,264
Let's try some mimicry.

354
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:43,557
Try him.

355
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,940
Ginger: I can't, it's rude.

356
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,513
Chaos: Why?

357
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,809
Ginger: We don't have permission.

358
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,807
Chaos: I give you permission.

359
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,512
Ginger: That's very nice, but he didn't.

360
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:03,168
Chaos: He'll never know,
he doesn't need to.

361
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:03,945
Dancer: You have to give yourself

362
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:06,521
permission, that's the secret.

363
00:27:07,657 --> 00:27:09,676
Ginger: Just give myself permission.

364
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,543
Chaos: She's right. He'll never know.

365
00:27:12,772 --> 00:27:14,821
It's just your own inhibitions.

366
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,691
Ginger: Great, it's just my inhibitions.

367
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,110
Chaos: Yes. Off you go.

368
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:49,530
Ginger: All right.
Chaos: That was awesome.

369
00:27:55,362 --> 00:27:56,848
Dancer: Nice job.

370
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,411
Chaos: You want to try some
play like we did in class?

371
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,868
You see that tree?

372
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,904
That's your head of
lettuce. Go play with it.

373
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:09,989
Ginger: You want me to bury
myself with a palm tree?

374
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,905
Sorry.

375
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,493
You know, I'm good. I've
had enough, it's good.

376
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,269
Chaos: Okay, what if I do it with you.

377
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,807
Will that make it easier?

378
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,699
Ginger: Yeah.

379
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:31,321
Chaos: Can you take a video
so she can see it later?

380
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,564
Dancer: Give me your phone.

381
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,502
Ginger: Eh, down.

382
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:23,527
Oh my God!

383
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,814
Hey!

384
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:48,162
I didn't even realize
we had people watching.

385
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,256
Darlene: Well you look like
a couple of crazy people,

386
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:51,989
of course they're going to watch.

387
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,568
Ginger: You know, you have no idea

388
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,999
what a wonderful day I had yesterday.

389
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,764
Darlene: Were you on drugs?

390
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,326
Ginger: No, mom.

391
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:04,990
Darlene: Well I was at my
wit's end. I left you messages.

392
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,339
Ginger: My phone was off.

393
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,322
You're hovering, give me some space.

394
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:22,690
Darlene: I booked you a
lingerie shoot for tomorrow.

395
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:26,385
Ginger: I told you
I don't want to do those.

396
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:29,987
Darlene: I know, but as soon as you make

397
00:30:29,987 --> 00:30:32,479
the Top Model competition
you won't have to.

398
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,781
Ginger: I think I want to be a clown.

399
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,437
Darlene: Well, that's
just not appropriate.

400
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:42,120
Think of my reputation.

401
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:43,453
Ginger: I bet you think clown is all

402
00:30:43,453 --> 00:30:45,684
about making people laugh, don't you?

403
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:49,167
Darlene: It obviously doesn't
matter what I think, does it?

404
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:54,877
Ginger: Whatever.

405
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,215
Darlene: You have a
casting this afternoon.

406
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,697
It's with that new designer, he's good.

407
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:09,107
Ginger: Can't they just
do it from the photos?

408
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:10,527
Darlene: Oh no, no, no, no.

409
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,383
No, it's a fashion show.

410
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:16,158
Come on, you- you've got
to show how you move.

411
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,583
Ginger: That was really
good. Maybe you should do it.

412
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,696
Darlene: Maybe I should.

413
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:28,373
Ginger: Maybe you should.

414
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:35,560
Madonna: All right,.

415
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:39,141
Here we go, I could just
stay here all day, why not.

416
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:41,145
Good, that's perfect, I love it.

417
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:47,979
I bet you had no idea
you were going to get-

418
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:53,238
Taste it, taste it, oh my goodness!

419
00:31:54,284 --> 00:31:59,284
And for the final act,
magical juggling madness.

420
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,294
Before you very eyes, as promised.

421
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,810
Yes!

422
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,386
That's it, thank you everyone.

423
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:06,985
Can you bend your knees?

424
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,509
That's your show today,
ladies and gentlemen.

425
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,390
If you appreciated it
at all you can show your

426
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,371
consideration by dropping
a dollar in the hat.

427
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,404
Thank you so much, green for green.

428
00:32:16,404 --> 00:32:17,459
Ginger: Hey.

429
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:20,433
Chaos: Hey.

430
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,722
Ginger: Hey, thanks again for yesterday.

431
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:33,175
When I showed the video to
my mom she was horrified.

432
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:34,589
Chaos: Let's have a look.

433
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,767
Ginger: Hey, how was that?

434
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:48,237
Madonna: I am stuck in a time warp.

435
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:50,630
Ginger: Looked like a lot
of your crowd walked away.

436
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:53,575
Madonna: I'm running on
autopilot and they can feel it.

437
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,868
Ginger: Well, I can't feel it.

438
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,627
Madonna: Well I'm just a
washed up street clown,

439
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,207
so what do I know?

440
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,840
What are you guys doing?

441
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,603
Chaos: Watching this improv that
Ginger and I did last night.

442
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,721
Madonna: Oh, well done.

443
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,235
I told you.

444
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,717
Ginger: Well I couldn't
have done it without Chaos.

445
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,981
Chaos: It's true.

446
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,604
I had to tell her to do it,
or do it with her, every time.

447
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,573
Madonna: Well that will
be your next challenge,

448
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,648
to do it on your own.

449
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:30,821
Ginger: On my own?

450
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:34,202
Chaos: Well you don't have to.

451
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:35,281
Madonna: We'll help you.

452
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,498
All you need is a simple structure.

453
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:42,935
Big night last night?

454
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,832
Chaos: Yeah, Dancer and
I did a lot of talking.

455
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,873
Ginger: Yeah, where is she?

456
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:49,998
Chaos: She makes more money at other gigs

457
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:52,130
so she only comes here when she has to.

458
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:55,100
Ginger: She seems ...

459
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,851
Madonna: Uptight? Competitive? Jealous?

460
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:01,467
Possessive in a kind of
non-possesive possesive kind of way?

461
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:06,745
Chaos: Dancer and I have
an open relationship.

462
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,726
Madonna: How is that going for you?

463
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,410
Chaos: I know it's mainly so she

464
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,829
can sleep around when she's touring.

465
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,320
And now she's getting suspicious

466
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,381
of the students when she's here.

467
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:17,708
Ginger: Why? Do you normally have

468
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,714
relationships with students?

469
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:21,677
Chaos: Never.

470
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,330
Ginger: Never?

471
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:26,700
Chaos: That's not what we're doing here.

472
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,928
Ginger: No, I- Of course,
that's not what I meant.

473
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:36,434
Besides, you have that wonderful
relationship with Dancer.

474
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,616
Chaos: Okay, now that we
all know about my love life.

475
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:44,145
What about yours?

476
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,223
Ginger: Well in my family we ...

477
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,249
believe in abstinence until marriage.

478
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,754
Madonna: Hey.

479
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:03,359
Hey.

480
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:05,304
Who's working?

481
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,942
Chaos: It's me.

482
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:18,650
Madonna: I think the
first thing we should do,

483
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,528
take you shopping for
some performance clothes.

484
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,239
Ginger: Okay, can you mind my stuff?

485
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,888
Madonna: Come on.

486
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,338
Ginger: Ew, dusty.

487
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:32,842
Madonna: Yes, of course they are.

488
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:37,882
Try these on.

489
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:48,123
Mhm.

490
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:49,753
This.

491
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,268
Hi!

492
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,727
Ginger: Hey!

493
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:09,217
Madonna: Howdy! Howdy ma'am.

494
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,016
What do you think?

495
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,973
Ginger: Oh, I love it, but I have

496
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:15,276
to say it's a little uncomfortable.

497
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,149
Madonna:
Let's find something else.

498
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,844
What do you think?

499
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:27,535
Ginger: It kind of feels like me.

500
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:31,806
I don't know, do you
think it's too obvious?

501
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,504
Madonna: No, that's
good, that's the point.

502
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,605
You can even do your
rollerblading in your show.

503
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:41,395
You don't have to wear
it, it's just so you

504
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:43,898
can collect money at the end of your show.

505
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:47,551
What are we going to do with this?

506
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,573
Ginger: Why, what's wrong with it?

507
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:54,972
Madonna: It's just a little normal.

508
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,745
Ginger: Well, I have my regular

509
00:36:57,745 --> 00:37:00,289
appointment with my stylist tomorrow.

510
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,587
Madonna: Think about it.

511
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,987
Ginger: I like it.

512
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:18,440
Madonna: Hey, shouldn't buy one of these?

513
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,856
Ginger: I have never tried.

514
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:22,908
Madonna: It will be a lot better than your

515
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,872
rollerblades because
you can hop on and off.

516
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,226
Ginger: This one kind
of matches my clothes.

517
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:42,789
Madonna: Oh, yeah!

518
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:44,289
Ginger: Oh yeah.

519
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:49,500
Hi papi. Okay, okay, okay!

520
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:59,315
Chaos: I see you've been
doing a clown makeover.

521
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:01,452
Madonna: She came up good, huh?

522
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:03,900
Chaos: You know any tricks on that?

523
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:05,598
I can teach you.

524
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,256
Ginger: Thanks.

525
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:12,701
What am I going to do for
the rest of it though?

526
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,858
I mean, the skateboarding is
just the last couple of minutes.

527
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,890
What do I do for the rest of the show?

528
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,575
Chaos: Well, start with what you like.

529
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,803
What did you like most about yesterday?

530
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:29,884
Ginger: Teasing the men?

531
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:33,110
Chaos: Teasing the men. Teasing the men.

532
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,970
Ginger: Well like, I
remember this one guy,

533
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,168
and he didn't even see me
until he bumped into me.

534
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:43,796
He turned around and apologized,
but he had on this tight

535
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:48,796
t-shirt and his nipples poked
out, so I kind of tweaked them.

536
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:52,251
I don't know why!

537
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:56,159
It seemed appropriate at the time.

538
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:58,470
Madonna: What did he do?

539
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,650
Ginger: He just laughed.

540
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,575
Chaos: That's a good
approach for your show.

541
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:06,698
Take the men on stage,
then push the boundaries.

542
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,461
Madonna: And the rest is straight
street theater structure.

543
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,218
First you attract attention.

544
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:16,911
Chaos: Then build the audience.

545
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:19,600
Madonna: Then you make friends,

546
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,801
because you're going to need them.

547
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,470
Chaos: Organize your audience, and then

548
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,381
start playing some crowd-building games.

549
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:28,864
Madonna: Then you introduce
yourself and start your show.

550
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,311
Chaos: Drag your volunteers on

551
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:33,963
stage and, play with their nipples.

552
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:39,831
Pass the hat around.

553
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:44,250
Madonna: Nice.

554
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:49,373
Ginger: But how am I going to do all that?

555
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:53,218
Okay, okay, okay. Give me the list again?

556
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,389
Madonna: First attract an audience ...

557
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:00,837
Ginger: What if I can't do it?

558
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:01,873
Chaos: No, you can do it.

559
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:04,293
I mean, you know how to skate
so you'll pick it up quickly.

560
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,155
Ginger: Show me how.

561
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,417
Chaos: Okay.

562
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:09,783
Ginger: Just do it.

563
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,149
Pretty good.

564
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,447
Chaos: I'm just playing. You have a go.

565
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:30,818
Ginger: So put my foot, like right here?

566
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:32,640
Chaos: Yes.

567
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,621
Ginger: Okay, then?

568
00:40:33,621 --> 00:40:35,976
Chaos: Keep that there and then push.

569
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:38,350
Ginger: Woo!

570
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,530
Chaos: Turn.

571
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:41,152
Ginger: Turn where?

572
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:42,100
Chaos: Your feet.

573
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,629
Ginger: No, no, no, no.

574
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,173
Chaos: Again!

575
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:54,970
Ginger:
how do you stop this thing?

576
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:56,368
Chaos: I haven't figured that out-

577
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:57,871
I'm playing, I'm playing.

578
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:01,367
Ginger: I hate you.

579
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,957
Chaos: If I jump that box, how
about you do the show with me?

580
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:07,432
Ginger: That's a deal.

581
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:10,141
Chaos: Deal.

582
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:11,703
Ginger: That box right there?

583
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,227
Chaos: That box right there.

584
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,779
Ginger: Any day now.

585
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,188
Chaos: Clown down.

586
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:29,589
Ginger: Give me that.

587
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:33,494
I have to go. I'm late for a fitting.

588
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,397
Chaos: Oh no you don't.

589
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,998
You don't get out of
doing a show that easy.

590
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:38,960
Ginger: No, I really have to go.

591
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,586
Chaos: Uh-uh.
Ginger: Give me that!

592
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:43,951
I'll be right back. I'll
be right- I promise.

593
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:45,275
Chaos: Okay.

594
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:02,422
Ginger: Hi.

595
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:03,725
Woman: Thank you for coming in.

596
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:09,229
Jamie, this is Ginger.

597
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,330
Ginger: Sorry about the clothes,
I was at a costume event.

598
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:28,448
Jamie: Do we have her measurements?

599
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:29,650
Woman: Mhm.

600
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,772
Oh, we'll let you know.

601
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,275
So Veronica, somewhere
in the middle, right?

602
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:56,476
Jamie: Might be somewhere in the middle.

603
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:59,479
We can't close with Veronica.
She has a horse face.

604
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:02,182
Madonna: I left the amp on for you

605
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:04,885
so you can plug in your music.

606
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:13,994
Ginger: Maybe I can't-

607
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:16,496
Maybe I'm not ready to do this today.

608
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:20,500
Madonna: You're never really
ready, it's a work in progress.

609
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,104
At least after you do it
you'll have learned something.

610
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:25,406
Ginger: Yeah, that I can't do it.

611
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,907
Madonna: Well, if you think like that,

612
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,593
that's exactly what you're going to get.

613
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:32,120
Ginger: You think your show's
a problem all the time.

614
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,714
Madonna: Because it is.

615
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,516
Chaos: You know, she's right.

616
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:37,217
Maybe if you thought about it differently,

617
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:38,519
your show would work out.

618
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,166
Madonna: Well I'm just a
washed-up street clown,

619
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,722
what do I know?

620
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:44,825
Chaos: You see how you're
always putting yourself down?

621
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,626
Madonna: It's a joke!

622
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,129
Chaos: Yeah, that's in
danger of becoming true.

623
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:49,930
Madonna: All right! Okay!

624
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:22,687
Ginger: Hi!

625
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:23,863
Man: Hey.

626
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:13,514
Ginger: Hello, how are you?

627
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:34,340
Hi guy, how are you?

628
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,639
Woo!

629
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:39,939
Hello.

630
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:44,344
I like you guys.

631
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,846
Oh sir, are you okay?

632
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:49,149
Bye!

633
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,151
Do you guys want to see a trick?

634
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,253
Come stand right here.

635
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:55,560
Do you want to hold my?

636
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:57,758
Wait one second.

637
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,669
Chaos: Oh my God, are you okay?

638
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,700
Ginger: I have a shoot tomorrow.

639
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,573
Chaos: Good thing you're
wearing those kneepads.

640
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:12,573
Ginger: You have no idea how many

641
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:13,975
problems this is going to cause.

642
00:46:13,975 --> 00:46:16,877
Chaos: It'll heal quickly, it's okay.

643
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:18,479
Ginger: I told you I wasn't ready.

644
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:20,810
Chaos: Yeah, and you proved it.

645
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:23,885
Ginger: Thanks a lot.

646
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,306
Darlene: Ginger? Good.

647
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,609
Can you help me with
these groceries please?

648
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,813
What are you wearing?

649
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:55,115
Ginger: The clowns gave me a makeover.

650
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:58,180
Darlene: I told you I didn't
want you hanging out with them.

651
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,320
Ginger: Don't worry, it's
not going to happen again.

652
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:12,733
Um, I'm sorry, I fell and
bruised my leg yesterday

653
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:15,735
so maybe this isn't the best day for this.

654
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:17,338
Man: Show me.

655
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,944
Show me.

656
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:42,464
What have you done with your leg?

657
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,865
Ginger: I told you I fell.

658
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,877
Man: Well that's not going to work, is it.

659
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,679
Shame.

660
00:48:01,134 --> 00:48:02,683
Is your mother here?

661
00:48:06,472 --> 00:48:08,013
Darlene: You know what, you don't know

662
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,689
how lucky you are to have her.

663
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,910
This is the last time we do one

664
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,793
of these, especially with you.

665
00:48:16,197 --> 00:48:18,990
See how I stick up for you?

666
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,500
Ginger: You're supposed to.

667
00:48:21,903 --> 00:48:23,603
But, thank you.

668
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,800
Darlene: What's the story?

669
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,913
Oh my God.

670
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:37,217
Why didn't you tell me?

671
00:48:37,618 --> 00:48:39,119
Ginger: I thought it would heal.

672
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,523
Darlene: Geeze, what happened?

673
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:44,424
Ginger: I fell.

674
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:50,331
Darlene: Oh you stupid
girl, you stupid girl!

675
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:53,833
You promised me you would
protect yourself, you promised!

676
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:57,438
You know what, we are just going to

677
00:48:57,438 --> 00:48:59,639
go right now and get your hair done.

678
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:03,143
Ginger: Stop treating me like a child.

679
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:05,545
Darlene: Stop acting like one.

680
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:07,948
Stylist: So, same as usual?

681
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,949
Wash, trim and straighten?

682
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:13,454
Ginger: Actually I thought I would do

683
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:16,256
something a little more drastic this time.

684
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:19,875
Maybe something like this.

685
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:27,670
Stylist: I don't think your
mother would like that.

686
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,469
Ginger: Yeah, I know.

687
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:32,872
But it's my hair.

688
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:49,389
Madonna: Hey, nice hair!

689
00:49:50,312 --> 00:49:52,169
How is our little clown today?

690
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:53,417
Ginger: I'm fine.

691
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:58,720
All right, I can't do it. Is
that what you want to hear?

692
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,276
Madonna: Hey, that's not true.

693
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:01,902
You had some really great moments.

694
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,204
Ginger: When?

695
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:04,705
Madonna: The lying on the ground,

696
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,806
and stopping people with the whistle.

697
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,209
That was good.

698
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:10,411
Dancer: You just got
confused with your structure.

699
00:50:10,411 --> 00:50:13,113
It happens to everyone.
I mean, look at Chaos.

700
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:16,117
Ginger: Yeah, what's he doing?

701
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,180
Dancer: He's dying out there.

702
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,240
Ginger: Why isn't it working?

703
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:26,326
Dancer: He's just, not so good.

704
00:50:26,728 --> 00:50:29,230
Ginger: But he is, he's great. He's ...

705
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,735
so original and creative.

706
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:38,735
Dancer: Aww, the clown
student loves her teacher.

707
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:41,442
Madonna: It happens to everyone.

708
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:42,943
Dancer: Him, more than most.

709
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:44,244
Madonna: I don't know about that.

710
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:45,845
Dancer: Invariably when I'm here.

711
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,455
Chaos: Woo.

712
00:50:55,856 --> 00:50:57,557
Dancer: Well, the only good thing we can

713
00:50:57,557 --> 00:51:00,461
say about that is you bailed early.

714
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,710
You want to meet me tomorrow afternoon?

715
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,873
I've got a proposal.

716
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,676
Chaos: Okay.

717
00:51:28,644 --> 00:51:31,992
My stuff never works when
she's around. She's a jinx.

718
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:34,995
Madonna: It's emotional.

719
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:40,901
You try way too hard when she's around.

720
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:43,204
You play it safe rather than
push any of your boundaries.

721
00:51:43,204 --> 00:51:44,505
Chaos: Oh, and you can talk?

722
00:51:44,906 --> 00:51:47,407
Madonna: I'm just saying, just saying.

723
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:55,616
Chaos: Great hair.

724
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:00,922
Ginger: Sorry, it's
just ... trying to work

725
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:03,624
out what to do in my show so I don't fail.

726
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:06,260
Madonna: Hey, failure is good.

727
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:08,829
We learn so much more from our

728
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:11,231
failures than we do our successes.

729
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:14,340
Chaos: And we often tell others
what we need to do ourselves.

730
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,360
Madonna: You.

731
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,839
Chaos: The secret is,
don't be afraid of failure,

732
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:20,440
just push your own boundaries.

733
00:52:21,842 --> 00:52:23,744
Ginger: I feel like I did that though.

734
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:28,033
Chaos: Well as you can
see, we need to keep at it.

735
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:34,830
Look at her.

736
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,257
She always does this,
she likes to show me up.

737
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,822
Ginger: Oh my God, that's so aggressive.

738
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:55,977
Chaos: It's just water.

739
00:52:55,977 --> 00:52:57,178
Ginger: Yeah but it's-

740
00:52:57,178 --> 00:52:59,580
It's an invasion of our personal space.

741
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:03,830
Chaos: That sounds like a
good definition of a clown.

742
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:08,188
Woman: He's shooting water at me!

743
00:53:10,012 --> 00:53:11,692
Chaos:.

744
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,414
Ginger: Sorry.

745
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:35,916
Darlene: Gosh, you scared me.

746
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:39,820
Ginger: Mama, how much
have you had to drink?

747
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:42,523
Darlene: Don't tell me what to do.

748
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:47,728
What are you wearing on your-

749
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:50,300
What are you wearing
on your head?

750
00:53:52,534 --> 00:53:54,534
Ginger: It's my new hat.

751
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,038
You like it?

752
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,838
Darlene: No.

753
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,741
Ginger: Okay.

754
00:54:03,048 --> 00:54:05,450
You have a good night.

755
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:10,950
Darlene: Night.

756
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:17,357
Ginger: All the top models are doing it.

757
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,663
Darlene: They booked you
for that job, by the way.

758
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:30,771
Ginger: I wanted to stand
out in the Top Model heat.

759
00:54:33,374 --> 00:54:35,576
Darlene: There's a fitting today at 2:00.

760
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:39,790
Ginger: Uh, okay. I was going to

761
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,810
go to the gym but I'll be there.

762
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,885
Darlene: I have to go. I love you.

763
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:57,998
Chaos: That is a lovely melon you have.

764
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:32,320
Now the moment you've
all been waiting for.

765
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:35,536
Come in closer, a little closer.

766
00:55:36,236 --> 00:55:38,739
Give me your energy, I feel it. Yes sir.

767
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:43,744
I need a big countdown from 10

768
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:50,350
nine, eight, seven,

769
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,780
six, five, four, three, two, one.

770
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:02,793
Woo-hoo!

771
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,572
You've all been a wonderful crowd.

772
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:14,175
Right before your very
eyes, a modern day clown.

773
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,877
Now is the time when I must take

774
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:19,180
the most important part of my show.

775
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,840
If work here is has caused
you ,

776
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,685
which judging by the clapping and

777
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:26,987
the wonderful countdown, it has.

778
00:56:27,894 --> 00:56:29,889
Now is the time to give back.

779
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:32,993
Oh, we're not smiling anymore.

780
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,597
Remember, the more you
give the more fun I have.

781
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:40,500
You've been beautiful and a great crowd.

782
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,504
My name is Chaos. This is my heart.

783
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:47,607
And this ... is my hat.

784
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:09,330
Ginger: That was great.
You just kept pushing it.

785
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:14,336
Chaos: Madonna's right,
that's my strength.

786
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:15,837
Ginger: Do you need help?

787
00:57:15,837 --> 00:57:17,370
Chaos: Yeah.

788
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,541
Madonna: Nice work!

789
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:26,346
Hey lady.

790
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,150
Ginger: All right guys,
how far can you go?

791
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,852
Chaos: As far as you want.

792
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,554
Madonna: You have to
really want to go there.

793
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:34,454
Chaos: Yeah, you can't be thinking

794
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:35,855
about it as you're doing it.

795
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:37,857
Ginger: I am always doing that.

796
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,460
Chaos: With clown or with life?

797
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:43,964
Ginger: Both.

798
00:57:45,365 --> 00:57:49,669
But I'm starting to see
you can pretty much do

799
00:57:49,669 --> 00:57:52,274
anything if you just
completely commit to it.

800
00:57:55,174 --> 00:57:57,277
Madonna: You know, I think you should push

801
00:57:57,277 --> 00:57:59,579
the envelope with your show a bit more.

802
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:03,183
Be a little more vulgar.

803
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:06,987
Absolutely.

804
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,488
Ginger: Go away.

805
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:13,395
Madonna: Breaking taboos is
all about releasing tension.

806
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,596
Taboos about playing with food.

807
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,700
Taboos about sex.

808
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,504
Watch this.

809
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,508
Come to momma, come to momma!

810
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:36,516
Give it a try!

811
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:38,190
Ginger: No, not him!

812
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:40,821
Madonna: With Chaos then.

813
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:44,424
Come on!

814
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:52,320
Ginger: Okay.

815
00:59:12,895 --> 00:59:14,854
Madonna: Oh, look at him.

816
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:17,558
Look at him.

817
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,661
Ginger: Don't get any ideas from that.

818
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,863
Chaos: Of course not.

819
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,870
Shall I give you some games to play?

820
00:59:32,587 --> 00:59:34,275
Put your nose on.

821
00:59:38,994 --> 00:59:40,780
See all this litter on the street?

822
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:44,784
I want you to pick it up
and give it to people.

823
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:46,870
Ginger: I'm not going to give
it to people, it's dirty.

824
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,290
Chaos: Oh! I'm trying to help you here

825
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,590
and you keep working against me.

826
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,991
Ginger: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

827
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,392
Chaos: Stop apologizing.

828
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:55,795
Now when I tell you to pick up
litter and give it to people,

829
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,990
and you feel something, don't
stop and talk to me about it.

830
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,400
Ginger: But-
Chaos: Let your feelings work

831
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,406
for you by expressing them in character.

832
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:14,916
I couldn't make a mess!

833
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:23,524
Ginger: I don't want to make a mess!

834
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:25,526
Chaos: Yes.

835
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:27,627
Now say it as you give it away.

836
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,334
Ginger: I don't want to make a mess.

837
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:35,350
I don't want to make a mess.

838
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,439
I don't want- I don't-

839
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:42,342
Oh. I don't want to make a mess.

840
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:44,440
Man: We're okay, thank you.

841
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,946
Ginger: I don't want to make a mess. Oh.

842
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:49,749
I don't want to make a mess. Ew.

843
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,481
I don't want to make a mess.

844
01:00:52,174 --> 01:00:53,592
Man: Thank you.

845
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:55,156
Ginger: I don't want to make a mess.

846
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:56,456
Woman: No thank you.

847
01:00:56,757 --> 01:00:59,590
Okay, I'll take it. Thank you.

848
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:06,266
Ginger: I don't want to make a mess.

849
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:10,370
Dancer: I see you brought your new puppet.

850
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,443
Chaos: She's doing good,
in a kind of bumbly way.

851
01:01:13,443 --> 01:01:15,275
Dancer: Why do you have
your microphone on?

852
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:18,780
Chaos: I just finished doing a show.

853
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,326
Dancer: Sure.

854
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:30,492
I think we need to get serious
about our relationship.

855
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,395
I've been offered a part in
the new Ringling Brothers show.

856
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:37,970
It's part of a duo.

857
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,502
They asked me who I want to work with

858
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:43,503
and I'm thinking of suggesting you.

859
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,800
Chaos: Wow.

860
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:52,212
Dancer: Wow?

861
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:55,216
Ginger: Oh my God, that was so much fun.

862
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:57,718
Give me another one.

863
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:01,210
Chaos: I've noticed you're
inhibited about using your voice.

864
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:05,225
So I want you to ask the
people what time it is

865
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:09,130
in a funny voice.

866
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:13,741
Ginger: But
I would never do that.

867
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:15,988
Chaos: Of course not.

868
01:02:15,988 --> 01:02:17,337
Off you go.

869
01:02:21,827 --> 01:02:23,443
Dancer: You really care about her.

870
01:02:23,644 --> 01:02:25,778
Chaos: I like to see
all my students growing.

871
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:28,248
Dancer: You really care about her.

872
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:37,458
Look, think about the
Ringling Brothers thing.

873
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,762
And if we do it I think we need to

874
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:43,763
formalize our relationship.

875
01:02:46,366 --> 01:02:47,768
Just think about it.

876
01:02:57,385 --> 01:02:58,979
Ginger: Do you have-a the time?

877
01:02:58,979 --> 01:02:59,680
Man: What time?

878
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,782
Ginger: The time, you know,
the time on the watch.

879
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:04,840
The thing. Oh yeah.

880
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:09,389
You are a very good man.
I love your sweater.

881
01:03:12,593 --> 01:03:14,156
Chaos: I think the next step is to do

882
01:03:14,156 --> 01:03:15,495
a guest spot on my show.

883
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:18,298
Ginger: A guest spot.

884
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:20,800
Chaos: Yeah, so you don't have
to do all the crowd building.

885
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,403
Ginger: Okay.

886
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,205
Chaos: Now.

887
01:03:26,506 --> 01:03:29,900
Ginger: I have a fitting in an hour.

888
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:33,313
But it should only take
half an hour or so?

889
01:03:35,216 --> 01:03:36,617
Chaos: Deal.

890
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:43,425
Ginger: Okay, okay. I'll be back.

891
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,342
Jamie: My God, your hair.

892
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:09,549
It wasn't like that the other day was it?

893
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:20,860
I actually like it.

894
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:24,464
But whether it will work for
this showing we'll have to see.

895
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:28,669
Get going, I need you
to start with Ginger.

896
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,489
Try the mint.

897
01:05:03,204 --> 01:05:05,500
It doesn't go with the hair.

898
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,506
Try the pink and black.

899
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:12,612
This is okay. This I don't-

900
01:05:13,627 --> 01:05:15,854
You need to go get a tan or something.

901
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,221
Move.

902
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:40,400
Okay.

903
01:05:40,841 --> 01:05:43,430
I don't want you playing
that character on the show.

904
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,549
But that outfit will work.

905
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,680
Photograph her and bag it.

906
01:05:57,441 --> 01:05:58,858
Ginger: Hey.

907
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,600
Chaos: I was beginning to give up.

908
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,162
Ginger: Sorry, it took
longer than I thought.

909
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:07,670
I was thinking about
the play this morning.

910
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,871
Actually quite liberating just playing

911
01:06:09,871 --> 01:06:11,611
with your own personal hangups.

912
01:06:11,611 --> 01:06:13,730
Madonna: No!
Ginger: Hey.

913
01:06:14,235 --> 01:06:15,175
Chaos: Well that's good because now you're

914
01:06:15,175 --> 01:06:17,277
going to do a make-a-mess show.

915
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,680
Ginger: What do I do?

916
01:06:20,265 --> 01:06:23,830
Chaos: Just approach it like
we've been playing in class.

917
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,986
Ginger: That's it? That's all I get?

918
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:27,287
Chaos: Yeah.

919
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,592
Ginger: Let's do this.

920
01:06:34,795 --> 01:06:36,696
Madonna:.

921
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:38,799
Gorgeous.

922
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:56,160
Chaos: And now the moment
you've been waiting for.

923
01:06:56,369 --> 01:07:00,200
I give you Ginger and the
Corn Flake.

924
01:07:31,493 --> 01:07:33,808
Ginger: Okay, okay.

925
01:08:33,186 --> 01:08:36,717
Audience: One, two, three!

926
01:08:44,994 --> 01:08:48,428
I'm so sorry!

927
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,774
Okay, ready?

928
01:09:35,278 --> 01:09:38,578
Audience: One, two, three!

929
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:13,314
Chaos: Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Corn Flake Queen.

930
01:10:17,317 --> 01:10:18,720
That's our show for today.

931
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,521
If we made you laugh and clap,
by the looks of it we have,

932
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:25,425
then please show some
contribution with the hat.

933
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,532
Ginger: Thank you guys.

934
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:34,340
Thank you, you were great.

935
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:49,149
Woman: Great show.

936
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:51,351
Boy: Can I get a photo of you?

937
01:10:55,129 --> 01:10:57,357
Woman: Can I get a photo of you two?

938
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:58,759
Ginger: Sure.

939
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:07,768
Woman:.

940
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:11,372
Ginger: Oh my God, I've
got corn flakes everywhere.

941
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,819
Oh my God, it's going to be cold.

942
01:12:11,863 --> 01:12:13,733
You're a jerk.

943
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:24,245
I have Corn Flakes in my ear..

944
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:29,549
It's just that I thought you didn't

945
01:12:29,549 --> 01:12:31,752
have relationships with students.

946
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,854
Chaos: You're not really a student.

947
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:42,162
Ginger: So is that what we're
doing, having a relationship?

948
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:44,365
Chaos: Not if you keep talking.

949
01:12:46,566 --> 01:12:48,869
Ginger: What about your
relationship with Dancer?

950
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:52,341
Chaos: We have an open relationship so

951
01:12:53,264 --> 01:12:54,874
it's not an issue for her.

952
01:12:57,478 --> 01:13:02,478
Ginger: But it's an issue for me.

953
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:11,891
Chaos: You're right, it's
not going to work out.

954
01:13:15,526 --> 01:13:17,899
Ginger: What did she want to
talk to you about today anyway?

955
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,302
Chaos: She wants me to work
with her at Ringling Brothers.

956
01:13:24,504 --> 01:13:26,206
Ginger: That's fantastic.

957
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,710
Chaos: We're a bit too competitive.

958
01:13:31,312 --> 01:13:34,115
She hasn't surrendered to
the experience like you do.

959
01:13:35,215 --> 01:13:39,190
Ginger: I can't do anything
else, it's too terrifying.

960
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:43,423
Chaos: You know this was a one-time only,

961
01:13:43,424 --> 01:13:45,126
you working my show?

962
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:46,527
Ginger: Okay.

963
01:13:47,098 --> 01:13:48,529
You need to come up with your own show

964
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:50,231
for what you're calling
a "relationship" to work.

965
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:51,731
Ginger: That's what I want anyway.

966
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:54,435
Chaos: We need to be
two individual people,

967
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:55,936
not dependent on one another.

968
01:13:55,936 --> 01:13:58,838
Ginger: All right, I get it.

969
01:14:03,442 --> 01:14:05,246
I think I'm going to go.

970
01:14:07,147 --> 01:14:08,949
It's been a long day.

971
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:32,573
Chaos: We need to give space for

972
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:34,475
the winds of time to blow between us.

973
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:51,691
Ginger: Hi-

974
01:14:55,497 --> 01:14:56,998
What?

975
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:00,100
Darlene: Darling what
did you do to your hair?

976
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:03,703
Ginger: Uh ...

977
01:15:05,906 --> 01:15:08,408
It's just time for a change.

978
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,812
Darlene: I need a drink.

979
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:13,914
Ginger: No, no, no you don't.

980
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:16,116
It's fine, it's not a problem.

981
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:19,419
Darlene: You sabotage
any opportunity to work,

982
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:21,423
after all that we've worked for-

983
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:23,123
Ginger: No I'm not.

984
01:15:23,123 --> 01:15:25,626
The designer today, he really likes it.

985
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:29,930
Darlene: He liked it?

986
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,435
Ginger: Yes, and he
treated me differently.

987
01:15:33,435 --> 01:15:37,938
Like I was a real person
and not just some mannequin.

988
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,442
Darlene: Well ...

989
01:15:44,611 --> 01:15:47,347
It limits your opportunity to work.

990
01:15:48,148 --> 01:15:50,650
Ginger: Okay, fine.

991
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,554
Darlene: So you are trying
to sabotage your career.

992
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:55,557
Ginger: What do you want from me?

993
01:15:57,858 --> 01:16:00,260
Darlene: Darling, I want what

994
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,863
any mother wants for her daughter.

995
01:16:04,165 --> 01:16:07,670
I want you to get married,
and have children,

996
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:10,470
and have a successful career
as you get older, like me.

997
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:15,676
Ginger: Saddest thing I've ever heard.

998
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,482
Mom I love you.

999
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:27,988
But I don't want to be you.

1000
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,293
Good night.

1001
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,601
Jeff: Hi.

1002
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,703
Ginger: Hi. I don't think mom's up yet.

1003
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:45,206
Is she expecting you?

1004
01:16:45,806 --> 01:16:47,308
Jeff: I came to see you.

1005
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:51,312
Ginger: Oh. Come in.

1006
01:16:58,812 --> 01:17:00,520
Jeff: What happened to your hair?

1007
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,623
Ginger: It's my new look.

1008
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:06,260
You don't like it?

1009
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,928
Jeff: It's different.

1010
01:17:09,922 --> 01:17:11,332
Ginger: Yeah.

1011
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:15,335
Jeff: I wanted to ask you to marry me.

1012
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:20,741
Will you?

1013
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,347
Ginger: Um ... Hm.

1014
01:17:29,332 --> 01:17:31,351
Gee, Jeff, I thought maybe you

1015
01:17:31,351 --> 01:17:36,351
might ask me on a date, or something.

1016
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:40,761
Because we should do that first,
to get to know each other.

1017
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:43,563
Right?

1018
01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:45,660
Jeff: I guess.

1019
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,666
I'm not very good at that so I thought

1020
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:48,868
I'd skip to the next.

1021
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:57,178
Ginger: You're bit of
a clown, you know that?

1022
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,381
No, no, I meant that in a good way.

1023
01:18:00,882 --> 01:18:04,485
I've been doing some
clowning down by the beach.

1024
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:06,286
Jeff: Clowning?

1025
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:07,787
Ginger: Yeah.

1026
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:14,190
Have you ever, I don't
know, gone bungee jumping

1027
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:17,998
off a high bridge, or
skydiving, mountain climbing?

1028
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:20,400
No? Huh.

1029
01:18:21,101 --> 01:18:25,706
Me neither, but I think
it must feel something

1030
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:29,210
like what clowning on the street does.

1031
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,916
Jeff: So is that a no?

1032
01:18:39,017 --> 01:18:41,121
Ginger: No?

1033
01:18:41,422 --> 01:18:42,823
Jeff: It wasn't a yes though, was it?

1034
01:18:42,823 --> 01:18:44,325
Ginger: No.

1035
01:18:48,173 --> 01:18:49,345
Jeff: Okay.

1036
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:50,631
Ginger: Okay.

1037
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:55,235
Jeff: I'll check it out.

1038
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:58,380
Ginger: Yeah, the show.
Check out the show.

1039
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,445
Thank you.

1040
01:19:14,554 --> 01:19:16,857
Dancer: It's the clown student
back for more punishment.

1041
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:17,958
Ginger: Loving every minute.

1042
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:19,760
Dancer: Now we'll see how long that lasts.

1043
01:19:26,575 --> 01:19:29,370
Ginger: Hey.

1044
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:33,574
Did you tell her?

1045
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:35,575
Chaos: What?

1046
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:37,479
Ginger: Nothing.

1047
01:19:37,978 --> 01:19:39,279
Why's she here?

1048
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:40,981
Chaos: Ringling Brothers needs a decision.

1049
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:43,484
Ginger: It's obvious, isn't it?

1050
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:45,850
Chaos: And she wants to get married.

1051
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:52,194
Ginger: Would that be an open marriage

1052
01:19:52,194 --> 01:19:54,695
or the more traditional kind?

1053
01:19:54,695 --> 01:19:56,866
Chaos: I don't know. She
gets these ideas in her.

1054
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,900
Ginger: This just must
be a day for proposals.

1055
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:03,442
Chaos: You're down late.

1056
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:05,305
Madonna: I couldn't sleep.

1057
01:20:05,606 --> 01:20:10,100
So, how is our Corn
Flake clown queen today?

1058
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:12,412
Ginger: Unmarried.

1059
01:20:14,214 --> 01:20:15,916
Chaos: Dancer's here, everybody.

1060
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:19,220
Madonna: I think that would
be a good title for your show,

1061
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:22,122
"The Unmarried Clown Show"

1062
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,826
The pitch is empty, who's up?

1063
01:20:27,728 --> 01:20:29,129
Chaos: It's me.

1064
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:47,647
Dancer: Hey.

1065
01:20:50,717 --> 01:20:52,520
How's it hanging?

1066
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,653
Madonna: Not bad.

1067
01:20:54,255 --> 01:20:55,456
I hate my show, but it's still

1068
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:58,258
earning so I feel a little trapped.

1069
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,162
Dancer: Trapped by your own success.

1070
01:21:00,162 --> 01:21:01,662
Madonna: Ugh.

1071
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:05,866
Dancer: You want to share?

1072
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:07,267
Madonna: Oh, sure.

1073
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,276
Dancer: What about you,
clown student, do you smoke?

1074
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,781
Ginger: My name is
Ginger, and no, I don't.

1075
01:21:25,023 --> 01:21:28,880
Madonna: Ginger did a great
number in Chaos' show last night.

1076
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,690
Dancer: Mm, she did, did she?

1077
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:31,692
Madonna: Yeah. I've got it on my phone.

1078
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:34,594
Ginger: You did? Can I see?

1079
01:21:34,695 --> 01:21:36,960
Madonna: Yeah.

1080
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:46,206
Ginger: Oh my God.

1081
01:21:47,512 --> 01:21:48,908
I love it.

1082
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:00,722
Dancer: Very good.

1083
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:04,525
Ginger: Ah, the colors are
so pretty on your phone.

1084
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:11,131
Hey, can I make a copy of this?

1085
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:14,340
Madonna: Yeah, I'll put it on
my blog and you can download it.

1086
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,235
Ginger: Thanks.

1087
01:22:16,334 --> 01:22:18,839
Dancer: What you need now is experience.

1088
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:21,410
Ginger: Yeah.

1089
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:28,148
Dancer: You can do something
in my show if you want.

1090
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:29,550
Ginger: Really?

1091
01:22:32,353 --> 01:22:33,653
Okay.

1092
01:22:45,681 --> 01:22:48,391
Dancer: Ooh, we've got a first timer.

1093
01:23:01,882 --> 01:23:04,884
You want to do this
one, that's a good one.

1094
01:23:06,264 --> 01:23:09,289
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, there we go.

1095
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,193
You want to do this
one, that's a good one.

1096
01:23:21,645 --> 01:23:25,505
Very nice ladies, watch out for those two.

1097
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:56,836
Woman: Oh!

1098
01:23:56,836 --> 01:23:57,660
Ginger: Sorry.

1099
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,440
Woman: Ah, ah, ah, ah!

1100
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,351
Ginger: No, no, no. It's
okay. See? It's fine.

1101
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:22,662
Chaos: I warned you about her.

1102
01:24:26,202 --> 01:24:28,368
Just lie down and let
your emotions settle.

1103
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,980
When I say that's the
last time you get to do

1104
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,782
a guest spot on my show I
didn't mean for you to go and

1105
01:24:41,782 --> 01:24:44,584
prostitute yourself out
with the other performers.

1106
01:24:45,285 --> 01:24:47,188
Ginger: She got me stoned.

1107
01:24:49,009 --> 01:24:50,991
Chaos: Yeah, she likes to do that.

1108
01:24:54,294 --> 01:24:56,496
My point is, it's better
if you get your own show.

1109
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,900
Madonna: The Unmarried Clown Show.

1110
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:03,103
Ginger: Sounds like my
mother's worst nightmare.

1111
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:05,105
Chaos: Excellent.

1112
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:07,507
When I gave you the other day.

1113
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,410
Ginger: Yeah but that didn't work.

1114
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,312
Chaos: You really didn't do
the structure we gave you.

1115
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:15,616
Ginger: I tried, I just
kept making mistakes.

1116
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:18,218
Madonna: There are no mistakes, Ginger.

1117
01:25:19,874 --> 01:25:22,623
Ginger: Yeah, because
failure is good, right?

1118
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:25,125
Chaos: Yeah, and that was
the first time you tried it.

1119
01:25:25,225 --> 01:25:27,128
It takes many experiments
to perfect a show.

1120
01:25:27,128 --> 01:25:30,300
You have to do it over
and over, again and again.

1121
01:25:30,331 --> 01:25:32,832
That's why when you get
successful it's so hard to change.

1122
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,334
Isn't that right, Madonna?

1123
01:25:34,995 --> 01:25:37,714
Madonna: Oh, no.

1124
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,442
Chaos: Remember, no mistakes.

1125
01:25:43,544 --> 01:25:45,345
Ginger: Now you really
have to do something new.

1126
01:25:58,759 --> 01:26:01,161
Madonna: Maybe I'll take that
clown master class tomorrow.

1127
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:02,270
Chaos: Yeah, I am.

1128
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:03,864
Madonna: Are you really?

1129
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,166
Chaos: It's a visiting
teacher from New York.

1130
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:08,269
Ginger: Maybe I should take it too.

1131
01:26:08,368 --> 01:26:10,170
Chaos: Eh, he might scare it out of you.

1132
01:26:10,272 --> 01:26:13,474
And it's not cheap. 500 dollars.

1133
01:26:13,674 --> 01:26:15,613
Madonna: 500?

1134
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:21,682
Maybe I'll just work on this
old thing by myself instead.

1135
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,386
Ginger: But failure is good, right?

1136
01:26:25,386 --> 01:26:27,988
Madonna: Hey, listen
here, you cheeky newcomer.

1137
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,491
Don't confront me with my
own words unless you're

1138
01:26:29,491 --> 01:26:31,691
ready to put it in practice yourself.

1139
01:26:46,121 --> 01:26:47,808
Darlene: Ginger?

1140
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:51,110
Ginger: Yeah, I just
have to pee really fast.

1141
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:52,312
I will be right back.

1142
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:53,714
Darlene: Let me see you.

1143
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,180
Ginger: See? I'm all right.

1144
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:02,406
I just fell down.

1145
01:27:04,084 --> 01:27:06,260
Darlene: Have you been
hanging out with those clowns?

1146
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,128
I told you they were dangerous.

1147
01:27:08,128 --> 01:27:09,729
Ginger: It wasn't while I was clowning.

1148
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,330
Darlene: If you put yourself
out there it will happen.

1149
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:17,537
Ginger: I'm supposed to stay
stuck in here with you?

1150
01:27:18,168 --> 01:27:20,240
Darlene: Are you on drugs?

1151
01:27:20,856 --> 01:27:24,645
Ginger: No. I'm tired.

1152
01:27:25,646 --> 01:27:27,547
I'm going to go take a nap.

1153
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:31,451
Darlene: We have that
fashion show in an hour.

1154
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:36,556
It better be a quick nap.

1155
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,762
Don't worry, I'm going to take you.

1156
01:27:44,865 --> 01:27:46,467
Ginger: Great.

1157
01:27:50,371 --> 01:27:52,172
Darlene: Ginger, Ginger darling.

1158
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:54,175
I thought you had three
changes this evening.

1159
01:27:54,175 --> 01:27:55,976
Ginger: No, I'm just doing one.

1160
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,779
Darlene: But they paid for three.

1161
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:00,620
I'm going to talk to Jamie.

1162
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,712
Ginger: No-

1163
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:04,784
Darlene: Jamie, darling. Hi.

1164
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:07,788
How come Ginger only has
one outfit this evening?

1165
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:10,900
Jamie: Because her hair
doesn't work with the others.

1166
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:13,593
You're very lucky you
have a creative daughter,

1167
01:28:13,593 --> 01:28:16,970
but it's not really what
you what in a model.

1168
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,600
Darlene: It's not what you
want in a model, is it.

1169
01:28:22,203 --> 01:28:24,405
Don't be creative this evening.

1170
01:28:24,405 --> 01:28:25,906
Ginger: Don't be creative?

1171
01:28:26,137 --> 01:28:27,307
Mom, you're not helping.

1172
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:28,909
Just stay out of it.

1173
01:28:33,884 --> 01:28:35,416
Darlene: What are you looking at?

1174
01:28:56,937 --> 01:28:58,380
Ginger: Happy?

1175
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,439
Darlene: Of course, dear.

1176
01:29:02,264 --> 01:29:04,144
Ginger: Hey, um.

1177
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:07,434
There's this master class

1178
01:29:07,434 --> 01:29:09,650
clown teacher I want to take tomorrow.

1179
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:11,651
Darlene: How much is it?

1180
01:29:12,152 --> 01:29:13,754
Ginger: 500.

1181
01:29:13,754 --> 01:29:16,171
Darlene: 500 dollars?
You've got to be joking.

1182
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:18,359
Ginger: Mom, please.
This is for my career.

1183
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:19,860
Darlene: This is your career!

1184
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,462
You're running away from your
career to do all this nonsense.

1185
01:29:22,462 --> 01:29:24,164
Ginger: It's not nonsense.

1186
01:29:25,578 --> 01:29:29,470
Look, just think of it as
an advance on my allowance.

1187
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:31,372
Or you can take it out of the trust.

1188
01:29:31,372 --> 01:29:32,873
I mean, that's my money.

1189
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:42,383
Darlene: No. I'm not going to allow it.

1190
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:49,289
Ginger: Wow, you're hopeless.

1191
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,930
I wish just once you
would support my dreams.

1192
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,897
But it's your dreams I'm
always having to live up to.

1193
01:30:17,718 --> 01:30:19,042
Woman: How do you want to pay?

1194
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:23,324
Debit or credit?

1195
01:30:23,324 --> 01:30:24,724
Ginger: Debit.

1196
01:30:29,459 --> 01:30:30,731
Woman: Thanks.

1197
01:30:30,731 --> 01:30:32,232
Instructor: Take a big breath in,

1198
01:30:32,232 --> 01:30:34,134
and touch on whatever that place is.

1199
01:30:34,134 --> 01:30:36,637
And let the sound out on the out breath.

1200
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:51,651
Close your eyes and take a big breath.

1201
01:30:52,753 --> 01:30:55,756
Now, don't listen to anyone else.

1202
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:58,558
Focus on your expression and let

1203
01:30:58,558 --> 01:31:00,760
out a noise on the out breath.

1204
01:31:13,173 --> 01:31:15,776
Instructor: Wonderful work
when you let go of your habits.

1205
01:31:16,276 --> 01:31:17,877
Okay, who's next?

1206
01:31:18,879 --> 01:31:21,282
Come on, I know there's one left.

1207
01:31:21,983 --> 01:31:23,683
Who's hiding?

1208
01:31:31,392 --> 01:31:34,694
Okay, you are looking for love.

1209
01:31:35,695 --> 01:31:37,499
Ginger: Do I get an object?

1210
01:31:37,499 --> 01:31:38,698
Instructor: Nope.

1211
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,202
Ginger: Okay.

1212
01:32:07,735 --> 01:32:10,831
Instructor: No taking
audience members on to stage.

1213
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,333
Ginger: Um ...

1214
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:14,635
Instructor: Don't stop, you're doing well.

1215
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:16,537
Ginger: I know but I was
going to use him in my piece.

1216
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:19,339
Instructor: I know, and
I'm not letting you,

1217
01:32:19,339 --> 01:32:21,241
because that's another exercise.

1218
01:32:27,648 --> 01:32:30,552
We all know you love Chaos, but what we

1219
01:32:30,552 --> 01:32:34,454
want to see is why you need love so much.

1220
01:32:35,556 --> 01:32:37,458
Keep going, you were doing well.

1221
01:32:41,282 --> 01:32:43,163
You were looking for love.

1222
01:32:50,883 --> 01:32:52,572
What are you doing?

1223
01:32:53,874 --> 01:32:57,477
Ginger: I was looking for love.

1224
01:32:57,778 --> 01:32:59,880
Instructor: We want to
see you reveal yourself.

1225
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,820
We don't want to see you
telling us a silly story.

1226
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,184
Go back to what you were doing

1227
01:33:04,184 --> 01:33:06,787
at the start, that was working.

1228
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:15,397
Ginger: I'm sorry I ...

1229
01:33:16,196 --> 01:33:17,897
I don't know how.

1230
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,402
Instructor: Well, thank goodness

1231
01:33:21,402 --> 01:33:23,103
you're expressing yourself now.

1232
01:33:25,906 --> 01:33:27,608
Chaos: Ginger wait.

1233
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:31,612
Okay, I know what happened in
there sucked, but I warned you.

1234
01:33:31,912 --> 01:33:33,413
Ginger: I can't do it.

1235
01:33:33,915 --> 01:33:34,915
Chaos: Yet.

1236
01:33:34,915 --> 01:33:36,917
Ginger: Yeah, I can't do it yet.

1237
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:40,121
Chaos: I think you need to
figure out why you're doing it.

1238
01:33:41,722 --> 01:33:44,925
Ginger: Usually this is the
point where you come over and

1239
01:33:45,694 --> 01:33:49,290
give me a big hug, tell me
that I'm a really good clown,

1240
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:51,331
and that I should keep going.

1241
01:33:51,832 --> 01:33:53,234
Chaos: It doesn't matter what I say.

1242
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:54,535
Ginger: It matters to me.

1243
01:33:57,537 --> 01:33:58,138
Chaos: See, this is what I meant

1244
01:33:58,138 --> 01:33:59,739
by an independent relationship.

1245
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,743
We each need to take
responsibility for our own growth.

1246
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,470
Can you feel the winds of time?

1247
01:34:10,452 --> 01:34:12,252
Ginger: Yeah, I do.

1248
01:37:01,122 --> 01:37:03,324
Darlene: I'm very disappointed in you.

1249
01:37:04,077 --> 01:37:05,663
Hand it over.

1250
01:37:08,469 --> 01:37:10,300
Ginger: I'm going to pay you back.

1251
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,232
Darlene: Yeah you will.

1252
01:37:11,232 --> 01:37:13,233
You betrayed my faith in you.

1253
01:37:16,127 --> 01:37:18,339
Ginger: I kind of had a big day.

1254
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,340
I just need to take some time.

1255
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,420
Darlene: Maybe you should
find it somewhere else.

1256
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,545
Ginger: I really don't need
this from you right now.

1257
01:37:24,545 --> 01:37:25,646
Darlene: And I do?

1258
01:37:25,646 --> 01:37:26,946
Ginger: Apparently.

1259
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:30,500
Darlene: I am not going to
support your wayward lifestyle.

1260
01:37:31,157 --> 01:37:34,854
Ginger: Okay, we're talking
about a theater workshop.

1261
01:37:35,655 --> 01:37:37,557
Darlene: You abused my trust.

1262
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,360
There have to be consequences.

1263
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,162
Ginger: Fine, whatever.

1264
01:37:44,965 --> 01:37:47,367
Darlene: The Top Model
competition's tomorrow.

1265
01:37:50,822 --> 01:37:52,373
Ginger: I've actually been
thinking about that and I-

1266
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:54,090
Darlene: Ginger, if you don't do this then

1267
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:56,477
it's the end of the road with my support!

1268
01:37:56,477 --> 01:37:58,779
Ginger: This is exactly
how you manipulate me.

1269
01:38:01,382 --> 01:38:02,783
Darlene: It's your choice.

1270
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:05,850
Ginger: Oh, my choice.

1271
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:15,296
Fine, I'll do it, but I'm
only doing this for you.

1272
01:38:16,297 --> 01:38:18,299
Darlene: Well don't worry,
I'll be there to support you.

1273
01:38:18,299 --> 01:38:19,801
Ginger: I don't want you there.

1274
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:24,504
Oh, and just so you know, I'm
starting my own street show.

1275
01:38:32,313 --> 01:38:34,214
Madonna: So exciting!

1276
01:38:34,952 --> 01:38:37,618
All right, last one.

1277
01:38:42,723 --> 01:38:44,426
Ah,.

1278
01:38:47,127 --> 01:38:49,730
Ginger: I love her. She's so inspiring.

1279
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:52,132
Chaos: She's doing really good.

1280
01:38:53,078 --> 01:38:56,537
Ginger: I got a little crows
yesterday, after the workshop.

1281
01:38:57,622 --> 01:38:59,139
Chaos: Good for you.

1282
01:38:59,339 --> 01:39:01,741
Ginger: I think I'm starting
to see how this all works.

1283
01:39:06,648 --> 01:39:07,847
Okay.

1284
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:12,345
Do you think, if I could
get three men up on stage,

1285
01:39:12,753 --> 01:39:15,356
I could have a competition for my love?

1286
01:39:16,757 --> 01:39:18,358
Chaos: Sure.

1287
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:20,760
Ginger: It could be like,

1288
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:23,664
a competition for my hand in marriage.

1289
01:39:24,165 --> 01:39:26,670
And it could be a dance
competition because, you know,

1290
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,670
my husband has to be able to dance.

1291
01:39:30,454 --> 01:39:31,971
Chaos: You should try.

1292
01:39:33,796 --> 01:39:35,752
Ginger: Can you do it?

1293
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:41,982
Chaos: If I'm in the mood.

1294
01:39:43,907 --> 01:39:45,786
Ginger: Are you in the mood now?

1295
01:39:49,551 --> 01:39:51,692
Chaos: I could be persuaded.

1296
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,415
Ginger: Mom? What are you doing here?

1297
01:40:15,415 --> 01:40:16,917
Darlene: It's a big day.

1298
01:40:16,917 --> 01:40:19,220
We've got to get you ready
for the Top Model competition.

1299
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,222
Ginger: I said I didn't need your help.

1300
01:40:21,222 --> 01:40:22,923
Darlene: Oh, I won't be
there this afternoon,

1301
01:40:22,923 --> 01:40:25,826
but obviously you need
my help to get ready.

1302
01:40:27,379 --> 01:40:28,829
Ginger: Get ready?

1303
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:32,232
Darlene: Hair, makeup, facials, oh my God.

1304
01:40:32,632 --> 01:40:35,135
Darling, you've got to look your best.

1305
01:40:36,138 --> 01:40:37,638
Chaos: Your mother really loves you.

1306
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:40,240
Ginger: Yeah, I promised
I'd do this for her.

1307
01:40:44,572 --> 01:40:46,246
Darlene: Nice meeting you.

1308
01:40:56,256 --> 01:40:58,358
Ginger who was that boy you were kissing?

1309
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:02,763
Ginger: A friend.

1310
01:41:03,164 --> 01:41:05,765
A friend who's helping me
put together a new show.

1311
01:41:08,083 --> 01:41:09,971
Darlene: Are you in love with him?

1312
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:12,373
Ginger: Mom. Can we not do the darling

1313
01:41:12,373 --> 01:41:14,474
inquisition right before Top Model?

1314
01:41:19,379 --> 01:41:21,682
Darlene: I still don't know
why you don't want me there.

1315
01:41:24,285 --> 01:41:27,388
Ginger: Because you have
to live your own dreams.

1316
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,191
Jeff: I'm really excited.

1317
01:41:31,907 --> 01:41:34,394
Think about what this is
going to do for our careers.

1318
01:41:40,802 --> 01:41:42,902
Woman: Ginger Carmichael.

1319
01:41:58,218 --> 01:41:59,821
Man: Are you wearing underwear?

1320
01:42:05,425 --> 01:42:07,329
Could you take your clothes off please?

1321
01:42:09,799 --> 01:42:11,631
Ginger: I'm sorry?

1322
01:42:11,916 --> 01:42:14,634
Man: We'd like to see
you in your underwear.

1323
01:42:51,772 --> 01:42:53,874
Do a couple of turns up
and down the catwalk,

1324
01:42:53,874 --> 01:42:56,276
then stop at the end and say your name.

1325
01:43:45,568 --> 01:43:47,127
Ginger: Ooh.

1326
01:44:05,921 --> 01:44:07,848
Oh, yeah!

1327
01:44:08,548 --> 01:44:12,353
Oh, oh, oh!

1328
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:26,868
Thank you.

1329
01:45:05,044 --> 01:45:06,906
Darlene: So how did it go?

1330
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:12,913
Ginger: Mom, listen.

1331
01:45:16,516 --> 01:45:19,519
Top Model is just not my thing.

1332
01:45:21,823 --> 01:45:23,223
Darlene: What do you mean?

1333
01:45:24,925 --> 01:45:26,927
Ginger: I don't want to do it.

1334
01:45:29,831 --> 01:45:31,532
Darlene: You deliberately threw it off.

1335
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:32,733
Ginger: Why would I say it's not my

1336
01:45:32,733 --> 01:45:35,360
thing if I deliberately threw it off?

1337
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:35,937
Darlene: You deliberately threw the

1338
01:45:35,937 --> 01:45:38,538
opportunity that we've worked so hard for!

1339
01:45:38,538 --> 01:45:40,642
That's why you didn't want me there!

1340
01:45:40,741 --> 01:45:42,944
Ginger: You're jumping to
conclusions. This is not-

1341
01:45:44,845 --> 01:45:46,446
Darlene: Darlene.

1342
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:54,154
Yeah.

1343
01:45:55,457 --> 01:45:56,857
Thank you.

1344
01:46:04,264 --> 01:46:06,366
They said you did a striptease.

1345
01:46:07,367 --> 01:46:10,571
And you performed an orgasm
with a fire extinguisher.

1346
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:13,874
Ginger: Okay. They told
me to take my clothes off.

1347
01:46:13,874 --> 01:46:18,874
So yeah, I performed an orgasm
with a fire extinguisher.

1348
01:46:21,482 --> 01:46:23,183
Darlene: Why would you do that?

1349
01:46:24,785 --> 01:46:29,785
Ginger: I can't fit into
this box that you want me to.

1350
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:32,193
I have to be myself.

1351
01:46:36,797 --> 01:46:38,198
Mom?

1352
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:41,200
Darlene: I warned you about this.

1353
01:46:46,206 --> 01:46:48,408
You're going to have to
find somewhere else to live.

1354
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:52,112
It's for your own good.

1355
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:00,421
Ginger: Fine.

1356
01:47:02,322 --> 01:47:04,725
This is all too exhausting anyway.

1357
01:47:14,095 --> 01:47:16,637
Chaos: You know you're welcome
to stay as long as you like.

1358
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,540
Ginger: Oh no, you are not getting

1359
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,343
me into your bed that easily, sir.

1360
01:47:25,846 --> 01:47:29,490
Chaos: Okay, so you're
going to play hard to get?

1361
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:31,551
There's a spare mattress over there.

1362
01:47:33,322 --> 01:47:34,547
Ginger: Good.

1363
01:47:37,457 --> 01:47:39,359
Chaos: But uh, I wouldn't recommend

1364
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:41,562
on holding out until we're married.

1365
01:47:43,464 --> 01:47:45,466
Ginger: chance of that.

1366
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:01,281
But, you didn't think there was

1367
01:48:01,281 --> 01:48:03,784
much chance in a relationship either.

1368
01:48:04,184 --> 01:48:07,788
So, I live in hope.

1369
01:48:14,895 --> 01:48:17,697
What happened with Dancer and Ringling?

1370
01:48:20,701 --> 01:48:22,403
Chaos: They offered me the job.

1371
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,806
Ginger: Wow.

1372
01:48:27,508 --> 01:48:29,509
Chaos: But I told them
I'm not going to take it.

1373
01:48:36,788 --> 01:48:39,420
Ginger: I guess I'm lucky
I caught you when I did.

1374
01:48:43,724 --> 01:48:46,626
Chaos: Despite the inherent
foolishness of the task,

1375
01:48:47,228 --> 01:48:50,330
I'm now ready to form a
deep, committed relationship,

1376
01:48:51,744 --> 01:48:53,235
with you.

1377
01:48:53,271 --> 01:48:54,835
Ginger: With me?

1378
01:49:21,954 --> 01:49:24,164
A little fast for me.

1379
01:49:27,968 --> 01:49:29,770
I think I should go home.

1380
01:49:31,948 --> 01:49:33,974
Chaos: I thought you said you can't go.

1381
01:49:34,675 --> 01:49:36,877
Ginger: She.

1382
01:49:36,877 --> 01:49:38,679
She just wants what's best for me.

1383
01:49:41,082 --> 01:49:43,383
I think she'll understand when I explain.

1384
01:49:51,292 --> 01:49:52,792
Mom.

1385
01:49:52,993 --> 01:49:56,097
Sorry, I didn't know you'd
be going to bed so early.

1386
01:49:56,297 --> 01:49:57,798
Darlene: I'm not.

1387
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:00,802
Ginger: Look, I know you told me

1388
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:01,802
to find somewhere else to stay-

1389
01:50:01,802 --> 01:50:03,404
Darlene: I'm sorry Ginger.

1390
01:50:03,404 --> 01:50:05,305
Ginger: If you would just let me explain.

1391
01:50:05,921 --> 01:50:09,911
I think my that chastity is in greater

1392
01:50:09,911 --> 01:50:13,113
danger if you throw me out.

1393
01:50:14,114 --> 01:50:16,918
Darlene: I'm not going to fall
for that sort of manipulation.

1394
01:50:16,918 --> 01:50:18,708
You wanted your freedom, you got it.

1395
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:20,243
Ginger: Fine. I'm just
going to grab some clothes.

1396
01:50:20,243 --> 01:50:22,223
Darlene: It's not a good time.

1397
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:23,624
Ginger: Now you're just being silly.

1398
01:50:23,624 --> 01:50:25,140
Darlene: It's not a good time!

1399
01:50:44,045 --> 01:50:46,446
Ginger: Jeff, what are you doing here?

1400
01:50:49,526 --> 01:50:54,354
Jeff: Your mother and I were
just catching up on some work.

1401
01:50:57,558 --> 01:50:59,359
I got through the Top Model heat.

1402
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,266
Ginger: That's great.

1403
01:51:07,367 --> 01:51:09,069
For both of you.

1404
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:25,180
I realized I have to make
the decision for myself.

1405
01:51:28,428 --> 01:51:30,190
To do what I want.

1406
01:51:36,897 --> 01:51:39,099
Can you get out the other mattress?

1407
01:51:41,432 --> 01:51:42,802
Chaos: Sure.

1408
01:52:29,768 --> 01:52:30,889
Hey.

1409
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:45,666
What's up man, how's it going?

1410
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:47,067
Good.

1411
01:52:48,143 --> 01:52:50,270
Looks like I'm getting a job
with the Ringling Brothers.

1412
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:52,156
Ginger: Are you and
Dancer getting married?

1413
01:52:52,448 --> 01:52:54,274
How did you guys know about that?

1414
01:52:55,059 --> 01:52:56,777
We haven't told anybody yet.

1415
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:02,067
Ginger: Just a lucky guess.

1416
01:53:02,883 --> 01:53:04,684
So, are you guys
doing a show together?

1417
01:53:04,785 --> 01:53:06,386
Chaos: No, she's got her own.

1418
01:53:06,987 --> 01:53:08,388
That was quick.

1419
01:53:08,388 --> 01:53:10,290
Chaos: I know, she's tenacious.

1420
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:13,385
Ew.

1421
01:53:13,385 --> 01:53:14,302
Ginger: Shut up.

1422
01:53:14,595 --> 01:53:16,034
Excellent.

1423
01:53:16,034 --> 01:53:18,400
Hi, hello everyone.

1424
01:53:18,899 --> 01:53:20,500
Are you having a good day?

1425
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:23,204
Meet my chicken, he's my friend.

1426
01:53:23,204 --> 01:53:24,605
How's it going?

1427
01:53:26,013 --> 01:53:27,807
Hey guys, come watch.

1428
01:53:28,008 --> 01:53:29,910
It's not scary, I promise.

1429
01:53:30,312 --> 01:53:31,913
We're nice people.

1430
01:53:31,913 --> 01:53:33,714
Hi, how are you?

1431
01:53:34,216 --> 01:53:35,717
Will you stand here for me?

1432
01:53:35,816 --> 01:53:37,617
I promise I'll be really nice to you.

1433
01:53:40,629 --> 01:53:42,522
How you doing?

1434
01:53:42,522 --> 01:53:44,124
Can I have a high five from you too?

1435
01:53:44,124 --> 01:53:45,826
I love it.

1436
01:53:45,826 --> 01:53:47,227
How are you all doing?

1437
01:53:47,427 --> 01:53:49,630
I'm going to do a show
for you, is that okay?

1438
01:53:50,031 --> 01:53:51,431
Awesome.

1439
01:53:54,425 --> 01:53:56,036
I'm going to tell you all a little story

1440
01:53:56,036 --> 01:53:58,039
but I'm going to need you to help me out.

1441
01:53:58,439 --> 01:54:00,741
I need you to learn two things.

1442
01:54:00,741 --> 01:54:02,642
When I do this, I want you to scream like

1443
01:54:02,642 --> 01:54:05,045
you've never been so excited in your life.

1444
01:54:05,447 --> 01:54:06,347
Man: Yeah!

1445
01:54:06,347 --> 01:54:08,449
Ginger: Oh, he's got
it. He's totally got it.

1446
01:54:08,449 --> 01:54:09,850
I want everyone else match that. Ready?

1447
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:11,451
One, two, three.

1448
01:54:13,253 --> 01:54:15,960
We don't even have to do it
twice, you guys are so good.

1449
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,257
All right, one more thing.

1450
01:54:17,257 --> 01:54:20,361
When I point down I want you
to scream, "No way!" Ready?

1451
01:54:20,361 --> 01:54:21,862
Audience: No way!

1452
01:54:21,862 --> 01:54:22,986
Ginger: Try this one.

1453
01:54:24,164 --> 01:54:24,865
This one.

1454
01:54:24,865 --> 01:54:26,067
Audience: No way!

1455
01:54:26,067 --> 01:54:28,050
Ginger: I think you guys
got it, you're awesome.

1456
01:54:28,050 --> 01:54:31,171
My name is Ginger, and I'm a clown.

1457
01:54:31,271 --> 01:54:34,174
And today, I was kicked out of my home.

1458
01:54:34,174 --> 01:54:35,776
Audience: No way!

1459
01:54:35,776 --> 01:54:37,162
Ginger: I didn't hear you,
and you're my front man.

1460
01:54:37,162 --> 01:54:38,279
Man: No way!

1461
01:54:38,279 --> 01:54:40,580
Ginger: Yes, it's so true.

1462
01:54:41,149 --> 01:54:45,085
So I'm alone, and homeless, and
I think what I need to do is

1463
01:54:45,085 --> 01:54:48,088
find a nice, young man to take
me in and make me his wife.

1464
01:54:48,088 --> 01:54:49,189
What do you think?

1465
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:52,392
All right, let's go man hunting.

1466
01:54:52,793 --> 01:54:53,794
Hi, what's your name?

1467
01:54:53,794 --> 01:54:54,734
Tyler: Tyler.

1468
01:54:54,734 --> 01:54:56,997
Ginger: Tyler, I like you.
I'll come back to you.

1469
01:54:56,997 --> 01:54:57,899
And you?

1470
01:54:57,899 --> 01:54:59,100
Jay: Jay.

1471
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,501
Ginger: Did you see that?

1472
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:03,203
I'm going to leave him for you, okay?

1473
01:55:03,303 --> 01:55:05,405
I don't know.

1474
01:55:09,588 --> 01:55:10,502
Hello

1475
01:55:10,502 --> 01:55:11,256
Man 1: Hello.

1476
01:55:11,256 --> 01:55:13,115
I'm going to need your help
on this one, is that okay?

1477
01:55:13,115 --> 01:55:14,607
Man 1: Yes.
Ginger: I've got one, guys.

1478
01:55:14,715 --> 01:55:16,809
All right. Stand right here.

1479
01:55:17,217 --> 01:55:20,621
There's a little too much stuff.

1480
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:23,623
We're going to remove
this item of clothing.

1481
01:55:24,225 --> 01:55:26,328
Woo, that's much better.

1482
01:55:26,328 --> 01:55:28,228
We like what we see, don't we guys?

1483
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,131
All right.

1484
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:32,533
Man 1: I'm so pleased to meet you.

1485
01:55:32,533 --> 01:55:34,435
Ginger: You're a lot more
than that, don't worry.

1486
01:55:34,636 --> 01:55:37,939
So I think
but I'm getting a little hasty.

1487
01:55:37,939 --> 01:55:40,640
I shouldn't just choose
the first man I see, right?

1488
01:55:40,741 --> 01:55:41,843
Audience: No way.

1489
01:55:41,843 --> 01:55:42,945
Ginger: So I probably need to

1490
01:55:42,945 --> 01:55:47,347
have a competition, for my love.

1491
01:55:47,448 --> 01:55:48,949
Because love is important, isn't it?

1492
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:50,151
Do you feel me?

1493
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:52,052
Love is really important.

1494
01:55:52,052 --> 01:55:57,052
So we need two more, two
more guys to pick from.

1495
01:55:58,759 --> 01:56:00,160
Hi.

1496
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:03,063
You, come stand up here.

1497
01:56:03,564 --> 01:56:05,265
You are number two.

1498
01:56:05,966 --> 01:56:08,868
And, hrm.

1499
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:10,771
How are you?

1500
01:56:10,872 --> 01:56:11,772
Man 3: Fine.

1501
01:56:11,772 --> 01:56:12,572
Ginger: Good.

1502
01:56:12,572 --> 01:56:14,974
You look scared of me, I don't know.

1503
01:56:15,175 --> 01:56:17,578
Here for my love. Are you scared?

1504
01:56:17,578 --> 01:56:18,880
Man 3: A little bit.

1505
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,679
Ginger: A little scared?

1506
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:21,181
Like on a scale of one
to 10 you're like a ...

1507
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:22,583
Man 3: scared.

1508
01:56:22,583 --> 01:56:23,485
Ginger: That will do.

1509
01:56:23,485 --> 01:56:25,285
Okay, get up here.

1510
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:28,388
We're going to put on some
music, we're going to dance,

1511
01:56:28,388 --> 01:56:29,690
and then you're going to help me pick one.

1512
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:30,691
What do you think about that?

1513
01:56:31,993 --> 01:56:34,995
All right guys, time
to get your groove on.

1514
01:56:35,297 --> 01:56:37,397
Guy number one, let's see what you've got.

1515
01:56:39,299 --> 01:56:41,002
He's brushing the shoulders.

1516
01:56:41,002 --> 01:56:43,403
Doing the surfer, doing the surfer.

1517
01:56:43,403 --> 01:56:45,206
What else do you got? Give me one more.

1518
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:47,608
Oh that's going to be hard to beat.

1519
01:56:47,608 --> 01:56:49,310
Guy number two, what do you got?

1520
01:56:51,371 --> 01:56:53,314
Oh, he's got the hips.

1521
01:56:54,014 --> 01:56:55,716
Got the funky groove.

1522
01:56:55,916 --> 01:56:58,619
Show me something else,
show me something else.

1523
01:56:58,819 --> 01:57:00,320
Some little snake arms.

1524
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:03,124
I like that, I could do that
for the rest of eternity.

1525
01:57:03,124 --> 01:57:05,218
What about you, what have
you got, guy number three?

1526
01:57:07,001 --> 01:57:10,931
Oh, he's in a club. He's clubbing.

1527
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:15,335
I think he's still a little
scared. Break out of it.

1528
01:57:15,535 --> 01:57:18,238
Oh, there it is. Backing
it up, backing it up.

1529
01:57:18,338 --> 01:57:20,041
What about you, what have you got?

1530
01:57:20,733 --> 01:57:23,343
Oh, she's sexy. We like her.

1531
01:57:23,544 --> 01:57:25,345
What about you? Show me something good.

1532
01:57:25,746 --> 01:57:27,847
Give me a little hip bump
out here in the audience?

1533
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:33,753
I think he's still a little
scared. Break out of it.

1534
01:57:34,055 --> 01:57:36,857
Oh, there it is. Backing
it up, backing it up.

1535
01:57:37,358 --> 01:57:38,958
What about you, what have you got?

1536
01:57:39,459 --> 01:57:41,962
Oh, she's sexy. We like her.

1537
01:57:41,962 --> 01:57:43,763
What about you? Show me something good.

1538
01:57:45,165 --> 01:57:47,568
Give me a little hip bump
out here in the audience?

1539
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:51,271
Yes, well done. Come on.

1540
01:57:52,072 --> 01:57:53,775
Yes, well done.

1541
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:55,875
Come on, you know you like it.

1542
01:57:56,376 --> 01:57:57,878
Everyone all together.

1543
01:57:57,878 --> 01:58:00,910
Dancing with our hips. I
know you've all got hips.

1544
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:02,257
There you go.

1545
01:58:02,965 --> 01:58:04,684
Yeah, pump it up.

1546
01:58:05,687 --> 01:58:06,787
All right, guys.

1547
01:58:06,787 --> 01:58:10,992
Five, four, three, two, one.

1548
01:58:11,091 --> 01:58:14,094
Give me a big round of applause
for these guys right here.

1549
01:58:17,765 --> 01:58:19,900
By a show of hands, who thinks guy

1550
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:22,111
number three should be my husband?

1551
01:58:23,334 --> 01:58:25,606
Woo, that was pretty good. We like you.

1552
01:58:25,706 --> 01:58:27,108
By a show of hands, who thinks guy

1553
01:58:27,108 --> 01:58:29,309
number two should be my husband?

1554
01:58:31,474 --> 01:58:33,113
They like you, don't worry.

1555
01:58:33,113 --> 01:58:34,743
You're very good.

1556
01:58:34,743 --> 01:58:36,078
Let me help you with that.

1557
01:58:36,078 --> 01:58:37,979
Guy 2: Ah, thank you.

1558
01:58:38,518 --> 01:58:39,621
Ginger: All right. By a show of hands,

1559
01:58:39,621 --> 01:58:42,123
who thinks guy number
one should be my husband?

1560
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:46,126
We have a big winner.

1561
01:58:46,126 --> 01:58:48,828
Sorry guys, you were
very lovely to play with.

1562
01:58:48,929 --> 01:58:51,232
Why don't you come keep
this lady company over here.

1563
01:58:56,163 --> 01:58:57,638
I am all yours, what's your name?

1564
01:58:57,638 --> 01:58:58,839
Mike: Hey, I'm Mike.

1565
01:58:58,839 --> 01:59:01,041
Ginger: He's right. That's very good.

1566
01:59:01,042 --> 01:59:03,443
So Mike, if we're going to
be together for the rest of

1567
01:59:03,443 --> 01:59:06,299
eternity I think we need to
do one more test of trust.

1568
01:59:06,299 --> 01:59:07,648
What do you guys think?

1569
01:59:08,949 --> 01:59:10,451
All right, can you do that for me, Mike?

1570
01:59:10,452 --> 01:59:11,351
Mike: Absolutely.

1571
01:59:11,351 --> 01:59:12,390
Ginger: Awesome, all right.

1572
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:14,354
I'm going to need you
to lay down right here.

1573
01:59:15,147 --> 01:59:17,457
Right on the ground in
front of these nice people.

1574
01:59:18,058 --> 01:59:19,159
Are you comfy?

1575
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:19,960
Mike: No.

1576
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,561
Ginger: No? That's okay.

1577
01:59:21,663 --> 01:59:23,364
I need you to cover this with your eyes,

1578
01:59:23,364 --> 01:59:24,565
you're not going to want to see this,

1579
01:59:24,565 --> 01:59:26,566
and maybe, you know.

1580
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:30,371
Here's what's going to happen.

1581
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:35,371
I am going to jump over
Mike on my skateboard.

1582
01:59:37,277 --> 01:59:38,578
What do you guys think?

1583
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:41,582
This is very difficult.

1584
01:59:41,582 --> 01:59:43,783
It's never been done
before, at least not by me.

1585
01:59:44,285 --> 01:59:45,786
This is my first time.

1586
01:59:46,087 --> 01:59:47,225
Don't be worried.

1587
01:59:47,225 --> 01:59:48,289
Mike: I'm worried.

1588
01:59:48,289 --> 01:59:49,990
Ginger: It's going to be okay.

1589
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:52,092
Are you okay? Nod your head.

1590
01:59:52,292 --> 01:59:54,038
Yes, he's fine.

1591
01:59:55,714 --> 01:59:59,400
I just need to take a
little measurement here.

1592
02:00:02,606 --> 02:00:04,104
Yeah, that will do.

1593
02:00:04,805 --> 02:00:07,007
We have a couple inches
to spare, it's okay.

1594
02:00:09,014 --> 02:00:10,312
If this works, Mike and I are

1595
02:00:10,312 --> 02:00:12,613
getting married for all eternity.

1596
02:00:12,813 --> 02:00:14,516
And if not, it's going to be

1597
02:00:14,516 --> 02:00:16,116
a really short term relationship.

1598
02:00:16,116 --> 02:00:17,817
It's okay, Mike, I've got this.

1599
02:00:18,219 --> 02:00:20,351
I've only been doing this for one day.

1600
02:00:21,027 --> 02:00:23,123
Can I get a big round
of applause for Mike?

1601
02:00:25,125 --> 02:00:30,125
We're going to count down from
five, four, three, two, one.

1602
02:00:32,854 --> 02:00:34,234
And that's it.

1603
02:00:34,234 --> 02:00:36,937
All right, you are the love of my life.

1604
02:00:36,937 --> 02:00:38,339
Come to me.

1605
02:00:38,538 --> 02:00:39,940
Give me a big kiss.

1606
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:41,742
That's it for Mike.

1607
02:00:41,742 --> 02:00:43,043
Thank you guys so much.

1608
02:00:43,043 --> 02:00:45,946
If you enjoyed the show please
try to show me a little love.

1609
02:00:45,946 --> 02:00:47,849
My name is Ginger. Thank you.

1610
02:00:53,308 --> 02:00:55,455
Thank you, thank you so much.

1611
02:00:55,756 --> 02:00:56,956
Thank you.

1612
02:00:56,957 --> 02:00:58,959
Ladies, you're awesome, you're wonderful.

1613
02:00:59,561 --> 02:01:00,962
Thank you guys.

1614
02:01:04,575 --> 02:01:06,866
Darlene: You were really, really good.

1615
02:01:08,105 --> 02:01:11,773
I saw a whole new side of
you today, a whole new side.

1616
02:01:12,787 --> 02:01:17,787
Ginger: I think, maybe, you
just saw me for the first time.

1617
02:01:18,378 --> 02:01:19,980
Darlene: Maybe.

1618
02:01:20,782 --> 02:01:22,882
Preconceptions frequently get in the way.

1619
02:01:26,198 --> 02:01:28,389
Ginger: Mom, this is Chaos.

1620
02:01:28,389 --> 02:01:29,690
Darlene:.

1621
02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:30,591
Ginger: That is his name.

1622
02:01:30,591 --> 02:01:32,292
No preconceptions, remember?

1623
02:01:34,296 --> 02:01:37,297
Chaos, meet my mother.

1624
02:01:37,898 --> 02:01:39,199
Darlene: Nice to meet you.

1625
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:40,501
Chaos: Honored.

1626
02:01:44,103 --> 02:01:45,906
Ginger: I'm staying at
his place, by the way.

1627
02:01:45,906 --> 02:01:47,708
Darlene: Don't tell me. La-la-la-la.

1628
02:01:47,708 --> 02:01:49,910
Ginger: Yeah, you pretend
like you don't know.

1629
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:53,213
I found her and my wannabe fiance
in bed together last night.

1630
02:01:53,213 --> 02:01:54,366
Darlene: Oh for God's sakes,

1631
02:01:54,366 --> 02:01:55,916
don't be telling everyone.

1632
02:01:56,917 --> 02:01:58,319
Chaos: You've got a whole
secret world going on.

1633
02:01:58,319 --> 02:02:00,320
Ginger: No, it's her secret world.

1634
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:03,123
I just happened to grow up in it.

1635
02:02:03,363 --> 02:02:04,524
Darlene: I love you.

1636
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:09,229
Ginger: I love you.

1637
02:02:10,832 --> 02:02:12,433
Darlene: I'm very proud of you.

1638
02:02:17,123 --> 02:02:21,641
Ginger: We'll just let the
winds of time flow between us.
