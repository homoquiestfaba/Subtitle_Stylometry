<i>"Memory needs to be the path leading</i>
<i>not only to the past,</i>

2
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:15,779
but to the future as well."

3
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,139
Ana Blandiana

4
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:24,619
In 1951, the Communist government
of Romania ordered

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,420
the deportation of more
than 40,000 innocent people

6
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:30,100
who lived near the border
with Tito's Yugoslavia.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,660
Accused of being enemies of
the people, they were snatched

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,660
overnight from their houses,
loaded onto cattle trains

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,660
and thrown into the wilderness
of the Baragan fields

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,980
in conditions nearly impossible
to survive.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,940
They were all victims of a process
of eliminating political adversaries,

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,700
and ethnic cleansing
of the militarized border.

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,740
This movie is dedicated
to their memory.

14
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,459
based on the short novel
"Projects of The Past" by Ana Blandiana

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,539
Baragan fields, 1956

16
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,620
Emil, Emil... let's just tell
them we don't want to leave.

17
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,660
Why not? If that's what we want.

18
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,739
Want what?! Can't you see? It's over!

19
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,979
Our island is gone!

20
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,819
We're at their will again.

21
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,859
It was all an illusion!

22
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,180
"SO, WHAT'S FREEDOM?"

23
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,299
I always stood for truth,

24
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,419
searching for it, solving its mysteries.

25
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,180
I knew how to tell the difference
between fairy tale and reality,

26
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,460
between knowledge and ignorance.

27
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,299
I knew there couldn't be
any knowledge without truth,

28
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,900
and that we couldn't
call ourselves free without it.

29
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,579
As I realized fairly quickly,
in fact I knew nothing at all.

30
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,859
As the Red Army entered
the country,

31
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,100
Romania ended its alliance
with Germany.

32
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,419
The Soviet Union took its place.

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,220
Stalin promised a
brilliant future, a society

34
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,780
in which men didn't
exploit each other,

35
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,380
to be built hand in hand
by workers and philosophers,

36
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,579
teachers and peasants,

37
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,460
students and the military.

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,019
I was already married
to my college sweetheart,

39
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,060
Turica Iorga, who took
my last name and became

40
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,340
comrade teacher Dumitra Bazan.

41
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,460
We were both working
at the same school.

42
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,780
Today...

43
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,419
... freedom is our precious reward
for having fought so hard for a justice.

44
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,100
That's why it needs to be treated
very, very carefully...

45
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:25,379
Being free doesn't mean one can do
anything, anywhere, anyhow...

46
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:31,820
So, what's freedom?

47
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,900
- I'll expect your answers next time. Yes?
- Yes!

48
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,299
Turica taught French, and I history,
of course. We loved each other,

49
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:04,419
so the future seemed filled
with hope and aspirations.

50
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,539
Wait... wait.

51
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,220
Try a little more seduction...

52
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,780
C'mon, tell me more about Paris...

53
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,220
When everything calms down...

54
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,299
... fraternity,

55
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,340
freedom, equality!

56
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,939
We'll take Paris!

57
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,939
You promise?

58
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,619
I swear it.

59
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:14,660
Bazan!

60
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,939
Stroe worked for the Secret Police.

61
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,020
He was... how should I call him?
Our "Serviceman".

62
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,900
We didn't know anything about him,
but he knew everything about us.

63
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,739
Thank you.

64
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,499
The party has great plans for you.

65
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,059
- But, so do we.
- I'm so glad to hear that.

66
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,580
Of course, only if your wife
decided to finally help out...

67
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,539
What do you mean?

68
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,419
Russian is the language of the future.

69
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:45,660
French belongs in the past,
which we already buried.

70
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,059
Vigilence begins at home.

71
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,379
Stroe showed up in Herculane right after
travel abroad became strictly regulated

72
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,140
and controlled. All contacts with
the Western world were forbidden.

73
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,939
After Stalin expelled
Tito's Yugoslavia from the

74
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,660
International Organization
of Socialist Republics

75
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:16,619
the Serbs suddenly
became our biggest enemy.

76
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,499
The threat of war with
Yugoslavia grew day by day

77
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,059
Stroe was charged with protecting us.

78
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:34,020
Turica couldn't stand him.

79
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,220
Comrade Colonel Stroe
has been further delayed.

80
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,419
We must unmask our
enemies: the American and

81
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:10,619
English imperialists,
their lackeys, like Tito,

82
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,220
and many others, show the world
their true colors,

83
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,539
put them to death if necessary...

84
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,859
You're coming to Toplet tomorrow, right?
You're not teaching.

85
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,260
Does Emil know the wedding's
at a kulak's place?

86
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,979
Did the Party give him permission?

87
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:25,020
This is no joking matter, Yvonne.
Really...

88
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,340
Indeed.

89
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,100
You know my uncle, right?
They took him 2 days ago.

90
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,899
He owned 5 acres of
land, from his grandparents.

91
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,659
Wouldn't give them up to
the Party. And now look...

92
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,940
He got hard labor...

93
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,460
Maybe they hold him until
they solve the Serb issue

94
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,859
at the border, and then
they'll send him back home.

95
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,340
From deportation?

96
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,580
Nobody ever came back.

97
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,180
How can you take these
things so lightly, Turica?

98
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,300
I am still going to the wedding.

99
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,100
You?

100
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,859
Leaving.

101
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,060
Tonight. I'm crossing
the Danube to Yugoslavia.

102
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,220
You can't do that!

103
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,379
There must be another way, something...

104
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,859
I didn't find one.

105
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,139
Did you?

106
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,739
... everybody will
receive what they need,

107
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,499
and will work according
to their abilities.

108
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,139
This is the brilliant future of communism.

109
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,420
Bazan!

110
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,940
- Everything in order at school?
- All good.

111
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,779
I'm here about my travel request to Paris.

112
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,659
I hear your students like you a lot.

113
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,899
You challenge them
to think for themselves.

114
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,019
- Yes.
- Not bad.

115
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,739
Was going to Paris your wife's idea?

116
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,700
An old promise I made,
from our college days.

117
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:47,540
And who's idea was it to go to
Blajinu's wedding in Toplet?

118
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,379
- What's got into you?
- It's Radio France, currently forbidden!

119
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,619
You'll get us in trouble.
Is it hard to understand?

120
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,979
It's only music...

121
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,259
Don't worry, tomorrow there'll be
plenty of food in Toplet.

122
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,019
They're roasting up a whole pig, a veal,
baking a hundred pastries, eight cakes...

123
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,139
It'll be a fairy tale wedding, you'll see.

124
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,300
We're not going.

125
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,220
What? What are you talking about?

126
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,180
All the teachers were invited.
Ion is our colleague.

127
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,300
Emil?

128
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,540
I talked to Stroe today.

129
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,779
He's in charge of our travel request.

130
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,820
Once he approves it, nobody
will stop us anymore.

131
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,340
But you have to forget
about Blajinu's wedding.

132
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,820
It's Paris, or Toplet.

133
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,180
Your choice.

134
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,940
Village of Toplet
12 km. from Herculane

135
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,060
Hey!

136
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,019
Listen up, all of you!

137
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,379
Anyone brave enough,
come to the wedding!

138
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,700
The entire village is invited!

139
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,859
Did you hear me? I
dare all of you to come!

140
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,019
Listen, you fool!

141
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,739
Even if they sent me to Siberia...

142
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,019
...they couldn't stop Miron from throwing
his daughter the best wedding ever!

143
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
- Shut up! You'll get us in trouble again.
- Let me be, woman. Music!

144
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,499
<i>Yugoslavia is one of the founding</i>
<i>members of COMINFORM,</i>

145
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,220
<i>but its leader, Joseph Tito refuses</i>
<i>to follow orders sent by the Soviets.</i>

146
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
<i>The tensions between Tito and</i>
<i>the Soviet block have escalated.</i>

147
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,619
<i>Both Yugoslavia and</i>
<i>pro-Soviet Romania are</i>

in the Banat region.

150
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:13,899
Both governments ...

151
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,340
<i>Sources tell us that Romania</i>
<i>has restricted civilian traffic</i>

152
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,659

<i>and by Orsova, Toplet and</i>
<i>Herculane to the East.</i>

155
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,940
<i>Confrontation between Tito and Stalin's</i>
<i>allies could start at any moment.</i>

156
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:51,940
Here is Radio France!

157
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,899
- Hello.
- Hello.

158
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:15,580
Nothing yet?

159
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,220
I'm scared, Grandma...

160
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,859
How long can love last?

161
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,859
Why don't you let God
worry about tomorrow?

162
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,420
Live in the moment! Enjoy it!

163
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,100
Wait... that's to pay off
any evil, send it away...

164
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Thank you, God bless.

165
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,460
Made my choice. I'll be back tomorrow.

166
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,739
No further than Toplet.

167
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,580
Comrade Bazan!.... Good day to you.

168
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,459
I have a letter for your wife. I think
she's been expecting it for some time.

169
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,859
You should read it first.
You never know these days.

170
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:40,100
But it's open.

171
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,500
How else? It's from abroad...

172
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,379
Careful with that, I'd say... Yes?

173
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,899
Hurry up!

174
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,939
Go sit down!

175
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,859
- You know him?
- No.

176
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,580
Rich landowners live here

177
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
Hey, you fool!... Crazy guy!

178
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,379
- How're the women in there?
- There's no more time...

179
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:23,859
- What?
- Time, time! There's no more time...

180
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,740
Well...

181
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Well what?

182
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,219
Listen, Ion! Ana is my only one.
Understand?

183
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,100
I've cared for her like
the eyes in my head!

184
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,699
You have no idea

185
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,740
how many pregnant girls the Russians
and Germans left behind.

186
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,619
Difficult times are coming.

187
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,659
Take good care of her. You hear me?

188
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,899
Ana!

189
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,340
- Welcome!
- Great to see you!

190
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:31,340
- Congratulations! So happy for you!
- Thank you!

191
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,699
- I'm so glad you made it!
- He wouldn't miss it!

192
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,300
- Welcome!
- That's her.

193
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:36,580
- Hi! Turica.
- Ana.

194
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,300
- Pleased to meet you.
- You , too.

195
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:42,139
Ion has told me so much
about you and the school.

196
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,179
We're planning on moving
to Herculane, as well.

197
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,379
- When?
- After the wedding.

198
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:46,459
- Right away?
- Yes.

199
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,300
- What are your plans there?
- Go to nursing school, God willing.

200
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,459
Very well.

201
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,379
Mom, you can't do that.
It's the bride's apple!

202
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:56,219
- Emil! Let's go.
- Please, make yourselves at home.

203
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,580
Keep it up!

204
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:05,899
- Has anyone else come from the school?
- No.

205
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,260
It's probably this whole
situation with the Serbs...

206
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,379
What situation, Emil?

207
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,179
A wedding's a wedding!

208
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,580
What does a wedding
have to do with politics?

209
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:16,540
They didn't come
because... they're cowards.

210
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,980
How come you two made it?

211
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:06,619
Did I ever tell you?

212
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,619
After our first dance together
I tried to imagine...

213
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,980
what it'd be like to still
dance with you at 50...

214
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,980
That's when I knew I wanted
to marry you.

215
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,139
You're handsome when you smile.

216
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,060
Let's dance.

217
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,899
C'mon!

218
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,619
Come on!

219
00:23:58,699 --> 00:23:59,780
Down with landowners!

220
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,459
Fire one off, soldier!

221
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,899
What a big man you are Marin
when the army is behind you!

222
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,899
Silence!

223
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:15,100
Silence, and in the name of the law...

224
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,859
pay attention to Mister...
I mean our Comrade here!

225
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,939
According to the Romanian
People's Republic's

226
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,939
Council of Ministers' decree
number 200 from 1950,

227
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:39,939
supplemented by decree
number 344 from March 15th. 1951,

228
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,580
and by the ruling of our
State Security Services,

229
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,379
all present here are
subject to immediate,

230
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:49,859
mandatory evacuation
and relocation

231
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,859
to an assigned residence,
as they are enemies

232
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:56,659
who have jeopardized
the People's Democratic Regime.

233
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,820
The evacuation will commence 2 hours
from the reading of this decree,

234
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:05,780
under the supervision of the State
Security and of the Ministry of Interior,

235
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:08,100
in the presence of the local authorities.

236
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,980
Is that clear?

237
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,740
Comrade Sargent, I live a short
ways away, at the railway crossing.

238
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,419
My shift starts in less than an hour.

239
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,379
What, didn't you hear me?

240
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:20,260
Start packing, now!

241
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,939
I'm comrade Bazan, history teacher
in Herculane, with my wife.

242
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,139
- We're about to leave. Do your job.
- Nobody leaves. You're all under arrest.

243
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,020
There's been a mistake.

244
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,580
Call Herculane. Comrade Stroe, at the
Ministry of Interior. He can vouch for us.

245
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:41,100
A mistake? You mean to say that
our Party makes mistakes?

246
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,699
Would you look at him?

247
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,340
He's under arrest, and continues
to speak against the Party.

248
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:50,780
Get on your knees!... On your knees!...
Right now!

249
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:53,500
I should shoot you just for saying that!

250
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,659
Filthy landowner!

251
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,500
Everyone, pack your bags!

252
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,020
That means everyone.

253
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,340
You have two hours!

254
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,659
Thieves!

255
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,540
C'mon! Move!

256
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:46,580
What's with that music?

257
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,419
Move!

258
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
It's my right! You gave it to me!

259
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,899
To hell with you and your people!

260
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,419
Fucking German! You want wood?
Here, build yourself a coffin!

261
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,179
You'll need it where you're headed.

262
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,980
Get out of here, damned Nazi!

263
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,820
Don't run! Come here!

264
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,219
- Where's my father?
- You'll find him where you're going.

265
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,379
Don't kill her!

266
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,300
Kill me instead!

267
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,899
Not Ilinca!

268
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:42,419
Let her go!

269
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,419
Let her go!

270
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,219
It's alright, Father

271
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,219
Mom...

272
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,340
He doesn't feel well.

273
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:51,820
- To Siberia?
- How are you?

274
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,379
Oh, dear Jesus!

275
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,300
I bet they're taking
us straight to Siberia.

276
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,939
I can't breathe, Granny. Move over.

277
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:17,300
Does anyone have water?

278
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:19,260
I've got some, Maria.

279
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,459
<i>- Ancsi!... Ancsi!</i>
<i>- Come back here!</i>

280
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,859
Is it yours?

281
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,980
<i>- Ancsi!</i>
<i>- Come back now!</i>

282
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,659
Mine is Ana.

283
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,939
Ancsi, come back here!

284
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,379
Did you marry him?

285
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:48,699
Ancsi...

286
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,899
They warned me. Didn't they?

287
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,580
And what did I do?

288
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:34,419
How could I let her go alone, when
the political situation is what it is?

289
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,020
I'll figure it out , don't worry.

290
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,100
We'll be back home in no time.

291
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,980
We have to teach tomorrow, don't we?

292
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,419
What the hell did I say now?

293
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,819
Lock on target!

294
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,299
At my order...

295
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,699
Open it!

296
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,179
- Cosasu Sabina
- Here.

297
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,540
- Fidel Jonas!
- Here.

298
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,819
- Berca Eugen!
- Here.

299
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,380
Simion Sofia!

300
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,100
I'm comrade Emil Bazan.
There's been a mix-up...

301
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,179
- Simion Vasile!
- Yes.

302
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,100
- Bazan Dumitra!
- Here.

303
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,259
- Bazan Emil!
- Here.

304
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,500
- Ornea Isaac!
- Yes.

305
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,980
- Ornea Esther!
- Yes.

306
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:55,299
Do you wanna play, kitty?

307
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:00,179
- Bercu Iolanda!
- Here.

308
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,900
- Morosan Floarea!
- Yes.

309
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,219
Let's go!

310
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,259
Ancsi!

311
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,420
Don't run!

312
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,819
- Ancsi, don't run!
- Stop right there, or I'll shoot!

313
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,020
Come back here!

314
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,020
Ancsi!

315
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,540
He's not breathing, comrade!

316
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,779
- And the child?
- It took them both out.

317
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,219
You, damned rich bitch!

318
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,259
Why did he have to run?

319
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:34,179
To make me kill a child? Huh?!

320
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:35,179
Tell me!

321
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:42,460
Get them out of my sight!
Into the trucks!

322
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,179
That's an order!

323
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,940
- Where are you taking us?
- Move!

324
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,100
- Keep moving, don't you hear?
- Don't push her!

325
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,380
- Ion!
- Ana!

326
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Move! Move! Go!

327
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,500
- Ion, don't leave me!
- Ana!

328
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
- Ion!
- Ana!

329
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,659
Ready this one! Go!

330
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,500
- Ion, don't leave me!
- Ana!

331
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,219
Ready this one!

332
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,900
- Hop in! Go!
- Ion!

333
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:26,420
Ion, don't leave me!... Ion!

334
00:38:57,139 --> 00:38:58,779
Comrade soldier, please stop this truck!

335
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,540
My wife and I don't
belong with these people.

336
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:02,100
Why did I fight in the
Resistance, just to...

337
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:05,619
You, communist pig!

338
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,500
You're welcome.

339
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:33,659
The Baragan fields

340
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,020
The Ministry of Interior
of Romania hereby

341
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,020
decrees the mandatory
removal and relocation

342
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,860
of all enemies of the
Romanian Workers

343
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,819
Party, the Soviet
Union, and their leaders.

344
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:45,500
Leaving the area within a 15 kilometer
radius, as well as contact with outsiders

345
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,299
without prior authorization
are strictly forbidden.

346
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,460
Is it clear?

347
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,860
Wait! When are the others coming?

348
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,060
Where are they?

349
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,380
Where are the others?!

350
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,860
We have to make a fire.

351
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:45,380
For the night.

352
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:47,500
And a shelter, too.

353
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,259
They just left and Fritz is
the one giving orders now?

354
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,060
Make them yourself, if you are cold.

355
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,900
Get going! What are you staring at?

356
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,139
We leave tomorrow morning.

357
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,940
The man said 15 km.

358
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,060
That means there might be
some villages 20 km. away.

359
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:49,580
We'll sort it out there.

360
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,219
You can go. I'm not coming.

361
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:59,619
And I won't be waiting for you.
I'm tired of waiting.

362
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:01,420
Wanna know how long?

363
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,699
Since they got you to start following
them blindly, wherever they wanted.

364
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:09,259
You never said no,
and you forgot about us.

365
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:14,179
And since they started thinking for you,
and all you did was cheer them on.

366
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:15,900
What's left to do?

367
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,659
Don't you get it? This is our Siberia.

368
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,779
It's over!

369
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,299
Has anyone seen my husband?

370
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,779
Hey, who took my bicycle?

371
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,139
Are you all deaf?

372
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:42,980
Bazan!

373
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,339
Here, Bazan!

374
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:54,900
Where to, Bazan? Paris?

375
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,619
Please, leave me alone! I did everything
you asked of me. Where did I go wrong?

376
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:01,100
Maybe you'll learn to toe the line!

377
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,259
You have one friend left: Baragan!

378
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:08,540
It's a... it's a
mistake... It has to be...

379
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:12,619
- Make sure you don't lose it, too!
- But it's a mistake... There's no way...

380
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,100
Take a sip, Father.

381
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:20,500
Are there any priests left
who are good for anything?

382
00:50:21,299 --> 00:50:23,020
The German's right.

383
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,500
God sent us here and forgot about us.

384
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,020
And we've forgotten who we are.

385
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,420
Dear God...

386
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:37,179
If you only knew how much I prayed
for Him to take me. To set me free...

387
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:41,139
Jonas, who are you to judge?
You think you're better than us?

388
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:44,619
That's why your wife left you? At 40
years old, all alone, and with no kids...

389
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:47,659
Not your business! Only my business!

390
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:50,819
We all have sinned...

391
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:36,460
Do you think you'll see
your husband again?

392
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,659
I'm sure I'll never see mine again.

393
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:43,139
What's up, Fritz?

394
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:44,699
Come with me!

395
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,940
Coming.

396
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:53,339
Ion came to our village 3 years ago.

397
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:00,739
With the literacy task force.
Knocked me off my feet.

398
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:06,699
I haven't stop falling since then.

399
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,739
You know what I really regret?...
I am sorry that...

400
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:17,860
I'm sorry I didn't let
him do it... You know?

401
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,860
I insisted on marrying him a virgin.

402
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,819
I think you did the right thing.

403
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:07,580
Help!

404
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,139
Here!

405
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:30,380
See those stars up there in a W shape?
... That's "the hen with the chicks".

406
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,739
As long as they're shining,
we're good. It's autumn.

407
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:39,060
When you see a triangle of lights lower
to the left, that means winter's coming.

408
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:43,299
That means certain death.

409
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,500
You freeze.

410
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,020
Why didn't you leave with your husband?

411
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,540
- What did you say your name was?
- Culai... And yours?

412
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:54,779
Drink, Father.

413
00:55:56,339 --> 00:55:59,020
- Then, why are so calm, Culai?
- Well...

414
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,420
Well what?

415
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,779
<i>School of Arts and Literature</i>
<i>at the University of Paris</i>

416
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,580
During the war I saw so
much death, eventually

417
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:49,860
it started to feel like
I was slowly dying.

418
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,500
I deserted.

419
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:56,259
The dead with the dead,
the living with the living.

420
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,500
Let them go...

421
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:05,659
You have to let them go their way.

422
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:48,900
Ana, Turica!

423
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,659
Look, look over the hill! Your men!

424
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,860
I don't know what to tell
you, but look! It's them!

425
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,580
Why did you come back?

426
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,259
What, did they pay you
to come back and bury us?

427
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:24,460
We'd rather freeze to death here,
than be killed by your kind.

428
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,860
- Where did you find Ion?
- In the fields.

429
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,020
And you brought him here for
the secret police to come after him?

430
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,900
He's right. As soon as
they make the connection,

431
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,179
they'll be looking for him
here. We'll all be punished.

432
01:00:33,259 --> 01:00:36,779
- We have to turn Ion in!
- Stop it! Stop it!

433
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:41,420
Stop it!

434
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:47,500
You, fucking Secret Policeman!

435
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,339
Cups, bowls... a picture,
put it there...

436
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:42,100
one samovar

437
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,139
A lamp...

438
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:47,580
A letter for you from France.

439
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,299
Scissors...

440
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,739
<i>It would be an honor to have</i>
<i>you here as soon as possible,</i>

441
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,779
...a trunk...

442
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:06,259
...as a guest teacher at the Sorbonne.

443
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:13,259
...a balance...

444
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,020
What were you afraid
would happen if you told me?

445
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,659
I'm sure Stroe knew about it.

446
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:41,940
Calm down, calm down. He wouldn't
have cleared us for travel anyway.

447
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:53,179
It'll be alright.

448
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,339
You'll see.

449
01:04:57,179 --> 01:05:00,779
If we do what they say,
we'll be out of here soon.

450
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:06,659
For fuck's sake, Tristan
Tzara is a communist.

451
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:11,020
We'll get to him.

452
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:16,900
I want my life back.

453
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,100
Can you give me that?

454
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:24,100
Can you?

455
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:46,179
We have to ration our supplies.

456
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:51,659
As long as we still have
milk, we won't die of hunger.

457
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:55,219
But we need to work carefully
on gathering seeds for the spring.

458
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:58,339
What do you mean spring?

459
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:04,580
<i>- You mean our baby will be born here?</i>
<i>- Only if we can make it through winter.</i>

460
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:08,339
We could've tried to run away,
but there was nowhere to run.

461
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,259
We were on an island...

462
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:14,500
stuck between a confusing
past and an uncertain future,

463
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,940
victims of our lives' wreckage.

464
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:23,860
Here, it was up to us
wether we lived or died.

465
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:27,980
At least we were left the
freedom to make that choice.

466
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,860
There is an accent here.

467
01:06:54,819 --> 01:06:57,100
<i>- My name is...</i>
<i>- And an apostrophy here...</i>

468
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,900
And missing another letter here.

469
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,060
<i>- My nEme is...</i>
<i>- No. My name is.</i>

470
01:07:02,139 --> 01:07:03,219
My name is.

471
01:07:03,299 --> 01:07:05,139
Yeah... good.

472
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,740
You think this is how
you seduce a woman?

473
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:47,259
Well...

474
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,100
No?

475
01:09:55,179 --> 01:09:56,459
I love you.

476
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,740
I love you.

477
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,620
I love you.

478
01:10:13,259 --> 01:10:16,660
Dear Lord, our Father... It's been
a while since I lost track of You.

479
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:21,499
If You were the one who
decided to give me a family again...

480
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,100
...this time, please,

481
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,579
do not take it away from me.

482
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,219
From your Papa.

483
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,339
Thank you.

484
01:11:14,419 --> 01:11:20,980
His servant Ioan I betroth to His servant
Ana, in the name of the Father, the Son,

485
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:25,459
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

486
01:11:29,379 --> 01:11:35,179
His servant Ana I betroth to His servant
Ion, in the name of the Father, the Son,

487
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:37,539
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

488
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:48,700
Godparents, exchange rings.

489
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,419
We have company.

490
01:12:26,179 --> 01:12:28,139
- Hurry up!
- C'mon!

491
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:05,900
In formaaa-tion!

492
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,579
Name!

493
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:28,579
Jonas Friedl.

494
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:31,339
Dumitra Bazan.

495
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:33,579
Niculae Ifrim.

496
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:35,259
Emil Bazan

497
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,459
Father Nicodim Enache

498
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,940
Ileana Saculean

499
01:13:41,299 --> 01:13:42,499
Agnes Ferencz

500
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,259
Ana Saculean

501
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:51,700
What about Ion Blajinu?

502
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,940
Where is he?

503
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,539
You didn't hear my question?

504
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,259
I haven't seen him.

505
01:14:06,419 --> 01:14:08,100
Since you took him away from me.

506
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,700
Where is he?

507
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:11,579
Bourgeois bitch!

508
01:14:16,259 --> 01:14:19,860
Looks like you've built
yourselves a little hotel out here.

509
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:38,820
Prove to me the Party
was mistaken about you.

510
01:14:40,299 --> 01:14:45,139
Tell me where Ion Blajinu is,
and you and your wife can go home.

511
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,860
Right now.

512
01:14:48,339 --> 01:14:50,339
You'll be home tomorrow.

513
01:15:07,179 --> 01:15:08,579
I don't know where he is.

514
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,139
Murderer...

515
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,539
Murderer...

516
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,219
Murderer... murderer!

517
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,700
Murderer!

518
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:38,419
Murderer!

519
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:40,219
Careful now!

520
01:15:40,299 --> 01:15:45,579
Murderer! Murderer!

521
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,060
You didn't see him, right?!

522
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:14,780
Fucking asshole teacher!

523
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:19,419
You think you can fool me? You think
you're so smart? You piece of shit!

524
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,219
Ion, I can't feel the baby anymore.

525
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:18,139
He's here, but he might be hungry, too.

526
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:26,379
Turica!

527
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,219
I'm done!

528
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,620
Even my brain is frozen,
and so's all your French in it.

529
01:17:46,299 --> 01:17:48,579
Wait!
There's something left, though.

530
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,419
I'm hengry...

531
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,539
I'm hungry...

532
01:17:52,259 --> 01:17:53,179
I'm hangry...

533
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,060
<i>- I'm...</i>
<i>- I'm...</i>

534
01:17:55,139 --> 01:17:56,139
<i>- Hungry...</i>
<i>- Hongry...</i>

535
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:57,299
<i>- Hungry...</i>
<i>- Hungry...</i>

536
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,339
I'm so hungry, I'd eat this
wood if it weren't so frozen.

537
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:46,100
- Are you ok? I was afraid that...
- That what?

538
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,179
I love you.

539
01:18:57,139 --> 01:18:58,980
Why don't we start over?

540
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,259
We could have a life we want here.

541
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:08,900
Here?

542
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,179
Today, we finally eat!

543
01:19:36,259 --> 01:19:37,459
Today is Christmas.

544
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,940
- Is it meat?
- It's a surprise.

545
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,459
It's a secret... until tonight.

546
01:19:41,539 --> 01:19:43,700
He caught something... maybe a rabbit.

547
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,900
- God provided!
- Maybe two!

548
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,020
It's a surprise... it's a secret...
until tonight... until tonight.

549
01:19:49,539 --> 01:19:50,900
What if I die before tonight?

550
01:20:09,379 --> 01:20:15,660
Dear God, bring light into the hearts
of our enemies harming us,

551
01:20:17,339 --> 01:20:24,100
and make them good, and fill them
with love so that we can live in peace

552
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:32,020
and forgive our sins, as we forgive
those who sin against us.

553
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:38,179
In the name of the Father, of the
Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen!

554
01:20:39,299 --> 01:20:40,219
Amen!

555
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:48,179
We'll split it, so that there's
enough for everybody.

556
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:02,780
Lay down.

557
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,780
Easy...

558
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,100
- Don't go.
- Just a moment. Wait.

559
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:13,820
Please Ion, don't go.

560
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:14,940
Father...

561
01:22:15,419 --> 01:22:17,419
May God forgive me for
what I am about to say,

562
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,539
but if He gave us a child, why doesn't
He give us anything to feed him?

563
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,060
One rabbit won't see us through
to spring.

564
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,579
There's a gypsy village
about 20 km. from here.

565
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,860
No one dared mess with them.

566
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,740
Not before, and not the communists now.

567
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:51,660
With some money, we
could buy whatever from them.

568
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,339
Why didn't you say anything until now?

569
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,700
Well...

570
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,499
Here's Fundata, where
the train dropped us off.

571
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:03,900
We are here.

572
01:23:05,339 --> 01:23:07,860
The Gypsy village is
somewhere around here.

573
01:23:09,139 --> 01:23:11,459
It might take me 7 or 8 hours of walking.

574
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,499
I'll be back in 2 or 3 days.

575
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,060
But...

576
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,539
What happens if the
Secret Police catches you?

577
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,980
I know my way around, Father.

578
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:28,379
I worked on the railroad here.

579
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:32,100
Let's see how much
money we can pull together.

580
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:34,419
I'm coming with you.

581
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,139
Let's go!

582
01:24:38,299 --> 01:24:40,579
What are you still looking for, Bazan?

583
01:25:12,459 --> 01:25:13,419
Bazan!

584
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,020
Give Culai up, and maybe
we'll give you a second chance.

585
01:25:19,299 --> 01:25:21,620
C'mon, professor! Hurry up!

586
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:33,060
You're after my wife!

587
01:25:35,499 --> 01:25:36,980
I'm talking to you!

588
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,579
You'd better shut up and walk.

589
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:44,780
Go away!

590
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:02,299
Father...

591
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:04,780
I want to confess.

592
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,139
Professor!

593
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:23,700
Professor, come eat!

594
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,700
Five minute break to eat.

595
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:35,060
Eat!

596
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,459
You're trying to poison me!

597
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,780
What business did you have at
a landowner's wedding, you snitch?

598
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,740
Tell me! What do you
know about us? Tell me...

599
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:23,740
What do you want from me?!

600
01:28:27,179 --> 01:28:29,100
There's something in him.

601
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,620
Or maybe there's nothing...

602
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,499
Maybe it's just me.

603
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,980
It's all in my head.

604
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,259
But deep in my soul I believe I can...

605
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:50,740
...I can help him be a better man.

606
01:28:55,499 --> 01:28:58,020
It helps me make sense of myself...

607
01:28:58,579 --> 01:29:00,499
...in this wilderness.

608
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,259
It's what keeps me going.

609
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,620
I don't know if this is love, Father...

610
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,499
or it's just my survival instinct.

611
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,339
But it feels like if he were gone...

612
01:29:27,219 --> 01:29:30,780
...I wouldn't have a reason
to wake up in the morning.

613
01:29:38,379 --> 01:29:40,820
I'm afraid what I'm feeling is a sin...

614
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:47,820
... and that maybe I need
God's forgivness so that

615
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,139
nothing bad happens to him...

616
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,700
...and they can make it back safely.

617
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,660
Turica!

618
01:30:00,139 --> 01:30:01,060
We need you!

619
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,820
When I deserted from
the army in '41, I hid here.

620
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,860
In this shack.

621
01:31:29,299 --> 01:31:31,379
It's almost like I'm at home here...

622
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:36,060
This place has gone to hell,
too, just like everything else.

623
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,780
Then why are you staying with us?

624
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:43,740
You think these guys are like the ones
I was running away from in '41?

625
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:45,940
They have eyes and
ears everywhere, dammit.

626
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,860
They're something else.

627
01:31:49,499 --> 01:31:51,179
I'd get worse now than before.

628
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,179
Let's move.

629
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:16,740
Emil!

630
01:32:18,539 --> 01:32:19,900
Emil, help !

631
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,020
Emil!

632
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:27,219
Bazan! Bazan! Here, Bazan!

633
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:31,980
Where are you,
fucking communist asshole?!

634
01:32:49,379 --> 01:32:50,620
Where the fuck are you?

635
01:32:57,499 --> 01:32:58,740
Help me, Emil!

636
01:33:04,339 --> 01:33:05,259
Take him out, Bazan!

637
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:10,940
Now!

638
01:33:31,299 --> 01:33:35,179
He said two or three days. They
just left! What do you want from me?

639
01:33:35,259 --> 01:33:36,259
Listen, Fritz!

640
01:33:36,339 --> 01:33:39,179
Don't you get it? A woman
doesn't need this to know things.

641
01:33:39,259 --> 01:33:40,499
She only needs this!

642
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,660
I'll leave at dawn.

643
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,660
We're leaving now.

644
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,379
I think it's broken.

645
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,980
C'mon, Jonas! Hurry up!

646
01:34:11,299 --> 01:34:14,780
Wait up!
We're going together, aren't we?!

647
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:17,299
- There's no time to waste!
- Do you know the way?

648
01:34:17,379 --> 01:34:18,459
Yes!

649
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:21,219
That's not right!
We need to head North!

650
01:34:21,299 --> 01:34:22,579
C'mon! Walk!

651
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,339
You'll get us lost, Agnes!

652
01:34:25,419 --> 01:34:27,100
Don't be stubborn. Follow me!

653
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:34,020
We need to go West.

654
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,820
Jump!

655
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,820
Anyone knows where we're going?

656
01:34:42,499 --> 01:34:45,579
<i>Not even the Secret</i>
<i>Police will find us here!</i>

657
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,459
I'm sorry about Turica...

658
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:57,259
But it's not my fault that
you two are having problems.

659
01:34:57,339 --> 01:34:58,620
You'd better shut up.

660
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:16,780
- This path doesn't lead anywhere.
- Have you ever trusted a woman?

661
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,780
What a question!

662
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:46,700
We're wasting our time.

663
01:35:48,219 --> 01:35:49,459
We'll never find them.

664
01:35:50,259 --> 01:35:52,179
They've surely reached the village.

665
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:55,259
You go back and tell that to Turica.

666
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,419
I can do it alone.

667
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:06,660
Jonas!

668
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:09,940
Jonas!

669
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,179
Jonas?!

670
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:13,740
Jonas!

671
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:15,860
Jonas...

672
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,100
Alone?

673
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:20,579
Come spring, I'm leaving.

674
01:39:24,139 --> 01:39:25,459
I'm taking you with me.

675
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:41,060
- Good morning.
- God bless.

676
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:42,820
Where are you coming from?

677
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,020
How did you get here?

678
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,339
We came from
where we've always come.

679
01:41:46,419 --> 01:41:50,219
- Nobody stopped you on the way?
- Who's there to stop us?

680
01:41:50,299 --> 01:41:53,700
This has been our way
since the beginning of time.

681
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,740
Have you found others like us?

682
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:05,179
- C'mon, give me the rings.
- Hand them over.

683
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:11,379
My good man!

684
01:42:13,259 --> 01:42:14,780
- My good man!
- What?

685
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:35,780
Give me your necklace.

686
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,860
- Give it to him.
- C'mon, give him the necklace.

687
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:39,940
Give it to me.

688
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,419
- C'mon!
- Are you done, yet?!

689
01:43:07,299 --> 01:43:09,740
- Don't be like that...
- Take this one too, my good man.

690
01:43:18,299 --> 01:43:20,100
Just give us a little one.

691
01:43:32,419 --> 01:43:34,660
What d'you think?

692
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,499
Why not, right?

693
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,700
Grab one. That one!

694
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,379
Take it.

695
01:44:03,139 --> 01:44:04,259
God bless!

696
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:13,100
No pity for the enemies of the people
and of the socialist revolution!

697
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:16,940
The fight to expose and punish
all subversive elements

698
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:18,940
must be intensified...

699
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,339
Since when do we believe
what they write in their paper?

700
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:27,539
I know them very well...
The truth is even worse.

701
01:44:28,459 --> 01:44:30,060
Listen to me!

702
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:32,700
We have to focus on our lives here!

703
01:44:33,299 --> 01:44:36,100
Next year we could build
a house for Ion and Ana.

704
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:38,379
You'll have other children
soon enough, right?

705
01:44:38,459 --> 01:44:40,539
So you can have
somewhere to raise them.

706
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:44,299
Why don't YOU have children
to raise in this god-forsaken place?!

707
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:47,860
Ion!... Ion!

708
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,459
We're not leaving here!

709
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:57,379
When you're not afraid anymore here,
that means you're truly free.

710
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,419
What do you still have to lose?

711
01:45:01,259 --> 01:45:02,980
What are you still afraid of?

712
01:45:14,259 --> 01:45:15,499
God bless.

713
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,179
Can you take this one back?

714
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:20,100
You're too precious to do it yourself?

715
01:46:24,539 --> 01:46:25,459
Listen...

716
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:28,780
Why don't you ask for
a house for yourself?

717
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,620
Won't be long now
until you need one, right?

718
01:47:57,860 --> 01:47:59,700
C'mon, lunch is almost ready.

719
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,379
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone.

720
01:48:28,459 --> 01:48:29,900
Sit down here.

721
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,499
Leave me alone!

722
01:48:35,459 --> 01:48:36,980
I'll fetch you some water.

723
01:48:41,539 --> 01:48:43,060
I haven't done anything wrong.

724
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:48,900
I was alone.

725
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:54,379
I'm sorry.

726
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,900
- And I'm so scared.
- Why?

727
01:49:03,219 --> 01:49:04,980
I don't want to lose it.

728
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,740
I need you, Ana.

729
01:49:47,459 --> 01:49:48,459
What are you staring at?

730
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:53,900
When are we starting our own house?

731
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:43,060
How can you go with him?

732
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:46,980
Why?

733
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:49,299
Maybe it's our fate...

734
01:50:53,219 --> 01:50:55,740
It's how you found what
you were looking for.

735
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:58,459
And how these people
started to believe in you.

736
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:05,299
You're now a free man, Emil.

737
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:13,419
This little island here is YOUR freedom.

738
01:51:13,499 --> 01:51:15,060
Ours!

739
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:20,700
I know it's not Paris, but...

740
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:25,060
...have we ever really felt this free?

741
01:51:33,299 --> 01:51:37,139
It's been 256 days since
I last touched a book.

742
01:51:39,339 --> 01:51:40,980
What's my purpose here?

743
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:04,139
Forgive me...

744
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:09,219
Come on! Move! Into the valley, let's go!

745
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:16,379
I'm not coming.

746
01:53:22,299 --> 01:53:23,780
I'd be a burden.

747
01:53:25,179 --> 01:53:26,700
Take this with you.

748
01:53:32,499 --> 01:53:34,900
Write them and tell them about us.

749
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:40,459
It's the only way the world can
find out what happened here.

750
01:53:42,139 --> 01:53:44,820
It's a good thing you learned
some French.

751
01:53:46,539 --> 01:53:48,139
You promise?

752
01:53:52,139 --> 01:53:53,620
I swear it!

753
01:53:57,459 --> 01:53:59,060
I'll be waiting.

754
01:54:04,179 --> 01:54:05,379
Are you sure?

755
01:54:08,339 --> 01:54:09,459
Well...

756
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:26,379
Wait for me!

757
01:54:59,579 --> 01:55:00,940
Turica...

758
01:55:02,339 --> 01:55:03,700
I'm fine...

759
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:06,219
...and I hope you are too.

760
01:55:08,179 --> 01:55:10,740
These French people
are something else. They

761
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,539
speak so fast that I can't
understand anything .

762
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:17,219
It's nice here.

763
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:19,620
The people are happy...

764
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:20,860
...they sing...

765
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,339
...they have fun...

766
01:55:22,419 --> 01:55:24,179
...we laugh all day.

767
01:55:28,219 --> 01:55:30,100
Wait for me. I won't be long.

768
01:55:37,339 --> 01:55:42,620
I'll drag these Frenchmen all the way
to Baragan, and we'll get you out.

769
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:59,419
Wait for me!

770
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:06,060
You're always in my mind, Turica.

771
01:56:08,459 --> 01:56:11,060
Wait for me and we'll see Paris together!

772
01:56:15,579 --> 01:56:16,740
Wait for me!

773
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:26,020
Wait for me!

774
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,700
Wait for me!

775
01:56:53,219 --> 01:56:56,499
Ashes to ashes, dust
to dust. Dear Lord,

776
01:56:56,579 --> 01:57:00,539
receive your daughter
Dumitra into Thy kingdom,

777
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:03,100
and forgive her
all her sins, those

778
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:06,299
commited willingly
and those unwillingly...

779
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:09,740
Five years later

780
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:44,179
Monster! There's a monster!

781
01:59:15,339 --> 01:59:18,620
Restriction of motion from
the previously designated

782
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,980
area is hereby lifted for
the following individuals:

783
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:24,459
Jonas Friedl...

784
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,339
Dumitra Bazan...

785
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,299
Niculae Ifrim...

786
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:31,020
Emil Bazan...

787
01:59:32,299 --> 01:59:34,219
Father Nicodim Enache...

788
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:36,179
Ileana Saculean...

789
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:37,820
Agnes Ferencz...

790
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:40,900
Ana Saculean...

791
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:45,299
Also Ion and Andrei Blajinu.

792
01:59:46,299 --> 01:59:47,499
Dora Friedl.

793
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:57,620
Good people, you are going home.

794
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:01,020
You have 24 hours to pack. A truck
will come to pick you up tomorrow.

795
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:02,499
Is it clear?

796
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:51,820
Our island was gone.

797
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:58,299
After us, other islands
were formed,

798
02:01:58,379 --> 02:02:01,740
and they'd continue to appear and
disappear, just like ours:

799
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:04,499
Budapest '56, Prague '68...

800
02:02:04,579 --> 02:02:08,620
Gdansk, Berlin,
Bucharest '89, and so on...

801
02:02:09,499 --> 02:02:10,459
So,

802
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:13,579
what's freedom?

803
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:16,940
I'll expect your answers...

804
02:02:17,419 --> 02:02:19,539
...next time, please.

805
02:02:20,339 --> 02:02:21,379
Yes?

<i>Prague '68: TheCommunist</i>
<i>Party of Czechoslovakia</i>

807
02:02:28,499 --> 02:02:32,339

808
02:02:32,419 --> 02:02:35,139
to ensure freedom of...

Budapest '56:
We demand freedom for our country

810
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:40,339

Berlin '89
Mr. Gorbaciov, tear down this wall!

814
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:06,419
"We will have true freedom
only when we don't need courage

815
02:03:06,499 --> 02:03:08,219
to be free anymore"
- Ana Blandiana

816
02:03:08,299 --> 02:03:12,660
Bucharest '89:
Comrades... sit still! Hello!

817
02:03:13,579 --> 02:03:15,179
Sit still!

818
02:03:16,179 --> 02:03:21,419
Hello, hello, hello...

819
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:44,700
"SO, WHAT'S FREEDOM?"
