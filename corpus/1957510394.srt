1
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,791
I can't hear you.

2
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,791
Louder.

3
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,375
<i>Louder!</i>

4
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,708
That's all for now.

5
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,083
Signing off.

6
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,083
From your Desiree.

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,250
She didn't expect
to die that night.

8
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:16,125
Sara Bowman was precise about everything,
and dying wasn't on her schedule.

9
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,375
She had no enemies that she knew of.

10
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,375
All in all,
her life was pretty unremarkable.

11
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:29,416
Yet there she was,
lying in a pool of her own blood.

12
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,000
The manner of her death violent,
unhinged even.

13
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:39,875
Who would want to kill
the altogether unremarkable Sara Bowman?

14
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,166
And then it hit her.

15
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,583
What if she wasn't unremarkable?
What if she had a secret life?

16
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,750
Don't we all?

17
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,750
But for some, the secret is a lot darker
and a lot more dangerous.

18
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,708
And that's when Detective Stanton
started to dig,

19
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,333
because whoever reduced Sara Bowman
to a bloody pulp

20
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,625
might be as unremarkable as she was.

21
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,291
Thank you.

22
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,291
That's the best turnout
we've had all year.

23
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,083
- Keep writing, Grace Miller.
- I couldn't stop if I tried.

24
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,000
You're the best.

25
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,458
Thank you.

26
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,791
Kathleen?

27
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,708
I'll be there on the next flight.

28
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,583
Uh, change of plans. Family.

29
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,708
Take me to the airport, please.

30
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,708
Hi.

31
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,083
Um... I didn't expect you to come so soon.

33
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,916
You told me it was urgent.

34
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,791
Yeah. Are you staying?

35
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,208
I don't know. Am I?

36
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,125
I... Yes. Of... Yeah. Come in.

37
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,208
Okay.

38
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:33,083
Wow. The old place
looks a lot like the old place.

39
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,916
Oh, the plays
that we used to put on in here.

40
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,416
We'd invite all the neighborhood kids,
remember?

41
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,750
You wrote the plays, Grace.
I just made the popcorn.

42
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,250
Coffee?

43
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,958
Wine?

44
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,208
Yeah.

45
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,041
So, why did you leave him?
Was there someone else?

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,083
You don't think I could
come to that realization on my own?

47
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,375
- Here, give me that.
- No, I got it.

48
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,666
Just give it to me. Thank you.

49
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,083
Um, Kath, why am I here?

50
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,083
I mean, seriously, are you okay?

51
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,958
I mean, do you need anything?
Do you need money?

52
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,875
That would explain the vintage.

53
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,500
Oof. You never change.

54
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,750
I haven't had to.

55
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,833
Well, I have.

56
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,000
And I'm good.

57
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,541
And I'm getting better.

58
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,791
That's great. That's great.

59
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,083
Because the last I heard,
you were addicted to pills

60
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,000
and you walked out on your son.

61
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,833
Okay, no. I didn't have a choice.
When I asked for a divorce,

62
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,625
Jonathan wanted me gone
and he wouldn't let me leave with Kevin.

63
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,125
You always had a choice.

64
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,875
I kicked the meds.

65
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,791
- Great.
- Yup.

66
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,250
And I put that degree
to good use and got a job.

67
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,125
I teach high school.

68
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,250
Drama and English.

69
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,708
And... I'm good at it.

70
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,333
And now I'm going for custody of Kevin.

71
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,083
I know that Jonathan's rich and connected.

72
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,583
He's not gonna win this time.
I will not let him.

73
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,208
He thinks that women are expendable
and that I'll just cave.

74
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,166
I cannot.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,416
Medium tea, medium coffee.

76
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,833
- Give me the money! Come on! Come on!
- Whoa, hey.

77
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,208
Pick it up! Move it, pick it up!

78
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,958
- Gimme your wallet. Your phone.
- Okay. All right.

79
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,041
Okay.

80
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,791
No!

81
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,083
- Easy.
- Hey, where's my coffee?

82
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,458
Oh, got it. Thank you.

83
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,750
Come on. Hi. Did he pay?

84
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,041
- No.
- Oh, Christ.

85
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,005
- He never pays for anything.
- Damn it.

86
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,833
Trouble finds you, Detective.
That's all I'm saying.

87
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,458
- I must be in the right job.
- Perhaps.

88
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,041
Regardless, let's get you home.

89
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,291
You got a week off.

90
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,541
I can finally finish
renovating my kitchen.

91
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,000
Mmm, on that,
uh, don't call me about tile samples.

92
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,333
- You know you want to weigh in.
- I've already made your decision for you.

93
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,708
Spanish tile. Case closed.

94
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,166
We co-own the house,

95
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,416
and I just need your approval
to get a mortgage on my half.

96
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,666
- Is that gonna be enough?
- For legal fees, it'll help.

97
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,291
I'm working on other things too, so...

98
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,500
What kind of other things, Kathleen?

99
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:15,750
Well, I have proof that Jonathan is
stealing from the family trust,

100
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,250
and if that goes public, it'll ruin him.

101
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,916
Kathleen, that's blackmail.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,750
Yeah. I'm sorry,
what makes you so pure all of a sudden?

103
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,208
You make a fortune writing books
about women getting murdered.

104
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,291
No, no, no.

105
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,458
If you had read any of my books,

106
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,375
you would know that they're about
the exploitation of women

107
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,458
and misogyny and the patriarchy

108
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,458
and how we do so very little
to protect the most vulnerable.

109
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,208
Okay? So you do you.

110
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,750
Okay. Grace.

111
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:15,625
Grace, Jonathan's gonna try
to destroy me in court as the bad mother...

112
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,541
hooked on pills, who abandoned her son.

113
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,208
I'm so afraid I'm gonna lose him.

114
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,791
I didn't even expect you to come.

115
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, of course I'm gonna come.

116
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,250
We're sisters. If you need me, I'm here.

117
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,708
A-Actually, I wanted you to need me
a whole lot sooner, but...

118
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,791
Scoot over.

119
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,625
- Okay, it's not...
- Scooch.

120
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,916
- There's no thunder or lightning.
- Oh, isn't there though?

121
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, well, don't hog the blanket.

122
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,625
Old habits die hard.

123
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

124
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,750
I'm so glad you're here.

125
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,875
I'm right here.

126
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,333
Hey! You with the saw!

127
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,125
Morning.

128
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,791
One more and I'm done.

129
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,375
Measure twice.

130
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,500
Cut once.

131
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,958
Hi!

132
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,958
- Hey.
- I hope you don't mind.

133
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,500
Uh, the gate was wide open,

134
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,000
so I just thought
I'd come over and say hi.

135
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,666
I like your house. In another life,
I'd probably be flipping houses.

136
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,875
Thanks. I'm not flipping it. It's mine.

137
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,333
Really? It's my favorite house
on the block.

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,666
Oh, um, I brought you coffee. Fresh.

139
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,250
Thanks. Um, you know,
I... I quit caffeine.

140
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
Okay.

141
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:38,000
So you are an un-caffeinated homeowner
with a miter saw.

142
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,666
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, neighbor. Um.

143
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,458
My sister lives next door.
Her name's Kathleen. Do you know her?

144
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,291
Oh, yeah. Just to say hi.
Ed. Ed Jennings.

145
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,958
Hi. Grace Miller.

146
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,291
- Hold on a second. I'll be right back.
- Oh, okay.

147
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,583
Oh.

148
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,166
- Yeah? I thought that was you.
- Yeah.

149
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,625
I see your picture
every time I pick up your books.

150
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,791
I'd be happy to sign it for you
if you have a pen.

151
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,000
- Right. That's a thing. Here you go.
- It is a thing.

152
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,333
But maybe I should be asking
for your autograph,

153
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,750
Detective Ed Jennings,
D.C. Police Homicide.

154
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,666
- Are you stalking me?
- No, I'm Googling you.

155
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
Uh, Detective Ed Jennings
who cracked a cold case

156
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,083
and arrested the ex-husband
of the murdered woman.

157
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,000
Wow. Congratulations.

158
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,833
Just part of the job.

159
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,333
Oh, take credit for it. You've earned it.

160
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,708
What I earned is a week off.

161
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,291
- A whole week off!
- Yeah, yeah.

162
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,708
I was planning on learning
how to miter corners.

163
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,083
Wow. And then maybe
we could figure out a murder.

164
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,541
Fictional, right?
You're not going to kill anyone?

165
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,958
I can't tell you that.

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,083
Okay, so next week's essay is
going to be on <i>Hamlet</i>.

167
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,875
How would Hamlet feel in our digital age?

168
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,958
@HamletTheDane would love Twitter.

169
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,750
To tweet or not to tweet,
that is the question.

170
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,833
That's good. All right, that's your essay.

171
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,166
Have a good day.

172
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,000
Rand, don't be late with this one, okay?

173
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,125
Hey, Rand. Hi.

174
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,291
Did you hear what I said?
Don't be late.

175
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,750
What are you doing? What is going on?

176
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,291
You are normally a very good student
when you apply yourself.

177
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,500
Lately...

178
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,333
- Do you want to talk about anything?
- No. Don't be late.

179
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,500
Got it.

180
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,458
- Mrs. Breezewood...
- Grace, hi.

181
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,458
<i>Hey, Kath.</i>

182
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,458
Another time.

183
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,708
<i>Uh, you know that cute
white embroidered top you have?</i>

184
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,333
- It's sleeveless. Can I borrow it tonight?
<i>- Yeah, no, go for it.</i>

185
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,416
You going somewhere?

186
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,541
Oh, well, I met your neighbor
and I'm going to see him later,

187
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,083
and he's homicide,
so obviously marriage made in heaven.

188
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,666
You move fast.

189
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,458
Just for consulting purposes.

190
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,958
<i>Right. Well, why don't you marry him
and we could live next door to each other?</i>

191
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,583
Hey, Kath, did you build a safe room?

192
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,875
Um...

193
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:39,083
Not exactly. I, um...
I'm gonna explain that later.

194
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,666
But if you want to stay out tonight
and have a good time, please do.

195
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,250
- I have papers to grade.
- No, no, no. You're cooking.

196
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,500
You're the only Miller sister
that can cook.

197
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,833
Okay. I'll see you later. Bye.

198
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,083
Hi, honey.

199
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,208
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

200
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,541
- How are you?
- <i>Good.</i>

201
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,583
Do you know what? Your Auntie Gracie
is staying here right now,

202
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,125
and she can't wait to see you.

203
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,208
<i>When?</i>

204
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,625
- Um, when you come live here.
<i>- Okay, Kevin's gotta go. It's dinner time.</i>

205
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,791
<i>- Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy."
- Bye-bye, Mommy.</i>

206
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,583
Kevin... Jonathan...

207
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,000
Hello.

208
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,958
Uh... no, tonight's not good.

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,166
Okay. Ju... Just the one, though.

210
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,875
All right. Okay.

211
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,916
- Let's review what we know.
- Okay.

212
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,875
Cops break into a room.
Door's locked from the inside.

213
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,666
- Windows are locked.
- Body in the middle of the room.

214
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,666
- Male.
- Right.

215
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,458
Gunshot wound, fatal.

216
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,041
Now, we've ruled out suicide.
Angle of the shot.

217
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,708
So, it's not about the why,
it's about the how.

218
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,791
So, how did the killer get out of the room

219
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,916
after murdering the victim
when the door was locked from inside?

220
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,250
That's a pretty devious plot you got.

221
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,708
- Ah, ah...
- Hmm.

222
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,708
Some kind of evil force.

223
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,916
- You mean like a ghost?
- Yeah, not really your thing.

224
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,375
- No.
- Okay.

225
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,791
Secret entrance.

226
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,333
Like a trap door?

227
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,416
We're sure he's dead?

228
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,291
The coroner certified
the death certificate

229
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,875
because he was bribed
by the so-called victim...

230
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,125
- Yeah.
- ...who was faking his death,

231
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,541
and he is really alive!

232
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,833
You're a little too happy about it,
but yes, finally.

233
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,541
All right, the kitchen is a war zone.

234
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,666
Fridge there, sink under the window.
Stove's going in here,

235
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,250
and I'm trying to figure out
if an island will crowd the space.

236
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,166
- Oh. Right here?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
Hmm.

238
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,541
- Should we take it for a test run?
- Yeah. What?

239
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,000
Test run. You stand here.

240
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,458
I'm at the island
chopping things right now.

241
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,083
- E-Excuse me, can I have the frying pan?
- Sure.

242
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,041
- Here.
- Thank you.

243
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,750
And I have to put something
in the dishwasher.

244
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,583
Ah, there was a dirty cup there.
Maybe you could get that for me.

245
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,791
Seems a little crowding's got
its advantages.

246
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,375
Say it.

247
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,708
Say it louder. I can't hear you!

248
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,083
Good thing we recycle.

249
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,625
- Uh-oh.
- Son of a...

250
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,583
So, if you're gonna be here
for a couple more days...

251
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,541
Uh-huh. I am.

252
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,333
- And I will.
- Will what?

253
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,333
Want to see you again.

254
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
- It's that obvious?
- It's kind of obvious, yeah.

255
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,041
Wait, let me see one more time.

256
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,083
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. I want to see you again.
- Again. All right.

257
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,916
- We had an incredible night.
- It was okay.

258
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,875
I had an incredible night.

259
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,166
And let's do more.

260
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:27,291
More of this,
but, you know, no expectations, just...

261
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,750
Why not? You know,
I have a few expectations.

262
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,416
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

263
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,458
But, Detective, I don't need
a police escort home. I'm okay.

264
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,791
- Right. Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you, though.

265
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Grace, look out!

266
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,458
- Maybe I do.
- You might.

267
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,458
Good night, Grace.

268
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,083
Okay.

269
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,416
Kath?

270
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,916
I'm home!

271
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,833
Kath, where are you?

272
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,583
Oh my God.
I just had the best date ever.

273
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Kath?

274
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,458
Kathleen? Kathleen?

275
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,458
No, no. Oh my God.
Holy shit. Oh my God.

276
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,625
Grace?

277
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,625
Hey, Grace. Hey, I got you.
I got you. Come here. Come here.

278
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,916
Who's inside?

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay, okay. Stay here. Stay here.

280
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,708
Stay back. Stay back.

281
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,916
Please. Please.

282
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,916
Please. Please. Please.

283
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,000
Please.

284
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,375
Grace?

285
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,583
She was probably so scared.

286
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,291
She was in there all alone.

287
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,416
I wasn't with her.

288
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,583
She's in there now. I'm not with her.

289
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,125
You'll be with her soon. I promise.

290
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,791
Just not now, okay?

291
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,625
You know how it goes,
what needs to be done.

292
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,208
This your case?

293
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:14,208
No, I was first on the scene.
I live next door. Is this strangulation?

294
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,916
Some kind of ligature.

295
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,791
Dude, what are you doing here?

296
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,000
Why am I here?

297
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,708
We got a week off.

298
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,875
I owe you.

299
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:44,208
Oh no, no, no.
Uh, I haven't agreed to this yet.

300
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:48,208
Ben, it happened next door
when Grace was with me. I owe it to her.

301
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,666
You're owing a lot of people tonight.

302
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,625
It's her sister.

303
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,125
Wouldn't feel right
letting someone else work this.

304
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,583
So we're supposed to get the captain
to assign this one to us

305
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,250
because of some famous writer
that you just met.

306
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,500
Right. They've taken
the statement from her.

307
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,291
- She's with the body now.
- No, I'm still not in.

308
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:08,333
You're always there for me.
You never let me down.

309
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You owe me.

310
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,916
Have a seat.

311
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,375
I'm... really sorry for your loss,
Ms. Miller,

312
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,958
and I know that this is a difficult time,

313
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,625
but we have to ask you a few questions.

314
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,958
- Now...
- Here you go.

315
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,041
Thank you.

316
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,541
Did your sister ever mention
anyone threatening her?

317
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,791
Anyone that you know
who might want to hurt her?

318
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,458
Her ex-husband,
Jonathan Breezewood.

319
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,916
Uh, what makes you say that?

320
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,375
Because she was fighting
for full custody of their son.

321
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:03,708
And she had evidence that he was involved
in... in some kind of fraud or something.

322
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:04,833
I don't know.

323
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:07,291
- Jonathan Breezewood?
- The third.

324
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:13,875
His family's really connected and rich.
He's a big shot attorney.

325
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,625
Did you know about your sister's clients?

326
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,791
What are you talking about?
She was a teacher.

327
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,208
She connected to clients via webcam.
The site was called Fantasy Inc.

328
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,541
Oh my God.

329
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,166
And from the looks
of the clothes we found,

330
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,375
she was working as a dominatrix.

331
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,833
I don't...

332
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,250
Let's get you to a hotel.

333
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,291
If you're uncomfortable being alone,

334
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,500
we can have someone
stay there with you if you want.

335
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,916
I don't want to be alone, and I don't...

336
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,541
- We have people who...
- Can I stay at your place?

337
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:16,125
<i>I mean,
I hadn't seen her for five years,</i>

338
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:19,833
<i>and the first two minutes
I started a fight with her.</i>

339
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:23,291
<i>The bedroom's under construction,
so take the couch. I'll take the chair.</i>

340
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,375
Try to get some rest.

341
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,208
Stop blaming yourself.

342
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:36,958
Who else?

343
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,458
The killer.

344
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,416
Morning.

345
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:05,833
Herbal tea?

346
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,083
No coffee?

347
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,625
Caffeine's the problem.

348
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,125
Caffeine is the point.

349
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,041
Nope.

350
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,833
You should try to ignore those.

351
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,125
It's already all over
the news, social media.

352
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,833
There's a couple news trucks
outside already.

353
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:31,500
Listen. Uh, can we keep
what she was doing confidential?

354
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,791
The least we can do
is protect her son from this part.

355
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:34,875
Absolutely.

356
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:40,166
And, uh... I want to help on the case.

357
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,333
- Grace...
- No, no.

358
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:45,833
I know this is not one of my books,
but this is personal.

359
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,666
This is real and personal.
She is my sister.

360
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,541
That's why you need to stay away from it.

361
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:54,333
But we both know that the first 48 hours
are the most important.

362
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,333
It's not your job to catch the killer,
it's mine, and I will get him,

363
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,083
but you cannot put yourself in any danger.

364
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,500
Can I... Can I go get my stuff?

365
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,750
- I will get it.
- No, no, no.

366
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,708
You don't know where to look.

367
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,041
Forensics is gone, isn't it?

368
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:11,166
Okay. You said
I know police protocol, so I'm gonna go.

369
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,541
I will not contaminate anything.

370
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:15,875
I promise.

371
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,833
Okay.

372
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,291
There she is.

373
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:28,291
Grace, Grace, do you have
any comment for us? Grace!

374
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,208
Detective Jennings, what about you?
Is this case similar to your last case?

375
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,000
Is the ex-husband a suspect like before?

376
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,000
Any comment at all?

377
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,166
Jennings.

378
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,291
Mm-hmm.

379
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah, like 20 minutes ago.

380
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,083
Grace?

381
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,541
Have you spoken to her ex-husband?

382
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,125
He was at home last night
hosting a political fundraiser.

383
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,875
Maybe he had her killed.

384
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,583
I mean, he's the likeliest suspect.
She was going to blackmail him.

385
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,375
If he had her killed, we'll find out.

386
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,708
And her... her body.

387
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:55,000
She was, uh... She was twisted,
and her arms were out,

388
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:59,833
and her... her feet were crossed
like she was on a cross.

389
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,250
Is that... intentional?

390
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,541
- Grace, we should go.
- How did she die?

391
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,416
Please.

392
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,250
Uh...

393
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,833
He, uh, came in through the back door.

394
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,916
Smashed a pane of glass.

395
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,625
<i>Left a shoe print in the dirt.
Sneaker size 11.</i>

396
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:27,000
No fingerprints. He was careful.

397
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:28,250
Likely wore gloves.

398
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,500
Did he steal anything?

399
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,791
<i>Not that we could tell.</i>

400
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,541
<i>So, he was really after her.</i>

401
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:43,833
This is what you want.
Say it! Say it!

402
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:48,083
Uh, she had marks on her neck, right?

403
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,791
What... What did he use?

404
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,000
We don't know yet.

405
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:18,583
That's all for now. Good night.

406
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,875
<i>Did she have
any clients last night?</i>

407
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,583
We're finding out.

408
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,666
Is there a timeline?

409
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,416
What we know is that she ran the shower,

410
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,333
<i>but never got in.</i>

411
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,125
Desiree.

412
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,083
I saw bruises on her, uh...

413
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:56,625
On her neck
and her... her chest and her arms.

414
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,375
She fought him.

415
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,333
Grace, we really should go.

416
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,333
Okay.

417
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,791
We were so sorry to hear about Kathleen.

418
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:52,625
We didn't know her personally,
but she was a true professional.

419
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,625
Gentlemen.

420
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,916
Her character, Desiree, was becoming
very popular with some of our clients.

421
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,791
Let's talk about those clients.

422
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,166
Why? Do you think this has
something to do

423
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,958
with the work she did for us?

424
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,625
Let's focus on her client list.

425
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:16,166
Well, I will tell you what I can,
but I'm sure there's no connection.

426
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,458
For the most part,
her clients were out of the country.

427
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,208
There's a significant percentage,
maybe 30%, within the U.S.

428
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,333
Who, uh, has access to your, uh...

429
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,125
Performers?

430
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,041
We call them performers.
They're true artists.

431
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,791
And who knows
the identity of your performers?

432
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:39,083
Just me, my mother,
and my brother. It's a family business.

433
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,375
Everything is within the law,

434
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,291
and we have the highest standards

435
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:47,875
when it comes to protecting the identities
of both our clients and our performers.

436
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:50,416
- Do you record all the sessions?
- Yes, of course.

437
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,000
For liability purposes
and creative reasons.

438
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,833
Sometimes we give feedback.

439
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,875
We're going to need
all of Desiree's sessions.

440
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,958
Oh, and that list.

441
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,708
Do you have a warrant?

442
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,333
Yeah, we think of everything.

443
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,250
So, how's our best-selling author today?

444
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,416
I don't know, man.

445
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,958
Really? What?
The, uh, bloom's off the rose?

446
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:18,416
No rose, no bloom. I just tried...

447
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,250
Yeah, to help her
make it through the night.

448
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,458
You got something you want to say, Ben?

449
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,083
Not really, Ed.

450
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:30,250
Just that when you wade in,
you go hip-deep.

451
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,791
<i>Sandy White Underwood,
principal of the academy.</i>

452
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,291
Our heartfelt condolences.

453
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:47,250
Kathleen was such a gifted teacher.
We're absolutely devastated by her loss.

454
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,125
Thank you.

455
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:57,333
Oh, it was supposed to be right here.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Excuse me.

456
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,791
Sorry to bother you.

457
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:38,250
We're so sorry.
We really loved Mrs. Breezewood.

458
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,166
She wasn't like the others.

459
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,208
You really wanted
to listen to her in class,

460
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:45,625
and, like, she really got
how we were feeling.

461
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:50,083
Yeah, she was hard on me,
but she was right.

462
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:55,375
Thank you. Thank you all.

463
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,666
Everything that was in her locker,
we put in this box.

464
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,291
Thank you, Billy.

465
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,750
I'll leave you alone.
Take your time, and if you need anything...

466
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,583
Hey.

467
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:24,375
- You're one of Kathleen's students.
- Mm-hmm. Jerald Baxter.

468
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:28,083
I... My mother's
Senator Baxter from Missouri.

469
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,250
The Show-Me State.

470
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,875
She... She won't let me say Missouri
without adding that.

471
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,416
I'm really sorry about Kathleen.

472
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,458
I mean, Mrs. Breezewood.

473
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,666
How did she die?

474
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,166
Sorry. Inappropriate. Um...

475
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,333
Do the police have any suspects?

476
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I don't know.

477
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:57,500
- I guess it could have been random.
- Most murders aren't.

478
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,583
You mean someone wanted her dead?

479
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,125
Well, I mean, that's a question
that the police are going to ask,

480
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,458
and they're probably going to ask it here.

481
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,791
Mr. Sachs got her upset.

482
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:08,916
Who?

483
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,583
He does maintenance. Billy Sachs.

484
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,750
Thank you, Billy.

485
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,958
I saw him talking to Mrs. Breezewood
the other day, and she looked upset.

486
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,750
And I heard her
ask him not to tell anyone.

487
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,166
She didn't mention it to me,

488
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,041
so I can't imagine
she would be that upset.

489
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:28,208
I wouldn't talk to anyone about this.
That's spreading rumors.

490
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,833
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

491
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,583
I... I just thought...

492
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,416
You know, in case it was useful.

493
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Hey.

494
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:09,583
Listen, thank you so much for getting
my sister's stuff. I really appreciate it.

495
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,375
Oh, it's been so hard to be here today.

496
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:17,583
You know, seeing this life that she had,
how much her students adored her...

497
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,291
She was so beautiful.

498
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:26,041
She could have been on TV
with those looks, you know.

499
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:30,916
And I don't know,
I guess in a way she kind of was.

500
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,083
It's okay, Billy. I know that you know.

501
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,666
I mean, everybody has secrets, right?

502
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,750
Don't we?

503
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:44,166
I told her I knew so she'd be careful.

504
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,500
Well, that was kind.

505
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,666
She didn't take it that way.

506
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:52,500
- Did she think you were threatening her?
- I wasn't. That's the last thing.

507
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:55,375
Well, she overreacted, right?

508
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:58,875
She just was shocked that you knew.

509
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,000
H-How did you know?

510
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,375
I only watched Desiree that one time.

511
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,083
You were a client?

512
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,166
No.

513
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:09,791
I...

514
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:12,708
Okay, you know what?
I... I don't understand.

515
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,958
You knew about Desiree,
but you weren't a client,

516
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,375
so how did you know?

517
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,000
He shows me the girls.

518
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Their tapes.

519
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:27,500
I recognized her.

520
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,041
Her voice.

521
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:34,500
- The way she moves.
- Her... I'm sorry, who is... who is he?

522
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,791
My cousin.

523
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:40,625
He's the webcam guy at Fantasy Inc.

524
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:47,625
Singapore, Bangalore,
Geneva, Glasgow, Newark.

525
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,375
The money these people
are spending on these fantasies...

526
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,500
We're in the wrong business, my friend.

527
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,125
- Florida.
- Hi.

528
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:57,125
- Hey, Grace. How are you doing?
- I'm good.

529
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,208
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

530
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,500
- In here.
- It's all in there.

531
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:07,583
The evidence of fraud
that Kathleen was collecting on Jonathan.

532
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,458
And I found it in her things at school,

533
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:13,958
which to me means that she was afraid
he'd get access to the house.

534
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:17,458
Now, if Kathleen having this
isn't motive enough

535
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,291
for him wanting her dead, I... I don't know.

536
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,708
Did he know that she had this?

537
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,541
His alibi is solid.

538
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,791
So, that's it? That clears him?

539
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,583
For now, yes. I have to go.

540
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,375
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. Um...

541
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:38,916
I want to apologize
for this morning. I'm sorry.

542
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,083
You're going through a lot.

543
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,750
It doesn't give me a free pass
to be rude to you, so I'm sorry.

544
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,125
- Have you gone to Fantasy Inc.?
- Grace!

545
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,958
I'm gonna take that as a yes,
and I'm also going to take it

546
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,125
that you're not gonna tell me
what you learned.

547
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,666
- Correct.
- Which is fine.

548
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,875
But then I'm not gonna tell you
what I learned.

549
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,333
Unless you want to trade?

550
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:07,583
I don't do trades.
But if you have material evidence...

551
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,458
Inelegant of me.

552
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,916
Let's not call it a trade.

553
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:15,291
Let's call it a request.

554
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,500
I assume that you have video
of Kathleen as Desiree,

555
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,958
and I would like to see it.

556
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,250
I would like to see her.
Before you tell me that's a horrible idea,

557
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:29,458
I just... I want you to think about
what... what it would mean to me.

558
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:35,083
And in the meantime,
of course I'm gonna tell you what I know.

559
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,625
And it is material.

560
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:43,250
Webcam guy at Fantasy Inc.
likes to watch. Let's go.

561
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,375
Richie!

562
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,666
It's the police.

563
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,000
Richie Gorman.

564
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,333
What's he done now?

565
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:20,041
I don't sell the information or anything.

566
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:23,416
I'd never do that. It's just for me.

567
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,166
I mean, I work there. I have a right
to check out the performers.

568
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,500
No. No, you don't.

569
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,833
I only told my cousin. That's it.

570
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,375
If Billy has anything to do with this,
it's his fault.

571
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,458
Ma'am.

572
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:39,958
Your cousin.

573
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
He works maintenance at her school,

574
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,125
but he's the only one I told.

575
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,750
- That's it?
- That's it. I swear.

576
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,583
No need for swearing, Richie.

577
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:52,041
Either way, we're going to find out.

578
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,625
I'll answer your question
because you turned us on to him.

579
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,041
He knew Kathleen's identity.

580
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,625
He says he only gave it
to his cousin, the janitor at school.

581
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,166
We are following up on both of them.

582
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,958
That's it. That is all that I know.

583
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,666
Or that's all you're gonna tell me.

584
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,208
- Don't play that game.
- This isn't a game!

585
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,041
I'm sorry. What I meant is...

586
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,500
What you meant is don't interfere. Right?

587
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:19,458
But don't think I'm just gonna order
sandwiches for my sister's funeral,

588
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,375
and that's it.

589
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:24,791
Fine. But stay out of my investigation.
And stay out of trouble.

590
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:39,541
It's a peace offering.

591
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,541
It's teas from around the world.
There's a tea for every occasion in there.

592
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,541
Um, a sleepy-time tea,

593
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:52,375
a tea to ease the stress of modern living,

594
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:54,583
a tea to awaken the senses.

595
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,875
Thanks.

596
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,708
I'm gonna go.

597
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,416
Stay.

598
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:07,125
<i>Good evening. Let's begin.</i>

599
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:19,833
Did you feel that?

600
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:23,916
Did it hurt... right where it should?

601
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,583
Is that how you like it?

602
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,125
You've been naughty, haven't you?

603
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,916
So, we got, uh,
shoe prints by the back door.

604
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,791
Sneakers, male, size 11.

605
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:52,666
This is Carol Hayes, a real estate agent
and also Fantasy Inc. artist.

606
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,291
It all fits.
We got ourselves a serial killer.

607
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,375
How'd we hear about this one?

608
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,625
I... You won't believe it.

609
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:08,500
I'd like to ask
that this be kept confidential.

610
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,416
Got a family.

611
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,958
A wife. My law firm.

612
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,125
I'm risking my reputation

613
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,750
because I did the right thing
and called 911.

614
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,083
You're cooperating with us.
We'll cooperate with you, Mr. Marks.

615
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,541
Take us through it, step by step.

616
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,958
Well, it was going along as usual.

617
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,666
Roxanne... I mean, she's quite special.

618
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,500
We have a... We have a good rapport.

619
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,125
Then all of a sudden...

620
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,166
<i>Here's what's going to happen.</i>

621
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
<i>Help me!</i>

622
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,583
<i>Help me!</i>

623
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,875
Like I said, I... I didn't know
if it was part of her act, or...

624
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,666
I mean, is she okay? Roxanne?

625
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,583
It's a good thing that you called this in,
Mr. Marks. But it wasn't an act.

626
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,583
Look, I need
these kinds of online interactions.

627
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:20,958
I need to keep
the complications to a minimum.

628
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,708
I have low blood sugar.

629
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,916
Mmm. Yeah.

630
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
<i>So, uh...</i>

631
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:32,041
And Daddy will see you
after school, okay, honey?

632
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,500
Alright, go on in.

633
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,750
Grace, how are you?

634
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,625
You haven't been taking my calls.

635
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:53,750
That's okay, I understand.
We're all absolutely heartbroken.

636
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,708
- How's Kevin?
- He's doing fine.

637
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:59,791
His grief counselor
and therapist recommended

638
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:03,208
that he doesn't come to the funeral today.
His age, and the trauma...

639
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,916
- Of losing his mother. Yeah.
- Here we go.

640
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:07,875
It's always the husband.

641
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,791
Didn't the police tell you
I was hosting a fundraiser that night?

642
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,500
I must have shaken a hundred hands.

643
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,791
You wanted her gone.

644
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,625
Why would I?
She didn't figure in my life or Kevin's.

645
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,083
God, she was so strong.

646
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,541
You didn't break her.
She was going to take you on.

647
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,250
You know those files
Kathleen was collecting on me?

648
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,541
They're baseless.
Just one more bad decision.

649
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:37,375
Oh yeah, and I know
how she was making that extra money.

650
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,142
The list of suspects gets to be a long one
when it comes to a dead hooker.

651
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:51,875
You're distraught.

652
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,708
So I'm going to let that go.

653
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,125
Don't come to the funeral.

654
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:08,083
Well, of course I'll be there.
I'm the grieving husband.

655
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,583
- Captain?
- Go!

656
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:19,375
Yes, Captain.
So, both victims were dominatrix.

657
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,833
Uh, not really sure of the plural.

658
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:24,041
Dominatrixes, and I'm only guessing.

659
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:26,333
Oh. Sounds right.

660
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:30,583
Uh... so both worked
for the adult site Fantasy Inc.

661
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,833
A number of similarities
between the two murders.

662
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:37,708
Method of entry, shoe print,
uh, a lack of physical evidence,

663
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,041
and, uh, similar posing of the bodies.

664
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:40,958
As in?

665
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,375
Ankles crossed, arms outstretched.
A lot like crucified on a cross.

666
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,041
Inventive, if not theologically confused.

667
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:51,750
Son of God, not daughter of God.
Calculated or careless.

668
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:57,500
You don't have this figured out by now?
You're my closer.

669
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:58,958
Thought we had something.

670
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:02,916
Kid who works at Fantasy Inc.
has access to the women's identities.

671
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,040
He's got an airtight alibi
the night of the murders.

672
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,666
Same as his cousin who he shared
the information with, same with the ex.

673
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,500
Come back with something.

674
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:12,666
Yes, ma'am.

675
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,375
Captain, ma'am.

676
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:19,166
Word is you and the victim's sister.

677
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,166
Yeah. Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm going to say.

678
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,625
We can leave it at that.

679
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:24,708
Can we?

680
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,750
I know where to draw the line.

681
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:35,416
<i>Kathleen was my little sister.</i>

682
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:42,125
She wanted me to know
how much her life had changed.

683
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,250
She discovered that...

684
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,625
that she loved to teach.

685
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,375
And she loved her students.

686
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,625
But most of all...

687
00:51:58,375 --> 00:51:59,708
she loved Kevin.

688
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,333
Her son.

689
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,083
Her reason to live.

690
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,708
So losing her like this,

691
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,750
well, it's really hard.

692
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:21,958
There was so much promise
and hope and motivation.

693
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,875
My baby sister.

694
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:32,083
I was privileged to have known her,
and to have loved her,

695
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,541
and to have been loved by her.

696
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,166
Thank you.

697
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:47,833
Let us pray.

698
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,208
Thank you for being here.

699
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,708
Thank you for having us.

700
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,375
Thank you, Father. Thank you.

701
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:02,583
Hi.

702
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,416
- Thank you both for coming.
- Real sorry, Grace.

703
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,750
The forensics team's done with the house.

704
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:14,500
You're free to move back in,
unless that's...

705
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:17,750
Oh yeah, no.
I'm definitely going to be moving in.

706
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:22,916
Jonathan Breezewood was
spying on Kathleen.

707
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,375
He knew about Desiree.

708
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,041
He knew about the file
that she was keeping on him,

709
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,250
and he admitted that to me.

710
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,375
So what does that tell you about motive?

711
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,166
The eulogy was beautiful, Grace.

712
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,583
We'll be in touch.

713
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:58,041
Excuse me. Can I have a second?
Thank you so much.

714
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,750
The funeral is Invitation only.

715
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:04,875
Kathleen wouldn't want you here.
I don't want you here.

716
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,041
Careful, Grace.

717
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,250
I won't have you tarnish my good name.

718
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:12,250
Now, reign in your overactive imagination,
or I will do it for you.

719
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:15,416
Senator!

720
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,083
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here.

721
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,208
No, no. It's okay, Jerald.

722
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,083
I'm so glad you could be here.

723
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:43,750
Mrs. Breezewood said one time
that lilies mean innocence.

724
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:44,875
Mmm.

725
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,791
You see them at funerals
because they symbolize

726
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,458
that death restores innocence
to the departed.

727
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:54,750
At least,
that's what our grandmother told us.

728
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,041
I sent them. The lilies.

729
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,333
Jerald.

730
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:07,791
Apologies, Ms. Miller.
My son has problems with boundaries.

731
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,625
Oh no. Jerald has been
nothing but thoughtful.

732
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,375
My sincere condolences. Martha Baxter.

733
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,666
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you so much for coming.

734
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:18,541
Jerald.

735
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:04,708
- Hey.
- Grace.

736
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,708
I've got something.

737
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:11,083
Hi, Captain Rivera. I am Grace Miller,
Kathleen Breezewood's sister.

738
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:15,375
I know who you are, and I want to say
how very sorry I am for your loss.

739
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:16,666
- We all are.
- Thank you.

740
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,958
I just need
five minutes of your time, please.

741
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,916
Detective Jennings, will you join us?

742
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,750
Hmm.

743
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:29,250
It's an in memoriam card.
It was sent to the church.

744
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:32,583
It says, "Desiree,
now you are where you belong."

745
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:36,500
We'll have the card checked for prints.
Thank you for bringing that in.

746
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:41,458
Sure. Uh, Captain,
I really think that I can contribute a lot

747
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:43,250
to this investigation.

748
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,958
Detective, have you made
any promises to Ms. Miller?

749
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,583
God no, he's been
keeping me away from everything,

750
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,291
but there's a second victim now.

751
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,708
Captain, I have an instinct for motive.

752
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:57,166
I mean, it's why
my books are so successful.

753
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,500
I can get inside the mind of a killer,
especially the ones that prey on women.

754
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:06,791
Do you know how long it took the NYPD
to find the Times Square rapist?

755
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,958
Eight months.

756
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:14,708
And I came in, I studied the case,
and they caught the guy three days later.

757
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:18,791
So all I'm saying is
you can use me as an asset.

758
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:23,083
Fresh thinking sometimes makes
all the difference, you know?

759
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:28,416
Let me in on this.
I promise you you will not regret it.

760
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,625
Grace, I read your books cover to cover
the minute I can get my hands on them.

761
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,750
You really are one of
the most astute profilers out there.

762
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,750
I just can't see you
contributing to this case.

763
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,416
Okay, well, let's just take the bodies,
for instance.

764
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,875
They look like they're in the same pose,
but there is a difference between them.

765
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:53,583
Like, Kathleen's body,
it looks... haphazard,

766
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:57,125
like they just left her
in her very last moment.

767
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:03,708
Whereas the second victim,
it's like he took more care with her,

768
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:08,041
to pose her maybe
in a position that mimicked Kathleen's.

769
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,000
Which we already discussed.

770
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:14,666
How he poses the bodies,
suggesting a motive meant to mislead us.

771
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:19,500
Okay. Why dominatrixes,
two of them? What's that about?

772
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,416
Well, something that Ed... Uh...

773
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:24,458
Sorry, Detective Jennings said,

774
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:26,791
uh, was that maybe it was about control.

775
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:30,666
And I really think that that is the key
to finding the motive.

776
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,250
Or maybe it's random.

777
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,375
Listen, it can't be both.

778
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:36,726
- Detective Jennings...
- Captain.

779
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,916
...I'm approving Grace Miller
as a consultant.

780
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Give her all the access she needs.

781
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:47,125
I like your captain. She's decisive.

782
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,291
"Fresh thinking can make
all the difference," huh?

783
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:53,750
Ed, I respect what you do, your expertise.
How about you do the same for me?

784
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:57,666
We're results-driven here, Grace.
In the real world, that's how it works.

785
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,750
Okay, you know what?

786
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:02,583
You want me to believe
that Jonathan Breezewood is not a suspect.

787
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,041
I'll keep an open mind.

788
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,458
Sorry. Um, we just got tape
on the Carol Hayes murder.

789
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,583
"Give her all the access she needs."

790
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,750
<i>So, here's what's going to happen.</i>

791
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:37,208
<i>Help me!</i>

792
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,833
<i>Help me!</i>

793
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,541
<i>Desiree.</i>

794
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:55,291
What was that? What did he say? Go back.

795
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,458
<i>Desiree.</i>

796
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,875
So, not random.

797
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:23,125
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

798
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:28,208
Hey. We traced the card.
It came with flowers sent to the church.

799
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,333
What kind of flowers?

800
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:32,083
Roses. We got the name on the credit card.

801
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,333
- Okay.
- Let's go. All of us.

802
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:41,708
Desiree? That's not a name a man forgets.

803
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,666
And this Kathleen Breezewood? No idea.

804
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:49,791
You sent flowers to her funeral.
Charged to your credit card.

805
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,541
Yeah. Flowers by Emily.

806
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:54,458
Funeral arrangement,
with this handwritten note.

807
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,541
It's not my handwriting.

808
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:02,375
Is it your son's?
Your son is Rand Morgan, right?

809
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:06,000
Kathleen Breezewood was his teacher.

810
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:09,291
Where was Rand
on the evening of the 10th?

811
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,125
The 10th.
At the Kennedy Center with my wife.

812
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,958
- And he was there the whole night?
- Rand wasn't feeling well.

813
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,001
I had my driver
take him home at the intermission.

814
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,791
What size shoe is your son?

815
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,875
Size 11, or so.

816
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:26,166
Mr. Morgan,
we'd like to speak with your son.

817
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:28,583
Now would be great.

818
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,416
That night at the Kennedy Center,
you weren't feeling well, remember?

819
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,208
The driver brought you home
at intermission

820
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,291
and you were here till we came back.

821
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:45,625
Yeah.

822
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,375
You can prove you were here?
You never left the house.

823
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,625
I was here. The housekeeper saw me.

824
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,458
We're gonna have to talk to her.

825
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:54,750
And did you use your father's credit card

826
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,291
to order flowers
to Kathleen Breezewood's funeral?

827
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,458
No, I have my own credit card.

828
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,875
And no, I didn't send flowers.

829
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,333
No, I mean, why? The class did.

830
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:08,166
Hi.

831
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:13,500
How did you feel about my sister?

832
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,958
How do you mean?

833
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,583
Well, you told me
that she was hard on you.

834
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:23,083
- Yeah.
- Were you attracted to her?

835
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,541
No. No, no, no. She was old.

836
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Older.

837
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,666
I mean, no,
she was... she was hot. But...

838
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,250
- Rand.
- No, she asked.

839
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:40,958
I didn't think about her
outside of class. Even in class.

840
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,250
Okay?

841
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,000
Our housekeeper's information.

842
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,333
Thank you for your time.
We'll get back to you.

843
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,625
Good work.

844
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:09,250
Look at these kids. They've got it made.

845
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,666
There's killers in every tax bracket.

846
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,750
- What do you think, Grace? The kid?
- He's definitely hiding something.

847
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,791
Writer's instinct? Had to be him
that used the credit card

848
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,458
to send the flowers and the card.
That's what he's hiding.

849
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:25,375
He's too smart to be that blatant.
There's something else.

850
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:42,583
That's all for now.

851
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:48,333
Good night.

852
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:35,625
Desiree.

853
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,750
We've got three clients

854
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,666
who had regular meetings
with Desiree and Roxanne.

855
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,416
- Locals?
- London, Paris, Berlin.

856
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,708
Contact Interpol.

857
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:14,291
I'll check in with immigration,
find out if any of them are in D.C. now.

858
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,250
There's been another attack.
This one survived.

859
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,791
There's blood on the blade.
Lab will get us results real quick.

860
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,666
What's the victim's name?

861
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,083
- Bethany Knowles.
- Thank you.

862
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,833
Hey, Bethany. I'm Detective Jennings.

863
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:38,541
This is my partner, Detective Parker,
and this is Ms. Miller.

864
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:43,041
How are you doing?

865
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:50,375
My husband was out with the kids.

866
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:54,000
We keep them away when I'm working.

867
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,833
Thank God they got back at the right time.

868
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,375
Can you tell us about him,
the guy that attacked you?

869
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:09,625
Uh...

870
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,875
Bethany, we want you to know

871
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:19,291
how incredibly relieved we are
that you're okay,

872
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,666
and really how brave you are.

873
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:23,291
You fought him off,

874
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:24,958
and there's blood on the knife,

875
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,041
which is evidence,

876
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,583
and that's gonna help us
put this guy away.

877
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:34,500
He was... white.

878
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:36,875
Six feet or so.

879
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,333
His strength surprised me.

880
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,458
Did he call you by a name?

881
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,166
Desiree.

882
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:52,875
And why did his strength surprise you?

883
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,875
Because he seemed so young.

884
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:57,708
How young?

885
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:00,125
Like a teenager.

886
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:07,125
He was wearing a really fancy watch.

887
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:09,708
Sorry, what do you mean, fancy?

888
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,125
Gold, silver?

889
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,208
Gold.

890
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,916
With those little faces inside
that tell time all over the world.

891
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,125
You know. Expensive.

892
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:27,666
A search warrant?

893
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,416
Hey. Size 11s.

894
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,458
This search warrant is just fishing!

895
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:59,416
Are you going to round up
every kid with a size 11 shoe?

896
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,541
How long you had this?

897
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:04,458
Rand's wrestling team
won State two years ago.

898
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,416
The coaches got them all one,
even the student managers.

899
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,833
He never wears it.

900
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,851
- You been out tonight?
- He hasn't left the place.

901
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:14,583
Is that true? Is that
what the cameras are going to show?

902
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,291
I went for a walk in the park.

903
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,500
Take off your shirt.

904
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,166
- Uh...
- It's in the warrant.

905
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:23,791
Do it.

906
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:31,166
- Care to explain that?
- Don't answer.

907
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:37,416
In here.

908
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,291
- Where's Grace?
- Wherever she wants to be.

909
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:52,625
What do you want?

910
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:56,041
Whatever it is
that you haven't told me so far.

911
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:59,666
I told you.
My cousin Richie works for Fantasy Inc.

912
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:03,000
He's the one who told me
about your sister. That's it.

913
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:04,458
Who else did he tell?

914
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,750
I don't want anyone else
getting in trouble.

915
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:11,583
Trust me, okay? Rand Morgan is
in plenty of trouble already.

916
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,375
He told him.

917
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,708
Richie. About Desiree.

918
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,583
Him and Richie.

919
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,625
They're...

920
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,333
together.

921
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,541
<i>They don't want anyone else to know.</i>

922
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:31,458
He's tech-savvy.
I mean, that set-up in his room?

923
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:36,041
Sneakers size and print matched
the prints at all three crime scenes.

924
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:38,500
The mud on his runners is not a match.

925
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:39,583
The gold watch.

926
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:43,416
You can buy it
in some recognition gifts catalog.

927
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,041
It's real gold and expensive,
but nowhere near as rare as it looks.

928
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,916
He was gone from the house tonight
for 90 minutes.

929
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
The composite sketch
from Bethany's description could be him.

930
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:55,791
Lab says it's not his blood
on Bethany Knowles' knife.

931
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:58,375
So, you buy his story
about cutting his arm

932
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,291
when he jumped a fence in the park?

933
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:05,416
Look, we've got his computer.
He spent time on Fantasy Inc.

934
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,541
He looked at Desiree five times.

935
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:10,666
- Also Roxanne and Bethany.
- It could be a curiosity.

936
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:14,000
Ed, look, I know you're playing
devil's advocate, but come on.

937
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,250
The evidence against the kid
is stacking up.

938
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,083
Okay, Rand is not the killer.

939
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:21,041
Rand is Richie's boyfriend.

940
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:23,500
Richie is the kid from Fantasy Inc.

941
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,666
And Rand is not out to his dad yet.

942
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:30,291
Which, to me... I am willing to bet money
that Rand and Richie were together

943
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,916
at the time of the other murders.

944
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,041
And, obviously,
I agree with Ed on curiosity.

945
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,041
That's good work, Grace.

946
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:42,375
Can I have five?

947
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,708
Writer's instincts.

948
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:54,833
Paid off.

949
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,083
Uh, tell me about Desiree.

950
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,958
It was her creation.

951
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:04,041
It takes talent
and imagination for performance.

952
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:05,541
Your sister had both.

953
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:10,208
A lot of clients are
missing Desiree right now.

954
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:13,000
In fact, it's having
a big impact on our business.

955
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:16,791
I have, uh,
been interviewing a few new ones,

956
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,208
but they'll never be another Desiree.

957
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What if there is?

958
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,750
<i>This is your Desiree.</i>

959
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:04,375
I'm in the mood... to play.

960
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,958
<i>This is what you want.</i>

961
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,958
Say it! Say it!

962
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,250
Grace, hey. Come in.

963
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:28,875
Kitchen cabinets arrived.
Flat front panel.

964
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,375
Going for modern.

965
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:34,625
Look, uh, so,

966
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,041
I was gonna go over and see you.

967
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,083
I respect you, Grace.
What you bring to this. I'm only...

968
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:47,041
wanting you to stay safe.

969
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:56,250
If anything ever happened to you,
I would lose my mind.

970
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:29,875
Grace.

971
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,375
Once isn't going to be enough.

972
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:18,541
Good morning.

973
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:20,041
Mmm.

974
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,416
It's a very good morning.

975
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,625
Any regrets?

976
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:27,541
None.

977
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:31,875
It's only going to get
more complicated from here.

978
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,416
- Oh.
- Here.

979
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,916
Hmm. Meeting in an hour.

980
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,291
Mm-hmm.

981
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:49,375
Free donuts are a thing, though.
And they are delicious.

982
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,458
Mm-mm.

983
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:57,833
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

984
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:00,833
I was planning an intervention
with the two of you this morning,

985
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:03,958
but apparently there's
a change in the weather.

986
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:12,625
- Morning, everybody.
- Okay, let's get this party started.

987
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:19,125
Uh, we confirmed
that Rand was with his Fantasy Inc. friend

988
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,625
both nights in question.

989
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:24,041
And we began questioning students
at Kathleen Breezewood's school,

990
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,458
starting with her English
and drama students.

991
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:29,708
This may be the way to go,
but that is only one possibility.

992
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,333
I actually thought of another possibility.

993
01:15:32,416 --> 01:15:36,500
What if we bait the killer
out into the open...

994
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:41,000
by using me as the bait?

995
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,291
I'd become Fantasy Inc.'s new Desiree.

996
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:47,583
Same name, same playroom, similar outfit.

997
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,875
And I trigger the killer to come after me.

998
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:53,583
- Come on.
- Fantasy Inc. agreed to this?

999
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,541
Honestly, they're willing to do
whatever it takes to solve this,

1000
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:59,375
and... so am I.

1001
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,583
It's worth a shot.

1002
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,125
Hold on. You can't be good with this.

1003
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:07,458
She's about motivation, and instinct,
and solving murders on paper,

1004
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:08,666
not in the line of fire.

1005
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,833
Okay, well, I have
a lot of thoughts on motive,

1006
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:15,250
but this gets us there a lot faster
before someone else has to die.

1007
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:18,041
- That someone could be you.
- Grace, you got guts.

1008
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,500
And a twisty mind.

1009
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,125
Let's do it.

1010
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:23,416
- Come... Captain!
- Save it.

1011
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:27,666
Weather changes awful fast around here.

1012
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,541
I'm sorry. I didn't tell you

1013
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:38,125
because I thought
you would try to talk me out of it.

1014
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,791
Well, you got that right.

1015
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:48,458
<i>Good evening. Desiree is back.</i>

1016
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:54,000
I can't hear you. Louder.

1017
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:04,541
Say it!

1018
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:07,875
Say it!

1019
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,250
So let's begin.

1020
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,833
This is what you want.
This is what you need.

1021
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:27,208
Can you jump back to camera A for me?

1022
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,125
So, how long do you think

1023
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:36,000
before he realizes
that there's another Desiree?

1024
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:40,666
He might be
smart enough to wait a while.

1025
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,625
Just got word,
Jonathan Breezewood's acting attorney

1026
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,500
for a real estate conglomerate

1027
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:10,708
with some ties
to pretty sketchy investors.

1028
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:14,208
If he wanted to put a hit out,
he knew who to call.

1029
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,291
I don't know. I know Jonathan Breezewood.

1030
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:20,708
I can see him wanting Kathleen dead,
but the other two, it's just...

1031
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,625
Copycat murders.
Wouldn't be the first time.

1032
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:26,958
- Two killers?
- Fresh thinking.

1033
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:30,416
Follow up on Breezewood,
and go to that school.

1034
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,833
Your copycat killer, if he exists,
could be in those classrooms.

1035
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,166
I don't think
I even spoke to Mrs. Breezewood. Ever.

1036
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,125
I was always hoping she'd notice me.

1037
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:46,125
I wasn't really into,
you know, drama or English.

1038
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:49,791
Anything struck you as unusual?

1039
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:51,291
Mm-mmm.

1040
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:54,458
How about her relationship
with her students?

1041
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:55,541
It's good.

1042
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:01,541
Your teacher was murdered.
Time to speak up if you know anything.

1043
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:04,125
I really liked her. Everyone did.

1044
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,875
I... I just can't imagine
anyone from this school

1045
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,500
doing that to Mrs. Breezewood.

1046
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:14,291
I bet any of those kids
could have hacked into the site

1047
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,791
without leaving tracks.

1048
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,958
All they have to do
to hide their IP address is

1049
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:20,708
hack into some unprotected system
outside the country.

1050
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,041
You're really off your game, Randy.

1051
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:42,875
Don't call me that.

1052
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:46,750
I got you down.
Held you down and kept you there, Randy.

1053
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,083
Kathleen?

1054
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,916
Or should I say Desiree?

1055
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,000
- You get off watching her?
- Think this is a joke?

1056
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:07,375
No, the only joke is
the cops think I killed her.

1057
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:13,250
And bro, you were the one
who was obsessed with her.

1058
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:16,666
I saw the way you looked at her.

1059
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:21,166
She's my Kathleen! My Kathleen!

1060
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:36,750
You're not gonna get it.

1061
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,753
- No, that's cool.
- You know I hate... Jennings.

1062
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,291
Thanks.

1063
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:44,750
What is going on?

1064
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:49,166
Rand Morgan's in the ER. His father said
Jerald's the one who put him there.

1065
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:53,416
Hey. Stay sharp.

1066
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,708
- What happened?
- Jerald Baxter tried to kill him!

1067
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:10,291
Rand.

1068
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:11,375
He lost it

1069
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:16,541
when I said that I...
I knew she was Desiree.

1070
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:21,750
He, uh... he called her his Kathleen.

1071
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:30,701
Speech for the Missouri Beef Alliance.

1072
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,458
It's a good thing they don't know
I've turned vegetarian.

1073
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,458
You know the rules.

1074
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:51,833
Jerald, when I speak to you,
I expect you to respond.

1075
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:52,916
I know the rules.

1076
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,166
Only you can use your device at dinner.

1077
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,333
I'm taking you to a therapist.

1078
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,166
Since that teacher's funeral,
you've been...

1079
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,125
We have grief counselors coming tomorrow.

1080
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,875
Be in front of the school at 10:30.

1081
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:09,291
Mom, I hardly knew her.

1082
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,250
I feel bad, but I'll get over it.

1083
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:16,291
There. Just saved you 10k.

1084
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,291
If my only concern in parenting you
were tied to a dollar figure,

1085
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,000
I never would have had you.

1086
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:33,958
Grace. We just issued
an arrest warrant for Jerald Baxter.

1087
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:35,083
We got our killer.

1088
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:38,791
- You have enough evidence to charge him?
- Enough to question him.

1089
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:42,250
And all the evidence we thought we had
on Rand Morgan actually points to Baxter.

1090
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,875
Even the composite sketch.

1091
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,833
Okay. You know his mom's a senator,

1092
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:48,166
so we got to make sure
that evidence is solid.

1093
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:52,125
We'll get it. Thank you, Grace,
for all of your insights,

1094
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:55,916
and obviously for being willing
to put yourself out there.

1095
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,458
But at the end of the day,
it's solid police work that gets us there.

1096
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,625
So, we can all stand down
and you can get out of that costume.

1097
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:08,708
Okay, boys. Let's pack it up and go home.

1098
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,375
- I've an arrest warrant for Jerald Baxter.
- What?

1099
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:11,750
For the murders
of Kathleen Breezewood and Carol Hayes...

1100
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:12,833
This is ridiculous.

1101
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,434
...and the attempted murder
of Bethany Knowles.

1102
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:15,809
- Who's your captain?
- Where is he?

1103
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:18,208
He's in the basement,
but he's very studious.

1104
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:19,916
He doesn't like to be disturbed.

1105
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,291
Jerald! Jerald!

1106
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:24,666
Jerald!

1107
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:30,166
D.C. Homicide, open the door!

1108
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:45,875
All right, we're clear.

1109
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,791
Calling an APB. Jerald Baxter.

1110
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:59,166
Hmm. You don't look surprised.

1111
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,000
Mmm.

1112
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:05,166
You're a smart boy, Jerald.
I knew you wouldn't get caught.

1113
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,916
I also knew
that you would rush right over here.

1114
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:11,708
To Desiree.

1115
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:15,333
You think you know everything.
I loved Kathleen.

1116
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:18,000
Yeah, you loved Kathleen

1117
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:22,125
because she embodied everything
that your mother isn't.

1118
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:25,250
She was nurturing and caring.

1119
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:30,375
But once she became Desiree,
well, you had to kill her, right?

1120
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:32,375
Because she was trying to control you,

1121
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:36,125
and that was
a little too close to home for you.

1122
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:37,208
Wow.

1123
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:40,708
And your readers lap that up?

1124
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,250
Here's the part you haven't written.

1125
01:26:44,916 --> 01:26:50,000
The part when Jerald
squeezes the life out of the sister,

1126
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,166
walks away undetected,

1127
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:57,791
goes home and calls 911
to say, his voice shaking,

1128
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:00,375
that he's found his dear mother's body

1129
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:03,458
at the foot of the stairs,
her neck broken.

1130
01:27:04,708 --> 01:27:06,750
Then the sad truth uncovered.

1131
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,833
Her secret drinking habit.

1132
01:27:08,916 --> 01:27:13,000
As the son weeps uncontrollably,

1133
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:18,708
grieving for his famous mother,
the mother of Missouri.

1134
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:24,750
Oh, you got to admit, I got writing talent
too, don't you think, Grace?

1135
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,541
You killed my sister.

1136
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:28,250
I killed Desiree!

1137
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:30,250
I had to!

1138
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,208
But that hurt me.

1139
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:39,625
Knowing that I would never see
Kathleen's smile encourage me.

1140
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:43,875
You killed Kathleen,
you killed Carol Hayes,

1141
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,208
and you tried to kill Bethany Knowles.

1142
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,875
Yes, they're all Desiree! All of them!

1143
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,833
That's it. It's over.

1144
01:27:57,916 --> 01:28:01,125
It's a confession,
it's live, and it's out there.

1145
01:28:01,708 --> 01:28:04,625
No one needs to die here tonight.
Not me, not you.

1146
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,750
You're gonna die tonight!

1147
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:09,000
Unless you beg me!

1148
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,291
Go on. Beg!

1149
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,166
She loved me!

1150
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,208
Beg me! Beg me!

1151
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:52,916
Freeze!

1152
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,625
Are you okay? Hey, Grace.

1153
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:07,625
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1154
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:13,166
I'm okay.

1155
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,416
Looks like I turned someone
into a tea drinker.

1156
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,375
- Mmm.
- What kind did you get?

1157
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
- Awakens the senses.
- Mmm.

1158
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:35,958
Although I feel like
my senses are already pretty awake.

1159
01:29:36,041 --> 01:29:39,916
Hmm. That is called
case closed adrenaline,

1160
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,958
and there's nothing like it.

1161
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:47,666
No, I was thinking it's another kind of
non-police-related adrenaline.

1162
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,750
Like what?

1163
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:51,708
I don't know.

1164
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:55,041
I don't know where this is going.

1165
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:56,916
Want to find out?

1166
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:00,375
Like someone once said,

1167
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,875
"Once is not going to be enough."
