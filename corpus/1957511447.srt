started over 40 years ago at that house

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:37,569
for the next several decades the evil spread
like a plague you can't control it's like

23
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:55,639
a disease infecting everyone and everything
he comes in that wretched place was destroyed

24
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,490
a long time ago but not before

25
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:08,810
there are dozens of documented and apparently
related incidences of unexplained phenomena

26
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:31,680
dating back to the 1980s then an old clock
later a mirror in the replica dollhouse our

27
00:05:31,680 --> 00:06:16,070
believed to possess the same evil that was
birthed in that place

28
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:44,550
that wicked toy was obtained from that very
home

29
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:57,200

son's birthday oh well holy [ __ ] that's

34
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,080
more than enough reason for me to break into
an abandoned house and crawl around a dark

35
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,900
basement it gets better it better get better
while the mother son and daughter were all

to do i'm gonna go now bye wait

164
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
so

165
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,619
just in 12 confirmed dead just outside of
lincoln in the state of nebraska information

166
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:22,814
is coming through when 12 bodies have been
found just outside of lincoln police have

167
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:27,730
yet to release the names of the dead but most
are believed to be members of the same family

168
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:34,240
witnesses are said to have heard several gunshots
coming from the house in the area believed

169
00:47:34,240 --> 00:48:52,240
to be owned by mr mark jensen we go over now
to lincoln police to speak to officer chad

170
00:48:52,240 --> 00:49:55,030
wilson officer wilson hi peter yes i'm afraid
that the final number of deaths has now been

171
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:40,029
confirmed at 14 and i can also confirm that
the body of mr mark jensen was one of them

172
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:46,130
mr jensen was and remains our chief suspect
in this investigation due to his having shot

173
00:50:46,130 --> 00:51:16,109
himself at the roadside however what led mr
jensen to kill his entire family still remains

174
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:18,779
a complete mystery he was a well-known and
respected member of this neighborhood if all

175
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:23,529
is as it seems we've closed off the surrounding
areas to present visitors and respectfully

176
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:26,190
ask all members of the public to stay away
whilst we continue to invest thank you officer

177
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:32,089
wilson apparently we've got a recording of
a neighbor of mr jensen's let's see what he

178
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,599
had to say

179
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,390
i heard all these gunshots

180
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:44,499
so that's why i came outside to see what was
going on

181
00:51:44,499 --> 00:52:05,059
and that's when i saw the blood i'm sorry
i i can't say anymore so what makes a man

182
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:41,099
turn a gun on his entire family i have with
me today father hudson west and retired police

183
00:52:41,099 --> 00:53:00,670
detective dustin stafford gentlemen hi peter
how would you evaluate this situation uh well

184
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:41,069
situations like this are a difficult of the
best of times uh coming into it from um you

185
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:52,630
know fairly cold like yourself i've just seen
what's been going on in the news and things

186
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:59,009
like that um without knowing any kind of background
information on uh mr jensen i believe his

187
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:04,170
name was it's very very difficult to actually
appreciate what's going through his head at

188
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:18,030
the time um you know i don't i personally
have no uh working knowledge of him so i you

189
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,349
know it's very difficult to assess as to whether
there was any kind of mental instability there

190
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:20,349
whether it's being drug led whether you know

191
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:33,849
excuse me you guys you you always go down
that it's it's drugs and it's it's it's bad

family homes well i wasn't saying that but
you do you that you you people just don't

193
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:49,720
understand that there are other things happening
that there's there's other forces and and

194
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,180
something like this you know somebody just
wiping out an entire family and you know this

195
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,700
gotta be more than just a guy flipping on
drugs this is nothing to do with drugs and

in great danger what do you mean you have

216
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,930
a monkey don't you how did you know about
that

217
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:14,930
that's the only reason why you'd be here it's
evil isn't it

218
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:15,930
it's more than just evil it's it's the vessel
for which evil transfers between physical

219
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:16,930
locations spreading all over like like a plague
it all began back in amityville

220
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:17,930
after he murdered his entire family everything
from the estate sale went to auction houses

221
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:18,930
and antique shops could be a

222
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,930
whole 40 years before i would find it i don't
understand so the ghosts of the family entered

223
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:20,930
the monkey and made it evil it's the monkey
itself that caused murders in the first place

224
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:21,930
something demonic took over that toy very
long time ago and won't let go how do you

225
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:22,930
know all this it was me that brought it back
home

226
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,930
it's my fault my father killed my entire family
i purchased that monkey from the amityville

227
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:24,930
antique shop as a present for his 50th birthday

228
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,930

00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:26,930
wow ah mom would you look at this it is

230
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:27,930

the past several decades lamps and and clocks
and mirrors and even a dollhouse from that

278
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:53,839
evil place have all been present during several
copycat killings in the 90s i think i remember

279
00:59:53,839 --> 01:00:28,339
reading about some of those weren't there
some movies made or something hollywood loves

280
01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:40,670
to exploit what makes money

281
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:50,900
maybe maybe i'll even sell my story for a
made-for-tv movie so how do we get rid of

282
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,900
it

283
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,089
we must destroy the physical body forcing
it to leave and move on so then that won't

284
01:00:56,089 --> 01:01:00,661
really stop it will it

285

evil never dies time's up

287
01:01:05,661 --> 01:02:21,799
you must destroy it you can't let it take
over anyone else
