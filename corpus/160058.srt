1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,478
l miss you.

2
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,111
Testing. Testing.

3
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,834
-Hey, Brit.
-Hey.

4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,355
-How you doing?
-l'm okay.

5
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,955
Don't worry, sweetie.
lt'll be okay.

6
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,953
Your mom will always be with you.

7
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,637
Seniors.

8
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,677
Quiet down.

9
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,070
Seniors!

10
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,949
This party atmosphere
quite simply has to stop.

11
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,031
Move.

12
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,997
God, bitch!

13
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,993
No wonder they held her back twice.

14
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,112
Maya, l heard Principal Mosster's
making you work the school paper.

15
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,872
Yeah, that or juvie.

16
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,636
Now, l'm joined today by Detective
Morrison and Coroner Haynes.

17
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,349
They're here to enlighten you
on the dangers of excess.

18
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,794
Now, listen up.

19
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,359
Detective.

20
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,517
-l can promise you all one thing.
-That this will be short?

21
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,035
That if you party too hard
for the rest of this school year...

22
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,033
...we're the people
you're gonna meet.

23
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,430
l've seen it too many times
to even count.

24
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,516
A kid gets a hold of some alcohol,
maybe some drugs...

25
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,116
...and you don't know
when enough is enough.

26
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,430
Call goes out...

27
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,629
...and that's where the coroner,
Dr. Haynes, comes in.

28
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,555
That's where l come in.
And a few days later...

29
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,076
...a badly decomposed corpse
washes up on the beach.

30
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,515
lt becomes my job
to identify the body.

31
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,433
-And do you know how l do that?
-Dental records.

32
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,591
-Kiss ass.
-Yeah.

33
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,911
lt's a sad and sorry task,
but yes, that's how it's done.

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,548
And if there's no dental records?

35
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,199
Well, then we would have to carry out
a DNA analysis...

36
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,999
-...of the corpse's bone marrow.
-That's fucked up.

37
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,636
lt's not that difficult of a process.

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,839
You take the bone marrow
and grind it up in these little pieces...

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,232
...and then you add in some
dye elements and some chemicals...

40
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,472
...and you put that all
in an agarose gel.

41
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,155
-Get it up!
-Then you take your gel and put that....

42
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,673
My apologies, detective.

43
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,718
lt's so hard to keep their attention,
especially today.

44
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,519
-Why, what's today?
-The district volleyball final.

45
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,558
They love their volleyball here
at Blue Bay.

46
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,994
Can't think why.

47
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,754
Blue Bay sucks!

48
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,034
Here's a new angle
on the Brittney Havers story.

49
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,749
Forget that whole preppy,
popular-girl bullshit.

50
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,399
Let's go deeper.

51
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,279
Let's expose how
little Miss Trailer Park...

52
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,829
...became the richest bitch
at Blue Bay High.

53
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,077
Get it up! Get it up! Let's go!

54
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,277
-Come on!
-Yeah! Good shot. Come on!

55
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,515
Almost, Brittney.
You suck!

56
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,638
All right, let's go! Get it on!

57
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,919
Tie breaker.
Close. Very close.

58
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,992
The suspense is killing me.

59
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,593
Party at your house, Brit.

60
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,672
<i>Blue Bay! Blue Bay! Blue Bay!</i>

61
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,390
Hey, Brit, what's up?

62
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,235
l'll be in a world of shit when
my stepfather finds out about this.

63
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,551
Oh, my God. Have fun.
Don't worry about it. lt's a party.

64
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,349
Look at those guys.
They're college guys, frat guys.

65
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,671
l think they're Zeta Pis...

66
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,269
...or KOK. l'm not really sure.

67
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,635
Come on, have fun.
What's wrong with you?

68
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,279
Look!

69
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,237
What are you doing?!

70
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,039
Just giving her a little makeover.

71
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,590
l want everybody
out of my house, right now!

72
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,113
Out!

73
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,316
Not me.

74
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,795
What's her fucking problem?

75
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,919
That's her dead mother's portrait,
you dumb-ass.

76
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,555
l'm sorry, Brit.
They're just assholes.

77
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,632
l messed up bad this time.

78
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,113
Why don't you marry a millionaire,
just like your dear, dead mother?

79
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,713
What the hell are you doing here?

80
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,394
Thought l'd write a story
for the school rag.

81
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,950
''Gator white trash makes good.''

82
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,032
-What you think?
-Don't you dare, you bitch.

83
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,473
So...

84
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,712
...tell me what your poor,
desperate, alcoholic mother...

85
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,190
...ever saw in booty-chasing
millionaire Niles Dunlap.

86
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,192
Why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

87
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,749
You may fool your
cardboard-cutout friends...

88
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,150
...but l still remember
where you came from.

89
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,993
You can take the girl
out of the trailer park...

90
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,789
...but you can't take the trailer park
out of the girl.

91
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,835
Out of my fucking house
before l call the police!

92
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,194
Trouble in paradise?

93
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,118
l'm not gonna say it again!

94
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,317
Out of my fucking house
before l call the police!

95
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,755
l said, now!

96
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,831
You. You can stay.

97
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,112
Great party, Mr. Dunlap.

98
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,597
This is not my fault. l didn't--

99
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,992
Well...

100
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,434
...that's trash.

101
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,679
Like mother, like daughter.

102
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,234
Green, baby.
You know what that is? Cash!

103
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,791
Cash! Everything around me!
You have my cash? Do you?

104
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,918
You remember me, right?
Bald head, tall, glasses.

105
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,071
<i>Where's my money?</i>

106
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,559
<i>What did l tell you?</i>

107
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,712
<i>What did l tell you?</i>
<i>You think you're a gambler?</i>

108
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,278
<i>A hundred.</i>

109
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,319
<i>Two hundred.</i>

110
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,559
<i>That's enough.</i>

111
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,358
<i>Look. Look at me.</i>

112
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,034
-Oh, my God!
-<i>l'll blow your fucking head off!</i>

113
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,237
Next time l'm here,
your whole family--

114
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,916
Niles?

115
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,476
What happened?

116
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,190
Nothing.

117
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,510
Who was that guy?

118
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,230
lt's none of your business, okay?

119
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,070
l'm leaving tomorrow,
and you pull this party shit?

120
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,432
How am l supposed
to trust you now?

121
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,678
l'm sorry, okay?

122
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,518
You can trust me, Dad.

123
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,316
Stepdad.

124
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,479
-You feeling okay?
-Yeah, it's just....

125
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,914
What's up?

126
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,594
There was just this guy
at the house last night.

127
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,957
-What happened?
-No, nothing like that.

128
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,599
What, then?

129
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,193
Just forget about it.

130
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,678
Tell me about the guy, Brit.

131
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,195
-Was it one of those cute frat guys?
-No.

132
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,112
Come on.

133
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,998
Tell me.

134
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,153
There was a man threatening Niles
with a gun.

135
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,673
Seriously?

136
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,435
Jesus.

137
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,750
When l asked Niles about it...

138
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,878
...all he did was give me shit
about the party.

139
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,951
l'm sorry.

140
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,839
What are you gonna do?

141
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,550
l don't want to talk about this
right now. Let's go to practice.

142
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,398
Hey, Brit. Brit.

143
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,558
Principal's looking for you.

144
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,676
Call you back.

145
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,954
Brittney.

146
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,718
What is it?

147
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,678
Maybe you'd better sit down.

148
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,673
Last time you asked me to do that,
my mother was dead.

149
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,757
There's been an accident.

150
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,355
No.

151
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,478
No, not again.

152
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,755
Afternoon, detective.

153
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,670
lnsurance investigator. Great.

154
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,116
Any word on what caused the crash,
if you don't mind me asking?

155
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,554
You know what? l do mind.

156
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,117
We're on the same team.
We're both looking for answers.

157
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,158
No, we're not. l'm looking
to wrap this up and go home.

158
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,630
-You're looking to find trouble.
-l'm just trying to do my job.

159
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,236
Oh, yeah? What's your job?
Scratch a wound till it bleeds?

160
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,110
What happened here
is the guy took on gravity and he lost.

161
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,430
That simple enough for you?

162
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,114
Nothing is ever as simple
as it appears.

163
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,793
Hey, look around you, pal.

164
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,758
This is a police investigation.
You don't belong here.

165
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,515
So pay that girl her check and go back
to wherever you came from.

166
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,511
Detective.

167
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,238
What do you got?

168
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,510
-Looks like swamp rats.
-They probably went in after the body.

169
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,591
Excuse me.

170
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,556
You ever hear of a rat running
into a burning airplane?

171
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,431
l'm sorry to be bothering you.

172
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,516
-l know this isn't an easy time for you.
-Something wrong?

173
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,879
We....

174
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,999
We found rats in the fuselage
of Niles' airplane.

175
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,073
-They'd chewed through the wiring.
-Are you serious?

176
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,470
Like somebody put them there
on purpose.

177
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,279
You know anybody
who may have been angry...

178
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,716
...or had a grudge
against your stepfather?

179
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,032
Hey, Brit. What about that guy
you told me about?

180
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,872
The one that threatened Niles.

181
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,838
Wanna tell me something?

182
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,908
<i>What did l tell you?</i>
<i>You think you're a gambler?</i>

183
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,672
<i>A hundred.</i>

184
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,354
<i>Two hundred.</i>

185
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,154
<i>That's enough.</i>

186
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,358
<i>Look at me. l'm gonna fucking--</i>

187
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,512
l'm gonna have to take that tape.

188
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,112
According to Mr. Dunlap's will, Miss
Havers shall be furnished a stipend...

189
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,999
...until she graduates
from a college of her choice.

190
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,720
After that, she'll be provided
with a small trust.

191
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,839
-How small are we talking?
-$25,000 a year for life.

192
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,153
$25,000 a year?

193
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,908
What about controlling interest
in the company?

194
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,833
His 51 percent will revert
to the corporate trust...

195
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,278
...of which the board will supervise,
subject to the provisions of the will.

196
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,035
There must be some kind of mistake.

197
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,191
l'm afraid not, Miss Havers.

198
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,793
What were the provisions?

199
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,236
That the money would go
to a blood heir, if Mr. Dunlap had one.

200
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,868
Otherwise, the trust
is to donate the money...

201
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,838
...to Mr. Dunlap's
favourite country club.

202
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,877
This is bullshit. What--?

203
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,395
These are your stepfather's
last wishes.

204
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,154
ls there any other money?

205
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,915
Mr. Dunlap took out a $2 million
life-insurance policy last year.

206
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,631
But with no heir, l'm afraid
that also reverts to the trust.

207
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,555
So $25,000 a year. That's it?

208
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,996
A lot of people live very well
on $25,000 a year.

209
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,310
ln the Glades, maybe.

210
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,713
We'll have the papers ready for you
to sign in front of the judge tomorrow.

211
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,557
-Term National.
-<i>lt's me.</i>

212
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,837
Well, how's life in Blue Bay
with the rich and shameless?

213
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,797
Same shit, different day.

214
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,349
Listen, Lacey,
l need you to do me a favour.

215
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,398
Give me everything you can
on Niles Dunlap. Hire a Pl.

216
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,516
<i>l want the good,</i>
<i>the bad, the ugly.</i>

217
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,071
-Where are you going with all this, T.?
-l smell a rat.

218
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,674
What up, boss?

219
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,910
Thought you fulfilled
your weekly hours.

220
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,958
Got another angle
on the Brittney Havers story.

221
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,673
This shit ain't gonna sell.

222
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,831
You need to think sensational.

223
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,437
That's what l'm talking about.

224
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,080
That's kind of disrespectful
to Brittney.

225
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,676
What the hell do l care?
Fuck her if she can't take a joke.

226
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,389
But with the will, l'm sure she
doesn't need any more bad news.

227
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,039
What about the will?

228
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,351
l heard she lost out on everything
except 25 grand a year.

229
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,034
All his money's going
to the country club...

230
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,998
...unless they can find
a blood relative.

231
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,879
Damn. That fucker must
have been worth a boat load.

232
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,315
Sixty-five mil, according to <i>Forbes</i>.

233
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,119
Honey, you need to get out more.

234
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,958
Perfect.

235
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,993
Let's see what we got here.

236
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,194
l'm afraid there's not much
we can do for the little fella.

237
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,555
l didn't think so, doctor.

238
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,157
What l need here
is some information.

239
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,515
What kind of information?

240
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,352
Where did this thing come from?

241
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,672
Why was it found in the control panel
of a downed airplane?

242
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,960
-You really loved this rat, didn't you?
-lndeed. This could be worth 2 million.

243
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,839
Okay, l'll run some tests.

244
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,276
-l really appreciate this. Thanks.
-Sure, buddy.

245
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,752
Yeah, you rat.

246
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,714
Crime figures are down
for one reason only.

247
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,111
Hard work and dedication
of men and women of this department.

248
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,477
Excuse me. l'm in the middle
of this dog and pony show.

249
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,914
-We got it.
-What?

250
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,958
The guy from the security tape.
Fax came from Miami P.D.

251
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,556
Small-time hood runs backroom
gambling joints for the Cuban Mafia.

252
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,278
l'll call you back.

253
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,790
There she is!

254
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,754
Everything's fine, Brittney.
Come on.

255
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,718
-What's going on?
-There's a wrinkle in Dunlap's will.

256
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,869
What do you mean?

257
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,918
The clause about a blood relative
getting the money.

258
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,513
Come on, make some room.

259
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,035
Back off.
She doesn't have a comment.

260
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,633
No, she is lying!

261
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,031
Order! l will not tolerate
another outburst in my courtroom.

262
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,036
l understand that this is hard for you,
but you will respect this process.

263
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,550
Now, Miss King,
will you please continue.

264
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,953
Like l said,
Niles Dunlap was my father.

265
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,830
You lying little bitch!

266
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,233
Order in the court! Order!

267
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,674
Order! Order!

268
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,556
Court's adjourned.

269
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,191
We'll try again tomorrow,
with a little more decorum, perhaps.

270
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,793
-Bridge.
-lt's me.

271
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,997
-<i>You're working late.</i>
-You got Cragen's panties in a bunch.

272
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,674
He's scared you'll lose
out on a big payout.

273
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,832
You tell him not to worry.
Bridge will bring this home.

274
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,399
<i>What you got on Dunlap?</i>

275
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,314
Okay. Married three times.
Twice divorced.

276
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,109
Brittney's mother was the last wife.
Committed suicide a year ago.

277
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,599
lt was real nasty too.

278
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,228
Took a long car ride
off a very short jetty.

279
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,235
She'd found out about his reputation
with the ladies.

280
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,674
What kind of reputation?

281
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,070
He's seen more pussy
than an animal shelter.

282
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,832
l love it when you talk dirty.

283
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,073
Had a world-famous wine collection
in the cellar of his $1 0 million mansion.

284
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,630
l wouldn't expect anything less
from a corporate tyrant.

285
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,916
-That it?
-l always have more for you, T.

286
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,957
He was also a big-time gambler.

287
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,875
Seedy backrooms in Miami, as well as
legit tables in Biloxi and Atlantic City.

288
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,555
Wouldn't bat an eyelid at dropping
a mil or two. He was compulsive.

289
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,748
<i>He learned to fly so he could squeeze</i>
<i>in a little more time at the tables.</i>

290
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,311
Even taught stepdaughter Brittney to
fly so he could down a cocktail or two.

291
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,152
Very interesting.

292
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,629
l overnighted
Dunlap's medical records.

293
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,793
Thanks, Lacey.
You're the best.

294
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,679
<i>--where high-school student</i>
<i>Maya King came forward...</i>

295
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,549
<i>... claiming to be the illegitimate</i>
<i>daughter of Niles Dunlap.</i>

296
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,474
<i>The room exploded in chaos</i>
<i>when Brittney Havers...</i>

297
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,029
<i>...attacked Miss King</i>
<i>upon hearing the news.</i>

298
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,031
<i>Bailiffs restrained Miss Havers...</i>

299
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,875
<i>...before the judge ordered the court</i>
<i>adjourned for the day.</i>

300
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,600
Plot thickens.

301
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,874
-And these are?
-Letters, Your Honour.

302
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,157
-From Mr. Dunlap to my mother.
-Love letters?

303
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,675
No, l wouldn't call them that.

304
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,115
Tell me about them.
When were they written?

305
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,317
After l was born. Summer of '84.

306
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,709
My mother worked
in the Dunlap mansion.

307
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,678
One of her three jobs.

308
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,393
For the first month,
he didn't even talk to her.

309
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,711
lgnored her like she was
a piece of trash.

310
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,758
But then one evening,
that all changed.

311
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,515
Suddenly he was all over her
like a rash.

312
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,550
A few weeks later,
she exploded the myth...

313
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,030
...you can't get pregnant
your first time.

314
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,795
The very same day he fired her,
he cut her a check...

315
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,793
...gave her the name of a doctor
he wanted her to see.

316
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,080
Needless to say, she didn't know what
he wanted her to do with the money.

317
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,880
How could he not see the crucifix
around her neck?

318
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,635
This is an outrage! We're dragging
a respected man through the mud...

319
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,951
...based on the testimony
of a less than reliable witness.

320
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,954
l will not tolerate
any more interruptions!

321
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,078
-Miss King.
-l'm sorry.

322
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,435
lt's just--

323
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,280
lt still hurts to think about.

324
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,956
Mom put me in foster homes
when she needed to save money.

325
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,074
l haven't spoken to her
in a couple of years.

326
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,630
Last l heard,
she moved to Puerto Rico.

327
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,749
l went through her personal stuff
after she skipped town...

328
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,070
...and that's
when l found those letters.

329
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,400
All from Niles.

330
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,956
All threatening her...

331
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,395
...if she revealed
that he was my father.

332
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,599
Order!

333
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,514
Order!

334
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,432
Miss King.

335
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,239
You'll be required to submit
to a DNA test...

336
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,039
...which will be matched
to the late Mr. Dunlap.

337
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,192
-Really?
-The results will be back in two days.

338
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,399
At which time this court
will make a final ruling.

339
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,478
Court dismissed.

340
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,711
There you go.

341
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,278
-Thanks.
-Let's go.

342
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,955
Now, what do we have here?

343
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,398
Niles Dunlap,
exhumation for DNA testing.

344
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,833
That's a killer.

345
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,077
-Cancer sticks.
-Everybody dies, believe me.

346
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,629
-l'm sorry, l didn't catch your name.
-Terence. Terence Bridge.

347
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,950
Term National Life lnsurance.

348
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,635
Well, Mr. Dunlap must be
an important client of yours, huh?

349
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,031
He was.
l wrote the policy myself.

350
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,317
Now l'm on the hook for 2 million.

351
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,358
lt's gotta be a pain in the ass
for you, this whole mess.

352
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,272
lt's no big deal.

353
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,560
When you finish doing the DNA, could
you give me a call? Let me know?

354
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,436
-You'll be the first to know.
-Great.

355
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,512
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l gotta open this up.

356
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,114
l appreciate your help.

357
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,951
See you when l see you.

358
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,275
Yeah.

359
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,638
You sure you don't want
some company tonight?

360
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,279
No. l just need some time to think.

361
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,870
Bye.

362
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,350
You want to dance with me, baby?

363
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,431
-You want to dance?
-What do you want?

364
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,354
-What l'm owed, <i>mija</i>. What l'm owed.
-l don't owe you anything.

365
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,274
Seven fucking million dollars.
That debt don't die with him!

366
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,830
Look at me.

367
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,157
Three days, l'll be back, <i>mija</i>.

368
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,153
And you don't want
to fuck with me, <i>muchacha</i>.

369
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,199
Cicatriz.

370
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,828
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth?

371
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,433
l do.

372
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,955
Dr. Haynes, have you completed
the DNA tests?

373
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,430
-Yes, Your Honour.
-Let me see them.

374
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,516
And are you satisfied
with these results?

375
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,997
-Yes, Your Honour.
-Very well.

376
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,192
The transcription reads as follows:

377
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,749
''The DNA taken from the person
of Maya King...

378
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,236
...and checked against that
of Niles Dunlap...

379
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,989
...is a genetic match.

380
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,429
lt is the opinion
of the coroner's office...

381
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,149
...that Niles Dunlap is indeed
the blood father of Maya King.''

382
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,829
As per the will, Mr. Dunlap's
51 percent controlling interest...

383
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,596
...in the Dunlap Corporation
goes to Miss Maya King.

384
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,956
Court adjourned.

385
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,119
<i>Miss Havers was led away</i>
<i>in tears after the ruling.</i>

386
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,795
<i>Miss King stands to inherit</i>
<i>the shares of the Dunlap Corporation...</i>

387
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,394
<i>... valued at approximately</i>
<i>$ 70 million.</i>

388

<i>was detained here...</i>

389
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,309
<i>... on suspicion of murder</i>
<i>in the crash of Niles Dunlap.</i>

390
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,990
<i>Thank you, Linda. Mr. Cicatriz</i>
<i>was taken into custody today...</i>

391
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,835
<i>...at his home in Valley View. No word</i>
<i>yet on what specific charges....</i>

392
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,592
They got him.

393
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,840
Christ, Mr. Bridge,
don't you ever sleep?

394
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,468
l did, once. lt's overrated.

395
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,756
Well, come in if you're coming in.

396
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,428
What did you find out
about our rodent friend?

397
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,034
A few bits and pieces.
l'll tell you one thing.

398
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,078
-That was no ordinary swamp rat.
-What do you mean?

399
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,432
Wasn't quite sure myself,
so l ran some tests.

400
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,716
l love rats. They're amazing.

401
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,714
They can survive a five-story fall,
swim for six hours...

402
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,634
...crawl though a hole size
of a quarter. Scavengers.

403
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,236
But not this guy. He wasn't settling
for scraps of garbage.

404
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,119
He had a taste
for the finer things in life.

405
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,430
-Like what?
-Like this.

406
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,037
Cork fragment. l found it
in its stomach with mould residue.

407
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,112
-Mould residue?
-From an expensive bottle of wine.

408
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,278
l'd say at least 20 years old.

409
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,959
Trendy rat.

410
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,679
Yeah.

411
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,198
l think it's time to celebrate.

412
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,033
Oh, shit.

413
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,078
Why don't you just kill
those fucking things?

414
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,750
That's a $2000 bottle of wine.

415
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,074
You know l'm good for it.

416
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,309
-We did it.
-We did it, didn't we?

417
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,436
l saw they arrested the Cuban guy...

418
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,989
...and they're charging him
with Niles' murder.

419
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,835
See? What did l tell you?

420
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,757
That cop just wants all his cases
tied up in a pretty little bow.

421
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,236
Nothing's over until it's over.

422
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,590
We haven't even sold
the company shares yet.

423
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,036
Nothing's foolproof, girls.

424
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,919
Quit worrying.

425
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,914
This is the last time we'll be together
before the money's in the bank.

426
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,799
Let's make the most of it.

427
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,310
Come here.

428
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,668
Now kiss him.

429
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,399
Beautiful, but deadly.

430
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,392
Do l know you?

431
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,513
The name's Terence Bridge.

432
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,234
l'm handling your stepfather's
insurance claim.

433
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,639
lf you're talking
about Niles' $2 million policy...

434
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,189
...you're talking to the wrong person.

435
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,238
The melaleuca tree.

436
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,832
Beautiful to look at...

437
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,790
...but all it does is suck up the water
around it until nothing is left.

438
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,191
Everything dies around them.

439
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,270
Really? That's fascinating.

440
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,519
You know they found rats
in your stepfather's plane.

441
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,798
Detective Morrison told me.

442
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,394
Now, if you'll excuse me.

443
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,511
Rough night last night, huh?

444
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,989
Few too many drinks?

445
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,831
Must be tough to know
when to stop...

446
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,719
...when you have the most extensive
wine collection.

447
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,916
What's your point?

448
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,718
Just learned a long time ago...

449
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,917
...when something doesn't add up,
you seek out the oddity.

450
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,354
Good luck with that.

451
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,875
Do you happen to have
a rodent problem?

452
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,389
Just you.

453
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,678
Who the hell does she think she is?
That's Brittney's spot.

454
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,678
Hey, you're parked
in Brittney's spot.

455
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,518
Haven't you heard? She's out.

456
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,511
l'm in.

457
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,240
So can l join your little Nazi
fashion clique now?

458
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,476
You're trash.

459
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,558
You always have been,
and you always will be.

460
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,639
Dyke.

461
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,233
Maya.

462
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,039
What the fuck are you doing here?
lf somebody sees us--

463
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,191
Come here.

464
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,075
-What is it?
-The insurance guy, Bridge...

465
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,073
...was asking me
about wine collections and rats.

466
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,514
-And rats!
-So?

467
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,632
-He knows. He fucking knows!
-Don't be so paranoid.

468
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,109
The insurance creep is
on the hook for 2 mil.

469
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,350
He doesn't care
about anything else.

470
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,835
-lf he goes to the police?
-He has nothing.

471
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,390
What if the Cuban guy gets out
of prison? He'll come after me.

472
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,637
-He'll come after me.
-Don't sweat your pretty little head.

473
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,518
l'll take care of you.

474
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,399
-We're in the clear.
-Maybe.

475
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,397
l want to fuck you so bad.

476
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,113
ls this a bad time, doctor?

477
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,510
Jesus, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

478
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,114
Well, we're in the right place for that.

479
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,874
What's on your mind, Mr. Bridge?

480
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,472
Niles Dunlap's medical record.

481
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,039
The man was 50 years old and more
physically fit than a man half his age.

482
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,997
Yeah.

483
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,989
A strong heart, low cholesterol.

484
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,720
ln fact, aside from some bouts
with chicken pox...

485
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,595
...and scarlet fever as a child,
his medical record is unblemished.

486
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,438
That's good for him.

487
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,593
Doesn't help him now that he's toast,
but good for him.

488
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,637
Just out of curiosity, what are
the long-term effects of scarlet fever?

489
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,314
That depends on the severity
of the infection.

490
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,677
lf it was real bad,
it could cause a heart murmur...

491
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,869
...or sometimes eye or ear damage.

492
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,509
Or sterility.

493
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,954
Sometimes.

494
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,999
Now, what if,
and this is just a ''what if'' ...

495
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,311
...Niles Dunlap was sterile?

496
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,919
Well, that's impossible.

497
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,631
-You see, Miss King proved that--
-l know. l know, l know.

498
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,197
The DNA was a perfect match.

499
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,436
You ran the test yourself.

500
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,953
Right.

501
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,033
But it would throw a real monkey
wrench into the works, wouldn't it?

502
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,878
Wouldn't it?

503
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,395
lf he was sterile?

504
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,919
Sorry, l don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

505
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,350
lf you think of anything
you can tell me...

506
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,990
-...just call me day or night. All right?
-Great.

507
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,074
Harvard man, l see.

508
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,319
Yeah. l--

509
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,318
l went to Morehouse.

510
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,233
But l'm just trying to figure out...

511
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,154
...how a big-time education at Harvard
can land someone like yourself...

512
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,915
...at some small-town coroner's job.

513
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,275
Just seems odd.

514
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,269
See you when l see you.

515
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,997
Yeah.

516
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,154
What are you doing here?

517
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,312
That insurance agent's crawling
up my fucking ass.

518
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,870
Get the fuck in the house.
Let's go. Come on!

519
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,755
You fucking idiot, let's go.
Get in the fucking house. Damn it.

520
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,710
lf he could prove anything, he wouldn't
be an insurance agent, would he?

521
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,519
He's just fucking with you,
see if you'll crack.

522
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,671
Crack?

523
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,672
-l don't think l'll get through this.
-Yes, you will.

524
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,152
Just think about the 7 0 million.

525
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,669
And this.

526
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,394
So how did you do it, Maya?

527
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,677
How did you get the DNA to match?

528
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,389
What the fuck you doing here?

529
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,514
l was just looking
for Maya King's place.

530
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,238
Well, you're looking at it.

531
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,834
l know. l was--

532
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,672
Look, man, l'm an insurance...

533
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,791
...agent.

534
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,675
Hey, whoa, just take it easy, okay?

535
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,995
l'm just trying to give you
my business card.

536
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,070
Here.

537
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,870
Want some light?

538
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,277
All right.

539
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,038
Here.

540
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,679
What do you want with her?

541
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,910
Well, you know, she stands to inherit
a large sum of money.

542
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,031
From Bobby Santiago?

543
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,236
l very much fucking doubt that.

544
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,238
Bobby who?

545
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,913
Her father.

546
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,240
Probably. You never can tell.

547
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,710
Hung around here
when he wasn't doing time.

548
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,396
Died on the business end of a pig
sticker in Tallahassee a year back.

549
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,515
Really sorry to hear that.

550
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,399
You wouldn't happen to know
where he would be buried?

551
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,269
County dumped his box in the ground
out at Sapienza Hill.

552
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,074
Sapienza Hill.

553
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,753
-Hello?
-<i>Fucking Julian.</i>

554
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,638
Maya, what's wrong?

555
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,116
He's losing it. That insurance
investigator's nosing around...

556
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,714
...and Julian can't take
the fucking heat.

557
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,075
He wouldn't do anything stupid,
would he?

558
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,271
Abso-fucking-lutely.

559
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,590
We gotta deal with him.

560
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,512
What do you mean, ''deal with him''?

561
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,757
What do you think?
We never planned on cutting him in.

562
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,315
Let's think about this
before we do anything.

563
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,232
Don't think, Brit.

564
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,076
Just sit there and look pretty,
and we'll be together forever.

565
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,995
Papa King.

566
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,395
All right, Miss King, if we can get
your signature here.

567
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,471
And...

568
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,475
...here.

569
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,677
All right.

570
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,677
All right?

571
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,199
We're finished here.

572
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,518
That's it?

573
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,794
Seventy million dollars.

574
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,239
Seventy fucking million dollars!

575
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,670
Yes!

576
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,032
Sixty-nine million, 427 thousand,
to be exact.

577
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,636
Now, you're sure you don't wanna
transfer this to an account?

578
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,314
No, thank you.

579
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,870
A company check will do just fine.

580
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,752
-Hello?
-<i>lt's don</i>e.

581
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,952
Seventy million big ones.
l got the check in my hand.

582
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,797
All right. All right, calm down.
We still got shit to do.

583
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,434
We meet Julian at midnight.
You know where.

584
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,272
l've been thinking about this--

585
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,876
No. No, you're not.
We stick to the plan.

586
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,314
Damn it.

587
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,475
So you have something
to hide after all, huh?

588
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,834
Maya?

589
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,753
Maya?

590
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,795
Look, don't fuck around
with me right now, please.

591
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,791
Maya?

592
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,953
Shit! What the fuck is wrong
with you?

593
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,433
Glad you could make it, Brit.

594
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,471
Let's go.

595
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,711
You're such a puss.

596
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,031
Remember when we came here
with Andy and his brother Ross?

597
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,589
We need to talk.
He does not deserve this.

598
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,910
-The plan's a mistake.
-No, it's not.

599
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,912
-Knock it off.
-Did l scare you? Oh, pumpkin.

600
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,913
-What is wrong with you?
-lt's not gonna bite you.

601
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,913
Come on. Let me show you something.
Let me show you...

602
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,390
...how to use it.
Come on, put your hand on it.

603
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,315
Hold on to that and open it up.

604
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,038
Good.

605
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,033
Now, l want you to...

606
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,350
...gently put them in.

607
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,989
Slowly.

608
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,877
Slide them all the way down.

609
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,518
That's it.

610
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,989
Slowly.

611
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,995
Then close it up.

612
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,394
And raise it all the way up.

613
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,439
Now, all you have to do...

614
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,273
-...is squeeze.
-Can l join in?

615
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,071
Fuck!

616
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,510
-Maya!
-Fuck!

617
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,829
Maya!

618
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,433
No! No! Don't do this!

619
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,433
lt's already done!
Now, go find his junkie ass.

620
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,989
l'm gonna double back.

621
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,112
Julian! l don't want to hurt you.
Please, come out and let me explain.

622
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,316
Come on, Julian.

623
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,994
We just want to talk.

624
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,675
Julian?

625
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,388
Julian, it doesn't have
to end this way.

626
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,830
How did you think it was going
to end, huh?

627
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,070
With all of us living together happily?

628
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,310
Moving to Utah, raising chickens?

629
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,038
No.

630
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,395
lt's gonna be me or you.

631
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,995
Bitch.

632
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,911
Hold this.

633
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,275
Hold it!

634
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,630
We're never gonna get away
with this.

635
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,519
Think happy thoughts, Brit.

636
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,837
-Well, where are we gonna take him?
-Where do you think?

637
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,797
No.

638
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,633
No, not there.

639
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,314
They never found your mom,
did they?

640
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,438
Her suicide inspires
our perfect murder.

641
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,989
At least she didn't die in vain.

642
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,515
-Where's Dr. Haynes?
-He called in sick today.

643
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,671
Oh, really?

644
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,198
So, what would it take
to see Niles Dunlap's body?

645
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,430
A miracle. Mr. Dunlap's body was
released for cremation this afternoon.

646
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,716
On whose authority?

647
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,791
His daughter, Maya King.

648
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,270
Of course.

649
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,392
Of course.

650
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,675
What's Dr. Haynes' home address?

651
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,274
Brittney, grab a leg.

652
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,955
We gotta get him in the water.
Come on. Brittney!

653
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,360
-Shit.
-Come on, let's go.

654
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,794
-Holy shit!
-Oh, shit.

655
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,030
Oh, my God, we are fucked!
We are fucked!

656
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,317
-What are we gonna do?
-Calm down, Brittney!

657
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,988
Pull yourself together.
Take care of that thing.

658
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,594
l'll stall him.

659
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,038
Hi.

660
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,634
What in God's name
are you doing out here?

661
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,236
-Don't you know Gator Alley ain't safe?
-Yeah.

662
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,516
l was just out here
with some friends...

663
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,911
...and they kind of ditched me.
So l tried to start my car.

664
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,629
lt wouldn't start.
Just making my way back to town.

665
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,119
Town?

666
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,669
Little lady, town is
in the opposite direction.

667
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,359
What the hell was that?

668
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,993
l didn't hear anything.

669
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,433
All right, missy, you get
in the back seat of the car.

670
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,036
Come on, get in the back seat
of the car. Move! Now!

671
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,676
Maybe you could just give me
a jump.

672
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,671
Fine.

673
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,671
Shit.

674
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,274
<i>Where are you?</i>

675
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,072
That was so fucking close.

676
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,554
lt's done.

677
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,553
Fucking better be.
Meet me at Julian's.

678
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,192
Shit. Shit.

679
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,869
Dr. Haynes?

680
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,668
Dr. Haynes?

681
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,111
Bridge, Bridge, Bridge.

682
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,430
This had better be good.

683
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,398
How'd you like a murder case
wrapped up nice...

684
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,118
...handed to you on a plate?

685
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,799
Murder, huh?

686
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,236
-Who?
-Dr. Julian Haynes.

687
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,713
Yeah?

688
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,677
<i>You okay?</i>

689
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,834
<i>You sure? You were kind of</i>
<i>freaking me out last night.</i>

690
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,235
l'm sure.

691
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,756
<i>Fine. We're on for tonight.</i>

692
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,230
<i>Make sure you're ready.</i>

693
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,908
Yeah, l already checked.

694
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,391
Nothing over here.

695
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,194
How long do you want us to stay
out here?

696
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,715
-There ain't nothing down here.
-Pack it up.

697
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,519
We're out of here.
Motherfucker.

698
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,673
You got any idea what this bullshit
cost the department today, huh?

699
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,193
What about Julian's body?

700
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,191
They killed him. He's in there.

701
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,158
The only thing in that swamp
is my fucking reputation.

702
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,275
Maybe the gators pinned him
under a log.

703
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,793
-l'm sure if--
-Sure what?

704
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,549
That my boss is gonna have my head
because of your bullshit?

705
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,472
You're done.
l'll make sure of it.

706
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,160
Now, get the fuck out of my county.

707
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,709
You eat well last night?

708
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,238
Well, l hope you had
a great fucking meal!

709
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,432
Because it cost me
my goddamn job!

710
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,550
This fucking sucks!

711
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,038
lt sucks.

712
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,314
The melaleuca sucks
everything around it.

713
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,318
Fuck.

714
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,156
Come on, come on.

715
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,352
Shit.

716
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,032
Brit!

717
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,712
-Brittney, come on, we gotta go.
-We can't go.

718
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,878
-Why not?
-l'm why not.

719
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,315
l need some more ice.

720
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,831
l gotta admit...

721
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,749
...it was a cool plan.

722
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,518
l'll give you that.

723
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,592
Using those pesky cellar rats
to take Niles' plane down...

724
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,995
...making it look like a Cuban hit.

725
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,751
Smart.

726
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,236
But not smart enough.

727
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,519
l called some local exterminators...

728
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,118
...and l found out all about Miss
Havers' well-documented rat problem.

729
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,837
And then, there's the little matter...

730
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,514
...of digging up
Maya's rotting father...

731
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,593
...and getting the coroner
to switch the bodies. Very sexy.

732
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,718
You didn't think about the fresh soil
you leave behind...

733
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,236
...digging up a body that's been buried
for a full year.

734
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,312
Not sexy.

735
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,878
And last, but not least...

736
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,079
...there's the junkie coroner.

737
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,310
Dear old Julian.

738
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,519
Now, that was a tough one.

739
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,397
What the fuck
are you talking about?

740
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,875
What am l talking about?

741
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,632
l'm talking about a beautiful tree...

742
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,156
...that does nothing but suck
up everything around it...

743
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,595
...till nothing's left.

744
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,474
And those roots, well,
they take in anything.

745
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,039
Even blood.

746
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,037
What do you want?

747
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,435
l want half the money.

748
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,200
-Fuck you!
-Bad choice.

749
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,671
Detective Morrison, please.

750
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,478
Yes, l'll hold.

751
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,398
Fine. Fuck! Fine!

752
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,594
You're in, okay?

753
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,194
Half the insurance money.

754
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,717
l think not.
l want half the score.

755
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,311
Thirty-five million.

756
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,193
Or Morrison will have
the easiest murder case ever.

757
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,914
Detective Morrison, Terence Bridge.
How you doing?

758
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,308
All right!

759
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,872
Half.

760
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:55,073
l just wanted to apologize
for this afternoon.

761
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,830
See you on the back nine.

762
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,712
No.

763
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,952
l'm not giving up my half.

764
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,874
Brittney. Brittney!

765
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,552
Fuck.

766
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,756
l'll take care of her.

767
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,629
So how long you been
in the insurance business?

768
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,637
Eleven years.

769
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,919
Eleven years, huh?

770
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,839
Must have been tempting.

771
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,952
Cut a deal, skim a little off the top.

772
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,430
-No, never.
-Never?

773
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,392
Really?

774
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,796
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>l find that hard to believe.</i>

775
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,111
lt's not your money.

776
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,912
What made you change your mind?

777
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,629
Eleven years of cutting checks
to assholes in wheelchairs...

778
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,156
...who later are dancing
a fucking jig in Maui.

779
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,119
Paying fortunes out to abused wives
whose husbands...

780
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:45,718
...inexplicably decide to take baths
with toasters, blow dryers.

781
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,518
Eleven years of living
out of a suitcase...

782
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,788
...watching the rich get richer.

783
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,079
And a boss who's just been looking
for a reason to fire my ass.

784
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,028
So this is payback time.

785
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,514
Oh, yeah.

786
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,911
Yeah, that's right.

787
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,433
For all the years
l've played by the book.

788
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,596
Now it's time for old Bridge
to get what's coming to him.

789
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,429
lt's so nice to finally meet somebody
who can play my game.

790
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,392
Do it.

791
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,317
Please.

792
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,314
You don't--
You don't have to do this.

793
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,313
l'm--
l was--

794
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,472
You just--

795
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,438
-Come on, man.
-You want half the money?

796
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,715
Then you earn it.

797
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,272
Okay.

798
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,511
Where the hell have you been?

799
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:23,275
-Getting her shit together.
-Well, we could take her to Gator Alley.

800
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,273
No way the police is gonna check
that place again.

801
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,235
Just act natural.

802
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,711
Nothing's wrong.

803
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,950
Nothing's wrong.

804
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,236
We're cool. We're cool.

805
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,276
What the hell are you doing?

806
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,512
Stop me.
l dare you.

807
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,355
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

808
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,112
Fuck!

809
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,157
Double-crossing fucking--

810
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:16,515
Yes, there's a beige Buick LeSabre,
license plate 2-8-8-A-J-H...

811
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:21,196
...driving around downtown Blue Bay
with a dead girl in the trunk.

812
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,319
<i>-Did you say a dead girl in the trunk?</i>
-Yes, that's right.

813
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,871
-Morning, Miss Havers.
-ls it ready?

814
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,555
lt took a little while
to put it all together, but it'll work.

815
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,993
l need to talk to Detective Morrison.

816
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,230
l didn't kill her, Brittney Havers did.

817
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,676
We can't find Brittney Havers.
Maybe you killed her too.

818
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,230
You guys are wasting
precious time, man.

819
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,517
You need to be at the bus depots,
car rentals, the airports.

820
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,673
-We already checked. She wasn't there.
-What do you mean she wasn't there?

821
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,951
Goddamn it.

822
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,113
She doesn't need to buy a plane ticket
because she already knows how to fly.

823
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,678
We are out of here!

824
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,749
She's probably halfway
to the Cayman lslands by now.

825
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,718
-Laughing all the way to the bank.
-Turn to the left.

826
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,678
Oh, boy, she played me
like a punk-ass bitch.

827
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,592
That skank.

828
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,992
Turn to the right.

829
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,038
Oh, l'm the fall guy now?
ls that what it is, Brittney?

830
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,556
You just gonna disappear and leave me
hanging with all this shit.

831
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,795
Don't you see what's going on, man?
She killed all of them.

832
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,157
You know, she killed all of them!
lt's as simple as that!

833
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,471
Nothing is ever as simple
as it appears.

834
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,390
lsn't that what you said, Bridge?

835
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,310
-lt is when it's the truth.
-Sure it is.

836
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,635
Well, the truth is we found this
in the trunk of your car.

837
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,030
Right next to the dead girl.

838
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,272
Looks like it came
from the Dunlap's security system.

839
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,832
<i>What do you want?</i>

840
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,270
<i>l want half the money.</i>

841
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,112
<i>Fuck you.</i>

842
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,474
<i>Bad choice.</i>

843
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,272
All right.

844
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,795
l got a little greedy.

845
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,151
-But l didn't kill Maya, Brittney did.
-Jesus Christ.

846
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,670
She must have erased the rest
of the tape or something.

847
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,952
<i>The FBl raided the Dunlap mansion</i>
<i>based on testimony...</i>

848
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,874
<i>... of a Cuban national arrested in</i>
<i>the suspected murder of Niles Dunlap.</i>

849
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,113
<i>Early reports show that records seized</i>
<i>indicate Mr. Dunlap misappropriated...</i>

850
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,794
<i>...millions of dollars</i>

851
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,036
<i>... to finance a gambling addiction.</i>

852
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,918
<i>Turning now to entertainment...</i>

853
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,231
<i>... concert pianist Benjamin Koskert</i>
<i>continues to wow--</i>

854
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,911
He's not dead.

855
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,716
-He's not dead.
-Oh, come on.

856
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,269
Niles Dunlap is not fucking dead.

857
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,434
He knew his corporate balls was gonna
be in a sling and he set this thing up.

858
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,989
You killed a little girl,
you piece of shit!

859
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,197
They're gonna love you
in general population. Get him out.

860
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,389
You couldn't find your dick
if they put it in your fucking hand!

861
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,513
ln your fucking hand!
You won't do this, Morrison!

You can't do this, man!
Don't do this, please!

863
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,235
Don't do this!

864
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,912
Jesus, Brit.

865
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,674
What are you trying to do, kill me?

866
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,714
lt's just a little turbulence.
lt'll be smooth sailing from here on out.

867
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,711
lt sure will.

868
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,956
l'll tell you, greed,
it'll do it to you every time.

869
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,119
Poor old Mr. Bridge.

870
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,472
You had him figured out the moment
you laid those pretty eyes on him, huh?

871
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,437
-You ready?
-You betcha.

872
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,039
-You got an airboat waiting for us?
-Yeah, it's all taken care of.

873
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,633
Don't worry about a thing.

874
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,434
What's the matter? You afraid l did
something when l packed your chute?

875
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,712
Maybe.

876
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,512
Take mine.

877
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,628
What are you worried about?
You're dead already.

878
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,596
You know, you and your mother,
you couldn't be more different.

879
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,598
l don't think she would have
ever had the brains...

880
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,469
...or the balls to pull off
something like this.

881
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,476
-Well, l learned it all from you.
-Bad influence, huh?

882
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,829
The worst.

883
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,911
Here we go!

884
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,272

in Blue Bay...

886
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,200
...and sorry you kept breaking
my mother's heart!

887
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,759
What are you talking about?

888
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,196
l'm sorry l packed your chute
with newspaper!

889
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,030
You wouldn't do that
to your own father!

890
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,798
Stepfather!

891
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,269
You should've taken the first one
