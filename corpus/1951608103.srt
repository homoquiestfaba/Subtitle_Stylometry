1
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,031
Another nightmare?

2
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,072
I'm okay.

3
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,275
We launch a new campaign next week.

4
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,004
The Japanese are flying in Tuesday.

5
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,206
<i>The Times, The Herald,
and The Post are all running pieces...</i>

6
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,509
which is very exciting.

7
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,756
Karen Baldwin's office. Please hold.

8
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,450
Karen Baldwin.

9
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,662
Okay.

10
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,103
Thank you.

11
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,042
I love you...

12
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,481
so much.

13
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,286
Me, too.

14
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,062
Always my favorite.

15
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,969
That's why I want you
to have the summer house.

16
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,376
The last time you were there...

17
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,917
was the summer I was in Europe
with Aunt Betty.

18
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,186
You were 13, I think.

19
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,297
Wendy was 11.

20
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,338
Your grandfather loved that house.

21
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,348
Especially when you girls were there.

22
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,610
<i>Clean it up...</i>

23
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,420
<i>sell it...</i>

24
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,353
<i>and get married.</i>

25
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,974
So, how long did your grandparents
live here for?

26
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,707
Oh, God. As long as I can remember.

27
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,579
I spent every summer there till I was 13.

28
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,476
That's a lot of memories.

29
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,423
What the hell is that?

30
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,471
What is it?

31
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,669
A deer.

32
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,063
- You get them?
- Got them.

33
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,979
Here we are.

34
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,817
- Got the key?
- Yeah.

35
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,149
Thanks.

36
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,163
Great.

37
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,780
Wow.

38
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,054
It's gonna take a little longer
than a weekend to clean it.

39
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,827
It's different than I remember it.

40
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,724
It used to seem so much bigger to me,
you know?

41
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,855
I know.

42
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,867
Actually used to get lost around there
all the time.

43
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,204
Spiders seem to like it.

44
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,143
This your grandfather?

45
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,173
Yeah.

46
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,595
Jeff?

47
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,433
Jeff!

48
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,737
- What?
- Rats!

49
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,074
- Where?
- God damn it, there are rats in there!

50
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,307
In the breadbox, there are rats!

51
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,079
God damn it!

52
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,285
Don't laugh at me! There are rats in there!

53
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,947
The most powerful woman in publicity.

54
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:54,323
- Shut up, it's not funny.
- Come on, it's just a couple of rats.

55
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,089
- Jeff.
- It's all right.

56
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,493
Don't laugh at me.

57
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,190
- Just a little rodent.
- They're so big.

58
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,358
- Great with garlic.
- Shut up.

59
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,700
Two rooms down and 11 to go.

60
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,069
Thank you for being here.

61
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,937
What else are boyfriends for?

62
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,493
You know what I was thinking?

63
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,326
Maybe I could stay a few more days.

64
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,172
You can't.

65
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,006
You have a new job, and I am fine.

66
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,869
I can handle it.
You need to stop worrying about me.

67
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,983
- If you think...
- I think.

68
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,694
Thank you.

69
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,156
You're welcome.

70
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,657
What is it?

71
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,523
Nothing.

72
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,922
Hey.

73
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,657
Let's relax, okay?

74
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,494
I'm relaxed.

75
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,796
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

76
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,823
Wait. Wait.

77
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,226
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

78
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,044
This was their room, you know?
And this was their bed. It's kind of weird.

79
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,546
Pick a room.

80
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,508
Any room at all.

81
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,861
- God damn it! Jeff!
- What? You were gone, I got worried.

82
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,470
God, you scared me.

83
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,106
You scared me, too.

84
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,640
- What were you doing?
- What was I doing?

85
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,943
Looking for my girl.
Besides, what are you doing?

86
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,432
Excuse me, your horse was...

87
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,633
Who are you?

88
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,840
I look after this place.

89
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,340
I don't know if anyone's told you yet...

90
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,541
but my grandmother just passed away.

91
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,445
She's dead? Shame.

92
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,149
We're packing up the place.
We're gonna sell it.

93
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,789
I see.

94
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,330
I had no idea
there were still horses around here.

95
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,460
Yep.

96
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,005
Do you take care of them, too?
I mean, the house, the horses...

97
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,165
It must be a lot of work.

98
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,038
Not if you like them.

99
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,704
You can tame them.
They know who's the boss.

100
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,413
And if they're gonna be ridden...

101
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,044
Well...

102
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,284
I fell off one once when I was younger.
Been kind of terrified of them ever since.

103
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,029
Well, you're not a little girl anymore,
are you?

104
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,429
Maybe it's time you ride again.

105
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,994
No. No, not for me. Thanks.

106
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,494
Afraid you're gonna fall?

107
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,736
Don't be afraid. I won't let it happen.

108
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,943
Go on, now.

109
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,280
I should... I'm gonna get back to packing.

110
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,645
- Name's Pierce.
- Karen.

111
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,083
I know.

112
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,128
Don't be a stranger, now.

113
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,163
Just some blown fuses.

114
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,243
What is this?

115
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,838
Where did that come from?

116
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,380
I think they got it in Italy
on their honeymoon.

117
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,380
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's really pretty.

118
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,048
Where are we going for our honeymoon?

119
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,760
Jeff...

120
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,641
I'm gonna go finish in the other room.

121
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,139
Do you have any masking tape?

122
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,308
You don't have to get married.

123
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,336
Sorry, I fell asleep.

124
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,564
Well, wake up.

125
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,257
What's wrong?

126
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,936
- I hate the idea of leaving you here.
- I'll be fine.

127
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,597
No, it's just...

128
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,743
That.

129
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,882
How about I promise...

130
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,718
that I will call you later?

131
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,195
- You better call me later.
- I will.

132
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,994
- I miss you already.
- Yeah, me, too.

133
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,270
Now go.

134
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,769
- Stop worrying about me. I'm fine.
- Okay.

135
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,006
- Okay?
- All right.

136
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,139
Okay.

137
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,322
Drive safely.

138
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,823
All righty.

139
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,161
Hello?

140
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,381
Is somebody there?

141
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,767
I got you. I got you, darling.

142
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,535
I won't let you fall. I won't let you fall.

143
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,373
You okay?

144
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,675
I won't let you fall.

145
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,647
I got you.

146
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,215
I won't let you fall.

147
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,942
Great.

148
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,641
Do you have a car?
A car, do you have a car?

149
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,111
- A car!
- No.

150
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,796
Damn it!

151
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,372
- Sorry. Shit. Sorry.
- It's okay.

152
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,373
It's broke.

153
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,572
It's okay, you're safe now. I'm here.

154
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,010
Are you all right?

155
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,082
I'll close the door, okay?

156
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,625
God, what is going on?

157
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:14,561
Hell if I know, I just heard screaming,
and I ran up there, it was raining women.

158
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,371
Yeah, I know...

159
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,972
it's modest...

160
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,916
but it's my home.

161
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,718
- Have you really been to all these places?
- No, don't. Please, don't.

162
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,785
I mean, they're mine.

163
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,455
It's sentimental.

164
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,734
Your hands are shaking.

165
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,430
Here, come on.

166
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,467
Why don't you sit down?

167
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,335
Here.

168
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,238
Drink this.

169
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,873
Thanks.

170
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,297
So, you didn't answer me before.

171
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,196
- You've really been to all those places?
- All of them.

172
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:27,963
Up here.

173
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,967
It's amazing where the mind will take you,
if you let it.

174
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,238
But...

175
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:40,547
you mean you've never actually
traveled anywhere?

176
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,217
Why? Just be disappointed.

177
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,125
It'd never be as good as my book.

178
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,425
Up here, it's always the way I want it.

179
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,324
People are nice...

180
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,190
warm beaches...

181
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,294
everything, you know? Happy endings.

182
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,337
Want to come with me?

183
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,742
You're tired. Why don't you...

184
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,979
You need to get some rest, anyway.
Come on.

185
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,073
Get in the bed.

186
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:17,316
- No, I'll take the couch.
- No, I sleep on the couch.

187
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,850
- What?
- I... Oh.

188
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,384
- I always sleep on the couch.
- Oh.

189
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,695
Then I'll take the bed.

190
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,259
Yeah.

191
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,796
Thanks.

192
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,836
Don't worry.

193
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,032
Horses will let you know
if anyone comes around, okay?

194
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,303
Thanks.

195
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,007
I have a boyfriend.

196
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,277
I know.

197
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,589
Just in case.

198
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,889
You never know. Okay?

199
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,326
All right.

200
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,235
Good night.

201
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,718
Hey.

202
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,021
Hey.

203
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,755
Sleep well?

204
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,763
Yeah. I did, actually. Thanks.

205
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,442
I don't know.

206
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,841
Maybe I'm just losing it.

207
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,145
Maybe I dreamed it, I don't know.
I mean, you saw, right?

208
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,914
When we went back into the house,
everything was fine.

209
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,846
Ain't nothing to fear...

210
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,722
But that big old horse.

211
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,759
He's nice.

212
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,202
Hey, what do you say
we go for a walk, huh?

213
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,264
Sure.

214
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,143
You behave.

215
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,607
Oh, your boot.

216
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,153
Ready?

217
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,466
I've never been out this far.

218
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,097
Really?

219
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,440
Yeah, my grandfather never let us.
He said it was too dangerous.

220
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,242
Really?

221
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,074
These woods are...

222
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:36,484
They're beautiful. Peaceful.

223
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,456
Nothing to be afraid of.

224
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,785
- You gonna miss this place?
- Of course.

225
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,989
But, you know,
the people, the places, who we love...

226
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,391
they're always with us.

227
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,455
Wow.

228
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,636
Look at that.

229
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,412
You okay?

230
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,586
Oh, my God.

231
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,089
You're making a habit of saving me, huh?

232
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,423
Yeah, looks like you had to be saved
from yourself, huh?

233
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,969
Let's go, come on. Come on.

234
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,554
You started without me.

235
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,123
Wendy! I can't believe you're here.

236
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,927
Oh, my God!

237
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,525
Oh, gosh.

238
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,499
Oh, honey!

239
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,967
- Hi.
- Hi.

240
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,806
- Wait, how did you get in?
- The front door.

241
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:05,931
Oh.

242
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,342
Gosh, it's crazy. It's just like I remember it.

243
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,680
Really? It seems so much smaller to me.

244
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,321
It is so good to see you.

245
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,389
Oh, look at that. Mom and Dad.

246
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,571
- I love that picture.
- They're so cute there.

247
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,575
No, look at this.
Were we, like, the cutest kids?

248
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,134
Oh, God, yeah.

249
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,075
Look at you here.

250
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,207
- That's not cute.
- No.

251
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,776
- Morning.
- Morning.

252
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,514
- Oh, Pierce, this is Wendy.
- Hi.

253
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:57,183
- My little sister.
- Really? Sisters.

254
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,990
Yeah, Pierce is the caretaker around here.

255
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,826
Oh, well, nice to meet you.

256
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,633
Oh. The pleasure's mine.

257
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,002
Would either of you like some breakfast?

258
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,198
- Oh, no, thanks. We're fine...
- Hey, speak for yourself.

259
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,976
- I would love some breakfast.
- I'd love to make you some.

260
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,371
Okay.

261
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,250
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

262
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,990
Where's your food? Aren't you gonna eat?

263
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:33,886
I already did.

264
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,839
Be careful with that one.

265
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,541
Why? Is he dangerous?

266
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,977
No, nothing like that, he's just...

267
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,976
Oh, I don't know.
There's just something about him.

268
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,315
- You're so overprotective.
- I know, I know.

269
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,878
Remember the summer
that I begged you to teach me how to kiss...

270
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,389
but you kept telling me no?

271
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,921
I had just met Joey,
and you told me I was too young.

272
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,824
Yeah.

273
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,060
I remember.

274
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,835
I remember that summer.

275
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,029
Oh, honey! God!

276
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,342
Come here, come here. Oh, God.

277
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,776
- Is it bad?
- Lean your head back.

278
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,369
- Oh.
- Lean your head back.

279
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:28,809
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

280
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,247
- Looking for you.
- For me?

281
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:31,306
For you.

282
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,411
Must be nice, you and your sister
together again...

283
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,957
- like you used to be.
- Yeah, like we used to be.

284
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,118
- Have a swing?
- Swing?

285
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:44,091
- Have a swing. What do you say?
- Okay.

286
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:50,199
- I'll push you.
- Yeah.

287
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,664
- Ready?
- Yeah.

288
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:52,864
Okay.

289
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,044
You're good at this.

290
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:08,576
Oh!

291
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,956
I got you.

292
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,955
- You okay?
- Yeah. You scared me.

293
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:21,430
I wouldn't have let you fall, honey.

294
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:34,906
Hey.

295
00:43:57,537 --> 00:44:00,199
- So this how you pick the wood, okay?
- Okay.

296
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:06,507
- Like that, like that.
- Okay.

297
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:08,712
And now you go...

298
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:12,882
- Okay. Okay.
- Easy.

299
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:17,114
- No, you go on first. I wanna watch you first.
- Okay.

300
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,117
With your left hand.

301
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,087
Okay.

302
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:26,298
- Okay, hold on. Let me get a good one.
- Okay.

303
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,832
- Is that one good?
- Hey.

304
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,061
- Hey.
- Hey.

305
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:31,434
- Show your sister what you can do.
- How's the packing going?

306
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,496
It's coming. I could use your help, though.

307
00:44:33,573 --> 00:44:35,803
Okay, hold on one second,
I wanna show you something.

308
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,343
Watch what your sister can do.

309
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:39,106
- You ready? Okay.
- Now.

310
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:42,574
Yeah!

311
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,686
- I think that was pretty good.
- Pretty good? It was great.

312
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:52,625
Okay, so I'm gonna go back up,
and you'll come up?

313
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:54,523
- Yeah, I'll be right up.
- Okay.

314
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:32,357
<i>- Wait, wait.
- No, I cannot find it. Let's go.</i>

315
00:45:32,432 --> 00:45:34,832
<i>Stop catching me.</i>

316
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,824
<i>Come on, Karen.</i>

317
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:02,627
<i>It's time to play.</i>

318
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:56,709
Remember, you're gonna tell me
whenever you need to go...

319
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:59,911
Go to the bathroom, blow my nose,
get a glass of water.

320
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:01,749
I'll keep you updated.

321
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:07,289
Look, I can't explain why.
It's just, I don't...

322
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,449
What?

323
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:10,896
I'm your sister. You can tell me anything.

324
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:14,422
No, it's nothing.
There's nothing to tell, it's just...

325
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:17,898
Look, it's for me, okay?
I'm a big scaredy-cat.

326
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:21,338
- I know that.
- So will you stay with me, just tonight?

327
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,935
- Like, in the bed with you?
- Yeah, like, right here.

328
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,544
And you promise not to hog all the covers?

329
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:29,639
I promise not to steal all the covers.

330
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:31,047
- Okay, I'm sold.
- You're sold?

331
00:47:31,117 --> 00:47:34,086
Yes, but you have to snuggle in,
because you're gonna take them...

332
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:37,180
and I'm gonna be, like, sleeping
on the other side of the bed with nothing.

333
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:39,691
- Come on, snuggle close.
- Spoon me.

334
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:44,132
Karen?

335
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,405
Karen, it's Wendy.

336
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:53,045
Karen, open the door.

337
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,485
Karen!

338
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:06,790
What's going on?

339
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:13,801
- They're getting so real.
- What is?

340
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:17,602
Karen, what are you talking about?

341
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:19,902
It was just a dream.

342
00:51:21,548 --> 00:51:23,072
Just a bad dream.

343
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:27,381
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

344
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:29,615
Oh, God.

345
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,624
God, look at you.

346
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:35,925
I'm okay.

347
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:42,023
What?

348
00:51:45,104 --> 00:51:47,265
Karen, hey, what?

349
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,240
Karen, what's going on?

350
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:11,892
I feel like we haven't done this in so long.

351
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:14,957
Just hang out
and play with each other's hair.

352
00:52:16,636 --> 00:52:19,002
I remember the first book I read
in this library.

353
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:20,664
<i>- Yeah?
- Snow White.</i>

354
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:24,067
I made Mom read me that book
so many times.

355
00:52:24,143 --> 00:52:26,270
Except she left out the part
of the evil queen...

356
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:27,677
because you got too scared.

357
00:52:27,747 --> 00:52:31,444
I would sneak the book under the covers
and read that part myself.

358
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:35,146
- Yeah, and then you cried yourself to sleep.
- I did not!

359
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:37,918
Okay, maybe a little bit.

360
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,128
I miss them.

361
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,594
I know.

362
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:03,977
You are such a brat.

363
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,485
You didn't!

364
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:16,123
- Stop it.
- That hurt me.

365
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:20,755
Hey.

366
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:24,403
Ready for that ride yet?

367
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:26,762
Go on, go.

368
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,329
Come on, one hour.

369
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:32,811
Still scared? I won't let you fall. Come on.

370
00:53:36,516 --> 00:53:39,713
Two, three, and up. There you go.

371
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:42,346
Now here, put these in your right hand.

372
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,548
Okay. Now, don't...

373
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:46,786
Hey, don't squeeze with your legs,
you hear me?

374
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:49,623
Don't squeeze with your legs,
and just relax.

375
00:53:49,696 --> 00:53:51,630
Don't fight it. Hang on.

376
00:53:52,165 --> 00:53:54,395
If you get afraid, you just grab here, okay?

377
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:57,334
And just enjoy the ride. All righty? Let's go.

378
00:53:58,304 --> 00:53:59,464
Come on.

379
00:54:01,975 --> 00:54:02,964
Come on.

380
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:05,536
Relax.

381
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:01,391
Wendy?

382
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,032
It's a dream.

383
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:11,870
It's a dream, it's a dream, it's a dream.

384
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:13,638
It's a dream.

385
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:27,418
<i>Karen.</i>

386
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:29,815
<i>Come on, Karen.</i>

387
00:56:33,993 --> 00:56:35,460
<i>It's time to play.</i>

388
00:56:39,065 --> 00:56:40,327
<i>Karen.</i>

389
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,534
<i>Oh, Karen.</i>

390
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:45,230
<i>It's time to play.</i>

391
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,349
<i>- Give it to me, you stupid...
- No! Stop it! It's my doll!</i>

392
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:12,652
<i>- Give it to me now.
- No, I don't want...</i>

393
00:58:12,725 --> 00:58:14,124
- Wendy, stop. Give it to me.
- No!

394
00:58:14,193 --> 00:58:16,024
- Karen, no! It's mine.
- Stop it. It's mine!

395
00:58:16,095 --> 00:58:17,426
- It's my favorite doll!
- It's mine!

396
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:19,020
No! Stop!

397
00:58:19,198 --> 00:58:20,790
- No, it's mine.
- Mine.

398
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:20,416
Waiting for a good pitch?

399
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:21,715
Whoa!

400
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:26,327
- Take it easy, slugger.
- How did you get in here?

401
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:29,890
Oh, I was just checking up on you.
Making sure you're okay. You okay?

402
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:31,795
Yeah?

403
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:53,281
No. No, no, no.

404
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,584
- No, no, no. Pierce, no, no, no.
- What?

405
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:57,094
- Wait, this is wrong.
- Why?

406
00:59:57,163 --> 01:00:00,064
No. No, no, no. No. No.

407
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,231
I said, quiet.

408
01:00:47,646 --> 01:00:49,546
I got you. I got you.

409
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:16,834
I got you. I got you, darling.

410
01:01:44,403 --> 01:01:45,734
I got you.

411
01:01:48,274 --> 01:01:50,606
Let's go. Get up.

412
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,745
Hey, I been reading some of the books
in the library.

413
01:01:57,383 --> 01:01:59,510
Read much history? Huh?

414
01:01:59,919 --> 01:02:04,117
It's good stuff.
I just read this one about a Doctor...

415
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:07,214
Josef Mengele.

416
01:02:08,294 --> 01:02:09,921
He was something.

417
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,527
Hey, come on.

418
01:02:13,299 --> 01:02:16,234
He was special.
He was a special kind of guy...

419
01:02:18,304 --> 01:02:21,967
and he saw himself as a scientist
more than as a doctor.

420
01:02:22,775 --> 01:02:26,370
He did these studies. With twins, you see.

421
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:27,972
He'd separate them.

422
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:30,106
He'd put one in a little room...

423
01:02:30,182 --> 01:02:31,945
and he'd have someone watch her...

424
01:02:32,017 --> 01:02:34,383
you know, real close.

425
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,245
Meanwhile, in the next room,
he has the other twin...

426
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:40,588
strapped down to some kind of,
you know, operating table...

427
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:44,352
and he'd start doing things to her.

428
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,867
He'd start out kind of small.
Maybe cut off her finger or an ear and...

429
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,197
Karen. Karen.

430
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:55,002
Now, they're strapped down...

431
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:59,877
and the room is soundproof...

432
01:03:00,012 --> 01:03:01,912
and she's screaming.

433
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:08,376
Can you imagine that? Imagine it, okay?

434
01:03:08,454 --> 01:03:09,853
Imagine this.

435
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:13,451
The other one in the other room,
you know...

436
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:15,918
doesn't know anything.

437
01:03:15,995 --> 01:03:18,293
Meanwhile, the doctor's torturing away now.

438
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:24,068
Karen, this is my very favorite part...

439
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,604
so listen. My very favorite part.

440
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:29,004
Now, he stops torturing, this doctor does...

441
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:32,134
and he goes across the hall
to that very next room...

442
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:36,944
and he asks her, he goes,
"Hey, little girl, how you feeling?

443
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,210
"How you feeling?"

444
01:03:40,753 --> 01:03:44,951
See, he wanted to show some kind of link.

445
01:03:46,892 --> 01:03:48,723
Karen, what are you doing?

446
01:03:49,094 --> 01:03:52,552
Get up! I'm trying to teach you something
about history.

447
01:03:53,165 --> 01:03:55,998
Yeah. Go. Let's go.

448
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,795
She's not linked, you see. He brings the...

449
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:05,074
He brings the one twin some food
to see if she can eat...

450
01:04:05,377 --> 01:04:06,844
and he asks her if it tastes good...

451
01:04:06,912 --> 01:04:09,710
and she says, "Hey, tastes great.
Where's my comic book?"

452
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:12,176
Wild stuff.

453
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:25,254
Oh, he cut the other one's tongue off.
That was the thing about the food.

454
01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:37,500
My girlfriend is staying up at the house
on Mission Road.

455
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,907
On Mission Road, yes.

456
01:04:40,913 --> 01:04:44,041
Yes, that's the one. Yeah, I can't reach her.

457
01:04:44,149 --> 01:04:47,175
I don't know what's going on
with the phones up there.

458
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,486
Yeah, no, I haven't heard from her since
I dropped her off a couple of days ago.

459
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:57,126
That's correct. Can someone please go
and check on her for me?

460
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,288
Morning. You sleep well?

461
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,222
Karen, is something wrong?

462
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:04,418
What?

463
01:06:06,665 --> 01:06:09,065
Did you hear that? It's Wendy.

464
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:11,528
Here. Put something on, okay?

465
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:13,733
I'll see.

466
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:23,512
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

467
01:06:23,582 --> 01:06:26,210
- I got it. Can you get that one?
- Yeah.

468
01:06:43,669 --> 01:06:46,194
Remember this? We used to love this.

469
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,854
Ma'am. I'm Deputy Anderson.

470
01:07:04,556 --> 01:07:05,545
Hello.

471
01:07:06,058 --> 01:07:08,754
We received a call from your boyfriend.

472
01:07:09,495 --> 01:07:11,622
Says he's been having trouble
getting through.

473
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:14,495
I just stopped by
to see if everything was all right.

474
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:17,364
Yeah. Everything's fine.

475
01:07:20,506 --> 01:07:22,371
You mind if I have a look around?

476
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,866
Oh, no, go ahead.

477
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,043
- All right.
- Thank you.

478
01:08:15,828 --> 01:08:16,920
Well...

479
01:08:19,097 --> 01:08:21,588
everything looks okay to me, ma'am.

480
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,759
Okay, thanks.

481
01:08:24,303 --> 01:08:26,328
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

482
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:33,742
What did he want?

483
01:08:36,715 --> 01:08:39,240
Nothing. He was just checking on me.

484
01:08:39,751 --> 01:08:40,740
Yeah?

485
01:08:41,687 --> 01:08:42,676
Yeah.

486
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:48,255
I'll take much better care of you
than him, okay?

487
01:08:50,128 --> 01:08:51,789
Badge or no badge.

488
01:09:44,349 --> 01:09:46,044
- Do you have the keys?
- Yeah, why?

489
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:47,745
Give them to me.

490
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,344
Come on.

491
01:09:49,655 --> 01:09:51,850
- Look, tell me what's going on.
- Just give them to me!

492
01:09:51,924 --> 01:09:54,051
- Karen, just talk to me.
- Just trust me.

493
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:55,423
- Hey...
- Get in.

494
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:58,093
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, come on.

495
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:05,058
Okay.

496
01:10:06,805 --> 01:10:07,794
Oh, no.

497
01:10:08,573 --> 01:10:09,835
Shit!

498
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:13,010
Did I leave the lights on?

499
01:10:13,912 --> 01:10:15,470
I don't think it was you.

500
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,356
Wendy.

501
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:43,258
Wendy? Wendy!

502
01:11:59,117 --> 01:12:00,880
Get off her, you fuck!

503
01:12:01,887 --> 01:12:03,582
No, you can't dance worth a shit.

504
01:12:03,655 --> 01:12:04,952
Wendy!

505
01:12:06,058 --> 01:12:08,322
Can you? It's a yes-or-no question.

506
01:12:08,393 --> 01:12:10,088
- Wendy!
- Can you dance?

507
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:12,289
I thought so, honey.

508
01:12:12,364 --> 01:12:14,992
Well, maybe there's something
you do better.

509
01:12:16,034 --> 01:12:20,061
Let's find out. Let's find out
what you do better than dance.

510
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:21,194
You know?

511
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:38,646
Shut up! Don't cry.

512
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:40,346
Don't cry.

513
01:12:41,226 --> 01:12:43,524
It upsets me. It makes me feel bad.

514
01:12:44,129 --> 01:12:47,656
Now, maybe, just maybe...

515
01:12:47,866 --> 01:12:50,767
there's something
you do better than dance...

516
01:12:50,836 --> 01:12:52,895
'cause you can't dance worth a shit.

517
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:54,060
Is there?

518
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:02,340
Why did you tempt me like this,
Wendy, huh? Why?

519
01:13:02,948 --> 01:13:05,246
Why did you tempt me like this?

520
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:08,049
Wendy, why?

521
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:12,249
Why did you do this to me?

522
01:13:12,891 --> 01:13:16,622
Why, Wendy, why? When I like you, honey.

523
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:19,329
I like you, Wendy!

524
01:13:20,532 --> 01:13:22,625
Why? Wendy?

525
01:13:22,868 --> 01:13:26,031
Wendy, don't cry. Don't cry, Wendy.

526
01:13:26,571 --> 01:13:30,268
Don't... Please? Don't cry, Wendy. Wendy.

527
01:13:30,742 --> 01:13:34,872
Wendy, I'll stab you if you continue to cry.
So don't.

528
01:13:35,447 --> 01:13:37,176
Now, I wanna know...

529
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:42,016
why did you do this to me...

530
01:13:42,821 --> 01:13:44,152
when I like you?

531
01:13:44,556 --> 01:13:48,617
I like you! Wendy, I like you!

532
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:51,489
God damn it! I like you, you dumb bitch!

533
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:55,160
Now shut the fuck up.

534
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:58,865
Let's find out
what you do better than dance.

535
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:03,536
I got an idea. I got an idea!

536
01:14:03,975 --> 01:14:05,875
I just got an idea!

537
01:14:07,245 --> 01:14:08,337
I got an idea.

538
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:13,506
Hey.

539
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:23,585
Where are you going?

540
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:28,294
Where are you going?

541
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,560
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

542
01:14:44,382 --> 01:14:48,409
I'll cut your throat. Shut up. Hey, shut up.
Want me to cut your throat?

543
01:14:48,486 --> 01:14:49,510
- Want me to cut your throat?
- No.

544
01:14:56,995 --> 01:14:59,520
- No! No!
- You gonna listen to me? Be quiet.

545
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:01,327
Then be quiet.

546
01:15:03,535 --> 01:15:06,834
Want me to cut your throat?
I can't hear you!

547
01:15:07,138 --> 01:15:09,072
Now, calm down and talk to me.

548
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:12,703
Oh, please, please.

549
01:15:13,144 --> 01:15:15,009
Please, please, no.

550
01:15:17,816 --> 01:15:18,840
Go!

551
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:31,955
Safety off?

552
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:37,066
- Better check.
- Back off! Back off!

553
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:40,503
Back off!

554
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:46,466
Run!

555
01:15:47,045 --> 01:15:48,910
You actually think I kept this thing loaded?

556
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:51,474
Come here!

557
01:16:16,574 --> 01:16:18,064
You stabbed me.

558
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:19,866
No...

559
01:16:20,478 --> 01:16:22,207
that wasn't very nice.

560
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:43,329
Look at me.

561
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:02,019
Can you get up? Can you get up? Wendy?

562
01:17:02,087 --> 01:17:04,453
I need you to run. Okay? Come on.

563
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:07,347
Come on.

564
01:17:23,274 --> 01:17:25,401
No. No. No.

565
01:17:37,889 --> 01:17:41,290
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's okay, baby.

566
01:17:42,394 --> 01:17:45,522
- I didn't know.
- I know. It's not your fault.

567
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:06,847
Let's just get out of here together, okay?

568
01:18:07,852 --> 01:18:09,979
Come on. Come on.

569
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:34,703
Wendy.

570
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,647
Wendy. Wendy!

571
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:49,887
Hurt, Karen?

572
01:18:53,798 --> 01:18:55,390
Bye-bye, Wendy.

573
01:18:57,602 --> 01:18:58,830
Hello, Karen.

574
01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:20,984
Wendy.

575
01:19:26,364 --> 01:19:27,353
No.

576
01:20:12,544 --> 01:20:13,533
Jeff?

577
01:20:18,049 --> 01:20:20,017
What? What's wrong?

578
01:20:20,985 --> 01:20:23,180
- She's dead.
- What?

579
01:20:23,454 --> 01:20:25,547
She's dead. She's dead.

580
01:20:25,623 --> 01:20:26,817
Who's dead?

581
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,290
- Wendy. Wendy.
- Wendy?

582
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:36,993
My sister, Wendy.

583
01:20:37,735 --> 01:20:38,895
Honey...

584
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:43,036
Wendy's been dead for 17 years.

585
01:21:14,405 --> 01:21:17,932
He was just here. He was just here.

586
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,207
He was just here. He was...

587
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:50,089
You all right?

588
01:22:54,205 --> 01:22:55,467
I am now.

589
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:01,237
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

590
01:23:05,783 --> 01:23:07,080
You ready?

591
01:23:09,353 --> 01:23:10,445
Yeah.

592
01:23:12,056 --> 01:23:13,318
Let's go.
