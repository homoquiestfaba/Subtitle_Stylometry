And I guess all that charming,
nervous stuff seems to work somehow...

out there too *

said, ''I haven't slept with him yet''?

Yet! What does ''yet''
mean anyway?

doesn't it? Or does it?

to you, that sentence:

''I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet''?

1014

that you're a liar.

You've seen it twice. Once with Laura--
oops-- and once with me and Dick.

We had that conversation about
that guy making shotgun ammo
off-screen in the 1 4th century.

Right. But let's just say
that I hadn't seen it.

1018
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,616
And I said, ''I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet.'' What would you think?

1019

I'd think that you're a cinematic idiot,
and I'd feel sorry for you.

1020

All right. But from that
one sentence, would you think
that I was going to see it?

I'm sorry, Rob.
I'm struggling here.

You're asking me what would I
think if you told me...

1023

you hadn't seen a film
that you have already seen.

1024

If I said to you--

''I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet,'' yes.

1026

Would you get the impression
that I really wanted to see it?

1027

Oh, well, you couldn't have been
desperate to see it,
otherwise you'd have already gone.

Right. I'm not
gonna see that movie.

Yeah, you know what?

I get the impression
that you wanted to see it...

1031

otherwise you'd have said
you didn't want to go.

1032

But in your opinion,
would I definitely go?

1033

How the fuck am I supposed
to know? Probably.

1034
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,138
- Why?
- Because it's a brilliant film.

and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

1293

record store than be an architect?

- And you wouldn't want to be...

1295

or the king of France?

1296

- All right. There you go, then.

I find it interesting that you
keep showing up here, Laura.

1299

Well, this is
the last of it.

- Ray.

Good-bye.

1308
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,691
Top five things
I miss about Laura.

1309
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,387
One: sense of humor. Very dry,
but it can also be warm and forgiving.

1310
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:04,124
And she's got one of the best
all-time laughs in the history
of all-time laughs.

1311
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,598
She laughs
with her entire body.

1312
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,397
Two: She's got character.

1313
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:12,769
Or at least she had character
before the Ian nightmare.

1314
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,774
She's loyal and honest...

1315
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,970
and she doesn't even take it out
on people when she's having a bad day.

1316
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,274
That's character.

1317
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:22,441
Three:

1318
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,384
I miss her smell...

1319
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,391
and the way she tastes.

1320
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,553
It's a mystery of human chemistry,
and I don't understand it.

1321
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:39,896
Some people, as far as your senses
are concerned,just feel like home.

1322
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,440
I really dig
how she walks around.

1323
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,568
It's like she doesn't care how
she looks or what she projects.

1324
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:55,378
And it's not that she doesn't care,
it's just-- She's not affected, I guess.

1325
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,747
And that gives her grace.

1326
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,755
And five: She does this thing in bed
when she can't get to sleep.

1327
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,156
She kind of half-moans
and then rubs her feet together
an equal number of times.

1328
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,751
It just kills me.

1329
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,424
Believe me, I could do
a top-five-things about her
that drive me crazy...

1330
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,559
but it's just your garden-variety women,
you know, schizo stuff...

1331
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:17,968

that got me here.

01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:19,240
*And each girl
in my little red book *

1770
01:50:19,346 --> 01:50:21,814
*Knows you're the one
I'm thinking of *

1771
01:50:21,915 --> 01:50:25,214
* Oh, won't you please
come back *

1772
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:29,118
* Without your precious love
I can't go on *

1773
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:33,386
* Where can love be
I need you so much *

1774
01:50:33,493 --> 01:50:35,723
*All I did was talk
talk about you *

1775
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:38,161
*Hear your name
and I'd start to cry *

1776
01:50:38,264 --> 01:50:42,166
* There's just
no getting over you *

1777
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:45,032
* Oh, no *

1778
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:53,844
* Oh, won't you please
come back *

1779
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:58,077
* Without your precious love
I can't go on *

1780
01:50:58,184 --> 01:51:02,052
*It's haunting me
I need you so much *

1781
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:04,715
*All I did was talk
talk about you *

1782

*Hear your name
and I'd start to cry *

1783
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:11,463
* There's just
no getting over you *

1784
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:14,089
*All I did was talk
talk about you *

1785
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,464
*Hear your name
and I'd start to cry *

1786
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:20,266
* There's just
no getting over you *
