00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,800
Remember me? Bishop Martin...

7
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,300
Who the hell are you?

8
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,800
I've been wondering that myself too...

9
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,600
What on earth I am

10
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,400
TUBE

11
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,200
After all, everything disappears...

12
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
and...

13
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800

The only thing in the world that's mine,

16
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,700
I need to find the owner of those memories,

17
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,900
Find a way into his heart,

18
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,700
... and

19
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,900
Iove him...

21
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,500
Every 30 minutes!

22
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
- It should be more often
- That's enough. Just go

23
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
- Kiss!
- You're late. Hurry and go!

24
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,600
You're talking to your husband!

25
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,500
You're talking to someone older!

26
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,800
Now go to work.

27
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
What's that?

28
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,500
I'm going!

29
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Good morning!

30
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
- Good morning!
- Hey! Be on time

31
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,500
If the new groom says good morning,
it's good.

32
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,900
Did your wife let you sleep?

33
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,900
What do you think?

34
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
If you're jealous, people,
just say so.

35
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,900
2nd mike open, sir

36
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Which train is approaching Jamsil Bridge?

37
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
2890, sir!

38
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,100
- Reduce speed to below 10km/h!
- Yes, sir!

39
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,900
Tell all trains approaching
there to slow down.

40
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,300
It's under construction.

41
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,000
That bridge isn't in good shape
at all, got that?

42
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,700
All sections, start PPM!

43
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,900
C sector is flooded again, sir!!

44
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,100
Flood Control Team, move out!

45
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,900
Your nose needs flood control, too!

46
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,900
I envy you, new husband

47
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,800
Wow, you must have really exerted
yourself, last night. I envy you!

48
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,900
That's all I got today.

49
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,000
Fuck that. You're killing me.

50
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,500
You think I'm a beggar?

51
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,600
Damn it.

52
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,200
I'll get in shit because of you.

53
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,500
It's better to fucking get
everything worked out now.

54
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you want to die?

55
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,100
No.

56
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Then move your hand.

57
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
I said I'll pay the money back.

58
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
Just tell them to hold on it
for a little longer.

59
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,100
Stupid bitch...

60
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,200
I told you two things I hate most.

61
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,500
Money and being called stupid.

62
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
You ever heard of my traditional medicine?

63
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,700
Please eat something!
Okay? Eat!

64
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Oh fuck!

65
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,000
Fuck, fuck, you fuckers!

66
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Whoever, if show his shoulders

67
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I can see his wallet...

68
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,300
his idea...

69
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,900
his life...

70
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,500
And he has very lonely sholders

71
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,000
too much

72
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,600
Trains 6036, 6042,
hold your positions!

73
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
- Track 63 ATS standby!
- Standby!

74
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,600
6036 EMR hold. Emergency stop!

75
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,700
Dammit!, subway!

76
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Lets it go!

77
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh god! Oh god!

78
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,500
Fuck!
Fuck!

79
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Fuck you, asshole!

80
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,900
You're fucking psycho!

81
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Goddamn it, you fuck! Fuck!

82
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,100
Stop fucking saying
Fuck you hurt

83
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Fuck, what... I... Fuck

84
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Hey, he wants you...

85
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,500
If you need an account of apology,
I'll fax you one

86
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,100
What a nuts!

87
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Sir! You've got to do something
about him, this time.

88
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,500
- you still alive?
- Thanks to you, sir.

89
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,300
You may not realize this because
so many trains have stopped for you

90
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,300
but sometimes, you know,

91
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,500
there's a train that nobody can stop...

92
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Please be careful.

93
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Sounds good to me...

94
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,400
Good, my ass.

95
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Hey, deep shit!

96
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Okay, let me go, you fuck!

97
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
<I'll make a bright country!>

98
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,200
If it's what the people want and need

99
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I am ready to run for president.

100
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,900
Did you say "Rhodes Team"?

101
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,700
I've never heard of such a thing.

102
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
It's a fanciful conspiracy theory.

103
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,200
I think the Bishop has it, sir.

104
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Get rid of them both.

105
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Don't you need a light?

106
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
My bag. That was you, wasn't it?

107
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,500
That wasn't a bag
It's a trash bag.

108
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,400
Your heart's probably the same.

109
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,900
Full of dust and cobwebs.

110
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Don't worry, I'll send it home
just the way it is.

111
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm a cop.

112
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,300
- Don't make mistakes like that.
- It wasn't a mistake.

113
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,400
If you ever need a light, tell me.

114
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,500
<Head of Police Department 1 >
Police regulations! Look them up!!

115
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,400
Police regulations! Look them up!!

116
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Where does it say jump on the tracks

117
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,700
to catch a freakin' suspect?

118
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,700
Where does it say make the suspect
piss in his pants, you lunatic...

119
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,900
Let's talk about yesterday.

120
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,000
I understand you chasing T
outside of your jurisdiction.

121
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,900
I understand that, I do.

122
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,200
But if you didn't get him,
you should haul your ass back here.

123
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Not go break someone's nose.

124
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Do you know who those people are?

125
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,900
They're the special team from
Police Headquarters.

126
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
They've gone ballistic
because you made them lose T.

127
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,500
Now, Headquarter has a war

128
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,000
If you got kicked out of there
you should be laying low.

129
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,600
Stop interfering in my work, boy.

130
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Next time we meet,

131
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,900
one of us dies.

132
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,400
- That's a deal!
- Remember

133
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
today's promise!!

134
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,500
You're still obsessing about
that nasty bastard?

135
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,300
You have your obsession, too.

136
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,300
Well, drinking was the only thing
I can do better than you.

137
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
There are things you should forget.

138
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,300
You're hopeless.

139
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Bravo!!

140
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
Nobody gets close to me.

141
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,600
Such a fool...

142
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,700
Life's not that complicated.

143
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,100
APB on T!

144
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
This comes from the top.

145
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,400
All available men here
are to work on this.

146
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,600
Catch him and you get promoted.

147
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,700
No,no. A double promotion

148
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
By the way

149
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,600
the Mayor's photo up on the subway...

150
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,700
HQ will take care of security

151
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,400
So we just need one man
to follow them for 30 minutes.

152
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,300
Who wants to go?

153
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
That's Detective Jay's job...

154
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Anyone but him.

155
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
If the people from HQ see him,
they'll chew his ass off.

156
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,600
All right, all right. Forget it.

157
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,300
Go to your positions.

158
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,800
Are you working with mouths?

159
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Move your asses! Now!

160
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Hey Detective Jay!

161
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
I can't stand the sight of you.

162
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,400
You'd better really watch it today.

163
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Another screw-up, and that's it.

164
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,400
Aren't you sick of getting crap
from an old fart like me?

165
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,100
Try to be good, okay?

166
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,200
Please have some peace, ok?

167
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,700
You promise, huh?

168
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,100
You know I can't make promises.

169
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,500
Jay! You know it's classified
Orders from the Police Chief

170
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,400
Come on, give me a break

171
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,900
Be rash sometimes
My neck is on the line!

172
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,300
Hey, put more men over there!

173
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,700
People will probably crowd in here.

174
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,900
So keep them under control
Is it clear?

175
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,600
- I have a question, sir!
- What?

176
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,700
What is it?

177
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,500
This is a top security operation.

178
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Don't we get guns, sir?

179
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,000
What guns?

180
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,400
Use the water gun in your crotch
if you need to!

181
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,200
I have a question, sir!

182
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,300
What now?!

183
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,600
Where's our Detective Jay, sir?

184
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,700
What's this?

185
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,000
It goes to Chun Maintenance Yard.

186
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Mr. Park.

187
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,300
We need to cut the power for a while.

188
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,700
I'll shut it all down except for
the front car. Hurry up and fix it!

189
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,900
Okay then, be careful.

190
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Take the subway, not the bus.

191
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,700
It's cooler.[br]It's a love-time.

192
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,100
- you too, right?
- Yeh.

193
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,300
Sangho, I love you.

194
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,100
Me, too, baby.

195
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,000
You can't just say "Me, too."
That's not enough.

196
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,100
Is it so embarrassing to say
that you love me?

197
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,000
That's the best of times.

198
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,300
Give it a year...
He'll probably get tired of it.

199
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,700
Sir!

200
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
Train 7 103's driver is on the line.

201
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,400
D3 7 103 pulling out.

202
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,100
T is up to something.

203
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,400
There must be a target.

204
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Crosscheck with the victims
from the last incident again.

205
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,400
Thanks for your trouble

206
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,400
Forget about T,
and just do your job.

207
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
150,000 policemen in this country.

208
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,700
Even without you,
someone's bound to catch him.

209
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
Can you spare a cigarette?

210
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,100
I don't need a light.

211
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,300
It's an emergency situation
You might as well smoke one

212
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,900
Promises and laws are even more
important in times of emergency.

213
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
Hello.
This is Kay.

214
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,400
Are you done?

215
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,800
Well...

216
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,800
Can you hurry it up?

217
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,700
I've got an appointment.

218
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,300
You're not leaving quietly this time.

219
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,100
I wasn't planning to.

220
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Who are you?

221
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Jay and Kay...

222
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,600
Interesting...

223
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,500
Hello?

224
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Hello, hello?

225
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,800
Get off at the next stop!

226
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,600
What would you like to ask
of the Mayor?

227
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,800
I'd like to see cultural events
in subways and better facilities.

228
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,600
Things will improve from now on.
You can count on that.

229
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,600
Oh no, move it! Shit!

230
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,500
There's nothing to do while I'm moving?
This is too cruel.

231
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,200
Yeah, I'm heartless. So why don't
you run off with that Sammy girl?

232
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,100
- Are you sure? I can really go?
- Yeah, go on. Why not?

233
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,600
Fuck this.
Come on, asshole!

234
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,100
Slow down!!
Or we'll all die!!

235
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,900
All die

236
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,800
Sir!! 7 103's brake systems are all
being switched to manual.

237
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,500
Red alert, all tracks on 37!
Attention all trains on 37!!

238
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,100
No. 7 103, reduce speed!! 7 103!

239
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
You're risking a collision!
7 103, reduce speed!

240
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,500
7 103, can't you hear me?

241
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,900
Reduce speed! You're in danger of colliding with
the train in front. Reduce speed!

242
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Slow down!

243
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,100
Come in, 7 103! Collision alert!
Reduce your speed!

244
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,600
If you don't stop...

245
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,400
I run this train from now on.

246
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,600
If you try to stop the train
by cutting the main power,

247
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,400
you'll see what 1 ton of explosives can do.

248
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,300
Call the police.

249
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,500
T on APB is here.

250
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,500
Slowly...

251
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,200
Dammit, move slowly...

252
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,900
Fuck slowly
shit, fucking slowly

253
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,200
Oh, fuck!

254
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,100
Check all the positions of trains
ahead of 7 103!

255
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,400
ahead of 7 103!
7315,7 427...

256
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,300
- Stay here!
- I'm going...

257
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,700
- I need to get something back from them.
- It's dangerous, stay here!

258
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,800
Then you stay here, too...

259
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,800
I told you it's dangerous.

260
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,200
Yeah, it's dangerous.

261
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,000
That's why I can't let you go alone.

262
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,200
Get the track controller ready.

263
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,700
Kay, are you there listening?

264
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,300
I'll give you exactly 2 minutes
to get here.

265
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,100
After that, a bag will explode
in one of the cars.

266
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
If you want everybody alive

267
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,500
you'd better hurry.

268
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,300
Now, you have 1 minute
50 seconds left.

269
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,300
1 minute 40 seconds.

270
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,200
No!

271
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,100
Kay, don't go!
Kay!!

272
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,000
My name sounds nice
when you say it.

273
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Don't worry. I won't die...

274
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,300
Don't go... Kay.

275
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,400
No!!

276
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,700
30 seconds.

277
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,300
20 seconds.

278
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,000
10 seconds.

279
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
Your time's up. Kay!!

280
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,100
It's you again, Jay.

281
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,100
Your girlfriend screwed up my plans.

282
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,300
Watch me kill her

283
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,600
just like you killed Mun!

284
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,500
No! Let her go!

285
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,900
I'm the one you want.

286
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,600
The subway's not a bad place
for an ending to each other.

287
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Impressive!

288
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,600
Welcome aboard, novice.

289
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,600
Anytime.

290
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,700
Come and stop me.

291
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,700
I run, and

292
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,400
you stop me!

293
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,800
There's no way to stop it from here?

294
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,300
Remote controls were switched off
from inside of Train 7 103

295
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,400
so they'll work only in places
with external braking systems.

296
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,900
Sir! It's a transmission from 7 103.

297
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,100
Who's in charge over there?

298
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,500
I'm the Central Department Chief
Let's talk with me.

299
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,400
No need to talk. Just listen.

300
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,500
In 30 minutes,summon all the press
and live broadcasters...

301
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
And the Ex-Prime Minister, Song ll-Kwon!

302
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,300
Anything getting in my way will not be tolerated.

303
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,800
Do not attempt anything foolish
and keep the deadline.

304
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,100
You have 30 minutes!!

305
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Arrogant prick!

306
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Get the SWAT team ready.

307
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,200
This is the Main Control Center.

308
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,200
This is Detective Jay.

309
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Huh? Jay!

310
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,800
Hey, where Are you now?

311
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,100
The rear control room, sir.

312
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
The T situation is serious.

313
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,100
SWAT team is getting ready to move in.

314
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,400
Anyway,

315
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,700
Get as close to him as you can

316
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,200
and tell us what's going on.

317
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,600
You know? Kind of like a reporter...

318
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,300
He got away last time
because of you, right?

319
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,600
Don't screw things up.
Just wait for orders!

320
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,100
Don't you think things will worse?

321
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,800
Don't say that!

322
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,900
Can we make it alive?

323
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,900
I'd say 70:30.

324
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,700
70% we make it?

325
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,400
No, 70% we die.

326
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,900
Ah, shit, man...

327
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,600
Clear Track 37 first.

328
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,100
Can the trains in front
keep their distance?

329
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,900
For 8 more minutes, yes.

330
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
All right, ATS station to remote!

331
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,600
Determine possible ATS position
for the train 7 103!

332
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,000
Power team, track team,
all standby until then!

333
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,100
Close tracks in all directions!!

334
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,800
Fuck, fuck.

335
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,900
Asshole

336
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Dammit

337
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,000
You motherfucker. Hey, you
son of a bitch, let me go.

338
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,400
Where're you going? Hey Jay!

339
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,300
Detective Choi

340
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:09,800
Detec...

341
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,900
Fucker! You

342
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,400
fucking son-of-a-

343
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,100
Fuck. Fuck, shit.

344
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,700
Fuck

345
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,200
Cramp, cramp!!

346
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,200
<Please anyone read this...>

347
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,000
Right. This sort of tragedy will sell well.

348
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,100
My face will mean death to one old man.

349
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,400
make sure you record every single thing.

350
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,700
Yes, sir!

351
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,900
<Nnybody, read this... >

352
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:00,200
<...will go there. Hatch on floor...>

353
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,700
Don't you dare to be stupid!

354
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,600
You think you'll make it out alive
if you jump out of here?

355
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,200
I'm very sorry, sir...

2
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,100
Time's up.

3
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,300
Are they ready?

4
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,100
Are the old man and the press there?
I asked you if they were there.

5
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,800
They're on their way.
Could you give us more time?

6
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,800
Is that so?

7
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,500
Mr. T! Mr. T!!

8
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,300
What are you doing?
I'm the Mayor!

9
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,400
What do you want?

10
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,600
If you don't want to see any more tragedy,

11
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,700
remember that Song is the only one
who can put a stop to this.

12
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,300
You now have 30 more minutes.

13
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,900
- is The anti-terrorism unit in place?
- Yes, sir!

14
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,500
Tell them to get ready and

15
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,200
alert everyone of the operation
