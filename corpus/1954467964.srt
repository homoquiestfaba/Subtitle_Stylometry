And we want jobs here in America.

You know he's the 38th
richest man in the world?

Yeah, well, if that's rich,
then I don't want to be rich.

No plans. I'm just gonna
enjoy the holiday weekend.

to get out of here.

What?

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,851
This can't be easy to hear,

74
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,438
but they found Mike dead
this morning out front.

75
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,323
What?

76
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,743
How?

77
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,747
Apparently suicide.

78
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,421
He threw himself from
the top of the building.

79
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,217
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

You okay? I'm so sorry, Jane.

81

all of Mike's stuff.

As soon as I heard the
very distressing news,

87
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:30,244
I wanted to be here in
person with you all

91
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:43,891
Because not only was
Mike my employee...

92
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,230
he was also my friend.

93
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,101

continue that counts."

It's interesting, isn't it?

108

This must have been the
last view that he had

109
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,202
before he jumped off the building.

110
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,496
Poor Mike.

111
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,166

112
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,376
Yes, sir.

113
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:02,761
What was his mindset?

114
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,507
That's just the thing.

115
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,677
I never thought Mike would be
capable of something like this.

116

Well, we never know
what we're capable of.

you are the ideal candidate

This is one great opportunity.

With all due respect, sir,

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,666
it's difficult to be excited
about anything right now.

get ahead in this boys' club

was the suicidal type?

you make any accusations.

you been with the company, Lamont?

painless as possible.

283

clear understanding

- of what it is you've observed.
- Of course.

- Regulations, you understand.
- Okay.

286
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,741
How long have you been
with the company?

287
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,910
- Three years.
- Three years?

288
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,789
And was Mike your
supervisor the entire time?

289
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,376
Yes, but he was more
than a supervisor.

290
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,420
He was a mentor.

291
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,714
Kind of like a big brother.

292
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:13,009

difficult this is for you.

now what you found.

to the specifics later.

It's not good.

298
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,107
The transfers were made
to overseas accounts

299
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,150
which were practically untraceable.

300
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,777

should have been under

and control of...

access and authorization.

people on that list.

on a man like that.

00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,256
That's right. That is why I'm here.

321
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,342
But I need to know,
have you discussed this

322
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,510
with anyone else since
making the report?

323
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,305
Phoned anyone?
Received any phone calls?

Yeah, I'm sure.

326
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,860

have had something to do with

01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:52,999
But that doesn't mean they won't
squish you real good if you get unlucky.

723
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:56,169
Believe me, too many people do.
I have seen some things.

724
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:59,005
Anyway, in the future when you
have a problem with an elevator,

725
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:01,340
call a professional.
You might live longer, you know?

726
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,427
That's good advice, thanks.

727
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:06,471
- Hello.
- Help!

728
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:08,181
Hey, you know what?
Don't get her stirred up again.

729
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:11,058
I finally got her calmed down.
She as kind of flipping out.

730
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,186
You know, she got it in her
head I was trying to hurt her.

731
01:05:13,286 --> 01:05:15,855
- Can you believe that?
- I've seen it before. No problem.

732
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:17,607
People, when they get
into closed spaces,

733
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:20,242
sometimes they get a little crazy.
I'll just get her out.

734
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:26,199
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

735
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:28,159
- What are you doing?
- I'm just gonna help you.

736
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:31,704
Uh, yeah, don't.
This is what I do, Frank.

737
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:33,539
When you get a license
to fix elevators,

738
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,333
you can play around in
the shaft all you like.

739
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:37,968
But until then, just,
you know, give me a break.

740
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:43,382
Help! Please, get me out of here!

741
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:45,343
Please, you've got to
get me out of here fast.

742
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,520
- I'm going to go crazy.
- She's totally lost it.

743
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,849
Uh, just take it easy, lady.
It's okay.

744
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,643
We'll have you out in
just a second, all right?

745
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:55,895
No, get me out of here now, please!

746
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:58,064
I'm gonna go crazy in here.
Please, please.

747
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:00,816
Get me out of here. This guy shot me.

748
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,818
Shot you, ma'am?

749
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:06,572
Yes, he shot me.
I have the gun in here.

750
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:10,576
Okay, just relax, ma'am.
Nobody's trying to kill you.

751
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:14,080
I promise I'm gonna have you
out of there in just a second.

752
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,590
If you just...

753
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:20,795
Something wrong?

754
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,630
Robert?

755
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,924
Uh, yeah.

756
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:27,635
Looks like there's...
there's, like, a bunch of...

757
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:30,312
dirt or something caked in here.

758
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,599
Get me out now!

759
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,851
Oh, uh, yeah.

760
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,311
I'll have you out in a second.

761
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:41,282
Actually, I'm gonna have to grab
a screwdriver or something.

762
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:43,492
No.

763
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:46,988
No.

764
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:48,489
No! No!

765
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:51,041
- You're a terrible liar.
- Huh?

766
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:00,426
(JANE SCREAMING)

767
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:07,675
No! No!

768
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,302
No!

Whoa, no! No, no, no!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:07,610
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

776
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,112
Calm down. Calm down. Look.
Look. Look. Look. Look.

777
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,615
Look, I'm just a repair man.
Calm down.

778
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:15,284
Calm down. Stop. Calm down.

779
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:18,037
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Oh, my God.

780
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:19,830
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

781
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,548
Yeah.

782
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:25,211
I'm assuming since
I'm still breathing

783
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:28,172
- that that gun is not loaded.
- No.

784
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:29,882
Is he still out there?

785
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:32,051
Yeah. What the hell is going on?

786
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,720
He's still out there. Did I call you?

787
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,180
No, no, no.

788
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,974
He just did what everybody does when
someone is stuck in an elevator.

789
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:42,019
They call a repairman.

790
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,196
(EXHALES)

791
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,868
Oh, wait. Wait, you are shot.

792
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:51,779
Yeah, but I'm okay.

793
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:53,614
Listen, we need to get out of
here before he comes back.

794
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:56,075
Listen to me.
Where does that ladder go?

795
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:58,202
It goes to the roof, but just relax.

796
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:01,247
I closed the outer doors.
He can't even get into the shaft.

797
01:09:01,347 --> 01:09:02,540
He did before.

798
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,917
Yeah, but before he had this.

799
01:09:05,017 --> 01:09:07,002
It's the building's elevator key.

800
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:09,922
He can't get into the
elevators without it.

801
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:12,591
This is the safest place.

802
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:15,928
In an hour, when my wife starts
to wonder what's happened,

803
01:09:16,028 --> 01:09:17,263
she'll call someone.

804
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:18,931
Can't he just get another key?

805
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,267
There is no other key.
Not in this building anyway.

806
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:24,854
How can you be sure of that?

807
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:26,989
Take a look.

808
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:33,112
What, Robert Brown?
You're Robert Brown?

809
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:36,741
Well, Robert Brown, Jr.
I work for my dad.

(SIGHS)

811
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:40,953
You are?

812
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:44,665
Jane. Jane Porter.

813
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:48,878
Well, it's nothing personal,
Jane Porter,

814
01:09:48,978 --> 01:09:51,722
but it has not been my
pleasure to meet you.

815
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:58,437
(EXHALES)

816
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:06,312
So he's not getting in here?

817
01:10:06,412 --> 01:10:08,481
No.

818
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:10,908
You promise?

819
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:13,619
I promise.

820
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:17,706
Okay.

821
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,877
You pack a mean wallop, by the way.

822
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:25,130
Sorry.

823
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:29,084
(EXHALES)

824
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:31,504
Couldn't he just get a key
from another building?

825
01:10:31,604 --> 01:10:34,715
Uh-uh. Not all buildings
have the same elevator key.

826
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:37,510
What's he gonna do,
break into every one on the block

827
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,553
and risk more witnesses?

828
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,230
I don't think so.

829
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:45,651
Drink up.

830
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:54,819
She'll be here.

831
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:56,946
It's getting pretty late.

832
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:58,705
I better go get her.

833
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:29,562
Oh, hey, Jane. I will
bet you a million bucks

834
01:11:29,662 --> 01:11:31,864
that we are both gonna be fine.

835
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:34,733
A million?

836
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,777
(SCOFFS)

837
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:39,196
Elevator repair business
must be booming.

838
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:40,781
It's pretty good.

839
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:43,033
It's honest work and it's steady.

840
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:45,119
My wife and I have a beautiful house.

841
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:47,788
We put a little money aside
for our kid to go to college.

842
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,007
What more does a man want, right?

843
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:55,254
You're right. You really are.

844
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:58,424
Yeah, I see people just
chasing more, you know?

845
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:01,343
More stuff, more money, more power.

846
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:04,096
Never satisfied.

847
01:12:04,196 --> 01:12:07,733
Those people are more stuck
than we are right now.

848
01:12:09,827 --> 01:12:14,273
Thank you, Mr. Robert Brown, Jr.

849
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,491
What for?

850
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,195
For rescuing me, of course.

851
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,656
Well, we're not out of this box yet,

852
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:25,701
but, yeah, we're gonna be fine.

853
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,079
In fact, I will bet that guy is
probably a million miles away by now.

854
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,372
Just doing whatever...

855
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:34,293
FRANK: 3-4-1 -8-2...

856
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:36,253
What? What did he say?

857
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:38,380
FRANK: ...Ramble Hills Drive.

858
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,761
3-4-1 -8-2

859
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:46,805
Ramble Hills Drive.

860
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:49,600
You hear me, repairman?

861
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,277
Robert? Robert, what's wrong?

862
01:12:53,328 --> 01:12:55,564
You say you fix elevators.

863
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:58,233
Well, I'm in a different
line of work.

864
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,069
You hear me, repairman?

865
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:02,488
You hurt my family, I will kill you!

866
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:06,325
Do you understand? I will kill you!

867
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:09,328
You have 60 seconds to open this door

868
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:13,457
or I'm gonna go down
to Ramble Hills Drive

869
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:16,710
and introduce myself to your family.

870
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,838
They'll get to see up
close what it is I do.

871
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:22,224
Oh, God.

872
01:13:24,777 --> 01:13:26,845
Your wife's kind of hot.

873
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:29,481
I may have a look.

874
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,736
60 seconds and counting, Robert.

875
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:41,610
45 seconds, repairman.

876
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:45,080
You care about a stranger
more than your family?

877
01:13:53,138 --> 01:13:54,790
30.

878
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:57,334
I'm sorry, I've got to do it.

879
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,086
I got a kid.

880
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:00,754
- No, wait! Wait!
- (GROANS)

881
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:03,841
- Let me go. Let me go.
- No.

882
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:05,884
This is my thing. He wants me.

883
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:08,387
I'm not leaving the lives of my
family to you or anybody else.

884
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:10,973
Now help me up.

885
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:13,809
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, Okay.

886
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:16,103
- Help me.
- Come on. Come on.

887
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:18,063
Okay.

888
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:20,566
Okay, you got this.

889
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:23,235
15 seconds.

890
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:24,903
You don't know where to go.

891
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,572
I need to borrow your key card.

892
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:28,991
Shoot.

893
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:30,951
I don't...

894
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:33,120
- All right, hold on.
- You're quick on your feet.

895
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,789
- Stay right here.

Yes. Take the elevator

What? Why?

01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:01,596
Ray!

01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:04,975
It's been a long night.
I just want to go home.

No.

Oh, my God! Baby!

Baby, are you okay, huh?

935
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:16,421
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

936
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,757
- What...
- Don't worry, I'm okay.

937
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:20,884
My God, what happened to you?

938
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,886
What...

939
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:24,930
what happened to you, baby?

940
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,431
Oh, my God.

941
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:28,850
I'll tell you everything.
Could we go home, please?

942
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,894
Yes. Yeah.

943
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:32,771
Okay.

01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:34,606

JANE: I love you.

Your vitals all look really good.

947
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:48,495
- That's good.
- Comfortable?

948
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:51,456
All things considered, yeah.

949
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:53,792
When do you thinks the earliest
I'll be able to get out of here?

950
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:55,627
I'm gonna keep you overnight

951
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:59,005
and if you're feeling well,
probably get you to work on Monday.

952
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:01,466
- Babe.
- Hi.

953
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:04,678
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Hey. Thanks. I'm good.

954
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:07,188
I'm okay. I love you.

955
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:09,975

- What happened?

956
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:11,810
What's up, man? How you doing?

957
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,270
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

958
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,980
Thank you.

959
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,815
Jane, oh.

960
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:19,943
There was a woman on the
elevator with me named Jane.

961
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,778
Yeah, she called and checked on you.

962
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:24,372
- She okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

963
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:27,784
I'll be back to check
on you in a little bit.

964
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:30,044
Hi.

965
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,151
Jane.

966
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,022
Hi.

967
01:21:57,122 --> 01:21:59,608
Well, Jane, you look
surprised to see me.

968
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:01,526
Pleasantly so, I hope.

969
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:04,529
No, I knew I'd see you again.

970
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:06,656
I just thought you'd be in handcuffs.

971
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:09,034
Well, Jane, you know
how these things work.

972
01:22:09,134 --> 01:22:12,662
By the way, I've ordered a complete
and thorough investigation

973
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,957
into this whole sorry affair.

974
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:18,043
Don't insult me, Mr. Gault.

975
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:20,045
I know what you've done

976
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:21,880
and I'm not gonna let
you get away with it.

977
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:26,051
Jane, please don't be foolish.

978
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:29,554
Pick your bets very carefully.

979
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:32,516
You know, a wise man once said,

980
01:22:32,616 --> 01:22:36,019
"He who controls the
nation's money supply

981
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:39,523
cares not who makes its laws."

982
01:22:39,623 --> 01:22:41,233
You're going to jail.

983
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,817
And if I don't?

984
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:45,737
Do you think I'm going
to forget about you?

985
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:49,741
I don't think you or I can afford
to forget about one another.

986
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:52,619
Such a shame.

987
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,872
You know, power would
have sat so beautifully

988
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:58,458
on those elegant shoulders of yours.

989
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:03,255
You would have been a strong,
extraordinary leader in business.

990
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:07,642
But as it is, you've got
no sense of humor.

991
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:12,730
Did you ever consider that
maybe you're not funny, sir?

992
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:16,685
