1
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,267
Come on!

2
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,834
Let's go, let's go!

3
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:34,367
Get them, Michael!

4
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,767
Go, Michael.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,934
Ian, get to the ball!
Alec, run!

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,534
If you won't run,

7
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:59,067
get off the field!

8
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,601
Can you believe
he's humiliating a kid?

9
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,334
It's not the world cup.
They're just kids!

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,868
Shh!

11
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,901
Kid probably
didn't want to play.

12
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,400
Honey, look.
It's Michael.

13
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:18,734
Yeah!

14
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:21,234
Yes! Yes!

15
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,367
Get him, Michael!

16
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,133
Get him
but be careful!

17
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:38,701
Go, Michael! Go! Go!

18
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:40,467
Go, Michael.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,767
Son, let the other boys
get hurt, too.

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,701
Get it!

21
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:53,234
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
He's open!

22
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,634
I sense
an injury developing.

23
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,067
Go and get it!

24
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,701
Hurry up!

25
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:01,767
Hurry!

26
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,767
Come on! Get it!

27
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,868
Michael,
you can get him!

28
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,801
Uh!

29
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,067
Hurry up!

30
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:12,234
Come on!
Oh! Oh, foul!

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,834
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

32
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,701
Are you o.K.,
baby?

33
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,767
How many fingers
is this?

34
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,067
Three.

35
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,834
Are you o.K.?

36
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,534
He hit me in the ribs.

37
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,067
Get back
in there

38
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,467
and get even,
all right?

39
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:34,567
What do you think
I should do, dad?

40
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:38,868
I think you should stay here
and catch your breath.

41
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,100
It's just a stupid game.

42
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,300
I was trying
to protect him.

43
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:55,667
Oh, come on.

44
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,467
He's shooting
baskets now?

45
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,067
Yeah, he's upset.

46
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,834
He shoots baskets
when he's upset.

47
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,067
See, this is
what I hate
about sports.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,067
A few kids
feel great.

49
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,834
Everybody else feels
like garbage.

50
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,701
It's not just sports.

51
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,501
You need to spend
more time with him.

52
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,467
I just took him
to the movies
yesterday.

53
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:25,067
I mean guy stuff.

54
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,501
Oh, boy.

55
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,868
This isn't about
going camping again,
is it?

56
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:32,634
I see him
on the playground.

57
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:35,100
He lacks confidence
around the boys.

58
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,667
Donna, he's
just like me.

59
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,267
He's artistic.

60
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,300
Not everybody's
cut out

61
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,400
for that
Steven seagal stuff.

62
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,601
There is a place
in the world

63
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,200
for sensitive men,
you know--

64
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,801
Michelangelo,
Da Vinci, Mozart,
bill moyers.

65
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,634
We've all made
our contribution

66
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,701
without killing
an animal.

67
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:56,868
I just think he needs

68
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:59,067
more male-oriented
activities

69
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,834
to boost his self-esteem.

70
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:03,801
Otherwise,
he could end up like...

71
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,868
Like me?

72
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:06,534
I didn't say that.

73
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,434
You were
thinking it.

74
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,434
I was trying not to.

75
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,400
So, what are you saying?

76
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,501
I'm failing him
as a father?

77
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,434
Oh,
of course not.

78
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,701
You're
a wonderful
father

79
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,300
in most ways.

80
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,634
You took him
miniature
golfing

81
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,200
15 times
last year.

82
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,701
In a couple sundays,

83
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,567
I'll take him
in the mountains,

84
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,734
and we'll go hiking.

85
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,634
That would be
a start. Good.

86
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,667
I got plenty
of male animal in me.

87
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,868
Oh, you do?

88
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,868
I've demonstrated that
to you.

89
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,834
Ha ha ha!

90
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,534
Mmm.

91
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,434
Talk to him
during dinner.

92
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,434
Tell him something
to make him feel better.

93
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:58,868
You can count on me.

94
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,734
You know who
the biggest sports fans are?

95
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,367
Orthopedic surgeons.

96
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,701
They make a fortune
sewing these guys up.

97
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,868
One shot in the knees,
and the guy's finished--

98
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,734
2 minutes of glory,
40 years of agony.

99
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:12,868
Thanks.

100
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:14,300
Want some more?

101
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,467
No.

102
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:17,834
Why don't you
show him that
letter, hmm?

103
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:20,567
What letter?

104
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:23,334
You and Michael
have been
invited

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,834
to go on
a camping trip.

106
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,334
Camping trip?

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,534
Mm-hmm.

108
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,334
Who would invite me
on a camping trip?

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,300
My school.

110
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,701
Your entire school
is going camping?

111
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,334
No. Just his class.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
The boys
and their fathers

113
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,267
have been
invited to go
to Catalina island

114
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:49,400
for the weekend
to camp buffalo
valley.

115
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,267
No kidding.

116
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,701
Mmm. It's called
a dad and lad
weekend.

117
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,234
Isn't that cute?

118
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,868
Oh, that's adorable.

119
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,868
They'll sleep
in tents.

120
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,300
Wow--tents.

121
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,701
I guess you
want to go on this.

122
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,834
Of course
he wants to go.

123
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,234
He doesn't want to be
the only boy who doesn't go.

124
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,868
I was asking Michael.

125
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,901
All the other kids
are going.

126
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,801
With their fathers.

127
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:29,701
It would look
really bad

128
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,868
if Michael
didn't show up.

129
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,167
Right.

130
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,734
It would be terrible

131
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,601
if you were the only kid
that didn't go.

132
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,400
The other fathers are going?

133
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,767
All of them.

134
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,901
Well, then we'll go, too.

135
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,767
This isn't a psych?

136
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:55,901
No. No, not at all.
It'll be fun.

137
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:58,667
I've never slept
in a tent before.

138
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,067
Yeah, and you know,

139
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,167
I hear Catalina island
is beautiful.

140
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:03,834
Movie stars go there.

141
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,868
Hey, we'll do it--
rock-'n'-roll.

142
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,434
This is going to be
so cool, dad.

143
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,868
I'm going to go call
all my friends.

144
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,267
I'm going to die over there.
You know that.

145
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,167
Do me a favor.

146
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,767
Could you pack
my aspirin,

147
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,067
insect repellent,
and allergy medicine

148
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:27,901
and a cyanide pill

149
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,968
in case things
get bad?

150
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,100
It's two nights
on Catalina island.

151
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,868
Two nights
where I won't get

152
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,067
a wink of sleep.

153
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,367
I get claustrophobic
inside a sleeping bag.

154
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:38,501
Inside
a sleeping bag.

155
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,701
That's why
I wouldn't go
to Woodstock.

156
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,467
No sleep--
that won't kill you.

157
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:46,968
I really feel like
a wuss.

158
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,701
You might enjoy this.

159
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,133
I spent
one day in camp

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,067
my entire
childhood.

161
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:56,067
I know. And a bully
ate your lunch

162
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,200
and stole
your pocketknife.

163
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,267
Your mother
said you didn't
have to go back.

164
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,434
Your father was
too busy drinking
to care,

165
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:06,067
and that's why you're
the bundle of neuroses

166
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,934
that you are today.

167
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,167
Help me.
I am not whining.

168
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,734
Actually,
I'm grateful

169
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,868
for my neuroses,
you know.

170
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,868
I'm a writer.

171
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,868
I depend
on traumatic
childhood memories

172
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,968
in order to be
creative.

173
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,300
Times like this,
though,

174
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,634
I wish
I was more like
your brother--

175
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,167
brain-dead
and devoid
of emotion.

176
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:29,934
[Michael]
I'm ready!

177
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,334
All right. Me, too--
raring to go.

178
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:37,501
I'd rather get
a prostate exam

179
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,067
than go
on this trip.

180
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,167
I hate that
about myself.

181
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,367
I'm working
on liking myself
better.

182
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,501
I'm working
on everything.

183
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,067
Well, your father
survived the korean war.

184
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,767
I'm sure
you'll survive this.

185
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,267
My father won
the korean war
single-handedly.

186
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:54,200
I wish
he were alive

187
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,234
to take Michael
to camp.

188
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,767
He'd jump
out of the plane
to get there.

189
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,734
Go!

190
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,200
All right, Donna,

191
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,200
if they
medevac me back,

192
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,067
take me to ucla,
not some clinic

193
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,067
with people who have
tuberculosis.

194
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,701
You got it,
stud.

195
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,701
Catalina island,
here we come.

196
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,067
Man, here we go.

197
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,501
You have
fun, o.K.?

198
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,067
Buckle up.

199
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,834
Bye, honey.

200
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:31,567
Why did they
have to pick
a Friday night

201
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:32,701
for this trip?

202
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,701
The whole city
left town

203
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,701
on a Friday
night.

204
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,067
Oh, man.

205
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,367
What are you
looking at?

206
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,400
What's this for?

207
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,200
Uh, never mind.

208
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,601
If somebody beats me up,
can we go home?

209
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,667
I was going
to ask you
the same question.

210
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:04,100
Michael,
nobody's going
to beat you up.

211
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:07,234
I remember a time
a bully beat me up.

212
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,767
My dad
started giving me
boxing lessons.

213
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:14,000
That's why I had
these bonded.

214
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,667
We're never
going to move.

215
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:24,100
Oh, great.
Would you look
at this guy's truck?

216
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,801
What's the point
of having that
in Los Angeles?

217
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,334
That's chip Johansen
and his dad.

218
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,334
They're going
on the trip.

219
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,434
Why does he need
a four-wheel drive?

220
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,767
To survive the savage
wilderness of Burbank?

221
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,234
Dad, you're
not going to put

222
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,367
everybody down
over there, right?

223
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,501
No, of course not.

224
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:48,567
You know how when we
go out for a pizza,

225
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:52,267
and you get mad because we have
to wait a long time,

226
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:57,567
and you complain
to the manager?

227
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:59,033
You're not going
to do that at camp, right?

228
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,667
This is
just a weekend.

229
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:03,067
I'm totally
chilled out.

230
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,534
Nothing will
bother me, o.K.?

231
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,934
The guy's got
14 extra headlights.

232
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,934
Where's he going?
To Jupiter?

233
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:22,868
[Honk honk]

234
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,067
Hey, you guys,
watch where you're going!

235
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,601
Oh, man.
Look at this place.

236
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:36,734
Hey, ed, are you
sailing tomorrow night?

237
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:40,100
Can you believe this?
I give up.

238
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,734
Oh, god.

239
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:46,734
I don't know.
Your mother said--

240
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,767
Michael! Michael!
I could use a hand here.

241
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:54,567
Don't worry about me.
I live for your pleasure.

242
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,067
O.k.

243
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,133
Excuse me.

244
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,934
Hey, over there!
Give me it!

245
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,100
Excuse me.

246
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,567
Oh, man! Ugh!

247
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,567
Oh, gosh! Ugh!

248
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,267
Have a little accident?

249
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,567
I think I'm fine.

250
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:30,434
Let me help you out--

251
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,100
always prepared.

252
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,067
Oh.

253
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh.

254
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,801
Uh...

255
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:50,734
Have we ever met
before?

256
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,734
Third-grade parents' day.

257
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,100
Oh, that's right.

258
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,601
You're, like,
an FBI agent.

259
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,334
Deputy sheriff.

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,367
I think you
got that. Thank you.

261
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:04,934
You're a musician
or something?

262
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:05,968
I'm a writer.

263
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,834
Yeah, I knew it was
some hippie job.

264
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:10,767
Uh, so, uh,

265
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,067
you guys going
camping, too?

266
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,434
Mother/daughter camp-out.

267
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,467
These broads
drive me nuts.

268
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,467
They can't go anywhere
without their hair-dryers.

269
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:20,434
You know the type.

270
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,367
Yeah.

271
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,200
Jo and me--we brought
our rock-climbing gear,

272
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,067
survival tents,
hiking boots.

273
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:30,367
We'll do some exploring,
right, Jo?

274
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,767
Catch you later, bud.

275
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,868
Take care.

276
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,601
Hey, dad, the boat--
it's so cool.

277
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,701
The trip
takes three hours.

278
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:40,667
You're kidding.

279
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:42,133
Want pizza?

280
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
No.
I just had some.

281
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,434
[Horn blows]

282
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:48,901
<i>Attention, please.</i>
<i>The</i> Catalina express...

283
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,067
That's us.

284
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,100
What did he say?

285
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,234
Just tell them you're
in the fourth grade.

286
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,801
Michael, I could use
some help here.

287
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,067
Thank you. Thanks.
Thank you, son.

288
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,934
<i>Proceed to the loading dock.</i>

289
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,334
Yeah, I got it.

290
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,400
All right, campers.

291
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,100
Just stack your gear

292
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,334
neatly in the pile
inside the boat.

293
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
Now, I hope everyone

294
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,868
remembered
to write their names

295
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,267
on their sleeping bags.

296
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,901
We're all friends here,

297
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:20,634
but no sense setting the table
for temptation.

298
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,133
Know what I mean?

299
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,100
Michael, you
could carry
something.

300
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,234
I don't want to go.

301
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,133
You were looking
forward to this.

302
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,334
I changed my mind.

303
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Look, your mother
says we have to go,

304
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,200
so we're going.

305
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,100

306
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:43,901
Oh!

Boy in the water!

308
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,067
Just hang on
a second.

Who is that kid?

312
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,133
I'll pull you in.

313
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,901
This is no way
to start the weekend, son!

314
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,234
This is
a good place.

315
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,400
Let's sit
by the window.

316
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,701
The sun
will set soon--

317
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:12,868
great time
to start

318
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:16,367
a three-hour
boat trip.

319
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:19,567
Hi. Mind if we buddy up
with you guys?

320
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:22,067
Oh, gee,
that'd be perfect.

321
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100

which is crazy--

the economy
being what it is--

335
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,534
but you got to pay
the bills.

they won today.

the ranch-style

or the onion-soup-dip
flavored potato chips?

each and two root beers.

Grab your gear
and assemble on deck.

Come on, Michael.
We're here.

The fun begins now.

What time
is it?

368
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,767
Oh, jeez, it's
almost midnight.

369
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:12,267
It's crazy to keep
10-year-olds up
this late.

370

We'll get to bed soon.

371

Hey, watch
who you're pushing.

This is it?

375

I feel like we're
landing in Vietnam.

376
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,767
You were in 'nam?

377
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:36,968
No. It was all volunteer
by the time I came up.

378
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,267

into flames here,
I'll call you.

our flashlight, dad?

402
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,067
Why?

403
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:36,100
We're trying to stick
to a schedule, sir.

404
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,100
We'd all like
to get to bed soon.

Let's bring that truck
down here now.

Everyone,
get off the road.

409

for this drop-off here.

Bring it down here.

a good time,
Michael?

This is cool,
huh?

Let's all pitch in

415

and toss this gear
into the truck.

on the ground.

Sometimes, it's important
to question authority.

pitches in.

Everybody helps.

422
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:19,400
As soon as we get
the truck loaded,

423
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,400
we can hike to the camp.

424

Hike?

425

For those of you
on your first visit here,

426
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,501
the road gets narrow,

427
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,434
especially where it winds
along the cliffs.

428
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,334
This is insane.

429
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,734
Dad, be quiet!

430
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,434
So make sure you all have
your flashlights.

431

If we keep up a good pace,

432
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,267
we should meet the truck
in the camp

433
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,801
in, oh, 45 minutes.

Dad,
I'm not tired.

438

Can't we take
the truck?

439
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,167
Because my arches--

440
00:20:58,234 --> 00:20:59,567
that's a good point.

441
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,200
For insurance reasons,

442
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:04,067
no one can ride
in the truck.

443
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:07,200

o.K. To hike
in total darkness?

do we have?

I don't feel dirty.
You feel that dirty?

546
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
No.

547
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,167
Let's go.

548
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:51,400
I don't know.
Probably pancakes
or something.

549
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:01,667
It's been
about six hours.

550
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:04,868
They were supposed
to serve breakfast
at 7:30.

551
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,167
It's almost 8:00.

552
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:08,667
You said nothing
would bother you.

553
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:10,167
Anybody get
any sleep?

554
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:11,868
Michael slept
pretty well.

555
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:13,167
You snored.

556
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:14,667
I slept?

557
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,868
The cots are hard.
Our floor is wet.

558
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,334
Don't be a wuss.

559
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,300
Stop that.

560
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,367
He is.

561
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:23,300
Fine.
Don't call him that.

562
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,200
Crickets
in our tent

563
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:26,534
drove me nuts.

564
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,267
Good morning, men!

565
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,868
Good morning.

566
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,934
It's been a half-hour.
When do we eat?

567
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,601
We're working on it.

568
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:37,367
How do you
work on breakfast?

569
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:41,167
Just burn some toast
and throw it at us.

570
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,501
[Laughter]

571
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,334
I'm sure
it'll be

572
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,367
just a few
minutes more.

573
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:47,834
That's my gym teacher.

574
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:51,300
I have him all year.
Don't make him hate me.

575
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,667
I won't make
anybody hate you.
Just relax.

576
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,400
Do you have
French toast?

577
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,200
My son doesn't like
scrambled eggs.

578
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:08,000
I like 'em.

579
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,167
You never
eat them.

580
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:10,667
I like 'em,
dad.

581
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:13,868
If you could
do me a favor--

582
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,167
here's 5 bucks.

583
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:17,667
Fry my kid
a couple eggs.

584
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,901
I can't touch anything
except this spoon.

585
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:25,167
I see. Well,
you're doing
a fabulous job.

586
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,968
I'll submit
your name

587
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,968
to represent
my district
in congress.

588
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,167
Ha ha.

589
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:33,033
Ha ha.

590
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:42,033
The coffee's
pretty good, huh?

591
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:46,267
How was the water-taxi
ride, baby?

592
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:49,434
You said no one
would remember.

593
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:51,501
No more boat rides.

594
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,501
We won't even take
the ferry back tomorrow.

595
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,501
We'll swim
like dolphins.

596
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,033
They ran out of food.

597
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,868
They ran out of food?

598
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,501
We got prunes
and tang.

599
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,901
Don't combine
those two.

600
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:05,534
It could cause
a nuclear reaction
inside your stomach.

601
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,734
They got this food
where they got those tents.

602
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,801
They say make sure
you're prepared--

603
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,801
to order a pizza.

604
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,400
If you don't like it,
get out of here.

605
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,501
I don't
think anybody
wants to leave.

606
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,767
I do.

607
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,200
We're just
joking around.

608
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,467
Try that
at the firehouse.

609
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:37,167
The food's pretty bad.

610
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,901
Look, my kid
really looks forward

611
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,701
to coming here every year.

612
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:48,701
Now, I don't want it
ruined by girls

613
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,200
who can't stand
a little inconvenience.

614
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:53,200
Humor might
make the situation

615
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,968
more fun
for everybody.

616
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:56,701
It's a school camp-out.

617
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,467
We're not retaking
Kuwait.

618
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:00,234
You're knocking the war?

619
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,534
No. No, not at all.

620
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:07,767
Thank goodness
we got that emir
back on the throne.

621
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,167
I'm going to watch you.

622
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,367
Thanks.

623
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:21,434
If I do
anything funny,
take my picture.

624
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,734
That guy
will kill
your dad.

625
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:42,067
[Honks]

626
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,467
Good morning.

627
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:45,934
I'd like to make
a couple of announcements.

628
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:49,968
♪ Announcements, announcements,
announcements ♪

629
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,634
♪ what a heck of a way
to start the day ♪

630
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,300
♪ announcements ♪

631
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:56,501
♪ announcements,
announce-- ♪

632
00:32:56,567 --> 00:33:00,567
Oh, boy. You campers
really got me that time.

633
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:04,567
I won't make that mistake again.

634
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:09,534
I do have
just a few brief...Notices.

635
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,334
Please don't throw stones
into the cove.

636
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,334
It took mother nature
millions of years

637
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,901
to wash all those stones
up on the beach.

638
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:22,834
If each of us throws
six stones into the water,

639
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,467
there'll be no stones
left there.

640
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:28,934
And the world would
come completely
to an end.

641
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:33,467
You'll get us
in trouble!

642
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:34,501
Sorry.

643
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:37,567
Also, campers,
the west drainage basin

644
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,133
is now officially open

645
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,901
for volleyball
and, uh, other kinds of ball.

646
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,467
That would be
the swamp.

647
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:46,901
Dad!

648
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,601
Sorry.

649
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,934
Our first activity
this morning
is archery.

650
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:54,801
We'll see you at the range
in 10 minutes.

651
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,601
Did anyone find
those bows and arrows?

652
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:02,934
Right. Well,
we'll stay on top of that.

653
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:04,300
And finally,

654
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,400
remember
that we are guests

655
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:08,100
here at this camp,

656
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:12,200
and...and what,
campers?

657
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,801
Good campers
are good guests.

658
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:18,067
Leave this camp
the way you found it.

659
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:19,734
A toilet.

660
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:22,067
Dad!

661
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,601
Sorry again.

662
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:41,434
Nice shot!

663
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,734
Right in the middle!

664
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,067
All right!

665
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,567
Yeah.

666
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:50,234
They have fancy bows.

667
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,234
We got
this kid stuff.

668
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,734
They brought
their own.

669
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,234
Nobody said
we could do that.

670
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,534
We would have brought
our own.

671
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,434
We don't have
our own bows.

672
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:04,167
But we could have
rented some.

673
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,400
Have you done
this before?

674
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,234
Sure. A couple times.

675
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,968
What do I do?

676
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,534
Watch me
carefully, o.K.?

677
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:13,467
You simply
take the arrow

678
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:16,100
and rest
the back of it

679
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,100
on this little
doohickey thing

680
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,934
here on the bow.

681
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,501
Then you shoot,
right?

682
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:25,734
No. Uh, Michael, you know what
the secret to archery is?

683
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:27,234
It's mental preparation, o.K.?

684
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,167
You have to really
just close your eyes

685
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,100
and imagine the arrow
flying through the air

686
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,434
and hitting the target.

687
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:36,567
You look stupid.

688
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,868
I may look stupid,
but I'm not really stupid.

689
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:42,634
This is ancient
zen Buddhist philosophy.

690
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,567
This will work. Just watch.

691
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:47,634
I just draw back
on the arrow here,

692
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,868
and my mind is at peace--

693
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:52,601
it's better
if you're not talking--

694
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:57,434
and then--
and then I just let go.

695
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:01,334
The ancient zen masters

696
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,067
didn't care
if they hit the target

697
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:07,067
if their mind
was at peace.

698
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,534
Your turn? Sure.

699
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:10,934
O.k., carefully
take an arrow.

700
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:13,067
Put this up. O.K.

701
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,901
Now, just clear your mind

702
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:18,167
and let your thoughts
guide the arrow.

703
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:25,501
All right!
Practically a bull's-eye.

704
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:35,067
It's not him.
It's his equipment.

705
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:48,834
They said we weren't
supposed to use the canoes

706
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:51,100
unless somebody
was watching us.

707
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,501
I'm watching us.

708
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,834
Here,
grab an oar.

709
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,234
It's a paddle, dad.

710
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,067
Of course.
Turn around.

711
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,934
I could have
been

712
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,234
a championship
canoer

713
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,734
if I had done it
more than once.

714
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:04,801
All right.

715
00:37:04,868 --> 00:37:07,367
O.k.,
here we go.

716
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,601
[Groaning]

717
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,667
Um, dad, we're going
to hit the rocks.

718
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:21,067
This isn't
working.

719
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,467
I'm paddling hard.

720
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:24,767
You're
doing great.

721
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:27,400
You know
what the secret
to canoeing is?

722
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,067
It's teamwork.

723
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,067
We paddle on
opposite sides.

724
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,801
That gets us
going straight.

725
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:36,100
You got it.
There's a rock under us.

726
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,067
Stay away
from the rocks.

727
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,567
Away from
the rocks.

728
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:41,067
Away from the rocks.

729
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,567
Say it with me.

730
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:45,100
Think zen--
think away
from rocks.

731
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:46,567
Away from the rocks.

732
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,634
Let the rock
hear you.

733
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:50,567
Stay away from the rocks.

734
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:52,100
O.k.,
here we go.

735
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,767
Go! Go!

736
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,067
Row!

737
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:57,767
I'm rowing!

738
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:58,968
Uh-oh!

739
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,234
Don't worry.

740
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,634
I did
this once--
in a dream.

741
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,934
Get away
from that rock.

742
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,234
I'll get us
out of this.

743
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,934
Here we go.
Paddle.

744
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,067
O.k.

745
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:11,567
Paddle, son.

746
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,067
I'm paddling.
Whoa!

747
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:14,767
Don't worry about it.

748
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,067
We're moving now.

749
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,567
Here we go.

750
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,567
I'll do
the other side.

751
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:22,067
O.k. We know
how to do this.

752
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,567
Excellent,
excellent.

753
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,567
Try
the other side.

754
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:29,868
Want to race?

755
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,367
You're on!

756
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,067
First one
to the buoy wins.

757
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,167
Let's not race, dad.

758
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,701
We have to, son.

759
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:40,100
We don't want
them to think
we're wusses.

760
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,767
O.k., let's
get going, boy.

761
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:50,067
O.k.

762
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,501
O.k.
Oh, very good.

763
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,200
Come on!

764
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:59,734
On your Mark,
get set, go!

765
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:02,234
Michael, give it
all you got!

766
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,067
I'm trying!

767
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,767
You're
slowing us down.

768
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:06,868
Sorry!

769
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:10,067
You're getting it
all in my glasses!

770
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,567
Put the paddle in.

771
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,234
You're
holding us back.

772
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,567
I'm sorry!

773
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:16,067
You're
getting
me wet!

774
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,234
Michael!

775
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,400
Oh, man,
she's way ahead.

776
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:21,100
You're getting me
soaked!

777
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,734
Come on! We're not
going fishing!

778
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,734
You're rocking
the boat, dad.

779
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:27,934
I'm not rocking
the boat.

780
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:29,734
We can't
let them win.

781
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,934
Michael, you're
getting it all
over my glasses!

782
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:34,067
Sorry!

783
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:35,400
You've got to steer.

784
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,400
You wanted
to do this!

785
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,100
Think zen. Think--

786
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,601
I'm coming up front
to steer.

787
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:42,968
Uh, dad!

788
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,801
You're rocking
the boat!

789
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:46,767
Whoa!

790
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,634
Oh! Oh!

791
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:50,100
Michael?

792
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,267
Dad!

793
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,067
Oh, now we're
in trouble.

794
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:55,934
Oh, no!

795
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:57,868
Bail.

796
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:03,067
I think we want
to go towards
shore, son.

797
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,901
It's that way.

798
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,234
Don't worry about it.

799
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,934
You should
have worn

800
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,200
your life
jacket.

801
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,467
I'm floating.
I got some buoyancy.

802
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:18,567
I still think
$400 is a little steep

803
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,367
for a 30-year-old canoe.

804
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:22,934
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>the father/son penatha--</i>

805
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,501
<i>the father/son pethanta--</i>
<i>what's this word?</i>

806
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,834
Pentathlon. Pentathlon.

807
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,868
You just want
to concentrate.

808
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:37,667
That's all it is.

809
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:39,534
So this is where
my breakfast went.

810
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:42,901
This will redeem us
for the canoe.

811
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:46,067
And the archery
and the water taxi.

812
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:49,567
Look, it's one race.
I'll do the best I can.

813
00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:52,434
Thank you.
These things poached?

814
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:54,934
The four relays

815
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,901
are the first parts
of the pentath--yeah--

816
00:40:57,968 --> 00:40:59,400
to be followed

817
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,734
by the basketball
competition
this afternoon.

818
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:04,334
Each dad and lad
will receive points

819
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,601
based on their times
in the relays.

820
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,267
We're going
to lose.

821
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,567
No, we're not.

822
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,567
I have
my master's degree.

823
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:14,067
In journalism.

824
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,467
We're going
to lose.

825
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:17,968
I won't be
the laughingstock
of this camp.

826
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,667
On your Mark...

827
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:25,634
Get set...Go!

828
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:27,968
Go! Run, dad!

829
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,367
I'm one with the egg.
I'm watching the egg.

830
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,200
Come on, dad!

831
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:36,334
Don't drop it!

832
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,667
Oh! Ooh, I feel like
humpty dumpty.

833
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,567
Come on, dad!
Let's go!

834
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,601
Come on, dad!

835
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,667
Come on, dad!

836
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,634
Go! Go! Go!
Go, chip! Go!

837
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:55,434
Get it by the--
put it on here!

838
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:56,901
Go! Michael, go!

839
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:04,200
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

840
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:05,834
Pick it up!

841
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,901
Come on, Michael!
Pick it up!

842
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,534
Come on! That-away!

843
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:12,467
Come on, dad!

844
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,501
Watch it, kid!

845
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,300
Go! Go!

846
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:18,701
Come on, dad!

847
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:19,701
O.k.

848
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:22,167
Whoa!

849
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:23,434
Go, dad!

850
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,234
I'm fine.

851
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:31,400
O.k., get it.
O.K., my foot's stuck.

852
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,467
Out of his way!

853
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:38,534
Careful! Careful!

854
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:39,701
Go, chip!

855
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:40,834
Go! Go! Go! Go!

856
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:42,567
Keep going!

857
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:44,267
Watch your balance!

858
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:46,667
I'll get ready
with the M&M's.

859
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,200
Uh! Suck, dad! Suck!

860
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:55,400
I'm sucking.
I'm sucking.

861
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:57,067
Suck, dad! Suck!

862
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,667
Suck harder,
dad! Suck!

863
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:04,133
Something's wrong
with my straw.

864
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,667
Go, dad!

865
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:10,067
Go, dad! Go! Go!

866
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,667
Go, Brent!
Go for it!

867
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,701
Go, Brent!

868
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:18,534
O.k., it's
a rhythm thing.

869
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:20,067
You're doing good.

870
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,067
Remember what I told you
about being zen?

871
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,901
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

872
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:27,734
You can't do zen
in the three-legged
race.

873
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:30,200
Hut! Hut! Hut!

874
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:34,601
Hop!

875
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:37,667
I got you.

876
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:39,067
Yeah!

877
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,634
Yeah!

878
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:47,234
Are you o.K.?

879
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,567
Did we win?

880
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:50,934
Yay! Yay!

881
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,667
Woo! Woo!

882
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:56,567
You all right?

883
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,234
Yeah.

884
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,400
Watch your step there.

885
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,434
I see a lizard.

886
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:21,200
When we get home,
I'm getting back into shape.

887
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:22,534
I'll tell your mother

888
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:23,767
to stop hanging
the dry cleaning

889
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:25,801
on the exercise bike.

890
00:44:25,868 --> 00:44:26,834
We got a chance

891
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:28,234
at winning
this pentathlon
today.

892
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,534
The neanderthals

893
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:31,734
are only
a few points
ahead.

894
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,300
With basketball
this afternoon,

895
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:36,067
I can close
the gap.

896
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:38,367
You said winning
didn't matter,

897
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,300
that it's
just a stupid game.

898
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:41,901
I don't want you
to become

899
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:43,968
some overly
competitive
jerk.

900
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:45,567
What are you?

901
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:48,267
I'm enjoying
the weekend.

902
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,901
I'm having
a good time.

903
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:53,701
If we drive
that guy Chet

904
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:54,901
and his son, chip,
into the dirt,

905
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:55,934
so much the better.

906
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:57,701
I can't talk to you.

907
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:00,467
Now you sound like
your mother.

908
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,234
All right, men,

909
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,100
as quickly as you can,
let's gather down here.

910
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:07,300
Gather in here.

911
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:10,801
Now, dads and lads,
before this next activity,

912
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:12,367
I just have
one announcement.

913
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:15,734
♪ Announcements, announcements,
announcements ♪

914
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:17,634
♪ what a heck of a way
to start the day ♪

915
00:45:17,701 --> 00:45:19,400
♪ announcements ♪

916
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,267
Oh, you're just
too quick for me,

917
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:26,367
but now for one of the most
unusual and exciting features

918
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,400
of our camp buffalo valley--

919
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:31,767
a real, authentic
abandoned silver mine.

920
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,667
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

921
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:36,734
This is
a real silver mine

922
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,100
that was actually worked

923
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,467
first by the Spanish
in the 1700s

924
00:45:40,534 --> 00:45:42,701
and then,
oh, 130 years ago

925
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:44,067
by two Americans

926
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:47,200
who really mined
real silver right here.

927
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:48,467
I'm sure you remember

928
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:50,667
our friend
Mr. George rosebrock.

929
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:52,467
Hello, George!

930
00:45:52,534 --> 00:45:54,901
Gentlemen.

931
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:56,267
Hi, George. Hi, George.

932
00:45:56,334 --> 00:45:59,834
Mr. Rosebrock has agreed
to take us on a tour

933
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:02,968
deep into the bowels
of this mine.

934
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:04,501
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

935
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:07,067
This is so cool--
a real silver mine.

936
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:08,701
Maybe there's bats.

937
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:09,901
And salamanders.

938
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:11,834
So for those of you

939
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,334
who don't suffer
from claustrophobia...

940
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:19,234
Let's check out
those flashlights

941
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,634
and go down in the mine.

942
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:22,834
Isn't this great?

943
00:46:22,901 --> 00:46:25,133
Yeah. How bad can it be?

944
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,567
They're letting kids
go in there.

945
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:30,501
For a mine,
it's probably
very spacious.

946
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:33,734
I'll go anywhere
I don't have to hop.

947
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:51,467
What if we
get trapped
in there?

948
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:54,934
Once on TV this guy
was checking out a mine,

949
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:57,734
and he got stuck
in this crack.

950
00:46:57,801 --> 00:47:01,934
They had to
lower food and water
in a bucket.

951
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:03,968
Then the mine
collapsed,

952
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,968
and he was buried
alive.

953
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:09,100
Michael, please.
Nothing like that
will happen.

954
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:12,067
A friend and I
were exploring
a cave,

955
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,367
and he got
stuck--

956
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:15,701
will you shut up!

957
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:16,801
I'll shut up.

958
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,467
[Scoutmaster]
Fathers, be careful

959
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:20,067
as you enter
the mine

960
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:23,634
because
the ceiling is
very, very low.

961
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:26,667
I guess the airy,
spacious part
is inside.

962
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:31,567
I'm an old spelunker
from way back.

963
00:47:31,634 --> 00:47:33,601
[George]
All right,
gentlemen,

964
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:36,701
if you're ready,
follow me

965
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:40,567
into the very bowels
of the earth.

966
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:41,634
Here we go.

967
00:47:41,701 --> 00:47:43,968
[Spenser]
I'm thinking
airy, spacious--

968
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:46,067
airy and spacious.

969
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,767
I feel air.
It looks spacious.

970
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:49,634
[Spenser]
Duck down,
Michael.

971
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,901
This first shaft

972
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:53,868
was carved
by the Spanish

973
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:55,801
and their
Indian guides

974
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:59,501
some 200 years ago
out of solid rock,

975
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:01,300
and somehow
these old walls

976
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:03,534
are still
holding up.

977
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:05,601
So with any luck,

978
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,834
we may get
out of here
alive.

979
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:09,801
Ha ha ha!

980
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:12,801
Now, once there
was two men

981
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:14,801
that were mining
this claim,

982
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:16,734
and one of them
got to suspecting

983
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:20,300
that the other
was stealing
silver

984
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,067
and hiding it
in an abandoned
shaft

985
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,667
deep in the recesses
of the mines.

986
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:27,767
Ooh!

987
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:30,501
Deep in the mine

988
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:33,234
with no hope
of ever getting out,

989
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,200
they became
the mole people!

990
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:38,067
Ha ha ha!

991
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:41,133
[George]
This will be
a tight squeeze,

992
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,300
so watch
your heads,

993
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,167
and we'll
go through

994
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:45,834
one at a time.

995
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,968
Here we go.

996
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:02,100
Oh, boy.

997
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:03,400
If you weren't
careful,

998
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:05,100
you could
get stuck.

999
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:07,133
Come on, dad.

1000
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,534
Hey, spense,
you o.K.?

1001
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:18,467
Spenser,
spenser...

1002
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:25,100
Hey, dad,
what's the matter?

1003
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,434
Help him up,
somebody.

1004
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:28,133
There's
something wrong.

1005
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,434
What's wrong?
Scared?

1006
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:31,267
Out of the way.

1007
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:32,767
Spenser, spenser,
it's Aaron.

1008
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:34,167
Can you hear me?

1009
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:37,067
Can you hear me?
Spenser.

1010
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,501
[Boy]
He fainted.

1011
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:42,133
<i>[Doctor]</i>
<i>What's</i>
<i>the boy's name?</i>

1012
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,133
<i>[Father]</i>
<i>Spenser.</i>

1013
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:48,801
<i>You have</i>
<i>a nasty break,</i>
<i>spenser.</i>

1014
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,367
<i>I'll have to</i>
<i>set the bone,</i>

1015
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:53,634
<i>so I want you</i>

1016
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:55,634
<i>to put</i>
<i>your arm out</i>

1017
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,534
<i>as straight</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

1018
00:49:57,601 --> 00:50:00,067
<i>This may hurt</i>
<i>a little.</i>

1019
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,300
<i>Be a man,</i>
<i>son.</i>

1020
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>Be a man,</i>
<i>son.</i>

1021
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,000
<i>Be a man,</i>
<i>son.</i>

1022
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:08,000
<i>Be a man,</i>
<i>son.</i>

1023
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:10,901
<i>Be a man,</i>
<i>son.</i>

1024
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:15,534
[Scoutmaster]
Feeling better?

1025
00:50:17,868 --> 00:50:19,968
[Aaron]
Too close,
huh, spense?

1026
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:24,133
Where are
my glasses?

1027
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,334
Thank you.

1028
00:50:28,801 --> 00:50:30,167
Where am I?

1029
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,601
You're
in my tent.

1030
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:32,868
I'm glad
you're better.

1031
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:35,367
We've never had
a father faint
before.

1032
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:37,200
I didn't faint.

1033
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,133
You looked like
you fainted.

1034
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,267
Dad, are you
o.K.?

1035
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:45,267
I'm fine.
I just got
a little dizzy.

1036
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,968
It was probably
something I ate.

1037
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:49,434
It had to be.

1038
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:53,267
Perhaps you should
go to your tent
and rest.

1039
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:55,267
I don't need
to rest.

1040
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:58,334
I'm fine.
Is it 106 in here?

1041
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,767
I'd be o.K.

1042
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:02,267
If I wasn't
in this sauna.

1043
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:04,501
All right,
so, what's next?

1044
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,067
Well, everybody's
at the beach.

1045
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,400
Then we're there,
too.

1046
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,300
These are
fascinating.

1047
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,767
You ever
smell one?

1048
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:14,133
I'll steal some

1049
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,133
and put them under
your mom's nose

1050
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,434
when she snores.

1051
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,267
Let's get
our suits on.

1052
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:23,634
Be careful, Mr. Paley.

1053
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:26,834
First thing you do
is hock one in here--

1054
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:27,968
some spit.

1055
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:31,167
Then move that loogie
around in there.

1056
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:33,868
That will clear off
your lenses.

1057
00:51:33,934 --> 00:51:35,667
Great.

1058
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,100
[Michael]
Can we try
scuba diving?

1059
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:40,667
Scuba diving?

1060
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:42,467
You don't want
to do that.

1061
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,868
That's very,
very dangerous.

1062
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:46,567
You got to
be certified.

1063
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:48,501
You need $10,000
worth of equipment.

1064
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,367
It's very,
very dangerous.

1065
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:52,601
Your mom
doesn't want us
doing that.

1066
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,868
Snorkeling is better,

1067
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:57,834
and your lungs
don't explode.

1068
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:02,100
I bet I can
spot more fish
than you.

1069
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:04,534
Uh, o.K.?

1070
00:52:05,968 --> 00:52:07,234
Yeah!

1071
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,267
Hey, they're
loving it, man.

1072
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,968
I can't see
anything.

1073
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:24,067
It's too muddy.

1074
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:25,834
I know.
This stinks.

1075
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:28,167
I'm going to
mess around
with the guys.

1076
00:52:28,234 --> 00:52:30,868
I'll be working
on my sunburn.

1077
00:52:30,934 --> 00:52:33,167
Be safe.

1078
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,434
Hey, spense.

1079
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,400
Hey.

1080
00:52:58,868 --> 00:53:00,767
So, what's wrong
with scuba diving?

What?

1082
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:04,534
Nothing's wrong
with it.

1083
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:07,367
It's
a little dangerous.

1084
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,467
A lot of things
worth doing
are dangerous.

Like what?

1086
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:14,400
Like scuba diving.

1087
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:17,367
There's more
adventurous ways

1088
00:53:17,434 --> 00:53:18,567
to spend time
with our sons

1089
00:53:18,634 --> 00:53:19,801

You know,

00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:22,701
I'm starting
to realize

1092
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:25,934
what the point
of this whole

1093
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:28,133

we're lousy fathers.

Excuse me, sir.

1098
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,167
I believe
we asked everyone

1099
00:53:42,234 --> 00:53:45,334
not to throw stones
into the cove.

1100
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,901

I forgot.

1103

I will not
do it again.

ask you

1105

to retrieve the stone

1106
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,601
and put it
on the beach.

1107
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:04,701
You're joking.

1108
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:07,133
If you
get away with it,

1109
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,634
everybody
will throw stones.

1110
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:11,100
The beach
will be destroyed.

1111
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:14,300
You want me to
go into the water

1112
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:16,634
and find that rock?

1113
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:18,901
Yes. Or you
and your son

1114
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:21,067
have to leave
the beach.

1115
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,467
Are you
going to dust
for fingerprints

1116
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:27,067
and find out
which one's mine?

1117
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,534
Find a stone
similar

1118
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:30,534
to the stone
you threw

1119
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,968
and put that
back on the beach.

1120
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,834
O.k. Fine.

1121
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,834

You can have it.

a rock.

1125

Here's a rock

1126

of similar size
and weight.

1127
00:54:49,968 --> 00:54:51,601
Call the Sierra club.

The rock is back.

1129
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:55,934
That's it.
I'm sorry,
but technically

1130
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:58,934
that rock
was still
on the beach.

1131
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:01,501
Wade out.
Pick up a rock.

1132
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:04,467
Or would you
prefer I call

1133
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,133
the harbor patrol?

The harbor patrol?
Are you nuts?

1135
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:14,434
Will they show up
in a speedboat
and arrest me?

on something.

01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:36,834
pitch your tent
back up.

1436
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,100
Excuse me.

1437
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:45,234
Dad, it's o.K.

1438
01:08:52,534 --> 01:08:55,801
Guess you thought
that was funny.

1439
01:08:55,868 --> 01:08:57,234
What do you mean?

1440
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,067
You trashing my tent.

1441
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,067
Oh, that.

1442
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:02,300
It's a tradition
here.

1443
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:03,400
First-time
visitors

1444
01:09:03,467 --> 01:09:05,400
get their tents
trashed.

1445
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:07,334
I wouldn't take it
personally.

1446
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,133
Look, if you
don't like me, that's fine,

1447
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,267
but if you have
a problem,

1448
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:15,801
don't be a coward
and go after my son.

1449
01:09:19,267 --> 01:09:20,767
Let's just
forget about it.

1450
01:09:20,834 --> 01:09:23,234
We've had
such a nice night.

1451
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,834
Are you calling me
a coward?

1452
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:27,467
Only a coward
would do that

1453
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:30,334
to a kid.

1454
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,200
Dad, come on,
don't...

1455
01:09:32,267 --> 01:09:34,400
Let's not
start anything here.

1456
01:09:38,868 --> 01:09:40,601
O.k. Michael,
let's go.

1457
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:43,801
Are you running away?

1458
01:09:43,868 --> 01:09:45,200
Get out
of my way.

1459
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:49,567
[Aaron]
Stop it!

1460
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:51,267
Come on, guys.

1461
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:52,968
[Michael]
Stop!

1462
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:54,467
[Aaron]
Break it up.

1463
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:57,067
Stop it!

1464
01:09:57,133 --> 01:09:58,667
[Scoutmaster]
All right, guys,

1465
01:09:58,734 --> 01:10:01,067
I'm not having
any of this.

1466
01:10:01,133 --> 01:10:02,767
Get up.

1467
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:04,067
Get up.

1468
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,133
Stop. Stop.
Stop!

1469
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:11,868
[Scoutmaster]
All right, Mr. Paley,

1470
01:10:11,934 --> 01:10:13,601
let's go to first aid

1471
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,701
and patch you up again.

1472
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,534
I'm fine, Michael.

1473
01:10:23,501 --> 01:10:24,868
Michael!

1474
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:26,667
[Aaron]
I'll go
after Michael.

1475
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:27,901
Get your nose
fixed.

1476
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:29,601
You're not
the first person
who's suggested that.

1477
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,901
You know, Mr. Paley,

1478
01:10:34,968 --> 01:10:37,634
I'm starting to hope

1479
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:40,300
that you don't
come back again next year

1480
01:10:40,367 --> 01:10:42,167
because this camp
can't afford

1481
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:45,901
to take care of you
for another weekend.

1482
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:56,267
Michael,
where were you?
I was worried.

1483
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:59,734
I took a walk.

1484
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:02,734
You want to go
canoeing tomorrow?

1485
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:04,501
That last time was
a freak accident.

1486
01:11:04,567 --> 01:11:06,767
Forget it.

1487
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,100
How about archery,
then?

1488
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:11,367
We didn't really
focus on it before.

1489
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,767
The zen thing
was fun.

1490
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,934
I want to go home.

1491
01:11:17,133 --> 01:11:19,767
Why? We've still got
another day.

1492
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:22,067
I want to go home!

1493
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:49,100
En garde, dad.

1494
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:52,067
Oh!

1495
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:07,067
Hey, Michael...

1496
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,067
Look,
I've been a jerk
this weekend.

1497
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,067
I know that.

1498
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:17,968
I'm not that good
at this dad stuff,

1499
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:21,667
but if there's one thing
I've learned this weekend,

1500
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:23,868
I've realized
it doesn't matter

1501
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:26,701
what happened to me
as a kid.

1502
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:30,400
I'm here to help you
become a man.

1503
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:34,501
I'm scared that
if you and I

1504
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:38,067
don't work this out
while you're still my boy,

1505
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:41,067
one day you'll have to
come back here

1506
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,767
or a place like this
by yourself.

1507
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:48,067
Look, dad,
I don't want to
hear about it.

1508
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:49,300
Listen to me.

1509
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:51,067
You might not
understand

1510
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:54,067
what I'm trying
to tell you,

1511
01:12:54,067 --> 01:12:56,067
but sorting
this stuff out

1512
01:12:56,067 --> 01:12:58,067
when you're
a grownup--

1513
01:12:58,067 --> 01:13:01,467
it's harder
than you can imagine.

1514
01:13:01,534 --> 01:13:04,100
I still want
to go home.

1515
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:06,400
Look...

1516
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:08,634
If I go
in the mine

1517
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:10,601
and we look
for treasure,

1518
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:12,434
will you finish
the weekend?

1519
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:13,934
You'll just
faint again.

1520
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:16,400
Then I'll sniff
my smelling salts

1521
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:19,100
and pull myself
together.

1522
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:21,534
I want us
to find that treasure.

1523
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,133
You two going back?

1524
01:13:36,067 --> 01:13:37,801
O.k.

1525
01:13:39,234 --> 01:13:41,067
Thank you.

1526
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,801
We've changed
our minds.

1527
01:13:46,868 --> 01:13:49,067
That will still be $3.00.

1528
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:55,067
No problem.

1529
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:56,868
Each.

1530
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:02,067
All right,
here you go.

1531
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:04,701
That's a good boy
you got.

1532
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:06,367
You're lucky.

1533
01:14:09,801 --> 01:14:11,868
I know.

1534
01:14:11,934 --> 01:14:14,701
Just in case.

1535
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:16,100
Thanks.

1536
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:18,067
O.k., Michael,
let's go.

1537
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:21,234
Michael?

1538
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,067
Michael, you know,
you could help me.

1539
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:26,067
You could help me
sometimes.

1540
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:29,601
Just grab
a sleeping bag.

1541
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:53,067
You have 30 minutes.

1542
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,734
Watch out for bats.

1543
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:57,200
May the best pair win.

1544
01:14:57,267 --> 01:14:59,300
[Tweet]

1545
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:02,067
Let's go! Let's go!

1546
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,801
Let's go!

1547
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,067
I'm right
behind you,
buddy.

1548
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:21,400
Aw, again.
Again.

1549
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,067
Watch your head,
dad.

1550
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:32,234
Are you o.K.?

1551
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,067
Yeah, I'm fine,
Michael.

1552
01:15:35,133 --> 01:15:36,934
Should we
go back?

1553
01:15:37,067 --> 01:15:38,234
No.

1554
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,367
No. Let's keep going.

1555
01:16:02,234 --> 01:16:03,868
Dad, look.

1556
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,167
These boards
are loose.

1557
01:16:05,234 --> 01:16:08,534
They might be
holding this place up.

1558
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,701
There's
another tunnel
in here.

1559
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:16,400
Yeah. Let's
keep going,
o.K., Michael?

1560
01:16:16,467 --> 01:16:17,934
Somebody stuck
these here.

1561
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:19,300
They're
not nailed.

1562
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,801
Leave them alone.

1563
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:24,434
The treasure's here.
These boards
are to fool us.

1564
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:27,534
This isn't
a good idea.

1565
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:29,834
Michael.

1566
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:32,167
I'm positive.
Come on.

1567
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:33,868
Come on, dad.

1568
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:35,167
Michael!

1569
01:16:35,234 --> 01:16:37,167
Michael...

1570
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:39,601
Michael!

1571
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:42,834
Come on, dad.
Down here.

1572
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:46,334
Michael,
maybe we should
be heading back.

1573
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,634
I'm sure
it's down here.

1574
01:16:48,701 --> 01:16:50,601
Agh!

1575
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:52,801
What's wrong?

1576
01:16:52,868 --> 01:16:54,300
Just a spider web.

1577
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:55,934
Remember,
your mother

1578
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:57,901
would be going
nuts now.

1579
01:16:57,968 --> 01:17:00,133
Let's go.

1580
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,067
Is the tunnel
getting narrower?

1581
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,067
I see a light.

1582
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,067
That's exciting.
Don't move.

1583
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:10,667
You can kill it
with this.

1584
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:12,701
No, I can't.

1585
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:14,367
O.k. Here.

1586
01:17:16,234 --> 01:17:18,868
What kind of
snake is that?

1587
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,868
Looks like
a kingsnake.

1588
01:17:20,934 --> 01:17:22,534
Great.
That relaxes me.

1589
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:25,501
All right!

1590
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:26,968
Did I kill it?

1591
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:29,133
Here.

1592
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,133
Don't pick
it up!

1593
01:17:32,968 --> 01:17:34,434
It's rubber.

1594
01:17:34,501 --> 01:17:36,601
What?

1595
01:17:40,434 --> 01:17:42,400
Well, somebody's
going to get
sued.

1596
01:17:43,434 --> 01:17:46,367
They put it there
to scare us.

1597
01:17:46,434 --> 01:17:48,367
We're
in the right place.

1598
01:17:48,434 --> 01:17:49,868
I think
you're right.

1599
01:17:49,934 --> 01:17:51,167
Excellent, dude.

1600
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,534
Cool!

1601
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,601
Let's go.

1602
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:03,100
Cool.

1603
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:06,133
This is
the first mine
I've seen

1604
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,434
that wasn't built
by Spielberg.

1605
01:18:11,067 --> 01:18:12,067
Look at that.

1606
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,100
Looks like
someone lived here.

1607
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,767
Yeah, but
not recently.
Look.

1608
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:20,300
Roast mutton.

1609
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:22,067
Hey, look.

1610
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,434
Somebody's
a real comedian.

1611
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:27,367
Ah!

1612
01:18:33,067 --> 01:18:34,767
Michael.

1613
01:18:36,868 --> 01:18:38,501
Treasure.

1614
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:42,467
Ha ha ha!

1615
01:18:42,534 --> 01:18:43,767
Real gold!

1616
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:46,767
Well, I don't know
about that, son.

1617
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:48,801
Look.

1618
01:18:48,868 --> 01:18:50,934
Here you go.

1619
01:18:51,067 --> 01:18:52,634
What do
you think?

1620
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:55,100
Delicious.

1621
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:58,868
We found it.

1622
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,801
All right!

1623
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:03,100
We were here
first.

1624
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,133
That's true.

1625
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,067
You can't
have it.

1626
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:09,501
What are you
doing? Hey--

1627
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,067
uh!

1628
01:19:13,133 --> 01:19:15,234
Aagh!

1629
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,067
Ow!

1630
01:19:21,634 --> 01:19:23,667
Uh!

1631
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:39,934
Aah!

1632
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:41,968
Agh!

1633
01:19:42,067 --> 01:19:44,367
Uh!

1634
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:52,334
Get off me!

1635
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:57,400
Dad! Dad!

1636
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:59,634
Dad, are you o.K.?

1637
01:19:59,701 --> 01:20:02,267
Hey, answer me!

1638
01:20:02,334 --> 01:20:04,400
Aah!

1639
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:06,434
Get them! Get them!

1640
01:20:10,734 --> 01:20:12,934
Michael,
are you o.K.?

1641
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,868
I think.

1642
01:20:14,934 --> 01:20:16,434
Chip?

1643
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:18,267
Dad,
are you o.K.?

1644
01:20:18,334 --> 01:20:19,367
Yeah. Are you?

1645
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:20,667
Yeah.

1646
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:22,067
How about you?

1647
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:25,133
I don't know.
I think I'm stuck.

1648
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,801
How about you?

1649
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:28,234
I think I'm fine.

1650
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,968
Dad, where are we?

1651
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,267
I don't know.

1652
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:34,534
Hold on.
Let me get around here...

1653
01:20:34,601 --> 01:20:36,200
Get around, chip.

1654
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:39,100
Wait a minute.

1655
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,167
Whoa.

1656
01:20:40,234 --> 01:20:42,167
Don't anybody
look down.

1657
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:45,133
We're in some sort
of cavern...

1658
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,133
A very deep cavern.

1659
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,267
[Crack]

1660
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:51,400
Let's get off
this ledge.

1661
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:53,067
I'm scared, dad.

1662
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:55,467
We'll get you
out of here.

1663
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:58,300
All right, everybody
just stay calm.

1664
01:20:58,367 --> 01:21:01,467
You're the fireman.
What do we do?

1665
01:21:01,534 --> 01:21:02,934
[Wood cracks]

1666
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,434
This won't hold
our weight long.

1667
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:09,234
Are we going to die,
dad?

1668
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,300
No. No.
No, we're not.

1669
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:17,067
Uh...o.k.,
see that timber?

1670
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:19,267
If I slide it over,

1671
01:21:19,334 --> 01:21:21,434
maybe I can get
your leg out

1672
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,534
and boost you up.

1673
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:25,067
O.k., let's go.

1674
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:27,200
Hold
this flashlight.

1675
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:29,167
Don't take it off,
o.K.?

1676
01:21:29,234 --> 01:21:31,434
Shine it right
on his foot.

1677
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:33,434
You guys
hug the wall.

1678
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:35,133
[Wood bangs]

1679
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,267
Hold on.

1680
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,267
O.k.

1681
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,767
Hold on.

1682
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,868
1, 2, 3.

1683
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:53,634
Aah!

1684
01:21:56,501 --> 01:21:59,434
O.k., can you put
your weight on it?

1685
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:03,267
I don't know yet.
I think so.

1686
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:09,133
Come on.
We got to hurry.

1687
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,934
Can you put
weight on it?

1688
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:12,334
Yeah.

1689
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,367
I'll boost you out.

1690
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:16,634
You can get
the kids out.

1691
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:19,300
Hold each other.

1692
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,334
Let's move it.
Come on.

1693
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,234
Wait a minute.
O.K.

1694
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,801
1, 2...

1695
01:22:26,868 --> 01:22:28,734
Uh!

1696
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:30,901
O.k.

1697
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,534
You o.K.?

1698
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:36,067
I got you.

1699
01:22:36,133 --> 01:22:38,367
You're
doing great.

1700
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,901
Be careful, dad.

1701
01:22:44,968 --> 01:22:47,133
Careful, now.

1702
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,534
O.k.

1703
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:50,234
Got it?

1704
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,067
Yeah.

1705
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,534
Do it. Push.

1706
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,534
You ready?

1707
01:22:55,601 --> 01:22:58,467
1, 2, 3!

1708
01:22:58,534 --> 01:23:02,901
Uh!

1709
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,634
I got it.

1710
01:23:08,701 --> 01:23:10,334
Pull yourself up.

1711
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,200
Get your other
foot up.

1712
01:23:12,267 --> 01:23:13,534
O.k., o.K.

1713
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:16,300
Get the boys.

1714
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:18,234
Pass me the boys,
quick.

1715
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,400
Come on, chip.

1716
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:21,267
Michael,
hold this.

1717
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:22,267
O.k.

1718
01:23:22,334 --> 01:23:23,534
I got it.

1719
01:23:23,601 --> 01:23:24,767
Come on.

1720
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,467
Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

1721
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,234
Hold on
to that peg there.

1722
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,534
You o.K., Michael?

1723
01:23:30,601 --> 01:23:33,234
Chip, just keep
looking up here.

1724
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,767
I got you, man.

1725
01:23:34,834 --> 01:23:36,534
A little more, son.

1726
01:23:36,601 --> 01:23:39,367
Careful
the way you're
straddling this.

1727
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:41,400
Don't get
a splinter.

1728
01:23:41,467 --> 01:23:43,100
All right,
that's it.

1729
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:44,634
That's it,
buddy.

1730
01:23:44,701 --> 01:23:46,334
Give me your hand.

1731
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,234
Right here, buddy.

1732
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,267
O.k.!

1733
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:51,968
Got him?

1734
01:23:52,067 --> 01:23:54,267
Yeah, I got him.

1735
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:56,367
We're almost
out of here.

1736
01:23:56,434 --> 01:23:59,534
Give me the light.
O.K., hold on.

1737
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:02,200
Come over here,
son. O.K.

1738
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,367
Dad!

1739
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,534
I'm scared, dad.

1740
01:24:08,601 --> 01:24:10,634
You're fine.
I got you.

1741
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:12,501
Chet, don't leave.

1742
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:15,234
We're out of here.
Come on.

1743
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,367
There you go.
Keep going.

1744
01:24:17,434 --> 01:24:18,534
Take my hand.

1745
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:20,267
Pull yourself up.

1746
01:24:20,334 --> 01:24:21,901
Up.

1747
01:24:23,734 --> 01:24:26,234
You can do it. O.K.

1748
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,667
Pull yourself up.

1749
01:24:27,734 --> 01:24:30,300
A couple more feet.

1750
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:31,334
You're almost
out of here.

1751
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,334
Grab ahold
of Chet's hand.

1752
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,667
That's it, son.

1753
01:24:35,734 --> 01:24:37,167
I got him.

1754
01:24:39,834 --> 01:24:42,100
O.k., spenser.
Give me your hand.

1755
01:24:42,167 --> 01:24:43,901
I love
a camping trip.

1756
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:47,634
I got you.

1757
01:24:47,701 --> 01:24:48,901
Come on, dad.

1758
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,934
Dad!

1759
01:25:11,133 --> 01:25:12,434
Let's get out of here.

1760
01:25:14,601 --> 01:25:15,934
Hey...

1761
01:25:17,734 --> 01:25:22,734
You, uh...
Saved my kid's life.

1762
01:25:22,801 --> 01:25:24,200
Thanks.

1763
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:31,367
Let's go, son.

1764
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,901
[Scoutmaster]
And the treasure hunt
winners are...

1765
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:39,667
Michael Paley
and his dad spenser!

1766
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,901
Come on up, now.
Come on up.

1767
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:47,701
Your names
will be engraved

1768
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,400
on our perpetual
plaque,

1769
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:51,701
and it will be
displayed
prominently

1770
01:25:51,767 --> 01:25:54,400
in the lobby
of the school

1771
01:25:54,467 --> 01:25:55,901
for everyone
to see.

1772
01:25:55,968 --> 01:25:57,334
Now...

1773
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,634
Spense! Spense!
Spense!

1774
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:02,534
Now, this year,
we have

1775
01:26:02,601 --> 01:26:05,634
a special award
for heroism.

1776
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:08,667
In recognition
of their courage,

1777
01:26:08,734 --> 01:26:10,267
we're giving
the paleys

1778
01:26:10,334 --> 01:26:15,067
each a special medal
for bravery...

1779
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,367
Thank you.

1780
01:26:16,434 --> 01:26:17,968
And service to their
fellow campers.

1781
01:26:18,467 --> 01:26:20,133
All right!

1782
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,434
Congratulations.

1783
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,934
Way to go,
spense.

1784
01:26:28,067 --> 01:26:29,367
Thanks, dude.

1785
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,901
I'm going to
miss you guys.

1786
01:26:30,968 --> 01:26:32,734
Maybe we'll do it
again next year.

1787
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:34,534
Ha ha ha!

1788
01:26:42,434 --> 01:26:44,534
No hard feelings?

1789
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:47,534
No.

1790
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:51,567
Acting like a wimp
doesn't mean
you are one.

1791
01:26:51,634 --> 01:26:53,968
Acting like a macho--

1792
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:58,234
let me put it
another way.

1793
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,300
I understand
why this place

1794
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:02,534
means so much to you.

1795
01:27:02,601 --> 01:27:05,067
It means a lot to me,
too, now.

1796
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,467
I'm glad.

1797
01:27:06,534 --> 01:27:09,067
It's the place
where I had the worst
scrambled eggs ever.

1798
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:13,067
Men, let's get
this gear

1799
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,634
to the truck.
Everybody pitches in. Come on!

1800
01:27:17,701 --> 01:27:19,534
Let's go!

1801
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:22,200
Michael! Michael!

1802
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:24,234
We fell down
a secret passageway

1803
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,534
and got stuck
in a cavern.

1804
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:31,334
We could have died,
but dad saved us.

1805
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,400
We got medals
for being heroes.

1806
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:35,367
Wow, that's great!

1807
01:27:35,434 --> 01:27:37,934
I'm not kidding.
It really happened.

1808
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:39,567
Well,
I believe you.

1809
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:41,767
She doesn't
believe us, dad.

1810
01:27:41,834 --> 01:27:44,067
That's her problem.
We both know what happened.

1811
01:27:44,067 --> 01:27:45,200
We know we're heroes.

1812
01:27:45,267 --> 01:27:47,968
Yeah, we know.

1813
01:27:48,067 --> 01:27:50,234
I said
I believed you.

1814
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,601
Look at the time.

1815
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,901
You got school tomorrow.
Time for bed.

1816
01:27:54,968 --> 01:27:56,234
O.k.

1817
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,467
I'll come
tuck you in.

1818
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:03,234
Mom, I don't need
to be tucked in anymore.

1819
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,701
I'm a hero.

1820
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,567
There isn't really
an abandoned mine

1821
01:28:10,634 --> 01:28:13,067
on Catalina island,
is there?

1822
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:16,400
Just a small one,
the normal kind--

1823
01:28:16,467 --> 01:28:18,167
dark, dank,
low ceilings, narrow,

1824
01:28:18,234 --> 01:28:20,234
dripping fluids
from the ceiling.

1825
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:24,167
And you went in there,
with your claustrophobia?

1826
01:28:24,234 --> 01:28:26,067
Actually, I got over it.

1827
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,501
It, uh, didn't really
bother me that much.

1828
01:28:29,567 --> 01:28:32,067
And you got
trapped in there

1829
01:28:32,067 --> 01:28:34,968
on a ledge over
a bottomless cavern,

1830
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:37,133
and you saved
Michael's life

1831
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,634
and the life of
another man and his son?

1832
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:43,200
I did what any
seasoned outdoorsman

1833
01:28:43,267 --> 01:28:44,367
would have done.

1834
01:28:44,434 --> 01:28:47,367
This isn't a psych,
is it?

1835
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:50,667
They gave me a medal,
didn't they?

1836
01:28:50,734 --> 01:28:54,167
Well, all right!

1837
01:28:54,234 --> 01:28:55,501
Ha ha ha!

1838
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:58,501
Does this mean
we can go camping

1839
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:00,267
in yosemite
this summer?

1840
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:02,067
With 10 million
other people

1841
01:29:02,067 --> 01:29:05,167
in motor homes
and generators
and lawn chairs?

1842
01:29:05,234 --> 01:29:08,300
O.k., I'll think
about it.

1843
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:10,200
I got to tell you.

1844
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:13,667
This was great.
It was like
a Greek myth.

1845
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:15,367
O.k., maybe
not exactly,

1846
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:18,334
but...i really want
to thank you

1847
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,067
for making me go.

1848
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,868
It was one
of the best things
you've done

1849
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:26,367
for Michael
and for me.

1850
01:29:26,434 --> 01:29:28,334
Thank you.

1851
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:31,567
Well, you're welcome.

1852
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:34,400
I'm proud of you.

1853
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:36,267
Thanks.

1854
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:38,067
This was just
the beginning.

1855
01:29:38,133 --> 01:29:41,567
Michael and I will
spend more guy time
together.

1856
01:29:41,634 --> 01:29:43,701
We'll go
to baseball games

1857
01:29:43,767 --> 01:29:45,400
and basketball
games.

1858
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:47,200
Great.
Michael will love that.

1859
01:29:47,267 --> 01:29:51,200
Next weekend,
we start our scuba
diving lessons.

1860
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,267
Let's check
on our kid.

1861
01:29:54,334 --> 01:29:56,767
Sc-scuba diving?

1862
01:29:56,834 --> 01:29:59,767
I'm glad
you guys bonded
and everything,

1863
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:03,567
but when I said
you should do
guy things,

1864
01:30:03,634 --> 01:30:06,767
I meant like
playing catch
in the driveway.

1865
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:09,133
Aw...

1866
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:32,934
Good night, pal.

1867
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:44,033
So what do you think
of white-water rafting?

1868
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,100
This is what
you always do--

1869
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:47,467
you get
a good idea

1870
01:30:47,534 --> 01:30:49,634
and go overboard
with it.

1871
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:52,300
It's a nice way to relax
after bungee jumping.

1872
01:30:52,367 --> 01:30:54,100
Let's talk
about this.
