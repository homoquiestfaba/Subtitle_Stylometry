00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,855
HAROLD ASAILIAN,
SR.: What do you

2
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,158
Want to do when you grow up?

3
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,494
[Chuckle]

4
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:33,301
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

5
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:38,606
Shakespeare.

6
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,374
Goddamn genius.

7
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,110
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: So
you like the classics, huh?

8
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,910
Hell, yeah.

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,078
That's where it's at, man.

10
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,380
I mean, my goal is to be Hamlet.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,282
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: That
would be quite a challenge.

12
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,583
Yeah, let me tell
you something.

13
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,154
I made for the classics.

14
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,355
[Moaning]

15
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,358
Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson.

16
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,827
Oh, God.

17
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,330
I got a cramp.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,297
OK, cut.

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,734
Cut, that's enough.

20
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:07,535
Towel.

21
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,337
[Background chatter]

22
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,574
You OK?

23
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,008
I'll be OK.

24
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,411
Mike, do you have
the Listerine?

25
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,312
No.

26
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,448
Who's got it?

27
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,383
Go check with [inaudible]

28
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,851
I'll be right back.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,360
Hi I'm Harold
Asailian, Jr. And I've

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,961
Just checked into
this hotel room

31
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,597
In Los Angeles, California.

32
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,934
16 years ago my father,
Dr. Harold Asailian, Sr.

33
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,736
Had a dream of
making a documentary

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,339
About an ordinary person's life.

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,841
His concept was to take
a six-year-old child

36
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,942
And film him.

37
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,445
And then film the same
child 16 years later

38
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:55,149
And see how he turned out, a
sort of anthropological study

39
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,150
Of an average person.

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,921
The child picked
for this project was

41
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,691
Rich Longfellow of Perry, Ohio.

42
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,693
My father chose young
Rich by randomly

43
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,428
Pulling is file
card from the office

44
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,563
Of a local elementary school.

45
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,566
He then sent a letter to Rich's
mother, explaining the project

46
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,802
And after meeting my
father, she gladly

47
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,038
Agreed to let him film her son.

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,341
My father's previous
experience as a filmmaker

49
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,211
Involved documenting
wild animals.

50
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,612
This was the first
time he'd ever made

51
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,046
A film about the human species.

52
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,418
This is Dr. Asailian,
the one I told you about.

53
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:31,652
He's a doctor?

54
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,953
Yes.

55
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,822
Is he going to give me a shot?

56
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:35,689
No.

57
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,158
No, I'm not that
kind of doctor.

58
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,528
As you see here, he
had a difficult time

59
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,862
Getting the child to open up.

60
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,331
I don't want to talk.

61
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,807
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: Before
he could develop a real rapport

62
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,110
With the young boy, my father
was temporarily called away

63
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,514
To work on a project with the
"National Geographic," where

64
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,916
In Mozambique, he was
trampled to death by a herd

65
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,219
Of migrating wildebeests.

66
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,821
A few days before his death,
he wrote this in his journal.

67
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,495
Upon leaving young Rich,
the subject of my film,

68
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,631
I feel that the child was
just about to open up to me

69
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,068
And finally tell me
everything he feels.

70
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,372
I'm looking forward to filming
him soon, after I complete

71
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,640
My duties here in Mozambique.

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,075
Bye, Dr. Asailian.

73
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:41,154
Obviously he never made it
back to realize his dream.

74
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,257
But it's 16 years
later, and I've

75
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:48,529
Decided to pay homage to my
father and complete his dream.

76
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,266
Using his actual camera, I took
a leave of absence from my job

77
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,468
At the Perry Department
of Water and Power

78
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,405
And enrolled in a film class
of Perry Community College

79
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:01,309
With Professor Amec Johnson, a
fine filmmaker his own right.

80
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,010
Professor Johnson
agreed to let me shoot

81
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,413
This as my big class project.

82
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:08,849
So I located Rich
Longfellow, now age 23,

83
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,552
And found them in
sunny Los Angeles.

84
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,087
I'd never met Rich before and
when we finally got together,

85
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,255
We really hit it off.

86
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,189
REO Speedwagon.

87
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,925
Hey, you like the
oldies too, huh?

88
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,027
Yeah, I like 'em.

89
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,830
(SINGING) Time for me to fly.

90
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,764
Yeah.

91
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,199
I'm gonna keep on lovin' you...

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,504
Today, Rich is an actor and
a newcomer in the business.

93
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,206
He's just moved out from
Ohio only three months ago

94
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,608
And he's graciously
agreed to let

95
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,512
Me film him, his
life, and all those

96
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,547
Who surround his environment.

97
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:49,189
Well, here I am,
ready to make my film.

98
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,625
Before I start though,
I'd like to say

99
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,962
Something on a personal
note to my father.

100
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:59,132
Dad, I hope this film
makes you proud of me.

101
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:18,218
This is for you, Dr.
Harold Asailian, Sr.

102
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,355
When we first met, you
told me that a career plan.

103
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,358
Can tell me a little
about that Now

104
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,995
Sure, I figure I'll do a
couple more adult videos.

105
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:31,298
Then I'll do some major
movies here in Hollywood.

106
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:38,338
And I figure, maybe in about six
months, Shakespeare at the Old

107
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,273
Globe in London, England.

108
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,643
OK, so we have some of your
Shakespeare stuff set up here.

109
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,711
You want to show it to me?

110
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,045
Yeah, sure.

111
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,515
I got this book here,
the Shakespeare book.

112
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,849
It's got photos.

113
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,186
It's got... there's a good
picture of when he was young.

114
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,388
Yeah, here it is.

115
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,489
This is the man himself.

116
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,657
That's Shakespeare right there.

117
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:57,825
That's a young picture of him.

118
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:58,626
Nice.

119
00:05:58,726 --> 00:05:59,593
Isn't he cool looking?

120
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,728
Yeah.
Handsome guy.

121
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:01,529
Yeah.

122
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,030
And I got... look at that.

123
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,998
I got this.

124
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,400
That's a cover from the movie.

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,769
It's a publicity
still, they call it.

126
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,770
That's Laurence Olivier.

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,771
This is Hamlet.

128
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,272
Do you think he
was a good Hamlet?

129
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,174
Yeah, well, he's my idol.

130
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,909
That guy.

131
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,210
This is wiener dog.

132
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,379
That doesn't belong.

133
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,514
Check this out.

134
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,949
Shakespeare coloring book.

135
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,083
Oh, that's great.

136
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,887
That's supposed to be
Shakespeare right there.

137
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,322
[Inaudible]

138
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,291
And then I did that.

139
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,761
See how I painted that,
colored that purple.

140
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:34,995
Is it finished yet?

141
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:35,996
No, it's not finished.

142
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,365
I've got to still
do this and that.

143
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,834
Check this out.

144
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,636
That's a sword just like his.

145
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,071
Bet I can do that.

146
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,839
Oh, yeah, that looks good.

147
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,074
Would you want
to play that role?

148
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,276
Yeah, if I can use
my sword, I can.

149
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,077
Yeah.

150
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,115
Yeah, this is the place.

151
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,193
Gwen.

152
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,628
Gwen.

153
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,096
Are you Rich?

154
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,197
Rich, this is Gwen.

155
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,131
Hi.

156
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,633
Hi, it's really
nice to meet you.

157
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,567
Nice to meet you.

158
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,868
I've seen a couple
of your films.

159
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,336
OK.

160
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,672
I've put a sign up,
saying the laundry

161
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,241
Room is under repair today,
so no one should bother you.

162
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,743
Excellent.

163
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,778
This is just like a
typical day on the job, huh?

164
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,579
Yeah.

165
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,115
I got the acting bug.

166
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,951
So, interesting people
that you're surrounded by.

167
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,385
Yeah, I've been really lucky.

168
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,788
They're really cool people.

169
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,858
OK, you guys come on down here.

170
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,361
Just go right down these stairs.

171
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,732
All right, we're here.

172
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:45,699
What do you think?

173
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,339
[Inaudible]

174
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,613
As far as my character
goes, am I shocked?

175
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,049
Or do you want me to pretend to
be surprised when he comes in?

176
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,183
No.

177
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,853
You're just basically
really turned on, OK?

178
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,022
That's pretty much
what it's all about.

179
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,924
Let me ask you, is it
strange at all to have sex

180
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,260
With someone you don't know?

181
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,095
It's no big deal.

182
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,097
Most of the time,
I'm not even turned

183
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,568
On by the guy or the girl,
but I just rise above it

184
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,570
And act my part.

185
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,540
Take your clothes off and
put them in the washer.

186
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,010
How about if I take your clothes
off and put them in the washer?

187
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,980
Action.

188
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,484
Hi, um, you didn't happen to
find a sock in there, did you?

189
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,953
I'm always losing my socks.

190
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,622
No, but go ahead and check.

191
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,422
Thanks.

192
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,896
Oh, is this what
you're looking for?

193
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,866
Although it's kind
of big to be a sock.

194
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,367
I don't see it, so...

195
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,051
Oh, Rich.

196
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,720
Ah, this character's
name is Bob.

197
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,555
OK, oh, Bob.

198
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,190
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Rich's youthful enthusiasm

199
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,659
Was amazing.

200
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,662
After shooting the same
scenes for hours on end,

201
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,030
He wanted to spend
the rest of the day

202
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,898
Studying some of
the more established

203
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,235
Veterans in the business.

204
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,670
Ah, that didn't quite work.

205
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,039
Can we do it one more time?

206
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,306
[Kissing sounds]

207
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,809
[Moaning]

208
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:41,649
That's Rod Blank.

209
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,851
He's the best in the business.

210
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,518
I'm trying to learn from him.

211
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,087
Shh, quite on the set, please.

212
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:47,888
[Moaning]

213
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,223
Oh, baby.

214
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,493
Let us go to my
friend's chateau.

215
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,096
Where we will drink some wine.

216
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:56,897
Fromage.

217
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,669
And passion.

218
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,605
[Moaning and kissing sounds]

219
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,406
Cut.

220
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,375
What's with the accent, Rod?

221
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,077
It is a French accent.

222
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,179
I have been working on it.

223
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,513
Just do it normal, all right?

224
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,848
You don't need an accent.

225
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,017
But look, this
is a French movie.

226
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,619
Yeah, we're dubbing it
to an American audience.

227
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,791
But my character is supposed
to be of the French persuasion.

228
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:28,395
What do you find to be most
challenging doing voice overs?

229
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:33,366
Well, capturing the essence
of the culture you're doing

230
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,835
Is extremely important.

231
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,972
For example, French passion
may sound something like, ooh.

232
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:47,080
Whereas in Germany,
it sounds like ooh.

233
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,751
So then subtitles would
be out of the question.

234
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,420
Love making is an
international language.

235
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,354
It doesn't need subtitles.

236
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,429
So maybe you could talk
about yourself a little bit,

237
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,165
And your background
and then mention Rich.

238
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,433
You want me to talk, huh?

239
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,135
Sure.

240
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,237
Well, let's see.

241
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,674
My name is Lee Fernandez.

242
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,911
I'm the producer of
Rich's the latest movie.

243
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,249
Rich is a good kid.

244
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,651
He just recently
started working for me.

245
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:28,488
And I take full credit
for discovering him too.

246
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,524
I mean this could be
actually one of the greatest

247
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,995
Discovery stories of all time.

248
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:35,829
Want some?

249
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,664
No thanks.

250
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:41,134
Let's see, I um, I
went into the men's

251
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,671
Room to use the urinal.

252
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,707
I noticed next to
me is this kid.

253
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,177
I could tell right
away he was talented,

254
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,813
So I start talking to him.

255
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:57,818
Come to find out, he's a young
actor, looking for experience.

256
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,652
Let me tell you something
about Rich Longfellow.

257
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,855
You keep your eye on him,
because he's going to be big.

258
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,826
I mean, he's got that, got
that certain special something

259
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,527
You know that makes him
stand out in this business.

260
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,763
How long have you
been making movies?

261
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:14,701
Well, made my first
one about 13 years ago.

262
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,570
Was that a porno?

263
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,973
Well, you see, I do
public service films,

264
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,209
For people, to help them
enhance their lives.

265
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,611
I mean, these movies
benefit the public.

266
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,746
Right now, we're
working on something

267
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,982
That's selling like hotcakes.

268
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,920
It's called America's
Home Made Sex Videos.

269
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,954
What's that?

270
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,556
Well, they're
amateur sex movies,

271
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,126
They were made at home
by everyday people

272
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,561
On their home video cameras.

273
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,963
They're very popular.

274
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,597
And where do you
get the video's from?

275
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,399
Well, we make 'em.

276
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,634
Didn't you say that
they're supposed

277
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,570
To be made by amateurs,
like average people?

278
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,704
Well, who'll know
the difference?

279
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:55,542
I mean, besides, we're
average people too.

280
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,277
I mean, it'll look
very realistic.

281
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,246
Nobody know the difference.

282
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,114
Hi, I'm Ed Jones.

283
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,116
This is my new bride, Thelma.

284
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,652
Hi, we just got back
from our honeymoon

285
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,120
And opened up our gifts.

286
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,455
And what do you know?

287
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,523
We got a video camera.

288
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,259
Well, honey, I
finally figured out how

289
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,726
To use our new video equipment.
You did?

290
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,095
Good.

291
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,697
'Cause I'm real horny Let's
get one in before the neighbors

292
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,899
Arrive for pot luck.

293
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,268
You betcha.

294
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,603
[Moaning]

295
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,640
Lee's is a real nice guy.

296
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,677
And well, he's kind of like
the father I never had.

297
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,812
When I first came out
here, he was the only one

298
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,281
That believed in me.

299
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,049
This is my man right here.

300
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:36,984
This is my man.

301
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,786
[Chuckling]

302
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,754
You ever get shy on the set?

303
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,225
I guess at first I was a little
shy about doing nude scenes,

304
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,528
But after a while, I
got used to it and Lee,

305
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,463
He makes you feel comfortable.

306
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,066
I figured I needed some
experience on my resume,

307
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,701
Some acting on my resume.

308
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,670
Well, he told me about to
Othello, the nude scenes

309
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,239
In Othello. 'Cause I
told them about how

310
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,974
I wanted to do Shakespeare.

311
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,575
I figured acting was acting.

312
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:16,556
[Knocking]

313
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,824
Hey, Rich.

314
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:18,625
Good, morning.

315
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,260
How are you?

316
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,062
I'll be with you in
a sec, all right?

317
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,030
Let me finish this.

318
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,830
OK.

319
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,799
Then we'll go.

320
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,601
Feel free to walk
around if you like.

321
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,536
OK.

322
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,371
Have you heard
anything from Lee?

323
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,040
No, he didn't say
anything to me.

324
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,207
Did you read the script yet?

325
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,108
Yeah, it's a great script.

326
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:35,909
Hope I get it.

327
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,477
Good.

328
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,879
Oh, that's Betsy.

330
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,114
- Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,215
Are you the film guy?

332
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,316
Yeah.

333
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,153
That's cool.

334
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,054
I'm Betsy.

335
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,157
Oh, Harold, nice to meet you.

336
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:55,562
I met Betsy about a month ago
and she's my first girlfriend.

337
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,297
I almost had a girlfriend
in high school,

338
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,267
But that girl wouldn't
go out with me.

339
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,603
How does Betsy feel about
you doing sex scenes?

340
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,840
Well, uh, I think that's what
she likes about me, because I'm

341
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,343
An up and coming movie star.

342
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,312
Has she actually seen
any of your movies?

343
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,680
Hey, honey.

344
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,949
Here's your orange
juice, freshly squeezed.

345
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,017
Did you filter out the pulp?

346
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,119
Yep.

347
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:19,886
LM372AKR26.

348
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:22,689
F13U12C62.

349
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,865
What's that?

350
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,268
Oh, that's kind of personal.

351
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:38,138
But um, T125L.

352
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,073
That means you're
so sweet to me.

353
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,908
Well, uh, T125F.

354
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,381
That means, you deserve it.

355
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,382
[Phone rings]

356
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,883
Oh, D43N?

357
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,988
Oh, sure, honey, excuse me.

358
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,657
So, you've been together
with Rich about a month now?

359
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,026
Uh, huh.

360
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,793
I have my own apartment but I
was thinking in a few weeks,

361
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,029
We'd move in together.

362
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,430
I haven't told him yet.

363
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,633
RICH: Hey, Blane, what's up?

364
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,202
Oh, we were feeding ducks
by the artificial pond

365
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,403
In Culver City.

366
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,539
It's something we do
every Sunday now together.

367
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,440
That's nice.

368
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,774
Yeah!

369
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,144
Well, how do you feel about
him doing these sex scenes?

370
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,511
I'm sorry, what?

371
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,648
How do you feel about Rich
doing sex scenes on the set?

372
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,283
Um, it's just something
he's doing temporarily.

373
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,517
I'll get him out of it.

374
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,352
RICH: Whew!

375
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,553
You know my friend, Duane?

376
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,920
The one I told you about?

377
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,722
He's coming in from Sandusky.

378
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,324
Oh, man, it's going to be great.

379
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,959
He's going to stay here.

380
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,527
I'm glad it pleases
you, Richard.

381
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,763
Betsy's wonderful.

382
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,365
She seems really nice.

383
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,799
Yeah, it's funny.

384
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,536
The first time that I met her,
seen her at the duck pond.

385
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,772
And I wanted to go
talk to her, but I

386
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,340
Was just a little too nervous.

387
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,177
And I just kept on throwing
bread and next thing I knew,

388
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,145
She comes over to me.

389
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,714
And like I was still
a little nervous.

390
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,084
But we go along so well.

391
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,086
And she asked me
for my phone number.

392
00:16:59,186 --> 00:16:59,886
Really?

393
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:00,687
Yeah.

394
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:10,363
You don't have to do this
now if you don't want to.

395
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,665
I think she'd want me to.

396
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,938
That's my mother.

397
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,973
She passed away
about two years ago.

398
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,747
This is my favorite
picture of her.

399
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,817
It was only until I got older,
and I realized how hard it was

400
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,919
For her to raise me on her own.

401
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,858
She's the one that took me
to my first Shakespeare play

402
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,995
And at first, I admit I was
a little reluctant to go.

403
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:43,796
Get up.

404
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,597
Come on.

405
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,732
Come on.

406
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,534
We went and saw Hamlet.

407
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:53,506
And it was magic.

408
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,676
I didn't understand a single
word they were saying,

409
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,112
But I understood everything.

410
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:02,915
All I remember is
running out and saying,

411
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,384
I want to be Hamlet.

412
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,185
I want to be Hamlet.

413
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,959
And one day, I came home from
school, it was dinnertime

414
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,697
And there was this
cup by my dinner plate

415
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:23,136
And I asked my mom,
what's this cup about?

416
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:27,440
And she said that,
this is a magic goblet

417
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,843
And you have a magic gift.

418
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,281
And someday, you going to
be the Prince of Denmark.

419
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,426
I'm going to make it.

420
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,972
Well, wish me good luck.

421
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,308
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Rich is on his way

422
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,643
To meet with one of the
hottest directors in porn

423
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,013
Today, Carmichael
Astune, director of Lee

424
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,482
Fernandez's next production.

425
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,950
Earlier in the
morning, Rich showed

426
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,985
Me a secret script
of the project,

427
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,389
Which is currently untitled.

428
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,459
A huge step up from the
so-called amateur videos,

429
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,263
This is a big budget, feature
length, two part series,

430
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,131
Complete with three
acts, costumes,

431
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:28,201
Sets, and overseas distribution.

432
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,769
Rich is convinced
that working on it

433
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,838
Will be the greatest
training he's ever received.

434
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,209
Rich, I'm glad
you could come in.

435
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,244
It's good to meet you finally.

436
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,779
It's nice to meet
you too, Mr. Astune.

437
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,581
Please call me Carmichael.

438
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,416
I been looking at some
of your work lately.

439
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,451
It looks really good.

440
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,552
I'm impressed.

441
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,854
You have a real sense
of inner continuity.

442
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,890
So what do you think about
illuminating your potential.

443
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,859
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: Carmichael
Astune's greatest triumph

444
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,995
As a director, came at the
helm of such period uplinks

445
00:19:56,095 --> 00:20:00,367
As "Spartacome" and
"Pilgrim Poontang."

446
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,969
He considers himself
an actor's director,

447
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,572
And was quite eager to
demonstrate this for us.

448
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,875
[Loud moaning]

449
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,042
No, you're losing
the illumination.

450
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,644
[Moaning]

451
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,979
That's perfect.

452
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,046
Were you filming?

453
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,716
If you felt it,
then it is reality.

454
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,985
You see?

455
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:23,189
You are capable of
feeling that way.

456
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,925
And that's the beauty of film.

457
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:30,229
That's why I'm a film auteur.

458
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,366
He's brilliant.

459
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:38,338
I've never met anyone
like that before.

460
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:43,743
He just... the man
qualifies as an artist.

461
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,079
I get to work with
Carmichael, it'll

462
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,449
Get me that much closer
to the Shakespearean

463
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,752
Classical training that I need.

464
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,986
HAROLD ASAILIAN,
JR.: Apparently Rich

465
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,356
Was a top contender for
a part in the project,

466
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,257
But Lee and
Carmichael were still

467
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,159
Considering others
for the part and held

468
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,294
Some last minute auditions.

469
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:04,697
Well, I played Tevye in
"Fiddler On the Roof."

470
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,899
And I was the corpse in
"Arsenic and Old Lace."

471
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:07,767
Ah, sounds good.

472
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,035
Plenty of stage work, huh?

473
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:10,136
Oh, yeah, it's great training.

474
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,137
Good, good.

475
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,039
So, you feel ready
to try a reading?

476
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:13,806
Sure.

477
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:16,776
OK, turn to page nine.

478
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,746
Start at the top and
whenever you're ready.

479
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:31,023
I've never wanted
a woman so badly.

480
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,766
This is going to be great.

481
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,704
OK, cut, wonderful.

482
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,877
I'm very excited
about this project.

483
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,280
It's a much bigger than those
home videos I've been doing.

484
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,649
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Will you cast Rich?

485
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:00,353
Well, I can't
really say that now.

486
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:04,256
I have been looking at some
other actors with Carmichael.

487
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,925
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Regarding Carmichael, he's

488
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,660
Considered quite actor's
director, isn't he?

489
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,264
Yeah, yeah.

490
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,934
That's what they say.

491
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,871
Well, my other investors wanted
to bring him in, you see.

492
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,540
Hey, if it makes me money...

493
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,275
[Chuckles]

494
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,379
What I'd like you to do for
me is to tell me about one

495
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,281
Of the more horrifying
experiences of your life,

496
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,183
Or one of your past lives.

497
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,756
Um, but I memorized the lines.

498
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,557
That's OK.

499
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,091
We don't need that.

500
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,394
Just relax.

501
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,597
Think about that particular
moment in your life, and then

502
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,567
When you're ready, begin.

503
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,469
I was walking down
the street, and on

504
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,238
This is about eight months ago.

505
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,706
I was going over to
a friend's house,

506
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,642
And we were going to
get something to eat.

507
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,977
And then decide what to do.

508
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:03,883
So I was on the was to her pad,
and this dog, this huge pitbull

509
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,753
Was on the other
side of the fence,

510
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:14,060
And he had chased a poor
little kitten up a tree.

511
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,428
It was horrible.

512
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,296
I remember the dog
was just standing

513
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,665
There, laughing and laughing.

514
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,733
The dog caught the kitten?

515
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,101
That is horrible.

516
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,035
No.

517
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,837
The kitten was OK
up in the tree.

518
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,507
But it was horrible that
the owner of the dog

519
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,742
Could just stand
there and laugh.

520
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:33,446
Oh, at least the kitten was OK.

521
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:37,817
That is horrible
about the owner.

522
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,786
Atta girl.

523
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,721
Good.

524
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,189
Good girl.

525
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,793
So, you're OK.

526
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,228
I'm OK.

527
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,631
We're all OK.

528
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,000
That's touching now.

529
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,401
Now, could you please
take off your shirt.

530
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,675
Yeah, I'm really psyched
about my friend coming out.

531
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,211
We grew up together.

532
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,046
We were inseparable.

533
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,682
Man, we did everything together.

534
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,584
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: Rich is

Best friend, Duane
Brickton, shown

536
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,388
Here in my father's footage.

537
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:19,225
My father was eager to
film the two boys together,

538
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,193
Hoping that young
Duane's presence

539
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,529
Would help young Rich open up.

540
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,465
HAROLD ASAILIAN, SR.:
So, you're Duane, huh?

541
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,403
You two boys friends?

542
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:38,210
Do you go to school here?

543
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,378
Do you like school?

544
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,550
How come you don't like school?

545
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,559
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Duane is flying out

546
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,961
To LA to become a theater
and movie director

547
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,096
And to work with Rich.

548
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:00,600
Duane's really excited about
my progress here in Hollywood.

549
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,101
Eventually, Duane's
going to direct

550
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,402
Me in a Shakespeare play.

551
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,437
And then we'll want to do
the movie version together.

552
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,845
We first met around
kindergarten.

553
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,347
But we didn't
become best friends

554
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,384
Until first grade,
when we both got

Sent to the principal's office.

556
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,720
We got in trouble.

557
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,190
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: How
did you guys get in trouble?

558
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,796
Well you hit what
was her name, Sarah...

559
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,297
Baldwin.

560
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,799
Yeah, you hit Sarah
Baldwin in the stomach.

561
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,567
And I flipped off the teacher.

562
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,968
But I didn't really
flip her off.

563
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,338
I just raised my hand and she
thought I was flipping her off.

564
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,908
Yeah, that's true.

565
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,810
Hey, you got an H?

566
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,611
Yeah, I think.

567
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,913
You got a D?

568
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:47,714
Yeah, right here.

569
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,555
Anyway, we became best
friends and remained

570
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,090
That way through high school.

571
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,293
Actually we stayed friends
and were in the same school

573

574
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,298
Yeah, that's true.

575
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:15,341
This is a film I made at
Little River Community College.

576
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,142
And, are you ready?

577
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:16,943
Yeah.

That is so true, man.

So you want to be a director?

591
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:39,491
Well, yeah.

592
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,760
But I'm willing to
work up the ranks.

593
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,729
Yeah, well, I'm going
to get a job on the film.

You must be Duane.

598
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,306
Yeah.

599
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,308
How are you?

00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,845
Hello, Harold.

604
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,515
Yes, sir.

quite a filmmaker.

607

Well, I've got a lot
of learning to do.

608
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:11,590
I tell you what.

There may be an
opportunity for you

610

To learn what making movies is
all about on our next project.

611
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,500
If you're interested, I
might be able to work out

612
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,303
Some sort of apprenticeship.

613
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,438
That would be great.

614
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,475
Well, I wouldn't be able to
give you any remuneration right

615
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,877
Now, of course.

616
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:34,847
But you will gain an enormous
amount invaluable experience.

617
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,715
I mean that's what
I need right now.

618
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,518
This is going to look
really good on your resume.

For this project, your title
will be production assistant.

620

HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: So,
Duane, now that you're out here,

622
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,831

623
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:52,631

likes you very, very much.

decided that you go the part.

drawn up tomorrow.

Yeah.

655
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,502
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
As mentioned earlier,

656
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,871
The production values are
to be much higher than those

657
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:16,242
Of the amateur videos, and
as such, several top class

658
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,044
People in the industry
have been hired.

659
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,745
When I first got
into this business,

660
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,948
The biggest challenge
was the asses.

661
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,017
It was um, they were
still covered with zits.

662
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,418
There's an example of my work.

663
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,921
This is before.

664
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,256
And this is after.

665
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,892
And I swear there was no touch
ups to these photographs.

00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,694
This is the period
piece sequence

00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:39,198
Of the film where
Professor Aristotle

668
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,968
Has his famous dream sequence.

00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,803

supposed to be?

672
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,377
The 1700s or something.

673
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:54,313
This is Modigliani, right?

674
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,149
He's from the late 19th century.

675
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,418
So will that still be
appropriate for your set?

676
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,193
I mean, it's supposed
to be a dream, right?

677
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,795
I mean, who knows what
dreams actually mean, right?

678
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,564
Right.

679
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,066

Oh, no, no, it's fine.

00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,904
It's good.

682
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,840
Um, Alex, I'd like to
ask you a few questions

683
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,242
About cinematography.

684
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,478
As you well know, light is part
of the visible electromagnetic

685
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:27,679
Scale.

686
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,016
There also lights that
are part of the invisible

687
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,119
Electromagnetic spectrum,
such as infrared and

688
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,087
Ultraviolet light,
which I seldom use

689
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,455
Because no one can see them.

690
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:40,159
Now, in sculpting a scene, or
better yet painting a scene

691
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,761
To create a certain mood, I
make sure to always balance

692
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,332
Huygen's theory of light
reflection and refraction,

693
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,235
Which explains that light
in the 440 nanometer

694
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:53,439
Range to the 500 nanometer
range is perceived by us

695
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,675
As red, a color I would
tend to use when lighting

696
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,845
A scene, a hot, sensuous scene
between characters that have

697
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:03,482
Been previously established
as powerful sexual partners,

698
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,719
Sort of, we need to have each
other, although we are aware

699
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,121
Of the circumstances
type people.

700
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,291
But of course Planck's theory
of light as actual measurable

701
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:17,429
Particles or quanta, proves
that light is more of a wave

702
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,899
Particle phenomena than anything
else gives me the opportunity

703
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,101
To interchange these colors.

704
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,535
And very few people
would be able to tell

705
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,904
The difference consciously.

706
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,307
Uh, huh.

707
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:31,343
Of course, of all the people
on the set, the most important

708
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,345
Is the director.

709
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:36,548
Imagine where you were when
you were feeling that way.

710
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:48,927
If there are smells, fragrances,
odors, what are they?

711
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,367
Perhaps it's the
perspiration from a lover.

712
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,968
Or maybe there's
a hint of jasper.

713
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,971
What the hell's going on here?

714
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,740
How dare you?

715
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,975
Can't you see what's going on?

716
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,344
How much footage have you shot?

717
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,812
Don't change the subject.

718
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:07,713
Oh, how much footage...

719
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,548
We haven't shot anything yet.

720
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,649
Are you serious?

721
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,418
I've been rehearsing
the actors and taking

722
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,420
Them through exercises.

723
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,123
What... you mean to
tell me you have spent

724
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,190
The last five hours rehearsing?

725
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,058
You haven't given us
any rehearsal time,

726
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,227
So we're doing it now.

727
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,794
You don't need any
rehearsal time, Carmichael.

728
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,062
All these people
are getting paid.

729
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,536
I am feeling anger.

730
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,309
I am feeling hostility.

731
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,544
CARMICHAEL: The
first day of shooting

732
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:40,812
Is often a very
hideous experience.

733
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,981
Everybody's tense and nervous.

734
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,650
That's why I always
like to start out

735
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,385
Each movie with an easy scene.

736
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,987
First, Misty makes love
to you behind the bar.

737
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,722
Then you get up,
come over, and make

738
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,558
Love with Lucy on the chaise.

739
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,293
Then Misty gets up
from behind the bar,

740
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,295
Sees you, gets
jealous, comes over

741
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,763
And you make love with her.

742
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,232
Then they make love with
each other, which gets

743
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,234
You hot again, so you join in.

744
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,402
All right?
OK.

745
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,203
Good.

746
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,538
Action.

747
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,407
Young Aristotle.

748
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:09,808
Madame Monrovious.

749
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,310
What a surprise.

750
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,844
What are you doing?

751
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,713
I'm studying.

752
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,182
What are you doing here?

753
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,617
I have come to help you study.

754
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,586
How can that be?

755
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:24,089
Well, young Aristotle, though
you are a wise young guy,

756
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,794
There is still one philosophy
that you know nothing about.

757
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:29,861
This is true.

758
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,832
There is still one
thing you have to learn.

759
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:37,636
Although I am a genius,
I'm willing to learn.

760
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,339
Are you sure you're
ready to learn?

761
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,673
Yes, I am.

762
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,841
I'll take notes.

763
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,376
Oh, no, young Aristotle.

764
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,545
The first rule is
that you must relax.

765
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,395
Let me help.

766
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,596
HAROLD ASAILIAN,
JR.: I noticed Lucy

767
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:05,897
Had some problems
with your costume

768
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,399
During the dream sequence.

769
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,568
RICH: Yeah, but it was
exciting, because we

770
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,203
Improved the hell out of it.

771
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,405
Carmichael taught us
about improvisation

772
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,308
For when something goes
wrong during the scene,

773
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,009
You're supposed to
just keep going for it.

774
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,213
You just do it and you don't
worry about if something

775
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,249
Happens, you just go for it.

776
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,082
Yeah, it's cool.

777
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:24,883
Cut.

778
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:25,684
Wonderful.

779
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,287
[Clapping]

780
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,961
Rich, why don't
you take a break.

781
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,563
Duane, let's get one
of the stunt props up.

782
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,532
We have to shoot some close ups.

783
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,768
Stunt props, you're up.

784
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,504
You want to turn on a monitor.

785
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,439
Hi.

786
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,407
You're a stud.

787
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,875
All right.

788
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:50,709
My name's Shaunie.

789
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,077
This is Liz.

790
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,645
I'm Rich.

791
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,514
Rich, they need
you in wardrobe.

792
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,717
Do you have a girlfriend?

793
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,519
Hey, Duane, can I
talk to you for a sec?

794
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,653
Hey, no problem, sorry.

795
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:02,288
Hey, Duane, don't forget
to turn out the lights

796
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,355
When you're done.

797
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,656
No problem, man, I'll see you.

798
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:05,457
Hey, you betcha.

799
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,625
Hey, see you, Mike.

800
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:07,859
So what's up?

801
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,528
Do you think you can you
get a ride with [inaudible]?

802
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,497
I thought we were going to go
get some beers or something.

803
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:12,631
- Yeah.
- Take care guys.

804
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,732
- Night, Vince.
- See you.

805
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,301
Yeah, well, me and some
of the actors, we're

806
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:18,770
Gonna get a bite to eat and then
we're go to Carmichael's and do

807
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,071
Some rehearsing.

808
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,107
We're not getting as much
rehearsals on the sets, so...

809
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,409
Can I come?

810
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,010
Just to watch or something?

811
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,579
That would be cool to me, but
Carmichael just wants to keep

812
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,514
It actors only, you know.

813
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,315
Cool.

814
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,248
I understand.

815
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,450
You know, private thing.

816
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,584
No problem, don't
worry about it.

817
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,519
I gotta go, so.

818
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,620
OK I'll see you
back at the place.

819
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,421
Bye.

820
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:36,221
Be home about 11.

821
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,022
OK.

822
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,089
How about you?

823
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,391
Are you learning a lot?
Is it going well?

824
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,258
Oh, yeah.

825
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,327
Yeah, it's incredible.

826
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:45,697
I mean, Carmichael
is inspirational.

827
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,799
I mean, just, it's
like, it's like osmosis.

828
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:51,503
You know, being around
him, you learn so much.

829
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,440
I mean, the other day, the other
day, we went to a movie theater

830
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,442
To see one of his movies.

831
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,710
And I thought he went
there to see his work.

832
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:04,149
But we get there and he watches
the audience's reaction.

833
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,986
He watched the
audience's reaction.

834
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,721
[Sounds of sex from the screen]

835
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,495
Come on, come on,
everybody, let's go.

836
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:17,563
Time's a-wastin'.

837
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,864
Let's hurry up and
get this next shot.

838
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,165
Duane, where are you?

839
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,733
Duane, come on, we need this.
Get it.

840
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,801
Move it over here.
This over here.

841
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:23,769
I told you this before.

842
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,337
Get up off your ass.
Let's go.

843
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,372
You're the one.

844
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,773
I noticed on the set
the last few days,

845
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,508
You've seemed preoccupied.

846
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:33,011
Well, I don't think so.

847
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,046
I'm very relaxed.

848
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,383
I mean, look at me.

849
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:41,920
You can get any more relaxed
than this, now can you?

850
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,556
Listen, uh, you're going to
have to cut some of the scenes.

851
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,624
Cut?

852
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,292
Well, we're running
over budget already.

853
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,828
Now, distribution wants
this video in by the 5th.

854
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,363
I don't make a damn
cent on this thing

855
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,330
Unless it's in by the 5th.

856
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:53,432
I'm concerned about
the fog effect.

857
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,867
I told you we can't
afford the fog.

858
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,268
You promised me fog.

859
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:00,539
You're ruining the whole
elasticity of my movie.

860
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,242
It's absolutely necessary for
the 18th century European mood.

861
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,111
Like I said, we
can't afford it.

862
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:06,912
OK?

863
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,821
Good, go in there
like an animal, Bruno.

864
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,857
OK, everybody, and action.

865
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,597
Woo, hey man,
how'd you get here?

866
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,900
I'm young Aristotle and
I'm traveling through time.

867
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,969
Groovy.

868
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:31,770
Wo.

869
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,205
Groovy.

870
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,541
Where am I now?

871
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:40,412
You're in the middle of 1967,
baby, the summer of love.

872
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,347
1967.

873
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,951
Why has this period been
christened the summer of love?

874
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,855
Haven't you ever heard of
free love, young Aristotle?

875
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:53,892
I have no recollection
of that term.

876
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:58,196
Well, my wife and I will
show you and share with you

877
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,833

878
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,569
Share your wife?

879
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:07,205
Hey, we share everything
in the commune of love.

880
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,006
I guess that is groovy.

881
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:15,346
Hold it.

882
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:16,147
Hold it, hold it.

883
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,616
Everybody freeze.

884
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:21,386
OK, get that adjusted.

885
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:24,222
This is just the lights.

886
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:25,991
Where did you
say you were from?

887
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:26,792
Studio seven.

888
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,594
Hurry up, hurry.

889
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,328
So Rich, I've been wanting
to ask you something.

890
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,630
Sure.

891
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,032
You know, I've been on the
set and watching you shoot,

892
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,134
And I read the script.

893
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,236
And I'm just kind of wondering,
how does all this fit

894
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:42,273
Into your goals as an actor?

895
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,842
Fine.

896
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:44,810
What do you mean?

897
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,344
OK, well, let me
give you an example.

898
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,548
Here in the script, Breezy
says, we share everything

899
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:52,918
At the commune of love and
then young Aristotle says,

900
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,486
I guess that is groovy.

901
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,522
I mean, is that...
How does that... is

902
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:58,189
That challenging to
you as an artist?

903
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,825
It's experience.

904
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:03,695
You know, to go into the lines.

905
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,831
What do you know
about acting anyways?

906
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,098
Well I don't think...
I'm not claiming

907
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,133
I know anything about acting.

908
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:09,801
But I'm wondering... I know you.

909
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,070
I'm wondering how it
fits into your goals.

910
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,939
Have you ever acted before?

911
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,406
No, I haven't.

912
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,776
How do you know what's good for
me and what's not good for me?

913
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,044
I'm not saying I do.

914
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,746
I'm just... I want to know
how you feel about it,

915
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:21,813
What you're doing.

916
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,516
We've talked many
times about your goals.

917
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,518
Is this helping you get
to where you want to be?

918
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,318
Yeah.

919
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,157
All right.

920
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:35,193
I gotta go put my makeup on.

921
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:35,994
OK.

922
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,105
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: This
was a big day for Rich.

923
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,641
Well known co-star,
Lucy "Lace" Liebowitz

924
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,611
Brought him to the shooting of
a public service announcement,

925
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:53,845
Where Rich could
schmooze with some

926
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,214
Of the most illustrious
names in the business,

927
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,483
Such as Toby Barr
and Gemini Peeks.

928
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,485
I'd like you to meet Rich.

929
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:01,987
This is our new costar.

930
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,488
Bill.

931
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:04,455
Cody.

932
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,390
Gemini.

933
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,458
Hi, Rick.

934
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,259
Hi!

935
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:16,001
You just come in, and
then you deliver your line.

936
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,869
I had to lose my
virginity, right.

937
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,572
So I did. And then
I thought, but wait,

938
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:23,541
I want to have an orgasm,
so I accomplished that.

939
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:26,377
And then I though,
well, what's... multiple,

940
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,178
Multiple orgasms.

941
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,279
So I did.

942
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,214
Incredible.

943
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:30,949
Now I've got my family.

944
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,818
And it's so beautiful.

945
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,519
And there's never a dull moment.

946
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:46,231
He's always trying to bring
out my inner virtuosity.

947
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:47,198
And that's it.

948
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,900
The thing is, I
need to talk to you.

949
00:42:52,704 --> 00:43:09,387
The life four five
four three two

950
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,290
Hi, you may not recognize
us with our clothes on,

951
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,827
But you've probably seen us in
some of your favorite movies.

952
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,464
We represent ASS, the
Association of Safe Sex.

953
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,767
As you know, there's an
epidemic sweeping the world.

954
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:24,936
We're here to remind you that
safe sex is good practice.

955
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,238
I practice whenever I can.

956
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,475
Safe sex is the best
way to say I love you.

957
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,744
Practice safe sex.

958
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,913
Remember, practice
makes perfect.

959
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,653
[Knocking]

960
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,088
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: I was
hoping to meet with Rich,

961
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:46,524
So I could finally get his
perspective on the new shoot.

962
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,126
This was the second
time Rich had stood

963
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:52,664
Me up for an interview since our
misunderstanding over his work.

964
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,365
I was a little worried
about it and how

965
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,101
It would affect my film.

966
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,368
And I couldn't
help but think how

967
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,070
My father felt when
the younger Rich

968
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,338
Was too shy to talk to him.

969
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,078
My father thought of
himself as a failure

970
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,716
And I wasn't about to let
the film fall short now.

971
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,650
Professor Johnson?

972
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:15,186
Hi, it's Harold, calling
from Los Angeles.

973
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,254
How are you?

974
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,989
I decided to call
Professor Johnson back

975
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,425
At Perry College for
some advice regarding

976
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,527
Rich's evasive attitude.

977
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:25,630
He told me to be patient,
yet persistent, and most

978
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:28,967
Importantly, not to lose focus.

979
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,302
Rich, there you are.

980
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,204
Hey, Harold, what's up, man?

981
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:34,873
Are you ready
for the interview?

982
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:36,141
What interview?

983
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:39,110
1:30 on the nose, like we
talked about, remember?

984
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,047
Oh, uh, they're filming
a story about my life.

985
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,248
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

986
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,049
Cool, huh?

987
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:45,884
Oh, my god.

988
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:48,019
I'm like, a little
tired right now.

989
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,621
Do you think we could do it
some other time, like tomorrow?

990
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:51,823
I mean you promised.

991
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,425
The thing is that you've
already put me off before.

992
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,162
I really... I want to get you on
the set with this new project.

993
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:57,963
And...

994
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:58,764
Yeah, I know.

995
00:44:58,864 --> 00:44:59,731
It's just a good thing.

996
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,466
I'm really tired.

997
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:02,533
I've got an idea.

998
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,203
Why don't you go
interview the crew people,

999
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:09,540
You know, the little people
that make everything possible?

1000
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,178
I bet they'd love
to talk to you.

1001
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:13,979
OK.

1002
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,647
Thanks, man.

1003
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,083
Oh, shit.

1004
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,150
Pretty cool, huh?

1005
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,087
God, that's... oh, my
god, I had no idea.

1006
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,889
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

1007
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:24,689
Uh, huh.

1008
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,490
I bet.

1009
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:30,028
So where were we?

1010
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,764
I was asking you about your
job at the landscaping company.

1011
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,365
You know, I was wondering
how long you guys were

1012
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,834
Going to be doing your film?

1013
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,103
Um, another couple of weeks.

1014
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:40,505
Don't you have a girlfriend
to get back to or something?

1015
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,640
Back in Ohio or
wherever you're from?

1016
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,441
RICH: Hello.

1017
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,242
Hi.

1018
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,376
Where have you been?

1019
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,812
Sorry.

1020
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,013
Yeah great, sorry.

1021
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:50,215
Meanwhile, I'm stuck
having to entertain him.

1022
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:52,951
Look, I'm sorry I know you
don't want to hear this,

1023
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:55,020
But I gotta get back to the set.

1024
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,389
Carmichael is really working
us ragged, and overtime,

1025
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,625
So... brought some bread though.

1026
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,160
May be you and Harold
can feed the ducks?

1027
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:02,961
What?

1028
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:05,063
Harold, you want to...

1029
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:05,864
Shit.

1030
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:07,332
I can't believe you.

1031
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,200
Here, you take
the fucking bread.

1032
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,135
I said I'm sorry.

1033
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:11,102
What can I do?

1034
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,037
It's the business.

1035
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:13,939
I'll see you tonight.

1036
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,740
[Whispering]

1037
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,508
So what, you're actually
going to be able to perform

1038
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,476
Tonight or something?

1039
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,684
No, we've got nothing to hide.

1040
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,919
What do you think
about this, Harold?

1041
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:28,887
Can you believe this shit?

1042
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:29,888
Can I talk to you?

1043
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,156
Well, I think you
guys talk it out.

1044
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,424
No, I want to hear
what you have to say.

1045
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:43,869
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.

1046
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:44,669
OK?

1047
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:46,838
[Whispering]

1048
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,031
[Knocking]

1049
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:15,733
Betsy?

1050
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,635
Um, Look, I'm just
going to leave

1051
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,071
The bread over on the couch
here, over on the armrest?

1052
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:27,946
Listen, um, he's blown me off
for a bunch of interviews.

1053
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,316
So I know how you feel.

1054
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,684
You know, I think
he's just tired.

1055
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,155
You know, I agree with
you, that's no excuse.

1056
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,656
Of course, I'd be
tired too, with all

1057
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,258
The female fans
coming around the set

1058
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,628
And all the sex and everything.

1059
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:47,298
I was just kidding about that,
the female fans and the sex.

1060
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:48,967
What I'm saying is, I
don't think he's screwing

1061
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:52,037
Around or anything like that.

1062
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:53,671
You want to come on
out and talk about it?

1063
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,974
No.

1064
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,675
OK.

1065
00:47:57,775 --> 00:47:59,444
Could you just leave, please?

1066
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:00,845
Sure.

1067
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,648
OK, look, I'm going to leave the
bread over there on the couch.

1068
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:04,449
OK?

1069
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:13,491
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: With Rich
busy at private rehearsals,

1070
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:15,660
Duane wanted to introduce
me to a new self awareness

1071
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,329
Group he'd recently discovered.

1072
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,365
I was anxious to get
more footage of Rich,

1073
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,633
But I felt sorry for
Duane, and I decided

1074
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,569
To tag along with him,
hoping I could get

1075
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,037
Out there as soon as possible.

1076
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:26,804
Duane.

1077
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,174
How are you?

1078
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,108
It' good to see you.

1079
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,342
Good seeing you.

1080
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:32,643
Remember I was telling
you about this documentary?

1081
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,444
Yes.

1082
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:34,579
Yes, they're here.

1083
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:35,480
Yeah, this is Harold.

1084
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,747
This is Wolf.
Hi, Wolf.

1085
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:37,548
Nice to meet you.

1086
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,651
Gee, this is neat.

1087
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,887
Sorry, you can't film today.

1088
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:44,922
I'd love to, it's just that
I didn't tell the group.

1089
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:45,856
And you understand.

1090
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,292
I completely understand.

1091
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:48,126
Relax over it.

1092
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,460
We won't get upset.

1093
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,761
I'll mention it at the meeting.

1094
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,929
And we'll film another time.

1095
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,730
OK.

1096
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,332
OK, Duane, Harold.

1097
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,734
But I'd love to tell you
about Growl, if I could.

1098
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,536
I told Duane and he's here.

1099
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,638
Wonderful, it's wonderful.

1100
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,373
It's... let me say hello
to an old Growler.

1101
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:05,176
How are you?

1102
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,013
Grr.

1103
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:13,184
Growl helps you realize where
you should be in life, not

1104
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:17,088
Where you were coded to be, or
your family said you should be,

1105
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,390
Or where you think
you should be.

1106
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,959
But where you really should be.

1107
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:29,800
DUANE: The meeting was amazing.

1108
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,238
I learned so much
about myself, about why

1109
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,806
I do the certain things I do.

1110
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,476
It's got to help
me as a director.

1111
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,544
Rich.

1112
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:40,378
I think Rich would it.

1113
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,280
I gotta tell him all about it.

1114
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,248
Sorry.

1115
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:44,382
RICH: Yeah, I've done a few.

1116
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,121
Oh, God, Rich.

1117
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,089
You're wonderful.

1118
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:56,761
Asshole.

1119
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,669
What's going on?

1120
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,671
What are you doing?

1121
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,639
Hey, what's going on?

1122
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,608
You're not leaving, are you?

1123
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,510
Hey, wait, come back.

1124
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,612
Hey, let's talk about this.

1125
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,047
So, what's her name?

1126
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:17,448
Her name?

1127
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:18,683
What are you talking about?

1128
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:22,053
[Door slams]

1129
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,054
What did you tell her?

1130
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:23,854
What?

1131
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:24,822
You told her, didn't you?

1132
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,023
Why would I tell
her anything, man?

1133
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,125
You're jealous.

1134
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,059
What?

1135
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,527
I get all the chicks I want.

1136
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:32,263
You couldn't get
laid if you tried.

1137
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,064
Hey.

1138
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,542
Her car's here.

1139
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,277
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: You've
already said that, Rich.

1140
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,617
I was little sorry for
Rich's predicament,

1141
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,385
And I felt it was
very important for him

1142
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,787
To patch things up with Betsy.

1143
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,956
Furthermore, I felt it
make for great scene

1144
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,291
To capture the drama on film.

1145
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:16,941
Let's go.

1146
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,144
Where you going?

1147
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,511
I know.

1148
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:21,912
This is the perfect... you been
trying to reach her all day.

1149
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,681
Here she is.

1150
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,317
Betsy... she doesn't
like the camera, OK?

1151
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,086
Come on, she never
reminded before.

1152
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,321
Come on, let's go.

1153
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,522
Are you nervous?

1154
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:32,323
No.

1155
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:36,761
What's the deal?

1156
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:40,198
I thought you were
going to go in there.

1157
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,699
I've got some things
I've got to do tonight.

1158
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:42,900
I'm busy.

1159
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,735
I've got to watch Michael
Caine's acting video.

1160
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:45,536
Oh, come on.

1161
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,472
You're making excuses.

1162
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:48,539
Look you want to talk to her.

1163
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,340
She's in there.

1164
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,175
Go knock on the door.

1165
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:50,975
What is it?

1166
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,377
Come on.

1167
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:53,778
What's your rush?

1168
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:54,979
Let's just go.

1169
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,683
Look, the truth is, you've
been blowing me off, OK?

1170
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:02,019
I called my professor and he
told me to show, not tell,

1171
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,021
Show the drama, don't tell it.

1172
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,923
So there's, there's
a drama in there.

1173
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:07,692
Go knock on the door
and show me the drama.

1174
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,527
Let's just go, OK?

1175
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,396
Let's go.

1176
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:12,197
Please?

1177
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:18,969
Unlock the door, please.

1178
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:29,914
[Soft growling sounds]

1179
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:32,417
What's going on?

1180
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,889
What the hell's going on?

1181
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,891
It's Growling, man.

1182
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,362
Look, everybody keep
going, keep growling.

1183
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,863
Look, I thought you
were rehearsing, man.

1184
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:46,864
We'll be done in an hour.

1185
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:47,898
No, man.

1186
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,133
I'm supposed to
watch Michael Caine's

1187
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,601
Acting technique on the video.

1188
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,870
And I'm tired and I
want to watch it now.

1189
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,104
Why don't you join us?

1190
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:54,905
Relax with us.

1191
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,906
It's wonderful.

1192
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,375
It's wonderful.

1193
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,945
It'll help you find
where we want to be.

1194
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,648
Who the hell... who
the hell is this?

1195
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,115
Look, look, I'm
sorry about this.

1196
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,584
I'm really sorry about this, OK?

1197
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,652
We'll be done in an hour.

1198
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,220
Why don't you just
go to your room and...

1199
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,020
No, no.

1200
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,821
Fuck that.

1201
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,956
I'm not going into my room.

1202
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,558
This is my apartment.
I live here.

1203
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:14,792
I'm letting you live here.

1204

going to watch my video now.

you guys to wake up now, huh?

1206

Well, it's time to leave.

What, don't they
understand English?

What the hell is the
matter with you, man?

00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:29,106
You wouldn't help
me with my lines,

But you got time for this shit.

1211
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,042
That makes a lot of sense.

1212
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,779
Look, I'm really sorry that
my roommate here's an asshole.

1213

So Lucy said this might

1226

Be your last file for a while.

1227
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:15,820
Is that true?

1228
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,654
Yeah.

1229
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,055
How come?

1230
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,490
I'm going to have a baby.

1231
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,658

- Yeah.

00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:22,860
Yeah.

This time I'm going to keep it.

1235
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,232
Her name will be Eleanor.

1236
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,100
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Really pretty name.

1237
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,936
You already know
it's a girl then.

1238
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,170
Well, not yet.

1239
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,539
But I have a feeling.

1240
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:35,906
But I love the name Eleanor.

1241
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,575
I used to have a little
puppy by that name.

1242
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:39,109
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Really what kind was it?

1243
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:39,910
I don't know.

1244
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,045
It was one from the pound.

1245
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:42,580
So, which one of these
guys got you pregnant?

1246
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:46,216
What?

1247
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:48,886
Which one of the studs
is gonna be a dad?

1248
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,356
Oh shut up, you asshole.

1249
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,023
What I do on the set is work.

1250
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,695
This child is a result of love.

1251
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,665
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
Don't worry about him.

1252
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:03,634
Hey, Max, you don't know where
the hell Duane is, do you?

1253
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:04,502
Uh, no.

1254
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:06,404
He hasn't show up yet.

1255
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,272
All right, well, when he
gets in, tell him to call me.

1256
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,408
I got some things I need
him to pick up, all right.

1257
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:11,909
You don't know
where he is, do you?

1258
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:12,877
No.

1259
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:13,678
Damn it.

1260
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:22,119
[Pin ball sounds]

1261
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,425
You know, I was looking over
some of my father's old footage

1262
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,660
Today.

1263
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,396
I couldn't help thinking
about you and Duane,

1264
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,898
And how it must feel now
that you have had a fight.

1265
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,133
We didn't fight.

1266
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:36,934
He moved out.

1267
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:37,835
You don't know where he is.

1268
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,169
So?

1269
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,571
He's your best friend.

1270
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,140
It would be good to talk to
him about Betsy. Or something.

1271
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,074
I just learned something.

1272
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,510
You've got to look
for number one.

1273
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,744
I don't need Betsy.

1274
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:47,812
I don't need Duane.

1275
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,647
All I got to do is
worry about Carmichael's

1276
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:54,218
Acting technique and my acting
career and I'll be fine.

1277
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,554
Duane!

1278
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:59,256
A couple days later I
received a message from Duane,

1279
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,125
Saying where I could find him.

1280
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,293
We'd planned to
meet, but I was late.

1281
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,463
I caught him just in time.

1282
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,097
How the heck have you been?

1283
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,265
Where were you?

1284
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,900
I was trying to track
you down, you know?

1285
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,768
Yeah, I know.

1286
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,970
It's... [inaudible].

1287
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,672
Yeah.

1288
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,607
Hey, look at this.

1289
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,243
Look at that.

1290
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:22,212
Shakespeare for seniors.

1291
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:23,113
What is it?

1292
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:23,981
It's a program.

1293
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,349
I'm directing it.

1294
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,717
It's like a thing
where we do Shakespeare

1295
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:27,918
For senior citizens.

1296
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:30,254
And you know, I'm doing Hamlet.

1297
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:31,789
Hamlet, huh?

1298
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:32,590
All right.

1299
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,763
Can I do it now?

1300
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:39,564
What?

1301
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:40,831
Can I tell him who I am?

1302
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:41,766
Oh, sure, go ahead.

1303
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,033
Thanks.

1304
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,671
Hi, I'm Rosie Mitchell, of
Rosie's Catering Service.

1305
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,839
I specialize in film shoots.

1306
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,975
And as you see, we have
a variety of specialties.

1307
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:55,480
Today our specialty is
tortellini trevigiana.

1308
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,781
Thanks.

1309
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:59,650
Sure, my pleasure.

1310
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,652
Good.

1311
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,153
Yummy.

1312
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,189
I mean, I'm so think
of these cheap bastards.

1313
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:08,793
I don't give senior citizen
discounts, you know?

1314
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:13,097
You should have heard the
proposition I got last night.

1315
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,833
How come you're not
shooting right now?

1316
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:16,967
They're still setting up.

1317
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,103
Are you serious?

1318
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:20,605
What the hell's going on here?

1319
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:25,843
What the... what is this?

1320
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:29,446
I thought I told you... my god!

1321
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:30,948
Who rented this fog?

1322
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,650
I rented it.

1323
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,384
I told you we
couldn't afford it.

1324
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:37,354
And I told you it's
essential for this scene.

1325
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,056
Oh, that's nice, Carmichael.
That's real nice.

1326
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,157
Now who's going to pay for this?

1327
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,458
That's not my concern.

1328
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,828
It's my job to make
the best film possible.

1329
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:45,395
Oh, well, you're sure
as hell right there.

1330
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:48,766
It's not your concern.

1331
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:51,101
Just get out.

1332
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,537
Yeah, that's right, get out.

1333
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:56,073
You're not directing
this film anymore.

1334
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:56,874
Out?

1335
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:04,081
This film isn't going to have
any more artistic integrity.

1336
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,087
Oh, is that right?

1337
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:11,488
Well, what are you
standing there for?

1338
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:12,990
Get in your places, positions.

1339
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,291
We'll shoot the scene.

1340
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:15,993
Come on.

1341
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:19,864
[Loud moaning]

1342
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:21,799
Oh, yes!

1343
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:22,600
Cut.

1344
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,203
Roll that one back for me.

1345
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:30,575
That's good.

1346
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,848
What the hell is this?

1347
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:41,085
Alice, get your ass over
here and explain this to me.

1348
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,953
You missed the ejaculation shot.

1349
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:45,289
Well, what the hell you
doing on his face, Alice?

1350
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:47,224
You missed a perfectly
good money shot.

1351
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:48,993
You told me to shoot
the facial expressions.

1352
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,360
Shit.

1353
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,461
Do I still get my bonus?

1354
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,433
You got to remember
that things like

1355
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,637
That happen in this business.

1356
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:02,539
I don't deny that
Carmichael is an artist.

1357
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,209
But he has to remember
that I'm his employer.

1358
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,878
We have a responsibility
to our investors.

1359
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:09,079
HAROLD ASAILIAN,
JR.: So do you feel

1360
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:12,617
Confident that you can direct?

1361
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,952
Yeah.

1362
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,488
I been in this
business a long time.

1363
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,090
What kid of comment is that?

1364
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,827
Look, Rich, what
I want you to do

1365
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,730
Is I want you to look at her
breasts when you say that line.

1366
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:26,697
Really?

1367
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,198
Yeah.

1368
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,267
That's not what
Michael Caine said.

1369
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,002
Michael what?

1370
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,237
He said, pick an eye.

1371
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,639
What are you talking about?

1372
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,741
Well, Michael
Caine's acting video,

1373
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:38,575
He says, pick eye
of the other actor

1374
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,611
And concentrate only on that.

1375
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:43,480
And that makes your
performance more believable.

1376
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,518
Also, if you pick just one eye,
not both of them, just one eye,

1377
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:52,857
The you're more focused and you
don't seem shifty and nervous.

1378
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:53,691
Look,

1379
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,092
I don't give a shit about that.

1380
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:57,628
You are horny, and I want you
to look at her tits, all right?

1381
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:58,428
Jesus.

1382
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:06,036
Maybe you should just pick one
and then your eyes won't shift.

1383
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:08,739
What a shitty director.

1384
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:11,141
Yeah.

1385
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:11,942
Why don't you direct?

1386
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,513
No, thanks.

1387
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,282
Look, I just don't need
him in here anymore.

1388
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,483
Just get him out of here.

1389
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,118
All right, but Alice said
that he could be here.

1390
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,687
Alice said.
I don't care what Alice said.

1391
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:24,554
I don't want him and
I can't afford him.

1392
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:25,890
Just get him out of here.
Excuse me.

1393
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,691
Trouble.

1394
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,358
I don't care.

1395
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,593
Could I talk to
you for a minute?

1396
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:31,929
Yeah, you take care of that
for me, Mike, all right?

1397
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:32,730
OK.

1398
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,398
OK, what's up?

1399
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:37,367
I want to talk to
you about Carmichael.

1400
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,837
OK.

1401
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,371
Me and the other
actors were talking

1402
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:46,110
And we think you should
hire Carmichael back.

1403
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:46,911
You do?

1404
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,215
Yeah, it would be
really important to us

1405
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,284
Because he's like the best
director we've ever worked for.

1406
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,419
So...

1407
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:57,755
Oh, you think that would
be good for the actors?

1408
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,857
Yeah.

1409
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,325
You think that would
help the performances?

1410
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,593
Get some chemistry in there?

1411
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:08,498
Right, you know, it's
like well, he helps us-

1412
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,300
Find your motivation?

1413
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,568
Yeah.

1414
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:17,241
That's good, I mean,
It's important to us.

1415
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,809
Well, that's something
to think about.

1416
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,277
That's all I can do, is ask.

1417
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:21,912
Can I ask you
just one question?

1418
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,452
Who the fuck do you
think you are, Rich?

1419
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,358
[Sigh] I don't fucking
care what you think.

1420
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,093
I don't give a shit
what you think.

1421
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,361
I don't pay you to think.

1422
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,630
I pay you to fuck.

1423
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,133
Jesus.

1424
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,635
What the fuck you got
riding on this shit anyway?

1425
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:46,603
Nothing.

1426
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,372
That's what you
got, nothing, Rich.

1427
01:01:48,472 --> 01:01:49,173
No.

1428
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:50,474
You know what you got?

1429
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,609
All you got is right down there.

1430
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:57,547
And that's all I need from you,
know what you've got, Rich.

1431
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,648
And know your place.

1432
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:10,160
Hey, Rich, Rich, come on, man.

1433
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,196
Look, he didn't
mean any of that.

1434
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:14,198
He's just stressed out.

1435
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:17,301
All he thinks of me is a cock.

1436
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,435
He's like a father
figure to you.

1437
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:20,604
You said it yourself.

1438
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,439
Doesn't he know I'm an actor?

1439
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:23,207
Yes, he does.

1440
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:27,011
Things just got out of hand.

1441
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,578
I'm just a cock to him.

1442
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,923
I'm want to talk to Betsy.

1443
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:40,190
I think that's a
really good idea.

1444
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,225
There's a phone right up there.

1445
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:42,226
Why don't you give her a call?

1446
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,531
I'm going to talk
to her in person.

1447
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:48,665
This time she'll
know I'm serious.

1448
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:10,054
[Knocking]

1449
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,527
Hi, what are you doing?

1450
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,030
What are you doing here?

1451
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,267
I thought I'd... I
want to talk to you.

1452
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:26,536
Haven't you ever
heard of a phone?

1453
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,873
Yeah.

1454
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:29,974
What's going on?

1455
01:03:30,074 --> 01:03:31,508
It's OK.

1456
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,210
Just go back and
watch the game, honey.

1457
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,880
I'll be in in a minute.

1458
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:36,680
OK.

1459
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:46,356
Hey, look, um, I wanted
to tell you that I'm

1460
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,592
Sorry about the affair.

1461
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:52,062
She didn't mean anything.

1462
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,063
So you did have one?

1463
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,534
I was bluffing.

1464
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,542
Look, um, take care.

1465
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:41,778
Come on, man.

1466
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:42,712
Let's go play some foosball.

1467
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:43,914
Let's get your mind off it.

1468
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,015
Let's go have some fun.

1469
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:55,225
It is cheaper here.

1470
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,864
Doing all right?

1471
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:02,132
- I'm doing OK.
- Good.

1472
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,367
It's going to be all right, man.

1473
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:06,937
It's going to be all right.

1474
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:10,607
You know, life is,
well, it's life.

1475
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,477
I mean, you've got to not
be afraid to experience it,

1476
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,844
You know?

1477
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:18,215
I just think you're doing a
damn, hell of a good job, man.

1478
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,430
[Knocking]

1479
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,565
Excuse me.

1480
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:39,769
Lady, your pizza's here.

1481
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,572
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: Obviously,
Rich was very depressed.

1482
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,175
I tried to cheer him up by
watching some of his videos

1483
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,544
And showing interest
in his work.

1484
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,413
But looking back, I should
have realized that he

1485
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:50,947
Didn't want to talk about that.

1486
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:53,217
What happened to Dr. Zhivago?

1487
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:56,153
I haven't seen this
one, so I popped it in.

1488
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,254
You haven't seen this one?

1489
01:05:57,354 --> 01:05:58,588
Huh, uh.

1490
01:05:58,688 --> 01:05:59,889
Actually Lucie
told me about it,

1491
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,426
But you never showed it
to me, so I saw the label

1492
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:03,627
And popped it in.

1493
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,095
The ones I haven't seen.

1494
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:07,864
We don't want to
watch Dr. Zhivago?

1495
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,200
Yeah, sure, later.

1496
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,169
You know, it's
interesting to see this

1497
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:15,505
Because now that you're
working on a feature,

1498
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,841
It's really
interesting to see sort

1499
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:19,676
Of the evolution of where
you've come from there

1500
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:23,647
To here with real budget stuff.

1501
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,050
This is the first time you
worked with Lucie, right?

1502
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,955
Must have been kind of
exciting to know she was a star

1503
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:32,989
And you were just starting out.

1504
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:41,398
Let me ask you something.

1505
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,899
Was she pretty good?

1506
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:48,838
Yeah, great.

1507
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,940
You know, you're
good here, but I

1508
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,476
Can definitely see
where you've taken

1509
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,710
Your craft to another level.

1510
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:08,558
This is the best time I've
ever had delivering pizza, lady.

1511
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,227
Look, man, let's
call it a night.

1512
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:11,027
What?

1513
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:12,196
Sure?

1514
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:13,297
Yeah.

1515
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,498
I kind of wanted to
catch the rest of it.

1516
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:15,965
I'm tired.

1517
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,967
What about Dr. Zhivago?

1518
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:21,438
Let's do it some other time.

1519
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,606
Really?

1520
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,407
I'm tired.

1521
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,620
And then what
happened in your dream?

1522
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,390
You unbuttoned my pants
and pulled them down.

1523
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,172
LEE: Come on, Rich, come on.

1524
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:01,645
OK, cut.

1525
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:02,479
Cut.

1526
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,880
Don't waste any more footage.

1527
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,191
What's the deal here, Rich?

1528
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,526
I'm sorry.

1529
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:21,030
Look, you know I'm behind
on this damn thing already.

1530
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:22,732
You're obviously
having a problem again.

1531
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:26,803
All right.

1532
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:28,472
Quiet on the set.

1533
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:29,806
Get ready.

1534
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:33,143
Just get ready to roll the
camera whenever Rich is ready.

1535
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:47,123
Come on, Rich, we go
the shot, come on.

1536
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:49,058
Come on, girl, come on.

1537
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:51,295
Ah, Jesus, Rich.

1538
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:52,095
Damn it.

1539
01:08:52,196 --> 01:08:53,163
All right.

1540
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:53,963
Take five.

1541
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:54,764
Take five, everybody.

1542
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:12,482
Roll camera.

1543
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:13,317
Speed.

1544
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:15,118
Scene 12, take 2.

1545
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:20,156
OK, act.

1546
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,099
And then what
happened in your dream?

1547
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,937
You unbuttoned my pants
and took them off.

1548
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:48,852
That's it.

1549
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,292
[Heavy breathing and moaning]

1550
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:13,176
Yeah, that's it.

1551
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:14,177
Oh, yeah.

1552
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:17,681
Here it comes.

1553
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,149
It's getting bigger.

1554
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,651
Here you come.

1555
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:24,654
Oh, it's so hard now.

1556
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:27,724
I love the way you taste.

1557
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:32,562
Mm/ Such a big piece of meat.

1558
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,901
Oh, God, you are such a stud.

1559
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:43,273
I quit.

1560
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,512
Where the hell
you going, asshole?

1561
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:51,147
Get your fucking
ass back in here!

1562
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,717
You son of a bitch!

1563
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:56,453
Fuck you, son of a bitch!

1564
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:57,253
God damn it!

1565
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:05,829
Turn that camera
off, God damn it.

1566
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,263
Jesus Christ!

1567
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:09,299
Fuck!

1568
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,269
I told you to turn
that fucker off!

1569
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,439
Shit!

1570
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:16,239
God damn it!

1571
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:22,612
Asshole!

1572
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,257
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: Rich
locked himself in his apartment

1573
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:35,992
For the next few days.

1574
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:39,262
He wouldn't let the camera in.

1575
01:11:39,363 --> 01:11:41,998
I decided to bring over the
Shakespeare for Senior flyer

1576
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:46,436
That Duane had given me,
along with some groceries.

1577
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:49,272
Rich said, quote,
"There's no way in hell"

1578
01:11:49,373 --> 01:11:51,274
I'd even do Duane's play.

1579
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,310
"In fact, I'm quitting
acting forever."

1580
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,413
Unquote.

1581
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:58,314
[Church bell rings]

1582
01:11:58,415 --> 01:12:00,384
When audition time
rolled around,

1583
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:03,653
Rich called to tell me that
maybe he'd be trying out.

1584
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:06,089
Just in case, I decided
to have my camera

1585
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,458
Ready at the audition
site, held at St.

1586
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,626
Andrew's Lutheran church.

1587
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:13,830
Name?

1588
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,799
Rich Longfellow.

1589
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,967
Is that with one L or two?

1590
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:18,768
Two.

1591
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:19,769
Thanks a lot for coming in.

1592
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:20,837
Really great to meet you.

1593
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:22,406
Yeah, I really liked
what you did there.

1594
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:23,206
Thanks.

1595
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:32,616
What are you doing here?

1596
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:35,084
I'm here to audition.

1597
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,053
There's no pay.

1598
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:38,021
It's Shakespeare.

1599
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,706
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.:
How did the audition go?

1600
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:59,809
RICH: It was a little
nerve wracking at first.

1601
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:02,812
But then I just tried to
focus in on the character.

1602
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,548
Duane helped me a lot too.

1603
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:07,584
He talked about
Hamlet's motivation.

1604
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:10,887
And he just really
coached me really good.

1605
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:14,290
I think I gave a
pretty good reading.

1606
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,594
You know, I'm very lucky to
have a friend like Duane.

1607
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:20,396
Thanks a lot.

1608
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:21,798
Uh, who's next?

1609
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:22,766
Rich Longfellow.

1610
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:23,567
Rich.

1611
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:24,768
How you doing?

1612
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:25,569
Great.

1613
01:13:32,676 --> 01:13:34,511
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: Rich
landed the lead in Hamlet

1614
01:13:34,611 --> 01:13:36,880
And the company was soon
touring the senior citizen

1615
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,016
Recreation centers of the
Greater San Fernando Valley.

1616
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,218
This is it.

1617
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:44,287
I just want to I tell
you, I know we've worked

1618
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:47,256
Long and hard on this show.

1619
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,992
And I think it's been worth it.

1620
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,227
I think we've got to
come together now,

1621
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:53,329
And I've done all that I can do.

1622
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,230
I mean, it's your show now.

1623
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,031
It's your baby.

1624
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:58,267
It's ours.

1625
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,904
We've earned it.

1626
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:05,408
Let's just go out there and
let's just do everyone proud.

1627
01:14:05,509 --> 01:14:07,343
Have a good time with it.

1628
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,312
[Clapping]

1629
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:20,189
How smart the lash that
speech doth give my conscience.

1630
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,960
The harlot's cheek, beautied
with plastering art.

1631
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,763
Is not more ugly to
the thing that helps it

1632
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:31,234
Than is my deed to
my most painted word.

1633
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:32,301
Oh, heavy burden.

1634
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,806
I hear him coming.

1635
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:38,041
Let's withdraw, my lord.

1636
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:54,758
To be, or not to be.

1637
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:57,861
That is the question.

1638
01:14:57,961 --> 01:15:01,965
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows

1639
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:05,268
Of outrageous
fortune, or to take

1640
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:11,575
Arms against a sea of trouble,
and by opposing, end them.

1641
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:16,112
To die, to sleep no more.

1642
01:15:16,212 --> 01:15:20,449
And by a sleep, we say
to end the heartache

1643
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:26,089
And the thousand natural
shocks that flesh is heir to.

1644
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,424
'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished...

1645
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,660
HAROLD ASAILIAN, JR.: As
Rich realizes his dream,

1646
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,096
I hope I helped my father
realize his own dream

1647
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:35,599
By completing this film.

1648
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:38,835
Wherever he is, if he can
somehow see his finished

1649
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:42,205
Product, I hope he's pleased.

1650
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:44,974
In any case, I dedicate
this with love,

1651
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:48,745
To the visionary behind
it all, my father,

1652
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:52,849
Dr. Harold Asailian, Sr.

1653
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:54,350
[Applause]

1654
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:03,392
