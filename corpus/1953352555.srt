I'm not saying shit
till you turn the damn thing on.

5
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,370
So, um, what's your name?

6
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:41,848
King.

7
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:46,412
King.

8
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:49,041
- How'd you get that name?
- It's always been.

9
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:52,125
Is that your real name
or your street name or...?

10
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:54,125
- Just my name.
- So how was--?

11
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:57,092
- Can I have a smoke?
- Sure.

12
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,526
Thanks.

13
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:06,051
- So how was jail?
- Oh, fuck.

14
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,169
- Can I--? Can I say "fuck"?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,613
It says here, "assault,
possession, loitering."

16
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,766
- That's pretty petty stuff.
- Yeah, right.

17
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:19,685
It's just survival.

18
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,449
A lot of kids tell you that they party
all night with Axl Rose,

19
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,173
or that their girlfriend
just got banged by the Crips,

20
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,722
or they've seen five guys
get murdered or something,

21
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:31,453
but the truth is, it's not hard.

22
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,445
It's not easy.

23
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:36,651
It just is.

24
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:40,606
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:42,685
How long have you been
on the street?

26
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,924
Six or seven years.

27
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,925
How old are you?

28
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,486
Uh, 20, might be 21 .
I'm not exactly sure.

29
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,009
That's a good question, though.

30
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,370
Did you have any brothers
or sisters growing up?

31
00:01:56,534 --> 00:02:00,891
Yeah, I got a sister,
but, uh, she's gone
from home too.

32
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,973
Maybe she'll show up here
in Hollywood sometime, you know.

33
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:06,442
I'll take care of her
or something.

34
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,325
I hope she's not into drugs
or anything. She probably is.

35
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:12,768
Might be dead.

36

What about your mom,
your dad?

37
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:16,127
- What about them?
- Do you, um--?

38
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:18,046
Not very comfortable
talking about them.

39
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,488
Yeah.

participation in this program

00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:17,652
A little something about your day?
A little titbit?

171
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:21,015
A little titbit about you.
About your day.

172
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:24,456
Well, I'm just--

173
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,370
I'm looking to get out of here
and hook up.

174
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,533
You all right?
Yeah.

175
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,893
Don't be a puss.
Fuck you.

176
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,413
Okay, man. You gonna crash
with us in the hole tonight?

177
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,569
We saved your clothes and shit.

178
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,617
KING: No, I was gonna look
for Devon, maybe get some.

179
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,246
Has anybody seen her?
No, man, I ain't seen her.

180
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:47,886
What do you mean?
I mean, I ain't seen her, man.

181
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,812
Well, what in the fuck,
you guys?! Goddamn!

182
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,696
I told you to watch out
for my lady.

183
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,611
And-- So, what, is that
too much to ask, or what?

184
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:59,612
All right, look, King, man,
last time we seen her,
she was with that kid, Tommy Ray.

185
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,292
I think she's in his stable.

186
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,130
You've seen Devon
with Tommy Ray?

187
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,018
Yeah, she started swinging with him
when you got locked up.

188
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,568
Just out of curiosity,
were you gonna tell me?

189
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,695
Yeah.
Yeah? When?

190
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,132
I don't know.

191
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:14,334
Thank God you're back.
Hey, Brenda.

192
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:16,534
Who are you?
Heather.

193
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,450
KING: You just get here?
Two days ago.

194
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,735
BRENDA: She's from Chicago.
Trip out. Me too.

195
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,570
Bullshit, you're from Phoenix.

196
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:27,176
Brenda, you know, the next time
I want you to open your mouth,
I'll point at you.

197
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,735
Why don't you sit down.
You're making me nervous.

198
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,378
I'm King.

199
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,893
King? As in what,
Burger?

200
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,447
He's the one I told you about.
Yeah, I bet you did.

201
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,373
Hey, y'all, I was thinking
of maybe going and doing
a little train hopping.

202
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,369
Yeah.
How'd that be?

203
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,612
Cool.
Greg's got some speed, don't you?

204
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,567
I was thinking maybe we'd get
some pot and some mushrooms.

205
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:57,129
Let's get all fucked up.
Yeah, later. Hey, Crasher, come here.

206
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:58,777
Come here, man.

207
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,409
INTERVIEWER: So why do you think
so many kids come out here?

208
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,810
KING: Most kids come out to L.A.
looking for Hollywood.

209
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,571
BRENDA: Told you everything
would be cool, didn't I?

210
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,218
Usually, it's not what they expect.

211
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:11,097
You're from Chicago?
Yeah.

212
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:16,290
Crasher, I went in lockup
for two months, I get out,
and everything turns to shit.

213
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,609
I took a zip gun off
of Little J tonight.

214
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:21,733
And Greg is off,
tweaking his brains out.

215
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,288
And where the hell is my girlfriend?

216
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,177
I don't know.
Huh?

217
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,694
I don't know.

218
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,695
Well, what the fuck
do you know about?

219
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,489
Well, don't look at me
like it's my fault.

220
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,254
Crasher, man, you fucked me.

221
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,570
I asked you to look out
for everyone.

222
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,616
Well, you shouldn't
have done that.

223
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,895
That was a mistake.

224
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,896
I mean, shit, man,
nobody listens to me.

225
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,778
You're the only one
they listen to.

226
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,134
Shit, I'm older than you,
and I don't get that kind of respect.

227
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,177
Before you start pointing fingers,
you take a look in that fucking mirror.

228
00:14:58,339 --> 00:14:59,931
That's the guy
you wanna blame.

229
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,250
You know, it's pretty lame
how you got busted that way.

230
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:04,938
You know, and then you
just, like, disappear

231
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:07,090
and figure, well, I'm just gonna,
like, keep tabs on everybody?

232
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,658
Well, guess again, pal.

233
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,129
On Devon?

234
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,651
Yeah.

235
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,449
I'm sorry, man...

236
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,691
but it's not my fault.

237
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:24,812
I didn't have anyone else
I could ask.

238
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,736
What are you doing?
You stink.

239
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,492
That's you, man.
It's not me.

240
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,810
It's you.
It's not me.

241
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,218
Someone could be dying
in the fucking streets,
and they won't do a thing.

242
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,450
But if you just so happen
to jaywalk,

243
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,133
10 of them will come out
of the woodwork.

244
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,609
Shit, I got busted last week
for jaywalking.

245
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,051
J: You got busted for being too fat.
Shut up, dickhead!

246
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,497
Oh, King. King, the trolls
are partying tonight
at the Western squat.

247
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,934
King?

248
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,567
Why doesn't anybody
fucking listen to me around here?

249
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,459
Hey, Mouse. How old are you?
Almost 18.

250
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,568
How come you moved to Holly-weird?
Just wanted to.

251
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,129
You wanna be a movie star, don't you?
No.

252
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,938
Yeah, you do.
No, I don't.

253
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:13,931
Why not?
I'm gonna be one.

254
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,376
Yeah, after you lose
about 1 00 pounds.

255
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,258
Brenda, I think you have star quality.

256
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,576
Yeah. Julia Roberts,
eat your heart out, baby.

257
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,174
Yeah, Sleeping With the Fat Girl.
BRENDA: Fuck you!

258
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,739
Fuck you, you stupid bitch.
KING: Hey, J.

259
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,175
J: Why don't you sit the fuck down.
BRENDA: Don't touch me.

260
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,650
KING: Hey, I had to sleep with
somebody for this big fucking joint.

261
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,015
No, I didn't.

262
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,895
Crasher. Have you seen Devon?
Is she here?

263
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:41,449
No, I ain't seen her,
but Tommy Ray is over there.

264
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,850
Is that right?
Yeah.

265
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,418
Tommy.

266
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,254
TOMMY:
Holy shit.

267
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,649
Well, well, well. lf it ain't the King
and his little band of butt pirates.

268
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,813
J: Hey, fuck you, man.
Fuck me? That's what I got in mind.

269
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:01,573
Who is this guy right here?

270
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,332
You know, for a kid,
you got a great ass.

271
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,774
I could make some money
with this kid.

272
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,659
I'm looking for Devon.
Yeah?

273
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,617
Well, who isn't?

274
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,136
Well, I ain't seen
the little cunt.

275
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,332
That's not quite how
I heard it, Tommy.

276
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,650
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you hear.

277
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,176
Because that little fucking bitch
was stealing from me.

278
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,491
She stole my radio,
she stole my rock.

279
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,049
So naturally, I kicked
the fucking bitch out.

280
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,532
I mean, the last I heard is that
she got her face cut up real bad
and just...

281
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:33,215
No, no. I know her.
She's not robbing or stealing
or thieving. Nothing.

282
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,972
So, what are you doing?
You calling me a liar?

283
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,338
Hey, Tommy Ray, you got
your whole life to be an asshole.

284
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,253
Why don't you take tonight off?

285
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,980
Why don't you go
fuck yourself, huh?

286
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,331
J: All right, all right. Get the fuck off
of him, man. Get the fuck off of him.

287
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,889
CRASHER:
Be cool, be cool.

288
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:54,498
KING: Come on, where is she?
Why don't you do me a favour.

289
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,857
Why don't you bring back your friend
as soon as he gets some pubic hair.

290
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,851
J: Fuck you, man!

291
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,410
Pubic hair, that's good.

292
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,133
Come on, Greg. Don't be needy.
Check me.

293
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,337
Come on. No, fuck that.
Man, fuck Tommy Ray!

294
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,253
You shouldn't have tossed
my fucking gun.

295
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,015
I'm glad I did too.
I feel like killing somebody.

296
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:20,890
INTERVIEWER: Does your family live
in the hole which is under
the bridge of the--?

297
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,131
KING:
Under the freeway, yeah.

298
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,054
But not always there.
It depends on the weather,

299
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,293
and who's with us or who's already
there, but that's basically our home.

300
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,294
BRENDA: I'll sleep with you, King.
KING: Oh, Brenda, now that's sweet.

301
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,736
I'm just not sure
I'm up to the challenge.

302
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:39,369
BRENDA: And why not, baby?
J: Because you're too fat is why not.

303
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,009
BRENDA: Shut up, fool!
J: Fuck you, bitch. I ain't no fool.

304
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:45,491
BRENDA: Yeah, you are.
You're a scrawny little piece of shit.

305
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:47,299
I'm sick of hearing your trap.

306
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,100
If I wanna sleep with King,
I'll sleep with King.

307
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,695
You know.
Keep your butt out of it.

308
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,499
Just shut the fuck up!
No!

309
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,380
Hey, J, stay out of her hair,
or she's gonna keep us up all night.

310
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,736
I know. I know.
Here. Here.

311
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:02,176
KING: Hey, where you guys staying?
BRENDA: We been at the Bowl Motel.

312
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,138
Shit, who's paying for that?
HEATHER: I paid for it.

313
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:07,532
Well, I ain't whoring.
J: Yeah, sure you ain't.

314
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,931
Listen, you save your money.
This one here will take you
for a ride.

315
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,216
I'm gonna get a job.

316
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:15,499
You know shit, dick-for-brains.
It's, "You know dick, shit-for-brains."

317
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,778
So get one.
I think either is correct.

318
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,610
It's a declarative sentence,
so the juxtaposition of the adjective
is appropriate in either case.

319
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:26,490
Hey! Nobody here take
any of Heather's money.
I'd take that personal.

320
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,334
J: Oh, okay, King.
I won't take it from her.

321
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:31,972
KING: I don't think that would be right.
J: Okay, I won't.

322
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,257
BRENDA: She's my buddy.
I'm taking care of her.

323
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:38,573
She's my buddy. Right?
Little J, what's the aerosol du jour?

324
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:41,494
I don't know, just something
I picked up in Nam.

325
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:45,372
When I was down in County,
Greg came down, but...

326
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:49,252
Like he was gonna get 500 bucks
to bail me out?

327
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,931
It's nice, though,
to have somebody that...

Hey, what's up?

330
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,058
You want some?

331
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:08,450
You should try and get some sleep.
Nah.

332
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,450
You gonna sleep
with Heather tonight?

333
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,812
Not tonight.

334
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:18,501
When I went in lockup,
I couldn't sleep for the first week.

335
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:21,739
I was used to the fucking freeway.

336
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,731
Have to get used to it again.

337
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:31,332

338
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,495
Yeah, I'm good.

339
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,256
I'm totally fucking tweaked.

340
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:44,331
Can I scratch that for you?

341
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:47,056
Can we do something
tomorrow night?

342
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,861
Yeah.
Can we?

343
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:51,614
Yeah.

344
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:54,781
I'd like that.

it's good to have you back, man.
Thanks.

It makes me feel better,
you know?

349
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,775
Can I have one?

350
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:28,012
Morning.
Hi.

351
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:31,538
That's the best I can do.
That's good.

Where'd you learn that?

I've been doing it forever.

at your nails?

and you can become very close.

How do you feel about that?

358
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,856
There's nothing I can do about it.

359
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:59,092
What were you
locked up for?

360
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:02,176
Assault with
a deadly weapon.

361
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:05,891
This bum was trying to rob me,
so I hit him with a bottle.

362
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:09,055
He got three stitches,
and I got three months.

363
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:10,291
One month suspended.

364
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:11,776
Brenda said you killed him.

365
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:14,820
Yeah, well, Brenda,
she says a lot of things.

366
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:18,054
I'd believe about...none of them.

367
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:24,179
Could I ask you a favour?

368
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,182
What kind of favour?
Oh, just a simple favour.

369
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,301
Maybe.

I can tell by the way he's acting.

He killed her.
Really?

00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,624
You don't need to touch him
or nothing.

00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,104
No.

666
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,703
Okay.

667
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,861
Sure is a sweet gun.

668
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,147
I mean, what's the use of a gun
if you ain't got no bullets?

669
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,548
It's pretty fresh.

670
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:15,107
Okay, it's your loss.
I mean,

671
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,149
it sure is a shame you don't got
any ammo for that fresh gun.

672
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,461

Greg? Can you open
the door?

wanna talk with you downstairs.

Dad, we got nothing
to say, man.

Just open the door.
I want to speak with you
downstairs.

We wanna talk with you downst--

to talk about. I'm 17 years old--

You're under arrest for grand theft.

Yeah.
When was the first time you had sex?

00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,947
I was about...

709
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:29,630
About 1 2.

710
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,502

When was the first time
you had sex with a man?

About 10 or 11 , I guess.

714
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:51,702
So you had sex with a guy
before you had sex with a girl.

Yeah.

if I could touch your face?

That's great.

747
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:19,309
I did that myself, left-handed.
Mm-hm. Wow.

748
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:21,588
My dad did this one
when I was 14.

Really?

750
00:46:24,473 --> 00:46:26,703
Do you still keep
in touch with him?

751
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:31,390

00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,304
I don't know. Um...

753
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:36,866
I don't know. He's probably
dead or something.

754
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,824
See, tattoos weren't
his only thing.

755
00:46:39,993 --> 00:46:43,030

all kinds of needles.

good these days.

758
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:56,583
Got a little cough,
though.

759
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:06,224
Some days I feel good,
some days I don't,
like everybody else.

760

Yeah, actually, I get along
with them really well.

761
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:10,145

or something.

When did you,
uh, start using?

775
00:47:56,993 --> 00:47:59,223
When I was about 10 or 11 .

776
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:04,391
Well, it says here the first time
you ran away, you were 9.

777
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:07,272
You ran to your mother's.
Why the hell did you do that?

778
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:09,623
I wanted to live with her.

779
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:12,668
But her and I don't get along so good.
Mm.

780
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,988
What about your father?
You, uh--? You like him?

781
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:18,831
Yeah, he's all right.

782
00:48:18,993 --> 00:48:21,063
But he got you arrested.

783
00:48:22,113 --> 00:48:23,626
Yeah, well, life goes on.

to a lockup, but you're in a rehab.

788

I'm a little hesitant to take you in.

789

of running away.

790
00:48:44,634 --> 00:48:47,989
I mean, what's my guarantee
that you're not gonna run
from us, huh?

791
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:50,748
Well, I need help with my problem.

792
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:56,943

Can you spare some change?
All I want is a little something to eat.

You gonna wiggle out of this thing?
Get off me!

get off of me, man.

Have you seen him?
I think I did see King.

804
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:25,353
I think he went down
to the corner.

Two for the price of one.

807
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:34,265
Hey, man, get the fuck off me!
I asked you a question.

808
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,311
Didn't you hear me?

809
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:39,790
Yeah, I fucking heard you.
"Yes, sir."

00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:44,152
"Yes, sir," asshole.

812
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,111
Yes, sir, asshole.
No!

813
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:52,352
Just "yes, sir."

814
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:55,145
Yes, sir.

815
00:49:56,554 --> 00:49:58,431
That's better.

816
00:50:02,354 --> 00:50:04,310
Where do I find King?

817
00:50:05,874 --> 00:50:08,867
Down at the hole.
The hole.

818
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,591
Nice hat.

819
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:22,665
You know, Tommy,
you're a punk bitch!

820
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:27,192
Oh, yeah, I almost
forgot something.

01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,752
Man, forget about it.
No, really, I'd like to know.

1004
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,150
Well, one or two reasons.

1005
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,233
Either your father molested you
or your stepfather did.

1006
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,637
You're a jerk.

1007
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,311
Why else would you
be here?

1008
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:41,357
That painting's really spooky.
Yeah, it's freaky.

1009
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,670
It looks like the devil.

1010
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,792
It looks like the Grim Reaper.

1011
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,153
My father didn't fuck me,
my brother did, so a lot you know.

1012
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,676
I'm sorry.

1013
01:05:02,921 --> 01:05:04,797
I am.

1014
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:24,711
Open the fucking register!
Get out of here! Fuck you!

1015
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,314
Motherfucker, sit down!
Back off! Stay the fuck down!

1016
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,316
Fuck you! I call the police
on you, motherfucker!

1017
01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:58,195
Checkout time was half-hour ago.
Oh, shit.

1018
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:04,354
I think we should get up and go
and get some more money
like we did yesterday.

1019
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,112
It was so good on the pier.
Listen.

1020
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:07,396
We could get something to eat.
Listen.

1021
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:12,191
That money? That's some of
the money I had with me
from Chicago.

1022
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,795
Oh.

1023
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:16,555
I didn't make anything
on the pier.

1024
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,791
Why'd you lie to me?

1025
01:06:20,521 --> 01:06:23,831
I don't know,
maybe I just thought I had to.

1026

(MUMBLES) I can't stand it.
What are you mumbling about?

1027
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:34,521
I don't want you to be me.
What are you talking about?

1028
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:37,559
I don't want you
to be me, Mouse.

1029
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:41,949
I see people on the street
every day and I just see myself,
and I don't wanna see you--

1030
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:46,114
I don't wanna see that happen to you.
It won't happen to me.

1031
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,752
Won't happen to us.

1032
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,752
I promise.

1033
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:08,800

Hi, Mom.
Greg?

1037

Greg, where are you?
What's the matter?

1038
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,312
Nothing.
Greg, are you all right?

1039
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:25,199
I love you.

J: Yeah.

1042
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,231
Well, I used to
when I lived in Boston.

1043
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:38,758
CHARLES: How long you live there?
J: About 1 3 years...

1044
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:42,118
then I moved to New York
for a while, and then
I came here.

1045
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:44,590
Did you like New York?
Nah.

1046
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,798
Well, you're a long way from Boston.
Yeah.

1047
01:07:47,961 --> 01:07:49,792
Why'd you leave?

1048

I broke my probation.
Yeah? What'd you do?

01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,959
Assault and battery.

1050
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:57,555
But that's bullshit.
I never should have gotten it.

1051
01:07:57,721 --> 01:08:00,873
All I did was hit this teacher
after she tried to hit me,

1052

and she never got
in trouble for it.

I could do that all night,
that ain't gonna help.

to do about it?

Yeah, they think you
killed Tommy Ray.

I didn't kill him.
I didn't touch anybody.

01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:54,596
I know you didn't.
He didn't do anything.

Where are you going?

1093
01:10:11,363 --> 01:10:13,593
Yeah, Dallas. Y'all ought to come
with me too.

Shit. It's great there.
We should, huh?

You wanna go
to Dallas?

1096

a big old lady with
some fucking gnarly--

Maybe a couple pit bulls.
How'd that be, huh?

Sounds good, doesn't it?
I don't know.

1099
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:27,994
Yeah, well, don't think
about it too long, King.

1100
01:10:28,163 --> 01:10:31,199

some speed, like I need it,
I'm off like a bride's nightie.

What's that smell?
That's you, motherfucker.

1102

That is you.
That's you.

1103
01:10:39,163 --> 01:10:40,596
That's you.
You smell very bad.

01:10:40,763 --> 01:10:42,992
It's you.
You're handsome, but you stink.

You stink.

1106
01:10:44,603 --> 01:10:47,481
No, seriously, though, man,
y'all ought to come with me.

1107
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,599
Fuck, I tell you what.

1108
01:10:49,763 --> 01:10:52,675
Why don't you meet me back here
in, say, like, a half-hour?

1109
01:10:53,043 --> 01:10:54,556
Come on, man, let's go.
Yeah. No, you're right.

1110
01:10:54,723 --> 01:10:56,998

You're right. I gotta get out too.

1111
01:10:57,163 --> 01:10:59,757
We'll get Little J and Greg,
and maybe we'll come.

1112
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:03,472
Yeah. Anyway, if I don't see you,
it's good knowing you.

1113
01:11:03,643 --> 01:11:06,396
Yeah, you too.
Yeah. Have a good life.

Take care.

I can.

1132
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:23,318

I didn't mean it, man.

my brother, man.

1137
01:13:39,004 --> 01:13:42,076
If I would've known
you couldn't handle the smack,
I never would've given it to you.

1138
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,752
I can handle it.
The fuck you can!

1139
01:13:44,924 --> 01:13:46,755
Look at you.

is wrong with you?

with you.

ended up on the streets and thinks
he's a bad man with an attitude.

1146
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:13,717
All right. From now on,
it's cash only.

1147
01:14:15,804 --> 01:14:18,080
Maybe that'll help you
slow down a little.

1148
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:20,594
You still got cash,
don't you?

1149
01:14:23,804 --> 01:14:25,237
Well, all right.

1150
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:27,315
What do you want?

1151
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:32,442
A quarter?
No.

1152
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,677
I'll give you a 20 piece.

1153
01:14:34,844 --> 01:14:36,880
That's it.
Okay.

1154
01:14:37,085 --> 01:14:38,995
Show me your cash.

1155
01:14:46,404 --> 01:14:47,679
Have you seen him?
You just missed him.

1156
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:50,564
And too bad for you.
He had a bunch of money
and bought me all this food.

1157
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:52,602
Where'd he go?
Hey, hey.

1158
01:14:52,765 --> 01:14:53,992
Where'd he go?

1159
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:58,238
To score some speed from Ted.
Shit. Thanks.

1160
01:14:58,605 --> 01:15:00,162
Young love. Sheesh.

1161
01:15:04,564 --> 01:15:07,363
You just do like we said, all right?
Okay.

1162
01:15:07,525 --> 01:15:09,992
Just leave it to me.
You stay in the hall.

1163
01:15:10,604 --> 01:15:12,914
You got your money?
Right here.

1164
01:15:17,484 --> 01:15:19,362
Is he here?

1165
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:21,164
Ted.

1166
01:15:21,325 --> 01:15:22,723
Look out, Vikki.
What the fuck?!

1167
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,159
Ted!
