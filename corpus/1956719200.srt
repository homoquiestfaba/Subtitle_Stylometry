00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,097
Okay.

384
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:44,631
And I'll look at it.

385
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,432
Okay.

386
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,333
Not that I'm a professional.

387
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:47,733
Here you are, he told me you

388
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,767
were in here.

389
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,236
Sister, you mind if I get just a

390
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,471
second?

391
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,773
Thank you.

392
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,773
Alright, bye.

393
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,143
What are you doing here?

394
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,678
Can we try this again?

395
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,414
Look, I'm married.

396
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,484
So, that's why you always alone?

397
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,485
You need to go.

398
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,620
Give me a second here.

399
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,755
Do you me to call security?

400
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,724
Let me just get a second.

401
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,428
I'm starting to understand who

402
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,529
I'm fuckin' with.

403
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,701
"Is it nefertiti

404
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,838
out to discover the riches

405
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,908
of the nile?

406
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,677
Or is it Cleopatra

407
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:32,744
ready to give up her life so

408
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,216
soon after I have given up mine?

409
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,653
If not two women whose names

410
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,323
are our history,

411
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,330
maybe Delilah out to rule this

412
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,832
Samson into a place of

413
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,202
vulnerability.

414
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,337
Shear my locks,

415
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,575
and then turn me over to others

416
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,277
who would do as they wish.

417
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,414
Who am I speakin' with?

418
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,816
Who, as uncannily expose

419
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,785
my delight in her,

420
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,954
and if I find out

421
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,890
that you are Eve

422
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,560
with a poison apple in your

423
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:25,364
grasp, I'm gonna ask me to bite.

424
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,367
But rather, tell me where we

425
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,702
will go after we get kicked

426
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,940
outta heaven later tonight

427
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,279
'cause not only do I excite and

428
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,548
things unknown, but I have a

429
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,318
tendency to be drawn to the...

430
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,619
Well, to the turbulence that

431
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,256
resides in a woman's loins

432
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,591
much like the calm resides

433
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:58,364
in the eye of a storm.

434
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,366
So if I never know, if I never

435
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,535
understand, I'm cool with that.

436
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:08,274
'Cause, you see, kal,

437
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,975
I don't mind bein' a man fucked

438
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:10,976
with...

439
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,548
As long as I ain't the man

440
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,950
fucked over.

441
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:21,853
So...

442
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,892
Tell me something:

443
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,528
Can I fuck with you?

444
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,930
Hmmm?"

445
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,035
This is starting to become a

446
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,605
regular thing here.

447
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,640
Kal, will, will, kal.

448
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,309
Hello.

449
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,575
Hi, how are you?

450
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,610
It's a pleasure.

451
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,512
Hey.

452
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,646
Now, you are the first

453
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,914
woman that he's had a connection

454
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,916
with since he's been here.

455
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,418
And I am trying to figure out

456
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,019
what you been hitting him with.

457
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,587
This is why you shouldn't have

458
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,623
an older brother.

459
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,059
When you get tired of a young

460
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:00,960
thing, you know...

461
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:03,795
[ Laughs ]Okay.

462
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,030
He's funny.

463
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,533
Yeah, he's funny.

464
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,402
So, what does he mean, like,

465
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,571
since you been back?

466
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,673
Oh, will and I grew up in

467
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,841
Philly.

468
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:16,709
He's been out here for a minute,

469
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,010
I joined three months ago.

470
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,381
Did you ever go on the mic back

471
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,382
there?

472
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:26,685
Nah.

473
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,456
I feel like dudes...

474
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,458
A lot of dudes get up, and they

475
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,992
pimp poetry for pussy.

476
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,694
You know what I mean?

477
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,095
Well, yeah,

478
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,363
you know what I mean 'cause you

479
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,430
thought I did the same thing.

480
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,731
No, I didn't think that.

481
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,367
I think it's wack, and I'm not

482
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,369
really into pimping myself like

483
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,636
that.

484
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,505
What about you, you been back

485
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:46,406
east?

486
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:47,906
Well, I'm hoping to go to

487
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:48,940
New York and perform at the

488
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,742
nuyorican.

489
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:51,843
Word.

490
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,379
I've been to the nuyorican.

491
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,914
Bad poets there, too.

492
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,583
Uh, it's the mecca in regards to

493
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:58,784
poetry.

494
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,586
It's a place.

495
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,754
You sexy, kal, you know that?

496
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,857
And I'm married, he's home

497
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:06,858
asleep.

498
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,495
And your husband lets you roam

499
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,796
the streets at night?

500
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:11,564
He's not that interested

501
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,698
in poetry.

502
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,900
Fuck poetry,

503
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:15,901
what about his wife?

504
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,406
Good question.

505
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,540
That question means I needs to

506
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,541
get home.

507
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:26,912
Okay.

508
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:29,649
So, I guess I shouldn't have

509
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,716
said the whole sexy thing and

510
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,384
talk about your husband, huh?

511
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,554
Wow, persistent.

512
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,656
No, interested.

513
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:38,558
This is me.

514
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,058
Okay.

515
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,727
Interested in what?

516
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,030
Interested in your story.

517
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,767
And what's your story?

518
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,038
Heartbreak.

519
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,713
Rebirth.

520
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,518
I'm trying to find my place,

521
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,519
you know?

522
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,122
I never expect you to be at a

523
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,692
loss for words.

524
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,798
Well, delivering poems and

525
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,000
writing poems...

526
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:22,869
That's totally different than

527
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,070
talking real shit.

528
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,405
And this is real shit.

529
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,979
Well, I gotta go home, Curtis...

530
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,947
Jackson.

531
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,883
Curtis Jackson.

532
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,551
You don't have to laugh at it,

533
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,487
that's my name.

534
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,487
Kalindra

535
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,858
stepney.

536
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,993
That's your name.

537
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:48,961
That's my name.

538
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,863
Kalindra stepney.

539
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,166
Kalindra stepney, you remind me

540
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,669
of a line from Shakespeare.

541
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,738
"To be or not to be?"

542
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,007
"In thy face, I see honor,

543
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,175
truth, and loyalty."

544
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,113
And where's that from?

545
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,791
That can't happen.

546
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:30,269
What?

547
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,203
Is the poem in your head that

548
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,105
damn good?

549
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,806
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, honey.

550
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,807
What'd you say?

551
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,509
Steve and i...

552
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,944
Daph, this guy has been really

553
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:39,712
shitty to you.

554
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,513
He's different since we've

555
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,681
gotten back together.

556
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:43,749
Are you laughing?

557
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,983
Well, okay,

558
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,918
picture this: Until I can find a

559
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,119
decent motherfucker that will

560
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,924
love me and also my kid, then

561
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,527
Steve's all I got.

562
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,029
You ever met someone who moved

563
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,632
you from the moment you met him?

564
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,535
Negro, if I had I wouldn't be

565
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,004
with Steve's ass right now.

566
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,639
Well, he might still be out

567
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,575
there, and if you get with this

568
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,241
fool, you're never gonna meet

569
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:09,742
him.

570
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:13,311
Or maybe I've already met him,

571
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,980
I just have to ride a rough time

572
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:15,782
right now.

573

00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,896
Look, you deal with your shit

1330
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:15,732
before you try to get into mine.

1331
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:18,067
Then we can be cool.

1332
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,068
Alright?

1333
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,506
I like that green.

1334
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:23,874
It's money.

1335
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,580
Don't tell that nigga my

1336
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,247
business.

1337
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:32,215
Come on, kalindra.

1338
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,617
I mean, I was at the hospital

1339
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:34,918
with you, I let you stay at my

1340
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:36,052
place when Ronnie was cuttin'

1341
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:36,754
out.

1342
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:37,655
What the hell was I supposed to

1343
00:57:37,656 --> 00:57:38,688
say when Steve asked?

1344
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:39,189
You say it's none of his

1345
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,223
business.

1346
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,559
Okay, I'm sorry.

1347
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,593
He shouldn't have said anything.

1348
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:44,861
You're damn right.

1349
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,930
Kalindra, I'm sorry.

1350
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:47,898
At least I know what I can tell

1351
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:48,898
you and what I can't.

1352
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,535
Work on that poem.

1353
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:52,603
It's flat.

1354
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,640
Uhh.

1355
00:57:56,674 --> 00:58:04,147
"My aches ache.

1356
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,717
My pain sings out.

1357
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:11,120
Fuck this.

1358
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,990
Who the fuck gives a fuck?

1359
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:14,959
Does someone give a shit about

1360
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,627
me, my pain, my shit?

1361
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:18,662
I'm sick of being the bitch

1362
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:22,198
for you, motherfucker.

1363
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:22,867
Do I feel guilty about how I

1364
00:58:22,868 --> 00:58:23,967
live my life?

1365
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:25,168
Fuck yeah.

1366
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,903
But not the guilt you think,

1367
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:28,905
you low piece of shit."

1368
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:29,574
Kalindra, wake the fuck up.

1369
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:31,074
Hey.

1370
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:32,842
You were mumbling in your sleep.

1371
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:33,843
Which?

1372
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:37,246
Um,

1373
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:37,982
uh, the blue.

1374
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:39,283
Blue? Okay, purple.

1375
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:41,284
The manager from sav-on really

1376
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:42,886
liked me other day,

1377
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:43,520
just called, said that the

1378
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:44,721
district manager wants to meet

1379
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:45,189
me.

1380
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,090
I think they're going to hire

1381
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,991
me.

1382
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,272
That's good, that's really good.

1383
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,128
Have a good interview.

1384
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:03,006
This bitch is married and you

1385
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,308
boned her anyway?

1386
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:08,678
Why?

1387
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,179
'Cause I like her, bro.

1388
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,748
I fucking like her, man.

1389
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,249
All the shit that you find

1390
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,585
yourself in, why would you put

1391
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:16,786
yourself in the same situation

1392
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,022
you were in back in Philly?

1393
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:19,824
It's not the fucking same

1394
00:59:19,825 --> 00:59:20,890
situation as chantelle

1395
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:21,659
in Philly.

1396
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,627
It's the same situation except

1397
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:25,194
now you're doing what was done

1398
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:25,996
to you!

1399
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,331
How does that make you feel?

1400
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:29,666
She's exactly what I need right

1401
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:30,667
now.

1402
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,271
No, what you need

1403
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,641
is a job

1404
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:38,843
and some common sense.

1405
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,880
Don't turn this into some love

1406
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:45,650
at first sight bullshit.

1407
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:49,687
[ Knock at front door ]

1408
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,164
Hey.

1409
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:02,331
Lots of construction, huh?

1410
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,333
Hey, will.

1411
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,369
What goes on between you and

1412
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,671
your husband is none of my

1413
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:10,073
business, but he is my business,

1414
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,876
and you shouldn't be here.

1415
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,820
You told him I was married?

1416
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,354
And now he hates me.

1417
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,355
No, he doesn't hate you.

1418
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,691
He's my older brother, so he's

1419
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:29,225
trying to protect me, kalindra.

1420
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,327
He doesn't fuckin' hate you.

1421
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,696
Old girl, what's her name?

1422
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:33,730
Chantelle?

1423
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,331
Yeah.

1424
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:35,232
She must've really done a job on

1425
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:37,201
you more than you're letting on.

1426
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:45,041
I put chantelle's boyfriend in

1427
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:47,877
the hospital.

1428
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:50,113
That's why she won custody.

1429
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,181
I spent three and half years in

1430
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:53,182
jail.

1431
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:55,318
Jail?

1432
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,754
I threw her boyfriend, his name

1433
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:58,955
was Kevin, I threw his stupid

1434
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:00,090
ass off a balcony.

1435
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,792
Paralyzed him from the waist

1436
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:04,894
down.

1437
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,996
Oh my god.

1438
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,835
And here I am trying to get it

1439
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,370
back.

1440
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,205
When did you get out?

1441
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,041
A week before I came here, and

1442
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,709
the worst part about it is that

1443
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,877
she wasn't even sleeping with

1444
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:21,978
the dude.

1445
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:23,479
Why did it happen?

1446
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,181
He thought that she was breaking

1447
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,850
up with him to get back with me.

1448
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:30,286
He came at me...

1449
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:31,822
He came at me with a gun.

1450
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,925
I lost my cool.

1451
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,864
Wow.

1452
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,268
Well,

1453
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:47,771
that's the past.

1454
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:48,972
You can start your life over

1455
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:50,206
now.

1456
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,408
I did, kalindra.

1457
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:57,914
And then along came

1458
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:59,382
this really pretty,

1459
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:01,985
bright, passionate

1460
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:02,986
poet.

1461
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,224
With the same fucking baggage.

1462
01:02:10,995 --> 01:02:13,263
It scared the shit out of me.

1463
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:33,850
I thought I recognized you,

1464
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:34,851
kalindra.

1465
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,220
Hey, miss Leona.

1466
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,788
Hey, baby.

1467
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:39,823
I just stopped in to pick up

1468
01:02:39,824 --> 01:02:40,957
some food on my way home from

1469
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,091
work.

1470
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,092
Yes, ma'am.

1471
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:47,563
Um, miss Leona is one of my

1472
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:49,365
mother's friends.

1473
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,134
And he is?

1474
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,970
I'm one of kalindra's friends.

1475
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:55,438
We met at a poetry reading,

1476
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:56,505
like a lounge.

1477
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,540
Yeah, he's helping me.

1478
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,108
We're actually going over some

1479
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,944
poetry, and he's kinda coaching

1480
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,111
me along.

1481
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,379
You a poet, kalindra?

1482
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,380
Yes, ma'am.

1483
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,381
Well, charlayne never told me

1484
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:06,582
about that.

1485
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:07,917
Well, she thinks it's just a

1486
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:08,886
phase.

1487
01:03:08,887 --> 01:03:11,020
Mmm, well, if your mama don't

1488
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,456
know you, who does?

1489
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:16,793
Anyway, I gotta go.

1490
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,196
I'm here to pick up a to-go

1491
01:03:19,197 --> 01:03:20,429
order.

1492
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,565
Okay, I'll check on that.

1493
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:25,235
Here you go.

1494
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,208
Good luck with your poetry,

1495
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:32,209
baby.

1496
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:33,077
Thank you, ma'am, I appreciate

1497
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:34,077
it.

1498
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:38,983
Definitely gonna hear about

1499
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:39,884
that, huh?

1500
01:03:39,885 --> 01:03:42,085
God, am I.

1501
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:44,020
Yeah.

1502
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:45,354
You tell your brother

1503
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:46,422
I won't my shithead husband

1504
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,925
anywhere near you.

1505
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,461
You tell your shithead husband

1506
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:54,230
that I can handle myself.

1507
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:55,532
I can see that.

1508
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:02,973
So you're sure you're not gonna

1509
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:05,408
run from me

1510
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:09,645
and this thing we got going

1511
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:10,646
'cause old girl saw us?

1512
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,317
Well, it'll come to a natural

1513
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:14,451
end anyway, right?

1514
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,053
Everything comes to a natural

1515
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:17,621

01:43:07,349 --> 01:43:08,982
whispered between your sorrowful

2447
01:43:08,983 --> 01:43:11,918
makeup cries of a abused child

2448
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:15,889
who became a gnarled man.

2449
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:18,925
Well, I wanna answer

2450
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:23,230
as a matter of fact, I am happy

2451
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:27,000
to answer your question

2452
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:33,274
I am me

2453
01:43:33,275 --> 01:43:34,741
now, hold on

2454
01:43:34,742 --> 01:43:35,876
because when I say that you get

2455
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:37,311
confused, it's understandable

2456
01:43:37,312 --> 01:43:38,679
because when you tell someone

2457
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,846
who doesn't really know you

2458
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:41,648
the answer to the question is me

2459
01:43:41,649 --> 01:43:43,016
they don't think of me,

2460
01:43:43,017 --> 01:43:43,885
they think of the me they have

2461
01:43:43,886 --> 01:43:45,752
created, only that's not the me

2462
01:43:45,753 --> 01:43:46,753
I'm talkin' about

2463
01:43:46,754 --> 01:43:47,821
I'm talkin' about the me you

2464
01:43:47,822 --> 01:43:49,290
don't see, the me you take

2465
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:50,691
for granted, the me that doesn't

2466
01:43:50,692 --> 01:43:51,892
even know it's me until I say

2467
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:55,796
'oh yes, that's me'

2468
01:43:55,797 --> 01:43:58,299
in all my motherfuckin' glory

2469
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,966
and all my fucked-up-ness

2470
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:01,602
and all the ways I have yet to

2471
01:44:01,603 --> 01:44:02,437
understand

2472
01:44:02,438 --> 01:44:04,738
bitch? Yeah, that's me

2473
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,407
selfish? That's me, too

2474
01:44:06,408 --> 01:44:09,343
angry, bitter, loving, warm,

2475
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:12,746
tender, brilliant... all me

2476
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:13,880
so damn me that I don't know who

2477
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:15,849
me is 'cause I got so many mes

2478
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:17,619
wrapped up in me

2479
01:44:19,654 --> 01:44:21,323
but I figured this shit out

2480
01:44:24,626 --> 01:44:27,361
and I want the clock to go back

2481
01:44:27,362 --> 01:44:29,730
I wanted to take you and me all

2482
01:44:29,731 --> 01:44:32,666
the way back to the very first

2483
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:34,468
time you asked me that question

2484
01:44:34,469 --> 01:44:36,002
to the very first time you were

2485
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:38,472
so fucking confused by my me

2486
01:44:38,473 --> 01:44:39,806
that it wasn't really a question

2487
01:44:39,807 --> 01:44:41,308
it was a condemnation,

2488
01:44:41,309 --> 01:44:42,909
an accusation, a way of puttin'

2489
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,345
me in my place

2490
01:44:44,346 --> 01:44:46,380
so go for it

2491
01:44:46,381 --> 01:44:48,882
ask me

2492
01:44:48,883 --> 01:44:49,883
who the fuck do you think you

2493
01:44:49,884 --> 01:44:51,519
are, kalindra?

2494
01:44:54,489 --> 01:44:55,390
Well, motherfucka, I'm glad

2495
01:44:55,391 --> 01:44:57,424
you asked

2496
01:44:57,425 --> 01:44:58,959
like yahweh, god formed from

2497
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,462
the word 'hayah': I am

2498
01:45:01,463 --> 01:45:03,430
I am the Alpha and omega

2499
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:05,799
I am strong, I am weak

2500
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,834
I am kind and I am filled with

2501
01:45:07,835 --> 01:45:09,069
the kind of love that you will

2502
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:10,771
never take away

2503
01:45:10,772 --> 01:45:12,839
I am sick of your shit, so i'm

2504
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,375
gonna stop this date from ever

2505
01:45:14,376 --> 01:45:15,776
becoming a relationship

2506
01:45:15,777 --> 01:45:17,544
so you will never lay your hands

2507
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:20,080
on me and curse me and abuse me

2508
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:21,382
because you don't know who the

2509
01:45:21,383 --> 01:45:22,749
fuck you are

2510
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,885
I am going to allow this

2511
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:27,053
back to the future moment to be

2512
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:29,890
so that I will never lose sight

2513
01:45:29,891 --> 01:45:31,992
of the very simple but true fact

2514
01:45:31,993 --> 01:45:33,760
that I am

2515
01:45:33,761 --> 01:45:36,730
me

2516
01:45:36,731 --> 01:45:38,966
That's who the fuck I am!

2517
01:45:40,034 --> 01:45:44,406
[ Cheers and applause ]

2518
01:45:45,907 --> 01:45:48,008
When I realized why I thought

2519
01:45:48,009 --> 01:45:49,976
I was writing poetry and why I

2520
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:51,645
wasn't really living

2521
01:45:51,646 --> 01:45:54,381
was the same,

2522
01:45:54,382 --> 01:45:56,850
things change.

2523
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:57,819
And I didn't need to get the

2524
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:59,554
approval I'd been seeking.

2525
01:46:01,122 --> 01:46:02,823
I'd fooled myself into thinking

2526
01:46:02,824 --> 01:46:04,958
I was expressing my problems in

2527
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:07,160
my poems.

2528
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:09,129
I was lying.

2529
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:10,163
I hadn't even told myself the

2530
01:46:10,164 --> 01:46:12,433
problems.

2531
01:46:12,434 --> 01:46:14,435
I took his abuse, but I accepted

2532
01:46:14,436 --> 01:46:16,670
my own toward myself and

2533
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:18,405
I didn't need to.

2534
01:46:18,406 --> 01:46:20,975
No one needs to.

2535
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:25,145
If where you are in life doesn't

2536
01:46:25,146 --> 01:46:27,180
feel right in your heart,

2537
01:46:27,181 --> 01:46:28,815
and if what's in your heart

2538
01:46:28,816 --> 01:46:32,419
doesn't feel right in your life,

2539
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,954
you have to make yourself heard

2540
01:46:33,955 --> 01:46:35,590
after you hear yourself.

2541
01:46:37,559 --> 01:46:38,793
That wasn't taught to me.

2542
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:41,596
The women in my life never

2543
01:46:41,597 --> 01:46:43,430
spoke the things that were

2544
01:46:43,431 --> 01:46:45,131
in their hearts.

2545
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:46,667
Maybe they never spoke it

2546
01:46:46,668 --> 01:46:48,001
because they were scared, not

2547
01:46:48,002 --> 01:46:49,135
of their husbands, but where

2548
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:50,904
their lives would be if they

2549
01:46:50,905 --> 01:46:52,473
were alone,

2550
01:46:52,474 --> 01:46:54,107
if they decided not to bear the

2551
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:55,876
burden women are expected to

2552
01:46:55,877 --> 01:46:57,845
willingly bear.

2553
01:47:00,114 --> 01:47:01,582
Sometimes we focus too much on

2554
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,751
how we'll be seen and judged.

2555
01:47:05,687 --> 01:47:06,787
And if we don't have people in

2556
01:47:06,788 --> 01:47:08,789
our lives who won't harm us

2557
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,190
because of the hate they have

2558
01:47:10,191 --> 01:47:11,725
for themselves, then life is

2559
01:47:11,726 --> 01:47:13,827
pretty miserable.

2560
01:47:13,828 --> 01:47:15,061
And who wants to lead a

2561
01:47:15,062 --> 01:47:16,062
miserable life?

2562
01:47:17,799 --> 01:47:19,600
So, I told myself,

2563
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:21,201
"before you write another word,

2564
01:47:21,202 --> 01:47:23,770
find out who you are

2565
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:25,238
so this sort of thing

2566
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:29,075
never happens again."

2567
01:47:29,076 --> 01:47:30,577
I think that if you are to be

2568
01:47:30,578 --> 01:47:32,613
very true to yourself

2569
01:47:32,614 --> 01:47:35,148
and listen,

2570
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:37,751
really listen to the things

2571
01:47:37,752 --> 01:47:39,152
you never say,

2572
01:47:39,153 --> 01:47:40,554
you won't have to be in this

2573
01:47:40,555 --> 01:47:42,756
room or in a prison cell

2574
01:47:42,757 --> 01:47:45,692
or in the jail of your own fears

2575
01:47:45,693 --> 01:47:46,927
writing when the truth is

2576
01:47:46,928 --> 01:47:49,262
waiting on you to just speak it.

2577
01:47:49,263 --> 01:47:51,565
But you have to listen.

2578
01:47:51,566 --> 01:47:55,168
You have to be quiet and listen,

2579
01:47:55,169 --> 01:47:56,202
not to the garbage everybody

2580
01:47:56,203 --> 01:47:57,871
puts into your soul, the things

2581
01:47:57,872 --> 01:48:00,106
you fight every day just to make

2582
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:01,908
yourself feel worthy of walking

2583
01:48:01,909 --> 01:48:03,244
this earth...

2584
01:48:07,214 --> 01:48:08,149
You have to listen to your

2585
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:09,483
spirit.

2586
01:48:11,653 --> 01:48:15,089
Listen to your soul.
