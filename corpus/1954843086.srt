<i> Now this may well be the worst run

53
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:01,600

Excuse me.

61
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:16,320
For them, East Mission

62
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,080
... infected with the zombie virus. 

63
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,784
With no evacuation in sight,

64
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,900
<i> they depend on the tents

65
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:23,758
... and the drugs inside,

66
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,440

We're not going to get a million plus hits

70
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,903
Alright, then so let's talk about people.
Let's tell their story.

71
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,734
Nobody cares about these people...

72
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,110
... unless they're eating other people.

73
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,760
Fine,

74
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:45,625
You look like shit, man.
Whatever.

75
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,471
Mind you...

76
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,081
They might care about her.

77
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,267
Oh, com'on!

78
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,402
Watch me take this chick viral.

79
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:58,041
<i> Yeah, It's always the pretty ones, </i>

80
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:00,207
Excuse me.
Hi.

81
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:01,930
Chase Carter, Hit Point Digital.

82
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:04,391
Can I ask you a few questions?

83
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,103
- On camera?
-I'm not interested.

84
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,305
Really?

85
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:10,459
This is your chance to tell your government...

86
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,947
... How you feel about being abandoned.

87
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:13,366
Stuck here...

88
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:14,951
... next to them.

89
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,611
Anything you want to say.

90
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:23,670
Alright, fine.

91
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:25,919
Great. What's your name, again?

92
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,754
- Crystal.
- Crystal.

93
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,204
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

94
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:32,243
Crystal, do you feel your government
abandoned you?

95
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,240
What I think is if all these
people were not infected,

96
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,406
we would all be on the
bus right now.

97
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,993
But this is what happens.
They mess up, and we get screwed.

98
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,041
And then guys like you
come down here with your cameras...

99
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,400
... and film it make money selling
commercials. It's awesome.

100
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:50,680
Don't you think that the American people
deserve to know the truth?

101
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,907
The American people
don't give a shit.

102
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,202
Right.

103
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,148
You don't seem too
concerned about zombies, themselves.

104
00:07:58,567 --> 00:07:59,869
You serious?

105
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,409
They terrify me.

106
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:08,146
Only an idiot wants to see a zombie.

107
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,789
That went really, really well.

108
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,263
I'll totally will send.

109
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:20,319
Laugh it up, but we are
the only ones with the balls...

110
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,063
... to cover this
thing from the inside.

111
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,894
So, what does that make you,
the next Frank West?

112
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:25,035
Why not?

113
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,267
Because he almost died.

114
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,626
You're gonna risk your life for this story?

115
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,727
- No.
- No.

116
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,148
But I'm willing to risk yours...

117
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:36,110
I've got an idea.

118
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:37,639
- Come on.
- God...

119
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:38,827
Com'on.

120
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:44,931
Follow me.

121
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,617
Shit.
Chase, no.

122
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:53,442
We are not going to get anything
from these people by embarrassing them.

123
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:55,006
We want drama,

124
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,795
we've got to get the needles.

125
00:08:56,862 --> 00:09:00,614
No, no. I didn't come here
to explore people.

126
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:03,103
This is how we are going
to make a name for ourselves.

127
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:10,469
You know what?

128
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:11,791

129
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,434

00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,535
Hey!
Is this your van?

181
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:06,103
Yes.

182
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:07,924
Yes, it is.

183
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:10,592
Okay, listen...

184
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,456
We need to go, now.
Now!

185
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,746
But my daughter.

186
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:21,621
Jesus Christ.

187
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,242
Did she bit you?

188
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:26,502
She tried.

189
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,480
- Come on,
- She tried.

190
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,158
Com'on.

191
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,114
No no no,

192
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,684
We need to leave now,
We need to leave now.

193
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,784
- Give me the keys!
- Come on!

194
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:42,693
Let's go!

195
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:48,320
Okay, let's go.

196
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,297
Oh shit! Get the gate!
Get the gate!

197
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:55,506
Go! Start! Go!

198
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,039
Drive!

199
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,584
Go!

200
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,486
What the hell happened back there?

201
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,128
The drug stopped working.

202
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,617
Who are you calling?

203
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:46,925
My ex-boss.

204
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:49,108
I'm gonna break this story.

205
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:52,329
So the zombie body count
is up to 2,500 now.

206
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,432
There would be more if the golf club
hadn't broken.

207
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:58,642
Hey.

208
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:00,964
I've covered wars, you know.

209
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,571
And saved a lot of people in Willamette.

210
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,285
- Excuse me.
- Kids, mainly.

211
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:09,090
Chase, I told you, St, Louis
was a one time thing.

212
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:10,757
Screw St. Louis.

213
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:12,398
I just left the Mega Dome,

214
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,349
and it's funny, I didn't see any
UBN reporters around.

215
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,926
You're inside?

216
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:19,775
<i> - Yeah, I am.
- UBN exclusive? </i>

217
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,319
No way.

218
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,704
Look, I want your audience, but you've gonna
to link it back to Hit Point.

219
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,416
I need graphics,
now.

220
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:29,044
Stand by,
I want you live.

221
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,754
Hey, was your daughter taking Zombrex?

222
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,051
- Oh my God!
- Yes.

223
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,692
I make sure she takes it every single day.

224
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,600
<i> Chase, did they run out of Zombrex? </i>

225
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,478
<i> No, there was plenty of Zombrex. </i>

226
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,740
I saw them take it,
but they turned anyway.

227
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,196
I'm telling you that
Zombrex didn't work.

228
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:59,344
<i> Startling, live reporting from Chase Carter. </i>

229
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,174
<i> Contributing reporter for... </i>

230
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,078
<i> ... Hit Point Digital. </i>

231
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,530
Do you know a way out?

232
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,159
Casey has a map.

233
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:18,978
Casey?

234
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,412
Casey was your daughter?

235
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:22,812
Do you think she's gonna be alright?

236
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:30,852
- Hey, watch the road!
- Look out!

237
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,490
Come on.

238
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,447
- Come on!
- Idiots.

239
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:26,780
- Hey, it's dead, it's dead.
- No! No!

240
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,191
Wait! Wait!

241
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,163
No! No!

242
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:03,747
Hey, open the gate.

243
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,150
Open the gate!

244
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:08,694
Open the goddamn gate!

245
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,460
Com'on, Jordan, pick up
the goddamn phone!

246
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:21,065
You know, instead of just standing around,
you should be looking for weapons.

247
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:24,386
A weapon? 
What weapon?

248
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:25,624
This place is full of junk.

249
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:30,939
Do you need me to hold your
hand for everything?

250
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:31,912
Make one.

251
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,280
<i> - Use lethal force if necessary. </i>
- What?

252
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:02,065
<i> The virus could be airborne. </i>

253
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:03,196
Airborne?

254
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:05,406
<i> If anyone gets out,
it can kill millions. </i>

255
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:06,490
Jesus.

256
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,052
Are you crazy?

257
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:17,780
You, go back. 
You can't come out.

258
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,447
What? No.

259
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,761
Turn around now.

260
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,203
No.

261
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:23,618
Walk.

262
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:25,020
- Now.
- Come on.

263
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:29,144
Listen, I'm not going back out there.

264
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,056
Help!

265
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,850
- Help!
- Wait! Let us in!

266
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:39,994
Shit.

267
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,698
Close the gate!
Watch her.

268
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:55,702
- No! No!
- Wait! Help us!

269
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,340
- Let me in!
- Come on, let us out!

270
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,815
<i> Come on, open the gate. </i>

271
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,286
<i> - Please, let us in!
- Now! </i>

272
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:09,346
Chase, where the hell were you?

273
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,910
I was 15 feet from the goddamn car.
You left me.

274
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:15,110
No, listen, they were all over me.
I couldn't see you.

275
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:16,362
Where are you now?

276
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:18,488
In some pawnshop downtown.

277
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,242
- Are you out?
- Come on, let us in!

278
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:23,668
- Please!
- Open the gate!

279
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,910
Yes, I just got through.

280
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:30,282
<i> - Help!
- Help! </i>

281
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,748
Jo? 
What's going on?

282
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,386
I don't know.

283
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:46,060
Turn back!

284
00:24:47,097 --> 00:24:48,147
Open up the gate.

285
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,442
Get away from the wall, now,
I have orders to shoot.

286
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:54,340
- Open up this goddamn thing now!
- Let us in!

287
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,319
Come on! This is my family right here.

288
00:24:57,594 --> 00:25:00,060
Jesus, What are you doing?

289
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:02,102
The virus is airborne, 
they could kill us,

290
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:04,402
This is your last chance,
get away from the wall.

291
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,073
Open up, please. Open up the gate!

292
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:10,828
Take her to quarantine.

293
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,160
Wait! What does he mean?

294
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,369
Com'on, please, 
my family, save us.

295
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:22,044
Dad!

296
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,160
Wait!

297
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:41,342
<i> Jo, you still there? </i>

298
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:44,797
Chase,

299
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,644
Chase...

300
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:54,190
They shot people.

301
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:56,812
They're shooting people.

302
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:00,898
Listen, you gotta get me out.

303
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:10,295
I don't... 
I don't think I can.

304
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:18,362
Wait.

305
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,687
We should stay here tonight.

306
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:23,682
There's no where to go, anyway.

307
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:25,023
Why not?

308
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:27,636
They're shooting people at the wall.

309
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,748
We're trapped.

310
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:36,230
<i> Authorities now suspect that
the East Mission virus is... </i>

311
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:38,350
<i> ... resistance to Zombrex. </i>

312
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:41,813
<i> Some media outlets are reporting
that may communicable ... </i>

313
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:44,663
<i> ... through touch or some kind
of airborne contact. </i>

314
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:48,113
<i> In response FEZA stopped all
evacuation efforts... </i>

315
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,634
<i> ... and have sealed the city.</i>

316
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,628
<i> For a view from inside, </i>

00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,300
<i> go again by
Hit Point's, Chase Carter. </i>

318
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,299
<i> Chase, </i>

319
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,612
<i> Those rumors are
completely false, Susan.</i>

320
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:58,796
<i> I'm with a small group... </i>

321
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,011
<i> ... right now, and we're all fine. </i>

322
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:02,220
<i> If you can pass
the virus by touch... </i>

323
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,452
<i> ... or by some airborne transmission, 
we'd know it. </i>

324
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:06,787
<i> Are you sure you're not infected? </i>

325
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,951
I have no symptoms, the people
I'm with have no symptoms, we're fine.

326
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:13,880
<i>Do you feel the  government 
has abandoned you? </i>

327
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:16,197
You're damn right I do.

328
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:17,975
What right do they have
to keep us here?

329
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:21,401
<i> Frank, does the Government have
the right... </i>

330
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,761
<i> ... quarantine our corespondent? </i>

331
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:25,697
<i> It's a zombie apocalypse,
And you're talking about right? </i>

332
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:27,462
<i> Jesus Christ! </i>

333
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,819
<i> Chase, Where I'm I look...? Chase. </i>

334
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:31,628
<i> Hey, listen, </i>

335
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,731
<i>you just keep reporting, OK? </i>

336
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:35,581
<i> You're doing a good
job in there, my man. </i>

337
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:37,547
<i> Alright, Frank, let's get back... </i>

338
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:39,798
<i> ... to the topic at hand. </i>

339
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:41,630
<i> I'm sure that the government is... </i>

340
00:27:41,654 --> 00:27:43,877
<i> ... working hard on a fix. </i>

341
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,340
<i> The government is working hard
on not shitting it's pants. </i>

342
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,497
<i>If this is a resistant strain... </i>

343
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,042
<i> ... they're going to burn everyone. </i>

344
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:52,617
<i> OK, we don't know that
they are going to burn anyone. </i>

345
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,769
<i> - No...
- We don't want to cause panic out there </i> ,

346
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:56,050
<i> What are you talking about? </i>

347
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,706
<i> If you're on the inside of this one, ah, shit, </i>

348
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,810
<i>You are really fucked. </i>

349
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,257
<i> OK. Fantastic. </i>

350
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:06,671
Celebrity isn't going to 
get you out of here.

351
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,497
Making people care might.

352
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:18,708
Drink.

353
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,499
Thanks.

354
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:24,529
Hey, Maggie.

355
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,352
Look,  know it might be hard.

356
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,280
But can I interview you?

357
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:32,638
I don't know...

358
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:35,028
I don't think that I have anything to say.

359
00:28:39,054 --> 00:28:41,674
Well you know,
sharing your story...

360
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:45,117
... it might help you with 
what happened to your daughter.

361
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:52,450
OK.

362
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,305
Great.

363
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,444
OK.

364
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,311
Go ahead.

365
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:04,199
Casey, she...

366
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,399
You have to understand that her dad...

367
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:08,863
... left us right after she was bitten.

368
00:29:09,257 --> 00:29:10,389
He...

369
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:13,174
...blamed me, I guess.

370
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:17,111
I was in the kitchen when it happened.

371
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,487
I got two of them.

372
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,667
But the third one...

373
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:26,151
... got to her crib.

374
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:31,331
It didn't do much damage.
You can barely see the scar,

375
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:33,049
I just...

376
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:38,921
I don't get to her in time.

377
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:43,858
So, it's just her and me now.

378
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:47,507
And she's not lust my daughter,

379
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:49,167
she is my best friend,

380
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:53,476
And we struggled... 
Well we still struggle.

381
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,740
But we get by.

382
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:02,311
And it makes us stronger.

383
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,340
You know, closer.

384
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:08,343
Even when she isn't in
the same room as me...

385
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:13,390
She is all I can think of.

386
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:17,691
I can't wait for you to met her.

387
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:23,039
She is such a wonderful little child.

388
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm going to feel much better
when I get to her.

389
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,090
You should eat.

390
00:30:42,364 --> 00:30:43,818
You've got to keep up your strength.

391
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,898
Turn around, and put
your hands on your head.

392
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:22,474
- Okay, just calm down,
- Do it now!

393
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:23,810
I'm not infected!

394
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,665
Turn around, and put
your hands on your head.

395
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,939
- OK!
- Now!

396
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:28,580
Stop.

397
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:30,437
Just relax.

398
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,082
I would like to save at
least one person today.

399
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:35,242
Hey, you know how to use one of these?

400
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:36,951
Yeah.

401
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,019
You want to tell me what's going on?

402
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,614
We think it is a resistant strain.

403
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:49,141
The evacuation is closed
until we know for sure.

404
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,834
You were the last person
 through the gate

405
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,799
And if it is positive?

406
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,795
Let's hope that's not the case.

407
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:46,066
- Hey.
- Jordan...

408
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,298
...I'm with a girl,
and she is infected.

409
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:52,536
Well, I'm sitting in a
plastic room...

410
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,511
... waiting for them to decide if 
they are going to shoot me or not.

411
00:34:56,075 --> 00:34:58,500
Is she showing symptoms?

412
00:34:58,535 --> 00:35:00,558
I saw her shooting up Zombrex.

413
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:04,561
And it worked.

414
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:08,587
That proves that 
it isn't a resistant strain.

415
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,605
So, her drug is different?

416
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:12,891
She's different?

417
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,537
Either way, that girl is evidence.

418
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:17,842
It's a huge story.

419
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,979
A story that could kill me in my sleep.

420
00:35:20,003 --> 00:35:22,491
Oh come Chase!
She is still human.

421
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,777
She's probably terrified.

422
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:28,251
And given the panic here, she
 is your best shot...

423
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:31,563
... To convince FEZA to left her out.
Then, you need to stay with her.

424
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,699
All I have to do is get her on camera.

425
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,576
If I can get something,
 can you get me out?

426
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:40,606
Yeah.

427
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,537
Yeah, I'll do everything I can.

428
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:44,763
And Chase...

429
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,401
... just make sure you know how
exactly how much she has left, okay?

430
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:51,935
Yeah.

431
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:16,960
Hey?

432
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,863
Hi.
 Here.

433
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:28,213
Thank you.

434
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:31,913
My daughter has one just like it.

435
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,187
Yeah.

436
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:39,870
Yeah, I know.

437
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,152
Don't worry, I'm going.

438
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:43,356
It's OK.

439
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,920
I know how it feels.

440
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:49,045
Casey and I have to
deal with it every day.

441
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:51,910
But you're not alone.

442
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,734
I always tell Casey that
in situations like these...

443
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:58,318
...that you have to
hold on to your friends.

444
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:01,708
They're not easy to find.

445
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,099
Well...

446
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:10,505
Thank you, but...

447
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:13,744
...I've got to go.

448
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:16,193
I'm almost out of time.

449
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,254
You're clear.

450
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:46,889
And I'm guessing that it's your truck,
messing up my camp.

451
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,615
Hey!

452
00:37:56,088 --> 00:37:57,830
It's not a resistant strain.

453
00:37:58,294 --> 00:38:00,295
Yeah, where did you go to medical school?

454
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,673
My partner is in there.

455
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,322
One of the people he's with has her 
own Zombrex and she is fine.

456
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:05,566
How do I know that?

457
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:07,744
Send a copter,
bring them out and test her.

458
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:09,551
Meanwhile...
I have a whole quarantine to run.

459
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:11,408
Researchers across the country 
are working on that.

460
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,700
Meanwhile you are shooting people.

461
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,855
- Healthy people.
- You think I like that?

462
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:16,972
You think I want that?

463
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,569
I am responsible for the
safety of the entire country.

464
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,193
I can't take a chance,

465
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,864
... on them, 
on your friend.

466
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:29,101
You want to give me proof?

467
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,333
You better make it quick.

468
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:57,312
Go, go, go!

469
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,119
<i> - Yes, sir,
- On the left side </i> ,

470
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:01,137
<i> - On me.
- Yes sir, </i> 

471
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:17,498
<i> New developments in the
Mission East quarantine... </i>

472
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,053
<i> The US military arrived, </i>

473
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:22,583
<i> and we go now live
to a press conference.</i>

474
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:23,902
<i> already in progress, </i>

475
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,532
Citizens, we are here to
support FEZA in any way we can.

476
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,238
This is a serious situation,

477
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:33,506
but there is no need to panic,

478
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:35,137
It is true,

479
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:37,516
tough choices have to be made.

480
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:39,250
and they will be taken,

481
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,120
and they will be made decisively.

482
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:44,902
I have been authorized
by the White House...

483
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,975
... to destroy the threat,
through military action.

484
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:52,562
This country is and will remain safe,

485
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,294
I expect fire bombing to commence...

486
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:57,182
... within 48 hours,

487
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,430
Thank you for your time.

488
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:14,132
<i> Frank, what advice do you have... </i>

489
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,397
<i> ... for those trapped in
inside the quarantine zone? </i>

490
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,398
<i> Turn off your television. </i>

491
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:22,289
<i> Put down your phones and
run for your goddamn life. </i>

492
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:24,815
<i> Run where? </i>

493
00:40:25,148 --> 00:40:27,655
<i> The quarantine is sealed,
there is nowhere to go. </i>

494
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:28,983
<i> What the hell are you talking about? </i>

495
00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:30,655
<i> Fine, Let me tell you something. </i>

496
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:33,072
<i> - Read my book.
- Oh, Jesus </i> ,

497
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:35,376
<i> Chapter 5,
I specifically tell you that... </i>

498
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,568
<i> ... can't worry about technicalities. </i>

499
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,605
<i> Okay? Screw the rules. </i>

500
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,752
<i> You have to improvise,
think on your feet... </i>

501
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:42,912
<i> ... use what you can, </i>

502
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,814
<i>where you can.</i>

503
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:47,331
<i> Maybe you shoot you down
 like a dog, maybe not, </i>

504
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:48,599
<i> But I'll tell you one thing... </i>

505
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:50,729
<i> Talking to us,
ain't going to help you at all. </i>

506
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,601
Sorry.

507
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:18,720
I didn't realize.

508
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:20,771
You don't owe me anything.

509
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,717
How are you feeling?

510
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:29,155
Hey?

511
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:31,164
Why do your drugs work and theirs didn't?

512
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,733
I have a dealer.

513
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,517
I hate those goddamn clinics.

514
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,078
You have any left?

515
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:54,793
Just one.

516
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,487
Do you know where to get more?

517
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,702
Oh thank God!

518
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:17,818
I thought you left me here.

519
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,908
Look, We need to stick together and 
come up with some kind of plan.

520
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:24,764
Yeah, well, I don't have time, so...

521
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:26,598
... I have to find some Zombrex...

522
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,038
... out there.

523
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:30,896
<i> is true. </i>

524
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,395
<i> Tough choices must be made. </i>

525
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:35,152
<i> Will be made. </i>

526
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:38,011
<i> And they will be made decisively. </i>

527
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,305
<i> I have been authorized
by the White House... </i>

528
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,304
<i> ... to destroy the threat,

529
00:42:43,424 --> 00:42:46,558
<i> I expect firebombing
to commence within 48 hours. </i>

530
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:22,035
Come on.

531
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,688
We've got five minutes, boys!

532
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:37,268
Get what you can!

533
00:43:37,374 --> 00:43:38,783
Let's go shopping.

534
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:40,363
Yeah!

535
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,940
Take everything!

536
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,314
Yeah.

537
00:45:10,987 --> 00:45:12,380
You're gonna get us killed.

538
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:50,562
You're a bad girl, huh?

539
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:52,978
Look at you.

540
00:45:54,395 --> 00:45:57,505
Yeah. Okay, okay...

541
00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:00,975
- You've got me.
- Leave the sword.

542
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:07,071
Logan!

543
00:46:07,814 --> 00:46:09,158
Logan!

544
00:46:10,191 --> 00:46:11,179
Now.

545
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,933
Move.

546
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:43,102
Yeah.

547
00:46:58,077 --> 00:46:59,243
I found my sword.

548
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:13,460
Maybe they can help us.

549
00:47:13,657 --> 00:47:15,931
- I don`t believe...
- You can trust me, I've got this.

550
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:17,380
- Honey, wait!
- Hey...

551
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:18,832
Hey, hold up!

552
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:21,134
Hey, guys.

553
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:23,933
Oh, Jesus.
 Thank God.

554
00:47:24,195 --> 00:47:25,742
We can go with you guys?
Please man, just...

555
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:27,515
We need help, man.

556
00:47:28,902 --> 00:47:30,011
It's OK, yeah, yeah.

557
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:34,044
Ten grand, one way.

558
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:35,890
What?

559
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:38,194
I don't have $10,000.

560
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:49,797
You should have just offered me the girl.

561
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:53,974
Now I get her for free.

562
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,830
- Fuck,
- Run!

563
00:47:57,977 --> 00:48:00,237
Run! Run!

564
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:12,841
Oh shit.

565
00:48:27,557 --> 00:48:28,725
Get off me!

566
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,170
Yeah!

567
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,388
No! No! Come back!

568
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:41,331
Stop! Get off of me!

569
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,101
- You want a ride?
- Yes!

570
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,165
Help! Please help me!

571
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:51,235
You should have ran.

572
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:52,888
No!

573
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:56,005
No!

574
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,412
No! Help me!

575
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,100
Please don't leave me!

576
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:16,170

<i> ... when you were confronted

587
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,599
<i>Well the first thing you want to do is
 take out as many as possible, </i>

588
00:49:41,655 --> 00:49:42,761
<i> Early.</i>

589
00:49:42,906 --> 00:49:44,702

590

00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:48,975

<i> You've got siblings? </i>

<i> They're going to be easier. </i>

595
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:57,518

00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,358
<i> Take short breaks... </i>

<i> ... to recover your stamina. </i>

598
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:05,814
<i> And then when you get down to the last one... </i>

599
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:07,296
<i> ... or two... </i>

600
00:50:08,398 --> 00:50:10,088

00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:17,850

604
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:23,989
<i> Wow, thank you. That was great. </i>

605
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,227
<i> Hey, and one more thing, kids. </i>

606
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:28,822
<i> Remember to build weapons. </i>

607
00:50:29,022 --> 00:50:30,242
<i>Lots of weapons. </i>

608
00:50:33,306 --> 00:50:34,891
Maggie, would you get some tape?

609
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:39,900
Help me.

610
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:49,151
You coming?

611
00:50:51,136 --> 00:50:52,138
Listen.

612
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:55,004
The only reason they are bombing
is they don't know you exist.

613
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:56,822
They didn't know your drugs is working.

614
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,939
We don't need to go out there.

615
00:51:01,801 --> 00:51:03,335
We just need to get you on camera.

616
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:07,892
Not happening.

617
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:27,650
Your daughter isn't out there.

618
00:51:36,085 --> 00:51:37,378
Good luck.

619
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:41,982
Damn!

620
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,444
Jordan,I have an idea.

621
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,426
Now, listen to me.

622
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,594
I need you to find some Zombrex.

623
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:01,807
Great.

624
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:17,746
Shit.

625
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:25,667
Goddammit!

626
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:32,398
Okay, we have to
do it quietly.

627
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:33,783
It's okay,

628
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:43,589
Hey!

629
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:48,597
You ready to die, 
you brain dead zombies fucks?

630
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:49,924
Come and get it!

631
00:53:36,443 --> 00:53:38,526
Chase! That's enough. 
Follow us.

632
00:53:49,177 --> 00:53:50,516
Motherfucker!

633
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:00,346
Com'on.

634
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,543
Thanks.

635
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,773
Get in.

636
00:58:02,556 --> 00:58:05,279
<i> Hey, right now,
 real quick, pop quiz. </i>

637
00:58:05,423 --> 00:58:06,697
<i> How would you kill me
if you could? </i>

638
00:58:06,905 --> 00:58:08,039
<i> Oh my God! </i>

639
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:10,163
<i> Right now, with my bare hands. </i>

640
00:58:11,928 --> 00:58:13,773
<i> You would lose against a zombie. </i>

641
00:58:13,797 --> 00:58:16,336
<i> BAd advice, don't try it with
bare hands, grab a weapon. </i>

642
00:58:16,635 --> 00:58:18,166
<i>Can I tell you how I would kill you? </i>

643
00:58:18,472 --> 00:58:20,422
<i> - I wouldn't
- You're killing me right now. </i> ,

644
00:58:20,446 --> 00:58:22,021
<i> Wouldn't, I wouldn't kill you. </i>

645
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:24,845
<i> If you were a zombie, I'd let you eat me. </i>

646
00:58:25,053 --> 00:58:26,173
<i> Oh God! </i>

647
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:29,598
<i> - This seems like a great place to...
- I'm kidding! </i>

648
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:31,247
<i> I'm kidding. I would smash your
 head in with a television.</i>

649
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:33,949
<i> I would smash your head in with that television right there. </i>

650
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,404
<i> I may be begging you to do that shortly. </i>

651
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:43,354
Do you still have Zombrex
stored inside the city?

652
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:45,498
- I'm very busy.
- Do you have supplies in there or not?

653
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,043
Why? So you can blame this on us?

654
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:49,121
So I can save lives.

655
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:52,924
How are you going to do that?

656
00:58:53,883 --> 00:58:56,398
I need to get some Zombrex
to a guy inside.

657
00:58:56,422 --> 00:58:58,253
I can prove that it's
not a resistant strain.

658
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:03,251
Counts and estimates.

659
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:05,503
We show have a look,

660
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:10,391
- But General, she's not...
- Don't worry.

661
00:59:11,342 --> 00:59:12,564
I was here.

662
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:16,914
- Listen...
- No!

663
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:21,494
Norton, you've got to help me out.

664
00:59:23,675 --> 00:59:24,697
Excuse me.

665
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:36,934
Jesus.

666
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:25,192
Thank you, Norton.

667
01:00:47,688 --> 01:00:48,819
Got it.

668
01:00:48,904 --> 01:00:51,768
Hey, I think I can get them to let us out.

669
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:54,334
Hey, did you hear me?

670
01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:19,006
Okay.

671
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,533
They've all been looted.

672
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:30,420
Jordan found something.

673
01:01:30,444 --> 01:01:32,687
A storage facility. There should be Zombrex there.

674
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:35,952
Come on, let's go.

675
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:07,040
Who the hell did this?

676
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:08,376
I don't know.

677
01:02:09,678 --> 01:02:11,298
Think they're still home?

678
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:28,141
Thanks.

679
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:48,652
Jesus Christ.

680
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,615
How are we supposed to find
anything in here?

681
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:53,398
Come on.

682
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:58,803
<i> You be my friend? </i>

683
01:03:15,919 --> 01:03:17,988
<i> You be my friend? </i>

684
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:25,523
<i> You want to be my friend... 
My friend? </i>

685
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:26,944
<i> My friend? </i>

686
01:03:29,049 --> 01:03:31,202
<i> Let's play a game. </i>

687
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:45,771
Hey where's Maggie?

688
01:03:52,325 --> 01:03:53,494
Okay, let's go,

689
01:03:57,655 --> 01:03:58,871
Is anyone living here?

690
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:25,304
Son of a bitch.

691
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,246
It's the same shit
from the stadium.

692
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:48,490
We still have to prove
the problem is with the drugs.

693
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,550
and not a new strain
of the virus.

694
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:52,423
Really, how?

695
01:04:54,303 --> 01:04:55,543
You take a dose.

696
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,107
If symptoms come on, we know
it doesn't work.

697
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:00,599
and then you can take
good stuff right away.

698
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:02,731
Are you kidding?

699
01:05:02,755 --> 01:05:04,351
If we can prove the drugs is bad,

700
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:06,483
and go public,
they will have to let us out.

701
01:05:07,758 --> 01:05:09,533
Yeah, go public.

702
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,614
Look, we can search every 
drug store in town.

703
01:05:12,213 --> 01:05:13,986
We still get firebombed tomorrow.

704
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:17,062
It's the only way.

705
01:06:08,816 --> 01:06:09,952
Take your camera.

706
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,549
<i> My friend... My friend. </i>

707
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:22,251
<i> Let's play a game.</i>

708
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:26,025
<i> Game... Game... Game, 
my friend.</i>

709
01:06:27,978 --> 01:06:30,613
<i> Will you be my friend... 
My friend? </i>

710
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,244
<i> Will you be my friend? </i>

711
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:43,343
<i> Be My Friend? </i>

712
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:52,662
<i> Will you be my friend? </i>

713
01:06:52,686 --> 01:06:53,444
<i> Be My Friend? </i>

714
01:07:01,508 --> 01:07:03,612
<i> Be my friend... 
Be My Friend? </i>

715
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:15,817
I'm sorry.

716
01:07:19,629 --> 01:07:20,890
Mommy's here.

717
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,950
Oh baby, I'm sorry.

718
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:32,917
<i> I love you. </i>

719
01:07:36,578 --> 01:07:38,465
<i> You're my friend. </i>

720
01:08:00,864 --> 01:08:04,047
This is Chase Carter,
recording Crystal LaRourke.

721
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,291
Crystal,

722
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:09,100
can you bring the vial to the camera?

723
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,863
This is the same batch that
they were using tn the Mega Dome yesterday.

724
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,473
As you can see...

725
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:24,688
... it has no effect.

726
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:28,978
Now this is her personal supply.

727
01:08:29,002 --> 01:08:30,325
not government issue.

728
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:36,459
Go ahead, Crystal.

729
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:42,588
Crystal!

730
01:08:43,808 --> 01:08:45,053
Help me.

731
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:45,921
Shit.

732
01:09:05,018 --> 01:09:06,119
You alright?

733
01:09:08,351 --> 01:09:09,359
Yeah.

734
01:09:18,263 --> 01:09:19,600
Oh shit!

735
01:09:20,512 --> 01:09:21,520
What?

736
01:09:49,495 --> 01:09:50,616
We're trapped.

737
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,164
<i> Frank... </i>

738
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,574
<i> We are here to talk about your
experience at Willamette...  </i>

739
01:10:08,598 --> 01:10:12,102

740
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:14,566

- How much hope do they have? </i>

741
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,726
<i> You're basically, are fucked. </i>

742
01:10:16,326 --> 01:10:18,464
<i> I'm sorry, but you are... </i>

743
01:10:18,488 --> 01:10:19,803
<i> That's great. </i>

744
01:10:19,827 --> 01:10:22,336
<i> Your book must have been one page. </i>

745
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,953
<i> "You're basically fucked" is
all it said. </i>

746
01:10:24,977 --> 01:10:26,918
<i> No, it's a lot of pages. </i>

747
01:10:26,942 --> 01:10:29,126
<i> You must be  "fucked" a hundred times? </i>

748
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,906
<i> -It's...
- Okay, so that's it </i> ,

749
01:10:31,946 --> 01:10:34,250
<i> Let's take a break... </i>

750
01:10:34,274 --> 01:10:37,671
<i> ... this informative chat with Frank West. </i>

751
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:40,703
<i> has a lot more pages, it doesn't 
say that. It has tons of words. </i>

752
01:10:50,214 --> 01:10:51,690
You think Maggies OK?

753
01:11:05,106 --> 01:11:06,195
There you go.

754
01:11:09,877 --> 01:11:11,194
Give me your phone.

755
01:11:12,706 --> 01:11:13,588
Why?

756
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:24,096
Hey wait, don't have to do that.

757
01:11:28,839 --> 01:11:30,405
You know, after Fortune City,

758
01:11:31,377 --> 01:11:33,990
everyone was so happy
me that I had survived, you know?

759
01:11:36,476 --> 01:11:37,520
But...

760
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:41,323
... that all change really quickly.

761
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,406
My friends started avoiding me,

762
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,679
my coworkers,

763
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,449
I was clerking at 
a law firm,

764
01:11:52,497 --> 01:11:55,860
and I spent my
last week in the basement.

765
01:11:57,849 --> 01:11:59,193
My fiance,

766
01:11:59,888 --> 01:12:02,752
he stuck around for 33 days.

767
01:12:05,763 --> 01:12:07,258
That was when I started hiding.

768
01:12:10,511 --> 01:12:11,755
I feel like that's...

769
01:12:12,888 --> 01:12:14,919
all I've done in
the last five years.

770
01:12:19,178 --> 01:12:22,423
Stay alive,
 but not really living.

771
01:12:24,884 --> 01:12:28,535
There is no point to hiding it now, 
so maybe it will help someone.

772
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,877
Who's...

773
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,034
Chris Krabowski?

774
01:12:43,758 --> 01:12:45,525
I changed my name.

775
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,512
Yeah, I...

776
01:12:52,964 --> 01:12:56,089
figured if I wanted to get famous,
I needed to change my name.

777
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,926
Not many stars out
there named Krabowski.

778
01:12:59,003 --> 01:13:00,156
Oh my God!

779
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:03,833
Well...

780
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,582
Since you fought off a horde 
of zombies single handily,

781
01:13:09,168 --> 01:13:10,822
you'll gonna be bigger than Frank West.

782
01:13:12,587 --> 01:13:13,727
Yeah.

783
01:13:20,956 --> 01:13:23,881
<i> This is Chase Carter,

We have 3 million hits already...

789
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:58,087
UBN is running it like every 3 minutes.

<i> Are they letting people out? </i>

791
01:13:59,614 --> 01:14:01,972
I'm going to talk to FEZA about it, 
right now.

792
01:14:02,534 --> 01:14:03,939
Doesn't matter.

793
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:06,663
At least I don't think it's going to matter.

794
01:14:07,217 --> 01:14:10,308
What? No, listen,
listen, Just hang in there.

795
01:14:10,332 --> 01:14:11,503
We're trapped.

796
01:14:12,408 --> 01:14:14,126
I don't know how much time we have left.

797
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:17,353
Don't you give up on me, Chase.

798
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:20,631
Listen, no matter what happens.

799
01:14:21,906 --> 01:14:23,469
Don't beat yourself up, OK?

800

<i> You're a good friend, Jordan.</i>

801
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:29,645
You bastard, don't
even think about it.

802
01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:34,345
Chase?

803
01:14:35,444 --> 01:14:36,844
Goodbye, Jo.

804
01:14:53,225 --> 01:14:54,499
You want to call someone?

805
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:12,365
Come on, let's go, boys.

806
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:37,883
Who left open the goddamn
zombie room open?

807
01:15:50,596 --> 01:15:52,097
Any last words?

808
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:55,422
You've got to be kidding me.

809
01:15:55,796 --> 01:15:57,315
The drugs don't work.

810
01:15:57,871 --> 01:16:00,943
I mean, I could chain you up there with Larry.

811
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:05,026
- Son of...
- Yeah, I know.

812
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:16,957
Would you can clean up this mess?

813
01:16:17,894 --> 01:16:19,875
I'm sorry, sir, but
I can't confirm that.

814
01:16:19,882 --> 01:16:21,470
Get the hell out of my tent.

815
01:16:22,322 --> 01:16:24,209
My guy is
trapped in your warehouse.

816
01:16:24,233 --> 01:16:25,161
He needs help right away,

817
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,832
Yeah Yeah, screw your guy and his help.

818
01:16:28,903 --> 01:16:30,775
I'm buried under 10 tons of shit...

819
01:16:30,829 --> 01:16:32,223
... you guys stirred up with that video.

820
01:16:32,781 --> 01:16:34,326
They're going kill him,

821
01:16:34,363 --> 01:16:36,617
Yes, and not just him.

822
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,757
Get the hell out. Go.

823
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:41,363
If he dies, I'm coming for you.

824
01:16:59,344 --> 01:17:00,085
Hey!

825
01:17:00,109 --> 01:17:00,995
Don't worry, I'm from the press.

826
01:17:01,019 --> 01:17:01,759
Hey!

827
01:17:03,636 --> 01:17:06,383
<i> - Crystal?
- I don't think we should... </i>

828
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:16,103
This proves that it is safe
to let people out.

829
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:20,027
Okay.

830
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:22,320
But I'm not running this quarantine.

831
01:17:23,254 --> 01:17:24,529
Not yet, anyway.

832
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:28,530
What do we have to do
to get him out?

833
01:17:28,922 --> 01:17:29,953
Personally,

834
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:33,032
I'm more concerned the thousands of
people trapped in there with him.

835
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,505
People that I
have been ordered to kill.

836
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:37,923
What are you suggesting?

837
01:17:38,585 --> 01:17:39,739
Nothing.

838
01:17:40,835 --> 01:17:43,099
- Okay.
- Mind you...

839
01:17:45,379 --> 01:17:47,053
...If I was in charge,

840
01:17:47,505 --> 01:17:50,791
my first order would be to
send in a combat team...

841
01:17:50,822 --> 01:17:52,743
... to rescue that girl
and anyone with her.

842
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,255
Now if you'll excuse me.

843
01:17:57,759 --> 01:17:59,408
I have a press conference.

844
01:18:34,636 --> 01:18:35,443
Shit.

845
01:18:54,968 --> 01:18:56,887
Well, well, well.

01:18:57,844 --> 01:19:00,199

847
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,550

859

You are perfectly aware
the veracity of that video.

860
01:19:52,591 --> 01:19:54,357
You asked for proof, and Chase Carter...

861
01:19:54,381 --> 01:19:55,969
... risked his life
to get you that proof.

a lot of innocent people die,

- My priority...

864

... But you're still knee deep in shit.

872

Tonight we bear witness ...

873

... to the death of a great American city.

874
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:26,517
A city that was your job to save.

875
01:20:27,855 --> 01:20:31,057
Yes, I can think of a lot of words
to describe this situation,

876
01:20:31,317 --> 01:20:34,253
but "success", is not one of them.

877
01:20:42,114 --> 01:20:44,731

Was it airborne?

878
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:57,333

 you can you do this.

889
01:23:05,597 --> 01:23:06,493
Yes.

890
01:23:07,264 --> 01:23:08,647
Come here, stupid zombie.

891
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:10,282
Yes, Are you hungry?

892
01:23:12,686 --> 01:23:13,749
Here you go.

893
01:23:37,905 --> 01:23:39,536
You're ruining it.

894
01:23:40,446 --> 01:23:41,905
Eat him.

895
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,209
<i> The Congress today passed Bill HR251... </i>

896
01:24:19,244 --> 01:24:21,927
<i> ... handing complete control
to the East Mission quarantine ... </i>

897
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,039
<i> ... to the military. </i>

898
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:26,663
<i> Some Congressmen are already 
calling for an investigation... </i>

899
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:29,056
<i> ... into FEZA's embarrassing performance. </i>

900
01:24:33,094 --> 01:24:34,809
We have sent a team to the warehouse.

901
01:24:35,927 --> 01:24:37,601
There's nobody there but zombies.

902
01:24:39,089 --> 01:24:39,852
What?

903
01:24:40,217 --> 01:24:41,414
You did your best.

904
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:43,309
More than most people would.

905
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:45,275
I'm sorry.

906
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:48,057
For what it's worth...

907
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,705
... we're restarting the evacuation.

908
01:24:52,895 --> 01:24:54,562
You have saved a lot of lives.

909
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,560
(No Dialog)

910
01:26:01,696 --> 01:26:02,818
Chase?

911
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,626
Chase! Oh my God!
Where were you?

912
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:09,536
- Are you here?
- I'm at the warehouse.

913
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:11,010
I got out.

914
01:26:11,412 --> 01:26:13,482
At the... 
but they said...

915
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:19,727
Helicopters, did you see any helicopter?

916
01:26:20,215 --> 01:26:22,357
No, I didn't see any helicopter.

917
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:27,356
The army was suppose to go
in there and get you out.

918
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,843
Yeah, well obviously they don't care.

919
01:26:29,425 --> 01:26:32,519
Look, If I can make it to
the wall, can I get out?

920
01:26:32,553 --> 01:26:33,786
Yeah, you can get out.

921
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:38,272
Something is not alright here.

922
01:26:39,268 --> 01:26:41,252
- What isn't?
- Just trust me...

923
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:43,333
When you get here, don't tell anyone 
who you are, you understand?

924
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:46,096
Not you, not that girl.

925
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,571
... You, you've got balls,
I'll give you that.

926
01:27:13,499 --> 01:27:15,298
A man needs
a girl to point...

927
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:16,881
... a gun to his head every once in awhile.

928
01:27:16,905 --> 01:27:19,470
Yeah? Lend me yours and
I can do it again.

929
01:27:24,927 --> 01:27:26,553
This is gonna hurt.

930
01:27:28,177 --> 01:27:29,280
Yes? Good,

931
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:30,846
I like it rough.

932
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:54,244
You know, I saw you on the news.

933
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:57,563
You came in here after
 the wall went up.

934
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:00,921
That takes balls.

935
01:28:02,412 --> 01:28:03,587
There's no law.

936
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:04,935
No order.

937
01:28:06,084 --> 01:28:08,021
The place was practically begging me.

938
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:15,705
And the zombies, don't scare you?

939
01:28:15,802 --> 01:28:17,027
Brother Z?
No.

940
01:28:17,179 --> 01:28:20,339
No, I've got pit bulls that cause me 
more trouble than that.

941
01:28:24,476 --> 01:28:25,644
Help!

942
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:30,005
You think I'm that stupid? 
You think I'm that stupid?

943
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:32,604
You gonna wish I killed you.

944
01:28:33,686 --> 01:28:35,211
Look around.

945
01:28:35,318 --> 01:28:36,806
You're are already dead.

946
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:46,829
Not me.

947
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,988
What, you're gonna blow us all up?

948
01:29:02,797 --> 01:29:04,007
Maybe...

949
01:29:04,296 --> 01:29:05,800
Maybe I will,

950
01:29:06,335 --> 01:29:07,714
or maybe...

951
01:29:07,836 --> 01:29:09,954
I'll just blow up that wall out there.

952
01:29:11,006 --> 01:29:12,706
And that's your plan to get out?

953
01:29:14,303 --> 01:29:16,022
Who said I wanted out?

954
01:29:18,512 --> 01:29:21,261
I'm king of this shit,

955
01:29:22,518 --> 01:29:23,953
Before all this,

956
01:29:23,978 --> 01:29:25,864
I was just a nine to fiver...

957
01:29:25,895 --> 01:29:29,183
... I was trying to
get through the goddamn day.

958
01:29:29,438 --> 01:29:30,952
My life meant nothing.

959
01:29:32,774 --> 01:29:34,605
I was nothing.

960
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:38,670
But now... 
Now?

961
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:43,045
It's a paradise,

962
01:29:44,823 --> 01:29:46,168
But now...

963
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:49,508
... now they want to go, and bomb it.

964
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,780
Right?

965
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:53,976
But...

966
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:58,593
What if it is too
big to bomb?

967
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:01,493
See, it got me thinking.

968
01:30:02,337 --> 01:30:03,977
What if...?

969
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:07,277
Mr. Z out for a walk.

970
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:11,147
Expand his horizons.

971
01:30:11,178 --> 01:30:12,286
But...

972
01:30:12,387 --> 01:30:13,642
See now...

973
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:18,159
The old Z...
old Z can't do it on his own.

974
01:30:18,352 --> 01:30:19,604
No no no no,

975
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:21,027
But me and Z?

976
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:27,252
Me and Z, got what you
call "a mutual interest".

977
01:30:27,276 --> 01:30:30,240
So, no! 
No! No!

978
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:33,072
I don't want out of this shit!

979
01:30:33,154 --> 01:30:36,672
I'm taking this shit with me!

980
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:49,005
Get on your knees...

981
01:30:49,206 --> 01:30:50,357
Now!

982
01:30:56,628 --> 01:30:58,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
01:31:15,518 --> 01:31:16,788
What are you going to do?

984
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:19,050
Huh? What are you going to do?

985
01:31:35,827 --> 01:31:38,178
King of the fucking Zombies!

986
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:44,549
No! No!

987
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,288
No!

988
01:32:05,182 --> 01:32:06,720
Todd get that bitch!

989
01:32:07,518 --> 01:32:10,842
Where are you going? Huh?
Where are you going?

990
01:32:12,726 --> 01:32:14,073
You bitch!

991
01:32:21,528 --> 01:32:22,420
What are you doing?

992
01:32:22,593 --> 01:32:25,972
Oh, no.

993
01:32:25,996 --> 01:32:27,336
- Come on.
- Yes!

994
01:32:45,253 --> 01:32:46,365
No!

995
01:32:46,797 --> 01:32:48,464
What? You're not done
with her yet?

996
01:32:48,756 --> 01:32:51,964
No, I'm not done with her yet.

997
01:32:52,093 --> 01:32:54,589
I'm gonna rip every little piece...

998
01:33:24,663 --> 01:33:26,852
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

999
01:33:34,003 --> 01:33:35,113
Kill her.

1000
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:39,807
Come on.

1001
01:34:50,431 --> 01:34:53,073
Get off!
Get off!

1002
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:54,574
No!

1003
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:05,108
<i> Nooooooo! </i>

1004
01:35:06,943 --> 01:35:08,304
Nice swing.

1005
01:35:08,328 --> 01:35:09,983
Drive, Krabowski.

1006
01:35:19,787 --> 01:35:21,674
<i> As we count down the hours... </i>

1007
01:35:21,698 --> 01:35:25,106
<i> ... for the inevitable, tragic 
firebombing of Mission East... </i>

1008
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:27,071
<i> ...we now join General Lyons... </i>

1009
01:35:27,095 --> 01:35:28,698
<i> ... for this important update. </i>

1010
01:35:28,722 --> 01:35:30,060
For more than a year,

1011
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:31,955
we have worked very closely
 with Phenotrans...

1012
01:35:31,979 --> 01:35:34,592
... to improve how we treat infected people.

1013
01:35:35,086 --> 01:35:37,606
When survivors pass
 through this gate,

1014
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:40,041
we will implant them with these.

1015
01:35:41,011 --> 01:35:43,554
This chip contains year supply...

1016
01:35:43,633 --> 01:35:45,337
... of highly concentrated Zombrex.

1017
01:35:46,476 --> 01:35:48,849
No more daily shots.

1018
01:35:48,852 --> 01:35:50,431
No more human error.

1019
01:35:51,227 --> 01:35:54,051
No more tragedies like this one.

1020
01:35:54,106 --> 01:35:55,971
<i> - Is Phenotrans involved?
- Thank you. </i> 

1021
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:01,774
<i> - You use Zombrex every day? 
- Every day. </i> 

1022
01:36:02,711 --> 01:36:05,788
<i>I want you to take
this and wait over there. </i>

1023
01:36:07,655 --> 01:36:09,221
Get the hell away from me.

1024
01:36:09,245 --> 01:36:10,876
I know you're pissed at
me, and you have every right to be.

1025
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,669
I did what I did to save my friend.

1026
01:36:12,786 --> 01:36:16,156
Oh, you lied on national TV, 
and you cost me my career.

1027
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,562
Why would I be pissed?

1028
01:36:17,663 --> 01:36:19,162
I didn't lie.

1029
01:36:19,367 --> 01:36:21,452
I never sent you to that warehouse.

1030
01:36:21,476 --> 01:36:23,317
You put a note on my car.

1031
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:25,632
No, I didn't.

1032
01:36:26,963 --> 01:36:28,819
Son of a bitch.

1033
01:36:28,921 --> 01:36:30,237
Lyons...

1034
01:36:30,422 --> 01:36:32,012
- He screwed us both.
- Yeah.

1035
01:36:32,047 --> 01:36:33,291
Me, more than you...

1036
01:36:33,315 --> 01:36:35,103
So what the hell is going on?

1037
01:36:35,678 --> 01:36:36,968
Okay, look...

1038
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:39,673
Phenotrans came to us
years ago with these chips.

1039
01:36:39,697 --> 01:36:42,525
It was a civil rights nightmare, 
obviously.

1040
01:36:42,601 --> 01:36:44,915
So we passed.
Now look what's happened.

1041
01:36:44,937 --> 01:36:47,680
The Army has been set up to
take over Homeland Defense.

1042
01:36:47,687 --> 01:36:50,380
Lyons is a frick'in hero.

1043
01:36:50,734 --> 01:36:53,998
and they can put these computer chips
in who ever they feel like.

1044
01:36:58,404 --> 01:36:59,928
How do I fix this?

1045
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:06,181
Okay, look.

1046
01:37:06,284 --> 01:37:09,914
Does your kid have any
other information from the warehouse?

1047
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:12,524
He's got pictures.

1048
01:37:16,248 --> 01:37:17,465
Wait a minute.

1049
01:37:20,671 --> 01:37:21,841
Check it out,

1050
01:37:23,006 --> 01:37:26,149
The Army already had those chips
on their trucks when they arrived.

1051
01:37:28,344 --> 01:37:30,351
That's not even the half of it.

1052
01:37:37,924 --> 01:37:39,024
It's okay.

1053
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,159
Thanks.

1054
01:37:43,186 --> 01:37:44,066
Hey,

1055
01:37:44,438 --> 01:37:47,230
I'm leaving and I just thought
 maybe I could...

1056
01:37:47,254 --> 01:37:49,352
... get some closure on
Chase before I left.

1057
01:37:49,376 --> 01:37:50,714
I'm sorry about him.

1058
01:37:51,823 --> 01:37:52,991
Thanks.

1059
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:56,286
Listen, can  I talk to the
officer who led that mission?

1060
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,818
I think it would make me feel better
 knowing what he saw.

1061
01:38:00,327 --> 01:38:03,012
That off the books mission
I did it as a favor...

1062
01:38:03,952 --> 01:38:05,652
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1063
01:38:06,496 --> 01:38:07,642
I know.

1064
01:38:07,788 --> 01:38:11,975
I'm just trying to make sure
I did everything I could,

1065
01:38:13,041 --> 01:38:15,122
But you said he did make
a difference and I think...

1066
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,357
I think he would
 like that.

1067
01:38:18,007 --> 01:38:20,907
That line of survivors out there
proves that.

1068
01:38:21,591 --> 01:38:23,363
Let me add something personal.

1069
01:38:23,508 --> 01:38:26,507
I came here with orders
to wipe this place out.

1070
01:38:26,764 --> 01:38:28,048
But instead...

1071
01:38:28,556 --> 01:38:29,816
... my boys...

1072
01:38:30,222 --> 01:38:32,556
...are out there handing out blankets!

1073
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,073
And hot meals.

1074
01:38:34,225 --> 01:38:36,912
Every one of them, 
me in particular...

1075
01:38:36,936 --> 01:38:38,095
...owe that to him.

1076
01:38:38,937 --> 01:38:39,968
And you.

1077
01:38:42,899 --> 01:38:46,220
You've had enough time to get 
the new chips here?

1078
01:38:46,434 --> 01:38:48,389
This is the US Army,
 darling.

1079
01:38:48,532 --> 01:38:51,361
When lives are on the line,
we move pretty damn fast.

1080
01:38:52,034 --> 01:38:53,533
That's a welcome change.

1081
01:38:53,535 --> 01:38:56,096
And Phenotrans, they can move up?

1082
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,590
Well, they are not military, 
they're not bad.

1083
01:38:58,957 --> 01:39:00,729
With three or four days warning.

1084
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,222
They get the job done.

1085
01:39:03,498 --> 01:39:04,843
Three or four days?

1086
01:39:08,918 --> 01:39:10,095
Thanks.

1087
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:20,895

01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,966

1090
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:27,406

- This is ridiculous. </i> 

1097

1098

<i> Yeah, I'm sure. </i>

1101
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:47,659

01:39:51,037 --> 01:39:52,347

1106
01:39:52,374 --> 01:39:53,948

1117
01:40:18,438 --> 01:40:20,810
<i> Well, they've called me

1118
01:40:21,034 --> 01:40:22,158
<i> But guess what? </i>

1119
01:40:22,164 --> 01:40:23,420
<i> I'm still here. </i>

1120
01:40:30,173 --> 01:40:33,586
We have Bravo team
guest estimate at one kilometer.

1121
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,386
Make sure we have 
some guys on roofs.

1122
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,787
Okay, we have a lookout
in the northwest corner too.

1123
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:41,908
Hey.

1124
01:40:42,358 --> 01:40:44,899
So, Phenotrans need
three or four days...

1125
01:40:45,362 --> 01:40:46,912
... to get those
chips to the military.

1126
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:50,084
So, how did the bastards have
them when they arrived?

1127
01:40:50,108 --> 01:40:51,347
Exactly.

1128
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:54,510
Wait, your friend
has got the FEZA waybill...

1129
01:40:54,545 --> 01:40:55,718
...straight to the warehouse.

1130
01:40:55,742 --> 01:40:57,330
But no one at FEZA
has heard of him.

1131
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:02,074
Let's see if the military has.

1132
01:41:03,721 --> 01:41:05,286
Norton, 
look at you.

1133
01:41:06,431 --> 01:41:08,217
Yeah, 
show me that waybill.

1134
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,255
Those fuckers!

1135
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:20,903
The shipment came from Fort Carson.

1136
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:22,320
That's General Lyons base.

1137
01:41:24,538 --> 01:41:26,768
Sit tight, The world got to see this.

1138
01:41:30,423 --> 01:41:31,226
Hey, wait...

1139
01:41:33,135 --> 01:41:34,804
No! No! 
Please! Please!

1140
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:36,047
Shit.

1141
01:41:43,522 --> 01:41:45,303
Tear it apart, if you have too.

1142
01:41:45,403 --> 01:41:46,720
Check everywhere.

1143
01:41:57,669 --> 01:41:58,766

<i> the army planted
the bad Zombrex in there. </i>

1145
01:42:02,547 --> 01:42:05,873
So track the label of that case

1146
01:42:05,886 --> 01:42:07,666
If you can't find me,
it will lead to them.

1147
01:42:25,996 --> 01:42:28,408
Halt! Get down! Get down!

1148
01:42:28,501 --> 01:42:29,705
On the ground, now!

1149
01:42:30,048 --> 01:42:31,487
Check her out, check her!

1150
01:42:44,898 --> 01:42:47,258
<i> Leave your vehicle. </i>

1151
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:53,771
<i> Walk towards the wall, slowly. </i>

<i> Keep your hands where 
we can see them. </i>

1153
01:43:02,964 --> 01:43:04,112
They're not going to shoot us?

1154
01:43:05,174 --> 01:43:06,639
No, we're gonna be fine.

1155
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:17,945
Oh, shit.
 Come on!

1156
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:31,464
<i> Turn down the radio. </i>

1157
01:43:33,589 --> 01:43:34,971
I'm sorry, what?

1158
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:38,465
<i> Turn off the radio now! </i>

1159
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:40,334
Okay.

1160
01:43:45,021 --> 01:43:46,817
We need to see those hands.

1161
01:43:48,066 --> 01:43:50,398
<i> Your hands, let me see them. </i>

1162
01:43:53,782 --> 01:43:56,262
<i> Step away from the vehicle. </i>

1163
01:43:56,328 --> 01:43:58,421
- Is everything OK?
- Step away from the vehicle!

1164
01:43:58,526 --> 01:43:59,494
Yeah, Yeah.

1165
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:03,013
<i> Step away from the vehicle, now! </i>

1166
01:44:03,045 --> 01:44:04,370
No problem!

1167
01:44:05,256 --> 01:44:06,653
No problem!

1168
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:24,707
I lost the target!
I can't see!

1169
01:44:30,748 --> 01:44:33,823
Conserve your ammo,
wait for targets.

1170
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,527
Come on, 
boys and girls.

1171
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:05,145
Welcome...

1172

... to the after party,

1173
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:17,373
Is that's a fucking bomb?

1174
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:18,790
Son of a bitch.

1175
01:45:23,899 --> 01:45:24,938
Go.

1176
01:45:45,306 --> 01:45:47,825
<i> - I think I see movement.
- Open fire! </i>

1177
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:26,623
Come on!

1178
01:47:40,842 --> 01:47:41,838
Crystal!

1179
01:48:17,008 --> 01:48:17,860
Bomb!

1180
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:20,186
- Bomb!
- Withdrawal!

1181
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:21,890
Withdrawal! 
Withdrawal!

1182
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:23,211
Clear the area.

1183
01:48:27,484 --> 01:48:29,492
Crystal!
The bomb!

1184
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,910
Go!

1185
01:48:52,562 --> 01:48:53,855
This is gonna hurt!

<i> Public pressure has worked
just as you predicted. </i>

1191
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:13,105
I believe we have help
congress and the press...

1192
01:50:13,418 --> 01:50:15,017
... To better understand 
their priorities, sir,

We are T minus five minutes.

1197
01:50:47,755 --> 01:50:48,627
You okay?

1198
01:50:49,801 --> 01:50:51,547
Yeah, are we done?

1199
01:50:51,552 --> 01:50:52,582
Almost.

1200
01:50:54,852 --> 01:50:56,229
Hey, you mind if I plug this in?

1201
01:50:56,813 --> 01:50:58,174
The battery is low.

1202
01:51:03,237 --> 01:51:06,733
Well, I guess you must
be pretty happy.

1203
01:51:07,492 --> 01:51:09,104
Finally got your big story.

1204
01:51:12,127 --> 01:51:13,670

I'll be right back.

1212
01:51:46,879 --> 01:51:48,296
This will only sting for a moment.

1213
01:51:51,348 --> 01:51:52,331
What?

1214
01:51:56,267 --> 01:51:59,288
And in three, two, one.

1215
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,637

1224
