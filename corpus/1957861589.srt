00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,241
That's great, honey.

183
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,912
I have really good feeling
about this move.

184
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,082
Me too.

185
00:11:59,019 --> 00:11:59,954
Me too.

186
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:10,691
(♪♪♪)

187
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,812
(♪♪♪)

188
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:30,084
[indistinct whisperings]

189
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,620
[screams]

190
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,853
[gasps]

191
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,270
Sweetie, time to get up.

192
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,873
Dammit, Andrew!

193
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,175
Stop taking things
out of the trash!

194
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:59,179
(♪♪♪)

195
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,320
RACHEL: Bye, sweetie.
Have fun at school.

196
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,522
Yeah, right.

197
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,491
She'll come around.

198
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,426
- I hope so.
- I love you.

199
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,194
I love you.

200
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,131
Hey, sweetie, I love you
and I'm sorry that

201
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:17,998
I yelled at you.

202
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,134
She doesn't like the dark.

203
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,001
What?

204
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,303
APRIL:
Would you hurry up!

205
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,337
Bye, mom.

206
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,311
You know the difference between
a city boy and a country boy?

207
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,780
No.

208
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,381
A city boy walks up
and sticks it in.

209
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,818
Whereas a country boy
sticks it in and walks up.

210
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,422
[laughing]

211
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:42,489
That's not funny.

212
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,490
Then why are you laughing?

213
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,594
Okay, it's a little funny.

214
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:47,861
But it's certainly
not appropriate.

215
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,564
Oh, it ain't known
to be appropriate.

216
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,333
You got any plans tonight?

217
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,969
Other than watching
American Idol reruns?

218
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,171
Nope.

219
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,807
Why don't you and your wife
come over for dinner?

220
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,240
Rachel needs to meet
some women here and

221
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,409
give you a chance
to see the house.

222
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,977
Sounds good to me.

223
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,588
- Hello.
- ERIC: <i>Hey, babe.</i>

224
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,389
Hi, um...

225
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,990
ERIC: <i>Look, I invited a friend
and his wife to dinner tonight.</i>

226
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,527
RACHEL:
Yeah. Um, the house is a mess.

227
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,695
ERIC:
<i>No, the house is fine.</i>

228
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,262
And you know, I have
my doctor's appointment

229
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,298
- this afternoon.
- ERIC: <i>It'll be fine.</i>

230
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,333
<i>- Alright, we need to meet new people.</i>
- Yeah.

231
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,570
I can... I can pull something
together, no problem.

232
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,539
- ERIC: <i>Okay.</i>
- Just honey, a little more notice next time.

233
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:32,607
ERIC:
<i>Okay, babe, sure.</i>

234
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,509
Okay, thanks.

235
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:35,577
Alright, I love you.

236
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,910
ERIC:
<i>Love you.</i>

237
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:40,948
Great.

238
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:51,518
(♪♪♪)

239
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:03,337
Rachel, what brings you
to Savannah?

240
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,707
We were looking for
a fresh start.

241
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,742
So, when my husband
was offered a job here,

242
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,511
we thought "Why not?"

243
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:14,415
Fresh start usually has more
to do with you as a person

244
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,983
than where you're living.

245
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:18,952
I suppose.

246
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:26,528
We suffered a tragedy
in our old home.

247
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:32,032
And it just reached a point
where I...

248
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,601
I couldn't stay there any
longer.

249
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,470
What was the tragedy?

250
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,307
We lost our little girl.

251
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,143
I'm so sorry to hear that.

252
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,648
We have...

253
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,619
We had twins, Andrew and Alice.

254
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,524
She had just turned 7
when it happened.

255
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:01,696
Loss of a child
is a devastating event.

256
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,263
How is your family coping?

257
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,333
The last six months have been
really,

258
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,704
really hard.

259
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:12,139
Everything changed
after she died.

260
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,742
It's understandable.

261
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,011
How have things been
since the move?

262
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,281
Better.

263
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:23,685
Things seem better.

264
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,988
JAMES: Rachel, listen,
I don't care what Eric

265
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,725
says about you,
you are a great cook.

266
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,662
[laughing]

267
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:35,996
VANESSA:
Yeah.

268
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,532
Do you have any idea
how hard it is being married

269
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:38,766
to a comedian?

270
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,334
A bad one at that.

271
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,069
Oh, burn.

272
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,874
Well, I think you are
a very lucky woman, Vanessa.

273
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:48,141
JAMES: Huh? Now,
you hear that, babe?

274
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,777
She said, you basically
hit the lottery

275
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,913
when you caught me.

276
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,313
- Caught you?
- Yeah.

277
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,416
Um, as I recall, you chased me
down for three months

278
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,887
before I finally decided
to go out on a date with you.

279
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,622
- Some details.
- [James chuckles]

280
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,725
So Vanessa, James says
you have a very colorful family.

281
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,860
Oh yeah, uh well, they're black.

282
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,094
[Eric chuckles]

283
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,262
I didn't mean that,
that's not what I meant.

284
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,163
I'm kidding, man.
[James laughs]

285
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:13,166
Well, my family was brought here
from West Africa.

286
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,036
And damn good recipes
for black-eyed peas

287
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,705
ain't the only thing
they carried with 'em.

288
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:18,973
What do you mean?

289
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,141
Oh, they brought
their ancient African religion.

290
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,811
Really?
Oh yes. And it is still here.

291
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,146
My grandmother,
she's a Hoodoo priestess.

292
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,115
She has what they call,
"the shine".

293
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,019
The shine?

294
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,153
That crazy old woman thinks
she sees things.

295
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,023
Like things that ain't there.

296
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,391
It's true. She can see
into the spirit world.

297
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,560
Okay.

298
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,761
That's cool.

299
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,796
You don't... you don't...
You don't believe that stuff,

300
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,031
though, right?

301
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,899
I don't believe it, I know it.

302
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,333
Vanessa, babe, don't start.

303
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,334
He asked.

304
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,870
Okay, yeah, 'cause she think
she got them

305
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,337
magical powers, too.

306
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,139
VANESSA: Okay,
they're not magical powers.

307
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,543
I'm just more spiritual.

308
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,845
So, I can sense things.

309
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,414
Not like my grandmother,
but little things.

310
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:02,684
Like what?

311
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:05,520
Well, that's hard to describe.

312
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,255
Um, you know, how sometimes
you think you might see

313
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,390
something move
out of the corner of your eye?

314
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,661
- I guess.
- Sure, yeah.

315
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:17,532
Well, my grandmother taught me
to look at it.

316
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,166
To actually see it.

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,972
You know how some men say that
their wives are crazy.

318
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:25,006
Mine's is like actually crazy,
like actually.

319
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,241
[James laughs]

320
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,510
RACHEL:
No, I don't think it's crazy.

321
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:32,714
I actually think
it's kind of beautiful.

322
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,350
Oh my God!

323
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,652
- RACHEL: Oh.
- ERIC: Oh, buddy.

324
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:39,020
RACHEL:
Oh.

325
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,788
Come here, here.

326
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,190
Come on.
Okay, sweetie, come on.

327
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,095
Are you feeling better?

328
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,363
You made her angry, mama.

329
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,232
Who, baby?

330
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,668
How are you doing, sport?

331
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:55,369
I'm okay, dad.

332
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,904
- You up for dessert?
- Yes, sir.

333
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,405
Alright.

334
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,614
Thanks you for coming over.

335
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:07,982
Absolutely, man.

336
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:09,383
Vanessa, it's a pleasure.

337
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,387
Eric,

338
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,924
stay out of the basement.

339
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,893
There is a darkness there,
I can feel it.

340
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:21,996
I think you heard
too many ghost stories.

341
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:24,032
I mean, we don't even have
a basement.

342
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,867
Yeah, babe, let's save
the Voodoo talk

343
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,036
for your superstitious
girlfriends.

344
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:30,038
Yeah, sorry.

345
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,305
No worries.
Have a good night.

346
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,407
You too.

347
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,111
I don't wanna come back here.

348
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:45,210
(♪♪♪)

349
00:19:55,228 --> 00:20:03,228

353
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,272
RACHEL: Are you sure
you don't want to come?

354
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,241
There's so much to see here.

355
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,844
It'll be fun.

356
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,244
No thanks.

357
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,148
I'm gonna read my book
and pretend I'm back home.

358
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,717
April, this is home now.

359
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:50,952
Uh-huh.

360

RACHEL:
There's not much we can do.

362
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,862
You can pray for her soul.

00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,898

00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,210
LILATH:
I'm Lilath.

369
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,613
I live around here,
so I thought I'd say hi.

370
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:21,749
Uh, hi.

371
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:22,884
I'm April.

372
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:25,352
Room for me?

373
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:29,456
Um, uh, sure.

I am so glad you moved in.

376
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,731
It gets lonely here.

377
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,432
Tell me about it.

378
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:44,471
Well, no more being lonely.

379
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:49,677
[indistinct chatter]

380
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:01,222
Hey, I'm gonna get us
a surprise, okay?

381
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,124
So hang here with mom,
I'll be right back.

382
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,324
- Oh.
- Okay.

383
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:10,998
Hey.

384
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,036
Remember what you said
in the car about praying?

385
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,604
Uh-huh.

386
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,639
You know we're not really
the kind of family that does

387
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:22,243
the whole God
and religion thing, right?

388
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,979
I know.
That's part of the problem.

389
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,182
What?

390
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,319
If someone dies
and their soul is broken,

391
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:33,187
they don't get to go to heaven.

392
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,623
They have to go
to the dark place.

393
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,124
Hey, sweetie,

394
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,427
I don't know where
you're hearing this stuff,

395
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:44,098
but it's not true.

396
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,801
Yes, it is.
You know it is.

397
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,704
There is no dark place.

398
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,808
And when someone dies,
and none of us have to worry

399
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:57,979
about that for
a very, very long time.

400
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,651
But when they do,
they just go to sleep.

401
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,687
But sometimes they wake up.

402
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,489
ERIC:
Surprise!

403
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,192
Damn it, Eric!
You scared me.

404
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,194
I'm sorry, babe.

405
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:14,328
This make up for it?

406
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,263
Cotton candy!

407
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:16,463
Yeah.

408
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:18,465
Come on,
there's a lot more to see.

409
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:25,640
You should relax a little.

410
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,576
I am relaxed.

411
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,747
It's such a pretty day.

412
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:39,220
You should feel the sun
on your skin.

Uh, my folks are home.

423
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,202
I should probably be going.

424
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,504
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

I don't go to school.

- Damn it, Vanessa.

442
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,904
I told you don't come up
on the job like this.

443
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:13,174
- Hey, what's up?
- I spoke to my grandmother about your house last night.

444
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,544
Yeah.

445
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,044
VANESSA:
Eric, you need to be careful.

446
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:19,613
Careful about what?

447
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,149
She told me the history
on your house.

448
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,684
It is not good, Eric.

449
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,486
What are you talking about?

450
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,422
She said your house was built
over a foundation

451
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,224
of an old plantation home
that burned down

452
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:31,592
during the Civil War.

453
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:34,028
Okay.

454
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:36,397
Former slaves, they passed down
stories about

455
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:37,731
the terrible things
that happened

456
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:39,534
down in that basement to them.

457
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,635
Unspeakable things.

458
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,003
I mean, thank you
for the history lesson,

459
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,972
I just don't see
how this affects me.

460
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,440
The slaves revolted.

461
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,609
They locked the family
in the basement.

462
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,778
And then
they burned down the house.

463
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,481
There are very evil forces
at work in your home.

464
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:56,350
You and your family
are not safe.

465
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,186

this is all a little ridiculous.

Alright. You're right.
I'm leaving.

I hope so.

476
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:55,976
That's not true.

Do not take this thing
out of the trash again.

482
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:11,992
Go to bed.

483
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,465

- ERIC: Hey, you okay?

[panting]

728
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:10,785
What were you thinking?

729
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:12,953
You should never go outside
at night.

730
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:14,789
Never!
[sobs]

731
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:16,658
You know how dangerous
the pool is!

732
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:18,125
You could have drowned!

733
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:19,594
- ERIC: That's enough.
- No, but he would have...

734
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:21,195
He's heard enough, Rachel!

735
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:24,998
[sobbing]

736
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,501
You really scared us.

737
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:29,236
Now you gotta promise you're
never gonna do that again.

738
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,539
Pinky?

739
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,142
Alright, go get some sleep.

740
00:49:38,513 --> 00:49:39,581
Come here, come here.

741
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:43,417
[sobbing]

742
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:44,451
Hey.

743
00:49:47,354 --> 00:49:49,824
I... I haven't been so scared
since...

744
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:52,426
Hey, hey, it's alright.

745
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:53,494
Alright?

746
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:58,131
I know tonight was scary,
but Andrew's fine.

747
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,469
I'll put some childproof locks
on all the doors.

748
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,505
Right?

749
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:06,173
Okay, come here, come here.

750
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:08,543
Come here.

751
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:13,013
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

752
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:15,349
I think you made her angry.

753
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:19,419
Who, baby?

754
00:50:19,521 --> 00:50:20,755
You know who.

755
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:30,364
Things don't feel right
in this house.

756
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:32,967
Rachel...

757
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:35,202
It doesn't feel safe.

758
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:41,074
I know tonight scared you, but...

759
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:43,310
I think I want the pool
filled in.

760
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,114
Do you know how much value
that brings to the house?

761
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:49,651
I don't care. I want it gone.

762
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:51,653
Okay,

763
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:54,689
okay.

764
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:56,456
If it makes you feel better,
I'll get somebody here

765
00:50:56,558 --> 00:50:58,325
as soon as I can.

766
00:50:58,425 --> 00:50:59,426
Alright?

767
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:04,464
The sooner the better.

768
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,668

[sighs]

772
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:42,169
Mom's been really off lately.

773
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:45,873
She's just tired. That's all.

774
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,212
I don't wanna go through
what we went through before.

775
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:02,657
Me neither, baby.
Me neither.

<i>That's not true.</i>

ALICE:
<i>They want you to be all alone.</i>

ANDREW:
<i>Stop saying that!</i>

781

<i>Your mother doesn't love you.</i>

ANDREW:
<i>Stop it!</i>

783
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:32,787
ALICE:
<i>She is not a good mother.</i>

784
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,322
<i>You should come live with us.</i>

785
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,290
ANDREW:
<i>I don't want to.</i>

<i>But it's so nice down there.</i>

ALICE:
<i>It's your fault.</i>

792
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:03,417
<i>You did this.</i>

[gasping]

794
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:07,789

You killed me.

[gasping]

796
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:13,628
Excuse me a second, guys.

797
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:17,464
Hey, honey.

798
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:19,399
I'm in the middle
of an important meeting.

799
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,070
Eric, I need you to come home.
Now.

800
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:23,638
ERIC:
<i>Okay what... what's wrong?</i>

801
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,205
I can't stay here.

802
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,440
This place is...

803
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,475
Hey, calm down.
What's going on?

804
00:53:28,576 --> 00:53:30,578
I have something to show you.

805
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:33,480
Something I can't explain.

806
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:35,282
Okay, listen, I'll be home
as soon as I can, alright.

807
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,984
But I have to finish this up.

808
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:38,285
Never mind!

809
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:40,955
[indistinct chatter in distance]

810
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,793
I know this is going
to sound crazy,

811
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:49,764
but I think I'm being haunted
by Alice.

812
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:55,103
You don't really believe that,
do you?

813
00:53:55,203 --> 00:53:57,404
I keep seeing things
and hearing things

814
00:53:58,271 --> 00:53:59,774
I can't explain.

815
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:00,908
Scary things.

816
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:05,378
These are just manifestations
of grief.

817
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:08,415
No, no, doctor,
I... I have proof.

818
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:11,485
Listen to this.

819
00:54:14,155 --> 00:54:15,957
ANDREW:
<i>That's not true.</i>

820
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,059
<i>Stop saying that.</i>

821
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,493
<i>I don't want to.</i>

822
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:22,262
ERIC:
<i>Andrew, time for breakfast.</i>

823
00:54:22,295 --> 00:54:24,364
ANDREW:
<i>I have to go.</i>

824
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:26,868
That sounds like a young man
with a vivid imagination.

825
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:30,071
No, I don't...
I don't understand.

826
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:31,939
I... I... I heard it.

827
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:34,242
It was a little girl's voice.

828
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:36,043
She was talking to my son.

829
00:54:37,678 --> 00:54:40,548
Sometimes our minds
make up things that

830
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:42,282
we want to hear.

831
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:44,552
No, that's not what's happening.

832
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:46,854
I... I don't wanna hear anything.

833
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:50,224
What you're seeing and hearing
is your subconscious

834
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:52,894
trying to deal with your grief.

835
00:54:52,994 --> 00:54:54,796
But it all seemed so real.

836
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,497
It's completely normal.

837
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,203
Tell me, what have you
and your family done

838
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,038
to come to terms
with your daughter's death?

839
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:07,008
Nothing, really.

840
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:10,678
We just pretend like
it never happened.

841
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:12,079
DR. LIVINGSTON:
That's not healthy.

842
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,516
Embrace that your daughter
was a part of your life.

843
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,021
Do you still have
some of her things?

844
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:25,593
Yeah, but they're all
packed away.

845
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:27,895
Create a special place
where the family

846
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,597
can remember Alice.

847
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,833
Put some of her things there.

848
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:34,401
Think of it as a memorial
to her life.

849
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:37,538
Okay.

850
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:40,473
In the meantime, I'm going to
write you a prescription

851
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:44,745
for some medicine that
will help alleviate any anxiety

852
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:45,980
that you may be feeling.

853
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:49,116
Okay, thank you.

Can I come in?

856
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:07,969
Yeah, but you have to be quiet.

857
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:10,304
What are you doing here?

858
00:56:10,403 --> 00:56:11,706
I wanted to see you.

00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,480
I don't want to play anymore.

No, really, I'm serious.

862
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,624
No, I don't want to play
with them either.

863
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:32,093
Just leave me alone.

- Gross.

- Yeah.
- I think it's delicious and then my other favorite.

867
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:48,743
Do you guys like
dairy-free things?

868
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:51,178
- Yes.
- Like, you know how there's like almond milk, oat...

00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:15,803
Turn around and look at me.

00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:56,610
Um, may I help you?

876
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:00,147
I'm Josephine Williams.

877
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,615
Vanessa Williams' grandmother.

878
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:04,151
We need to talk.

879
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:08,756
I fear for your safety.
Your family's safety.

880
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:14,528
Mrs. Williams, what exactly
are you talking about?

881
00:58:14,628 --> 00:58:16,430
Savannah has a history
you can read about

882
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,865
in the textbooks.

883
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:21,035
But there's another history
most folks ain't privy to.

884
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:25,673
A dangerous,
otherworldly history.

885
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:31,746
Voodoo, magic, demons.

886
00:58:36,217 --> 00:58:38,786
JOSEPHINE: Only a
select few know the truth.

887
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:44,892
I'm sorry, but why exactly
are you telling me this.

888
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,563
I heard stories about this piece
of land

889
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:51,032
when I was a little girl.

890
00:58:52,733 --> 00:58:54,835
I was told never to come here.

891
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:01,042
You're starting to scare me.

892
00:59:01,142 --> 00:59:02,376
JOSEPHINE:
Good.

893
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:03,944
You should be scared.

894
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,115
Long before this house
stood here,

895
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:11,585
there was another house.

896
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:14,555
A slave owning house.

897
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,758
My great granddaddy
worked the fields

898
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:19,260
that used to grow outside.

899
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:25,132
He and the other slaves
heard rumors about

900
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:26,267
what was under here.

901
00:59:29,804 --> 00:59:31,772
What are you talking about?

902
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:35,109
You've seen things, haven't you?

903
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:38,579
Dark things.

904
00:59:42,149 --> 00:59:43,818
I know you have.

01:37:48,302 --> 01:37:51,338
If you tie me up and fuck me
in your basement.

1436
01:37:51,438 --> 01:37:55,342
(♪♪♪)

1437
01:37:56,544 --> 01:38:00,515
I have so enjoyed playing
with you and your family.

1438

(♪♪♪)

1439
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,555
I can't decide
who tasted better.

1440
01:38:09,056 --> 01:38:11,693
You or your daughter.

1441
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:15,129

1442

[grunting]

1443
01:38:18,932 --> 01:38:21,368
I'm always so wet around you.

1444
01:38:21,468 --> 01:38:25,372
(♪♪♪)

1445
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:32,514
Mommy's so fragile,
you shouldn't do bad things

1446
01:38:32,614 --> 01:38:33,581
behind her back.

1447
01:38:36,383 --> 01:38:40,320

[grunting]

1452
01:39:06,848 --> 01:39:08,850
Time for you to pay
for what you've done.

1453
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:11,485
[choking]

1454
01:39:11,586 --> 01:39:15,489

(♪♪♪)

1463
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:26,528
Rachel, I can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

1464
01:40:28,663 --> 01:40:29,764
I'm on your side,

1465
01:40:29,864 --> 01:40:33,367
but I need to understand
why you did what you did.

1466
01:40:33,467 --> 01:40:36,103
[humming]

1467
01:40:36,203 --> 01:40:37,972
DR. LIVINGSTON: What did
you do with their bodies, Rachel?

1468
01:40:38,071 --> 01:40:42,175
(♪♪♪)

1469
01:40:44,444 --> 01:40:45,980
DR. LIVINGSTON: Where did
you put their bodies, Rachel?

01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:50,183
(♪♪♪)

1471
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,288
DR. LIVINGSTON:
Okay.

1472
01:40:55,355 --> 01:40:57,457
We'll talk again tomorrow.

1473
01:40:57,559 --> 01:41:00,728
[continues humming]

1474
01:41:00,828 --> 01:41:08,828
(♪♪♪)

1475
01:41:14,509 --> 01:41:17,377
And I woke up at 2:30
in the morning to the sound

1476
01:41:17,477 --> 01:41:21,448
of a young girl
whispering my name

1477
01:41:21,549 --> 01:41:22,717
outside the window.

1478
01:41:24,384 --> 01:41:28,422
WILLIAM: And I... I was lying
there and my whole body went cold

1479
01:41:28,523 --> 01:41:32,492
and she just said my name
over, and over, and over.

1480
01:41:33,695 --> 01:41:36,330
I laid there for few minutes and
she said my name over and over.

1481
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:40,367
And finally I... I... I sat up
and I walked out of the room.

1482
01:41:42,169 --> 01:41:45,773
And as I was leaving,
I literally heard her calling me

1483
01:41:45,873 --> 01:41:47,842
all the way out of the room

1484
01:41:47,942 --> 01:41:49,644
And I have never slept
up there again.

1485
01:41:51,045 --> 01:41:53,548
I would see a shadowy figure.

1486
01:41:54,849 --> 01:41:57,417
Almost shaped like a person,

1487
01:41:57,518 --> 01:41:59,687
but I couldn't tell
if it was a man or a woman.

1488
01:41:59,787 --> 01:42:02,090
You could still see the light
from outside,

1489
01:42:02,189 --> 01:42:04,424
streetlights, moonlight,
that kind of thing

1490
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:06,561
coming through
the entire window.

1491
01:42:06,661 --> 01:42:08,228
Except in this area.

1492
01:42:08,328 --> 01:42:10,364
It was always seemed to be
just waiting on the other side

1493
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:11,633
of the door.

1494
01:42:11,733 --> 01:42:14,902
I never felt safe with it
on the other side of the door.

1495
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:17,105
I always felt like
it was just waiting

1496
01:42:17,204 --> 01:42:20,440
on an opportunity to come in.

1497
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:22,944
You hear 'em walking up steps
and you can always hear

1498
01:42:23,044 --> 01:42:24,244
when somebody takes
that last step

1499
01:42:24,344 --> 01:42:26,146
onto top flat floor.

1500
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:28,983
But they always stop
at that top step for a while.

1501
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:31,085
You always hear 'em
walking up steps,

1502
01:42:31,184 --> 01:42:33,087
then they would stop.

1503
01:42:33,186 --> 01:42:36,858
Then it got to where
now you hear 'em walking around,

1504
01:42:38,026 --> 01:42:39,894
like they're going
through the doors,

1505
01:42:39,994 --> 01:42:42,997
but when you come and check,
there's no one ever here.

1506
01:42:43,097 --> 01:42:44,899
It... it jilted me up,
because I felt like

1507
01:42:44,999 --> 01:42:48,069
someone was there staring at me
in the corner of the room.

1508
01:42:48,168 --> 01:42:51,973
I can just feel something
right in front of me

1509
01:42:52,073 --> 01:42:53,608
at the end of my bed.

1510
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:57,411
I watched all of the bed
comforter sheets, everything,

1511
01:42:57,512 --> 01:43:00,948
just dropped down around my feet
and my ankles.

1512
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:02,817
And then it comes up
right to my bedside

1513
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:06,854
and it screamed at me so loud
piercing right next to my face.

1514
01:43:09,157 --> 01:43:10,925
I'd never seen anything
like that in my life.

1515
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,295
And it was after that
that we... we... you know,

1516
01:43:15,395 --> 01:43:16,898
we called a medium
and we started talking

1517
01:43:16,998 --> 01:43:18,866
to exorcists and trying to
figure out what to do,

1518
01:43:18,966 --> 01:43:21,501
because Mark lives
in this house.

1519
01:43:21,602 --> 01:43:23,203
His you know, family's
lived in this house.

1520
01:43:23,303 --> 01:43:25,807
And I don't want anyone
in danger.

1521
01:43:25,907 --> 01:43:29,844
So, when I came to this house
uh, to do a cleansing,

1522
01:43:31,012 --> 01:43:33,915
about 2 miles before
I even got here,

1523
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,217
I was completely overwhelmed.

1524
01:43:37,317 --> 01:43:41,288
The energy was so heavy,
it was a very scary feeling.

1525
01:43:42,322 --> 01:43:44,224
And then I went up to the door,

1526
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:45,693
and I didn't wanna
walk through it.

1527
01:43:45,793 --> 01:43:49,897
I honestly, I honestly
just wanted to jump in my car

1528
01:43:49,997 --> 01:43:50,998
and get the heck outta there.

1529
01:43:51,099 --> 01:43:53,134
It was that disturbing.

1530
01:43:53,233 --> 01:43:54,669
There's something out there
that can hurt us

1531
01:43:54,769 --> 01:43:56,571
that is invisible.

1532
01:43:56,671 --> 01:43:59,207
There's something out there
that can hurt us

1533
01:43:59,306 --> 01:44:02,577
that we cannot defend against.

1534
01:44:02,677 --> 01:44:06,814
So if the question is
how powerful can they become?

1535
01:44:08,415 --> 01:44:09,717
There probably isn't a limit.

1536
01:44:09,817 --> 01:44:13,420
And then you're dealing with
the strongest, fiercest,

1537
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:17,257
most determined entity
in the area.

1538
01:44:17,357 --> 01:44:25,357
