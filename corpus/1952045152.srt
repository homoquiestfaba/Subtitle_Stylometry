Eric is coming back.

00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:37,165
True love they say comes
only once in a lifetime.

00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:39,871
What they don't tell you...

5
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:44,773
...is that sometimes,
you wait a lifetime for love.

6
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:07,007
Some said it contained gold,
but I knew better.

7
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,726
My Uncle said it was cursed,
but his mind was small.

8
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,132
A locked trunk he
said meant secrets.

9
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:17,698
And those who had secrets
could never find a home.

10
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,813
I didn't know if what
he said was true...

11
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,338
...but it was true
enough for me.

12
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:25,450
Something for the journey.

13
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,148
And I suppose I'll have no dinner.

14

Don't let him take it from you.

no one you understand?

I've never really
known a home.

20
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,976
My father was often gone,
my mother was a mystery.

21
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:57,163
The trunk and
I were companions

22

moved easily from
place to place.

23
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,754
Every time he left,
my father told me

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,721
that what he was
leaving behind

25
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:07,054
was the most precious
thing in the world.

26
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,828
Perhaps he spoke of me.

27
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:14,731
They called him the Captain.

28

The remnant of a title
from a forgotten past.

29
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,756
He'd given up the seas
for the desert highways.

30
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,342
For what some said;
was a delusional journey

31
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,310
for lost Civil War gold.

32
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,413
The gold had been entrusted to the care

33
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,147
of my Great-Grandfather.

34
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:32,412
The treasure meant for
the glory of the South.

When the war ended...

36
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,656

it his "inheritance."

...but I would stay
with the trunk.

41

My father always
came back to it.

42
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:17,323

the bitter spoils of war.

00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,868
And there's at bus at 7:30.

182
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,435
Won't be no trouble.

183
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,870
Wait a minute.
What about my ranch?

184
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:44,676
You didn't tell him?

185
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:45,942
Tell me what?

186
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:49,213
Your Aunt Christine owes
$175,000 in back taxes.

187
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,181
If the taxes don't get paid...

188
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,250
The "law" is
giving us 30 days.

189
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,752
And if we don't come
up with the money...

190
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,789
...well, let's just say it's
going to be a little crowded

191
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,155
sleeping in the truck.

192
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,942
Now I ain't got
nothing to do with it.

193
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,636
The property goes to foreclosure auction

194
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,260
if somebody doesn't
make the payment.

195
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,991
And you were hoping my dad
would come up with the money?

196
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,550
They were just trying
to save the ranch.

197
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,535
How much is this
place worth anyways?

198
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,005
I mean, if we can
clear $175,000

199
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,874
I can keep the rest, right?

200
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,674
Well, strictly speaking...

201
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,409
You don't really own the ranch.

202
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:23,574
On account of Aunt
Christine isn't dead yet!

203
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,015
So, who sent out the
letter saying I was dead?

204
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,409
It wasn't a bad idea.

205
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:37,360
Not if he had $175,000.

206
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,397
Yeah well, I'll be gone
first thing in the morning.

207
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,797
We could use
the Captain's gold.

208
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,825
Sam Dalton, you've
got pig spit for brains.

209
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,106
C'mon Christine,
let's get you back to bed.

210
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,758
Just 'cause you
haven't seen it

211
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,468
doesn't mean it don't exist.

212
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,274
If we could find the chest...

213
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,011
Sam, Honey,
I haven't seen it...

214
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:57,947
You haven't seen it...
ain't nobody ever seen it!

215
00:16:58,282 --> 00:16:59,649
C'mon Honey.

216
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,845
I know where my room is.

217
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,621
I was just trying to help.

218
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:25,025
So where are you going?

219
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,377
What does it matter?

220
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,577
It doesn't.

221
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:28,746
Then I could be
going anywhere.

222
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,081
What difference does it make?

223
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,347
I wondered what kind of person

224
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,151
walks out on his
only living relative.

225
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,450
You've got to be kidding me!

226
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,419
You lied to me to
get me out here.

227
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,856
And you wrote me a letter
saying my Aunt was dead!

228
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,858
It could be true... soon enough.

229
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,325
That old buzzard?

230
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,328
She's going to live
till she's a hundred

231
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:46,363
You saw her on a good day.

232
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,866
Some days it ain't so good.

233
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:52,336
So you're still going to leave?

234
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,688
Nothing to keep me here.

235
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,006
What about the gold?

236
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,672
What about it?

237
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,876
What is it? Some kind of
buried treasure or something?

238
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,844
Yeah, something like that.

239
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,414
And you really think it's real?

240
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,751
Aunt Christine, we
need his help.

241
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,719
We gotta cut him in.

242
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,244
Fine.

243
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,457
How much?

244
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,460
50 percent.

245
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:17,794
Done.

246
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:20,531
Aunt Christine!
You already promised me 50 percent.

247
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,366
And with your
50 percent and his...

248
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,334
Well, it just don't add up.

249
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,766
Let's find it first,
we'll fight over it later.

250
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,438
How much is there?

251
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,006
Why should I give you a nickel?

252
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,310
Because I'm your only
living relative, that's why.

253
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,579
And I haven't decided if
I'm going to claim you yet.

254
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,748
Fine, I'll just wait till you're dead.

255
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,848
Yeah, and I'll give it all to charity.

256
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:40,908
Look Ma'am, I didn't really
ask to be a part of all this.

257
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,852
Why are you here?

258
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,389
[Wind blows]

259
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:49,325
[SEA WHISTLE & BELL]

260
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,875
Be careful child.

261
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,572
He's not what he seems.

262
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,614
Aunt Christine, what
did you mean?

263
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,156
You said, "be careful, he's
not what he seems."

264
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,420
Who isn't what he seems?

265
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:22,893
What were you looking at?

266
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:24,895
Can you tell us?

267
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,563
I don't remember.

268
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,364
She's a loony toon.

269
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,535
You coming, or are you just
going to stand there and yap?

270
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,537
You're not actually
going out there are you?

271
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,505
Are you always planning
on being this difficult?

272
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,507
Cause if you are...
I want a new partner.

273
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,943
Sam wait, whoa! She's crazy!

274
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,910
You said so yourself.

275
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,505
Look J.T., I didn't want to
say anything, but I have proof.

276
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:46,651
You mean like actual, tangible,
poke-you-in-the-eye proof?

277
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,586
Actual, tangible,
poke-you-in-the-eye proof.

278
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,371
Well let's see it.

279
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,122
Alright, come with me.

280
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:57,354
J. T: Now I know I'm
related to Aunt Christine.

281
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,962
Sam: How's that?

282
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:01,965
J. T: We're both crazy!

283
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,141
So what happens if we get lost?

284
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,676
That's impossible.

285
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,608
How come?

286
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,879
All you have to do, is keep
rowing till you reach land.

287
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,846
Then you start walking.

288
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,543
You're bound to find
something within a week or two.

289
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,838
You ever been here before?

290
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,538
Lots of times.

291
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,541
How many times is
"lots of times?"

292
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,544
Twice.

293
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,254
There you go!

294
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,788
Where I go?

295
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:01,225
Poke-you-in-the-eye proof.
It's the camp.

296
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,625
What camp?

297
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,962
The camp she was brought to
when she came to the island.

298
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,129
Oh come on! This
doesn't prove anything.

299
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:09,867
I mean this thing's been
here for like a jillion years.

300
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,269
It could be anyone's.
It could be...

301
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,202
...some old
sheepherder's camp.

302
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,639
Uh' huh, and how
would they get here?

303
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,404
Who?

304
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,573
The sheep?

305
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,673
What sheep?

306
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,644
You said it was an
old sheepherders cabin.

307
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,646
How would he
get the sheep here?

308
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,845
It's an island!

309
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,315
You know you're not
working very hard

310
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,715
for your 50 percent
of the fortune.

311
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,651
You know, 50 percent of
nothing is still nothing.

312
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,129
So what are we looking for?

313
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,097
Some kind of clue.

314
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,730
I'm going to go... see what
I can find down here.

315
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,688
Sam, I found something!

316
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,234
Wow, a hinge.

317
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,502
What do you think?

318
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:22,073
What makes you think a
hinge would be important?

319
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,639
We need a real clue.

320
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,625
What, like a treasure map?

321
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,577
A map, a sign, something.

322
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,847
What is it?

323
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,104
Is this yours?

324
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,989
Of course not.

325
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,725
Maybe it belongs
to your sheepherder.

326
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:45,062
Maybe.

327
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,964
What's this?

328
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,301
I don't know, a box?

329
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,340
What do you think this is?

330
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,009
Do you think
it's worth anything?

331
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,609
Let's go.

332
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:01,644
Where are we going?

333
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,147
We gotta go
show Aunt Christine.

334
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,281
Where's Aunt Christine?

335
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:08,114
In her room I'm sure.

336
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,951
How do you like
that Key Lime pie?

337
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:13,789
What are you doing?

338
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,792
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

339
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:18,127
Who's the beau?

340
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,756
That's J.T. Swinton,
he's Christine's nephew.

341
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:24,459
So? What're y'all doing?

342
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,866
Now Sam, that's really not
any of your business, is it?

343
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:30,139
If it was, and it ain't...
I would tell you

344
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:34,110
I invited Turner over for a
piece of my Key Lime pie.

345
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,045
Hmmm!

346
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,446
You don't make pie.

347
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:40,041
As I said, that's really not any
of your business, now is it?

348
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:43,518
Why don't you kids run
outside and play.

349
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,592
Delicious!

350
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,565
It's a sextant.

351
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:00,035
It's an instrument used
to navigate the ocean.

352
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:02,806
Why was it on the island?

353
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:05,475
You found that on the island?

354
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,179
Did you find the window?

355
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,378
What window?

356
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,213
The window in the rock.
That's where Eric and I -

357
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:15,013
Whoa, whoa! How can there
be a window in a rock?

358
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,453
Who's Eric?

359
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:20,787
Aunt Christine, I think maybe you
better start from the beginning.

360
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,889
You've got to
remember something.

361
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:31,234
Where you came from?

362
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:34,204
How long you've been here?

363
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,073
Something?

364
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,610
Your mother's name, what
was your mother's name?

365
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,443
Why would I remember
my mother's name?

366
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:45,782
I don't know.

367
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,617
Did you have any pets?

368
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,604
Ohhh!

369
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:51,921
What!

370
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:53,724
I just remembered
Ferris Bolton.

371
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,493
Who the devil is Ferris Bolton?

372
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:56,826
He was a friend of mine.

373
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,180
He lived in a farm
across the valley.

374
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:01,464
One day he hit
his head on a rock...

375
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,195
...and he couldn't remember
anything for two days.

376
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:05,836
Well, what happened to him?

377
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,803
He died.

378
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:11,108
But! Just before he died,
he remembered everything.

379
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,269
His mind was
jostled by a sound.

380
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,479
What was it?

381
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,313
One of his cows.

382
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:20,651
He sprung up, said he was late
for milking, and fell over dead.

383
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,817
Excellent!

384
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,655
So that means I need to
find a cow from my childhood

385
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,624
And I'll remember everything!

386
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,324
Don't be ridiculous.

387
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,327
We just need to
jostle your brain.

388
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:33,591
I'm afraid to ask how
you propose to do that.

389
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:35,732
Do you remember
how you got here?

390
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,435
Not a thing.

391
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,437
Was it a boat?
Did you come by boat?

392
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:44,168
It's an island. How else
would I have gotten here?

393
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,542
Right. Then do you
remember where your boat is?

394
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,446
I have no boat.

395
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,849
What do you mean
you have no boat?

396
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,217
You just said you came by boat.

397
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,551
No, no, two days ago...

398
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:58,556
I came upon Samuel's
boat carefully hidden.

399
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,786
That's how I knew he was here.

400
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,727
And I remember thinking
a boat would be useful

401
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,496
since I didn't have one.

402
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,762
Ohhhh!

403
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:09,133
Must you keep doing that?

404
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,132
What is it?

405
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,101
You remembered his name!

406
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:13,895
Yes!

407
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:16,139
It's Samuel.

408
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,376
Samuel Taggart.

409
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,514
Chris: Do you think
this is a good idea?

410
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,349
Chris: You've been
watching him for days.

411
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:26,982
Chris: It's obvious
you know him.

412
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:29,508
Chris: There must be some
reason you haven't gone to him.

413
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:32,737
Eric: Maybe. But if he
knows something

414
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,953
Eric: I've got to
find out what it is.

415
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,460
Chris: There's something
not right about this.

416
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,905
Samuel?

417
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,177
Eric!

418
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:00,041
I must admit, I had
not expected to see you.

419
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:03,342
You've come for
your share I suppose?

420
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:06,889
My share?

421
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,624
You want it all then!

422
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,753
Well you'll have to find it first
and I'll not give it willingly.

423
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:14,263
Samuel, I need your help.

424
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,216
The journal? You'll not have it.

425
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,860
The journal? I don't want...

426
00:27:17,895 --> 00:27:19,470
You've found it haven't you?

427
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,103
You've beaten me to it!

428
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:22,506
What now? Here to
titter in my face?

429
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,475
I need to talk to you Samuel.

430
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,410
Please you have to listen to me.

431
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,775
No!

432
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,446
It's you who'll listen to me.

433
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,483
Let's have it.
What have you done with the gold?

434
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,249
The gold, I have no gold.

435
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:36,251
Samuel please, you've got
to believe me!

436
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:39,084
I don't know what the game is,
but we'll have no more of it.

437
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,591
What my food? The boat?

438
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,793
What have you come for?

439
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,528
This needn't be difficult.

440
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:49,767
You bring me the money, and
I'll split it with you as we agreed.

441
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,735
Now what will it be?

442
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,308
Wait! Get back here!

443
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:03,179
Nooo!

444
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:10,350
Gather your things,
we can't stay here.

445
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,852
Where will we go?

446
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,593
Somewhere... away from here.

447
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:19,829
Eric.

448
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,423
Eric.

449
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,597
I think I have something
that belongs to you.

450
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:36,706
Is it helping?

451
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,843
Not a wit.

452
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,718
But you know who you are...

453
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,254
Yes, I'm Eric DuBois.

454
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,684
I was... or am... a soldier.

455
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,593
A soldier of fortune
it would appear.

456
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:55,155
And Samuel Taggart was
my ally. Though no longer.

457
00:28:57,634 --> 00:28:58,967
But that...

458
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:00,969
A letter to my Captain...

459
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:03,907
...telling him I will join
him at summer's end.

460
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,239
Does nothing to jostle this.

461
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:12,648
There's... one more
thing I can tell you.

462
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,489
The Captain is my father.

463
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:38,942
The Captain you say
was a man of honor.

464
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:40,576
And yet this honorable man

465
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,374
surrounds himself
with what kind of men?

466
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,282
Men who would kill
each other over a bounty.

467
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,117
You're not a killer.

468
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,918
Perhaps I'm not now.

469
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,955
But what was I?

470
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,358
Where do you think he is?

471
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,188
Looking for us.

472
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,802
Watch for Taggart.

473
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,541
He's not here.

474
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,243
What do you mean?

475
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,911
See for yourself.

476
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,612
Chris.

477
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,311
Chris!

478
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,456
There!

479
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:45,933
I'll never find him, will I?

480
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,033
Yes!

481
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:13,229
A very fine specimen indeed!

482
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:15,704
How much is it worth?

483
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,707
I'll give you $200 for it.

484
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:23,373
I could make that $225,
but that's as high as I can go.

485
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,816
What were you hoping for?

486
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,282
175...

487
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,342
Well then, what's the...
- Thousand!

488
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,486
Ah. I see.

489
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:34,191
Well, you do have
a bit of a problem then.

490
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,783
We know.

491
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,459
Thanks. We'll let you know
if we decide to sell it.

492
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,597
No problem. Glad to help.

493
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,374
Oh no, Rose, no!
Whatever it is, no!

494
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,581
Hello children, did you
have a nice trip into town?

495
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,682
Rose, don't do this,
whatever it is, don't do it.

496
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:03,186
I really haven't the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

497
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,154
Mom, tell me please.

498
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,990
I got a call today
from Turner Desmond.

499
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,460
Well actually it wasn't
so much a call from him,

500
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,329
as it was me calling Turner.

501
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:13,528
What did he want?

502
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,163
He wants to buy the ranch.

503
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:17,901
Well that's great news!
I thought no one was interested.

504
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,604
He doesn't count Mom,
he doesn't want to buy the ranch.

505
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,807
He wants... something else.

506
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:24,909
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

507
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,942
We could still live here...

508
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:29,579
...and he'll live, hmm...
wherever it is he lives.

509
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,581
Mom, marriage doesn't
work that way.

510
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,581
I don't get it.

511
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,618
[Sigh] Turner doesn't so
much want to buy the ranch

512
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,585
as he wants to marry Rose.

513
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,851
If Rose decides to marry Turner,
Rose will marry Turner.

514
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,425
It certainly makes a
sight more sense

515
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,791
than a cockamamie
search for fool's gold.

516
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:54,661
Eric! You've got to get Samuel
to tell you where my father is.

517
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:57,539
And how do you
propose we do that?

518
00:32:57,574 --> 00:32:59,576
Last time we spoke,
he tried to kill me.

519
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,544
What then? We've nothing left.

520
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,578
The journal.

521
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:05,532
Of what hope is the journal?

522
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,493
It will lead us to the gold.

523
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,419
I thought you were different.

524
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,856
If we find the gold, perhaps we
might trade it for information.

525
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:16,526
About my father?

526
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,429
And about me.

527
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,070
Uhhhh!

528
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,941
How do we even know
this is the right place?

529
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:38,007
I mean, he probably
can't even read.

530
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,216
Never underestimate
Samuel Taggart.

531
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:43,519
You'll do it only once.

532
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:46,321
You remember something?

533
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,323
[Sigh] Nothing of substance.

534
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,326
But how do we know
this is the place?

535
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:03,905
I found it!

536
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,540
Well you found something.

537
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,543
Rather small for a
Captain's bounty.

538
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:12,312
Wait! I feel prying eyes.

539
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,719
Perhaps we should
seek a more private place.

540
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:33,136
Wait!

541
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,772
I'm going to go make
sure we are alone.

542
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,740
Don't touch it!

543
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:40,243
I'll return shortly.

544
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:03,832
[Exclamation]

545
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,367
That's for the fire.

546
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,370
I told you, you won't
have what's mine.

547
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:15,969
Leave it be lad.
Don't give me reason to really hurt you.

548
00:35:18,515 --> 00:35:20,483
Ahhh!

549
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,687
What's this?

550
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:28,816
Not a lad at all, but a lass?

551
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:34,130
You're the daughter of the Captain.

552
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,065
You hid in the trunk.

553
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,067
Yes! And when
my father finds you,

554
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:41,366
he's going to skin you
like the skunk you are!

555
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,773
Not likely, that.

556
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:46,209
What other surprises
do you have for me?

557
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:49,538
Where's the boy?

558
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,813
Come now, where is he?

559
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,510
He's gone. Gone to get a rifle.

560
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:57,286
And then he's
coming back for you!

561
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:10,566
What does this mean?

562
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:11,967
I've no idea.

563
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:13,970
Don't play coy with me,
what does it signify?

564
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,806
It's my father's whistle.

565
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,433
I know that!

566
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,342
But why is it here?

567
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,403
It's a whistle! I've no
idea why it's here.

568
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:26,014
Except...

569
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,918
...It means that
my father was here.

570
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,651
Noooo!

571
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,654
I'll not be denied what's mine!

572
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,558
The Captain, plotted against me.

573
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,994
I'll not be lied to again.

574
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:41,092
Let's have it. What have
you done with the gold?

575
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:45,635
It's enough that you know,
that I'll do what I have to.

576
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,603
Now where's the gold?

577
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,572
Ahhh!

578
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:07,089
Is he dead?

579
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:09,357
Near enough.

580
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:11,261
We should have known
he would be watching.

581
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,229
You weren't ever
in any real danger.

582
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,261
You... left me here, for him to find.

583
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,959
Chris I'm sorry, but we
had to have the journal.

584
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:22,996
He would have killed
me while you watched.

585
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:25,308
It had to happen this way.

586
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,276
Don't touch it!

587
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,612
Sit!

588
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,258
Chris, you're being unreasonable.

589
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:45,527
Quiet! I'm thinking!

590
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,362
[Moans]

591
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:49,365
Well think quickly lass.

592
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:02,044
A little tighter maybe?

593
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:06,340
I'm a sailor's daughter.
I know how to tie a knot.

594
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,550
So is it Chris or Christine?

595
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,815
Didn't see any point in telling you.

596
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,723
Perhaps there wasn't.

597
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:15,149
[Moans]

598
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,796
Can you walk?

599
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,030
Well?

600
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,534
Nothing yet.

601
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:02,367
It truly is a journal,
though not of my father's.

602
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,376
What is this gold you search for?

603
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:10,212
Why ask me, you
know as well as I.

604
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:13,182
Remind me.

605
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,284
What addles your brain boy?

606
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:21,223
You've lost your memory.

607
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:24,226
But you remembered my name.

608
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,662
I remember small things.

609
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,998
Inconsequential things.

610
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,302
What happened to my father?

611
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,269
I fear we've failed him.

612
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:36,272
We promised to deliver you safely.

613
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,774
Eric...

614
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:41,477
...bring me my daughter.

615
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:46,015
I swear it!

616
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,622
Something comes to you?

617
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,317
Just a notion.

618
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:55,690
The Captain...

619
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:57,692
We can still make
good on our promise.

620
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,562
We can find the treasure
and return the girl

621
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,530
and the gold, back to
the good Captain.

622
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:03,498
You know where to find him?

623
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,501
He'll be waiting for our return.

624
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:07,903
You've trussed the wrong man!

625
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,072
Untie me and I'll help
you find the treasure.

626
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:14,310
I'll think on it.

627
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,948
I'll be watching...

628
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,817
...both of you.

629
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:36,632
He bears watching.

630
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,404
But we'll see if we can trust him.

631
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,274
But if not...

632
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,712
...do you have your shovel handy?

633
00:40:57,854 --> 00:40:59,822
What am I looking for?

634
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:05,961
You'll know it when you find it.

635
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:17,773
I think I found it!

636
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,485
I wish you had that journal.

637
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,453
But I do.

638
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,121
You have the Captain's journal?

639
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:35,954
It's the only thing I still have
that belonged to my father.

640
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:39,957
Sam, the journal's in that box,
over there on my dresser.

641
00:41:58,114 --> 00:41:59,914
Are you sure this is
the right journal?

642
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:01,951
There's nothing in here but
stuff about the Civil War.

643
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,919
It belonged to the
Captain's grandfather.

644
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:06,155
Go to the back of the book.

645
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:14,196
It's here!

646
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,699
Now all we have to do is
go back to the island

647
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,667
and follow the map!

648
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,837
C'mon, what are you waiting for?

649
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,574
Don't you think they've
tried that already?

650
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,776
We'll try again.

651
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:30,245
Perhaps I overlooked something.

652
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,475
Yeah like the fact that
there's nothing there.

653
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:58,941
So you planned to
leave without me?

654
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:02,645
You untied him?

655
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,382
Actually I untied myself.

656
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,618
I thought we could
use a good breakfast

657
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,586
before we go after the gold.

658
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,458
What have you
done with the journal?

659
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:18,994
I believe it's under your
bedroll where you put it.

660
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,937
Why didn't you wake me?

661
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:31,104
You looked tired.
I thought you could use the rest.

662
00:43:31,774 --> 00:43:34,038
While you formed
your cozy partnership.

663
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:36,712
An alliance of sorts.

664
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:39,816
I don't trust him!

665
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,784
Nor I.

666
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:44,086
But we need him.

667
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:14,050
the Captain called
this his inheritance.

668
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,017
Southern gold, marked for the war.

669
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,953
Buried here by his grandfather
to keep out of Union hands.

670
00:44:19,555 --> 00:44:21,523
The map was passed
down from father to son.

671
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:25,228
We know the Captain was here,
this has to be the right spot.

672
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,458
The sketch is clear,
we go through the window.

673
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:31,930
Perhaps digging will
jog your addled brain.

674
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:42,245
- We need water.
- I know.

675
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,542
[LAUGHTER]

676
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:53,988
Rose?

677
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:56,392
I thought we were going to put
our social calendar on hold?

678
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,394
Aren't you headed off to a picnic?

679
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,413
You know it's not a picnic.

680
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,398
Mr. Desmond, can I be frank?

681
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,366
Both: No!

682
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:08,571
Turner, I don't want to be rude,
but the ranch is not for sale.

683
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:11,540
Sam, why don't you and your
friend run outside and play.

684
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:14,374
You're putting your nose
where it don't belong.

685
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:16,913
I thought you said the climate
around here had changed?

686
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,212
It has.

687
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:20,182
Well it don't hardly seem like it.

688
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,083
- It's gotten colder.
- Yeah.

689
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:24,253
Respectfully Ma'am,
I think you could do a whole lot better.

690
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,221
Nobody's talking to you boy!

691
00:45:27,123 --> 00:45:29,625
You know Sam, I think you're right.
The ranch isn't for sale.

692
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,128
Well who are you to be telling
me what's for sale and what isn't?

693
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:34,096
I'm a 50 percent owner,
that's who I am.

694
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,082
And I'm the other 50 percent.

695
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:37,699
What are you talking about?

696
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,268
That old delusional goat owns...

697
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:40,868
50 percent!

698
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:42,870
That's 150 percent.

699
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:44,672
And none of it's for sale.

700
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:46,675
You got 150 percent of nothing.

701
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,648
You know he's right.

702
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:55,810
I'm a patient man. I can wait.

703
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:58,488
But somebody is going
to own this place

704
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:00,456
and it may just as well be me.

705
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:04,226
I don't like being toyed with.

706
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,661
Yeah!

707
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,373
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

708
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,809
Cause there went our last chance.

709
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:33,889
There's the window!

710
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:38,227
That's got to be it.

711
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:43,165
So where do we dig?

712
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:45,301
You know, I'm not an experienced
treasure hunter, but...

713
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,769
I'm pretty sure that's
what the big X is for.

714
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:28,761
We're going about this all wrong.

715
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:30,605
Oh now this I've got to hear.

716
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,380
No serious, think about it.

717
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:34,747
Sam, this gold was
crucial to the war.

718
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:36,435
I mean, what makes you think that

719
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,912
they're going to draw
up some map

720
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,355
that's going to lead us right to it?

721
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,322
It doesn't make any sense.

722
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,092
It's like we are missing something.

723
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,060
So like, there's another map?

724
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,830
I don't know.

725
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:01,476
[KNOCKING]

726
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,353
Where is everybody?
I can't get them to answer the door.

727
00:48:11,654 --> 00:48:13,656
Maybe they just
don't want to talk to you.

728
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,091
What are you doing here?

729
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:16,492
Did you have a good day?

730
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,027
Because I did.

731
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:18,893
[Laughs]

732
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:20,196
Henry what is he talking about?

733
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,464
Where's Rose and Christine?

734
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,097
You can talk to us!

735
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:25,100
I don't converse with children.

736
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:27,568
Are my ears on backwards?

737
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:29,538
Cause I only hear you
when you're going away.

738
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,540
Henry do you see the abuse I take?

739
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,840
Yep, I see it.

740
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,275
Why don't you go on out to the car.
I'll take care of this.

741
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:39,513
So what did he want?

742
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:41,182
Well if it goes like he plans.

743
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:43,447
You've only got 3 days to
come up with the money.

744
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,289
3 days as in 72 hours?

745
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:48,256
More like 46.

746
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,925
How does 3 days
equal up to 46 hours?

747
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,630
Well, it was 3 days this morning.
You've got until Friday at 6 P.M.

748
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:55,930
But today is shot...

749
00:48:55,965 --> 00:48:57,867
Today shouldn't count!
We just found out!

750
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:59,500
- Why should today count...
- Sam...

751
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:01,337
It's not fair! If we had
the full 3 days...

752
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,305
- Sam!
- What?

753
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,139
What does it matter?

754
00:49:05,174 --> 00:49:08,541
3 days, 3 years, we're never
going to find that money.

755
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,187
Can you take me to my father?

756
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:22,024
I'm sure he'll tell you where
the treasure is, and...

757
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,992
...then we won't have
to do all this digging.

758
00:49:24,694 --> 00:49:27,288
I'll not return to the Captain
without his gold.

759
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:39,706
Did you leave a girl behind?

760
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,177
Of course not.

761
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:45,079
How can you be so sure?

762
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:47,349
I just think that's something
that I would remember.

763
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,584
Why would you remember that when you
remember so little?

764
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,990
Samuel, can you tell me
anything about my family?

765
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,276
You rarely spoke much
about your home.

766
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:58,492
Come now, I must
have said something.

767
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,121
Perhaps there was some
girl somewhere, pining away.

768
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:04,427
Yes.

769
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,868
There was one in Westbrook.

770
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:10,772
And one in Roxberry.

771
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,501
And another one in Abbot Village.

772
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:16,011
[Laughs]

773
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:20,515
[More laughter]

774
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:35,196
What is it?

775
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:37,199
I'm not speaking to you.

776
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:39,300
These numbers...

777
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:40,962
...what do they mean?

778
00:50:41,537 --> 00:50:43,004
Figures.

779
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,041
Something from the
war, I suppose.

780
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,008
That makes little sense.

781
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,307
The journal was written
in a different hand.

782
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,439
The map was obviously
added later.

783
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,976
These numbers are part of the map.
Not the journal.

784
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,953
That must mean something?

785
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,921
Yes. But what?

786
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:03,753
Something tickles my mind.
We used to play a game.

787
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,428
With my father's sextant.

788
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:10,031
We'd use it horizontally.

789
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,193
Not the way you
normally read a sextant.

790
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:15,070
The map shows us
where we begin.

791
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:17,965
The number is the
angle of the sextant arm.

792
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:20,641
Line it up.

793
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:22,644
Through the window.

794
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,897
And it tells you
what direction to go.

795
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:26,747
That'd give you the line of travel.

796
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,750
But we can't dig a
trench from here to the bay.

797
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,453
It could be anywhere
along that line.

798
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:34,122
It's just a game we played.

799
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:36,859
Well! I think the
Captain's daughter

800
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,526
has just solved the mystery.

801
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:41,328
An easy task for
someone not occupied

802
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:44,992
trying to remember which
girl he left in which town.

803
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:47,868
It's of little use.
We've no sextant.

804
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,005
Samuel, can you take
us back to the Captain?

805
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,508
It would seem I have
little choice in the matter.

806
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,343
How is she?

807
00:52:28,577 --> 00:52:29,942
Sleeping.

808
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,448
Do you think we made her worse?

809
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:36,579
I don't know.

810
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:40,814
She says she's too old
to go to the hospital.

811
00:52:44,226 --> 00:52:46,194
Sometimes when people
get stubborn...

812
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:49,865
...they die.

813
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:54,770
You're supposed to look
through the window.

814
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:56,272
I know, I know!

815
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,705
What's the reading?

816
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,708
Well the first number is 16.

817
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:02,210
16 degrees.

818
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:04,545
What do you see?

819
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,365
Hold on, give me a minute.

820
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,115
Something in that direction.

821
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,052
How far? How do we
know where to dig?

822
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,020
I don't know. Let me see the map.

823
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:16,925
What is that? Is that a 5?

824
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:18,993
It's a 55.

825
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:20,996
Or is it two separate 5's?

826
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,229
Maybe.

827
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,100
5 or 55?

828
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:27,301
Feet I guess?

829
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:29,338
Or maybe the number of steps?

830
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,804
Try them both!

831
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,502
One... two... three... four...

832
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,711
Five!

833
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:39,280
It's solid rock!

834
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:41,283
Maybe they have bigger feet.

835
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:45,020
We try 55.

836
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:58,734
19 hours...
we're down to 19 hours aren't we?

837
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,702
Something like that.

838
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:04,039
You didn't sell it to them did you?

839
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,235
No child, we're not going
to sell the Princess.

840
00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:11,344
They'll have to take it from us!

841
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,243
Where will you go?

842
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,813
We've still got till
tomorrow afternoon.

843
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,885
Would you really
have married him?

844
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:54,489
Yeah, I guess I would.

845
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,498
You could come with us.

846
00:55:19,214 --> 00:55:21,181
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

847
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:23,798
We're just heading out to
the island one last time.

848
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,380
I'm glad I didn't miss you.
I intend to go with you.

849
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:29,992
Are you sure?
Don't you just want to stay here and rest?

850
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,959
Rest for what?

851
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:34,588
I have eternity to rest.

852
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:37,132
I have a hankering
to see the island again.

853
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,800
And you may be starting
at the wrong boulder.

854
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,238
And you may be senile.

855
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,069
And you're probably
on the wrong island.

856
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:49,244
How could I be on the
wrong island?

857
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:51,746
There's only one island.

858
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:23,912
He's gone!

859
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:26,215
What do you mean he's gone?

860
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,081
He's gone!

861
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:29,584
He is no longer here!
He's vanished!

862
00:56:31,887 --> 00:56:33,855
Where would he go?

863
00:56:42,297 --> 00:56:43,992
Eric!

864
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:46,034
Eric, tell me you have the journal!

865
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,368
You were sleeping on it.

866
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:50,770
I know. But I took it out
because it was too lumpy.

867
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:53,541
And the pistol?

868
00:56:56,545 --> 00:56:58,638
Maybe he'll come back?

869
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:01,111
I very much doubt
we'll ever see him again.

870
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:10,008
I knew we never
should have trusted him.

871
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:12,059
We should have tied
him up again last night.

872
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:15,029
It wouldn't have made a difference.
He would have just untied it.

873
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:17,149
He played us for fools.

874
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,899
I know more than one knot.

875
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:20,936
Yeah, then why did you pick
one that is easily untied?

876
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,302
Because it hurts!

877
00:57:22,337 --> 00:57:24,339
Well remind me never
to make you angry.

878
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,307
It's too late!

879
00:57:28,076 --> 00:57:29,270
Eric!

880
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,987
It's still here.

881
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:42,322
It's still here!

882
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:44,325
You said that already.

883
00:57:45,227 --> 00:57:47,195
I know what I said, it's just...

884
00:57:47,696 --> 00:57:49,363
Why hasn't he left?

885
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:51,366
He could have abandoned us.

886
00:57:51,633 --> 00:57:53,066
Chris.

887
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:55,871
Would the Captain have
carried a sextant in his chest?

888
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:57,838
It's possible.

00:57:57,873 --> 00:57:59,573
But the chest was destroyed.

890
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:01,872
Samuel had the sextant all along.

891
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,675
There's nothing to stop him
from getting the gold.

892
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:07,115
Chris, we can't leave him!

893
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,348
Why?

894
00:58:08,383 --> 00:58:10,035
The gold means nothing to me.

895
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,652
Eric, this is our chance.

896
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:14,323
He's occupied elsewhere,
we have the boat.

897
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:16,291
Let's go now, please!

898
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:18,325
Just you and me.

899
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,960
I thought you were
still angry with me.

900
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:22,259
I'll have plenty of time to
be angry at you later.

901
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:24,765
Let's just go!

902
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,961
Eric, don't leave me!

903
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:31,306
Ohhh!

904
00:58:57,966 --> 00:58:59,401
Do you ever do as you're told?

905
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:00,801
I'm tired of being left behind.

906
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:02,804
Well you're left behind
for your own good.

907
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:05,038
It never seems to work
out that way.

908
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:07,871
Are you sure you want to be with a
man who has a girl in every village?

909
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:09,494
That's rubbish.

910
00:59:09,529 --> 00:59:10,878
How do you know?

911
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:11,945
There aren't that many girls

912
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,948
that could possibly
stand to be around you.

913
00:59:15,617 --> 00:59:18,211
So if our relationship
were to continue...

914
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:22,023
...can I always expect
you to be this stubborn?

915
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:25,058
Always.

916
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:27,078
And you'll obey me
in just such a manner

917
00:59:27,113 --> 00:59:29,063
as you've done,
since I've known you?

918
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:31,199
In just such a manner.

919
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:35,404
And I can expect you to
follow me around incessantly

920
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,964
just as you have
these past days and nights?

921
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:41,976
I'll never leave your side.

922
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,278
And you desire such a relationship?

923
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,551
With all my heart.

924
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:54,521
But not yet.

925
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:56,524
I'm still far too angry at you!

926
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:12,774
How will we find him?

927
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:16,945
At least we know
where he has to begin.

928
01:00:28,857 --> 01:00:30,525
We're running out of time.

929
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,491
I know!

930
01:00:31,526 --> 01:00:33,493
We only have about 6 hours left...

931
01:00:33,528 --> 01:00:35,530
...and it will take us an hour
to get back down to the boat.

932
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:36,730
You're not helping!

933
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:39,134
And it will take another two hours
to row back, and that...

934

Sam! Shut up!

935
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,605
Is this the place?

936
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,338
Yes.

937
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:45,772
But how do we know how far?

938
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:48,037
I mean, it's got to be one
of these last figures here.

939
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:50,161
5 something?

940
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:52,012
5 miles? 5 feet?

941
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:54,348
It was my Great-Grandfather's
final puzzle.

942
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:57,419
What happened to Taggart?
Isn't it possible that he found the gold?

943
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:00,288
We searched for him, thinking
that he might have left us

944
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,274
stranded on the island,
but he hadn't.

945
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:04,226
We came back here,
no wiser than before.

946
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,643
We had no sextant, and no journal.

947
01:01:06,678 --> 01:01:09,026
Eric, what are we looking for?

948
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:15,994
Rocks.

949
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:18,305
There are rocks everywhere.

950
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,672
An easy area to defend if
someone should follow you.

01:01:21,276 --> 01:01:23,244
An escape route to the water.

01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:26,707
I feel for the girl.
But I didn't ask her to join us on this journey.

962
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:28,743
For that matter,
I didn't ask you either.

You would have been
better off with the Captain.

01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:48,399
It's five-thirty.

1067
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,749
What's he doing here?

1068
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:51,184
I heard there was
going to be an auction.

1069
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:53,988
I came out to see if maybe
you were selling anything.

1070
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,388
Quit stalling Henry!
And let's get on with it.

1071
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:58,760
You really have no claim until six.

1072
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,160
Wait, what do you mean claim?

1073
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:02,288
He's not the bank,
it's still got to go to auction.

1074
01:10:02,864 --> 01:10:04,831
Tell her Henry.

1075
01:10:04,866 --> 01:10:06,834
Not that it's the business of a child.

1076
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:10,161
He bought the bank's interest.
He owns the note.

1077
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:12,805
Can he do that?

1078
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,707
Can and did! I own this place!

1079
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:18,402
Not yet you don't!
Not until 6 o'clock.

1080
01:10:18,746 --> 01:10:21,282
And ain't nobody
doing nothing 'till then.

1081
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,250
Eviction notice not withstanding.

1082
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:26,616
And when you serve it,
it may take me days to get out.

1083
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:28,321
And you'll go to jail!

1084
01:10:28,356 --> 01:10:29,958
I'll do nothing you tell me to do!

1085
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:31,926
Nobody's going anywhere.

1086
01:10:40,068 --> 01:10:42,036
We found the money!

1087
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:48,274
How much you got here?

1088
01:10:48,309 --> 01:10:50,277
Well, we haven't had a
chance to count it yet.

1089
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:53,780
But...

1090
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:55,683
What kind of money is this?

1091
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,419
Just old stuff. Money's money.

1092
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:59,085
They're Confederate bills.

1093
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,853
The Captain called it
his inheritance.

1094
01:11:00,888 --> 01:11:03,725
But his grandfather hid it to keep
it away from some Union soldiers.

1095
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,325
This stuff's no good!

1096
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,227
You can't pay with
Confederate dollars.

1097
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,430
This stuff hasn't been good
for over a hundred years!

1098
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:10,865
What's he talking about?

1099
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,833
He may be right.

1100
01:11:13,635 --> 01:11:15,134
Where'd you get this?

1101
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:17,501
Aunt Christine, it belonged
to her father?

1102
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:21,342
Jefferson Davis, President of
the Confederacy, is her father?

1103
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,309
Jefferson who?

1104
01:11:23,344 --> 01:11:26,370
Why you so worried about the journal?
Is it worth something?

1105
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:29,048
It could be worth
more than something.

1106
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,552
If this journal can be
authenticated...

1107
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,520
It could be worth...

1108
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:36,880
Well it could easily go for...

1109
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:38,524
How much?

1110
01:11:38,559 --> 01:11:41,619
Two... three hundred...
four hundred thousand... at auction.

1111
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:44,899
In cash, I'll give you
two hundred and fifty.

1112
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,751
If you're interested.

1113
01:11:46,786 --> 01:11:48,534
If we're interested?

1114
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:51,339
Oh no you don't!
I need a check in my hand right now.

1115
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,606
Henry... tell them they can't do this.

1116
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:56,744
Authentication and a check.
How long is this going to take?

1117
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:59,447
Well in view of the circumstances...

1118
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,600
...I could rush things along.

1119
01:12:01,635 --> 01:12:03,718
I could get a check in 24 hours.

1120
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,051
Hah! That's too late!

1121
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:07,088
I need a check in
my hand within 5 minutes

1122
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,921
or this place belongs to me!

1123
01:12:08,956 --> 01:12:11,857
Here you go sir, $175,000 dollars!

1124
01:12:11,926 --> 01:12:13,894
This check is no good!

1125
01:12:13,995 --> 01:12:15,862
Henry are you going to
let them get away with this?

1126
01:12:15,897 --> 01:12:18,566
Oh it will be good by the time
the bank opens on Monday morning.

1127
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:20,201
Henry, do something!

1128
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:22,169
Okay.

1129
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:24,070
[Ripping paper]
[Laughter]

1130
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,665
I'll sue you. I'll sue every one
of you for every dollar you've got!

1131
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:29,509
I'll sue every one of you!

1132
01:12:29,544 --> 01:12:32,843
Do you hear anything?
I feel a breeze, but I can't hear anything.

1133
01:12:33,214 --> 01:12:34,932
That's cuz our ears
are on backwards.

1134
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,650
We only hear him when
he's walking away.

1135
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,522
[Laughter and cheers]

1136
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:46,861
C'mon, let's go get Aunt Christine!

1137
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:47,850
Kids!

1138
01:12:50,098 --> 01:12:52,066
I'm sorry.

1139
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,635
Your Aunt Christine died last night.

1140
01:12:55,269 --> 01:12:57,338
What do you mean?
She's out on the island.

1141
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,038
She was fine when we left her.

1142
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:01,633
Sam, Honey, don't do
this to yourself.

1143
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:05,242
She had a good life.
And she's in a better place now.

1144
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:09,581
Tell them. Tell them J. T!
Tell them she came with us.

1145
01:13:11,018 --> 01:13:12,986
Tell them!

1146
01:13:16,557 --> 01:13:18,855
She died sometime
during the night.

1147
01:13:19,327 --> 01:13:22,819
She's upstairs in her room,
if you want to say goodbye.

1148
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:01,001
It's okay.

1149
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,538
She gets what she wanted.

1150
01:14:06,874 --> 01:14:08,842
She finally gets to go home.

1151
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:48,247
You certainly took your time.

1152
01:14:48,282 --> 01:14:50,250
I told you I would fulfill my oath.

1153
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,151
Is that the only reason
you came back here?

1154
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:55,522
Well isn't that reason enough?

1155
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,392
Whoa, hey where are you going?

1156
01:14:59,427 --> 01:15:02,697
If the only reason you came
back was to fulfill some silly oath...

1157
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:05,063
Is that all your mouth
can do is chatter?

1158
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,168
Chatter?

1159
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,188
I told you I'd come back for you.

1160
01:15:38,432 --> 01:15:41,184
Where are we going?

1161
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:43,937
We're going home!

1162
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:50,077
The Captain is expecting us.

1163
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:55,015
Your mom has dinner waiting.

1164
01:16:05,226 --> 01:16:07,820
I'd waited a lifetime for love.

1165
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:11,723
Some things are worth waiting for!

1166
01:16:14,969 --> 01:16:16,737
What do you think?

1167
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,471
It's beautiful.

1168
01:16:18,506 --> 01:16:20,474
Except for one thing.

1169
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,610
What do you mean,
except for one thing?

1170
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:24,079
It's perfect!

1171
01:16:24,114 --> 01:16:25,478
Not quite.

1172
01:16:25,513 --> 01:16:27,181
What do you mean, not quite?

1173
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:28,849
I'm telling you it's perfect!

1174
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,685
If you say so.

1175
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,151
I say so.

1176
01:16:32,186 --> 01:16:34,188
Except for one thing.

1177
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,588
What?

1178
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:37,921
You misspelled "Management."

1179
01:16:38,693 --> 01:16:39,992
I did not.

1180
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,794
You did, you misspelled it.

1181
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:44,263
Well if you're the genius,
why'd you let me do it?

1182
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:47,001
I never said your lettering was bad,
I just said you couldn't spell.

1183
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:48,769
Oh and I suppose
you could do better.

1184
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,536
What, lettering or spelling?

1185
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:52,840
It's not my fault you can't
make a good billboard.

1186
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:55,074
I can make a good billboard.
It looks awesome!

1187
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:57,111
Management, it's a simple word.
It's an "e" not an "a".

1188
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,079
Managament, that's
what you spelled.

1189
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:01,280
I mean people get the gist.

1190
01:17:01,315 --> 01:17:04,752
I mean seriously, it's not like they're
going to think it's something else.

1191
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,754
It's not like you're stupid.

1192
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,955
Did you go to school?

1193
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,692
Because I'm pretty sure that's
the first word in the "M's"...

1194
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,660
Well, I'm probably smarter
than you, anyway.

1195
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:17,764
You're blond too.

1196
01:19:17,765 --> 01:19:18,765
