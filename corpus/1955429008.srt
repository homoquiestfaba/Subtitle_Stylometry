1
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,581
<i>Most people can hold their
breath for about 30 seconds.</i>

2
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,718
<i>I can hold mine for 99.</i>

3
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,756
<i>And Andy Walton
takes an early lead</i>

4
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,326
<i>against the Lane number two
swimmer, Clayton stone.</i>

5
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,835
<i>See, 99 seconds is exactly
how long I needed</i>

6
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,605
<i>to win the district championship
in the 200 meter freestyle,</i>

7
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,408
<i>with Claire Broman, the girl
of my dreams, in the stands.</i>

8
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,581
<i>It's Andy Walton and Clayton
stone neck and neck here today.</i>

9
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,152
Yeah, Clayton!

10
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,788
Come on, Andy.
Come on.

11
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,023
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

12
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,158
<i>Walton and stone are
just one stroke apart</i>

13
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,962
<i>as we near the end
of the 200 meters.</i>

14
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:21,133
<i>I was on the brink of a college
scholarship and a whole new life.</i>

15
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,302
<i>Clayton stone
seizes the championship</i>

16
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,437
<i>by one stroke from Andy Walton!</i>

17
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:40,319
<i>But in 99 seconds, all my
dreams came to a crashing end.</i>

18
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,055
<i>Things pretty much went
straight downhill after that.</i>

19
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,366
Hey, sorry I'm late.

20
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,903
Hey, sucks about the race.

21
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,406
Okay, loser, whatever. You're
gonna hook us up, right?

22
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,742
Party at your
place after, right?

23
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,043
Sure.

24
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,413
Okay. Meet me outside
in 60 seconds.

25
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,895
That was awesome.

26
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,299
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,368
Change of plans.

28
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,136
That kid right there in the hat.

29
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,338
Let's go, let's go,
come on, get in!

30
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,473
Hey!

31
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,141
Don't be an ass, Ryan!
Open the door!

32
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,276
Go, go, go, let's go!

33
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,217
Hey, thanks for
the score, loser!

34
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:51,256
<i>Truth be told, this wasn't the
first time I'd gotten busted.</i>

35
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,626
<i>It was the third this month.</i>

36
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,995
<i>Man, I was in for it.</i>

37
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,199
You okay?
Mmm. Yeah.

38
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,270
The store's not
pressing charges,

39
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,306
provided it never happens again.

40
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,808
I can guarantee that.

41
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,777
You jeopardize your mom's job,

42
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,245
not to mention getting
me pulled off the line,

43
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,315
which you well know this family
cannot afford right now.

44
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,484
You need to learn
your place, Andy.

45
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,354
I don't have a place.

46
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,791
It's time.

47
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,628
What? No.
After this?

48
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,431
Maybe mark can go, too.
I don't know.

49
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,032
No, it's out of the question.

50
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,634
What's out of the question?

51
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,669
You're gonna go
see your uncle Trent.

52
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,272
Jim, you can't
just make this call.

53
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,474
Who is uncle Trent?

54
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,347
<i>Trent, pick up.
I know you're there.</i>

55
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,684
<i>Come on, man, we need to talk.
It's about Andy.</i>

56
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,101
What's this?

57
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,136
Huh.

58
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,972
"To my son, Jim." What?

59
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,675
What are you doing
with my backpack?

60
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,810
It's got all my
tools in perfect order.

61
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,846
Not anymore.
Go back to bed.

62
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,750
Where are you going?

63
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,785
They think that they can send me

64
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,388
to stay with someone
that I've never even met.

65
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,223
I mean, do you even
know who this guy is?

66
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,225
Have you seen any pictures
of this uncle Trent?

67
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,527
It doesn't make any sense.

68
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,398
Well, screw that. I can hitchhike
100 miles before they even notice.

69
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,766
Be good.

70
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,668
No, Andy, you can't.
Mark, quiet, okay?

71
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,903
No. I'm tougher
than I look. I'll yell.

72
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,104
No, don't yell.

73
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,408
Mom! Dad!
Andy's running away!

74
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,477
- Andy! Stay right there!
- I'm coming down.

75
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,912
Thanks.

76
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,015
You're welcome.

77
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,287
<i>So, there I was,</i>

78
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,723
<i>leaving a town and a school
that didn't want me,</i>

79
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,826
<i>and a family that didn't
seem to want me, either.</i>

80
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:17,602
<i>Little did I know the biggest race of
my life was just around the corner.</i>

81
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,273
Is that him?

82
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,943
Yep, sure is.

83
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,557
Brought you some fish.

84
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,758
Can I hold it?

85
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,426
Yeah, well, it's heavy.

86
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,597
Disgusting!

87
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,433
Hello, Andy.

88
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,135
Hello,
uncle whoever-you-are.

89
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,171
Trent.
Your uncle Trent.

90
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,111
Do you think you can manage
both boys for the weekend?

91
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,347
Okay.

92
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,448
Yes!

93
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,883
What? No!
There is no way!

94
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,052
Mark has
a serious ear condition.

95
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,521
He needs to avoid
water at all costs.

96
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,389
So, he can't swim at all?
No.

97
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,358
It is bad enough I gotta
be trapped on this island.

98
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,060
You're gonna stick
me with mark, too?

99
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,295
Hey, come on.

100
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,130
- What?
- Listen to me.

101
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,935
I know you're pissed at me.

102
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,204
I want you to take
care of yourself,

103
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,174
and make sure you
watch over mark, okay?

104
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,511
Promise me you will wear
this all day, every day,

105
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,813
and never, ever take it off.

106
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,583
You know this is a mistake.

107
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,727
Bye, mom! Bye, dad! I love you!

108
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,242
Okay, jump out and
tie us off, will you?

109
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,849
Okay, boys, there's only
one rule on this island.

110
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,251
That is any time you go anywhere
near the water, wear a vest.

111
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,488
When the currents
are bad, you'll feel

112
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,290
like you're being
flushed down the toilet.

113
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,599
"Walton island"?
Is that us?

114
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,800
Once upon a time.

115
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,368
Why are they taking it down?

116
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,707
Hey!

117
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,076
What are you doing?

118
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,311
We got two months.

119
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,514
So, they're changing
the name of our island?

120
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,016
You can do that?

121
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,919
Pay off the right people,
you can do anything.

122
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,455
Come on, let's take a picture.
Keep it up.

123
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,530
That's the way
we should've come.

124
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,567
Who is that?

125
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,638
Smile.

126
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,478
Wicked.

127
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,356
Is there a town?

128
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,625
Yep, about a mile away.

129
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,593
Hey, what's that over
there on the West Side?

130
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,196
Nothing.

131
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,998
What do you mean "nothing"?

132
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,001
You've lived on this island your whole
life. You don't know what that is?

133
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,103
I just told you what it is.
It's nothing.

134
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,940
Stash your gear,
and when I get back,

135
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,577
I wanna show you how to
wrap some fish guts.

136
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,866
Twenty.

137
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,000
Is this bad?

138
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,502
Yeah.

139
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,604
I'm all in.

140
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,840
Flush.

141
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:22,941
Not good enough.

142
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,211
Oh! Busted.

143
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,783
Unbelievable.

144
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,192
I'll show you how to
make one, if you want.

145
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,195
You write a little note, shove
it in there with the ship,

146
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,498
and you launch it out to sea.

147
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,832
Let me get this straight.

148
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,434
You just write
these little letters,

149
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,203
build these little ships
and throw 'em all away?

150
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,306
Gotta do something with
these bottles, don't I?

151
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,610
So, enlighten me, Trent, since this
whole island is named after us,

152
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,912
we probably weren't always
broke like we are now.

153
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,949
Bingo. You win.
We were rich.

154
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,885
Now, see, you're
gonna have to elaborate

155
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,921
'cause I only know what
it's like to grow up poor.

156
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,757
I mean, you and my dad
were just, I don't know,

157
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,827
go out to restaurants and eat
every night sort of rich?

158
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,162
Like what?

159
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,898
No, no, not like that.

160
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,332
Dynasty rich.

161
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,902
The kind of wealth
that generations and

162
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,437
generations of families
could live off of.

163
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,140
This was our island.

164
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,109
So, what happened?

165
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,146
Time for bed.

166
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,018
Come on, what happened?

167
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,089
I don't know.

168
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,425
No one knows.

169
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,396
They found my
father's boat drifting,

170
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,066
and I never saw him again.

171
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,502
You're saying that we,
the Walton family,

172
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,904
we used to have millions,
and now it's gone?

173
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,106
And you, you've never even
bothered to look for it.

174
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:06,110
Yeah, I did.
Of course, I did.

175
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,746
Well, then where's the money?

176
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,782
It's here.

177
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,917
Somewhere.
I don't know.

178
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,986
Had to let it go.

179
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,055
Are you serious?

180
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,724
Yeah.

181
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,896
And you gotta let it go, kid.

182
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,807
Don't worry.
He'll be back, eventually.

183
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,208
Ever see a compass lock?

184
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,579
Have I ever?
Watch and learn.

185
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,850
So, was grandpa
really a millionaire?

186
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,886
He was a lot more than that.

187
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,854
He was a code breaker
during world war ii.

188
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,724
He loved his secrets.

189
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,461
Made the most amazing treasure
hunts for us on our birthday.

190
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,868
I remember the last big hunt.

191
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,671
We actually got to use
a real decoder from the war.

192
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:18,216
The last hunt, it took us three
days to find our presents.

193
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,751
Three whole days.

194
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,519
Done.

195
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,292
Stupid uncle.

196
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,894
Stupid...

197
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,343
Move, and I put a hole in you.

198
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,477
Look, I'm sorry.

199
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,080
I said, don't move!

200
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,919
On your knees. And put your
hands where I can see 'em.

201
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,755
What's your name, boy?

202
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,157
Look, just chill, all right?

203
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,491
Name!

204
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,260
I'm Andrew Walton.
I'm Trent Walton's nephew.

205
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,795
The guy who owns
the tackle shop!

206
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,765
I know who he is,
and now I know who you are.

207
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:11,536
You ain't the first Walton to go
after your granddaddy's treasure.

208
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:15,340
But I catch you again, I'll
make sure you're the last.

209
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,011
Yeah, whatever, man.

210
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,514
Have a nice nature walk?

211
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,318
It's here. He just didn't
know where to look for it.

212
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,821
Probably because he never
found grandpa's treasure map.

213
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,423
What'd you say?

214
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:09,660
Uncle Trent told me all about
it while you were gone.

215
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,498
Why are you wearing
your life preserver?

216
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,868
'Cause mom told me to.
Plus it's cozy.

217
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,037
What exactly did
Trent tell you, mark?

218
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,239
Just that grandpa liked secrets.

219
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,341
He would make
dad and uncle Trent

220
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,410
go on treasure hunts
to find their presents.

221
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,111
It's all starting to make sense.

222
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,447
He wanted them to go
on one last hunt together.

223
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,215
So, we're going on
the hunt instead?

224
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,483
Not we. Me.

225
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,718
Oh, come on.

226
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,520
Every don Quixote
needs a Sancho Panza.

227
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,188
You are such a nerd.

228
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,757
Uncle Trent says it's as
good as gone anyways.

229
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,793
You know what? Uncle Trent
had his chance, okay?

230
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,094
But it is my turn now,

231
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:46,097
and I'm not gonna be poor
for the rest of my life.

232
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,002
The old man's fortune is real.

233
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:55,206
It's on this island,
and I'm gonna find it.

234
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,219
"To my son, Jim.

235
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,189
"Unfair and unkind
that soon we must part,

236
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:14,125
"but beginnings are endings,
and endings are beginnings.

237
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,095
"Be ready, for at these
crossroads, I await discovery.

238
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,598
"Seek your reward where
the gift of time awaits."

239
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,202
"Gift of time"?

240
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,307
The gift of time.

241
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,230
What are you doing?

242
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,568
You scared me.

243
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,405
It's late, man, go to bed.
We got a big day tomorrow.

244
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,481
That's disgusting.

245
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,782
You're disgusting.

246
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,518
You're disgusting.

247
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,856
Hello. Maybe this island's
not so bad after all.

248
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,625
Turn around, turn around.

249
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,894
Just gotta set up a little
accidental meet and greet.

250
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,295
A little
"hey, how are you?"

251
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,063
Why don't you
just go talk to her?

252
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,932
Look, you don't
even like women, okay?

253
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,667
You probably never will, so...

254
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,068
I like women.
Yeah?

255
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,604
I just don't see
what the big deal is.

256
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,107
Just ask her to get
ice-cream, or something.

257
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,010
Ice-cream? Are you...

258
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,511
Everybody loves ice-cream.

259
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,946
Okay, if you need
to know something,

260
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,182
you need to know that chicks
don't like ice-cream.

261
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,518
They think it makes them fat.

262
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,623
Hey!

263
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,063
Claire?

264
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,070
So, what are you doing here?

265
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,572
Oh. Uh, yeah, easy.

266
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,874
I got busted. So, my parents
sent me to stay with my uncle.

267
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,877
I mean, do you remember? I
stole beer for your boyfriend,

268
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,380
and you left me with a security
guard's knee in my back.

269
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,316
It was awesome.

270
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:21,786
We just got here yesterday. Do
you know the island pretty good?

271
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,654
Yeah, well, my dad has
a house out here,

272
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,423
so I'm kind of
stuck here all summer.

273
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,591
You looking for something?

274
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,259
Hidden treasure.

275
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,661
Hidden what?

276
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,762
Treasures, you know.

277
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,966
Cool...
Cool spots on the island.

278
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:38,469
Well, there's a general store in town.
Pretty good ice-cream.

279
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,873
Yeah, yeah, I love...

280
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,309
I love ice-cream.
I can eat ice-cream all day.

281
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,614
All right, see you boys later.

282
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,148
Okay.

283
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:58,022
"I love ice-cream. I could
eat ice-cream all day."

284
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,096
<i>Hidden treasure, lost
fortune, where to begin?</i>

285
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,899
<i>All I had was a rusty
pocket watch and mark.</i>

286
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,469
<i>We decided to kill two birds with
one stone. Get a little ice cream</i>

287
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,572
<i>and explore Walton island.</i>

288
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,241
<i>The whole place looked
like it was going under.</i>

289
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,644
<i>Guess we weren't the only
ones who'd lost everything.</i>

290
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,815
Are you stalking me?

291
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,018
It's an island.
Don't flatter yourself.

292
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,854
Made up your mind yet?

293
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,489
Mint chip, please.
Double scoop.

294
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,327
You boys are Waltons, ain't ya?

295
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,162
Got your grandfather's eyes.

296
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,531
You knew him?

297
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,466
Everyone knew him, hon.

298
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,803
If he was with us,
we could stay in peace.

299
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,571
Instead, we have to start over.

300
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,677
How much
for the ice-cream?

301
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,279
That's $10,000.

302
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,549
But don't worry, miss Broman.
Your father can afford it.

303
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,286
Actually, I'm buying.

304
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,855
In that case, it's on the house.

305
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,059
Thanks.

306
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,396
What are you getting?

307
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,271
Hello, Trent.

308
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,178
I hear you found yourself
some cheap labor.

309
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,347
I got till the end of the summer.
What are you doing here?

310
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,483
Yes, well, that was
the old deal.

311
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:36,854
This one has a 10% bonus

312
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,689
if you move out by
the end of the month.

313
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,995
How about you go to hell?

314
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,699
Oh, Trent, Trent, Trent.

315
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,235
When are you going to learn?

316
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,674
There's no future in
this bait and tackle shop.

317
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:02,413
In a year, this island will be the
premier tourist spot for miles around.

318
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,418
Tell you what. I'm willing
to sweeten the deal.

319
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,087
We're planning on
building a gift store here,

320
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:14,625
and I'm willing to let you run
it for, say, 5% of net profit?

321
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,229
Heck, you could sell quite a
lot of your ships in a bottle.

322
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,943
I think I can make this better.

323
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,078
Yeah.

324
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,220
This is my father's island.

325
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,222
Walton island.

326
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,904
Not for long.

327
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,430
<i>My plan was evolving. Find the
treasure, save the island.</i>

328
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:30,067
<i>Save the island, get the girl.</i>

329
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,105
<i>All those things were
looking really good,</i>

330
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,374
<i>and totally,
completely impossible.</i>

331
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,945
<i>How was I ever gonna
get a girl like that?</i>

332
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,281
Hey, what are those?

333
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,417
That's the west forest.

334
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,056
Your uncle hasn't
told you much, has he?

335
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,959
Those crosses are for the nine
people who vanished there.

336
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,193
What? Come on.

337
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,394
Yeah.

338
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,463
Are they buried there?

339
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,465
No. They were
never found.

340
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:04,969
People have seen some strange
things here. Ghosts.

341
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,404
A haunted forest?

342
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,306
Oh, cool. Finally
something fun to do.

343
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,975
No! No way!

344
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,743
Mark, come on, stop!

345
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,312
Oh, come on, Claire. They're
just ghost stories, okay?

346
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,348
There's nine stakes in
the ground for a reason.

347
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,851
I'm not trying to be 10. You
better get him out of there.

348
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,692
Mark.

349
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,833
Mark!

350
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,138
Mark, come on, man.
Where are you?

351
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,941
Mark!

352
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,986
Andy! Andy, help!

353
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,689
Mark! Mark!

354
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,960
Mark! Mark, where are you?

355
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,632
Dude! Dude! Don't do that.

356
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,334
Where's your girlfriend?

357
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,537
She's not my girlfriend.
Come on, let's go.

358
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:17,141
You know, if I was burying a
treasure, this is where I'd put it.

359
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,076
No, it's gotta have
something to do with time,

360
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,945
like a watch or a clock, maybe.

361
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,582
You don't bury
treasure in a clock.

362
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,650
No, numb-nuts.
It's a metaphor.

363
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:28,485
Andy!

364
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,630
Andy!

365
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,333
Andy!

366
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,168
Andy, are you okay?

367
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,704
Yeah. I think so.

368
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,449
Oh, god! Oh, god!

369
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,921
Andy, what do you want me to do?

370
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:07,091
Go get Trent! Go get uncle Trent.
Hurry!

371
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,892
Okay, okay.

372
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,956
Come on, mark, where are you?
Come on.

373
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,329
"Spooky", she said. "Don't
go in there," she said.

374
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,919
Andy?
Andy, where are you?

375
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,588
Uncle Trent? Hey!

376
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,125
Hey! Hey!
Hey, I'm down here!

377
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,593
All right.
I got you.

378
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,363
All right, all right,
hold on, I'm coming.

379
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,965
Thank god. Thank god.

380
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,339
Do you wanna tell me why you
went into the west forest?

381
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,608
Ask mark.
He's the one who went in.

382
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,077
Ask Andy.
He's the one who thinks

383
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,478
he can find grandpa's treasure.

384
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,915
And Claire
thinks there's ghosts.

385
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,552
How old are you?

386
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,287
Ghosts?

387
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,690
You haven't listened to a thing I
said since you been here, have you?

388
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,092
Have you?

389
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:50,360
You think I just talk
to hear myself speak?

390
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,529
I told you not to
go into the forest.

391
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,565
There's nothing in there,
and there is nothing.

392
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,266
There's not treasure.
There's not ghosts.

393
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,404
Don't go in.

394
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:04,775
Am I clear? I'm not
gonna say this again.

395
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,384
If you want Claire
to like you back,

396
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,487
maybe you should grow
one of your claws bigger.

397
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,089
Dude! Wait, what?

398
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,791
Well, that's what these guys do.

399
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:24,394
You see, the boy lobster grows
one claw bigger than the other,

400
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,263
not even to hunt or anything.

401
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:30,567
It's really just to
impress the girl lobster.

402
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,935
It's true.

403
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,971
You know the most random
crap, you know that?

404
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:37,007
It's not crap. You're just
jealous 'cause you don't...

405
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,108
Hey!

406
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,344
Mark, it's okay.

407
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,578
Andy!

408
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:47,017
Once they get ahold of you
like that, they never let go.

409
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,154
Here, let's have a look.

410
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,189
Oh, you'll survive.

411
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:56,226
Rinse that with cold water and put
a compress on it. You'll be fine.

412
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,597
Thank you.
I didn't know what to do.

413
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:03,066
Well, next time, you will.

414
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,836
There are two kinds of
creatures in this world.

415
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:10,974
The ones that pick a fight,
and the ones that finish it.

416
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,344
This one picked wrong.

417
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,013
John Broman.

418
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,648
Andrew Walton.

419
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,217
Are you any
relation to Richard Walton?

420
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:23,086
Yeah, yeah, he was my grandfather.
You knew him?

421
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,222
No, no, I wish I had.

422
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:29,159
I'm a great admirer of his.
That's why I bought his house.

423
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,328
Oh, you didn't know?

424
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,629
No.

425
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
bring the rest of these over,

426
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,202
and I'll have my chef
cook us a nice dinner tonight.

427
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,336
We'll give you a tour.

428
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,171
What do you say?
Sure.

429
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,708
You're a finisher,
aren't you, Andrew?

430
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,680
I think so.

431
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,682
Don't think so.

432
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,050
Know so.

433
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,119
I never pick wrong.

434
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:01,592
So, uh, shall we say
about 8:00?

435
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,793
Yeah.

436
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,414
Hey.

437
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,018
You sure that's her style?

438
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,595
Her dad invited me
out tonight, so...

439
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,468
Look, I've known
John Broman a long time,

440
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,404
and he's a snake.

441
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,040
Look, I got my
reasons for going.

442
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,280
I bet you do.

443
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,382
Hey.

444
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,385
Good luck, kid.

445
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,623
Thanks.

446
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,929
<i>Luck?
Yeah. Never had much of that.</i>

447
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,698
<i>But what I did have
was a bag full of lobsters,</i>

448
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,801
<i>and I was gonna use
it to get some answers.</i>

449
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,970
<i>If this Broman guy,
that everybody hates,</i>

450
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:22,105
<i>lives in my grandfather's house,</i>

451
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,174
<i>and he's interested in me?</i>

452
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,643
<i>No way that's a coincidence.</i>

453
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,320
<i>If there were answers,
they were here.</i>

454
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,422
<i>They just had to be.</i>

455
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,611
Looking for something?

456
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,448
I was just admiring your clock.

457
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,549
Mmm.

458
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,217
I brought lobster.

459
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,785
Oh, splendid.

460
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,555
Mildred!

461
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,056
Yes, sir.

462
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,158
Have the chef prepare these
for us, will you, please?

463
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,860
Right away.

464
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,429
You know, when you said you were
living in my grandfather's house,

465
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,032
I just thought it was a normal house.
This is beautiful.

466
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,934
Yes, yes, we're very fond of it.

467
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,769
It's like a home away from home.

468
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,106
Right this way.
Okay.

469
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,316
So, how are you enjoying your
time on the island so far?

470
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,918
Have you had a chance
to do any exploring?

471
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,921
You know, a little.

472
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:48,025
I presume you've heard of your
grandfather's lost fortune.

473
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,328
No, I haven't.

474
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,698
Really? My dear boy,
it's legendary.

475
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,601
You mean to tell me your parents
never told you about it?

476
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,140
There was once
a pirate named William Kidd

477
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,442
back in the 17th century.

478
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,110
And apparently, before he died,

479
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:11,715
Kidd buried almost $10 million in
gold somewhere in long island.

480
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:16,720
Your grandfather's hidden treasure
is estimated to be twice that.

481
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,889
Being Richard Walton's grandson,

482
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,660
seems to me that
you're the natural heir.

483
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:27,864
Unfortunately, I'm completely preoccupied
with developing this island,

484
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,734
or else I'd look for it myself.

485
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,135
I'll tell you what.

486
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:35,405
If you discover anything on
my island, it's all yours.

487
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,476
It would appear you have a
treasure hunt ahead of you.

488
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,449
Hello? Yes, hold on.

489
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:48,218
I'm so sorry. I have to take this call.
It's rather private.

490
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,653
Oh, yeah, sure.

491
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,694
Glad to see you made it
out of the forest alive.

492
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:01,832
Oh. You know what?
Here. Got you something.

493
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,133
Just so you don't have to put up

494
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,401
with that
ice-cream lady's attitude

495
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,903
next time you need a fix.

496
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,305
Thanks.

497
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,341
So, my dad and Trent
grew up here. Crazy.

498
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,976
I can't believe
they're tearing it down.

499
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,912
What?

500
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,981
Eighteenth fairway
is going right through here.

501
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,885
That's your grandfather
right there.

502
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,721
Breaks my heart.

503
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,992
I love this house.

504
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,928
Hey, before they tear it down,
I have something to show you.

505
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,602
This is my favorite
room in the house.

506
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,948
Do you play?

507
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,738
"Authentic world
war ii cipher decoder

508
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,806
"used by U.S.
Navy intelligence."

509
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,476
My dad's prize possession.

510
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,479
Basically useless, though.
Try opening it.

511
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,019
Yeah, the only way
is with a key.

512
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,087
Your grandfather's design.

513
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,966
Hardly see my dad all year,

514
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,702
and then he forces me to come
to this island every summer

515
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,605
just so he can sit in his
office and ignore me.

516
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,041
And your parents,
when did they...

517
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,909
When did they split?
Yeah.

518
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,111
Long time ago.

519
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:59,816
My mom got remarried,
new step-kids, new life.

520
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,752
Yeah, I get it.

521
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,957
Sometimes it's lonely
when it feels like...

522
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,959
Nothing fits?

523
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,929
Yeah, but at least
you don't have

524
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,397
your parents breathing
down your neck.

525
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,433
And plus, you're rich. I
would trade you in a second.

526
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:20,537
No, be careful
what you wish for.

527
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,240
You know, no disrespect
or anything,

528
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:27,177
but don't front like
you have it rough, okay?

529
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,547
You have money. You can
pretty much fit anywhere.

530
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,821
Your family was
wealthy once, too.

531
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,623
That house?

532
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,492
It all could've been yours until Trent
lost it to my dad in a card game.

533
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,064
That's impossible.

534
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,441
I'm having the best time ever.

535
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:03,246
I'm learning how to
catch lobster, play poker.

536
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:07,851
Please, can I stay, dad?
I'll do anything. Please?

537
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:11,354
Okay, hey.
Okay, buddy, you can stay.

538
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:14,691
Sounds like you're having fun.
No more poker. Promise.

539
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,726
<i>Put uncle Trent on the phone.</i>

540
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,062
Yes! Thank you!
Love you, dad, bye!

541
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,232
Yeah?

542
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,301
<i>Did you do it yet?</i>

543
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,137
I'm working on it.

544
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,607
<i>How about you stop working on it,
Trent, and you actually do it?</i>

545
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,708
That was the deal.

546
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,743
No, that was your deal,
not mine.

547
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,412
<i>You didn't agree to anything.</i>

548
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,348
<i>How about just once you don't
have to agree and negotiate?</i>

549
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,817
<i>You just take
responsibility for something.</i>

550
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,620
That would be such a miracle
in my little life, Trent,

551
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,622
<i>if you just took
responsibility for something</i>

552
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,557
<i>other than wiping your own butt.</i>

553
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,426
<i>I've been taking
after you your whole life.</i>

554
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:52,929
<i>It must be nice to just, sort of,
like, play footsie with the wind.</i>

555
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,098
<i>What are you teaching 'em
poker for, anyway, hmm?</i>

556
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,666
<i>No more gambling...</i>

557
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,936
What's wrong?

558
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,971
Nothing.
Everything's peachy.

559
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,844
<i>- That was super funny,
- Trent...</i>

560
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,974
<i>I probably should've left well
enough alone and kept on riding,</i>

561
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,677
<i>but time wasn't on my side,
and I needed answers.</i>

562
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,381
<i>These guys were either guarding
something, or looking for something.</i>

563
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,118
<i>Either way, I wasn't alone.</i>

564
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,721
Hey! Stop!

565
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,530
<i>This wasn't just a treasure hunt anymore.
This was a race.</i>

566
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,265
<i>It was time to get serious.</i>

567
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,034
Where's uncle Trent?

568
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,185
<i>A second gold pocket watch?</i>

569
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:24,921
<i>Maybe my luck was
changing after all.</i>

570
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,860
"To my son, Trent.

571
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:34,664
"Here I am revealed after the day
is done and the burning sun sets.

572
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,866
"Yesterday and tomorrow
destined to be your guide,

573
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,302
"ever and always
the constant of constants."

574
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,641
Hey. What are you doing?

575
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,815
It's all I have
left of my father.

576
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,362
Look, Trent, there are
people in the west forest.

577
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,031
Okay, we need to do something.

578
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,098
You went back in that forest?

579
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,401
One of them took a shot at me.

580
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:13,603
They're looking
for something, Trent.

581
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,773
You go back in
that forest again,

582
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,942
consider yourself locked in
your room the rest of the...

583
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,977
Are you not listening to me?

584
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,379
They're gonna tear our
family home to the ground!

585
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,415
And we still got time,
but we are running out.

586
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:29,519
Enough! It is over. I had
told you that already. Stop!

587
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,822
You know what?
Go to your room.

588
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,325
Go to my room.

589
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:41,197
Who do you think
you are, my father?

590
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,434
Or just some guy who
sucks at playing cards?

591
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,039
So, it's true.

592
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,809
Don't go there, kid.

593
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,477
Try me.

594
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,083
Yeah?
Yeah.

595
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:04,120
You know what happens when you
don't pay your property taxes?

596
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,125
The government
seizes everything.

597
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:11,294
And my father, your grandfather,

598
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:14,297
in his infinite genius,
decided to stash his money,

599
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,599
but he forgot to tell
anyone where it was.

600
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,569
So, eventually, all we had left

601
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:22,472
on this whole island
was that house.

602
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:23,773
And they were coming for that.

603
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,509
That was just a matter of time.

604
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,045
So, yes,

605
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,181
I walked into that
poker game with Broman

606
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:35,251
because it was my
last and only play.

607
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,989
And I lost.

608
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,126
I lost everything.

609
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,030
Do you know why you're here?

610
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,971
This.

611
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:57,707
Oh, god... What is this?
What is this?

612
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:00,176
Do you think I ditched my life

613
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:03,346
to build a ship in a bottle
with some deadbeat, broke-down

614
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,715
alcoholic uncle
that I have never met?

615
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:07,383
Would you listen to me for once?
No, no, listen!

616
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:10,019
Okay, you know what? You know what?
Fine, let's do this.

617
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:14,290
Do we just write some little fortune
cookie note and toss it in the ocean,

618
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:19,062
or is that just your excuse
to empty another bottle?

619
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,784
Go away!

620
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,857
Get in, get in.
Close the door.

621
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,295
He told you not to touch that.

622
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,530
No, this is dad's.
I stole it before we left.

623
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,699
My god, you're gonna get
into so much trouble.

624
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,535
What do you think
I'm in now, mark?

625
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,143
It looks exactly
like the other one.

626
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,279
Yeah, I know. The
inscriptions and everything.

627
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,783
"To my son, Jim.

628
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,419
"Unfair and unkind
that soon we must part.

629
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:19,822
"But beginnings are endings,
and endings are beginnings.

630
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,559
"Be ready, for at these
crossroads, I await discovery.

631
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,696
"Seek your reward where
the gift of time awaits."

632
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,466
Where do endings
and beginnings meet?

633
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,605
Midnight!

634
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:38,941
The beginning of a new day
meets the ending of the last.

635
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,777
What did the other
pocket watch say?

636
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:45,581
Something about a guide after
sunset, like a sunset guide.

637
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,284
Oh, that's easy. There's only one
constant guide after sunset.

638
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,853
So, what is it?

639
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,992
I know something you don't.

640
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,427
Come on,
tell me, you little twerp.

641
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:00,363
No, you said you were going
on this hunt, not me.

642
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:04,434
You're don Quixote, and you
don't need a Sancho Panza.

643
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,207
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

644
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,176
We're going on
the hunt together.

645
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:15,445
Promise?

646
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:19,282
Would I lie to you, Sancho?

647
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,652
The north star!

648
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:25,521
The only thing in the night
sky that never, ever moves.

649
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:27,790
Holy ship in a bottle,
I think you're right.

650
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,627
Okay, let's go.
Okay.

651
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,967
You're sure that's
the north star, right?

652
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,969
Yeah, that's it.
Okay.

653
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,838
But what do we do now?

654
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,475
I don't know.
I guess we wait.

655
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,779
And it's

656
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,447
midnight.

657
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,191
Maybe your watch
is a little fast.

658
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,835
Andy, what's past the stars?

659
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,672
Past the stars?

660
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,776
I don't know, mark.

661
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,645
I have a hard enough time
figuring out life down here.

662
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:49,172
Hey, hey, wake up.
We gotta get back.

663
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,410
I don't see why you're so mad.

664
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,579
Well, obviously,
one of us was wrong,

665
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,648
and I'm pretty sure
midnight was right, so...

666
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,650
The north star was right, too.

667
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,418
Maybe we were just
in the wrong place.

668
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,887
Yeah, unless it has nothing
to do with the north star,

669
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:08,024
and I'm just wasting my
time with you, Sancho.

670
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,264
I just need three more days.

671
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:17,900
Yes, I tried
the tactical approach,

672
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:22,138
but there are always
more convincing measures.

673
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,776
He'll leave, and they'll all follow.
Trust me.

674
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:29,478
We can break ground
by the end of the month.

675
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,448
Wanna play some cards?

676
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,283
Hold on one second.

677
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,720
Not now, darling. I'm right
in the middle of something.

678
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:40,489
We will be on time
and on schedule.

679
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,095
<i>Secrets, lies,
and dead-ends.</i>

680
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,297
<i>Even the stars were against me.</i>

681
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,932
<i>We were getting
back pretty late,</i>

682
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,935
<i>but as long as Trent wasn't an
early riser, we'd be in the clear.</i>

683
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,873
<i>No such luck.</i>

684
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,812
Well, thank god.

685
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,095
What the heck?

686
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,131
You really think that you could

687
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,133
stay out all night
without saying anything?

688
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,470
You, too.

689
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:28,905
Me?

690
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,014
Sucks about your ride.

691
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:40,616
For what it's worth, I'd take a
bike over an escalade any day.

692
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:50,459
Look, I just came by
to say that I'm sorry.

693
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,862
I thought you knew
about the poker game.

694
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,837
Wanna come out with
mark and I tonight?

695
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,841
Bonfire on the beach,
sing<i> Kumbaya.</i>

696
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:07,376
I got something for you.

697
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,654
So, what do you got for me?

698
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:20,256
Ah.

699
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,725
Close your eyes.

700
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,160
Okay.

701
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,400
Okay.

702
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,537
I saw you checking
this out earlier.

703
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,406
Maybe we can make a trade.

704
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:40,509
I saw you
checking this out before.

705
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,981
I mean, no offense.

706
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:48,851
I thank you, but I just...
I will never wear that.

707
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:51,754
- I'll take it.
- Yeah?

708
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:59,061
Hey, mark, you see that
lighthouse over there?

709
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:02,164
You know your grandfather
built that, too, right?

710
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,833
You should go check it out.

711
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,401
Yeah, mark,
you should go check it out.

712
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,538
No way.
I've only had one s'more.

713
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,112
Ugh. Fine.

714
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,019
Have fun.

715
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:30,292
So, you and Ryan,
are you guys...

716
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,562
Forget Ryan.

717
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,699
I don't like you like him.

718
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,935
I like you like you.

719
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,400
Yes!

720
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,905
Andy!

721
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,808
You won't believe it!

722
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,476
I...

723
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:22,244
Wait, were you two...

724
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,913
Nothing.
We're nothing.

725
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,849
You were!

726
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,417
You were sitting in a tree!

727
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,053
What did you figure out, mark?
Better be good.

728
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:35,391
The answer to the clue.
It's been here the whole time.

729
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:37,993
Right in front of us.

730
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:40,029
Okay, so what is a Polaris?

731
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:43,833
Polaris, the brightest star in
the night sky, the north star.

732
00:51:43,835 --> 00:51:45,634
On the north tip of the island.

733
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:49,038
Dude, this is the first time I'm
actually stoked that you're a boy scout.

734
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,613
Let me get this straight.

735
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,416
You think your grandfather's
lost fortune is in a lighthouse?

736
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:01,698
There's only one
way to find out.

737
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,258
Come on, come on.

738
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,866
Andy, come on! I wanna go.

739
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:18,834
Hey, Andy, there's
something else down here.

740
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,107
What is this place?

741
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,610
This must be the map room.

742
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,815
Come on, grandpa, where is it?

743
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,918
Isn't "x" supposed
to mark the spot?

744
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,023
No.

745
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,126
But "xii" does.

746
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,463
Here, shine a light.

747
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,468
Polaris at midnight.

748
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,954
"Exceptional work, my sons.

749
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:15,357
"Rest not.
You now hold every clue."

750
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,696
What?

751
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,265
Great.
Grandpa was crazy.

752
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,503
If only we had
the other pocket watch.

753
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:30,306
Dude!

754
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:32,841
You little ninja.

755
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,269
Guys, look!
Check this out!

756
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:13,749
"Use birthday decoder."

757
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,852
The world war ii decoder at your house.
We have to get it.

758
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:20,522
No, no, my dad would kill you if he
caught you even breathing on it.

759
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,524
Plus, it's really far.

760
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,461
Uncle Trent locked
our bikes, remember?

761
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,737
Got enough cash for all your little
minions running around here.

762
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,572
You think we're stupid?

763
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,742
Look, you're not the only ones
with your ass in a sling.

764
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,812
I have developers flying
in from China in 72 hours.

765
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,715
If I can't deliver on my
share, I'm out of the deal.

766
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,818
Out. Do you understand
what that means? Hmm?

767
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,588
Sounds like you're trying to squeeze
a few more nickels for yourself.

768
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,257
Stay here.
I'll get the key.

769
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:30,159
No, no, no,
wait till they leave.

770
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,428
Trust me.
Don't worry.

771
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,096
Hi, daddy.

772
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:35,831
Everything all right?

773
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,566
Yes. Just doing business,
sweetheart.

774
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,335
Do you need me for something?

775
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:43,505
I'm just gonna get the cards, play
some solitaire and then go to bed.

776
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,909
All right, look, I'm asking you

777
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:50,279
to wait a little
while longer, all right?

778
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,047
We're getting close.

779
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,283
Night, daddy.

780
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,193
Good night, sweetheart.

781
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,203
I'll be there in a minute.
Just go.

782
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,371
No, no, we'll wait for you.

783
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,106
We'll all be winners.

784
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,645
Here, here.

785
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,555
Mark, read me
that message, quick.

786
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,124
Okay.

787
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:41,797
"N-d-d-f-space-i."

788
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,766
Look, as I've already told you,

789
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,701
there's a fortune to be
made with this island,

790
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:49,571
and it starts with finding out where
the old man has buried his money.

791
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,073
It's my buy-in.

792
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:55,811
Without it, I have to stand
on the sidelines and watch,

793
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:59,882
so I suggest you get back
out there and find it.

794
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:03,085
"C-o-b-e-b."

795
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,662
Someone's coming.

796
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,569
Go, go, go, go, go!

797
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:27,142
Dude, come on! Don't! What are you...
Come on!

798
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,762
Dad.

799
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:22,698
What are you doing?

800
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,134
You took my key, didn't you?

801
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,803
They're here, aren't they?

802
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:29,438
Oh, my god.

803
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,739
Claire!

804
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,687
Come on.
Pass me the flashlight.

805
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:57,366
Hey, this must be
grandpa's secret passageway.

806
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,237
I hope we don't find
any dead things back here.

807
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,746
Hey, what's that?

808
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,017
Whoa.

809
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,986
You think we're
supposed to take it?

810
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:19,321
I guess.

811
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,327
Let's go.

812
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,098
Hey, this way.

813
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:43,178
My dad's on to you. You guys
need to get out of here now.

814
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,580
Okay, come on.

815
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,300
Okay, let's take
a look at that message.

816
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,768
All right.

817
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,939
"One final step to discover

818
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,241
"a treasure that
will never run dry.

819
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:17,446
"Be warned. What lies beneath
is the root of all evil.

820
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,917
"Look under
the west forest roses."

821
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,186
All right, mark, we can't just
wander into that forest again.

822
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,287
It's time to gear up, okay?

823
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,622
- Walkie-talkies.
- Check.

824
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,657
Lantern.
Check.

825
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,193
I'm asking you to wait
a little while longer.

826
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:33,562
Once this deal goes through,
we'll all be rich.

827
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:35,797
Enough talk.

828
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,166
Open the safe.

829
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,535
Don't be foolhardy, Ridgewick.

830
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:42,404
You know I know how to use this.

831
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:47,209
Years of practice out in that
forest, killing for you.

832
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,444
Open it!

833
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,747
All right, all right.

834
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,384
You want your money?
Here it is.

835
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,331
Don't ever threaten me again.

836
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,869
Get him out of here.
He's bleeding on my rug.

837
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,747
Go get the stuff.
Go, go, go.

838
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:33,755
Uh, I'm sorry I borrowed your
truck, but it's back, so...

839
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,626
I mean, you can hate
me all you want.

840
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,163
I don't hate you, kid.

841
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,700
You're just like me.

842
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:51,273
Wanna know why your dad
doesn't talk to me?

843
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,877
This is way before
I lost the house.

844
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,447
When I was about your age,

845
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:02,384
I stole a bunch of
money from my dad,

846
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,020
and I went to see the world.

847
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:08,423
I wanted to have some fun.

848
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,827
Prodigal son,
the romanticism, that BS.

849
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:18,066
The truth was,
I was selfish, stupid.

850
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,504
Then one night I called home,

851
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:25,607
and he said dad's gone.

852
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,477
Then when I got here,

853
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,847
things were never the same.

854
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:37,753
Well, I'm sure you
did what you could.

855
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:40,455
No. No, I did not.

856
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:45,827
Because my brother needed me,
and I wasn't there.

857
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:53,001
I was searching for
all the wrong things.

858
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:57,205
When you do that, when your
questions are all wrong,

859
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,474
you're just gonna miss
what it's all about.

860
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,478
What what's all about?

861
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,848
The treasure
that never runs dry.

862
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,260
I had my shot, and I blew it.

863
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,998
Don't.

864
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,791
"Backstroke champion,
Trent Walton."

865
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:27,395
"Dear Andy, I'm sorry I can't
be the father you deserve."

866
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,067
"You never should have come.
Forget about me."

867
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:45,513
<i>"Dear Andy, if only I
could find the words,</i>

868
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:47,883
<i>"or find the strength
to reach out to you,</i>

869
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,152
<i>"but I keep telling myself that
we will meet again someday.</i>

870
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:52,921
<i>"Love always, dad."</i>

871
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,124
What is this?

872
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,342
Andy, open up.

873
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:48,576
Andy, let me in!

874
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:51,846
Open up! Hey!

875
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:53,882
Andy!
Andy, don't leave me!

876
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:57,185
Andy, take me with you!
Andy!

877
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,444
Jim, you need to get out here.

878
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,879
<i>Andy's gone.</i>

879
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,371
West forest compass roses.

880
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,057
Two keys.

881
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,304
Yeah.

882
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:42,076
No, no, no, no! No! No!

883
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:48,983
No! Hey! Hey!

884
01:09:50,153 --> 01:09:51,352
Hey! Anybody!

885
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,100
Mark?

886
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,937
Mark, do you read me?
Come in.

887
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:11,372
Mark, it's Andy.
Are you there?

888
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,444
Does anybody read me?

889
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,681
Can anybody read me?

890
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,349
Help!

891
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,864
Trent! Trent.

892
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,734
Claire, what are you doing?

893
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,949
Four days and you lost him
already, on an island?

894
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,418
How'd you manage
that, Trent? Hmm?

895
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,656
Trent, you explain to
me how this happens.

896
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:02,957
He's a 17-year-old kid.

897
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,792
You had one thing to do,
look after him.

898
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,594
Hey, spare me
the parenting advice.

899
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,896
Parent? No, no, you lost
the right to use that word

900
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,266
when you dropped him
on my lap 15 years ago.

901
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:12,667
No, no.
I was his father, not you!

902
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,068
I picked up the pieces.
I was there!

903
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,737
Pour it on,
pour it on, pour it on.

904
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:17,505
You feel sorry for yourself now?
Why don't you grow up?

905
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:19,440
You had the chance.
You didn't want to do that.

906
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:22,143
You brought him here! You
brought him here, not me!

907
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:24,145
Have a drink, Trent. He was not
supposed to know about me.

908
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:25,280
Enough!
None!

909
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:27,148
Enough!

910
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:30,585
Trent, you know the island.

911
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,453
Where could he have gone?

912
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,855
I know.

913
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:43,197
They're not just watches.
They're riddles.

914
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,767
Your father left
you both a message.

915
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:50,538
I never knew there were two.

916
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,874
The answers lead to
your father's fortune.

917
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,976
That's where they went.

918
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,544
What do you mean,
that's where they went?

919
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:57,612
Claire.

920
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,884
Where are they?

921
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:05,186
<i>They went to the west forest.</i>

922
01:12:05,188 --> 01:12:08,056
<i>He took my truck. We'll
need to get there by boat.</i>

923
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,864
If anybody's listening,

924
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,669
this is Andrew Walton,

925
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:26,607
son of Trent Walton,

926
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:32,113
brother to no one.

927
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,684
And now I'm here,

928
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:43,157
underground,
where nobody can find me.

929
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:47,795
I made it all this way
for a dead end.

930
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,236
A dead end.

931
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:09,050
<i>Andy, come in.
What's your 10-9?</i>

932
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,720
Mark? Mark, is that you?

933
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,857
Mark! Mark!
That's you!

934
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:17,458
<i>Andy, where the heck are you?</i>

935
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,794
I'm underneath you.
I'm underneath you.

936
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:22,797
Do you see the remote that we stole
from Broman's? Do you see it?

937
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:24,298
<i>The black flashy thing?</i>

938
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,801
Yes! Yes!
Okay, push the button.

939
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,272
Mark! Mark?

940
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:33,775
Andy!
Mark!

941
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,210
You came for me.

942
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,415
Why did you leave without me?

943
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,852
I found out why I've never
heard of uncle Trent.

944
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,156
I saw the bottles.

945
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,560
Hey, hey.

946
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,030
So what?

947
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,834
No matter what Trent wrote,

948
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:02,403
we'll always be brothers.

949
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:15,316
Now, come on, brother,
let's see what's down there.

950
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:18,753
No. Mark, mark, it's a dead end.
Mark!

951
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,203
You know my favorite time
I remember being your brother?

952
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,373
The time we went on
this crazy treasure hunt

953
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:43,344
that led us to
a cave holding millions.

954
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:45,780
Till we got stuck 'cause
we were missing a key.

955
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:48,616
Well, that's not how
I remember it.

956
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:57,592
Well, only one way to find out.

957
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,361
Okay, ready?

958
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:04,398
Three, two, one.

959
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:15,676
Whoa!

960
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,891
Organ pipes?

961
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,528
It's just for spooks.

962
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:36,464
But why?

963
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,303
That's why.

964
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:44,272
It's a mine, mark.

965
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,610
It's a gold mine.

966
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,782
That is what he meant
when he said,

967
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,317
"a treasure that
would never run dry."

968
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,967
Look! There's a way out!

969
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,815
If the fall didn't kill you...

970
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,550
Those currents would
certainly do the rest.

971
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,454
Come on.

972
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,829
This is a nice one.

973
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,837
"Broman."

974
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:51,806
"Broman."

975
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:55,476
Broman. He found out there
was gold on this island.

976
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,253
"Trent and Jim."

977
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,794
"Boys, if you're reading this,

978
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,363
"you're together again,
and you've discovered

979
01:17:15,365 --> 01:17:20,034
"the real treasure
that will never run dry, love.

980
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:22,637
"Take care of each other, dad.

981
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:26,207
"P.S. You're rich."

982
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:31,278
Nice job, boys, but I believe
your work here is done.

983
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,649
Step aside.

984
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,199
You have to
appreciate the irony.

985
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:57,872
Richard Walton's grandsons lead me
to the treasure I could never find,

986
01:17:57,874 --> 01:18:02,910
and now I'm going to use it to
sweep his family aside for good.

987
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:07,314
What is your deal? What is your
vendetta against my family?

988
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:09,583
Your grandfather cheated me.

989
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,854
I processed all of his gold,

990
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,825
and never once did he
cut me into the deal.

991
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:23,364
I made him rich,
and he gave me nothing.

992
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:27,368
He didn't just disappear,
did he?

993
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,838
You certified all the gold
that he brought in,

994
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,207
so you followed
him out one night,

995
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,543
<i>probably foggy, nobody around,</i>

996
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:39,246
and you made sure that
nobody ever found his body.

997
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,620
Well, that's
an outrageous accusation

998
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:49,123
and one that will
never hold up in court.

999
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,338
What have you done?

1000
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,611
"Riches you may possess,

1001
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:14,415
"but only the hand of a Walton
shall Grant release."

1002
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:15,783
What does that mean?

1003
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,189
What does it mean?

1004
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,391
Tell me!

1005
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,605
What's this?

1006
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,976
Is this the key to
getting us out of here?

1007
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,149
You know what
the funny thing is?

1008
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:51,018
Only one of us knows
how to use that thing.

1009
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,420
The other doesn't have a clue.

1010
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:56,857
Enough. I'm not
asking you to open it.

1011
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:58,926
I'm telling you.

1012
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:02,296
No, Broman.
I'm telling you.

1013
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:07,468
You have screwed over my
family for three generations.

1014
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,970
Now your run ends here.

1015
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,339
It ends with us.

1016
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:15,109
That's very brave,
taking a stand.

1017
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:18,179
Unfortunately, that's
not how you negotiate.

1018
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:22,449
This is how you negotiate.

1019
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,690
You can't shoot me.

1020
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,759
You need the hand of a Walton.

1021
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:35,930
True.

1022
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:39,033
But I only need one.

1023
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,102
Mark!

1024
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:02,323
You picked wrong.

1025
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,171
Oh, god!

1026
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:30,851
Trent, there's
something in the water!

1027
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:32,052
There!

1028
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,121
There! You see it?
Something there?

1029
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,023
Andy!

1030
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:42,630
Andy! Andy!

1031
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,132
Andy, help!

1032
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:46,700
There!

1033
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:48,202
Help me! Help!

1034
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,705
You gotta slow down!

1035
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:53,140
Help me!

1036
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,962
He went down!
He went under!

1037
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,898
Take the wheel.
Take the wheel!

1038
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,170
We're not gonna be able
to swim to the surface,

1039
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:25,372
so you're gonna
have to pull us up.

1040
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:27,167
Come on, come on!
Come on!

1041
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:31,005
Come on! Wake up! Wake up!
Come on! Come on!

1042
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:32,473
Come on!

1043
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:35,642
Who do you think
you are, my father?

1044
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,278
Come on, wake up!

1045
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:44,585
I was searching for
all the wrong things.

1046
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:48,222
When you do that, you're just
gonna miss what it's all about.

1047
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,135
I had my shot, and I blew it.

1048
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,162
I wish I was better with words.

1049
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:42,169
I was just so messed up
when your mom got sick.

1050
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,607
I was lost.
Just, uh...

1051
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:55,549
And then Jim and Sally
stepped in, thankfully.

1052
01:25:57,018 --> 01:26:01,388
I figured you were
better off if I was dead.

1053
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,925
And I was.

1054
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:08,362
And then you came.

1055
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:17,404
I guess I don't understand.
I mean...

1056
01:26:17,406 --> 01:26:19,540
Why go through
the trouble of writing

1057
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,642
all those letters
and never send them?

1058
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:28,148
I guess I thought that if I
wrote 'em and sent 'em out,

1059
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,484
somehow you'd feel me.

1060
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,588
The idea of it anyway.

1061
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:38,325
I'm not an idea.

1062
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,161
I'm right here.

1063
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:44,865
So, if you wanna
love me, then love me.

1064
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:53,740
Okay.

1065
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:13,860
<i>That day,
it was finally clear to me,</i>

1066
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:18,565
<i>that my grandfather had put
together the final treasure hunt</i>

1067
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:22,903
<i>just to bring his sons
back together again,</i>

1068
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:28,976
<i>to see the Waltons side by side,</i>

1069
01:27:28,978 --> 01:27:32,246
<i>sharing the treasure
that never runs dry.</i>
