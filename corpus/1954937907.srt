1
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:53,514
Carolyn upstairs?

2
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:54,915
Yeah.

3
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:56,917
She told me she feels like
she's living at the zoo

4
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:59,419
when you do that.

5
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,753
Like a bear.

6
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:02,788
Oh, a lion.

7
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,559
Don't forget about tonight.

8
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,462
No, I have an interview before,
but I will come straight home.

9
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,436
For the record,
that's a lion, Carolyn!

10
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:33,080
You caught the
seaweed in your mouth!

11
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:35,248
Oh, we have a new champion!

12
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,015
Oh!

13
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,616
Oh, Mommy look!

14
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:38,516
Did you see?

15
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:39,950
I caught the seaweed!

16
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:41,484
We won!

17
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,786
I didn't see it coming.

18
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:47,055
She vanished, he vanished.

19
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:54,094
He'd been seeing
a doctor downtown.

20
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,229
It seemed to help him.

21
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,697
He had been so depressed.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,334
And then one day he was gone.

23
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,572
This doctor had taken
a number of patients

24
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,707
and gone to Glass Lake.

25
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,009
How many patients?

26
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,478
Uh, 10, maybe 15.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,515
When I had just showed up, boy
they were not happy about that.

28
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:24,752
And Anthony said that
he wasn't coming back.

29
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:26,386
He said that after
Jenny's death,

30
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:30,889
he couldn't face the world
away from this place.

31
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,457
What did he mean by that?

32
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:39,196
Did you contact the police?

33
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:41,131
They said no law
had been broken.

34
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:46,301
I feel something
horrible will happen.

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,471
Something horrible's
always a possibility now.

36
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,674
But if you know
it's going to happen,

37
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,809
shouldn't you try to stop it?

38
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,651
Sorry.

39
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,260
Tom?

40
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:24,229
I know, I know, I just
got stuck in an interview.

41
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:27,599
What are you doing?

42
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:30,268
I know, I'll just... I'm
sorry, just two minutes,

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,402
I'll be right back.

44
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:33,284
I called to say
we're not coming.

45
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:38,206
Why?

46
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,540
Everybody knows I work late.

47
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,575
Come on, it'll be fun.

48
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,745
Why are you being such a...

49
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:47,979
Drop it, Alice!

50
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,915
Fucking drop it!

51
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:51,917
Tom.

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,387
You know, you can be a
real asshole sometimes.

53
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,261
I'm going for a walk.

54
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:28,979
Fred, hi, sorry I couldn't
get back to the office.

55
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,647
No, no, I mean... her
husband left her,

56
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,348
she found him at some
clinic, and she's

57
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,283
convinced the place is evil.

58
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:36,852
Yeah, I don't really think
there's a story there.

59
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,253
Yeah, that's OK.

60
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,754
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

61
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:00,671
Tom?

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,973
Tom, I'm back.

63
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:06,975
You hungry?

64
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,978
Game four

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,512
of the American
League championshp

66
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,048
series... is there a fight
left in the New York Yankees?

67
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,350
The setbacks...

68
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,352
Tom?

69
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:44,071
Tom?

70
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:44,672
I'm sorry!
I'm... I'm sorry!

71
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,990
Sure, get ahead of you.

72
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:04,028
Luke, you all right?

73
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,630
You on the wagon, or something?

74
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:10,967
You look kinda sad,
just sitting there.

75
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:11,969
Want to spark it?

76
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:17,373
Be right back.

77
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,407
Do you want to spark it?

78
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:20,308
What kind of question is that?

79
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,910
What kind of question is that?

80
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:00,645
No, no, no... we'll take
a cab, we'll take a cab.

81
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,279
We'll pick up the
car in the morning.

82
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,249
It's not a big deal,
it's not a big...

83
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,886
Zak, look at me!

84
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,842
You OK?

85
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:00,963
What the fuck?

86
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
My baby?

87
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,850
I want to see my baby.

88
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,585
I want to see Tasha.

89
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,586
Don't budge, don't move.

90
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:31,722
We're gonna get you out.

91
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:35,459
Everything's going
to be all right.

92
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:38,494
Fucking shit, fucking waste
of fucking.

93
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,231
Fuck you, fucking
shit, fucking cunt!

94
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:46,667
You fuckin' hole, you fuckin'
hole, fuck you in your hole!

95
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,435
Fuck you in your fucking eye!

96
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,370
Fuck you, you fuck!

97
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:51,003
Gordon!

98
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,704
Fuck!

99
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:55,273
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

100
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:56,275
Fuck you!

101
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,278
Is that Wayne?

102
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,078
That's Wayne!

103
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,045
Wayne!

104
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:06,713
Wayne, hey!

105
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,514
We were just talking about you.

106
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,315
I can believe it.

107
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:12,550
You OK?

108
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:16,086
Oh, you're not pissed
about New Year's?

109
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,353
You're pissed.

110
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,587
Come on, honey.

111
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,790
No, he's pissed.

112
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,726
I don't know who you are.

113
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:28,729
I should know, but I don't.

114
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,431
I'm James, and this is Sheila.

115
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,565
Oh yeah, yeah.

116
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,038
I don't know where I am.

117
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,041
Where am I?

118
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:46,176
Let's... why don't
you come with us?

119
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,218
Let's take you home.

120
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,247
Come on, come on!

121
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,014
Hey!

122
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,016
OK!

123
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,215
Ah!

124
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,783
Ah!

125
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,785
No!

126
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,753
Jenny!

127
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:39,754
Help!

128
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:41,155
Help!

129
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,123
Help!

130
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:49,461
What is it?

131
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:32,198
When I had just showed up,
they were not happy about that.

132
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,367
And, uh, Anthony said that
he wasn't coming back.

133
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,302
He said that after
Jenny's death,

134
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:42,306
he couldn't face the world
away from this place.

135
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:47,877
When I showed just showed up,
they were not happy about that.

136
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,946
And Anthony said that
he wasn't coming back.

137
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,347
He said that after
Jenny's death,

138
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,716
he couldn't face the world
away from this place.

139
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,119
Where?

140
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,887
Uh, near Glass Lake.

141
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,422
But you don't know what
kind of clinic it is?

142
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:05,590
Hmm, find out.

143
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:08,359
There's no story there,
you said that yourself.

144
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,481
Well, maybe I was wrong.

145
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,299
We're not going to pay for it.

146
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:18,366
Fred...

147
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,248
You need to take
time to grieve.

148
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:26,540
Well, what do you
know about grief?

149
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,375
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,443
This is bull shit.

151
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:31,445
Alice...

152
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:32,362
May I help you?

153
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,901
What are you doing here?

154
00:16:39,903 --> 00:16:41,402
Um, I was walking
by the tracks.

155
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:44,438
I saw your chimney.

156
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,480
Where are you going?

157
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,079
Who are you?

158
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,317
I don't know.

159
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,021
Well you should keep on going.

160
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,322
You don't want to be here.

161
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:14,395
And be careful on the
tracks... walk off to one side.

162
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,667
Hey, babies.

163
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,671
Hey... good babies.

164
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
Charlie!

165
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:00,194
Charlie, get back here!

166
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:03,630
Charlie!

167
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:04,632
Jesus, Charlie!

168
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,023
You're not Charlie.

169
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,126
And you're Betsy.

170
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:42,029
Tell me you're Betsy,
for Christ's sake.

171
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:45,565
I'm Betsy.

172
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,133
Put your bags down.

173
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:03,481
What are we doing?

174
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,483
Here.

175
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,719
The boy was good at this.

176
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:12,721
Charlie?

177
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,622
I can show you a trick.

178
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:29,699
Here, it's like the
shoulders of a jacket.

179
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,701
See?

180
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,075
What?

181
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:44,444
I don't know.

182
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:49,081
Oh, Wayne... who
the fuck are you?

183
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,651
Who is this, Wayne?

184
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,653
Betsy.

185
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:03,992
She came over the tracks.

186
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:04,994
From where?

187
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,764
So what did you guys talk about?

188
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:12,999
I told her to go away.

189
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:15,901
That was good advice.

190
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,335
Why didn't you follow it?

191
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:18,836
How did she get past the dogs?

192
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,505
Nobody gets past the dogs.

193
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,507
You see the dogs?

194
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:28,611
You always travel with no ID?

195
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,715
You know what an ID is?

196
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:39,219
Yeah, well, where's yours?

197
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:43,342
That's not a
rhetorical question.

198
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:51,062
Why are you so mean?

199
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,264
I don't know who I am.

200
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:55,933
I don't know how I got here,
and I don't know who you are,

201
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,975
but I wish you'd stop
being such a shit.

202
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,209
OK.

203
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:16,211
We'll feed her, give her $50,
and drop her at the station.

204
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:17,984
I want to stay.

205
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:18,951
Why?

206
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:20,686
Do you like being abused?

207
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:22,220
I can do laundry.

208
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:23,754
Come on, it's pathetic.

209
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:27,190
We could call the police,
hand her over to them.

210
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:32,294
That's just what we
need, Tony... fucking cops.

211
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:35,764
So who's going to take
her to the station?

212
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,232
No, no, no, please no.

213
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,100
I just want to stay
here with you, please!

214
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:40,634
Please, I just want
to stay here with you.

215
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:42,535
I can't go back to...
you have to let me stay.

216
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,303
I can't go back
out there... please,

217
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:47,372
you have to just... I
just want to stay here with you,

218
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:52,210
Please, I just want to be
here. Anything but that.

219
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:54,378
Please just let me stay
here with you guys.

220
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,582
I just... please, please,
I don't know what...

221
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,350
Sshh, it's OK.

222
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:07,222
Here, here, here, here, here.

223
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:11,125
Take it easy, take it easy, OK?

224
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,026
Now drink it.

225
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:16,262
You'll feel better.

226
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:17,264
OK.

227
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,945
I want to
see elbows and assholes!

228
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,980
Elbows and assholes!

229
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:39,948
Everybody up!

230
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,183
I want to see
elbows and assholes!

231
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:56,661
Here you go, darlin'.

232
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:59,964
Neal wants to see you before
he goes to the market.

233
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,732
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

234
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:31,237
Comforters, they're
making the comforters.

235
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:40,098
I spoke with the
folks here about you

236
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,334
staying with us,
for now that is,

237
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:48,838
and I think they'll
be OK with it.

238
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,872
Thank you.

239
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:52,808
Don't thank me, yet.

240
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,645
You know, it's been said
that our humanity lies

241
00:24:56,647 --> 00:25:01,949
in what we've done, and
what we've experienced.

242
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:03,831
Have you ever
thought about that?

243
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:09,388
If you believe
that... I do... then

244
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,156
it might go without
saying that if you

245
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:13,158
strip a person of
their experience,

246
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,792
they become destructive.

247
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:21,932
So you need to remember yours.

248
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:29,405
The people here are in the
last stages of their recovery,

249
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:34,543
and they know very well from
what they're recovering.

250
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:38,046
So you're going to have
to remember something

251
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,647
about what happened
to you, or I'm

252
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:47,649
wildly irresponsible for letting
you stay... for both our sakes.

253
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
That's Charlie.

254
00:25:58,296 --> 00:25:59,296
You understand?

255
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:08,603
So... OK.

256
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:10,171
All right, then.

257
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:16,476
So we'll get you back
and you can meet people.

258
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:20,546
And then you can work
the kitchen tonight.

259
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:27,418
Charlie, this is the young woman
that showed up last evening.

260
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,087
She doesn't remember her name.

261
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,129
And this is Charlie.

262
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,028
Charlie, would you... why
don't you bring her back

263
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,030
and introduce her?

264
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:46,801
Good.

265
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,415
Why don't you just go
back the way you came.

266
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:14,022
You can do that,
don't you think Alice?

267
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:28,901
Do you want to quilt
sewn by one of those.

268
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:30,702
God, no.

269
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,438
Do you want me to be
sewing your clothes?

270
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,307
Honey, you can sew
my quilt anytime.

271
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,008
Does anyone have
left-handed scissors?

272
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,209
Honey, we don't.

273
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,243
You struggling?

274
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:42,011
Oh, honey, I'm sorry I don't.

275
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,712
Oh, Julie.

276
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:48,482
Have you noticed that not one
man has volunteered to do this.

277
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:51,284
Would you want them to?

278
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,386
Could you imagine Neal?

279
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,855
We have a new helper here.

280
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:59,122
Oh, I know who you are.

281
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,057
Come on over here, honey.

282
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,893
We can use all the
help we can get.

283
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:10,698
I thought there were
no more newcomers.

284
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,801
I wasn't just
talking about her.

285
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:20,140
Now, this is Anthony's, and
you can just cut strips out

286
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:21,274
of this old sheet.

287
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,808
I mean, it's easy.

288
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,245
I mean, I know she might
not know who she is,

289
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,879
but can you talk?

290
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,046
Jesus, Julie.

291
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:31,914
Give her a break.

292
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,882
I can talk.

293
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:37,952
Oh, I'm know how to use words,
but you don't know who you are.

294
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,486
Julie, you don't know anything.

295
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:43,956
I know one thing... this sucks.

296
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:47,992
Wait a minute... wait a minute!

297
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,227
Oh, you're kidding.

298
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,462
I can feel it coming.

299
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:54,830
Hillary, no...

300
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:06,805
Julie's sulking.

301
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,807
Go to hell.

302
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,775
Oh, Jules.

303
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,085
Come on, young
lady... give it a try.

304
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:26,054
Come on... you can do it.

305
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,691
She's a keeper!

306
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:56,647
Now, who's this?

307
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,950
It's a mystery, Wayne.

308
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,454
No, it's Betsy.

309
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,022
Huh... isn't it?

310
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:13,226
Luke here was just telling
us about the first time

311
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,895
he was kissed.

312
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:20,365
Watching a basketball
game, it's just so romantic.

313
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,066
No, man... we
fucking took a vote.

314
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:23,400
We said no more.

315
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:25,335
You said that was it...
she can't fucking stay!

316
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:26,736
All right, sit down, Charlie!

317
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,270
You said that was fucking it!

318
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:29,137
Fuck that!

319
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:29,837
Cool down, Charlie.

320
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,073
Fuck you!

321
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,075
Sit down, Gordon.

322
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,577
Cool down, asshole.

323
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,978
You guys... sit down, Gordon!

324
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:45,782
He's right, though, Neil.

325
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:47,817
Charlie's crazy, but
he's right so this one.

326
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,618
We don't know
anything about her.

327
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,919
Let's don't talk
about this now.

328
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,221
We just don't have
the time or the energy

329
00:30:53,223 --> 00:30:56,023
to go through the process that
we've all been going through.

330
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,392
Please, not now.

331
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:01,094
OK, if you just... please.

332
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,195
I agree.

333
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,997
What happened?

334
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:07,432
It's Gordon and Charlie.

335
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,534
Like brothers.

336
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:12,370
I had all brothers.

337
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:15,373
They'd bring their
friends home from school,

338
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,843
and they'd go to
all of my underwear.

339
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,811
I did that once.

340
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:27,950
Not yours... not your underwear,
but a sister of a friend.

341
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,553
They have this laundry chute
with these two little doors...

342
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:34,088
one from the bedroom,
one from the bathroom.

343
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,091
If you kept them both
open, you could spy

344
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:40,194
on Jack's sister taking a bath.

345
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,930
We got into so much trouble.

346
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:43,897
Oh!

347
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:45,832
Son of a bitch!

348
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,439
Now, you sit down.

349
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:56,407
Holy fuck!

350
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,409
Charlie, fuck!

351
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,978
Charlie, fuck!

352
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,379
Get away from me!

353
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,513
Get the fuck back!

354
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:06,314
Blow the stupid
whistle, Charlie!

355
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:07,348
Blow the fucking whistle!

356
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,350
Blow the whistle Charlie!

357
00:32:09,352 --> 00:32:12,353
Blow the fucking
whistle, Charlie!

358
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,556
Thank you, mother
fucker, thank you!

359
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:52,756
Do you mind finishing up here?

360
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:56,559
We're almost done, so...

361
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,193
It's no problem.

362
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:10,138
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,809
It's OK, I'll finish up.

364
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:38,228
You want coffee?

365
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:44,165
Yeah, I'd love some.

366
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,366
How do you take it?

367
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:46,800
Just black.

368
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:50,270
Black like my heart.

369
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:51,432
Give that a rinse, please.

370
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:55,673
There you go.

371
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:56,773
I'll be back.

372
00:34:28,872 --> 00:34:30,739
You have something
you want to say to me?

373
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:33,441
You believe in
cause and effect?

374
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:35,509
It's like when something
happens and then

375
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:37,177
that's just...
that's just who you

376
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,811
are for the rest of
your shitty life.

377
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:41,613
Do you believe in that?

378
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,581
You're a fucking cunt, Alice.

379
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,316
These are decent
people, and they're not

380
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:46,617
messing with anybody.

381
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,352
And you're not going
to mess it up for them.

382
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,252
No, that is not true.

383
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,386
I like everyone here.

384
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,253
Oh yeah, you like
everybody here?

385
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,520
Yes.

386
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:53,721
Yeah, fucking Luke
stabbed his best friend,

387
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:56,623
you fucking like him?

388
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,191
I like you.

389
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,626
You don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:03,261
You're wrong.

391
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:04,263
You are...

392
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,168
Oh, fuck.

393
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,202
Oh, man.

394
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,147
Not here... no, not here.

395
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,630
Hey, cinnamon
girl... where are you?

396
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,233
It's just Gordon.

397
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:19,549
I'll go out...
I'll go out first.

398
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:20,551
OK?

399
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:23,685
Hey, Alice...

400
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:34,294
Thank you.

401
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,987
Sorry, I let myself in.

402
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:11,327
It's all right.

403
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:12,494
Will you sit?

404
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:37,478
Listen to me... when they ask
you if you remember anything,

405
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,687
do not say a word.

406
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:41,921
Do you understand?

407
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,467
I- I'm going to die here.

408
00:38:56,469 --> 00:39:00,070
But it doesn't matter, because
I'm going to die anyway.

409
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:04,974
I'm sick, I'm very sick.

410
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,510
But you're not.

411
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:14,482
All these people... they're
all going to kill themselves.

412
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:19,253
And you want to do that?

413
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:22,789
Do you?

414
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:33,431
Trust me, you don't.

415
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:07,564
What's going on here?

416
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:10,333
We're building beds.

417
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:13,903
They're a little
small, aren't they?

418
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:15,537
Then they're just right.

419
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,539
You want to try one?

420
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,907
No, it's OK.

421
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:23,410
Here, come.

422
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:24,412
OK.

423
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:33,952
They're not soft.

424
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:38,388
It's going to be
nice though, right?

425
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:46,661
Here, put these on.

426
00:40:57,906 --> 00:40:59,039
Now sing.

427
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:05,810
Just sing along with the song.

428
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:07,511
Oh, no, I can't sing.

429
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:09,679
I don't even know the song.

430
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:12,615
Trust me, it feels good.

431
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:12,406
It's good practice.

432
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:15,409
Helps you focus.

433
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,777
Sure.

434
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:20,046
But for what?

435
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:21,380
To let go.

436
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:25,983
Of what?

437
00:42:30,154 --> 00:42:33,322
Can I have those back?

438
00:42:33,324 --> 00:42:34,324
Sorry.

439
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,922
Why haven't you
told anyone else?

440
00:42:58,546 --> 00:43:01,447
You know who I am.

441
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,816
I figured you'd
do that yourself.

442
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:58,065
Charlie, what are you doing?

443
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:01,401
He just drank out of the.

444
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:03,970
That's nasty..

445
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:05,338
Good morning.

446
00:44:28,696 --> 00:44:32,664
I got it!

447
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:37,568
That's a penalty!

448
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,136
Kick it in!

449
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:39,769
Shoot!

450
00:44:39,771 --> 00:44:40,836
Shoot!

451
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:42,671
Nice and easy!

452
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,640
I got it, hon.

453
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:51,879
Oh, Charlie, learn
to walk, buddy!

454
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:52,846
You see that?

455
00:44:52,848 --> 00:44:55,014
Everybody see that?

456
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,389
Pick 'em up.

457
00:45:08,926 --> 00:45:10,893
Shoot!

458
00:45:22,738 --> 00:45:23,704
She's a keeper.

459
00:45:23,706 --> 00:45:24,971
She is a keeper.

460
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:25,838
We won, Charlie.

461
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,939
I'm sorry, you suck.

462
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:31,810
I think we've got a
ringer there, Neil.

463
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,812
Well played.

464
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:36,681
You played.

465
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:38,949
I guess.

466
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:40,884
You played.

467
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:43,419
All right,
let's get ready for dinner.

468
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,302
Wayne, did you forgot about me?

469
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:05,704
Do you remember
my request, Wayne?

470
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:09,440
Gordon?

471
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:11,909
Could you get everyone's
attention for me, please?

472
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:13,076
I have something
I'd like to say.

473
00:46:13,078 --> 00:46:14,243
Right now?

474
00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:15,777
Uh, please.

475
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:17,178
Absolutely.

476
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,346
Everybody listen up, listen up.

477
00:46:19,348 --> 00:46:23,249
My sister here of the
great leg has something

478
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:24,583
she would like to say.

479
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:25,917
Just for the record, I
taught her everything

480
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,718
she knows... you better
fucking believe that.

481
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,020
Why don't you just get
a, Gordon?

482
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:33,722
Eat a fat dick, sir.

483
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,989
Here she goes.

484
00:46:39,027 --> 00:46:40,861
Thank you.

485
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:47,867
Uh, I just wanted to say
I remembered my name.

486
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:49,401
My name is Alice.

487
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,806
Actually, I've
known it all along.

488
00:46:56,808 --> 00:47:01,443
I was pretending not to,
but I'm ashamed of that

489
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:05,013
because I think all of
you deserve much better.

490
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:16,122
Partly, though I don't
know what Alice means.

491
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,556
I don't really know who I am.

492
00:47:17,558 --> 00:47:22,694
I... I feel things since Tom
died, but I don't really

493
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:25,329
know them.

494
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:27,331
I don't know if that
makes any sense.

495
00:47:30,968 --> 00:47:35,570
Almost all the time when I'm
by myself I think about Tom...

496
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:39,439
crammed in that tub, he was
really just too big for it.

497
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:43,208
And um, in his suit.

498
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,077
He had the one suit.

499
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,999
Called himself the
last gentleman.

500
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:53,816
And the mess, oh, the mess.

501
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:56,485
And that gun... I didn't
even know he had it.

502
00:47:56,487 --> 00:48:00,755
Um, I didn't even he was...

503
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:05,092
Anyways, I keep wondering if
I'd done something differently,

504
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:09,228
if I hadn't walked out
that night after we fought,

505
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,796
maybe something
would be different.

506
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:13,198
But I don't know.

507
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Maybe.

508
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:21,037
Who is Tom?

509
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,079
Tom was my boyfriend.

510
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:28,977
I was interviewing
your wife that night.

511
00:48:28,979 --> 00:48:30,111
It's, um, why we fought.

512
00:48:30,113 --> 00:48:31,745
I was late coming home.

513
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,221
I'm a journalist.

514
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:43,889
Oh, dear god.

515
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:46,124
I lied to myself
that I was coming here

516
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:49,227
to investigate a story.

517
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:50,795
I'm not here for that story.

518
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:59,803
Please, I would... I would
very much like to stay.

519
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:18,153
Alice... Alice, that's right?

520
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,854
Yes, I'm Alice.

521
00:49:22,257 --> 00:49:24,891
You know what we're
doing here, right?

522
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:31,730
Do you agree with us?

523
00:49:36,868 --> 00:49:39,569
Uh, yes.

524
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:41,451
Because most of
humanity doesn't.

525
00:49:44,874 --> 00:49:48,943
People are disappointed,
horrible things happen.

526
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:57,483
And they move on, and go
on living all the time.

527
00:49:57,485 --> 00:50:04,022
And they'd find us diminishing
and absurd, fraudulent.

528
00:50:04,024 --> 00:50:06,124
And it's OK to feel that way.

529
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:07,225
It's OK.

530
00:50:07,227 --> 00:50:08,227
You understand?

531
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:18,601
So do you still
want to stay here?

532
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:34,749
Yeah, I do.

533
00:50:40,855 --> 00:50:47,760
OK, so you should take
your dinner with you,

534
00:50:47,762 --> 00:50:50,229
and I'll come and find
you when we're done.

535
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:20,024
Why?

536
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:28,563
I like it here.

537
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,282
Well, the folks here have
voted for you to stay.

538
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:55,720
We're all out of our
minds, of course,

539
00:51:55,722 --> 00:51:57,188
but you already knew that.

540
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:04,427
Thank you.

541
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:05,628
Why not?

542
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:20,308
Don't let her stay, Neil.

543
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,976
It's not right!

544
00:52:21,978 --> 00:52:23,143
It's her decision.

545
00:52:23,145 --> 00:52:24,544
You should know better.

546
00:52:24,546 --> 00:52:27,413
Have you seen the way
she looks at Charlie?

547
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:30,182
Seems to me she's
made up her mind.

548
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:48,058
What kind of things?

549
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,361
When I'm having a
good day, like today,

550
00:53:51,363 --> 00:53:54,831
I remember a lot about my wife.

551
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,365
She was pretty, my wife.

552
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:59,534
You know, like you.

553
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,135
Is she still?

554
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:07,073
Do you have kids?

555
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:09,341
I have photos.

556
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:12,310
Ah, Jesus Christ... stop it!

557
00:54:12,312 --> 00:54:13,544
What?

558
00:54:13,546 --> 00:54:14,444
It's supposed to be
refreshing, right?

559
00:54:14,446 --> 00:54:15,878
You're a... you're a...

560
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,112
A what?

561
00:54:17,114 --> 00:54:19,154
Not that way, Wayne,
it's the other way.

562
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:33,960
Asshole is the word
he's looking for.

563
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:53,536
Will anybody notice the light?

564
00:55:57,707 --> 00:55:59,274
They'll think it's just me.

565
00:56:20,862 --> 00:56:23,496
How long have you been here?

566
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:27,833
15 minutes.

567
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:35,473
No, I mean here with everybody.

568
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,842
I, uh, I met Neil awhile ago.

569
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:40,377
I was one of the first
ones at the clinic.

570
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:48,951
Why were you at the clinic?

571
00:56:48,953 --> 00:56:53,855
Uh, because I was
fucked up, again.

572
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:55,223
How fucked up?

573
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,994
What's with all the questions?

574
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:04,296
I didn't ask you
about Tom, did I?

575
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:07,965
Maybe you should.

576
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:14,104
I didn't exactly
get to question him.

577
00:57:14,106 --> 00:57:15,505
So who are you talking to?

578
00:57:15,507 --> 00:57:17,707
Are you talking to Tom,
or are you talking to me?

579
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:26,446
You don't get it, do you?

580
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:29,982
When you finally find this,
you... you hold on to it.

581
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:32,551
You don't just sit around
and fucking talk about it.

582
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:35,554
That... that I don't understand.

583
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:36,556
Fuck!

584
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:43,126
You want to talk?

585
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:47,029
My brother, my older
brother, my only brother,

586
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:53,769
is serving life in prison for
killing both of our parents.

587
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:57,739
My... my dad died when I
was three, my real dad.

588
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:01,342
But my step dad
started fucking me

589
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:06,947
when I was like...
like seven or eight.

590
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:11,751
And he would use broom
handles and glass bottles,

591
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:13,219
he told me it was
because he loved me.

592
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:17,555
So I guess I... I guess
I sort of believe him.

593
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:21,458
And maybe it was
love... I don't know,

594
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:29,460
fucking seemed to make him
happy, but... but it hurt.

595
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:33,835
I guess that's what
he didn't know.

596
00:58:33,837 --> 00:58:40,007
It really... it
really fucking hurt.

597
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:42,909
Where was your mother?

598
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:43,911
She knew.

599
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:52,685
So... so when my brother found
out, he killed them both.

600
00:58:55,989 --> 00:58:58,190
First him, and then her.

601
00:59:10,736 --> 00:59:11,776
Any other questions?

602
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:34,390
What's your last name?

603
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:38,327
Wolf.

604
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:45,699
What?

605
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,701
What, that's my last name?

606
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:34,043
Hey... I'll be right back, OK?

607
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:56,931
Oh, hi.

608
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:59,633
Don't worry, they won't bite.

609
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:10,341
Alice, this is Pete and Lulu.

610
01:01:10,343 --> 01:01:12,042
Hi.

611
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:17,580
Hey, hey, hey... you're very big.

612
01:01:17,582 --> 01:01:21,116
Ah, they're not so big
once you get used to them.

613
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,086
Hi.

614
01:01:27,088 --> 01:01:29,168
It's good you told
the truth to everybody.

615
01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:34,491
You know the last
thing I said to Tom?

616
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:39,094
You're an asshole.

617
01:01:43,432 --> 01:01:44,698
Did you mean it?

618
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:52,270
He probably deserved it.

619
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:01,244
I should go.

620
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:14,956
Will you be all
right, walking home?

621
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,590
Yeah, I'll be fine.

622
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:21,561
Excuse me, Lulu.

623
01:02:38,878 --> 01:02:40,879
Rachel?

624
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:42,881
Rachel!

625
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:45,550
Rachel, are you all right?

626
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:47,084
No.

627
01:02:47,086 --> 01:02:49,352
How can I help?

628
01:02:49,354 --> 01:02:51,887
Leave.

629
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:52,889
Leave.

630
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:56,857
Neil!

631
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,063
I couldn't find you.

632
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:07,364
What's going on, Alice?

633
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,399
Let-let-let's get you in.

634
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:11,100
I'm not going back.

635
01:03:11,102 --> 01:03:13,635
Well, you can't stay out here.

636
01:03:13,637 --> 01:03:17,071
You... great healer.

637
01:03:17,073 --> 01:03:18,073
Help me up.

638
01:03:23,143 --> 01:03:25,911
Hand me that, would you please?

639
01:03:25,913 --> 01:03:27,345
Don't touch.

640
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:28,347
Please.

641
01:03:31,082 --> 01:03:38,354
I can... Rachel, we
can carry you back.

642
01:03:46,028 --> 01:03:47,595
OK.

643
01:03:48,965 --> 01:03:50,965
Rachel!

644
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:51,967
No!

645
01:03:57,904 --> 01:03:58,904
Rachel?

646
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:03,873
Rachel?

647
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:15,748
OK, you pull that
cover down, Alice.

648
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,951
Pull it down to take it off
there... take it all the way off

649
01:04:18,953 --> 01:04:20,519
and put it on the chair.

650
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:38,903
Take that off her, will you?

651
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:42,872
She's got another here.

652
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:45,507
Where, I don't know where.

653
01:04:56,852 --> 01:05:00,453
OK, then I'll lift and you pull.

654
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:01,455
OK.

655
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,209
Neil, here.

656
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:27,844
Here let me... you lift her.

657
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:05,147
I'll take care of
the rest, Alice.

658
01:06:05,149 --> 01:06:06,149
Thank you.

659
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:38,111
Charlie?

660
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,216
You're back.

661
01:06:45,218 --> 01:06:47,098
Something terrible has happened.

662
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:51,821
Rachel's dead.

663
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:57,625
Neil killed her by accident.

664
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:59,893
She was trying to leave,
ad she was hitting him

665
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:01,427
with this big stick.

666
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:06,097
And he tried to yank it from
her hands and he killed her.

667
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:07,364
What are you you saying?

668
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:10,967
Neil killed Rachel.

669
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:18,072
But he didn't mean to.

670
01:07:18,074 --> 01:07:21,642
No, no.

671
01:07:21,644 --> 01:07:22,643
Where is he?

672
01:07:22,645 --> 01:07:24,911
He's in the house with her.

673
01:07:24,913 --> 01:07:26,245
I feel terrible.

674
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:27,779
I don't...

675
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:28,880
Come here.

676
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:29,881
Charlie.

677
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:32,850
Get under here.

678
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:35,452
Till they ring the bell.

679
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:39,822
You're shaking.

680
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:50,131
She was dying, Alice.

681
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:51,465
Rachel was dying.

682
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,400
Everybody knew that.

683
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,302
But Charlie...

684
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:58,470
Just close your eyes.

685
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,675
We'll find out about it, OK?

686
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:34,135
I'll go first, OK?

687
01:08:34,137 --> 01:08:35,736
The expect me.

688
01:08:49,448 --> 01:08:53,083
It's like that every time,
Wayne, I'm telling you.

689
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:54,184
Day in and day out.

690
01:09:01,191 --> 01:09:04,359
Alice, we've been
waiting for you.

691
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:05,361
Here, sit here.

692
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:14,101
What's going on, Neil?

693
01:09:14,103 --> 01:09:15,302
Shouldn't we wait for Rachel?

694
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:16,536
Let the man speak.

695
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:25,044
She died.

696
01:09:25,046 --> 01:09:26,046
What?

697
01:09:30,615 --> 01:09:31,881
When?

698
01:09:31,883 --> 01:09:34,216
Rachel died last night.

699
01:09:34,218 --> 01:09:35,750
How?

700
01:09:35,752 --> 01:09:40,220
She had walked outside alone.

701
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:43,656
She must have fallen down.

702
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:46,091
Alice helped me carry her in.

703
01:09:48,794 --> 01:09:51,595
I know how much you loved her.

704
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,498
I loved her.

705
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:00,801
This is the time.

706
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:04,904
We should all leave together.

707
01:10:09,008 --> 01:10:14,077
Tomorrow, with Rachel.

708
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,578
As she'd want.

709
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,916
She's in the bedroom.

710
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,657
You should go see
Rachel if you'd like,

711
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,659
and then we need to
prepare everything.

712
01:10:51,944 --> 01:10:53,344
Charlie?

713
01:10:53,346 --> 01:10:54,878
Charlie, Neil's not
telling everything.

714
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,679
Rachel did not just
die, she was fighting.

715
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,113
I don't believe you.

716
01:10:58,115 --> 01:10:59,581
I was there.

717
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,848
I'm telling you what Neil
said is not what happened.

718
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:03,716
What the fuck,
Alice... he loved her.

719
01:11:06,252 --> 01:11:07,252
What is that for?

720
01:11:10,054 --> 01:11:11,054
Charlie?

721
01:11:16,925 --> 01:11:19,725
Charlie... what are you doing?

722
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:22,928
You are not going to shoot them.

723
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,563
Please, Charlie, we
can get out of here.

724
01:11:25,565 --> 01:11:26,497
We can leave right now.

725
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:27,164
And maybe we...

726
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,298
No!

727
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,401
You don't want to do this.

728
01:11:32,403 --> 01:11:34,536
Oh, you stupid fu...

729
01:11:34,538 --> 01:11:35,870
Shut up, Alice!

730
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:37,571
You do not want to shoot them!

731
01:11:37,573 --> 01:11:38,505
What are you doing?

732
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:39,507
Just stop it!

733
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:01,692
May I speak with you?

734
01:12:10,267 --> 01:12:12,635
She was a patient of mine.

735
01:12:12,637 --> 01:12:15,504
And you married her.

736
01:12:15,506 --> 01:12:19,641
We found this place
to help people.

737
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:22,810
You still consider
yourself a doctor?

738
01:12:22,812 --> 01:12:25,745
Do you still consider
yourself a journalist?

739
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:32,951
This is all about you, isn't it?

740
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:37,055
Yeah, most things
are, don't you think?

741
01:12:37,057 --> 01:12:40,224
The people here are happy
knowing that they'll

742
01:12:40,226 --> 01:12:43,427
be dead sooner than later.

743
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:45,762
You're selfish.

744
01:12:45,764 --> 01:12:48,765
No, the people in
my profession who

745
01:12:48,767 --> 01:12:56,238
prolong the lives of terribly
tormented people are selfish.

746
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,340
You know this?

747
01:12:58,342 --> 01:13:02,043
Do you think the
people here are unhappy?

748
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,077
They're joyous.

749
01:13:06,414 --> 01:13:09,849
What were you doing
outside last night?

750
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:12,351
I was wondering what Rachel
was doing in the driveway

751
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:13,353
last night.

752
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:18,688
She was dying, Alice.

753
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:25,661
She didn't believe
in you, anymore.

754
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:27,796
Is that why you lied to
everybody this morning

755
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:29,330
about how she died?

756
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,967
We're not so
different, Alice, you

757
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:40,273
and I. What are you
doing with Charlie?

758
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:45,677
I mean, you then maybe you
could take care of him?

759
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:51,349
Make his life a
worthwhile pursuit?

760
01:13:51,351 --> 01:13:55,819
Rid him of his bad memories?

761
01:13:55,821 --> 01:13:58,221
It's about you,
as you would say.

762
01:14:03,192 --> 01:14:04,225
And you?

763
01:14:07,996 --> 01:14:10,597
Why are you going
through with it?

764
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:17,069
Because it's the one
sure way not to fail them.

765
01:14:17,071 --> 01:14:22,207
And imagine... I wouldn't have
to answer questions like yours.

766
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:35,579
And Alice, you know, sometimes
when people stop in your life,

767
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:42,792
And Alice, you know, sometimes
when people stop in your life,

768
01:14:42,794 --> 01:14:45,027
there's nowhere to go.

769
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:49,997
It's too late.

770
01:15:10,651 --> 01:15:12,885
You're out of your mind.

771
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:23,894
...Jump in the ocean,
oh, nobody's business but mine.

772
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:28,431
Ain't nobody's
business but mine.

773
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:30,232
Ain't nobody...

774
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:34,369
Hey, you all right?

775
01:15:34,371 --> 01:15:36,003
You can come in.

776
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:50,082
You ready for tomorrow?

777
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:51,616
Oh, yeah.

778
01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:54,819
I've been ready for
quite some time.

779
01:15:58,924 --> 01:16:05,529
Do you ever think there
might be a way other than...

780
01:16:09,267 --> 01:16:12,068
You're not going to ruin
this for us, are you?

781
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:18,373
No.

782
01:16:26,713 --> 01:16:28,280
Here, give me some more.

783
01:16:28,282 --> 01:16:29,514
OK, here we go now.

784
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:32,149
Scottish humor for you.

785
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:36,085
Hey, hi!

786
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:37,086
Alice...

787
01:16:37,088 --> 01:16:38,454
Here?

788
01:16:38,456 --> 01:16:39,788
Yes, please.

789
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,156
Looking very beautiful
and fetching, my dear.

790
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:43,258
Thank you.

791
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,392
I have a toast.

792
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:45,760
Ah, Charlie, shut up.

793
01:16:45,762 --> 01:16:47,061
Oh, shut up yourself, Gordon.

794
01:16:47,063 --> 01:16:48,429
Gordon, you've had too much.

795
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:49,530
No.

796
01:16:49,532 --> 01:16:51,798
Shut up.

797
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,267
To Alice.

798
01:16:54,269 --> 01:16:55,468
To Alice.

799
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:56,936
To Alice.

800
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:04,676
And to all the other
dogs in my life.

801
01:17:04,678 --> 01:17:07,278
Ah, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

802
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,280
I bet your pardon?

803
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:13,350
That boy doesn't know
how to handle his liquor.

804
01:17:13,352 --> 01:17:14,517
Hey come on.

805
01:17:14,519 --> 01:17:15,551
We should all go
and sit by the fire.

806
01:17:15,553 --> 01:17:17,486
Very good idea.

807
01:17:17,488 --> 01:17:19,054
Come along, darling.

808
01:17:22,091 --> 01:17:28,129
Hey Alice... I wanted
to ask you something.

809
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:31,332
How was my wife,
when you saw her?

810
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:38,304
She didn't want to lose you.

811
01:17:43,476 --> 01:17:45,910
I'd have ruined the rest
of her life, you know?

812
01:17:48,647 --> 01:17:49,880
Thanks, though.

813
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:19,608
Alice!

814
01:18:24,212 --> 01:18:26,613
Hello, Alice.

815
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:27,615
Charlie.

816
01:18:30,483 --> 01:18:33,418
Will you dance with me?

817
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,886
Dance with him, hon.

818
01:18:34,888 --> 01:18:36,554
It'll be good for his soul.

819
01:19:08,853 --> 01:19:09,853
Charlie?

820
01:19:13,422 --> 01:19:15,656
Don't say it, Alice.

821
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:17,290
Don't say anything.

822
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,274
You all right, man?

823
01:20:11,276 --> 01:20:13,509
Haven't said a word all night.

824
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,250
Yeah.

825
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:25,218
I'm fine.

826
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:17,619
If you want to go...
now would be the time.

827
01:22:17,994 --> 01:22:20,961
I can walk you past the meadow
and you can follow the tracks

828
01:22:20,963 --> 01:22:24,197
and just go back
the way you came.

829
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:33,605
Come with me.

830
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,153
Then I'm staying.

831
01:23:39,966 --> 01:23:40,966
Alice?

832
01:26:41,646 --> 01:26:45,314
So remember,
concentrate on the song.

833
01:26:45,316 --> 01:26:48,684
That'll help.

834
01:26:51,486 --> 01:26:53,446
All right, well,
let's get started.

835
01:27:43,236 --> 01:27:44,236
OK.

836
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:54,844
It's OK.

837
01:28:00,216 --> 01:28:00,848
Wait!

838
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:04,284
Goddammit, wait.

839
01:28:04,286 --> 01:28:08,321
Stop, stop.

840
01:28:08,323 --> 01:28:09,922
What are you doing, Charlie?

841
01:28:14,126 --> 01:28:15,126
Charlie?

842
01:28:17,261 --> 01:28:19,462
I'm really sorry, everyone.

843
01:28:19,464 --> 01:28:20,763
I'm really, really sorry.

844
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:23,465
I won't let anybody
bother you, OK?

845
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:26,067
Alice, you have to come with me.

846
01:28:26,069 --> 01:28:28,903
Alice, you have to come with me.

847
01:28:28,905 --> 01:28:31,005
Wait, hold on a minute.

848
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:32,007
Let her go.

849
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,797
Good bye, Alice.

850
01:28:58,799 --> 01:28:59,799
Good bye.

851
01:29:07,137 --> 01:29:09,104
Hi, hi.

852
01:29:09,106 --> 01:29:12,874
Hi, baby, hi, baby.

853
01:29:12,876 --> 01:29:15,943
Hey, I'm going to get
you out of here, OK?

854
01:29:15,945 --> 01:29:18,445
OK?

855
01:29:18,447 --> 01:29:19,447
Yeah.

856
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,539
Oh, Charlie.

857
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,807
Come on.
