1
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,859
Man:
 Hello there. I'm your guide 
 and you're playing

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,162
"You Don't Know Jack."

3
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,098
And I need to know how many 
 contestants we have.

4
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,866
Okay, sleepy, 
 let's try that again.

5
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,103
How many people 
 are playing the game?

6
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,672
I'm sorry, was I talking 
 too quiet for you?

7
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,841
( shouts )
 How many people 
 are playing the game?

8
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:21,349
So, you're all alone 
 playing with yourself, huh?

9
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,184
God, I hate
this stupid game.

10
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,790
( sighs )

11
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,716
- Morning, Garnet!
- Morning yourself.

12
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,253
She's been up
all night again.

13
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,889
Mike Senior's
gonna wanna know.

14
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,792
Woman:
 Why don't you call him 
 at the ranch?

15
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,833
-( low growling )
- Man: Keith.

16
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,170
Aw, come on, Mike.
Garnet's busy doctoring.

17
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,938
She asked me
to feed the bull
just this once.

18
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,708
Keith,
uh-uh.

19
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,643
( sighs )

20
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,312
Why you wanna make her
come all the way out here

21
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,180
to feed that bull
is beyond me.

22
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:28,349
I want her to come out here
so I can keep an eye on her.

23
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,319
- See how she's doing.
- ( bull moos )

24
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,388
I figured,
well, if she starts
working 80 hours a week,

25
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,324
she'd work Mike
off her mind.

26
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,825
- Mike: That's what I wanted. 
- Keith: Oh, jeez.

27
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,328
Oop! Ah!
Get away! Ow!

28
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,762
Oop!

29
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,264
- ( Mike chuckles )
- ( Keith mutters )

30
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,199
( horse whinnies )

31
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,869
Mike: How long's
it been since you
saw Garnet laugh?

32
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,037
I don't know.

33
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,907
I figured
she bought that bull
and she'd shoot it.

34
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,344
That seemed 
 natural to me.

35
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,213
Well, buyin' that bull
that busted his head don't
seem natural to me.

36
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,282
Well, that's because
you're an ignorant savage,
you see?

37
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,217
That's psychology.

38
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,753
Keith:
 You call keeping the bull that 
 killed your son psychology?

39
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,856
Now here's what
I want you to do.

40
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,359
I want you to get
on the telephone,
call Garnet up.

41
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,827
Tell her
to come out here
and feed her own bull.

42
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,463
That's not gonna
cut no ice with Garnet.

43
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,498
You're gonna have
to be happy bossing
everybody else

44
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,368
- in the county around.
- Now, she's my family
and I love her

45
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,370
and I don't
want to see her
to suffer anymore.

46
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,438
Well, if you wouldn't
make her haul out here
every night

47
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,907
to feed that hay burner,
maybe she'd have time to find
herself another man.

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,909
She don't want
another man.

49
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,379
She just growls at 'em
and they run off.

50
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,381
I've gotta find some way
to make one of them

51
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,383
stand and fight,
but how do I do that?

52
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,285
Well, why don't you
give them some horses
or something,

53
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,253
'cause that's what
I think "ignorant
savages" would do.

54
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,854
Horses.

55
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,824
That's the dumbest idea
I ever heard in my life.

56
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,300
They told me you were
back in town, Marshal.

57
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,402
I swore 
 I wouldn't come.

58
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,871
I heard that there
were knife wounds.

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,844
- Here and here.
- They got better.

60
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,547
Only because the ancient
Blackfoot medicine man

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,285
pressed his magic talisman
to the wounds.

62
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,722
- Hmm. Breathe.
- ( boy pants )

63
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,891
"Hunda-hunda,"
breathe.

64
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,928
I know I can't
hold you, Marshal.

65
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:25,065
I know your job
comes first.

66
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,470
- But can I ask
one thing from you?
- What's that?

67
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,539
Would you pee
in this cup?

68
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:35,476
- Hmm.
- ( chuckles )

69
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,046
Hey, Ed, Sarah.

70
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,014
Oh, I wear it
so a little boy
who comes all the way

71
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,083
from Green River
will let me doctor him.

72
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,354
- He prefers saloon girls
to doctors.
- Who doesn't?

73
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:49,022
So, if you're a doctor
you can wear saloon dresses

74
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,559
- or space suits
or whatever?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,095
Of course, when you do,
good-for-nothings like
Jimmy Rawlinbow

76
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,599
will stake out your office
looking for cheap thrills.

77
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,868
Saw him on the way
in here.

78
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,970
Yeah. I don't know
who's more dangerous--

79
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,105
healthy guys who
play at being sick

80
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,508
or sick guys who play
at being healthy.

81
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,477
I took the stuff
and I got better.

82
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,045
You're sick
and out of work

83
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,483
and Wynette
is holding down
two jobs.

84
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,917
I can give you
the medicine.

85
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,419
Can't do that.

86
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,388
They send me
samples, Eddie.
Free samples.

87
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,922
They're rotting
in my cabinet.

88
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,458
I pay my own way.

89
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,394
If you wanna be macho
instead of healthy,

90
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,528
I'm gonna come down
on you so hard.

91
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,929
( chuckles )
Whoa!

92
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,032
If you're gonna
kill yourself being a man,

93
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,335
maybe you'd better
think about the people
that love you first.

94
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,074
Sarah, darlin',
will you get Dr. Garnet
a drink there?

95
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,543
Okay.

96
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:49,517
It's okay.
You cry if you
need to.

97
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,586
Crying's not going
to bring Michael back.

98
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,921
( sighs )

99
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,589
Could you take this
down to Arnel's,

100
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,658
have the prescription filled,
and then drop it

101
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,427
by Ed Pullman's place
on the way home?

102
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,662
Why not call it in
and have them deliver?

103
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,063
Because I need
to make it look

104
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,865
like a free sample
from the office.

105
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,634
I'd do it myself,
but I gotta go
to the ranch.

106
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,536
Don't even start
about that crazy business.

107
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,671
- Please.
- Okay.

108
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,941
Jimmy Rawlinbow
is the only one left
in the waiting room.

109
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,075
Do you want me
to send him in?

110
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,545
Not really.

111
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,416
Hello there, Jimmy.

112
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,685
- You're gettin' to be
kind of a regular here.
- Yeah.

113
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,954
Would you wear
that saloon girl
outfit for me?

114
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,189
No, not even if you had
to crawl five miles

115
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,559
on broken glass
to get here.

116
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,694
I'd consider it.

117
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,563
What's the problem?

118
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,565
Well, I was helping
Tommy B. move yesterday.

119
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:38,899
There was a lot
of heavy lifting.

120
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,501
Oh, not
the hernia again.

121
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,503
Jimmy, we've been
down this road before.

122
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,637
I'm not impressed.

123
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,539
( groans )

124
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,941
All right,
let's get it
over with.

125
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,485
- Still not impressed?
- Oh, stop it, Jimmy.

126
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,987
I can't help it.
It's an involuntary
reaction.

127
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,955
You're the doctor,
you take care of it.

128
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,491
All righty, then.

129
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,662
( snaps )

130
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,464
- ( thumps )
- Oh!

131
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,065
Good. 
 Now turn your head 
 and cough.

132
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,602
- ( shudders )
- No, no, no. 
 Cough.

133
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,904
- ( coughs weakly )
- Much better.

134
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,943
- Hi.
- Hey.

135
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,686
Now I'm gonna say
something to you

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,523
that you're not
gonna much like.

137
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,492
But it's the truth.
It needs to be said
and I'm gonna say it.

138
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,961
- Are you listenin'?
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:45,065
You know how much
Michael meant to me.

140
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,969
After my Ria passed away,
he was the only family I had

141
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,170
till you came along.

142
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,041
I love you, too, Pop.

143
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,276
But watching you mope around
miserable every day

144
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,679
is just too hard
to see.

145
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,516
I got a hole in my heart.

146
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,684
Well, then you
better fill it,

147
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,053
because I can't
take this anymore.

148
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,988
Oh, you can't?

149
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,124
Well, I'm just as sorry
as hell for you, Pop.

150
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,726
Now that's not what
I meant and you know it.

151
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,995
Sure, you did.

152
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,030
You want to reduce
my personal grief

153
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,066
to your not having
your own way.

154
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,602
Well, if seeing me sad
depresses you,

155
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,205
then you don't have
to see me anymore.

156
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,579
Oh, hell.

157
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,986
Hey, Cuddles.

158
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,054
( snorts )

159
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,124
Let's make friends.

160
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,105
Come on,
you bastard.

161
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,207
Let's play tag.

162
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,110
Hey!
What are you
doin' in there?

163
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,679
( grunts )

164
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:15,689
Look, having you gone
is a whole lot worse
than having you sad.

165
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,725
Why don't you say
we cut a deal?

166
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,193
What kind of deal?

167
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,129
If you'll show up
at every event

168
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,598
at next week's
Centennial

169
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,067
with an eligible male,

170
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,137
I'll feed your
dadgum bull for a year.

171
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,279
( huffs )

172
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,615
( phone rings )

173
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,355
Aren't any of us
really sick.

174
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,658
Mike called
a bunch of us.

175
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,727
Rosie said you're looking
for dates for every day
of the Centennial?

176
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,763
There's bound to be
lots of men asking.

177
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,297
You're a pretty lady.

178
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,199
- And what was
Mike's offer?
- Land.

179
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,234
The Five Corners section
down at the river bottom.

180
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,736
But that ain't it.

181
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,806
You know I had a crush
on you since 6th grade?

182
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,377
Ahem.

183
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,315
She's got
a real nice
energy.

184
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,784
Good grazin'
land, too.

185
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,788
( sighs )
Can you believe it?

186
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,691
He posted
a dowry on me.

187
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:27,094
That old goat
put a bounty
on my pelt.

188
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:36,203
( sighs )
So, he wants me
to get a man.

189
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,806
Okay, fine.
I'll get a man.

190
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,175
But I'm going
to own him.

191
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,679
- I'll see ya, all right?
- Take it easy.

192
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,681
See you next week.

193
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,320
Woman:
 Bryan Jemsen, 
 I've got something here

194
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,955
you're really 
 going to like.

195
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,792
Oh! Sweaty!

196
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,731
I gave the recording
of your symphony

197
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,398
to a Hollywood agent
I know.

198
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,935
He listened, he liked,

199
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:11,371
he says he can get you
a lot of work doing
movies and TV.

200
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,274
( laughs )

201
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,376
- Movies and television?
- Yeah.

202
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,212
- Well, that would be great!
- ( giggles )

203
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,885
- How can I thank you?
- Come back to L.A. with me.

204
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,390
Jenny, you're one of
my most favorite people

205
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,793
in the whole world,
you know that.

206
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,227
But I'm not sure
if I can--

207
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,496
If you really love me,
that's okay.

208
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,732
This is
how you find out.

209
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,468
After we've lived
together for a while,
you'll know.

210
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,908
You won't be sponging
off me, Bryan.

211
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,845
Besides, think of all
the fun we have together.

212
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,950
You like it. 
 You know you do.

213
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,452
( plays melody )

214
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,391
You drove
250 miles for this?

215
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,762
Jill, a professional escort
is exactly what I need.

216
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,464
And I thought you didn't
approve of my line of work.

217
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,201
Jill, I don't
want a romance.

218
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,537
I just want
an employee.

219
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,439
How about
George here?

220
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,776
He's very, 
 um... talented.

221
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,513
Um, do you have someone
with just a few wrinkles?

222
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,783
Mario.
There.

223
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,052
He's almost 28
and he's well packaged.

224
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,023
- ( phone rings ) 
- Jill: Yeah.

225
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:40,928
No, you're supposed
to be booked tomorrow night
at 7:00, not tonight.

226
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,529
Sorry.

227
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,832
You know, when I used to call
Michael at the ranch,

228
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,901
he would always
have this way

229
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,536
of knowing
that it was me.

230
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,839
So when I'd call,

231
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,909
he'd answer the phone
with, "Hi, hon',"

232
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,978
without me
saying a word.

233
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,953
And sometimes I would
catch him watching me

234
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:09,990
when I'd be looking
at a...

235
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:14,327
you know, a sunset
or a baby.

236
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,965
I mean, something 
 profoundly beautiful.

237
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,533
And he would
rather watch me.

238
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,276
Do you know how
that makes you feel?

239
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,845
( chuckles, sighs )

240
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,314
I mean, how could you forget
something like that?

241
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,386
I can't.

242
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,890
And I won't.

243
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,596
He sounds
pretty wonderful.

244
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,568
Yeah. He was perfect.

245
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,875
You know...

246
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,479
I just may have
a guy for you.

247
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,983
Tell me again why
I should do this.

248
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,420
Because you love
your little sister?

249
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,655
I'm hurtin'
financially here,
okay?

250
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,926
- I really need
the commission.
- Use someone else.

251
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,428
You're what she needs.
You fit the bill.

252
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,931
- I told you.
I don't have anyone else.
- I don't know how to do this.

253
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,432
I'm not gonna take
that lady's money.

254
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,101
You don't have to.
I'll take her money.

255
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:32,139
Bryan, Mom's therapy costs
and this could help.

256
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:36,576
- Besides, it'd be
good for you.
- Good for me?

257
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,411
What you need
is to stop, Bryan,

258
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,981
and really think about
what you're doing.

259
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,050
You write music
that will get heard someday

260
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,919
with or without 
 Virginia.

261
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,387
Jenny said
the same thing.

262
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,589
Oh, she's good.

263
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,026
Please?
It's the right thing to do.

264
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,196
This is the doctor
who helped Mom.
I like her.

265
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,198
I wanna help her.

266
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,001
And how long
are we talking about?

267
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,470
- Just a week.
- Five days?

268
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,472
A week...
of sanctuary

269
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,374
where you can take
a deep breath

270
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,476
and think about
what you're doing.

271
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,212
What if somebody
up there figures out
she's buying the service?

272
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,082
- Look, there's no sex, okay?
- Damn right there's no sex.

273
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,417
Worst that can happen,
you blow our scam.

274
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,219
Of course, you don't
want her to find out
that you're my brother.

275
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,954
That would really 
 be embarrassing.

276
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,390
All she wants
is control of her life.

277
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,226
Well, control isn't everything
that it's cracked up to be.

278
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,162
Oh, it's okay for Virginia,
but not for the doctor?

279
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,964
Come on.

280
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,434
What she wants
is for you to help her
have some fun.

281
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,175
If I do this,
you're gonna owe me.

282
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,545
Maybe.
Maybe not.

283
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,046
( sighs )

284
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,117
Car troubles?

285
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,254
Yeah, it's blockin'
my view.

286
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,189
Older man:
 Pretty this time 
 of the year, ain't it?

287
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,161
Hey, do you know where
Garnet Hadley's place is?

288
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,463
Well, now, there,
then it's clear across

289
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,266
the other side of town.
Now you could go down here--

290
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,601
well, no, just go
down the street here
and turn left

291
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,536
and go about two blocks
and then turn right

292
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,239
and go about
three more blocks,
down Lincoln Avenue,

293
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,041
and then when you get
to Franklin, turn left.

294
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,143
Come up to a big,
large poplar tree

295
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,279
and it's about
two blocks past that.

296
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,083
Okay, thank you.

297
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,091
I'll leave
my car here, okay?

298
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,225
Sure.

299
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,729
- Okay.
- Thanks, Garnet.

300
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,531
He cut his hair with
the safety scissors

301
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,066
and then while
I'm cleaning up
the hair,

302
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,235
he eats the whole bottle
of orange baby aspirin.

303
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,070
Yeah, well, he must
have been very depressed

304
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,505
- about his haircut.
- ( chuckles )

305
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,639
- Bye.
- Bye.

306
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,708
Oh, gentlemen, howdy.

307
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,077
Everyone, I have
an announcement to make.

308
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,314
My boyfriend from Denver
will be arriving here
this afternoon.

309
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,150
- Receptionist:
 He's here. 
- He's what?

310
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,552
Jacob Barnes 
 told Barbie Spencer

311
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,621
that a guy
with Colorado plates
was asking for you

312
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,157
- over on Schilling.
- He's here.

313
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,726
I gotta go find him.

314
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,236
Hey, Becky! Christine!

315
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,772
Have you seen a new guy
wandering around here?

316
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,741
- Girl: No.
- No?

317
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,255
Where is this guy?
( sighs )

318
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,232
( birds chirping )

319
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:41,288
Excuse me? Excuse me?
Are you all right?

320
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,323
I'm a doctor.

321
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,592
Are you "the" doctor?

322
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,261
Uh, yeah.
You must be the--

323
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,929
uh-- wait a second.

324
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,864
What are you doing here
lying on your back?

325
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,403
I was arranging
some clouds.

326
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,271
Pardon me?

327
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,174
Well, my dad taught me.
He said if you lay flat
on the ground

328
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,610
and use the Earth's power

329
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,179
that you can push the clouds
around with your mind.

330
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,216
( chuckles )
And does it work?

331
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,883
Well, yeah,
if you're patient.

332
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,387
It usually does.
But you tell me.

333
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,859
Bryan:
 What do you think?

334
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,329
How am I doing?

335
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,633
Okay, okay.
Um... why didn't you
come to me directly?

336
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,934
I-- I mean,
what have you
been doing

337
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,370
wandering around
here for the last
three hours?

338
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,871
How did you know
when I got to town?

339
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,874
Well, you met Mr. Barnes
at about 10 after 1:00

340
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,409
when you came
into town,

341
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,679
who told Jan Hunt
you were looking
for me,

342
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,248
who then told
Meg Spencer,

343
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,883
who called
my receptionist.

344
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,853
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, well, that's life
in Sweetwater. Come on.

345
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,222
I mean, if you
let one word slip
around here,

346
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,790
I mean,
this whole thing
could fall apart.

347
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,325
What whole thing?

348
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,694
Hasn't your boss
briefed you?

349
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,929
Well, she said that we're
supposed to be lovers,

350
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:00,933
but that we'd work out
the details here.

351
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,436
I don't get this.
I mean, you're very pretty.

352
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,238
Okay, stop.

353
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,907
Save it for the public
when we've got someone
to sell.

354
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,843
( engine starts )

355
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,017
So what exactly
are we selling?

356
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,887
We've been lovers
for the last six months.

357
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,457
We will inevitably marry
and live happily ever after.

358
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,926
Bryan:
Okay.

359
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,866
Why do we want them
to believe that?

360
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,436
No, no, no, no.
There is no "we."

361
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,439
Why I want them to believe,
that is my business.
Now, come on.

362
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,482
- Kiss me.
- Hmm?

363
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,518
- Oh.
- No, kiss me.

364
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,986
Neighbors.
Don't look.
Kiss me.

365
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,893
- ( splatters )
- Oh!

366
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,471
- Not bad.
- Thanks.

367
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,508
Now, take me
into the house

368
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,810
and make it look
like you love me

369
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,413
- and that you've
missed me.
- Okay.

370
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,887
Oh--!

371
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,361
Bryan:
Let me get
the door for you.

372
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:44,837
Ahem.

373
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,475
So, Jill told me
this odd little story.

374
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,477
I thought maybe
you might help me
understand.

375
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,912
Okay,
fair enough.

376
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,881
Look, I'm a little
nervous here.

377
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,883
This is all
very new to me.

378
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:01,120
Yeah, yeah.
Why am I here?

379
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,989
I mean, Mrs. Bray
down at the Food Mart

380
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,591
says you're the prize
catch in town.

381
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,959
You were talking
to Muriel Bray?

382
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,495
If you were
asking about me,

383
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,564
then she's gonna know
that we're not involved.

384
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:15,001
I mean, Dan Rather
doesn't reach as many
people in Sweetwater

385
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,370
- as Muriel Bray.
- Calm down. Calm down.

386
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,005
I mean, we wowed
the neighbors.

387
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,073
They think we're in love.
I mean, I know what to do,

388
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,009
I just wondered why.

389
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:30,116
Tomorrow my husband
will have been dead
two years.

390
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,920
I can't forget him.

391
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,023
Even if I am
"the prize catch
in town."

392
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,629
Sorry,
that must be tough.

393
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,899
Thank you.

394
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,502
I think you mean that.

395
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:53,573
Anyway, people around here
won't give me a break.

396
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,509
I mean, they feel 
 that I have exceeded

397
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,945
the socially acceptable
mourning period.

398
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,481
Like there is
such a thing.

399
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:05,418
Right.
Exactly right.

400
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:08,455
Oh, gosh.
It's nice to
finally meet

401
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,022
somebody
who understands.

402
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,959
Well, I didn't say
I understood.

403
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,194
I mean, isn't it possible
to love the man you lost

404
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,996
and somebody else, too?

405
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,866
Nobody could ever
replace Michael.

406
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,471
Well, it's possible
that you can love

407
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,539
more than one person
at a time.

408
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,442
Really?

409
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,177
Well, you don't
even know me.

410
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,946
Well, I know
how you kiss.

411
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,482
Yeah, well,
that was nothing.

412
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,917
You should see how
I kiss people that I like.

413
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,652
Tell me about it.

414
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:42,622
I have to pretend to enjoy
kissing some very bossy,

415
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,223
mean-tempered women.

416
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,894
- ( knocking )
- Come here.
Come here!

417
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,028
- Wha-wha-wha--?
- Come in!

418
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,900
Oh!
Oh, Pop, hi.

419
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,905
I just wanted to be sure
that you didn't think

420
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:03,510
that I was being unfaithful
to Michael's memory.

421
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:07,614
But when you
sent every bachelor
in the county

422
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,650
to court me,
well, I knew
you were serious.

423
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,920
And because I know 
 this relationship

424
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,056
is really 
 the one for me,

425
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,960
I felt it was okay now
for you to know about Bryan.

426
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,228
- Hi.
- Hey.

427
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,697
- You know...
- Yeah?

428
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,733
this ain't
half bad.

429
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:29,035
I never have been
an omelet man myself,

430
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,003
but this is
all right.

431
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,039
Reckon you can
rustle me up
another one?

432
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,041
Uh... actually, no.

433
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,744
I used the last
of the butter and
onions and bacon.

434
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:40,179
I mean, I can try it
with grapes and popcorn,

435
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,048
but I don't think
it'll be the same.

436
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,517
That's funny.

437
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,586
Well, you're more
surefooted in the kitchen

438
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,054
than Garnet here.

439
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:53,225
Well, yeah, sure,
'cause Bryan worked--

440
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,562
you cooked
in a kitchen,
didn't you?

441
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:59,566
Uh... well, kitchened
in the place for a while.

442
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,634
Oh, is that a fact?
Place, huh?

443
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,570
What place was that?

444
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:07,206
A place called
The Brownstone
in Denver.

445
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,608
Right, right.
Brownstone.

446
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,577
Brownstone.

447
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,211
Any reason
you wanna know?

448
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,714
Oh, I might wanna
pay 'em a visit.

449
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,282
And why is that?

450
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,751
Garnet and I had
a little talk last week

451
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,753
and a talk that would
have included you

452
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,321
if you'd been for real.

453
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,256
How long you two supposed
to have been together?

454
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,727
Six months.

455
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,030
You remember those
twice-a-month visits

456
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,732
to the clinic
in Denver.

457
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:36,636
Well, geriatrics
weren't the only ones

458
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,705
I was seeing.

459
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,140
If you've known him
longer than yesterday,

460
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,843
I'll smile
and kiss a pig.

461
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,245
Well, you just
pucker up, Pop.

462
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,281
You're the one who
wanted me to get a guy,
remember?

463
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,652
Well, I got a guy.

464
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,354
- That is not your guy.
- Oh, yes, he is.

465
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,723
Although,
by the looks
of him,

466
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,726
I expect he'd warm
to the idea.

467
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,728
Now I wanna know 
 what's goin' on here.

468
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,596
I-- I-- look,

469
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,365
I know this comes
as kind of a shock
to you, sir,

470
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,701
but you're really
making more of this
than is necessary.

471
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,737
Look, son, I'm trying
to talk to my girl.

472
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,073
Do you wanna step
out of the way?

473
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,775
No, I don't
believe I do.

474
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,812
She's actually
got you convinced

475
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,148
that you're helping her,
doesn't she?

476
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,283
Let me tell you something.
You're not helping her.

477
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,687
She's a big girl.
She can make up
her own mind.

478
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,122
You don't wanna
get in my way, son.

479
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:31,758
If I have to
go through you,

480
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,260
I'm gonna leave
one hellacious hole.

481
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,862
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, Pop.

482
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,363
You be careful
how you talk to him.

483
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,765
We could be
a family soon.

484
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,900
Family? I--
I'm your family.

485
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,635
Okay.
Fine, then.

486
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:45,171
You can do the dishes.
We're gonna go to bed.

487
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,806
You want me
to do the dishes?

488
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,641
Well, sure,
I'll do the dishes.

489
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:49,909
- Ah!
- There.

490
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,779
They're done.

491
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:56,783
I may be uneducated,
but I do learn real quick.

492
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:00,653
One thing I'm gonna learn
is what the two of you
are up to.

493
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:02,822
You kids have
a good night.

494
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,196
( door closes )

495
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,832
So, you think
he bought it?

496
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,366
Yeah.

497
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,341
I think the stain
is permanent.

498
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,211
I really liked
this sweater, too.

499
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,446
Hey, where did
you get that shirt?

500
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,682
In the dryer.

501
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:32,284
Just be careful
with it.

502
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,420
Sure.

503
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,122
( classical piano music 
 playing )

504
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:42,194
You're kidding.
You went to Georgetown?

505
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,896
Yeah, that's actually
how I met Jill

506
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,298
till she dropped out
and went into your business.

507
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,401
Then I did my residency
at Johns Hopkins,

508
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,370
second in my class.

509
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,372
Well, you could
practice anywhere
in the world.

510
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,374
What are you
doing here?

511
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,909
I like it here.

512
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,878
Before I was here,
people had to drive

513
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,980
all the way to Jackson.

514
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,751
So it's
a humanitarian thing?

515
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,153
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm a saint.

516
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:14,160
Don't you think
we ought to get to know
each other a little?

517
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,730
No. 
 That's the whole idea.

518
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:19,732
No, not out of any
real attraction.

519
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,400
We're supposed
to be engaged.

520
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,770
We don't even know squat
about each other.

521
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,839
And your father-in-law
saw right through you.

522
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:31,410
I'm sure that you're
a highly competent

523
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,412
professional...

524
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,883
- Prostitute?
- All right, if you prefer.

525
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:40,319
My point is that there are
things within your realm

526
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,822
of expertise
that I will need.

527
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,858
And there are things
that I won't.

528
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,895
You're not exactly
a social scientist,
okay?

529
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,764
But they all agree
I've got great lateral
mobility.

530
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,934
Oh, I bet they do.
But I am deliberately

531
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,769
trying to avoid
familiarity.

532
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:59,972
I hired you so that
there would be no danger

533
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:03,943
of your getting
emotionally involved.

534
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,744
Danger with you?

535
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,316
I appreciate
your confidence.

536
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,018
I'm sure you're used to
just bowling them over

537
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,921
with brains
and sophistication
out here in the sticks.

538
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,423
- You're not even
a bad-looking woman.
- Thank you.

539
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,992
I have actually
noticed you watching me

540
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:22,261
when I wasn't
looking.

541
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,031
I was making
a professional
assessment.

542
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:27,967
And it's not like
I've never seen better.

543
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,269
Just because I'm not
the most beautiful woman

544
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:34,406
you've ever been with
doesn't mean you still
may not want me.

545
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,409
Me want you?

546
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,878
Please.

547
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:44,350
I do believe that
I can contain myself.

548
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,853
- Come here.
- Why?

549
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,087
I wanna show you
something.

550
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,022
- Come here.
- ( sighs )

551
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,961
- Just stand.
- What are you doing?

552
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,829
Just stand there.

553
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,931
Watch.

554
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,969
Hey, watch it,
buster!

555
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,871
Hey, I'm a professional,
remember?

556
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:07,039
Just watch.
Put your mind at ease.

557
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,096
So what do you
say, boss?

558
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,131
Are you still
worried about my
professionalism?

559
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,832
No.

560
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,005
So where do I sleep?

561
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,008
Oh, guest room,
third floor.

562
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,410
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

563
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,916
( exhales )

564
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,386
( yawns )

565
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,924
Okay.

566
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:02,594
All right.

567
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:06,332
I need your advice
on a little matter.

568
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,901
I've got to travel
down to Denver

569
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:12,338
on some very
important business
tomorrow.

570
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,506
You can't do that, Mike.
It's the Centennial.

571
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,477
Yeah, I know,
but like I told you,
it's very important.

572
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,446
Either I've gotta go

573
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,649
or I gotta send
somebody I can trust.

574
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,985
Come on, Mike,
you know I'd milk
a bull for you,

575
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,587
but I've been
looking forward
to this all year.

576
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,558
Roping team needs me
and I got a date.

577
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,927
About Garnet.

578
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,362
( moans )

579
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:40,166
Good man,
Keith.

580
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,401
Look, this is what
I need you to do.

581
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,603
This has gotta stay
between you and me.

582
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:49,141
( faint dog barking )

583
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,063
Uh...

584
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,437
( knocking )

585
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,451
Hey.

586
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,457
Oh, hi.
Something--

587
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,661
Do you ever just
sleep with people?

588
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,995
What?

589
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:22,734
I mean, do you ever...
hold somebody

590
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,636
without sex?

591
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,807
Just sleep 
 with them?

592
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,110
I do whatever
I'm told, boss.
You know that.

593
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:36,148
Well, I thought
that it might help

594
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:39,718
when I'm trying
to convince people
that we're--

595
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:44,056
- you know.
- Well, it's a good idea.

596
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,591
I was wondering
what might happen

597
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,493
if your father-in-law
was watching the house.

598
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,262
Right, right.
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I said we were lovers

599
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:54,833
and there have been
lights on on both floors
of the house.

600
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,303
Well, that's okay.
Just tell him
we had a spat.

601
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,571
That I thought
he was a jerk and
you stuck up for him.

602
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,541
Right, oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

603
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:03,842
He'd buy that.

604
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,146
Boy, you really
are good at this.

605
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,248
I am a professional.

606
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,556
Can I ask you to do
one more thing for me?

607
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:22,194
Would you
put this on?

608
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,364
I never wear
shirts to bed.

609
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,166
I would really
appreciate it

610
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,101
if you could
wear this.

611
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:32,171
Is that a problem?

612
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:35,607
Is that
what Michael wore?

613
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:38,177
What if it was?

614
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,580
Think that would be some
big hairy social perversion?

615
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:44,283
Like social perversions
aren't your bread and butter.

616
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,218
I'm a doctor.
What are you?

617
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,319
I'm an--

618
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,191
An employee.

619
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,626
Delicately put.

620
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,130
Look, um, you're right.
I'm sorry.

621
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,199
I wasn't thinking.

622
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:02,334
I wasn't really awake.

623
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,375
I...

624
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,310
I can do this
for you.

625
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,146
I can.

626
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,653
Is this okay?

627
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,849
( sighs )

628
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,792
( sighs )

629
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,363
I'm--
I'm sorry, Jill.

630
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,465
I mean, it's just
getting outta hand.

631
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,367
Things are getting
seriously weird

632
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,770
and I don't think
I'm doing her any good.

633
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:48,374
Well, I'm getting
really uncomfortable.

634
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:51,310
Oh, no, no.
Don't guilt trip me.

635
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,412
Okay, no, I-- look,
I'll find some money
for Mom.

636
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,681
I'll work
in a gas station.

637
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,449
Well, commission
or no commission.

638
00:36:57,483 --> 00:37:00,819
Look, I-- I don't think
I can keep this up.

639
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:03,221
- I gotta go.
- ( beeps )

640
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,229
- Morning.
- Oh, morning.

641
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,834
- Coffee?
- Oh, thanks.

642
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,742
- I wanted to talk
about last night.
- Last night.

643
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,677
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah.

644
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,283
It was wonderful.

645
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:32,784
What?

646
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,821
Well, it was the first
good night's sleep

647
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,857
that I've had
in two years.

648
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,729
And I'm grateful
to you for that.

649
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,332
It was nothing really.
I mean, I--

650
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:49,435
No, it was a lot.

651
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:53,472
You've been really patient
under the circumstances.

652
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,874
I know I've given you
a lot of attitude

653
00:37:55,907 --> 00:38:00,479
and you're
still here.

654
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:05,851
So I promise
not to be such
a pain in the--

655
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,320
you know-- anymore.

656
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:09,855
Can you do that?

657
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:13,959
( laughs )
Try me.

658
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:16,562
Sorry. 
 Fact is--

659
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:20,366
Gosh, I'm feeling, like,
this primal feminine urge

660
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:23,068
like I should cook
for you or something,

661
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:25,871
except that
my cooking stinks.

662
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:32,344
So how about
we go to the
Centennial picnic

663
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:36,382
and we can sample some
of Sweetwater's best?

664
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,519
Well, my clothes
are still in my car.

665
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,320
Oh, I've got
a houseful of clothes.

666
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,524
Michael's clothes.

667
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,995
It won't bother me.

668
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:53,899
Well, let's 
 get going.

669
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:56,602
I wanna show you off.

670
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,407
Okay.

671
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,549
Hey, big guy.

672
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:18,857
Ride 'em there, cowboy.
That's it.

673
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,528
Hey, Doc,
how are you?

674
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,830
- Garnet: Whoa!
- Man: Nice-lookin'
fella, huh?

675
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:28,500
- Man: Garnet.
- Howdy.

676
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,405
This is great.

677
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,541
Say, I can't remember
the last time I had
homemade ice cream.

678
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,509
No, I mean us.
We look great together.

679
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,411
People are really
believing us.

680
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:41,847
- Yeah, I hope so.
- It's working.

681
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,150
I just spoke
to the restaurant
in Denver last night.

682
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,553
They said you were there
less than a month.

683
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:50,021
Well, I got
a better offer.
That's life.

684
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,491
Mm-hmm. The manager knew
where you worked before

685
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:55,661
and where you worked after.
That's three jobs at least.

686
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,929
You don't seem to have
much stayin' power.

687
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,098
Isn't it time
for the mayor's
speech?

688
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,967
Oh, they won't start
without us.

689
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,903
- Who is this guy, anyway?
- My boyfriend.

690
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,939
What if he has the same
attitude toward women
he has toward work--

691
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,676
something better
comes along,
he'd just leave?

692
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,445
Sir, women and jobs
are kind of alike.

693
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,881
You find the right one,
devotion's never even
an issue.

694
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,583
Oh, that's so sweet.

695
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:18,984
You know,
I like you better

696
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,186
as a dish rag
than as a philosopher.

697
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,522
Hey, he was
trying to offer
a polite response

698
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,990
to an insult,
you moron.

699
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,925
If I were a man,
I would have knocked
you down.

700
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,960
If you had a man,
you wouldn't have to.

701
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:31,196
Well, maybe we can just
settle this girl-to-girl.

702
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,164
Garnet: 
 Huh!

703
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,538
You asked for it, son.
Now you gonna get it.

704
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,206
Come on.

705
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,609
You know me, I'm sorry,
I just lost my temper.

706
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,977
- Do you want me to stop this?
- No, I want him to stop this.

707
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,245
This isn't part
of the job description.

708
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,015
Now use your reach
and keep moving.

709
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:54,152
And here I was working
so hard to convince you
I was polite.

710
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,687
Don't worry about it.

711
00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,925
Yeah, you hit
like a girl.

712
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,528
( grunts )

713
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,029
All right, look,
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,032
You punch pretty good
for an old guy.

715
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,600
That's not much
of a compliment

716
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,503
coming from a man
that can't punch at all.

717
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,038
Oh, yeah? 
 Well, hang on.

718
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,606
I'll try and make it
significant.

719
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,707
Oh!

720
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,650
Well, that's
not bad, son,

721
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,518
but I'm gonna have 
 to drop you now.

722
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:29,621
I've gotta make a speech
on community brotherhood.

723
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,956
- You're the mayor?
- Yep.

724
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,024
Great.
Sorry.

725
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,125
Ooh--!

726
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,528
Oh, this is great!

727
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,129
( gasps )
I've got responsibilities.

728
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:41,232
Excuse me.

729
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,802
- ( squeals )
- ( crowd applauds )

730
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,004
Wasn't he great?
Wasn't he?

731
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,206
- That was great.
- ( crowd applauds )

732
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,276
- Mike: Sweetwater is a town...
- Man: Nice fight.

733
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,978
- Thanks.
- ...where every man
is your neighbor.

734
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,781
So if you can't hide
from him in a crowd,

735
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,649
you'd better
get to know him

736
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,185
by any means
possible.

737
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,021
( applause )

738
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:10,996
Garnet:
 So if you look at the sky 
 and you're patient,

739
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,665
you can move the clouds
where you want them to?

740
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,167
Patience is
a big part of it.

741
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,770
Faith is more
important.

742
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,006
You know, at first
I thought you
were kidding.

743
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,075
But now it
doesn't matter.

744
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:26,778
I think
it's wonderful.

745
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:30,248
You know,
I've seen
the Bolshoi

746
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,019
and I've looked
at a wall full
of Monets,

747
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,756
and I have been two feet
from the crown jewels,

748
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,326
but never in my life
have I seen the likes

749
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,028
of your right uppercut

750
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:47,132
that knocked the bluster
out of Mike Hadley.

751
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,300
( chuckles )

752
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:55,140
That was pretty funny
what you said about devotion.

753
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,275
I mean, of course,
he didn't get it,

754
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,645
but knowing
what your job is,
it was pretty funny.

755
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,152
So is this the job
you're devoted to?

756
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:13,591
Could be.

757
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:41,419
Do you always comb
your hair before bed?

758
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,089
You busted me.

759
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,895
Glad you came up.

760
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:51,830
Didn't realize
how much I've missed

761
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:55,734
lying in someone's
arms at night.

762
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,103
Proud to serve.

763
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,238
Every inch
the professional.

764
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,110
Oh, oh, here.

765
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:11,349
Are we still sure
about every inch...

766
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,284
of being
professional?

767
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,454
I haven't had
any complaints.

768
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,857
Lucky you.

769
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,360
We had fun today,
didn't we?

770
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,162
Yeah, we did.

771
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:31,136
I really like you,

772
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,371
but I still don't
want to do anything

773
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,707
but just sleep
together.

774
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,242
I mean, are you
up for that?

775
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,779
- Is that still
okay with you?
- Sure.

776
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,714
- It is?
- Yeah.

777
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:44,415
Good.

778
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,263
Boy, this is a--
it's been a treat

779
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,732
not having to perform
sexually every 10 minutes.

780
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:02,433
- Every 10?
- Well, every 20.

781
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:05,270
Kinda like
a vacation.

782
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:08,306
Well, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

783
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,885
Are you okay?

784
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:26,424
You're gonna have to
excuse me for a moment.

785
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,460
Ahem.

786
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,438
You know, there's really
not a lot of guys

787
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,941
- who could do this
sort of thing.
- ( water pattering )

788
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:46,812
I'm gaining
a real appreciation
for your profession.

789
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49,214
Anything I can
do to help out.

790
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,919
( giggles )

791
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:56,287
( classical music 
 playing )

792
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,946
( applause )

793
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,483
That was great!

794
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,352
It was great.
Do you know how tough
that piece is?

795
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,054
They have some
real musicians
in this town.

796
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:32,023
Yeah, I like baroque,
but I really prefer Russian.

797
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:33,391
Especially
Tchaikovsky.

798
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:35,593
"Peter and the Wolf"
is my favorite.

799
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,429
You know, I could
teach you about music.

800
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,098
Prokofiev.

801
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,566
Excuse me?

802
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,102
Prokofiev, he wrote
"Peter and the Wolf."

803
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,037
And Tchaikovsky
isn't really
considered

804
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:47,839
very Russian.

805
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:49,407
Tchaikovsky
isn't Russian?

806
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,609
Well, he was mostly
aping the Germans

807
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,978
and the Italians
of the time.

808
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:55,046
Rimsky-Korsakov
and Mussorgsky

809
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,482
are considered the real
Russian-sounding guys.

810
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:02,988
Well, we are full
of surprises, aren't we?

811
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:07,859
Oh, that depends.
Do we like surprises?

812
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:12,130
Oh, we have always
loved surprises.

813
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,899
( country music playing )

814
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:16,334
Well, you may know a little
something about music,

815
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:21,106
but the real question is
can you dance?

816
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,615
( music ends )

817
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:17,528
( sighs )

818
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:50,128
Mike:
Come to give me another
shot at the championship?

819
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:53,664
I've had enough.
If you wanna hit me again,
you're gonna have to catch me.

820
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:57,602
( chuckles )
No, son, I don't
chase trouble.

821
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:00,638
You know, I know
there's some kind
of a scam playing here,

822
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,573
but I don't know
what it is.

823
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:05,176
But you made
my Garnet laugh
again.

824
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,677
For that,
I'm grateful.

825
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,983
You don't wanna tell me
what this is all about?

826
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:14,619
It's true love, sir.

827
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,988
You know, I'm supposed
to set up a picnic

828
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:20,525
at some stock pond,
but I got lost.

829
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:24,495
- She wanted you to go
to the stock pond?
- Yes, sir.

830
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,604
That's where
Michael proposed.

831
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,678
- ( bull grunts ) 
- Jeez!

832
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:44,082
- ( Mike laughs )
- That is one big--

833
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:46,151
How do you know
when he's gonna stop?

834
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:48,453
Oh, I know that brute
better than any
of the rest of them

835
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,721
on this ranch.

836
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,591
She didn't tell you
about him?

837
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,460
No, why would she?

838
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,696
Well, sir,
unlike some folks,

839
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,566
I believe a man can be
more useful the more
information he's got.

840
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,702
I like to be useful.

841
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,505
Let me tell you
a little story.

842
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:12,277
My son used
to ride bulls.

843
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,147
He rode that one...
once.

844
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,119
( snorts )

845
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,827
( quacking )

846
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,263
- Bryan: Hey.
- Hey.

847
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:36,101
I thought you were
gonna get here first
and set up.

848
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,202
Did you get lost?

849
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,537
Yeah, I ended up
at the main house,

850
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,206
- bumped into Mike.
- Oh.

851
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,740
Was he hard on you?

852
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,110
No, he's rough,
but he's not mean.

853
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,779
He sure loves you.

854
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,652
This really is
a beautiful spot.

855
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,557
I feel really
comfortable here
with you.

856
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:03,060
Do you
come here often?

857
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,298
You know,
you have been
really great.

858
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:11,202
I mean,
this whole thing
has turned out...

859
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,671
so well.

860
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:17,308
I was just wondering
if there was something

861
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:20,111
I could do for you?

862
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:24,615
Hmm. You could teach me
some more about music?

863
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:27,785
- Jerk.
- ( laughs )

864
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,189
So is that what you
really want to be?
A musician?

865
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:34,125
Well, I do love
to play,

866
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,194
yeah, but composing--

867
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:38,596
I mean, the rush
you get creating music,

868
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:42,833
it's the closest a man
can come to creating life.

869
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:46,171
With a piece of paper
and your imagination,

870
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,374
you can touch people
with a part of your soul

871
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:52,310
and hearing it,
they somehow
recognize themselves.

872
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:56,814
Or at least that's
what the guys

873
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,883
on the MTV
interview say.

874
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,651
- Yeah, right.
- Oh!

875
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:02,620
Oh! What's the matter?
Did I hurt you?

876
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,822
It's just a bruise
from the fight.

877
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,891
Well, listen,
my secure area
of competence

878
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:10,228
- is medicine, so--
- No, it's okay.

879
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,663
Look, why didn't you tell me?
You could have cracked a rib.

880
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:16,801
You know, I think
I've thought of something
you can do for me.

881
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:20,838
Oh, yeah?
What?

882
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,935
( playing softly )

883
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:14,692
What is that
you're playing?

884
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:19,830
It's beautiful.
Did you write this?

885
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,899
For you.

886
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:36,213
( music ends )

887
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:56,401
No, thank you.

888
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:59,737
I like to know
what's really
happening.

889
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,274
Okay.
I think
you'll like it.

890
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:17,755
Relax.
Leave everything to me.

891
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:50,855
- I don't wear cologne.
- Yeah, but I nicked you

892
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,857
and this will
disinfect it.

893
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,060
Ah.
Ouch.

894
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,033
One more thing.
Can you crack my back?

895
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,102
Yes, I can.

896
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,804
Can you turn around?

897
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,975
All right,
cross your arms.

898
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:12,910
Take a deep breath.

899
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,779
Blow it out
and drop your head.

900
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:18,048
Ooh!

901
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,851
Thank you.
Now go to bed.

902
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,521
Go on.

903
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:47,111
Are you sure
you want me here
in your room?

904
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:50,347
Yes.

905
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:58,389
Leave the light on.
I wanna see you.

906
00:55:58,423 --> 00:56:00,057
You're beautiful.

907
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:03,360
I'll be more beautiful
in the moonlight.

908
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:09,066
Moonlight is romantic.
It's kind.

909
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:32,156
What's wrong?

910
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:40,631
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

911
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,870
( switch clicks )

912
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,472
Then kiss me.

913
00:56:56,647 --> 00:57:00,618
Keith!
Where the hell
are you?

914
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:05,189
Keith!

915
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:07,124
Keith, what did you
find out?

916
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,059
Why didn't you 
 wake me up?

917
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,995
Courtesy, Mike.

918
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,464
Good friends
don't wake up
good friends

919
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:15,466
when good friends
are asleep.

920
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,469
A good friend don't wake up
a good friend when he's awake.

921
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:20,204
It's a waste of energy.

922
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:23,474
Well, you
got me there, partner.
I'll contemplate that.

923
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:25,042
Come on, Keith,
this is important.

924
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,111
I think Garnet
really likes this guy.

925
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:28,979
The whole town
likes him.

926
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,516
Hell,
I might even like him
a little bit myself.

927
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:33,951
Well, everybody in Denver
likes him, too.

928
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:37,087
He's had nine jobs
in two years

929
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,189
and nobody said 
 a bad word against him.

930
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:40,491
Well, that's good.

931
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:43,160
Not really.

932
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:46,030
She slickered you, Mike.
She pulled a fast one.

933
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,098
Slickered me?
Who pulled a fast one?

934
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:52,002
Garnet, who else?
She hired him.

935
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,605
Hired him
to do what?

936
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,275
Oh--

937
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,745
his sister works
for an escort agency.

938
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,713
And his landlady said
that he's taken up

939
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:05,650
with some high-toned
L.A. woman to go out
and make movies.

940
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,284
Now goodbye.

941
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,286
- He's got a girl in L.A.?
- ( Keith moans )

942
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,789
( mutters )
Got a girl in L.A.

943
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,525
We'll see about this.

944
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,295
A man comes in here
and thinks he can fool
everybody...

945
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,299
( mutters )
...think about that.

946
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,669
- ( gunshot blasts )
- ( screams )

947
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,538
You nuts?
You know I don't like guns!

948
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:29,574
My whole family
don't like guns!
They're loud!

949
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:32,743
- What's the matter with you? 
- Good mornin', glory.

950
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:35,179
Now that I got
your attention,

951
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,582
I want all the details.

952
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:40,651
( birds chirping, 
 faint cooing )

953
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,239
Morning.

954
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:05,710
Hi. What are you doin' up?

955
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:10,114
It's vaccination day
out on the reservation.

956
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,583
I've got children
to stab.

957
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:14,719
- Oh.
- Wanna come along?

958
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:20,257
No, I bit a doctor once
for vaccinating--
my kid sister.

959
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,628
- Recently?
- Nope, it was
way last year.

960
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,601
Well, how about hanging
around the house

961
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:33,337
and I'll
meet you back here
at around 5:00?

962
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:39,677
Don't wanna miss
the dance.

963
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,763
Um, Garnet!
I, uh...

964
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:00,865
I need to tell you
something.

965
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,768
I...

966
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,836
I-I don't know
what it is

967
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:09,173
about this place
or about you,

968
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:10,340
but I feel
differently

969
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:14,378
than I ever
felt before.

970
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:17,748
I hope that's
a compliment.

971
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:20,317
Were you making love
to me last night?

972
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,653
You couldn't tell?

973
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:24,922
Oh, gosh, I knew
I was a little rusty, but--

974
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,157
I'm in love
with you.

975
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,229
Are you sure
that's not going
just a little beyond

976
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,831
your professional
border?

977
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:36,366
We need to talk
about that, too.

978
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,771
But first,
I need to know
how you feel.

979
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,710
I feel wonderful.

980
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:50,380
I'm really grateful.

981
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:01,191
More than that,
I'm glad that you're here.

982
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,864
Well, does
the word "love"
come in here at all?

983
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:14,171
Oh, I think that word
gets abused a lot.

984
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,406
But I-- I do have
feelings for you.

985
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,847
Yeah, I could be
falling for you.

986
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:30,254
I am falling
for you...

987
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:32,723
despite
your occupation.

988
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:37,394
So this doesn't have
to end after tomorrow?

989
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:42,399
Oh, um, you'll find
that I don't like

990
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,401
letting go
of a good thing.

991
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,204
So you don't mind
if I stick around?

992
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:49,439
I'd like that.

993
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:53,443
( door opens, closes )

994
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:56,013
Yes! Yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

995
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,815
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yeah, come on!

996
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,898
I want the truth
and I want it right now.

997
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,467
What the hell is this?

998
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,469
I love Garnet.

999
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,005
I don't know
if she loves me.

1000
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:02,940
This is how
I'm gonna find out.

1001
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:04,641
By gettin' rid
of my son's things?

1002
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:09,479
I'm not gonna stand by
and let you put my son
on a trash heap.

1003
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,581
The right thing to do
is to bury your son.

1004
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:13,450
She can't do it,
so I am.

1005
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:16,153
You are?
Well, I know about you.

1006
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,989
She hired you
from one of those
escort services.

1007
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:21,858
That's not
exactly right.

1008
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,962
But what is true
is that I love her.

1009
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:27,631
I can make her happy.
Isn't that what you want?

1010
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:30,067
Maybe you're afraid
to see her with another man.

1011
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,137
You just watch
your step there, boy.

1012
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,372
I can still
kick your butt.

1013
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,975
You could do that.

1014
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:40,077
Or you could help me
take these things
outta here.

1015
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,952
It needs to be done.

1016
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:50,387
You think so, huh?

1017
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,369
Michael was
in great form
that day.

1018
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,640
Must have been
quite a guy,
your son.

1019
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:12,109
( softly )
Yeah.

1020
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:19,549
( sighs )

1021
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,086
Well, I guess this would
look pretty silly

1022
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,188
on another guy's
mantelpiece.

1023
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,695
If you do her wrong,

1024
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:36,633
I'm gonna be all over you
like ugly on an emu.

1025
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,635
Okay.

1026
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,941
Damn!
( thumps )

1027
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,230
( sniffles )

1028
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:10,100
Let's get this stuff
in my truck,

1029
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:12,569
take it out
to the ranch.

1030
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,012
Come on.

1031
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:24,581
( door opens )

1032
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:42,699
Excuse me?

1033
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,168
- Hi.
- Hi.

1034
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,503
I'm looking for the man
who drives that car.

1035
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:49,639
Oh, you just missed him.
He took off here a moment ago
with Mike Hadley.

1036
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,576
Oh, is he staying here
with Mr. Hadley?

1037
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,578
Oh, no, no.
He's staying
with Garnet.

1038
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,180
That's Mike's
daughter-in-law.

1039
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:01,085
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my, indeed.

1040
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:02,586
I don't know
where they went,

1041
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,154
but you can wait here
for them if you want,

1042
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,556
or they'll be at the dance
this afternoon.

1043
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,559
- The dance?
- Yeah.

1044
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:11,628
Why don't you tell me
about the dance?

1045
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:31,315
Hey!
Sorry I'm late.

1046
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,250
Robbie Windsong
bet Darpine Lewis

1047
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:35,185
that he could kick
a cactus so fast

1048
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,620
that it wouldn't stick.

1049
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:39,323
Robbie's out
a quarter.

1050
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:41,758
- Bryan: Is that for me?
- Garnet: It's a dreamcatcher.

1051
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,794
We better get
to the dance
by 6:00.

1052
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,830
Next to the spring
stock auctions,

1053
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:49,699
this is the social
event of the season.

1054
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,102
Everybody will be there.

1055
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:55,839
And if we're late,
all the food will be gone.

1056
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:59,543
( playing softly )

1057
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,134
( music continues )

1058
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:29,639
( slams )

1059
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,713
What have you done
with my things?

1060
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:39,783
- They're not here anymore.
- They belong to me.

1061
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,685
You have no right
to touch them,

1062
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:45,289
let alone
move them anywhere.
Where is everything?

1063
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:47,291
It's gone, Garnet.
But I'm here.

1064
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:49,826
Get away from me.
Where did you
put my things?

1065
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,328
You mean
Michael's things?

1066
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,397
You dress me up
in Michael's clothes,

1067
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,932
you make me smell like him
and you make love to me
in the dark.

1068
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,168
You want me to be Michael,
but I can't be him.

1069
01:08:58,202 --> 01:08:59,603
Yeah, well,
you got that right.

1070
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,937
Michael's gone.

1071
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,707
Let that end
and start something new.

1072
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,709
It won't be the same,
but it could work.

1073
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:08,612
Well, I'm not gonna
love and lose again.

1074
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:12,182
- I loved Michael
and he died.
- Anybody can die.

1075
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:14,184
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
let that happen to me.

1076
01:09:14,218 --> 01:09:16,220
Will you listen
to yourself? You're
supposed to be a doctor.

1077
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:17,954
And you're supposed
to be a whore.

1078
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,890
- I'm no whore.
- Oh, did we touch
a nerve?

1079
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:23,193
- Listen to me...
- Well, I don't think
someone like you

1080
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:24,728
- could even conceive
of what you're doing.
- I'm not an escort.

1081
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,863
That's not what I do.
I'm a composer.

1082
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,165
- Oh, is that
what you call it?
- I'm Jill's brother.

1083
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:32,736
You're what?

1084
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:36,206
( sighs )
I was doing her
a favor.

1085
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,642
Favor?

1086
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,881
So this whole thing
has been one big lie?

1087
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,717
No, it hasn't
been a lie.

1088
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,454
Do you two do this
sort of thing often?

1089
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:52,689
She wanted you
to have the best.

1090
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,891
Oh, "the best"?!
You are so arrogant.

1091
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,893
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, 
I didn't tell you earlier,

1092
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,895
all right? I'm sorry!

1093
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:03,933
I'm sorry.

1094
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,835
I wanted to
a number of times.

1095
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:10,507
Yeah, so why
didn't you?

1096
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,311
I guess I started
to like the job.

1097
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,817
If you want,
I'll leave now.

1098
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:24,788
- I mean, if that's
what you want.
- Uh-uh. No.

1099
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,391
You have two hours with me
at the Bison Ball.

1100
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:29,025
I don't care
if I see you
at the dance,

1101
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,960
but you take me there
and you bring me home.

1102
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:39,336
So no one can
get near you, huh?

1103
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:43,273
We had a deal.
I paid my dime.

1104
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,942
You finish the dance.

1105
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,278
You're gonna throw
everything away
with or without me.

1106
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:51,748
Yeah, well, I guess
you're the expert at
throwing things away.

1107
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,483
I didn't
throw anything away
that would keep you

1108
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,419
from being
happy tomorrow.

1109
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,527
Neither did I.

1110
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,995
( footsteps fade )

1111
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:08,465
( door slams )

1112
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:18,775
( slams )

1113
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:22,379
( slams )

1114
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:25,882
( music playing )

1115
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,356
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.

1116
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:35,091
- How you doin'?
- Just great, Pop.

1117
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,827
How are you?

1118
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:39,829
What did you think
about the housecleanin'?

1119
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:47,437
It was the right
thing to do.

1120
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,373
I helped him 
 move the boxes.

1121
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:55,845
Well, I hope you two

1122
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:58,548
feel really good
about yourselves.

1123
01:11:58,582 --> 01:11:59,949
Excuse me.

1124
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:05,389
- Judy, can I borrow
your man?
- Sure.

1125
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:09,993
I've lost her, Mike.

1126
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,995
Had to be done.

1127
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,564
Now she'll heal.

1128
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,067
Not for me.

1129
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,587
Hello, Bryan.

1130
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:40,424
Jenny.
What are you
doin' here?

1131
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:42,526
Looking for you.
Wasn't easy.

1132
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:44,994
Jillian wouldn't tell me
where you went or why.

1133
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,064
I got worried when
you didn't return
my calls.

1134
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,400
How did you find me?

1135
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:52,569
Your landlady
told me.

1136
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:54,070
You told her
when you cancelled

1137
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,506
some kind of Sunday
dinner date with her?

1138
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:01,945
Well, you don't seem
very pleased to see me.

1139
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:06,616
As a matter of fact,
I'm very pleased to see you.

1140
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:08,051
You look sensational.

1141
01:13:10,654 --> 01:13:11,655
Dance?

1142
01:13:13,457 --> 01:13:15,425
You bet.

1143
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:19,863
( uptempo 
 music playing )

1144
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,870
Do you think if you
loosened up, it would rain?

1145
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,004
What's the matter
with you, Keith?

1146
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:31,107
I don't like
country music.

1147
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,443
How come you're not
dancing with Jemsen?

1148
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:35,479
Oh, hell,
not you, too.

1149
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:36,913
I hear he's
a real nice guy.

1150
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:38,014
I didn't know
you'd met him.

1151
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,116
I didn't,
but I like him.

1152
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,586
He's got itchy feet
and our people like
that sort of thing

1153
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,053
'cause we used to
move around a lot.

1154
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:47,624
- Can we change
the subject?
- All right.

1155
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:51,595
So, you know,
back in the old days,

1156
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:54,130
my people would say
that you're binding
your husband

1157
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:56,032
in time that's already
spent and used up,

1158
01:13:56,065 --> 01:14:00,003
that you're keeping him
from moving on to
the spirit world.

1159
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:02,171
I guess if you're
a Christian, you'd say
that he was in hell

1160
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:05,208
- and you're
holdin' him there.
- And you believe that?

1161
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,478
Maybe.
I don't know.

1162
01:14:08,512 --> 01:14:10,146
Well, it doesn't seem
like your tribe

1163
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,715
has a lot of respect
for the dead.

1164
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:13,717
( Keith laughs )

1165
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,153
On the contrary,
we have a great deal
of respect for the dead.

1166
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,656
We just think
that live folks
are better company.

1167
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:22,626
Well, I don't want
anyone else, okay?

1168
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:26,129
I just want--
I just wanna go home.

1169
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:30,233
Phew.
I tried.

1170
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,604
So what you're
telling me is this
was just a job.

1171
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:36,506
Well, we needed the money
for my mom's therapy

1172
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:39,142
and Jill also thought
that I could help her.

1173
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,944
And you're sure
it's not more
than that?

1174
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,512
- I'm sure.
- Mm-hmm.

1175
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:44,648
But I don't have
to believe this.

1176
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,650
Don't worry about it.
She hates my guts.

1177
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:50,554
Really?
Well, I love you.

1178
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:53,156
Excuse me,
I'm ready to
go home now.

1179
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:55,091
It's your dime, boss.
After this dance.

1180
01:14:55,124 --> 01:14:56,693
Will you stop
calling me that?

1181
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,528
Okay, Jenny knows
everything.

1182
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:01,030
I'm leaving
with her tonight.

1183
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:02,566
Jenny?

1184
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,568
Yeah, Jenny.
That's her name.

1185
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,773
- That wasn't so bad.
- I guess.

1186
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:12,008
Jenny:
 I thought she'd be 
 sad to see you go.

1187
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,611
Bryan:
 No, that's not 
 an issue with Garnet.

1188
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,247
- ( thumps )
- Oh!

1189
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:19,549
( music stops )

1190
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,150
Leaving with
her tonight?

1191
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,553
Boy, you sure didn't
waste any time, did ya?

1192
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:25,121
And what's it
to you?

1193
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:28,091
Um... gosh,
I think you said
you loved me?

1194
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,093
It doesn't mean anything
unless you love me back.

1195
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:32,095
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

1196
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,731
You loved anything like
Michael you saw in me.

1197
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:38,134
Uh, he wrote me a song,
you move clouds.

1198
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:41,204
- That's not like Michael.
- Yeah, and you might have
wanted to love me for it.

1199
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:43,707
I mean, some women
might have thought
that was kinda nice!

1200
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,242
- Women: Yeah!
- But you chickened out.

1201
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,712
I gave you a piece of me
and you went upstairs

1202
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:50,246
and made love
to a dead guy.

1203
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,215
You're afraid 
 to love me or anybody.

1204
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:53,549
You're afraid!

1205
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:01,190
You're afraid.

1206
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:08,064
Well, I owe you this.
Come on.

1207
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,268
Man: Come on.
Let's get go see
what's goin' down.

1208
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,237
- Jenny: Bryan!
- Man #2: Hurry up!
Come on, let's go.

1209
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:18,041
Where are you
taking me?

1210
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,242
Come on.

1211
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:34,724
( moos )

1212
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:48,371
I'm not gonna
let you do this.

1213
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:50,173
This is crazy.
He's my bull.

1214
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,808
I know what
you're up to.

1215
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:54,143
You sure you wanna
go through with this?

1216
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:56,379
Is there any way to hold on
to that bull for a minute
so I can climb on?

1217
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:59,148
Yeah, we got a chute
over there but he'd
probably kick it down.

1218
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:01,150
( chuckles )
I'll get some
ropes on him.

1219
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,119
Come on, boys!
Let's get him
in the chute.

1220
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:04,888
No! This is insane.
This isn't gonna
change anything.

1221
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:07,757
All you're gonna do
is get yourself broken up.

1222
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:10,126
I brought you out here
to show you something.

1223
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,195
No, you stupid ox.

1224
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:13,830
Pop, you're not
gonna help him.

1225
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:15,631
Man:
 Hey, bull! 
 ( whistles )

1226
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:20,336
Bryan, somebody just
told me that that animal

1227
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,772
killed that woman's husband.
Now, you can't do this.

1228
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:24,240
I'll be fine.
It's something
I have to do.

1229
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:25,875
No, you don't.

1230
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:27,811
Look, I have an
interest here, too.

1231
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:29,312
Now, I know you think
it's noble or something,

1232
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:31,347
but she doesn't
need this.

1233
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,650
Right now she needs me
more than anybody
in the world.

1234
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:39,355
I'm going
to the car now.

1235
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,925
If our future
means anything at all
to you, Bryan,

1236
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,828
you'll come with me.

1237
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:48,197
Jenny...

1238
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:50,700
I'm not in love
with you

1239
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:52,769
the way
I should be.

1240
01:17:52,802 --> 01:17:55,939
It wouldn't be fair
not to love you
the best that I can.

1241
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:01,277
I'm sorry.

1242
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:09,252
Good luck, Bryan.

1243
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:16,960
- ( bull bellows ) 
- Man: Make him come to you!

1244
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:21,831
- Man: Open the slide! 
- Man #2: Watch his flank!

1245
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,933
- Yes.
- You've gotta
stop him, Pop.

1246
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:25,501
Man:
 Pull!

1247
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,970
He can take a look.

1248
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:28,471
Hey, bull.
Hey, bull.

1249
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:30,206
- All right, shut that gate!
- Easy, easy now.

1250
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,341
Keith:
Here, put this on.

1251
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,778
- Is there anything
I have to know?
- Keith: Too late now.

1252
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:36,813
Yeah,
there's a damn sight
you need to know,

1253
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:40,216
but for right now,
just take a tight wrap

1254
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:42,919
and keep 
 your weight back.

1255
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:46,289
How do I get him to stop
if I wanna get off?

1256
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:48,958
( men laughing )

1257
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:50,827
Just keep your heels high
and your weight in the middle.

1258
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,395
Here.
Put this on.

1259
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,230
At least you look like
you know what you're doing.

1260
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:56,332
( bellows )

1261
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,467
I'm not gonna
watch this.

1262
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:02,205
- Keith: Got your seat?
- I have no idea.

1263
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,941
( grunts )

1264
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,910
All right,
let him buck.

1265
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:09,245
- Man: Come on!
- Bryan: Yah!

1266
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:12,248
- ( crowd cheering )
- Ooh, oh! Whoa!

1267
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:13,282
Oh!

1268
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:18,988
- Hey, Garnet, you watching?
- Are you done yet?

1269
01:19:19,022 --> 01:19:22,959
I guess not.
Grab him again, boys.

1270
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,460
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1271
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,295
Woman:
 Go, Bryan!

1272
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,367
- Whoa! Oh!
- ( crowd cheering )

1273
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,437
Whoa!

1274
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:41,044
- Will you please
stop this?
- No.

1275
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,346
I'm begging you.
Don't do this to me.

1276
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,448
Sorry.
I can't stop now.

1277
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,884
Can't?
You mean you won't.

1278
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:50,854
And you want me to believe
that you love me.

1279
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:54,023
You selfish, pigheaded,
inconsiderate son of a bitch.

1280
01:19:54,057 --> 01:19:56,492
- I'm doing this for you.
- No, you're not.

1281
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,261
If you cared
about me at all,

1282
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,996
you wouldn't do something
that could kill you.

1283
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:03,833
Just like Michael!
You think that he cared,
then he loved me?

1284
01:20:03,867 --> 01:20:06,002
Well, damn
the both of you!

1285
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,007
( gate bangs )

1286
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,441
Hey.

1287
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:17,346
You okay?

1288
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:18,481
I gotta finish
what I started.

1289
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:20,416
I think maybe
you should quit.

1290
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,418
( grunts )

1291
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:23,552
Are you ready?

1292
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:29,425
- ( bull bellows )
- ( crowd cheering )

1293
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,866
Ah!

1294
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,501
All right,
that's enough.

1295
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:39,635
That's enough!

1296
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,537
Are you hurt?

1297
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,040
- Are you okay?
- ( moans )

1298
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,875
Are you blind?

1299
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,343
My arm feels like
it's been ripped off.

1300
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,045
My testicles ache
and I'm bruised all over,

1301
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:52,015
but you're missin'
the point-- I'm alive.

1302
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:54,350
I can still die.

1303
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:57,453
You still think by dying
Michael deserted you.

1304
01:20:57,486 --> 01:21:02,125
He didn't.

1305
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:05,028
Love doesn't die.

1306
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:07,330
Don't you get it?

1307
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:13,937
You don't get it.

1308
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:50,106
( car engines start )

1309
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,661
Give you a ride home
if you want one.

1310
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:36,485
( sighs )

1311
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,603
Hey, Cuddles.
Hey!

1312
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,311
Come on.

1313
01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:46,315
Go on now.
Leave me.

1314
01:24:46,349 --> 01:24:48,651
I don't need you
anymore.

1315
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:50,686
Go on!

1316
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,755
Good boy.

1317
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,826
Wait.

1318
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:03,199
Go get a horse
and take a rope.

1319
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:10,873
You just released
about a ton of grief
in the neighborhood.

1320
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:12,708
You wanna help us
get it back?

1321
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:15,211
I don't want him anymore.

1322
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:30,326
( piano music playing )

1323
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:05,894
- Have a nice evening.
- Thanks.

1324
01:26:22,445 --> 01:26:24,713
- ( music ends ) 
- ( applause )

1325
01:26:24,747 --> 01:26:26,715
Thank you.

1326
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,325
Is there something
you wanna hear?

1327
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:40,396
Yes, there is.

1328
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:44,700
You know, a guy
can get seriously injured

1329
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:47,303
playing what
she wants me to play.

1330
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:49,672
I'd still
go for it.

1331
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:53,509
I'm not sure
I can manage again.

1332
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:57,846
Exhausted me.
Left me drained.

1333
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,517
Yeah, but you're
still alive.

1334
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,686
I'm here.

1335
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:09,292
So what's your request?

1336
01:27:20,303 --> 01:27:22,004
Can you play this?

1337
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:29,978
Yeah, I know this one.

1338
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:37,886
( plays slowly )

1339
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:49,998
Please.

1340
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,036
One more time.

1341
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:58,841
Push the clouds around.

1342
01:28:10,486 --> 01:28:14,923
( playing softly )

1343
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:20,423
( piano music playing )
