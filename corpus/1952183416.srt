1
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:07,998
They stopped.

2
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,821
- Which one?
- 7.

3
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:12,621
Start the stopwatch.

4
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:16,567
- Is he okay?
- Yes, fine.

5
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:19,772
Stop.

6
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,405
What does that mean?

7
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:26,181
Nothing ...
... there

8
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:33,483
Well, the logic is, when forced into an aversive situation
i.e. being dumped into a pool

9
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,415
the rat will oscillate between attempts to escape
and resigning to its fate.

10
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,842
and resigning to its fate.

11
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,979
- And this guy gave up
- Today he did. 

12
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:46,060
- Does he usually?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:50,912
I'm trying to quantify 
how helpless this one feels

14
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,932
and why more today than yesterday.

15
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:57,014
But it seems Mr. 7 is always
a little bit of a quitter.

16
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:06,119
- Umm, could you sign this for me, Larry?

- Sure

17
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,201
- Thank you.
- This is my friend Brian Weathersby

18
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:12,653
- Hi
- Hi Brian, nice to meet you.

19
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:14,798
- Do you work here?
- No

20
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:16,527
We went to college together.

21
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:20,476
- Really? He looks so much older than you.
- Thanks so much.

22
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:26,493
This is a PhD candidate in neurobiology 
She's studying aggression and sexual behaviour e

23
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,280
in Mongolian gerbils.
- Yeah, I just play with gerbil dick all day.

24
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:32,265
Really?

25
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,463
No, uh ... just their brains. 

26
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:43,075
I'm sorry, that was really weird.
- Little bit.
Uhm, I'm gonna go. It was nice to meet you.

27
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:45,361
I'm sorry again.

28
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:51,694
She had any idea how many times a day I masturbated 
thinking about her

29
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,266
... she'd probably sue the university.

30
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,597
- And she'd be right, it's inappropriate.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,101
So ... why do some swim
and others not? 

32
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,556
Oh, it's hard to say ...
I mean nobody knows

33
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:10,756
To what degree the rat feels helpless
What we do know is the drugs we administer to make the rats

34
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:15,804
Wanna swim more are the same drugs that make people,
feel less depressed.

35
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,907
- Antidepressants?
- Yup, antidepressants.

36
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:22,896
Do you know women are 20 times more likely
to be depressed than men?

37
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,658
Maybe more. Can't remember the exact number.
It's a lot more.

38
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:32,197
That's good ... for men.

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,799
Not really ... when you think about it heterosexually.

40
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:40,622
Right.

41
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,547
Enough, enough, enough ... stop stop stop!

42
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:59,898


43
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,909



44
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,764



45
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,622
Oh shit, what happened to you?

46
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,278
Pickup game,
caught an elbow.

47
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,279
Black dude?
White dude?

48
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,651
Definitely white.

49
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:18,108
Hey Kevin, lunch.

50
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,587
Hey look, got some mini burgers
a whole bunch if you want some.

51
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:26,672
Wassup dude not much.
- Hey Kevin

52
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,987
- Want some?
- No, I'm good.

53
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,826
How did you make out with the 
Wall Street guy?

54
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,428
Uhh, I think I sold him 5 beds.

55
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,062
5 beds? 
Why does he need 5 beds for?

56
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,546
He's got 5 bedrooms.

57
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,214
Smart.

58
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:45,040
Came in looking for some beds
for his new mansion

59
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,516
I asked him how his bonus season went.
- Yeah, and ...?

60
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,142
He cackled, squealed like a pig.
Fucking guy's 28.

61
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,502
What's bonus season?

62
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:59,687
Every year banks give out bonuses, y'know, big bonuses
a couple of mil.

63
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,068
I'm in the wrong industry.

64
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,732
Anyway, I got him up on that Scona
Made him take off his shoes, got him a cup of tea

65
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:16,206
He laid there for a couple of minutes .. I asked him
some questions about his job, reported bout his success

66
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:21,040
And bang ... 5 beds.
You could sell salt to a slug ...

67
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,660
... if you listen to the slug.

68
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:29,104
Ugh, this place depresses me. Don't like the idea.
- Stores?

69
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,095
Let me get you somebody to talk to.
- Oh Christ.

70
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,422
They will help, they know what they're talkin about.
- Ok, but i don't have all day for speeches

71
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,552
I want a fucking bed.

72
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:37,632
Hold on.

73
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,855
Hi, can I help you?
- Uh yes, my boss is looking for a bed.

74
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,978
Okay ...
- And he doesn't have a ton of time.

75
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,730
This bed feels like it's full of cookie dough.

76
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:57,180
That's a horsehair-covered bed.
- It's a shit-covered bed that's what it is.

77
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:03,022
What's this?
- That's the Lady Englander Americanus Series 400

78
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:05,739
A salesman with a shiner.
I'm gonna believe him.

79
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,391
Better ...
feels like a plank though.

80
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:14,155
Uh here's some literature.
- I didn't just fall off the turnip truck, son.

81
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,661
Ok, uh tell you what,
if you have any specific questions

82
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,344
I'm happy to help
I'll be right over here.

83
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,803
No no no, you're on this ride with me
the poofter here

84
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,883
And I came here to buy a bed and I don't have time
to chase you down

85
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,698
your little videogame station.

86
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,960
And what you kids do all day.
Playing those tetris games pretending to work.

87
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,261
What's this?
A sarcophagus?

88
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:39,921
Um, that's the Scona Sangar 770 series
3000 coil count

89
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:43,121
Best bed on the market.
Swedish.

90
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,598
That was a joke.

91
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,189
Yup, good one.
Try it out, Gary.

92
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,639
C'mon, not gonna touch you.

93
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:56,228
Don't have to be shy in front of me,
I know how you spend your weekends

94
00:08:57,093 --> 00:09:02,276
Bunch of homos out there on Fire Island piling on top of each other. It's disgusting.
- It's nice.

95
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:08,386
Yeah. Bet you wish you had a couple of these out there
Get all your buddies together.

96
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,334
Have a disgusting orgy.

97
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:12,970
I bet you wish you could come.

98
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,776
Alright, get up.

99
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,645
Alright, what's the story on this thing?

100
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,093
Uh, it's the last bed you'll ever buy.

101
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,671
Only bed I ever bought, how much?
- $14,000

102
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:28,873
American? It's a lot of money
for a goddamn bed.

103
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:34,415
Alright, I'll send my girl by this afternoon
take a look

104
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,067
Work out the financing.

105
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:38,784
14 grand is the price you quoted me
not a penny more

106
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,679
So don't try to Jew the price up on me.
You're not Jewish, are you?

107
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,472
No, I'm not.
- Good.

108
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,028
It's just a figure of speech,
I'm half Jew myself

109
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,995
I work with Jews, they Jew me all day long
so I can say it.

110
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,014
Ok, um there's shipping and handling

111
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,073
No. 14 grand, work it out Chester.

112
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,778
Let's go Gary, this place depresses me.

113
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:00,937
You going where and for what now?
And when you leaving?

114
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,934
Vancouver, right? - Vermont
That was close.

115
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,604
My father's 80th birthday.
- 80th? Damn.

116
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,226
Your brother's going?
- Yup.

117
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,786
Hi.

118
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,595
Hi.

119
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,189
Can i help you?

120
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,928
Yeah, um, my dad ...
he came in here earlier

121
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,024
And talked to someone about a bed

122
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,375
Ok.

123
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,374
He came in ... 
he came in here with another guy.

124
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,204
Um, big guy?
- No, gay.

125
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,560
I meant your dad?

126
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,954
Oh yeah, kind of sort of uh loud mouth

127
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,445
Yeah, the uh Scona bed you wanna see?


128
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,182
Yeah ...

129
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,868
Uh ... this way.

130
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,295
That's a great bed.

131
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,794
Made in Sweden.

132
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,132
Wow.
May I sit on it? 

133
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,543
Sure.

134
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,555
Ohh, this is a nice bed!

135
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,309
How much is it?
- $14,000

136
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:19,205
Holy shit!

137
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,196
Is this the one he wants?
- Mm hmm.

138
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,361
Fuck it, money gotta spin man.

139
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:30,690
Thank you.

140
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,365
Can I lie here for awhile?

141
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:37,568
Sure.

142
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,782
Thanks.

143
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,255
Can you see up my skirt? 

144
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:56,018
Not really.

145
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:59,135
Great. 

146
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,275
What happened to your eye?

147
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,765
Uhh, I was attacked by a homeless man.

148
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:23,134
I'm gonna get you a receipt
there's a warranty package

149
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:28,571
Built into the price, it's a pretty standard
25 year non-prorated deal

150
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:33,958
And for delivery
I guess I'll waive the fee

151
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,112
Because I told your dad ...

152
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,484
Or really he told me ... umm ..

153
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,784
<i>Family Initiative</i>

154
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,936
Kenyatta Folds, please.

155
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,601
I'm sorry, can you repeat the name?

156
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:23,274
Yes, can you please connect me to Kenyatta Folds
This is Brian Weathersby.

157
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:29,299
This is Kenyatta
- Hey Kenyatta, it's Brian

158
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,152
Oh hey, wassup man?

159
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,907
What's the name of those beds you make?

160
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:37,360
Ah well, we don't make them
but they're called Scona beds.

161
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:40,043
I looked them up,
that shit's expensive.

162
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,634
Yes, but truly excellent
sleeping devices.

163
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:47,165
Better be for that kinda money.
Wassup big boy?

164
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,743
Nothing, it's Friday, so uh,
I thought I'd call.

165
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:54,540
I got no news man,
they met on Wednesday ...

166
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:56,974
But nothing's changed.

167
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,690
What about the application and references
did that make it any further?

168
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:04,823
No.

169
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:08,889
Ok, I'm still interested in the
main adoption list

170
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:13,037
But can you keep me on the email list
and for alternative list as well?

171
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:15,258
All 3 lists?
- You know it, man.

172
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:15,875
Thanks.

173
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,443
Be safe.

174
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,642
Will do, bye.

175
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,317
Hey Brian,
who is that girl?

176
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:33,659
Uh, that, that guy,
the big guy who came in earlier

177
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:35,092
His daughter. es su hija.

178
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:37,786
He buy that bed?
- Yup.

179
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,598
Yeah, you see that's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.

180
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,547
So what's up with them Chinese people.

181
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:46,626
Uh, still no word.

182
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,839
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
Tell your papa I said Happy 80th.

183
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,357
I will.

184
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,388
How old was he when he had you?

185
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,665
Uh 52.

186
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,473
Damn.

187
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,962
Still shooting bullets at 52. 

188
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,789
I'm out.
- Ok.

189
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:36,068
I fell asleep on your bed.

190
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,634
How long was I asleep? 

191
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,347
Uh ..
2 and a half hours.

192
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,028
You must've been tired.

193
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,866
I've got your receipt here
and all the paperwork for the bed

194
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,300
You just need to tell me
when to deliver it.

195
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:00,900
Wait a minute ...

196
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,439
I had this fucked up dream ...

197
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:06,995
I was in a cave and my hair
was made out of marijuana

198
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,170
and then ...

199
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,622
my swim coach was um ...

200
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:19,660
And then ... we went to ...
are you adopting a dog?

201
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:21,385
No.

202
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,947
Oh, you were in my dream.

203
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,131
Do you ever incorporate things
into your dreams?

204
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:33,241
I was out of it.
What were we talking about?

205
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,419
Umm .. delivery...
when do you want it?

206
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:42,632
No, you were on the phone
you were talking bout somethin' ..

207
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:47,890
In the process of adopting
a baby from China.

208
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,201
Did you give me this?
- Yes.

209
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,163
Wow, that's amazing.

210
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:56,573
Well, it was right there on the bed ...

211
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,888
No, I meant the baby.

212
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:01,701
Oh, I don't have the baby yet

213
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:09,213
Yeah, you've to go through
a shit ton of tests, interviews

214
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:12,433
And there are a few categories where I'm not

215
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,120
An ideal candidate.

216
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,753
Do you mind me asking why?
- Not at all, I'm not married and I'm 28.

217
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:21,311
What would they rather have?
- Married and 30.

218
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,209
Are you gonna raise this kid?

219
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:28,635
That's the idea,
yeah if I ever get one.

220
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,825
So, how long have you
wanted to do that?

221
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:34,952
Pretty much my whole life.

222
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,966
So it's been a weird obsession.

223
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,927
Sorry I keep asking questions.

224
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:46,602
No, it's ok,
it's a little weird.

225
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,900
So do you actually deliver it?

226
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:54,220
The bed?

227
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:58,707
Oh no, the guys do it. 
The delivery guys.

228
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:02,703
Ok, well,

229
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:07,245
I guess I'll just come in tomorrow and ...

230
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:12,868
See what my dad wants.

231
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:19,301
Yeah sure, you just have to sign here
and you're good. 

232
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:24,161
I'm Brian, by the way.
- I'm Happy.

233
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,965
My name's Harriet, 
but everybody calls me Happy.

234
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,611
It's a nice name.

235
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,852
Which one?
- Harriet.

236
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,973
I like it.
- Me too.

237
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,947
Yes, so uh ..
- Shit. 

238
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:54,291
I'll talk to you tomorrow? 
- I'm late for work.
You going to work now?

239
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,658
Yeah, I'm a hooker.

240
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,142
I thought so.

241
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:00,437
I work for my sister, sort of.

242
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:08,194
I gotta go.
- Yes, good luck. 

243
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:12,255
Thanks for letting me sleep here.

244
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,701
Sure. 

245
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,341
Anytime, uh .. 

246
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,017
Yeah, that's looking good. 

247
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:30,377
Is it? 

248
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:34,586
Hell yeah.
Black hair ain't easy to deal with y'know.

249
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:38,602
Had a white stepfather had to deal with 
my sister's Afro coiffures 

250
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,630
She looked like a dog 
when he finished with 'em.

251
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:46,208
White people just don't know how difficult 
black hair's to deal with. 

252
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,174
Wassup dude not much. 

253
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:55,966
Y'know Kevin. 
That's two separate things. 

254
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,129
"What's up dude?" is the question.

255
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:02,068
"Not much" is the answer 
to that question. 

256
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:08,086
Listen dudes, I need someone to help me 
with that Scona delivery

257
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:11,702
For that guy with the fag friend 

258
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,908
I'm sorry, homosexual.

259
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:17,281
Where's Plume?

260
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:20,839
Well he called in sick dude. 
He's like ate some bad chicken

261
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:24,142
Parts and he's like honking his guts out.

262
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,421
Well get on Kumalo. 
- No, not today dude. Religion.

263
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:29,308
I'll do it. 

264
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:30,282
Sweet.

265
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,649
I'll call in a temp.
- No, no, no I don't mind.

266
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,187
Route 212, 93. Busca el 2903.

267
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:38,030
Right here.

268
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:40,252
Ok.

269
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:42,155
Sweet.

270
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:06,352
Happy!

271
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:07,873
What?! 

272
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,446
The door! 

273
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:25,596
Yeah? 
- Sandman mattress. It's the delivery.

274
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,128
Ok.
- Thanks.

275
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:32,063
Put some clothes on for God's sake.

276
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:50,447
Hello? 
- Yup.

277
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,505
We're delivering the mattress.

278
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:56,527
I'm lying on the kitchen floor.

279
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:59,812
Now that we both know what we're doing,
what's next?

280
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,234
Where can we set this up?

281
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:15,016
How about the bedroom area?

282
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:18,077
Right. 
Where is that, sir?

283
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:19,758
Happy!!!

284
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:26,324
Hi.
-Hi. 

285
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,801
The delivery guy got sick. 

286
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:31,069
Oh, ok, I'll show you. 

287
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:44,007
Wassup dude not much.

288
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:49,430
Kevin!

289
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:50,634
Coming. 

290
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:56,952
So, um, just, right there.

291
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,635
Happy.

292
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:05,321
Happy!!

293
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:07,204
What? Coming. 

294
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,279
I'm going to the back doctor today. 
- Ok.

295
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:20,923
I need you to drive me. 

296
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,510
No way. 

297
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,059
I'll give you $1000

298
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:26,820
Dad, I can't. 

299
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,875
Get that kid to do it.

300
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,326
Who? Brian?

301
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:35,705
Well we just can't ask him to do stuffs like that.
That's weird. 

302
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,735
Hey, I've kinda a weird question for you. 

303
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,066
What is it?

304
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:52,030
Will you drive my dad 
to the back specialist? 

305
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,196
I can't drive in New York City. 

306
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:01,210
A cab? 

307
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:03,480
He doesn't ride in cabs. 

308
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,110
Well, yes ... 

309
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:12,430
He'll pay you ... 
and I will come with you so it won't get too weird 

310
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:18,144
I really appreciate you doing this 
taking time off from work and all. 

311
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,254
Oh well.
- Oh, where the hell is she? 

312
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:27,205
Brian, I'm totally serious when I say she may've 
gotten lost leaving the apartment. 

313
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:35,021
Ooh, somebody got all glossied up.
Ow.

314
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,471
You play tennis, Brian? 

315
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:47,852
I've played, not much.
- I have the 9th fastest serve in the world. 

316
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,122
They clocked it.
Verified.

317
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:56,062
The doctor will meet you in Room 1. 
- Fabulous. Will be about an hour. 

318
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,115
Come on in now. 
- Ok.

319
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,032
Thanks. 

320
00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:37,638
Structurally, there are no abnormalities. 

321
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:41,936
This has to do with your musculature and your ligaments 
this has to be the last time we talk about this.

322
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,988
What about ruptured discs?

323
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:48,172
That is bullshit. All that shit is 
fucking fucking bullshit ok? 

324
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,301
Back disorders, duodenal ulcers,
the most misdiagnosed conditions

325
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,013
Attributed to middle-aged men today. 
I'm not going down that road. 

326
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,778
Stress, Al.

327
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:58,169
Tension.

328
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:01,052
Weariness, that's what causes 
most of this shit. 

329
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,638
Let me show you something. 

330
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,094
A little pressure. 

331
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,240
Look at that energy pattern. 

332
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,691
You look at it.
I'll go along with it ...

333
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,262
But I'm not fucking stressed.

334
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,877
What are you reading? 

335
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:25,830
It's an article about a Tibetan 
who plays basketball with some other 

336
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:27,406
Monks in Arizona.

337
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:35,128
Says they got in a fight with five advertising 
executives in front of a bunch of kids. 

338
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,568
What are you reading? 

339
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:43,948
Uhm ... mostly just ads. 

340
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:47,630
This one's for ... a ..

341
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:52,411
Meditation cushion ...
that's filled with buckwheat. 

342
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:55,978
And it costs $249 

343
00:27:57,357 --> 00:27:58,925
It's a cushion? 

344
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:04,523
Yeah, it's mostly just a pillow that 
looks like a stump. 

345
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:11,327
Seems like a lot. 
- Yeah. 

346
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,762
Do you have any interest in 
having sex with me? 

347
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,758
Yeah. 
- Really? 

348
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:35,777
Now.
- Mm hmm. 

349
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:12,401
I need to schedule another appointment, Linda. 

350
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,589
How was your visit, Mr. Lolly? 

351
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,688
A waste of money.

352
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:17,740
How about Thursday the 23rd? 

353
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:19,485
Nope. 
- The 24th? 

354
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,879
Yup. 
- 9:30?

355
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:23,042
No.
- 2:30

356
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:24,212
Yup.

357
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:34,074
Smells like a wharf nut in here.

358
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,221
What? 

359
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:38,121
You heard me. 
Smells like low tide. 

360
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:42,151
That's weird.
- I don't smell anything.

361
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:45,458
Hey, how was the doctor, dad? 

362
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:49,883
Yup, good enough quack. 
Charged a fortune but I've got his number. 

363
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,831
Did you know I had brain cancer once, Brian? 

364
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,572
No.
- Yup.

365
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,207
Yup, huge tumour on the 
recesses in my temporal lobe.

366
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,512
But you're ok now. 

367
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:08,823
Yup. 100% holistic. 
No chemo, no radiation.

368
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,894
What did you do? 

369
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:17,624
I mapped the pathology of the cancer with my mind. 
Very Chinese.

370
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:20,866
Yup.
Then I moved it. 

371
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,839
Again with meditation. 

372
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:27,074
I pushed it down to the fatty tissue 
of my temporal lobe 

373
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:28,508
2 months. 

374
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:32,371
Then I moved it down to my nasal cavity stream.
3 months. 

375
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:37,134
Then ...
then one day I just hocked it out. 

376
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:44,456
About the size of a squash ball, 
maybe bigger. 

377
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:45,766
Do you play squash, Brian? 

378
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,672
Yeah, I've played some squash. 

379
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:50,957
I was the No. 2 at Yale 
behind some Paki named Nasser. 

380
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:51,995
Dad. 

381
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,906
Uh. Pakistani.
The guy was a wire. 

382
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:15,718
Hey Brian
- Hi ...

383
00:31:15,753 --> 00:31:18,543
It's Missy.
- Right, gerbil cock, right? 

384
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:24,979
She wants you.
- Stop it. 

385
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,336
What's up in the rat world? 

386
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:34,354
Oh ... depression, sleep deprivation, 
test, the usual. 

387
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:36,945
What the fuck is that? 

388
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:40,544
This, is a sports drink. 

389
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,724
I'm hungover.

390
00:31:44,078 --> 00:31:46,891
How you doin' man? - 
- Ahh, well ... 

391
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:48,523
I got a problem. 

392
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,366
Yeah? What's going on? 

393
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:58,130
I had sex with this girl in the back 
of her father's station wagon the other day. 

394
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:01,642
Is it a sting when you pee 
kinda problem? 

395
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:03,136
No.

396
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,487
Expound.

397
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:09,123
Well ...
now what? 

398
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,525
Mmm ... well now there are 2 possible 
reactions to this scenario.

399
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,296
You either wanna bang it home again 
or you never wanna see her for the rest of your life.

400
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,998
Which is it? 

401
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,365
Bang it home? 

402
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:29,130
Why are you saying it
like it's a question? 

403
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:32,596
Bang it home. 

404
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:36,813
Yeah. There you go. 
Damn straight bang it home. 

405
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:39,003
Good job. 

406
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:41,145
Who is this girl? 

407
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,053
She came into the store the other day,
and her dad bought a bed.

408
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,342
God bless capitalism. 

409
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:50,146
So when's the next bang-bang gonna happen?

410
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,448
I don't know. 

411
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:54,639
You like her? 
You like her <i>like her?</i>

412
00:32:54,674 --> 00:32:55,789
I don't know. 

413
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:00,933
You think it's possible that the rat 
that stopped swimming was just tired

414
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,137
And taking a little break? 

415
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:05,108
Unlikely. 

416
00:33:05,143 --> 00:33:08,115
These calculations are based 
on months of testing, so ... 

417
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,672
The same rat that stopped swimming again and again 
is probably more than just a little tired.

418
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:15,703
How's the mattress business? 

419
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,125
I should get there. 
- Okay. 

420
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:23,451
Hey you ...
should ask Missy out.

421
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:26,336
Can't. Scared. 

422
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,318
Good luck. 
- Mmm ... you too. 

423
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:33,578
Hey, you gotta swim 
if you wanna bang it home.

424
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,531
That's reality. 
Remember that. 

425
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:38,271
I will. 

426
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:53,727
What's our first meal?
- Nothing.

427
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:55,492
Ah, c'mon,
I'm starving. 

428
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:58,029
Nah, it's better on an empty stomach. 

429
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:59,109
It's true. 

430
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:02,837
Crock. It's not. Yeah well I'm hungry
I'm gonna grab somethin' to eat. Brian you want somethin'? 

431
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:04,282
No, I'm alright. 

432
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:05,704
Excuse me, shaman. 

433
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,310
Dad, you need some help? 

434
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:14,830
Nope, I've got it. 

435
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:16,935
When are the shrooms ready? 

436
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,068
Oh no no no ... 
best to let it steep a while.

437
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:25,095
Talked to a local, he said there were alot
uh ahead of the woods 

438
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,719
And black trumpets south side of Temper
lower elevations than last year.

439
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,007
You bringing that? 

440
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,028
Yup. 

441
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,402
Might be some pheasant. 
- A pheasant with a death wish?

442
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:42,575
That's tradition. He brings a gun 
He doesn't use the gun.

443
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,313
He throws up. 

444
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,135
Thanks dad. 

445
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:53,598
Sometimes ... it takes mushrooms 
to find mushrooms 

446
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,447
Prepare your pouches 
for the poisoning. 

447
00:35:18,174 --> 00:35:24,130
Well, my hand is starting to look a bit 
like an eagle's claw. 

448
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:30,367
So I think it's time to pack our stuffs. 

449
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:41,752
Any news from China?

450
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:44,022
Uhm, not really. 

451
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:46,671
Same stuff, I'm on the list ...

452
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:50,287
A couple of years ... 
could be earlier. 

453
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,944
Yeah, well, listen, 
my friend Jin Ho 

454
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,738
Very powerful businessman,

455
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:59,732
Right here in the States

456
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:04,901
Owns an airline company, tobacco interests,
some crap like that 

457
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:10,030
And uh, he might, he might 
be able to help you.

458
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:13,032
Well, I think he's Korean, dad 
if that's what you mean. 

459
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:20,978
Yes, yes ... 
he's a marvelous Korean!! 

460
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:24,461
Of no help to you. 

461
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:25,990
Yeah, well ... 

462
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:28,118
I hope it happens. 

463
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:32,014
Be nice to have some 
new life in this family.

464
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,164
Hope you get the kid, yea. 

465
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,063
I think you'd be great at it. 

466
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:39,214
You think so? 
- I do, I do .... 

467
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:41,302
You got what it takes 

468
00:37:41,337 --> 00:37:43,762
What does it take? 

469
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,174
Well ... 

470
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:54,243
I haven't the foggiest idea,
to be truthful ... but ... 

471
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:56,221
Listen ... 

472
00:37:56,256 --> 00:38:00,711
Here we are, walking together
in the woods 

473
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:09,834
And if you can aspire 
to be walking in the woods with your kids

474
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:14,585
After they've made it as far 
as we've made it ... then ... 

475
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,938
I think you've done the right thing. 

476
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:20,295
That makes sense. 

477
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,199
It makes sense. 

478
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,899
Not really. 

479
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,104
But ... 

480
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:32,445
I think you understand me ... 

481
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,669
I do.

482
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:37,079
Dad! 

483
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,398
What the fuck?! 

484
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,297
Dad. 

485
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:40,964
Where the fuck did it come from? 

486
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,641
Are you alright?

487
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:45,790
Yeah yeah, I'm the war generation 

488
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,902
When we hear shots,
we get down. 

489
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:49,699
You guys are running 
around like targets. 

490
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:52,145
You sure you're okay? 
- Yeah yeah I'm fine. 

491
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,770
Looks like a tiny calibre bullet. 

492
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:55,346
Looks like a .22. 

493
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:58,722
Some hunter probably shot one 
across our bow. 

494
00:38:58,757 --> 00:39:00,249
Yeah, what's he hunting? 
Squirrel? 

495
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:03,935
He has a point. 
There shouldn't be anyone hunting right now. 

496
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,060
There's 2 ways we can go here 
we can hunt the fucker down ... sorry ... 

497
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,887
Or we can make our way back. 

498
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:10,781
Oysters. 

499
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:14,657
Huh ...
Check them golden oysters! 

500
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:17,096
Look at those beauties. 

501
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:19,420
Hey, what we gonna do about 
the long gun?

502
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:21,234
Nothing, nothing. 

503
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:25,896
We got our mushrooms, go back to our cabins
and call it a day. 

504
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:31,118
Then later, I'll take our bounty after hours, 
head back into town 

505
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:34,313
And have them cook us 
a proper meal. 

506
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:42,126
Ah, Bonjour mes amis.

507
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:54,577
Uh, you need any help? 

508
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,668
Brian, come to the kitchen.

509
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,603
I'd love to help. 

510
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,052
What's he sayin'? 

511
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:13,122
I'm going to help Jacques with the dinner
he thinks dad's a murderer in the kitchen.

512
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:15,378
What, everybody speaks French but me? 

513
00:40:29,102 --> 00:40:30,892
Jacques,
can we speak in English?

514
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,937
Ahh, I get carried away sometimes.

515
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:38,611
Whatever that boy wants, 
he'll figure it out at some point. 

516
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,841
And you've got 15 years on both of ya.

517
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,314
You forget what you were like 
when you were his age?

518
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:49,472
I was finishing my residency 
when I was his age. 

519
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:51,764
Yeah, I was in Russia 
buying oil tankers.

520
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:55,280
Yup, you look good. 
Very strong. 

521
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:59,548
Stronger than I have ever seen you. 
And I have seen you since you were a little uh ... 

522
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,308
uh ..."pizza".

523
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:06,099
Uh, you mean piss-ant?

524
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:07,866
Yeah yeah "piss-ant".
"Piss-ant".

525
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,596
Thanks. 
- You're welcome.

526
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:17,905
Well, that's for you Jacques, thanks for the hospitality
and for the Frenchness.

527
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:22,058
Thank you for the champignon 
and for being an absurd American. 

528
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:24,223
So, how will you get home? 

529
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:25,439
Brian.

530
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:26,387
I've got it. 

531
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:27,984
Are you okay to drive? 
- He doesn't drink.

532
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:28,955
No. 

533
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,660
I just don't drink 3 bottles of wine
on my own.

534
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:41,842
Jacques, you fabulous Frenchman! 

535
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,601
Thank you for suffering us. 

536
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:46,846
Been my pleasure. 
And don't forget to come back soon, huh? 

537
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:50,543
Merci monsieur
I don't kiss like that. 

538
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:53,535
You crazy Americans. 
- No kidding.

539
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,457
That means wait. 

540
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:01,988
Thanks dad. 

541
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:06,858
Langostas. You put them in the pot 
you boil them and you make a bisque. 

542
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:10,630
Watch your step. 

543
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:21,026
Lobsters, lobsters, lobsters, 
lobsters, lobsters ...

544
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:36,378
Ohh ... Aww, 
motherfucker! 

545
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:33,434
Whoa whoa whoa ... jailbreak huh?
Brian!

546
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:40,487
Is this a rueful act or a mistake?
Are you trying to free these things?

547
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:41,923
No!

548
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:46,421
I got a leg cramp.

549
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,201
I see.

550
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:07,962
What are you doing here?

551
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:10,025
Does it matter.
- Why?

552
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,274
I'm with my Japanese guys doing business.
Does my breath stink?

553
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,315
Yes.
- Damn.

554
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:23,098
Listen, I was talking to the big guy, Kanagae 
and he's got a brother who plays canasta

555
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,580
With some Chinese diplomats.
Would that interest you? 

556
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:27,923
What are you talking about?

557
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,212
Come over here. 

558
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:39,552
Ohh, my ass is in love with this bed.
- Yeah, this is the nicest one of the bunch.

559
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:40,690
Yeah, good.

560
00:44:42,394 --> 00:44:48,626
Anyway, so I talked to this guy Kanagae, 
and he claims ... y'know these people?

561
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:50,590
Yeah, they're customers. 

562
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,700
They're good? 

563
00:44:51,735 --> 00:44:53,311
They're cool. 

564
00:44:56,343 --> 00:45:01,227
He thinks he can get a healthy Chinese baby 
on the black market for like 45,000 US.

565
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:04,482
What? 
- Chinese. Like you want.

566
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:07,476
He's got these kind of connections. 
He's an oil man. 

567
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:11,315
Really? 
- So what do you think? 

568
00:45:12,372 --> 00:45:14,950
The black market?
- Yeah. 

569
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:16,979
It sounds kinda shady. 

570
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:20,719
Does it?
Or does it sound awesome?!

571
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:24,445
Right. 
It sounds like a bad idea.

572
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:28,330
Ok. 
Y'know, it's ... 

573
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:31,427
My little contribution, but um ... 

574
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:37,949
Parallel paths we pursue that way that's not working 
right now and I'll keep on going after my thing.
We'll see who wins.

575
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,864
Ok.
- Ok.

576
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:44,353
Hey, you mind if I crash here 
for a little bit? 

577
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:45,449
Knock yourself out.

578
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:49,030
Ohh, gotta love this fucking bed 


579
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:51,040
Hey Bri, you got laid recently 
didn't you?


580
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:52,627
And don't fucking lie to me either.

581
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:00,233
Hi. 
- Hi. 

582
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:02,684
I'm here to see Harriet Lolly? 

583
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,272
Happy?
- Yes.

584
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:08,951
Have a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable. 
There's coffee, Red Bull and Cheezos around the corner. 

585
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,776
Just over there.
- Thank you. 

586
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:19,157
Uh, Happy, you have a visitor. 

587
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:23,127
Dude ... sir, what's your name? 
- Brian Weathersby.

588
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:25,588
Brian, you heard it. 
Ok.

589
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,771
She'll be right out. 
- Thank you. 

590
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:31,358
You're welcome. 

591
00:46:58,112 --> 00:47:01,467
Hi ... what are you doing here? 
- Hi, uh, you said to stop by. 

592
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:03,918
Wow, nobody honours that system. 

593
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:06,670
So old-fashioned. 

594
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:09,621
Well, that's how I roll. 
- That's great. 

595
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:12,480
Are you really busy? Right now? I could come back ...
- No ... no ... I'm not ...

596
00:47:14,963 --> 00:47:17,618
I barely have a job,
so do you wanna see this? 

597
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:18,539
Sure. 

598
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:19,883
It's really fascinating. 
- Ok.

599
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:30,268
We're gonna have to lay low because my sister's 
on a warpath and she's a fucking sniper ... hey Doug. 

600
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:33,651
Oh, I'm sorry ...
Hello.

601
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,246
Why don't we do it like 
we always do? 

602
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:49,689
Hey Hap. 
- Hi Conner. 

603
00:47:50,843 --> 00:47:52,237
This is my friend Brian. 

604
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:53,779
Hey dude.
- Hi. 

605
00:47:53,814 --> 00:47:56,640
You look like her old boyfriend
Doesn't he? 

606
00:47:56,675 --> 00:47:58,676
Totally. 

607
00:47:58,711 --> 00:48:00,582
How do you guys know each other? 

608
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:03,238
Uhm, Brian sold my father 
a mattress.

609
00:48:03,273 --> 00:48:05,340
Oh, you work in the mattress store? 

610
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,929
Hey, you get me a good deal?

611
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:08,107
Probably not. 

612
00:48:08,142 --> 00:48:11,045
Your shoulder's a lil tight. 
Yo Kim...

613
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,502
Fuck! 

614
00:48:14,317 --> 00:48:15,558
I gotta jack. 

615
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:19,868
Oh, here's my sister.

616
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:20,863
Hi. 

617
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,636
I'm Melanie Lolly.
- Hi, Brian Weathersby.

618
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:29,000
I look like a fucking' mannequin 
in this thing, don't I? 

619
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:30,440
No, absolutely not. 

620
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,476
Melanie sort of hosts the show.

621
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,296
Congratulations. 
- Will you just go to the monitor and check and see 

622
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:36,702
If I look like a massive wall of grey
- Yes, yes ...

623
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:41,097
I do? 
- No, you don't ... yes, I'll look at the monitor. 

624
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:42,471
Thank you.

625
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:46,911
Uh, what is that? 

626
00:48:47,922 --> 00:48:49,236
Press the button. 

627
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,972
We sold like, 
800,000 of those things last year.

628
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:01,487
That's a uh ... 

629
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:06,593
Combination rape whistle, pepper spray 
mini brass knuckle key chain. 

630
00:49:06,628 --> 00:49:09,094
Yeah, you laughed 
when I used one of those once.

631
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:12,530
She peppered a drunk guy in the valet line 
He was really old.

632
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:14,252
He was an old perv.

633
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:16,068
So do I look huge? 

634
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:18,343
No, shut up.
- You shut up. 

635
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:23,244
... Wait I'm not saying that this doesn't make 
any sense to me, I don't really know what "smackdown" is.

636
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,303
Well, this has been interesting. 

637
00:49:38,151 --> 00:49:42,277
So, do you want to do something later? 

638
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,062
Sure. 

639
00:49:46,214 --> 00:49:51,246
I'm having dinner with my dad
if you wanna come? 

640
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,061
Please? 

641
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:57,301
Ok.

642
00:49:58,514 --> 00:50:01,139
Do I have to get dressed up? 

643
00:50:01,174 --> 00:50:02,572
Kinda. 

644
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:05,050
Ok.

645
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,652
I should check with work, though. 

646
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,778
Oh, are you open at night? 

647
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:14,571
Right 
... what?

648
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,702
It's called the Bobcat ... 

649
00:50:18,737 --> 00:50:24,680
It's on 62nd Street, 
7:30, it's kinda Frenchy.

650
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,267
You've got 2 hours and 45 minutes 
to get ready.

651
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:58,207
Sorry, I got a little lost. 

652
00:50:58,242 --> 00:51:01,825
Yeah, city's laid out in a perfect grid 
I can see how that can happen ...

653
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,007
Hi, I'm Brian. 

654
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,493
Ducky.

655
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:09,372
Brian, this is Ducky Settinstall. 
Ducky, meet Brian. 

656
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:11,603
He's recently started 
sleeping with my daughter. 

657
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:13,317
Albert.
- Dad. 

658
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:17,960
Am I incorrect? Please tell me if I'm being incorrect.
- Albert ...

659
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:22,809
Bobby, another bottle of Merlot please.

660
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:25,807
Brian, am I correct?

661
00:51:25,842 --> 00:51:27,757
Well, no. 

662
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:32,571
It's just been 
the one time in your car 

663
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:34,313
So if we do it again 

664
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:36,441
Then I think you could call it 
sleeping together, right? 

665
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:37,991
Fantastic. 

666
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:41,458
And how's the adoption going? 
Brian's in the middle of adopting 

667
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:42,644
A kid from China. 

668
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:45,622
Oh, so you would like ... 
- I don't get it. 

669
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:48,655
You've got fertile soil 
right next to you here.

670
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,479
Are you not planning on sticking around,
or is it an ammunition issue? 

671
00:51:51,514 --> 00:51:53,623
Dad?
- Harriet.

672
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:57,415
Why do you think you and Ducky 
don't make a formal commitment?

673
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:01,692
Is it because she works for you? 
You think it might be a conflict of interest 

674
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:03,732
So you just have
a hotel relationship? 

675
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:07,332
I think I'll have the lamb ...

676
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:10,877
... and a free sal salad ... 

677
00:52:10,912 --> 00:52:13,536
I think I'll have the clams. 

678
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:18,474
So ... seriously,
I'm ... I'm just interested.

679
00:52:18,509 --> 00:52:21,213
Suppose this Chinese baby plan works 

680
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:24,872
And you get the kid, 
what's the long term finance structure? 

681
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:27,748
Who's the mother? 
Who provides the feminine support? 

682
00:52:27,783 --> 00:52:30,167
What happens when the kid 
gets her period?

683
00:52:30,202 --> 00:52:32,054
I'm asking the tough questions. 
Go!

684
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,792
The long term finance structure? 

685
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:39,359
Yeah, I assume you make peanuts 
at the mattress factory, 

686
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:40,884
On a meagre salary? 

687
00:52:42,948 --> 00:52:45,726
Well, I guess we'll just 
eat less food.

688
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:50,270
They don't eat a lot in China anyway,
and they're much healthier so ... 

689
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:56,140
It'll be some cost-cutting measures
like that, less food, no heat, et cetera

690
00:52:56,656 --> 00:53:00,703
You won't be laughing 
when the tuition bills come in

691
00:53:00,738 --> 00:53:03,380
And she wants a horsie 
or he wants a Countach.

692
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,183
What's a Countach?

693
00:53:05,218 --> 00:53:09,068
It's ... it's a Lamborghini.
A car. 

694
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:14,443
Well, it sounds totally preposterous
somebody your age adopting a baby. 

695
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:16,745
No wife, 
No nothing.

696
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,559
But I admire it.

697
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,559
I admire the hell out of it. 

698
00:53:21,594 --> 00:53:23,476
How old are you 
going to be anyway?

699
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:25,643
I'm going to be 29. 

700
00:53:25,678 --> 00:53:27,845
Christ to a cracker! 

701
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,909
You speak Chinese? 
- I'm learning. 

702
00:53:32,522 --> 00:53:37,682
I speak a little Mandarin, pretty fluent Thai but 
that's the extent of my Asian language. 

703
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:46,829
How much do you make in the job? 

704
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:52,827
Well, it's a commission-based thing so, 
the more I sell the more I make.

705
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,171
Believe it or not, 
I understand how commission works.

706
00:53:55,206 --> 00:53:58,072
Now pipe down. 
Talk numbers. How much?

707
00:53:58,107 --> 00:54:02,782
I generally sell 5 beds a month, 
and I get 5% 

708
00:54:02,817 --> 00:54:04,337
Of the pre-tax sales. 

709
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:05,878
You make $700 every month? 

710
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,153
Yes. 
- That could work. 

711
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,916
You like Harriet? 
- Yes. 

712
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:15,374
She's had a tough go-over. You mess her up,
I'll kill your parents ... your parents still alive?

713
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:17,156
Yes. 
- Good. 

714
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,699
Let's go girls. C'mon up ...
Say goodnight to Brian.

715
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:25,076
Goodnight Brian. 

716
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,042
Dad, I think I'm gonna
walk with Brian.

717
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:38,704
Not this late at night you're not.
Get in the car. 

718
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:40,365
It's only 9:30. 

719
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,342
Suit yourself. 

720
00:54:41,377 --> 00:54:45,752
Take the avenues, no sidestreets. 
Here here, take this. 

721
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:46,873
What's this? 

722
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,507
It's a switchblade. 
Don't lose it, I got it in Corsica. 

723
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:52,394
Bye daddy. 

724
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:54,076
Goodnight darling. 

725
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:02,057
Hey Larry.

726
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:04,103
Whoa, what up ... 

727
00:55:04,712 --> 00:55:06,238
I was in the neighbourhood 

728
00:55:07,844 --> 00:55:09,828
This is Harriet ... 

729
00:55:09,863 --> 00:55:13,147
Oh ... 
Hi.

730
00:55:15,797 --> 00:55:16,931
How are ya? 

731
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,167
Larry.

732
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:22,745
Nice to meet you. 
- Nice to meet you.

733
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:28,166
So, what are you up to?

734
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:33,370
Oh, me, I'm just having some dinner 
drinking some vodka. 

735
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:35,232
You, uh, you want some? 

736
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,598
Is that purple vodka? 

737
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:41,027
Yeah, just put a little 
extra shit in there. 

738
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:45,083
I'll have some. 
- Yeah. Brian? 

739
00:55:45,118 --> 00:55:49,357
Uh ... sure, I guess.
- Alright. 

740
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:51,397
Let's do this.

741
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:58,209
You guys want a little bit 
of ethanol? 

742
00:55:58,244 --> 00:55:59,779
No.

743
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:05,350
There you go. One for you. 
One for you. 

744
00:56:05,385 --> 00:56:07,456
One for me. 

745
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:11,227
Hey, uh, 
can we go down to the pool?

746
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:17,954
Yeah, sure. 

747
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:23,230
Absolutely. 
Yeah you wanna use the wee lil' key here. 

748
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:27,607
Thanks. 
- No problem. Have a great time. 

749
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:30,298
Bye Larry. 
- Nice to meet ya. 

750
00:56:37,034 --> 00:56:39,514
So what are we doing here? 

751
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:41,580
We swim. 

752
00:56:47,226 --> 00:56:49,736
In the nude, I presume? 

753
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:52,103
Well, pretty much.

754
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:58,380
Let's go up here. 

755
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:06,754
Effectively combines
3 of my great fears.

756
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:12,760
The dark, heights,
public nudity. 

757
00:57:55,749 --> 00:57:57,489
What if I'm scared? 

758
00:57:58,394 --> 00:57:59,926
You're not. 

759
00:58:00,129 --> 00:58:02,635
Yes I am ...
How do you know?

760
00:58:02,826 --> 00:58:05,480
Well, I did it.

761
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:07,179
Good for you. 

762
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:09,219
Am I a virgin ... 

763
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:14,450
Being thrown into the snakepit? 
to honour the Kraken? 

764
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:17,436
I think we both know
that's not the case.

765
00:58:33,512 --> 00:58:35,384
Can we have sex over there? 

766
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:40,439
Do you want me to go ask 
the security guard?

767
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:54,406
Sweden have a quarter of the available light 
we have here in the US.

768
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:55,890
And?

769
00:58:55,925 --> 00:58:59,898
And what does less light mean?
- Shorter days.

770
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:02,192
Yes, but more importantly
longer nights.

771
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:05,109
These motherfuckers know how to 
get themselves some sleep.

772
00:59:05,144 --> 00:59:08,772
Me, I sleep like the dead anyway 
but I cannot touch the Swedes, I'll tell you that.

773
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:12,074
They outsleep everybody, but ... 

774
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:16,525
They are some depressed, 
suicidal niggers ... I'll tell you that for nothin'

775
00:59:17,365 --> 00:59:22,957
Where is that, Iceland? 
Anyway, be that as it may ... 

776
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,653
Can you hold on one second? 

777
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:29,470
Brian? 
- Yeah? 

778
00:59:29,477 --> 00:59:31,004
Kenyatta called. 

779
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:39,442
This is Kenyatta. 
- Hey, Kennyata, it's Brian Weathersby.

780
00:59:39,477 --> 00:59:40,655
Hey Brian. 

781
00:59:41,169 --> 00:59:42,496
What's up man? 

782
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:44,059
You called me. 

783
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:49,500
Mmm no ... you called me 
I'm calling you back. 

784
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:54,057
Shit! You're right! 
They approved you. 

785
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:55,774
So so, listen man ... 
This is how it breaks down.

786
00:59:57,284 --> 01:00:02,245
You are going to go to Hong Kong 
in a few months, and ... 

787
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,302
We have an international sister agency, 
they gonna handle it from there, hook you up, 

788
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:13,081
I just wanna say, congratu-fuckin-lations man, 
you did it. 

789
01:00:13,982 --> 01:00:16,799
Thanks. 
- So, uh I'll be in touch ... 

790
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:22,598
I'll probably have you come in and take care 
of some financial stuffs, but congratulations! 

791
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,421
Thank you. 
- You got it baby.

792
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:28,860
Laters. 
- Bye. 

793
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:42,311
As I suspected gents 
he didn't go for the black market idea.

794
01:00:42,346 --> 01:00:44,587
No go. I'll call it off. 

795
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:49,233
I appreciate the effort though. I owe you all 
for the due diligence. This round's on me. 

796
01:00:50,175 --> 01:00:55,749
Weathersby, how come you've never had a wife? 
Never a family. 

797
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:58,279
Just why, 
if you don't mind us asking. 

798
01:00:58,314 --> 01:01:00,612
Well, you guys 
are happily married, right? 

799
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:01,413
Yes.

800
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:04,787
Look where it got you, 
getting hand-pumped on a Tuesday night. 

801
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:07,701


802
01:01:07,736 --> 01:01:09,085


803
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,751


804
01:01:10,786 --> 01:01:14,390


805
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:17,506


806
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,943
Why have you 
never done it, John? 

807
01:01:19,978 --> 01:01:21,753
It's ok to not be married. 

808
01:01:21,788 --> 01:01:22,863
Yes, it is. 

809
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,291
I was close once. 
Hawaiian broad. 

810
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,838
What happened? 

811
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:35,084
We split, she married a college professor 
who brewed his own beer. 

812
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,319


813
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:39,199
What does it feel to study? 

814
01:01:39,234 --> 01:01:41,791
Asian studies. 

815
01:01:42,377 --> 01:01:45,740
Well, looks like 
it turned out well for everybody. 

816
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:49,308
Oh yeah, 
here I am with you fish-face perverts 

817
01:01:49,343 --> 01:01:51,609
Fuck you, 
round-eyed drouchebag.

818
01:01:51,644 --> 01:01:54,781
Douchebag, Nagata. 
D-O-U-C-H-E-B-A-G.

819
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:57,358
Goddamn, if you don't try 
to squeeze an R in every word. 

820
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:59,858
Asshole. 

821
01:02:00,947 --> 01:02:04,097
Honey, you may wanna work the balls a little bit 
We're gonna be here all night. 

822
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:06,097
You want some goat stew? 

823
01:02:06,132 --> 01:02:07,907
You made that? 

824
01:02:07,942 --> 01:02:09,739
Hell, no. 

825
01:02:09,803 --> 01:02:11,576
West Indian girl I know 
made it for me. 

826
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:15,533
It's damn good too. 
Real dark-skinned girl, ass like a beach ball.

827
01:02:22,433 --> 01:02:24,419
That's your girl?
- Yeah.

828
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:30,709
Mmm mm .. body's tight ... 
No disrespect. 

829
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:34,309
Hi 
- Hi. 

830
01:02:35,095 --> 01:02:38,953
You're Roger. 
- Good guess. It's nice to meet you Happy. 

831
01:02:39,643 --> 01:02:45,755
You fine-looking thing you. You want some goat stew?
- Sure. 

832
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:46,797
Be right back. 

833
01:02:52,817 --> 01:02:54,420
So what's the big news? 

834
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:59,566
Shall we get a cup of coffee
or somethin'?

835
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,419
I don't know ... depends on how serious 
this little meeting we're having is ...

836
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:05,997
Not serious. 

837
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:13,754
Here you go. 
One piping hot goat stew. 

838
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:20,218
Smells good. I'll leave you two 
lovebirds alone. Nice to meet you ... 

839
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:28,535
Or we can do it here. 

840
01:03:28,533 --> 01:03:31,089
You're making me nervous. 

841
01:03:31,124 --> 01:03:32,773
No, don't be. 
It's nothing really. 

842
01:03:41,306 --> 01:03:42,615
How's your soup? 

843
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,155
A little ...

844
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,759
Ligamenty ... 

845
01:03:50,812 --> 01:03:54,317
Well, you don't have to eat it if you uh ... 
- No, it's good.

846
01:03:55,506 --> 01:03:57,246
So what is it? 

847
01:03:58,391 --> 01:03:59,997
I got the baby. 

848
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:07,992
The baby, the baby?
- Yeah. 

849
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:13,241
I made the list. 
I'm going to China to get it 

850
01:04:13,276 --> 01:04:16,826
And bring it back here. 

851
01:04:20,947 --> 01:04:23,729
Wow ... that's so great.
- I know. 

852
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:31,859
Yeah, I know, it's crazy. 
On the one hand, I've been waiting 

853
01:04:32,871 --> 01:04:36,581
For a long time ... 
- Uh Brian, I really wanna hear this, can ya just 

854
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:41,303
Hold this for one sec cause I just ... 
is there a bathroom I could use really quickly? 

855
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:50,096
Yeah sure, it's right over there. 
- This is really great Brian, really excited for you.

856
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:39,651
I'm so sorry I just run over that 
all these things that I have to do. 

857
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:44,321
Like what? 
- Like, just stuffs for the show and some other things. 

858
01:05:44,517 --> 01:05:48,696
I could come with you, this place is ...
- No, cause I just remembered I have a doctor's appointment 

859
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:55,410
It's for my ... 
- Gynaecologist? You just remembered you had a gynaecologist to see 

860
01:05:55,445 --> 01:06:00,200
Yeah, so I have to go,
but I'll call you later and uhm 

861
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:02,946
Congratulations! 
I'm super-psyched for you. 

862
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:07,459
Thanks. My family's having a dinner 
to celebrate tomorrow night. 

863
01:06:07,494 --> 01:06:09,894
Can you come? 
- Sure.

864
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:13,846
You could bring your dad if you want. 
- Great. 

865
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:23,942



866
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,330



867
01:06:29,563 --> 01:06:33,862



868
01:06:33,634 --> 01:06:37,123
Mom? 
- Yeah, who's this?

869
01:06:37,555 --> 01:06:44,450
It's Harriet. 
- Harriet? How are you dear? 

870
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:49,239
I'm okay. 
- Oh God, good to hear your voice.

871
01:06:49,246 --> 01:06:54,467
Thanks. Uhm ... 
What are you up to?

872
01:06:54,502 --> 01:06:59,562
Oh, you gotta get out here and see me. 
It's been too long, dear. 

873
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:05,878
Yup, where are you, exactly? 
- This is the new place, the New Mexico house.

874
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:09,502
I thought it's Naples, Florida, 809? 

875
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:17,221
The uh,
the Florida house. 

876
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:27,814
When did you move out there?
- We come here for the polo season ... 

877
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:29,698
And Paul's car show. 

878
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:33,671
Is Paul the new boyfriend? 
- He is.

879
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:45,403
Great. What does he do? 
- Nothing, he likes cars and he owns a few ponies. 

880
01:07:47,419 --> 01:07:54,633
What are you up to?
- I'm relaxing, just here with some of my lady friends 

881
01:07:54,668 --> 01:08:03,744
And we're just doing what we do. 
Why don't you come here and I'll pay for everything. 

882
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:13,647
Uhm, maybe, yeah it's ... it's tough. 
I actually just called to ask you something.

883
01:08:13,682 --> 01:08:16,448
Well, I don't know 
what you could possibly ask me. 

884
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:19,421
Well sort of a general question, mom. 

885
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:24,182
Y'know I still get these alumni newsletters 
from Graaten 


886
01:08:24,427 --> 01:08:29,583
Do you want me to hold on to them, 
I could put them in an envelope for you or somethin'

887
01:08:29,618 --> 01:08:31,177
No, it's okay. 

888
01:08:33,872 --> 01:08:41,736
Anyways, can I just ask you this thing? 
- Alright, if you feel like you must. 

889
01:08:45,117 --> 01:08:48,828
I'm seeing this guy 
and he's about to ... 

890
01:08:51,258 --> 01:08:56,594
Anyways I was with him ... 
and I got really nervous and I ... 

891
01:08:58,285 --> 01:09:02,118
Went to the bathroom and I threw up everywhere.
- You're ill? 

892
01:09:02,564 --> 01:09:07,615
No, I'm not ... I'm not ill. 
I just went to the bathroom and threw up everywhere 

893
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:13,995
I just wondered if you had
ever done anything like that. 

894
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:23,739
Honey, you probably got a microbial virus or some type
of toxic food poisoning. Did you eat from a deli?

895
01:09:23,774 --> 01:09:30,557
No mom, I didn't eat from a deli.
- Sweetheart. Hang up, don't give the phone co. all of our money. 

896
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:39,873
You plan a trip, you come up and see me. 
I'll make you soup, and I'll put you in bed 

897
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:43,398
And read you a book. 
You need to get healthy. 

898
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:49,066
Down. Come down and see you. 
- Good.

899
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:55,198
Will you say hello to your father for me? 
And tell him I need to talk to him? - Ok.

900
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:59,567
Alright, beautiful. 
Bye.

901
01:10:04,006 --> 01:10:06,407
I haven't been in an office 
in 20 years. 

902
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:10,489
This is different? 
- Where are the offices? 

903
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:14,351
These are them. 
- Hmm ... these pens ... 

904
01:10:14,386 --> 01:10:20,648
... These aren't offices. Where do you
hang your topcoat, your diplomas, your artwork? 

905
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:26,036
So sorry to keep you guys waiting 
I'm Kenyatta ... 

906
01:10:26,071 --> 01:10:28,162
Kirby Weathersby.
- Nice to meet you. 

907
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:33,460
Your son has been very diligent about this 
and he's a rare case ... 

908
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:36,932
Oh yeah he's been talkin' bout it his whole life 
- Is that right? 

909
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,525
For his 8th birthday, 
I got him a bike. 

910
01:10:40,897 --> 01:10:47,577
Chrome mongoose. He ran to his room crying, 
said he wanted a baby, a Chinese baby for that matter. 

911
01:10:53,422 --> 01:10:57,988
Well, let's get down to some specifics, shall we?. 
Oh, can I get either of you somethin' to drink? 

912
01:10:58,023 --> 01:10:59,302
I'll take a bourbon. 

913
01:10:59,337 --> 01:11:01,727
Dad? They don't do that.
- No?

914
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:07,699
Oh, great. 
Nothing for me, thanks. 

915
01:11:09,797 --> 01:11:14,630
So, uhm, thanks for coming in. 
Obviously you'll be the baby's primary sponsor ...

916
01:11:14,665 --> 01:11:17,647
Brian ... and 
Mr. Weathersby...

917
01:11:17,682 --> 01:11:18,923
Kirby, please. 

918
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:27,979
Kirby, your wife and two boys, John and James, 
will be the baby's secondary guardians, is that right?

919
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:33,351
Ok, great. Just sign here and here Ok, 
and initial here.

920
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:35,358
Thanks. 
- Thank you.

921
01:11:36,378 --> 01:11:42,860
So Brian, looks like you'll be headed over to Hong Kong 
in 2 months, you'll spend 2 weeks there. 

922
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,413
And then you'll be returning here 
to New York with the baby. 

923
01:11:48,156 --> 01:11:49,659
This is terrific. 

924
01:11:49,994 --> 01:11:55,160
Brian, let's go celebrate. 
Kenny, would you care to join us? 

925
01:11:55,431 --> 01:11:58,774
Uh y'know I would love to 
but I've got work to do here 

926
01:11:59,044 --> 01:12:04,192
Here's what you do, tell your girl to hold all 
your calls and you pop out for a quick one with us.

927
01:12:04,227 --> 01:12:05,832
Well, I don't have a girl, Kirby. 

928
01:12:07,597 --> 01:12:10,533
Who makes your appointments? 
Who takes your drycleaning in? 

929
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:13,026
I do. 

930
01:12:13,061 --> 01:12:16,046
You do? 
Mercy, Lord, that's tragic. 

931
01:12:19,117 --> 01:12:20,235
Harriet.

932
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:26,434
Hey dad, this is Octavio, 
he was just gettin' going. 

933
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:31,212
Not on my account he won't.
- No, no, I've kept him long enough. 

934
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:34,930
Take care Octavio. 

935
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:43,170
Don't. 

936
01:12:48,786 --> 01:12:49,833
So.
- So?

937
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm going to cooking school. In France.
- Alright. 

938
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,202
I just signed up online. 

939
01:12:59,185 --> 01:13:03,499
Why not take on another career? 
Blazed through 5 in 5 years. 

940
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:05,980
Dad?
- You're on pace for some kinda record.

941
01:13:07,798 --> 01:13:13,683
Well, I'm sorry, but chef school ... but I've never 
seen you do anything but pour cereal. 

942
01:13:13,718 --> 01:13:15,818
Y'know what, 
I really need your support right now. 

943
01:13:15,853 --> 01:13:17,989
I'll give you whatever you need. 

944
01:13:19,488 --> 01:13:20,795
Ok, thank you. 

945
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,576
Sure this isn't 
coming from somewhere else? 

946
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:26,564
Like what? 

947
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,720
Like uh ... like your friend.
- What about him? 

948
01:13:34,192 --> 01:13:35,729
Did he hurt you? 

949
01:13:38,821 --> 01:13:40,344
No.

950
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:43,999
He told me he loved me. 
- He did? 

951
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:49,930
Yes ... sort of. 
And I sort of love him. 

952
01:13:50,724 --> 01:13:56,228
But now, I'm gonna y'know commit myself 
fully to this, ok? 

953
01:13:56,263 --> 01:14:01,614
Well, it's a swift change, 
but whatever you need I'll support you. 

954
01:14:03,336 --> 01:14:08,575
Some of the most important decisions we make in life 
are done in a matter of minutes, even seconds

955
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,341
It's your life. 
Do as you will. 

956
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:21,823
He's asleep? 
- Yup, knocked out cold.

957
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:30,212
Well, should we get out of here?

958
01:14:30,917 --> 01:14:33,784
Y' think she might show up for some dessert? 
- We already ate it.

959
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:38,715
Oh yeah,
that'd be the plates of cake huh? 

960
01:14:39,026 --> 01:14:43,040
I'm sure she got tied up 
with something important.

961
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:49,049
Just make sure she's alright.
Call her, drop by her place. 

962
01:14:51,295 --> 01:14:55,000
Well, get him home, 
I'm gonna figure this thing out. 

963
01:14:56,218 --> 01:15:01,007
Hey, congratulations big guy. 
I'm so happy for you, Brian.

964
01:15:01,808 --> 01:15:02,620
Thanks mom. 

965
01:15:04,622 --> 01:15:06,110
Go get her, sport. 
- Bye.

966
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:14,062
That's gonna end poorly? 
- Jonathan?

967
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:15,968
It's just the way I see it, mom. 

968
01:15:16,003 --> 01:15:21,867
Women, present company excluded, are liars, thieves,
and a categorical waste of time and resources.

969
01:15:21,902 --> 01:15:24,163
You're a fool. 
- Yeah, I've been called worse. 

970
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:26,261
Roland, 

971
01:15:30,062 --> 01:15:34,083
How bout dessert? 
- Let's go. I'll get the coats. 

972
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,337
... You're crazy ... 
Bye! 

973
01:16:04,138 --> 01:16:05,234
Hey. 
- Hi. 

974
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:11,789
How are you doing? 
- Umm, I'm a little cramped. 

975
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:14,928
I'm sorry about dinner.

976
01:16:16,703 --> 01:16:18,078
What happened? 

977
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:24,682
I was at work and we couldn't get 
any cell service when we were taping

978
01:16:24,717 --> 01:16:34,498
but then Melanie was kinda like in my ear the 
whole day and I left my phone in my purse and ... 

979
01:16:34,533 --> 01:16:37,369
Just kind of ... 

980
01:16:38,313 --> 01:16:40,024
Is that a lie? 

981
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,182
Kind of.
- Ok.

982
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:54,303
Do you wanna come upstairs?

983
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,840
How was your dinner?

984
01:17:59,694 --> 01:18:00,884
I'm sorry. 

985
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:06,161
This is definitely my fault. 

986
01:18:07,072 --> 01:18:09,826
I just have so much 
I wanna tell you. 

987
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:14,363
First, I wanna tell you that ... 

988
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:19,018
I care for you. 
I really do. 

989
01:18:22,973 --> 01:18:25,592
Never met anyone like you. 

990
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:30,899
Ok.

991
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,529
I'm just so fucked up.

992
01:18:37,523 --> 01:18:42,115
I don't have a real job ... 
never had a boyfriend ...

993
01:18:42,596 --> 01:18:44,452
Never really been in love.

994
01:18:46,657 --> 01:18:50,161
It's just a lot. 
It's too much. 

995
01:18:52,452 --> 01:18:55,607
You're about to have 
a fuckin' kid, Brian. 

996
01:18:59,252 --> 01:19:00,503
I know.

997
01:19:03,195 --> 01:19:05,286
I understand ... 

998
01:19:07,545 --> 01:19:10,354
It's disappointing, but ... 

999
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:14,543
I guess I had to know 
one way or the other. 

1000
01:19:16,075 --> 01:19:18,121
I feel like shit. 

1001
01:19:19,754 --> 01:19:21,606
I am shit. 

1002
01:19:22,313 --> 01:19:27,340
I'm gonna go to chef school. 
Next week, in France. 

1003
01:19:29,992 --> 01:19:37,315
What? I didn't know ...
- Neither did I, but I speak French, so ...

1004
01:19:40,522 --> 01:19:44,578
It's gonna be a fresh start ...
- Can I have a little more vodka?

1005
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:10,170
Well, I think our work here 
is done. 

1006
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:12,537
No Brian, don't go like that. 
- Sorry ... 

1007
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:14,975
At least be mad at me ... 
- Sorry, I've got too much to be worried bout right now 

1008
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,234
I'm going to go ... 
- Please just stay a little while? 

1009
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:19,769
Sorry, that would be 
a little fucking easy.

1010
01:20:25,008 --> 01:20:27,991
You're really enjoying your  
self-righteousness now, aren't you?

1011
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:44,507
I've an international power converter 
thing in my apartment if you need it. 

1012
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:50,683
I got it in France
when I was 18.

1013
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,625
You don't understand.

1014
01:23:16,543 --> 01:23:21,863
There's ... something going on 
for a long time. 

1015
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,188
Hello ... 

1016
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:01,731
Hello? 
- Uhh, we're on our way. 

1017
01:24:03,249 --> 01:24:08,373
Now when I get to the house, 
I press the button with your name on it?

1018
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:14,344
What I don't understand is, how is the button 
big enough to hold your name? 

1019
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:17,315
Name is next to the button, dad. 

1020
01:24:19,534 --> 01:24:23,298
Oh oh ok ... and the porter will clear it? 
- There's no doorman, dad. 

1021
01:24:23,879 --> 01:24:28,065
No porter? what d'ya mean, you mean no one? 
- No.

1022
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:35,180
Who does your shoes? Who take care of deliveries? 
- Dad, just ring the buzzer 'n I'll buzz you up. 

1023
01:24:35,215 --> 01:24:40,508
Ok? You'll figure it out when you get here?
- Ok ok ... alright, see you there. Bye ...

1024
01:24:41,848 --> 01:24:43,387
How do ya shut this off? 

1025
01:24:43,422 --> 01:24:47,016
Uhmm ... right there. 
- Hit the green, no, hit the red. 

1026
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:52,563
Thanks for the cellphone. 
He's living in squalor.

1027
01:25:15,008 --> 01:25:17,106
Hi. 
- Hi. 

1028
01:25:20,397 --> 01:25:22,594
I thought you'd already gone. 

1029
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:29,404
My plane is supposed to leave tomorrow, but I thought
I'd come by and get the power converter. 

1030
01:25:33,434 --> 01:25:35,207
What happened to your face? 

1031
01:25:35,945 --> 01:25:38,620
Uh ... a pickup game. 
- A pickup game? 

1032
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:40,551
Yeah, some fratboys. 

1033
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,525
Well, are you having a party? 

1034
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:49,467
My folks are coming by and 
my brothers are coming too. 

1035
01:25:50,513 --> 01:25:53,342
Oh, God ... 
is there someone here? 

1036
01:25:56,364 --> 01:25:58,508
Maybe I should leave.

1037
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:12,052
Oh!
- This is the little one. 

1038
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,954
I thought you had to go to China. 

1039
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:24,486
Uh, no, the agency called, this couple 
in Long Island flipped out and got cold feet. 

1040
01:26:26,322 --> 01:26:29,202
So, 
she's yours?

1041
01:26:30,881 --> 01:26:36,574
Went out there last week, and we're 
celebrating one week together today. 

1042
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:42,627
This is May. 
- Did you pick that? 

1043
01:26:42,662 --> 01:26:45,230
No, but I like it.

1044
01:26:45,265 --> 01:26:48,807
Me too. 
She's beautiful. 

1045
01:26:48,842 --> 01:26:50,572
Yeah, I think so too. 

1046
01:26:54,699 --> 01:26:56,766
Let me get that thing. 
- Oh.

1047
01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:08,467
Oh, the door? 
- Yeah, can you please buzz that? 

1048
01:27:15,247 --> 01:27:16,530
Stay there. 

1049
01:27:20,297 --> 01:27:21,830
Uh, think this is it. 

1050
01:27:23,891 --> 01:27:26,056
Should work in all of Europe. 

1051
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:29,085
Brian, I wanted to talk to you 
a little bit more. 

1052
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:33,339
Well, my entire family is bout to walk thru the door.
- I know, I just wanted to apologise 

1053
01:27:33,374 --> 01:27:37,252
For acting out the other night and I'm really sorry
for being so weird and I just wanna tell you that 

1054
01:27:37,287 --> 01:27:40,631
Alright, let's have a little look 
at the little Samurai. 

1055
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:45,329
Samurai's Japanese, dad. 
- Akibonos, the little panda, where's she? 

1056
01:27:45,867 --> 01:27:48,420
Oh my God!

1057
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:54,721
She is the most darling thing I've ever seen. 
Can I hold her? 

1058
01:27:54,756 --> 01:27:59,856
Oh thank you. Barbara, we gotta apply 
and get one of these. 

1059
01:27:59,482 --> 01:28:00,579
You did it! 
So damn proud of ya! 

1060
01:28:05,009 --> 01:28:08,202
This is not just champagne. 
- Hey, everyone ...

1061
01:28:10,863 --> 01:28:12,749
This is ... 
this is Happy. 

1062
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:18,519
Oh I thought you were goin' off to become a chef, Happy.
- Yeah, well, I uhmm ...

1063
01:28:19,246 --> 01:28:23,916
I signed up for a cooking school 
on the internet ... 

1064
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:30,780
It doesn't exist because it dissolved in 2004 
and they didn't update the website ...

1065
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:35,137
I see ...
- But I'm gonna study here in the city ... 

1066
01:28:35,172 --> 01:28:40,985
Marvelous! That's fantastic, because we need 
someone in this family who can cook. 

1067
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:48,155
Because frankly, Barbara don't get ya nose outta the joint,
collectively we can't make buttered toast. 

1068
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:50,663
John Weathersby.

1069
01:28:51,138 --> 01:28:53,636
Nice to meet you. 
- Get outta here. 

1070
01:28:54,012 --> 01:28:55,346
A toast, Brian? 

1071
01:28:56,927 --> 01:29:02,016
Why don't you do it Grandpa? You're good at it. 
- Mm, good ... I'll take that bait. 

1072
01:29:02,051 --> 01:29:04,696
I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Happy. 

1073
01:29:07,174 --> 01:29:10,109
Since brevity is the soul of wit 

1074
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:14,629
And tediousness its limbs 
and outward flourishes

1075
01:29:14,664 --> 01:29:17,487
Therefore, I shall be brief. 

1076
01:29:17,522 --> 01:29:20,225
Twait. 
- That's William Shakespeare, boy. 

1077
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:27,813
May ... 
a new child, a new life, a new family ...

1078
01:29:28,453 --> 01:29:35,276
Welcome, little May ... 
and love ... love love love

1079
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:42,733
You're in good kind hands.
And here's to many many happy birthdays to come

1080
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:44,868
And I'll be at every one of them! Salud!
- Salud!

1081
01:29:51,745 --> 01:29:56,236
Brian, have you got any beer in the fridge? 
- No. 

1082
01:29:57,514 --> 01:30:02,934
Happy darling, would you like to come and ... 
to a deli and see if we can pick up some beer? 

1083
01:30:04,006 --> 01:30:08,970
There's a deli ... two blocks that way 
oh it's in here, the elevator ... 

1084
01:30:09,992 --> 01:30:12,053
Happy, I don't drink beer.

1085
01:30:25,976 --> 01:30:28,838
It's okay dear. 
- I'm sorry.

1086
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:30,767
Don't be sorry. 

1087
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:40,688
I really wanted to come to the dinner.
- It's okay.

1088
01:30:42,706 --> 01:30:46,694
I called my mother the other day.
She ...

1089
01:30:47,376 --> 01:30:49,857
She didn't know 
who I was at first. 

1090
01:30:52,103 --> 01:30:58,327
She doesn't call me on my birthday 
I'm sorry. 

1091
01:30:58,362 --> 01:31:00,006
When is your birthday? 

1092
01:31:01,142 --> 01:31:02,632
Uh ...
June 9th.

1093
01:31:06,807 --> 01:31:11,186
I was half a geezer, 
when I had that boy. 

1094
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,706
He's been sweet 
his whole life. 

1095
01:31:15,545 --> 01:31:18,284
But he never had the family 
the other kids did. 

1096
01:31:19,495 --> 01:31:22,352
Everyone thought that we were 
his grandparents. 

1097
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:31,319
He told his teacher once his real parents'd died in
a car crash and his grandparents took him on.

1098
01:31:31,354 --> 01:31:32,870
He did? 

1099
01:31:35,175 --> 01:31:39,783
Well, he was confused I guess. 
I don't blame him. 

1100
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:49,235
It wasn't disloyal, he was just trying to make 
everything seem normal, I suppose. 

1101
01:31:50,847 --> 01:31:53,054
But nothing's normal. 

1102
01:31:54,827 --> 01:31:56,738
You guys seem pretty normal. 

1103
01:31:57,526 --> 01:32:02,392
We're not. 
You have a right to be worried I'm afraid. 

1104
01:32:02,427 --> 01:32:06,392
I'm just afraid that I fucked 
everything up beyond repair. 

1105
01:32:06,427 --> 01:32:11,786
Nothing's fucked up. 
Nothing's beyond repair. 

1106
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:16,870
Thank you. 

1107
01:32:19,138 --> 01:32:22,963
You're welcome. 
Shall we go back? 

1108
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:27,317
This could use a wall light 
or some kinda industrial screw. 

1109
01:32:27,352 --> 01:32:31,425
The pipe looks strong enough, the rope looks 
strong enough, leave the damn thing alone. 

1110
01:32:32,303 --> 01:32:34,411
Welcome back girls. 
Have a seat. 

1111
01:32:36,037 --> 01:32:38,168
Now, Happy ... 

1112
01:32:38,203 --> 01:32:40,858
For your benefit, 
I want you to know that 

1113
01:32:41,538 --> 01:32:48,699
For the kids when they were born I would 
make a piata of a famous dictator,

1114
01:32:48,734 --> 01:32:50,119
Fill it with bitter honey. 

1115
01:32:51,354 --> 01:32:53,298
John, uh, had Stalin. 

1116
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:55,343
James had Mussolini, 

1117
01:32:56,035 --> 01:33:00,760
And Brian, had Pol Pot. 
You see the progression? 

1118
01:33:01,495 --> 01:33:06,264
And this is
Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi.

1119
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:15,024
Let's whack him. Now Happy, since May 
can't exercise her own honour, I'm sure

1120
01:33:15,059 --> 01:33:18,357
She would want you to be the proxy whacker. Ok? 
- Ok. 

1121
01:33:20,084 --> 01:33:22,149
Blindfold her please.
- Yes sir.

1122
01:33:29,878 --> 01:33:35,085
Uhm Happy, you won't be able to break it
with the first burst. You're only going to ... 

1123
01:33:36,256 --> 01:33:39,524
Put a start on it because of its 
superior workmanship. 

1124
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,029
Over here. 

1125
01:33:50,525 --> 01:33:51,595
Attagirl. Straight. 

1126
01:34:06,201 --> 01:34:09,923
Here here, gimme that baby. 
C'mon c'mon ... 

1127
01:34:11,822 --> 01:34:19,047
Brian, there's a deuce loose in the caboose 
and I'm not well-versed in that detail. 

1128
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:34,966
Champagne, cocktails, drinks ... c'mon everyone 
we must drink up, today is one big fuckin' day ...
