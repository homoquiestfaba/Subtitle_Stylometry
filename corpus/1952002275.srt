2
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,490
So, what do you do?

3
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,880
I’m studying to be an actress.

4
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,930
You?

5
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,910
I’m a longshoreman.

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,650
No, I mean really.

7
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,710
I mean...
I mean really too.

8
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,880
Although, starting next Monday, I’m
doing something a little more glamorous.

9
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,990
What's that?

10
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,470
Night cashier at a cafeteria.

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,300
I don’t mean how you make money.

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,590
I mean,

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,930
what are you interested in?

14
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,810
Honey - if I had the answer to that one,

15
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,230
I bet I’d bore us both to death
in half an hour.

16
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,380
Thank God, that’s over...

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,760
xxx

18
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,550
...And she was very disappointing.

19
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,430
Oh, Frank!

20
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,200
Oh, very nice Frank!

21
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,910
Oh, thanks so much, Mrs. Givings.

22
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,180
I can’t tell you how much we enjoyed it.

23
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,550
You have a very talented wife.

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,550
I’ll pass it along!

25
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,080
Frank!

26
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,260
Hi!

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,710
She’s in there...!

28
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,310
I'm about ready
for that drink?

29
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,250
Couple of minutes!

30
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,820
April...?

31
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,520
Sweetheart...?

32
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,180
- You about ready to leave?
- Yeah, yeah.

34
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,930
I’ve just got to get this makeup off.

35
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,610
Well... I guess  it wasn’t

36
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,190
a triumph or anything, was it?

37
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,090
I guess not.

38
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,110
I’ll be ready in a minute.

39
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,080
Take your time.

40
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,140
Listen, will you do me a favor?

41
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,270
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,030
Will you say we can’t?

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,090
Say it’s because of the baby sitter
or something?

44
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,330
Well, the thing is, I already
said that we could. I mean...

45
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,970
I just saw them and I said we would.

46
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,200
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?

47
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,280
That should be
simple enough.

48
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,200
Don’t you think that’s a little bit
rude, April?

49
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,330
Well I’ll tell them myself.

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,080
Okay.

51
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,050
Okay.
Take it easy.

52
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,460
All right?

53
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,230
I’ll tell them.

54
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,230
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.

55
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,780
Thank you.

56
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,300
We should’ve let you get mixed up
in the damned thing. It's all.

57
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,850
All right.

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,130
A bunch of amateurs.

59
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,290
I mean, you’ve studied for Christ’s sake.

60
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,760
Could we stop talking
about it now?

61
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,130
- Sure.

62
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,240
I just don’t want you feeling
bad about it, that’s all,

63
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,460
because it’s not worth it, you know?

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,180
It’s bad enough having to live out here
among these damn people -

65
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,410
- What’d you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.

66
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,050
Could you just stop talking about it now,

67
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,840
before you drive me crazy, please?

68
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,900
What are you doing?

69
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,300
April...

70
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,520
Sweetheart...

71
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,980
Let's talk about this, okay?

72
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,560
Please, don't do that.

73
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,615
Come on now.

74
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:24,670
Don’t touch me.

75
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,440
April... April...

76
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,850
You just... LEAVE ME ALONE!

77
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,010
Okay.

78
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,340
Okay.

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,170
It strikes me, that there’s a
considerable amount of bullshit...

80
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,420
going on here, and there is just
a few things, that I’d like to clear up.

81
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,130
All right?

82
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,310
Number one:

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,230
It’s not my fault the play was lousy.

84
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,840
Okay?

85
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,740
Number two:

86
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,320
It’s sure as hell not my fault

87
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,600
that you didn’t turn out
to be an actress,

88
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,030
and the sooner you get over that
little piece of soap opera

89
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,260
the better off we’ll both be.

90
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,370
Number three:

91
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,120
I don’t happen to fit the role of dumb,
insensitive suburban husband,

92
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,350
you’ve been trying to leave that
crap on me ever since we moved out here.

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,680
and I'm damn before wear.

94
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,640
Number four:

95
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,090
April...

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,120
April!

97
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
April...

98
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,720
What the hell are you doing?
Get back to the car.

99
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,300
No.
I will xxx

100
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,500
Just let me stand here for a second.

101
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,050
Goddamnit.

102
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
April...

103
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,190
Can you please, just get back
in the car, and talk about this,

104
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,880
instead of running all over Route 12?

105
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,450
Haven’t I made it clear I don’t
particularly want to talk about it?

106
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,550
Okay. I mean, Jesus, I’m trying to be
nice about this thing. For God's sake.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,830
How kind of you.

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,660
How terribly, terribly kind of you.

109
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,330
Wait a minute.
I don’t deserve this.

110
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,400
You’re always so wonderfully definite,
on the subject of...

111
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,030
- what you do and don’t deserve?
- Wait a minute!

112
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,690
Wait a goddamn...

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,460
April, now you listen to me.

114
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,600
This is one time

115
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,740
you're not gonna get away with twisting
everything that I say, April.

116
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,950
This just happen to be
one goddamn time.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,590
I know I'm not the wrong here.

118
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,860
Christ, I wish you’d
stayed home tonight!

119
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,630
You know what you are,
whe you are like this, April?

120
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
You’re sick.

121
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,830
I really mean that.
You’re sick!

122
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,270
And you know
what you are?

123
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,690
What?

124
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,170
- You’re disgusting.
- Oh yeah?

125
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,440
You don't bully me, Frank.

126
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,690
Just because you’ve got me
safely in this little trap,

127
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,390
you think you can bully me
into feeling whatever you want!

128
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,370
- In a trap! You in  a trap!
- Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,200
- Jesus!
- Me, Frank. Me!

130
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,840
Don't make me laugh.

131
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,430
Pathetic so xxx little boy.

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,440
Look at you!

133
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,790
Look at you and tell me,

134
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,130
how by any stretch of the imagination

135
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,280
you can call yourself a man!

136
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,830
What?

137
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,430
Damn!

138
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Oh, Jesus Christ!

139
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,660
Don’t look at me like that, April.

140
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,110
Could we please go home now?

141
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,570
Daily News.

142
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,560
Daily News.
Yes, thanks, sir.

143
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,000
Daily News.
Thank you.

144
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
Fifteenth floor.

145
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,080
I’m going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.

146
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,330
For the next few hours, you’re to
warn me of Bandy’s every approach

147
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,730
and you may need to shield me
from public view in the likely event

148
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,920
that avoid my stomach.

149
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,070
It’s that bad.

150
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,800
Morning, Jack.

151
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,870
Nothing good about it,
I assure you.

152
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,330
Of course, I knew the moment you stepped
off the train what you were looking for...

153
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,740
A small remodeled barn,
or a carriage house.

154
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,280
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you

155
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,340
that sort of thing just isn’t
available anymore...

156
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,990
But I don’t want you to despair.

157
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,380
There is one place up here
I wanna show you...

158
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,590
Now of course it isn’t very
desirable at this end.

159
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,470
As you see,
Crawford Road is mostly these little

160
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,030
cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places.

161
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,470
Plumbers, carpenters,
little local people of that sort.

162
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,370
But eventually...

163
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,880
Eventually it leads up
to Revolutionary Road,

164
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,960
which is much nicer.

165
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,580
Now, the place I want to show you,
is a sweet little house

166
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,470
and a sweet little setting.

167
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,430
Simple, clean lines,

168
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,270
good lawns, marvelous for children.

169
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,290
It’s just around this next curve...

170
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,660
Now, you’ll see it.

171
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,110
There.

172
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,990
See the little white one?

173
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,740
Sweet, isn’t it?

174
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,700
The perky way it sits
there on its little slope?

175
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,400
Charming, isn’t it?

176
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,070
Oh, yes.

177
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,540
You wanted to see me?

178
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,920
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.

179
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,080
- Sorry. I thought I’d taken care...
- I’m not prepared to have this...

180
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,520
this conversation again, Frank.
You understand?

181
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,230
- I was literaly just getttin...
- These folks in the provinces look up to us.

182
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,150
We need to be efficient. We can’t have
this kind of back and forth, and so forth.

183
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
It’s just not efficient.

184
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,950
Am I Right?

185
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,970
Yes.

186
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,360
What was that about?

187
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,820
Toledo.

188
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,350
Branch manager wants a revised brochure
for the conference on “The Knox 500.”

189
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,330
“It’s just not efficient.”
Am I right? Am I right? Am I right?

190
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,590
Sounds like a goodie.

191
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,940
For God's sake. I don’t even know
what the Knox 500 does... Do you?

192
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,810
Don’t insult me.

193
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,420
if you’ll look in the inactive file
under SP-1109.

194
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,200
you’ll find copies of all the stuff
we sent to the agency..

195
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,470
and that way we can trace
the thing back to its...

196
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,970
To its original sources.

197
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,440
I hope you weren’t planning
on an early lunch.

198
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,630
No.

199
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,540
I’m not really hungry.

200
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,750
Good. I’ll check on you later.
All right?

201
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,660
Okay.

202
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,930
Okay.

203
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,400
You know something, Maureen?

204
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,890
You’re lucky you met me.

205
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,820
Oh? How's that?

206
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,820
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.

207
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,020
There’s certain art to survival at Knox.

208
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,700
Really.

209
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,500
Let me show you what I mean.

210
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,050
Waiter.

211
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,420
Bring me the telephone would you?
And two more martinis.

212
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,250
Clondike 55566, please.

213
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,540
Hello Mrs. Jorgensen.

214
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,680
Frank Wheeler here.

215
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,270
Yes. I just wanted to let you know,

216
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,360
that I’ve had to send Maureen Grube

217
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,680
down to Visual Aides for me.

218
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,340
I’ll probably need her the
rest of the afternoon.

219
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,740
Yes.

220
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,450
You too.

221
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,520
Take care now.

222
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,750
I've never even heard of Visual Aides.

223
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,890
That’s because...

224
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,830
It doesn’t exist.

225
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,860
Hi, Helen.

226
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,010
Come on in.

227
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,810
Oh, I can’t stay a minute...

228
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,800
I just wanted to bring
this sedum plantings

229
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,620
for that messy patch
down by the front yard.

230
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,830
It's like the europian house league

231
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,740
Only these have the most marvelous
little yellow blossoms.

232
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,250
Now all it wants for the first few day
is just a tiny dollop of water

233
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,580
and you’ll find it absolutely thrives.

234
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,290
Oh. Thank you, Helen.
It's so kind of you.

235
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,420
Would you like some coffee?

236
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,540
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?

237
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,590
Oh... I almost forgot.

238
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,280
There's a small favor I’d like to ask...

239
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,430
It's about...

240
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,100
It's about my son, John.

241
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,070
He’s been in the hospital.

242
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is everything all right?

243
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,760
Well, actualy...

244
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,960
It's just for the time being.
He's in... Pleasent Brook.

245
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,000
Psychiatric.

246
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,290
Oh.

247
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,430
Oh, I see.

248
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,730
Oh... Nothing serious.

249
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,330
He's just got a little run down.

250
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,400
Things can just get the better of us
sometimes.

251
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,860
Don't you agree?

252
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,060
Yes.

253
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,870
Of course.

254
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,810
It's a marvellous facility.

255
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,760
And the treatments seem to be doing
wonders for him...

256
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,460
Anyway,
they said getting out for an afternoon

257
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,810
might do him a little bit good.

258
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,640
I think he finds my friends a
little conventional, quite frankly

259
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,480
I mean, he’s travelled.

260
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,280
He has a PhD in mathematics.

261
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,860
I suppose you could say
he’s an intellectual.

262
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,440
It would do him a world of good to
meet a young couple like you.

263
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,520
We'd love to meet him.

264
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,330
Really?

265
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,050
Yes.

266
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,740
We'd love to.

267
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,260
Thank you, dear.

268
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,110
Thank you.

269
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,490
Well...

270
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,240
I must be off.

271
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,260
I remember the first day
you came off the train.

272
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,260
You weren’t like my other clients.

273
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,190
You were different.

274
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,990
You just seemed...

275
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,230
Special...

276
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,850
Of course you still are.

277
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,670
Remember...

278
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,200
Just the dollop xxx xxx

279
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,350
Bye.

280
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,710
I think you got me a little drunk.

281
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,040
You know what today is?

282
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,080
...Monday?

283
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,030
It’s my birthday.

284
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,480
I’m thirty years old today.

285
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,580
Happy birthday!

286
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,170
Thank you.

287
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,360
What was the name of that, um...

288
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,740
department you made up again?

289
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,710
Visual...

290
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,150
Visual Aides.

291
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,340
...What-a-joke.

292
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,270
What-a-joke.

293
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,500
Oh my...

294
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,590
Do you wanna hear a real joke...?

295
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,860
Yes.

296
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,660
My old man worked at Knox.

297
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,280
Yeah?

298
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,190
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

299
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,770
Oh.

300
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,850
Once a year,

301
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,510
he used to take me to the city for lunch.

302
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,360
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.

303
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,630
Nice.

304
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,850
No.

305
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,410
Not really.

306
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,910
I used to sit there and think.

307
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,530
"I hope to Christ
I don’t end up like you."

308
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,690
Now here I am,

309
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,280
a thirty year old Knox man.

310
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,160
Can you beat that?

311
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,550
I think I kind of lost you...

312
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,570
Your father worked for Knox...?

313
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,630
I'm sorry.
Everything’s kinda...

314
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,420
...going out of focus

315
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,040
Why don't we get some air?

316
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,780
You with me?

317
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,170
Is this you?

318
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,400
Yeah.

319
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,940
You've been to Paris?

320
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,500
I’ve never really been anywhere.

321
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,150
Maybe I’ll take you with me then.

322
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,260
I’m going back first chance I get.

323
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,420
I tell you.

324
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,240
People are alive there.

325
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,950
I like here.

326
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,400
All I know April is...

327
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,770
I wanna feel things.

328
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,820
Really feel them.

329
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,050
You know?

330
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,340
How’s that for an ambition...?

331
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,550
Frank Wheeler?

332
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,870
I think you’re the most
interesting person

333
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,660
I’ve ever met.

334
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,020
Guess this wasn’t what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?

335
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,260
No. It's really wasn't.

336
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,750
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

337
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,580
Yeah, sure.

338
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,150
There you go.

339
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,730
Can I get you a drink or anything?

340
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,630
No thanks, Maureen.
Actually it's...

341
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
It’s getting kind of late.
I guess I...

342
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,100
I guess I’d better be cutting out.

343
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,620
Oh. Gee.

344
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,210
That's right.

345
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,020
Did you miss your train?

346
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,240
That’s all right.

347
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,400
I’ll catch the next one.

348
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,500
Listen,

349
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,660
you were swell.

350
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,160
Take care now.

351
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,520
Frank...

352
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,830
Why are you all dressed up?

353
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,300
First of all,

354
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,530
I missed you all day

355
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,550
and I wanna say I’m sorry.

356
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,870
I’m sorry for the way
I’ve been since that stupid play.

357
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,990
I’m sorry for everything.

358
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,130
And I love you.

359
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,390
For the rest of life. xxx

360
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,310
Now, you...

361
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,780
Just wait here till I call you. Okay?

362
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,050
Okay.

363
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,350
Alright Frank!

364
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
You can come in now!

365
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,670
"Happy Birthday to you."

366
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,910
"Happy Birthday to you."

367
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,260
"Happy Birthday dear Daddy."

368
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,740
"Happy Birthday to you."

369
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,050
Happy Birthday, Darling.

370
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,750
I love you, daddy.

371
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,300
I love you too.

372
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,340
Frank.

373
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,350
Frank.

374
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,000
I have had the most wonderful idea.

375
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,880
I’ve been thinking about it all day.

376
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,840
Baby, what’s all this about?

377
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,970
You know how much money
we have saved...?

378
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,290
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.

379
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,490
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.

380
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,400
What we get for the house...

381
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,120
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?

382
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,530
Where are we going to live?

383
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,890
Paris.

384
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,710
What?

385
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,450
You always said
it was the only place

386
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,230
you’d ever been,
that you wanna to go back to.

387
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,610
The only place that was worth living.

388
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,340
So why don’t we go there?

389
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,870
You’re serious?

390
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,310
Yes.

391
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
What’s stopping us?

392
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,460
What’s stopping us?

393
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,750
Well, I can think of a number
of different things.

394
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,210
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?

395
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,420
You won’t be getting any kind of job,

396
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,280
because I will.

397
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,030
Oh, right.
Right.

398
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,410
Don’t laugh at me.

399
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,580
Listen to me.

400
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,100
Do you know what they pay

401
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,070
for secretarial positions in the
government agencies in Europe?

402
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,760
No. I don't.

403
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,670
Listen Frank, I’m serious about this.

404
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,250
- Do you think I’m kidding or something?
- Okay.

405
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,270
I just have a couple of questions,
is all.

406
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,150
For one thing,
what exactly am I supposed to be doing

407
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,450
while you’re out earning all this money?

408
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,280
Don’t you see,

409
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,410
that’s the whole idea?

410
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,250
You’ll be doing what you should’ve been
allowed to do seven years ago.

411
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,800
You’ll have time.

412
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,420
For the first time in your life
you’ll have time to find out

413
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,770
what it is that you actually want to do,

414
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,230
and when you figure it out,

415
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,370
you’ll have the time and the freedom...

416
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,370
to start doing it.

417
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,180
Sweetheart,

418
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,040
it’s just not very realistic, is all.

419
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,030
No, Frank.

420
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,180
This is what's unrealistic.

421
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,210
It’s unrealistic for a man with
a fine mind to go on working

422
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,890
year after year at a job he can’t stand,

423
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,890
coming home to a place he can’t stand,

424
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,570
to a wife who’s equally unable
to stand the same things.

425
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,320
You want to know the worst part?

426
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,810
Our whole existence here is based
on this great premise,

427
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,770
that we’re... special...

428
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,020
and superior to the whole thing.

429
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,230
But we're not.

430
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,790
We’re just like everyone else.

431
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,790
Look at us! We’ve bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.

432
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,020
This idea that you have to
resign from life

433
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,990
and settle down
the moment you have children.

434
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,010
And we’ve been punishing
each other for it.

435
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,270
Listen,

436
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,090
we decided to move out here.

437
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,110
No one ever forced me to
take the job at Knox.

438
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,990
I mean who ever said I was supposed
to be a big deal, anyway?

439
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,800
When I first met you...

440
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,290
there was nothing in the world
you couldn’t do or be.

441
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,100
When you first met me, I was a little
wise guy with a big mouth.

442
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,870
- That's all.
- You were not.

443
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,170
How can you even say that?

444
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,870
Okay.

445
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,370
Okay, so...

446
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,580
I'll have time.

447
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,780
And God knows that’s appealing.
It's...

448
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,400
It’s very appealing.

449
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,640
Everything you say make sense if...

450
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,840
If I had definite talent.
If I were a writer or an artist...

451
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,770
Listen.

452
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,550
Listen to me.

453
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,390
It’s what you are that’s being stifled.

454
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,640
It’s what you are that’s
being denied and denied,

455
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,600
in this kind of life.

456
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,540
And what’s that?

457
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,880
Don’t you know...?

458
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,080
You’re the most beautiful

459
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,900
and wonderful thing in the world...

460
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,650
You’re a man.

461
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,330
This is our chance, Frank

462
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,870
This is our one chance.

463
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,130
Okay.

464
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,230
Okay?

465
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,090
Why not?

466
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,520
Why the hell not?

467
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,740
All right.

468
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,960
All right. All right.

469
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,280
We're going to be fine.

470
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,160
Morning all.

471
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,210
Morning, Frank.

472
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,440
Ah, Franklin.
Good to see your shining face.

473
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,290
What's the news.

474
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,900
Fellas...

475
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,190
I’m moving to Paris.

476
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,320
Indeed.
And I’m moving to Tangiers.

477
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,040
xxx

478
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,740
xxx

479
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,890
xxx

480
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,490
xxx

481
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,450
...Intra-company letter to Toledo...

482
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,000
Attention...

483
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,600
B.F. Chalmers, branch manager...

484
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,910
With regard to recent and
repeated correspondence,

485
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,840
this is to advise that the matter
has been...

486
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,180
very satisfactorily taken in hand,
period, paragraph.

487
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,640
We wholly agree that the existing
brochure is unsuitable.

488
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,950
To this end we have developed thought...

489
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,080
"Speaking of Production Control..."

490
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,160
Here you are Mrs. Wheeler:

491
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,090
Here’s the travellers checks
you requested...

492
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,040
and your steamer reservations...

493
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,180
and these I’ll pass on
to the embassy for you.

494
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,630
Good luck.

495
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,170
Thank you.

496
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,670
September.
October at the outside.

497
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,200
I just happen to think people are
better off doing some kind of work

498
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,840
they actually like.

499
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,990
Right, right, yes.

500
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,210
I mean, assuming there is
a true vocation waiting for you.

501
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,990
Wouldn’t you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?

502
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,100
I don’t thinkit’s possible
to discover anything

503
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,280
on the fifteenth floor
of the Knox building,

504
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,140
and I don’t think any of you do either.

505
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,270
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy...

506
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,290
Daddy?

507
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,030
Michael...

508
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
Daddy, will you read it?

509
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,370
Yes.

510
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:44,520
...All the way to... here.

511
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,610
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.

512
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,360
But I won’t know anybody there.

513
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,930
Oh, I know.

514
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,840
I know. Neither will I.

515
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,120
But remember how you fell
when you started school?

516
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,780
And now look how many
friends you have...

517
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,430
You’ll never guess
what they eat in Paris.

518
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,460
You'll never
guess...

519
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,200
- What?
- What?

520
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,020
Slimy Snails.

521
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,880
Snails?!

522
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,470
Slimy snails and eaten frog’s legs!

523
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,270
Milly?

524
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,090
Where are you, doll?

525
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,720
Oh, you'd better get changed,
they’ll be here soon.

526
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,310
That what you're wearing?

527
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,220
Don't you like it?

528
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,760
Yeah.

529
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,510
You look great, doll.

530
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,490
Guess I better haul ass.

531
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,590
<i>Hey kids.
What time it is?</i>

532
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,140
Hiya gang.

533
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,340
<i>It's two thousands, two hundred...</i>

534
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,430
What you're watching?

535
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,840
<i>Starring Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob.</i>

536
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,800
Shep?

537
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,340
I was calling and calling you...

538
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,050
Hi.

539
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,500
Here we go.

540
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,210
Some little something.

541
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,010
Oh those look great.
I’m starving!

542
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,430
April...

543
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,240
I can't get over it -

544
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,750
you look like the cat
that ate the canary!

545
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,910
Do you have something to tell us?

546
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Just a little bit of news?

547
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,180
Well, actualy Milly, we...

548
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,290
We do have some important news. Yes.

549
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,890
I knew it.

550
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,940
Honey, why don't you tell them?

551
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,330
We’re going to Europe.

552
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,230
To Paris.

553
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,780
To live.

554
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,990
What?

555
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,230
When?

556
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,590
In september.

557
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,460
But what for?

558
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,340
What for?
Well...

559
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,140
Well, because...

560
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,100
Because we’ve always wanted to.
Because the kids are young enough.

561
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,810
Because it’s beautiful.
I mean really.

562
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,500
I mean, Shep, you've been there.
You tell her.

563
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,150
Yeah.
It's great city.

564
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,710
Yeah.

565
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,860
When did you make this decision?

566
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,920
About a week ago...
its hard to remember.

567
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,030
We just suddenly decided to go,
that’s all.

568
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,140
About a week ago,
and you tell us now!

569
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,210
Yeah. We had to get used to the idea.

570
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,370
So, what’s the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?

571
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,480
No, no.

572
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,030
Not exactly.

573
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,140
What do you mean, "not exactly?"

574
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,530
Frank won’t be getting
any kind of a job,

575
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,350
because I will.

576
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,230
So what are you gonna do, Frank?

577
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,180
I’m gonna study, you know...

578
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,070
I'm gonna read...

579
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,930
I suppose I’m gonna...

580
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,480
finally figure out what I wanna do
with my life, Shep.

581
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,940
...While she supports you?

582
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,790
Yes.

583
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,910
While she supports me...

584
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,960
In the beginning.

585
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,800
You wouldn’t believe what they pay
for secretarial work

586
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,870
in those government agencies over there.

587
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,460
NATO and E.C.A. and those places.

588
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,420
The cost of living is dirt cheap, right?

589
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,990
So cheap.

590
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,930
The truth is we just need
something different.

591
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,870
We’re not getting any younger and
we don’t want life to just pass us by.

592
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,360
That's right.

593
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,160
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

594
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,220
I mean it.

595
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,150
It really sounds wonderful.

596
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,530
Thank you, Milly.
Thank you.

597
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,830
We’ll certainly miss you, though -
won’t we, sweetie?

598
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,930
- Golly.
- Sure.

599
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,850
We'll miss you too.

600
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,770
- Of course.
- Sure.

601
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,210
We should have a toast or something.
???

602
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,210
To Paris.

603
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,940
To Paris.

604
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,680
To Paris.

605
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,100
To Paris.

606
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,250
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

607
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,440
You know what I think?

608
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,430
What?

609
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,810
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.

610
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,900
Oh God, I’m so relieved.

611
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,840
Me too...

612
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,610
I was thinking that the whole time.

613
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,445
I mean, what kind of man
is gonna sit around

614
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:22,280
in his bathrobe all day,
picking his nose

615
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,750
- while his wife goes out in works?
- I don't know, Shep.

616
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,740
I just don't know.

617
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,040
Why're you crying?

618
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,970
What's the matter?

619
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,820
It's nothing.

620
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,410
I'm just so relieved.

621
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,760
Shep.

622
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,480
Don't cry.
Please.

623
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,800
It’s all right.

624
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,200
Everything's gonna be all right.

625
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,750
Okay.

626
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,900
Oh my god, their faces!

627
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,440
Oh God!

628
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,650
Oh God!

629
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,210
You know what this is like, April?
Honestly.

630
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,350
Just talking like this?

631
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,230
The whole idea of going off to Europe
this way?

632
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,020
This is the way I felt going up
to the line the first time,

633
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,250
in the war.

634
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,030
I mean. I was probably just as scared
as everyone else, but...

635
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,590
But inside I never felt better.

636
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,030
I felt...

637
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,180
I felt alive.
I felt full of blood.

638
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,700
I felt...

639
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,260
Everything just...

640
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,090
Everything seemed more real.
The guys in their uniforms.

641
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,990
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us...

642
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,310
All of us just... walking.

643
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,730
I mean I was scared of course, but

644
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,870
I just kept thinking: this is it.

645
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,030
You know?

646
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,500
This is the truth.

647
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,320
I felt that way once too.

648
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,830
When?

649
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,390
First time you made love to me.

650
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,660
All right, April.

651
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,460
What's up?

652
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,980
Bart Pollock's here.

653
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,200
He’s in Bandy’s office.

654
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,740
Big deal, huh?

655
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,530
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

656
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,290
Hey...

657
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,220
Keep my name out of it.

658
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,110
Frank.

659
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,360
Good to see you.

660
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,080
You know Bart Pollock?

661
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,960
Well, we never met, but...

662
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,160
- Of course I...
- Glad to know you, Frank.

663
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,420
Speaking of production control?

664
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,340
Frank...

665
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,000
This is a crackerjack.

666
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,940
They’re just tickled to death in Toledo.

667
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,330
Really?

668
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,800
So this guy Pollock was perfect
Presidential material in the worst sense.

669
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:32,020
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between his ears.

670
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,500
April, you should've heard this guy.

671
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,040
"Frank, this is a crackerjack."

672
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,420
What a horse’s ass.

673
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,090
Wish I've seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.

674
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,580
Yeah.

675
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,770
Here they come.

676
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,930
- Sorry to be late.
- You’re not late.

677
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,900
The traffic was terrible.

678
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,630
- You didn’t have to do that.
- Good to see you.

679
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,430
- Good to see you.
- Wasn’t it terrible, Howard?

680
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,180
Route 12.

681
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,095
About the time they finish
that stretch of road,

682
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,270
they’ll have to start all over again,
right?

683
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,070
And you must be John?

684
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,390
Say hello, John.

685
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,070
Nice to meetcha.

686
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,900
Heard a lot aboutcha.

687
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,800
Where are your darling children?

688
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,110
They’re at a birthday party.

689
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,670
Sorry they couldn’t be here.

690
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,850
Don’t worry. If I had a certified
lunatic coming around my house,

691
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,260
I’d probably get the kids
out of the way too.

692
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,580
Look at all this food!

693
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,680
You didn’t have to go
to any trouble for us.

694
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,450
It’s just some sandwiches.

695
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,690
John, would you like a sandwich?

696
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,850
Helen’s been talking it up about you
people for months.

697
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,710
The nice young Wheelers on
Revolutionary Road,

698
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,740
the nice young revolutionaries
on Wheeler road.

699
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,450
Would anyone like some Sherry?

700
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,100
Please, don’t bother Frank.

701
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,450
I’d like some sherry.

702
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,660
And I’ll drink Helen’s too.

703
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,940
if she doesn’t beat me to it.

704
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,560
Oh, hey...
You got a high-ball glass...?

705
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,660
Put a  couple-three ice cubes in it,

706
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,860
pour it up to the brim.

707
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,440
That’s the way I like it.

708
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,620
I think I can handle that.

709
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,190
This egg salad is delicious, April.

710
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,210
You must tell me how you fix it.

711
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,840
You a lawyer Frank?

712
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,580
No.

713
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:24,380
No, I’m not.

714
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,780
I could use a lawyer.

715
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,560
John, let’s not get started again
about the lawyer.

716
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,750
Pop, couldn’t you just sit there
and eat your wonderful egg salad,

717
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,810
and quit horning in?

718
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,640
See...

719
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,600
I’ve got a good many questions to ask

720
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,800
and I’m willing to pay for the answers...

721
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,870
Now, I don’t need to be told that a man

722
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,470
who goes after his mother
with a coffee table is

723
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,110
putting himself in a weak
position legally; that’s obvious.

724
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,770
John, come and have a look out this
fabulous picture window.

725
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,400
If he hits her with it and kills
her, that’s a criminal case.

726
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,970
Oh, look, the sun’s coming out!

727
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,270
If all he does is break the coffee table
and give her a certain amount of aggravation

728
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,720
and she decides to go to court over it,
that’s a civil case.

729
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,270
Maybe we’ll have a rainbow!

730
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,010
- John, come have a look.
- Ma, how about doing everybody a favor?

731
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,900
How about shutting up!

732
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,810
Seddle down, now.

733
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,150
Maybe I can look into it.

734
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,780
Recommend someone.
What you say?

735
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,440
So...

736
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:25,010
What do you do, Frank?

737
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,600
I work for
Knox Business Machines factory.

738
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,410
You design the machines?

739
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,350
Nope.

740
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,690
Make 'em, sell 'em, repair 'em?

741
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,030
All these questions.

742
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,170
I help sell them, I guess I...

743
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,190
I work in the office.

744
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,580
Actually, it's...

745
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,540
It's a sort of a stupid job really.
There's...

746
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,240
nothing interesting about it at all.

747
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,710
Whaddya do it for then?

748
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,710
Maybe Frank doesn’t like
to be questioned like this...

749
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,190
Okay, okay. Okay.

750
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,060
I know it’s none of my business.

751
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,010
And besides,

752
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,970
I know the answer.

753
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,680
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.

754
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,525
You want to play very nice house,

755
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:04,370
very sweet house,

756
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,770
then you got to have a job
you don’t like.

757
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,340
Anyone comes along and says
"Whaddya do it for?"

758
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,810
He’s probably on a four-hour pass
from the State funny farm.

759
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,230
All agreed..?

760
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,215
Ma..?

761
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:19,180
Sorry Frank.

762
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,440
No. Don’t be.

763
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,560
Don’t be.

764
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,780
Actually, John, I agree with...
everything you just said.

765
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,930
We both do. That’s why I’m quitting
the job in the fall. We're...

766
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,420
We’re taking off.

767
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,580
We’re moving to Paris.

768
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,490
Did you know about this, Ma...?

769
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,050
Wow.

770
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,340
How do you feel about that, Ma?

771
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,100
"The nice young Wheelers."

772
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,980
The nice young Wheelers.

773
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,990
Are taking off!

774
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,000
John, please.

775
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,180
Steady down, son.

776
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,530
John.

777
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,840
John!

778
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,080
How about some fresh air,
what you say?

779
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,950
If that’s all right with you?

780
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,730
I don’t know if it's such a good idea.

781
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,700
...If John wants to,
I don’t see the harm.

782
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,980
Good.

783
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,810
Do you..?

784
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,700
I hear you’re a mathematician.

785
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,580
You hear wrong.

786
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,930
It’s all gone now.

787
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,390
All gone?

788
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,430
You know what electrical shock
treatments are?

789
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,050
Yes.
Yes I do.

790
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,200
I’ve had thirty-seven.

791
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,480
Supposed to jolt out the
"Emotional Problems."

792
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,080
Just jolted out the mathematics.

793
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,360
How awful.

794
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,150
"How awful..."

795
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,300
Why?

796
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,230
Because mathematics is so "interesting?"

797
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,440
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and...

798
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,850
Well, because it’s awful not to be able
to do what it is you want to do.

799
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,720
I think mathematics must be dull.

800
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,410
I like your girl, Frank.

801
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,820
Me too.

802
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,330
So, what do a couple of people like
you have to run away from?

803
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,640
We’re not running.

804
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,020
So what’s in Paris?

805
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,630
A different way of life.

806
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,750
Maybe we are running...

807
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,800
We’re running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?

808
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,140
The hopeless emptiness?

809
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,880
Now, you’ve said it.

810
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,220
Plenty of people are on
to the emptiness, but...

811
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,660
it takes real guts to see
the hopelessness...

812
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,370
Wow.

813
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,220
You know,

814
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,000
he’s the first person who seemed to know
what we were talking about.

815
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,530
Well...

816
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,650
That’s true, isn't it?

817
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,980
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

818
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,490
If being crazy means...

819
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,920
living life as it matters

820
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,010
then I don’t care
if we are completely insane.

821
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,040
Do you?

822
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,060
No.

823
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,310
I love you so much.

824
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,780
Tell you something, Frank.

825
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:47,730
That Ted Bundy,

826
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,850
nice guy,

827
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,340
real sport.

828
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,160
xxx

829
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:56,500
I’m a little sore at the way he’s kept
you under a bushel all these years.

830
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,660
This place okay, for you?

831
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,390
Oh, it's just fine, sir.

832
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,920
Just fine.

833
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,530
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only:

834
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,290
selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman...

835
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,690
That’s why I’m assembling a team.

836
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,620
Men like you,

837
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,500
not your average salesmen...

838
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,940
It will mean more money,

839
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,580
and I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment,

840
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:23,100
but you’ll be a part of something
exciting, Wheeler...

841
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,710
Computers.

842
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,320
Well, sir...

843
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,050
It sounds exciting.

844
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,090
Bart!

845
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,520
Bart....

846
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,370
Bart, let me ask you a question.

847
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,280
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler?

848
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,120
Out of Yonkers?

849
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,430
Can’t say that I do.

850
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,920
Relation of yours?

851
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,320
My father.

852
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,830
He worked as a salesman for Knox
almost twenty years.

853
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,100
Earl Wheeler...

854
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,190
Earl Wheeler...

855
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:05,260
There's no reason you would remember.

856
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,880
Well, I’m sure he was a good man.

857
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,780
Listen, Bart, there is...

858
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,020
There’s something
I should have mentioned earlier...

859
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,160
I’m gonna be leaving the firm.
In the fall.

860
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,800
Another outfit?

861
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,960
No. No, it's not another outfit.

862
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,480
Now look, Frank.

863
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,380
Is it a question of money?

864
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,080
Because if it is, there’s no reason
we can’t get together on a satisfactory---

865
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,670
Oh. I appreciate that, but no, it's...

866
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,690
It’s not money. It's...

867
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,420
Well, it's more...

868
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,000
more of personal thing.

869
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,080
I hope you understand.

870
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,970
A personal thing?

871
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,040
I see.

872
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,340
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me...

873
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,670
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.

874
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,920
If he doesn’t grab ‘em by the balls,
it won’t be long before

875
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,670
he sitting around wondering
how he got to be second rate.

876
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,880
I guess so.

877
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,010
So, do me a favour...

878
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,610
Sleep on it.

879
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,770
Discuss it with your wife.

880
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,630
Because let’s be honest: where the hell would
any of us be without our wives, anyway?

881
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,800
And Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,

882
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,170
I believe it’ll be a thing
you’ll never regret.

883
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,730
And I believe something else, too.

884
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,250
I believe it’d be a fine memorial
to your Dad.

885
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,330
Think about it Frank.

886
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,340
Really think about it.

887
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,280
Knowing what you’ve got,

888
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,610
comma,

889
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,930
knowing what you need,

890
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,280
comma,

891
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,100
Knowing what you can do without,

892
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,190
dash.

893
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,750
That’s inventory control.

894
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,000
<i>Knowing what you’ve got,</i>

895
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,330

896
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,700
