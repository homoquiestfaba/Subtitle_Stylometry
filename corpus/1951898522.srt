1
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,796
Wow...

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,217
Looking good...

3
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,636
Oh, yeah, nice to see you.

4
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,524
Hey...

5
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:01,686
That dress needs dry-cleaning.

6
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,812
- Here you go.
- Thank you kindly, Monica.

7
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:09,731
Monica, Monica?
Oh shit, Hillary!

8
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,854
Okay...

9
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:19,236
- Hi, Bill.
- Oh hey Snowwhite.

10
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,563
Where's 11B?

11
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:25,488
Bingo!

12
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:28,281
What did you say that thing was?

13
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:32,403
It's time for a little action.

14
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:38,952
Monica... It's Bill.

15
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:41,622
I've got some dictation
for you, Monica.

16
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:44,909
I've got a big secret
for you, Baby.

17
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,685
How did you get up here
so soon?

18
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:52,836
Monica.

19
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:06,054
Oh my eyes!.
I can't see!

20
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:07,998
Who let you in!?

21
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,796
What happened... Where's Monica?
What happened to Monica?

22
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:14,632
- How did you get in here?
- She told me where the key was.

23
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,395
- I can't see.
- Did she say it was ok to dry-hump her roommate?

24
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:19,894
She said, you would be in the
library cause you were a geek...

25
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:22,453
I am not a geek!.
God!

26
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:26,219
My God.
What was that, mace?

27
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:30,232
"Eternity", by Calvin Klein.

28
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:37,065
I gotta be so careful who I
get into bed with from now on.

29
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:41,245
It would be a big adjustment
for you, wouldn't it?

30
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:44,838
God!

31
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,388
I do that every time.

32
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,450
I've invented a solution
for that. Seriously.

33
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,470
It is something that goes around the
coffee cup, so you don't burn your hand.

34
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:57,596
I'm gonna call it "The Coffee Collar".
Brilliant idea.

35
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:59,400
I know all about you.
I know you whole wrap.

36
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,869
- You do?
- Yeah. You're a senior...

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,436
who prays on freshmen. You've slept
with half my floor.

38
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:09,209
- Well, half your floor was female.
- What ever.

39
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,529
And you once met Bono,
which I suspect is total bullshit.

40
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,948
No, it's true.
He signed my CD.

41
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,973
It's upstairs in my room
with my...

42
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,912
"Coffee Collar",
if you wanna see it.

43
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,505
- Are you hitting on me?
- No. I'm going of your look.

44
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:26,505
- My look...
- Yeah, doggybull look.

45
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:29,833
- Are you calling me a dog?
- No, it's a theory I have.

46
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,164
- Oh, Casanova has a theory.
- Yeah. When a girl

47
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:34,824
is attracted to a guy, she has a look.
It's her tell, like poker.

48
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,627
It's the same look a dog gets,
right before you put down the bowl.

49
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:41,621
- You're offensive. And you're crazy.
- No, I'm honest.

50
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,353
I believe honesty is the best
policy.

51
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:45,789
Alright...
You want me to be honest with you?

52
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,320
- Sure.
- I'm majoring in fine art.

53
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:50,359
- Right.
- I'm studying the golden proportions

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,078
of the human face. And you're
nose is bent and

55
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,451
and it drips down at the bottom.
A feature that is excentuated

56
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,695
by the thinness of your upperlip.
And your eyes,

57
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,501
are too far apart,
but they have to be

58
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:02,354
to accominate that bent nose.
And I feel sorry for you,

59
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:06,451
that you have to validate yourself through
insatiable-meningless-ego-sport-sex,

60
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:08,179
with insecure girls like my roommate.

61
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,115
I... Would never have sex with
someone... Like you.

62
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,044
Hey come here!

63
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,897
That was amazing.

64
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:21,460
- What was?
- The honesty.

65
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,911
That was better than sex
without the... The crying.

66
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:27,013
- Actually it did feel pretty good.
- Yeah, no one's ever

67
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,807
been that honest with me before.
- It's called a friend.

68
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,162
I'm Tom, by the way.

69
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:32,844
- Hannah.
- Hannah? That's a palíndrome.

70
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:35,438
Well, good night.

71
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:37,314
Good night.

72
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:42,537
- Your hands, Clammy...
- Well, I can see that you're knocked out.

73
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:52,313
Tom, is that you?
Can I see your Bono-autograph?

74
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,809
She's all yours, friend.

75
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,100
Monica, get some sleep.

76
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:16,345
MADE OF HONOR

77
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:23,874
Subs by: Bentover87(translated and corrected from portugese)
Sync: NaNNa

78
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,137
What time is it?

79
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,467
I'm late.

80
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,728
What are you doing tonight?

81
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,275
I don't do "back to backs".

82
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:42,153
- Isn't that what we were doing last night?
- No, that was something different.

83
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:45,949
"Back to Backs" is seeing each other two
nights in a row. You know I don't do that.

84
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,007
- Couldn't you just break one of your stupid rules?
- No.

85
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,451
- For me.
- I'm sorry, but I don't break the rules.

86
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,620
I have a rule about that.

87
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:58,939
See you next week.

88
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,427
Thanks.

89
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:47,721
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

90
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:51,157
Can I get a grande drip,
and a decaff,

91
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,451
triple grande, non-fat,
extra hot, stirred milk como lafietta.

92
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,728
With whip cream,
extra caramel.

93
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,150
Fill that 70% of the way.
Thank you.

94
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:07,754
Here, let me put a "Coffee-
Collar" on that.

95
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,826
- Thank you.
- I hear that the guy that invented that

96
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,741
gets a dime for each one used.
- You're kidding.

97
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,912
I am not.
That could add up.

98
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,479
I think I picked up yours by accident.
Sorry about that.

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,180
- That's alright. Thank you.
- Any time.

100
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,534
Byebye.

101
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,579
Gloria.

102
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,023
Morning.

103
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,826
Good morning, Hannah.

104
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,276
Coffee, the way you like it.

105
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:25,071
Perfect timing. I just finished
working on his balls.

106
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:29,262
That's eh... Yeah!
So I made a reservation.

107
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:32,402
- So what rule is this?
- No "back to backs".

108
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,377
Isn't that the same as the
"no more than once a week"-rule?

109
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:37,010
No, the "no more than once a week"-rule
works monday to fridays.

110
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:40,824
So theoretically you could have a
sunday night and monday whithout breaking it.

111
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,577
Exactly, you got it.

112
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,766
Here we go.
Hey, good morning.

113
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,838
Can I get the steamed buns

114
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,429
the scallaped steamed ducklings
and the vegetarian and shrimp steamed...

115
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,629
- Thank you.
- For what?

116
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,266
You know how much I love the fried stuff.
You look after me.

117
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,243
Excelent.
So, what did you say?

118
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:01,494
- She was hurt, but you know...
- But you where honest, right?

119
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,130
What? I was.
I am. Always!

120
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:08,349
I know you are, but it's just shocking
to see how you use it as a shield.

121
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,503
Maybe I should lie.
Be more like Dennis Philips,

122
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:13,933
and say what ever it takes to get a woman into bed.
- No, do not be like Dennis Philips.

123
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:16,417
- He's so gross.
- He only hit on you once.

124
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:18,435
At my fathers funeral!

125
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,586
Okay, so he's not known
for his sensitivity.

126
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,496
Oh, God.
Anyways...

127
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,332
- What?
- Nothing.

128
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,735
I know that "nothing". It's not
nothing, it's something.

129
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,841
- "Anyway"...?
- Anyway we both know,

130
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:33,083
you don't need to lie to get a woman
into bed.

131
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,150
Gloria.

132
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,404
I don't wanna lose that.
Can I keep that? Thank you.

133
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,269
See there's another rule too.
The 24 hour-rule.

134
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,180
I can't call her for another
24 hours.

135
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,970
Cause then it appears
that I'm too desperate.

136
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:45,138
You know, Dan sent
me another letter?

137
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:47,198
Asking you to move to Canada
and marry him again?

138
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,699
- A slice of apple-crum pie?
- No, we did that last time.

139
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,172
- You guys broke up like a year ago.
- 19 months.

140
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:56,766
- You're counting?
- No! He is... It was in the letter.

141
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,625
Lemon butter cream cup?

142
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,703
Not feeling the cream cup today.

143
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:04,910
- Cranberry orange muffin?
- Hannah, come on. You're losing it.

144
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:07,372
- I know, I know... Okay.
- Think about it.

145
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:10,040
- Come on. You're disappointing.
- I got it, I got it...

146
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,339
- Yeah!
- Wait, I so have it...

147
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,854
Cream cheese soral brownie.

148
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,503
You're so good!

149
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,357
What do you think of this?
I think we should get this.

150
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:28,625
Tom, I am not going to another
one of your fathers weddings.

151
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,935
Thank you.
Hannah? Please?

152
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:34,015
Take one of the girls you've
been rubbing up against.

153
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:35,779
"No weddings or family events".

154
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,786
That's right.
I forgot that rule.

155
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:40,322
- It gives the wrong impression.
- It does.

156
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:46,618
- Is this made with real alligator?
- Yes, baby-alligator.

157
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:51,612
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Look at you.

158
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:55,115
Hello there...
And who would you be?

159
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:58,134
I love you. Yes I do.
I love you.

160
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:02,458
You're so pretty. Yes you are.
You're beatiful. Yes you are. Your beatiful face...

161
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,873
I love you, love you, love you.

162
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,952
You should try saying that to
a human sometime.

163
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,325
What?
A human?

164
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,569
To say it to a human?.

165
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:13,963
You're sweet.
Love you.

166
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:16,323
Hannah, please.
Come to the wedding.

167
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:20,648
He gets married and I go. I go because
he's my father and I care deeply for the man.

168
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,558
And everybody knows he doesn't love
them, and they don't love him.

169
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,560
It's pathetic, it breaks my heart.
I don't know what to say.

170
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,190
You know when someone's making a mistake
and it's not your place to interfer,

171
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,267
You simply say:
"I'm happy you're happy".

172
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,049
- I'm happy you're happy.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,084
Okay. I'll do that.

174
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:39,120
I promise you, this is the
last time I'll ask you to come.

175
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:41,269
And then I'll find somebody else
to come to the next funeral.

176
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:44,476
Hannah, please.

177
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,072
That's cute.

178
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,349
- Last time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

179
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:07,480
She gets the appartment in the city,
and 30 grand a month.

180
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:09,416
Right.
Right, okay.

181
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,945
You get the house in the Hamptons, she's
asking for the appartment in the city,

182
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:13,666
and 30 grand a month.
- Thirty? But...

183
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,397
Are you still negotiating
a pre-nup?

184
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:17,778
Now the party starts...
My son is here!

185
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:20,919
Dad, your getting married in 10 minutes.
Dad, please, I can't breathe.

186
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,928
- Did you bring the lovely Hannah?
- Yes, I did.

187
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,157
You know, if you don't act on that
pretty soon, you know what I'm gonna do?

188
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,507
- No.
- I'm gonna make her my number 6!

189
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,997
Seven...
This is number 6.

190
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:36,188
- Yeah.
- My God, you are pretty.

191
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:37,692
Dad!

192
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:41,806
- I used to be that pretty once.
- Dennis, look how pretty my boy is.

193
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:44,797
Yeah, he's beatiful. They won't
accept a minimum of 5 times a week.

194
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:47,859
- She promised 5, I want 5.
- What did she promise you, 5 times a week?

195
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:50,336
- 4 times?
- Two!

196
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,971
No, no...
We're not done yet.

197
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:57,091
- She says 3, with a by-monthly BJ.
- This is disturbing.

198
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,163
4 and make it weekly.

199
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:02,747
Wait, no... Driver go around the block.
We are not even close...

200
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,281
What was that?

201
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,333
Come on.
Come on, tell me.

202
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,898
- Say what you gotta say.
- I'm happy, If you're happy.

203
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,141
No, no... "You're
too old for her dad".

204
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,632
"She doesn't love you,
this is embarrasing".

205
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,065
"You're gonna rack up
your fifth divorce".

206
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,416
- Sixth.
- Sixth.

207
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,820
- I'm happy, if you're happy.
- Bullshit!

208
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:27,767
Go for 4 if you excercise more.

209
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,689
She says you can't gain
any more weight.

210
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,042
- Take it. Deal!
- Deal.

211
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,118
I told her I weigh 10 pounds
more than I do.

212
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,666
- Ain't love grand?
- Sign the both please.

213
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,872
What's he signing now?
His current pre-nup and his last divorce-papers.

214
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:39,304
That's just great...

215
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,467
Your good. Thank you.

216
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,430
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

217
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:31,222
- Did you tell your dad you love him?
- I told him I cared for him.

218
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,828
You can't even tell your father.

219
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:35,190
- I don't get that.
- It's a "Guy thing".

220
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:38,108
No, it's a "Tom thing".

221
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:41,745
- You're an "I love you-slut".
- Are you kidding me?

222
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,581
You say it all the time.
To everybody.

223
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:47,112
- Oh, this looks so good.
- Yeah, it looks good doesn't it?

224
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,370
I should have ordered this. this look good.
You always order better than I do.

225
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:57,430
It's lemon, right? It's good.
I'm ordering that from now on.

226
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:58,571
- No, you won't.
- Why?

227
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,460
I need you to order the chocolate cake
so I can have some.

228
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,501
- There's my "son"!
- There you go...

229
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:09,259
Oh, you're bad boy
I'm gonna spank you.

230
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:12,523
You know what I would like
to say to you? Is that...

231
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:16,099
- I want you to listen to me, Tom.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,828
If you need any advice...

233
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,800
- or you need any advice...
- Right.

234
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:23,410
Or you got girl problems,
I don't know...

235
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:28,407
I need you to think of me how you
would a real mother.

236
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:31,306
- Yeah that's excactly what I...
- Look at this beauty, will you?

237
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,709
Hello, Sweety

238
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,244
Drunk as the night I first
met her.

239
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,677
- You are a bad influence on her.
- Me?

240
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,028
- Last shot?
- Thanks.

241
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,916
- I'm stealing you away...
- Last one...

242
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:52,411
- He does know that he can just date, right?
- No, I don't think he does.

243
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,607
- To mothers.
- To mothers. Cheers.

244
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,701
Careful.

245
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:03,235
Nice...

246
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,018
Oh God...

247
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,643
Hide me!

248
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:18,058
- What?
- It's my dads patient cordinator.

249
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,466
Yeah, don't look, don't look...
There... Don't look!

250
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,818
She's obsessed with me.

251
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,683
She's created a website called
"allthingstom.org".

252
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:26,552
- A Psychoblogger?
- Yes.

253
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,988
Okay. Come on...
Dance with me.

254
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:30,568
- Watch yourself.
- She's kind of cute.

255
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:31,984
- Oh stop it.
- I'm serious...

256
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,335
Keep going.

257
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:39,139
Here. Right here. Hide me.
back side, side. Go, go...

258
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:45,384
The last blog was a 2 page description
of my face.

259
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:48,924
See, she doesn't think my nose is too
bent or my lips are too thin.

260
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,501
- Who said that?
- You did. When we met.

261
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:53,831
- Well, I lied.
- What?

262
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:58,839
- I thought you were hot.
- Really?

263
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,126
Well, you told me I looked
like a dog.

264
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:03,052
That was just cause I was
trying to sleep with you.

265
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:04,704
Why haven't you since?

266
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:09,579
Well... I like having you
in my life.

267
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,689
- ...
- Hi, Tom!

268
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,390
- Oh, hi!
- Did you see the new blog?

269
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,144
No, we haven't.

270
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,829
- Who's this?
- This? This is my girlfriend.

271
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:21,844
Why didn't you tell me you
were seeing someone?

272
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:22,865
Because I don't know you.

273
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,517
But we have a really, really
open relationship...

274
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,259
- Really?
- You know? I wanted to talk to you about that,

275
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,790
- princess.
- Princess?

276
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,212
I... I don't wanna be with
anybody but you.

277
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,616
I don't know if i'm really quite
ready to make that commitment...

278
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,828
- Are you?
- You know my rules...

279
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:38,647
- I'm bit of an emonitional retard.
- Yeah...

280
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,384
I think I need to start a new blog now.

281
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,833
- That is so scary.
- She's psychotic on top of P..

282
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,185
Oh, this is not good.

283
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,789
- Saia da minha frente.
- Ei!

284
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,053
Okay, good... She's gone.
Perfect. Let's go.

285
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:05,004
Good, come on.
What?

286
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,075
Do you remember that encestral
home in scotland,

287
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,834
with those amazing paintings
I told you about?

288
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,464
- It's all I think about.
- Stop it, Tom.

289
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,929
I finally got the board to
sign of

290
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,840
on making editions to a
permanent collection.

291
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,282
Really?

292
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,641
But they want me to go to
Scotland for an aquisitionstrip.

293
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,346
- When are you going?
- A couple of days.

294
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,020
- Couple of days? For how long?
- Six weeks.

295
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,283
That's a long time.

296
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:32,567
- That's great.
- You think?

297
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:34,802
Yes, it's a great opportunity
for you.

298
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:37,055
You're like the
"museum maiden of the Met".

299
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,559
It's got a good ring to it...

300
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:45,319
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

301
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:49,446
Six sundays.

302
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,792
- That is six sundays.
- What am I gonna do without you?

303
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,921
I can just imagine.

304
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,566
- Yeah...
- What are you doing?

305
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,824
- I'm gonna jump!
- No, no.

306
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,113
- I'm gonna jump.
- Jesus!

307
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,210
Six sundays,
how can I live without you?

308
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:06,528
Can you not take
anything seriously?

309
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,602
- Yeah, I can.
- Get down.

310
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,738
- Let's get you another drink.
- I think I've had too many already.

311
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:15,100
- Thanks for coming too the wedding.
- It was a ball,

312
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:18,107
- I can't wait for number seven.
- It's coming up soon, I have a feeling.

313
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,747
We also ask at this time that
you turn off all your electronic devices.

314
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:26,888
Please leave your cellphones turned
off for the duration of the flight.

315
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:44,782
- I'm not gonna be able to play today, man.

316
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:47,102
If we don't have a fourth, we are gonna
end up playing with "Tiny-Shorts Guy".

317
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:48,376
- So?
- Hey, how's it going?

318
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,909
- Need a nother?
- No, our friend Paul,

319
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,925
- with longer shorts, is coming.
- Right.

320
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,386
No, Jenny signed him up
for some art walk thing...

321
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,112
Art walk? Are you serious?
Tell me something,

322
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,350
What do you think Jenny did with his balls
when she cut them off?

323
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,040
Come on, guys,
marriage isn't that bad.

324
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,029
I agree. Without marriage
there would be no divorce,

325
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,352
and without divorce I wouldn't
have my condo in Aspen.

326
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:05,866
Bingo.

327
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:08,081
- Good one.
- What is he?

328
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:11,262
I'm serious, man.
Your missing out on the best parts of life.

329
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:14,388
- The most important part of life.
- This coming from the guy who's wife

330
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:15,889
won't let him own porn.
He's gotta wank off

331
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,271
to the underwear section
of the Sears catalougue.

332
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:20,617
I thought we weren't gonna talk
about that?

333
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,406
What's the matter with you?
You are single and you've been single,

334
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,605
ever since...
What was her name?

335
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:28,180
- Sophmore year.
- Plim... Pimpkin, Pimpkin, that's it.

336
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,992
Pimpkin dumped you for him.

337
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:32,721
Sophmore year, you've never been the same
you haven't been able to sleep.

338
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:36,201
- Scarred...
- Yeah. You have no idea, how nice it is

339
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:39,305
to have someone who is gonna be there,
no matter what, what ever.

340
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,890
- Snaps to that.
- And you don't know how nice it is

341
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:43,923
to sleep with a different
girl every night.

342
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:46,693
- That's true.
- Nice revital.

343
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,715
You got the best of both worlds, Tom.

344
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:51,926
No, it's true.
I can sleep with whoever I want,

345
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:53,512
But I still get to hang
out with Hannah afterwards.

346
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,982
- Perfect setup.
- Yeah, well maybe not for Hannah...

347
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,929
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Come on, Tom. She's a woman.

348
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,154
Yeah, I got that.

349
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,214
- You sure?
- Yeah.

350
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:04,101
Tom, she's pushing 30.
You think her idea of

351
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:06,478
"Happily ever after" is
coming home to you

352
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,552
and hanging out after
you got laid?

353
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:11,164
- Makes you think, right?
- Yeah.

354
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,881
- Hallo?
- Hey.

355
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:25,057
- Hi.
- How's the weather in England?

356
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,181
It's great.
Only I'm in Scotland.

357
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:32,559
Right, right.
So it's sunny?

358
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:37,785
It's 3 in the morning.
- Oh, right. Sorry.

359
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:39,136
- So it's dark.
- Yeah.

360
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,886
Have you seen the Loch Ness Monster?

361
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:46,150
- I know, terrible joke...
- Was there something important?

362
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:47,880
Yeah. You'll
never guess what happened.

363
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:50,219
- What?
- They filled in the pot hole.

364
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,954
- The pot hole?
- On 83rd.

365
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:56,063
- Terrific... Hey, Tom?.
- Yeah?

366
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,648
- I'm gonna go back to sleep now.
- Ok. Sure.

367
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,494
Love you.

368
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,779
Good night...
Call me tomorrow.

369
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:16,396
- This stuff's all old...
- Yeah, that's the point.

370
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:19,019
- Let's go to Fendi...
- Fendi? No.

371
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,195
We're here,
let's just stay here.

372
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,613
I'm not into old stuff.

373
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:25,333
Why do you talk like
a six-year-old?

374
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:26,685
I'm not.

375
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,671
The line is too long...

376
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,756
- Can't we just go somewhere else?
- No.

377
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:35,911
This is the best bakery in the world.
That's why it's worth waiting in line.

378
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,865
Come on.
We'll play a game.

379
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,387
- Wanna play a game?
- Yeah, I can play a game.

380
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:41,738
Okay. Good.

381
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:43,969
- Tell me what to order.
- Why?

382
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,742
You'll see. It will be fun.
Make a suggestion.

383
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:50,373
- A cookie.
- No, you have to be specific,

384
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:51,724
like what type of cookie...

385
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,686
A really big cookie.

386
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,419
Tom, your phone's
ringing...

387
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:13,547
Hallo. Hallo?

388
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,041
Hallo...

389
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,060
- What's wrong?
- Just an important call.

390
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,281
That's because you are
an important person.

391
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:26,626
Wait! Hey...

392
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,990
We will have...

393
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:33,436
2 fried dumplings, 2 of the watons
and 6 of the fried "pork-thingies".

394
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:37,823
- Yeah. But that's fried. It's not healthy.
- Oh, come on. Have some of the fried...

395
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:39,175
It won't hurt you.

396
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,234
Thank you.

397
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:45,094
Move, please!.

398
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:47,077
God.

399
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:49,699
This is unbelievable.

400
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,811
- Hallo?
- Hey, hallo?

401
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:54,321
- Hallo?
- Hannah?

402
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:55,999
- Hallo?
- Hey.

403
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,823
Tom?
Tom is that you?

404
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,232
- Tom?
- Hallo?

405
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,517
Hallo? You're cutting out,
I can't hear anything you're saying.

406
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:06,954
Tom? I'm stuck in a
thunderstorm.

407
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm surrounded by a wall
of calves.

408
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:11,913
- I'll call you when I get to the hotel...
- I can't hear you.

409
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,510
Tom?

410
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:27,709
Hallo.

411
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,406
Hallo! Hallo?

412
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:33,720
Hallo?

413
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:44,095
I hate Scotland.

414
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,199
- Having a hard time?
- We're having a hard time...

415
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,280
- Oh yeah? Wan't a hand?
- Thank you, sir.

416
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,721
- Yeah.
- We would love it.

417
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:19,280
- You'd better sit down, sir.
- ...

418
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,164
- Sit down.
- Sit, sit, sit.

419
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,855
Here we go.

420
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:25,680
- Thank you.
- No, no, thank you.

421
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,518
- Thank you.
- Have a good afternoon.

422
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,220
You were wonderful.

423
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:44,988
- Desista enquanto pode.
- Here we go.

424
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:47,803
- Come on, Scott.
- Let's go.

425
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,516
What you got, Gar?
What you got, Gar? What do you got?

426
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,782
- Come on.
- What do you got, Gary?

427
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:57,056
Foul! Foul, Tom!
What the matter with you today?

428
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:59,441
Ahh... I think I might have
feelings for Hannah.

429
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:04,781
Come on, come on...
Let's just play.

430
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:07,622
It's just...

431
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,979
Without her, somethings off,
and it's got me thinking that maybe

432
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,408
there's more to life than
just sleeping around.

433
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:18,012
- I don't understand...
- I'm not following...

434
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,079
Come on, let's just play.
Come on.

435
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,213
- I'll take it out.
- I know exactly what you mean, Tom.

436
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,726
Thanks. Here you go.

437
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:28,183
I'm gonna tell Hannah.
When she gets home,

438
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:31,145
I'm gonna tell her that i wanna be with her,
not marriage, just be together.

439
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:32,886
Yeah, that's romantic...

440
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:38,205
>You have one unheard
message<

441
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:42,158
Hey, Tom. I'm back.
God, I cannot wait to see you.

442
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:44,267
I don't care what you're
doing tonight, cancel it.

443
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:45,528
We're going to dinner.

444
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:46,919
Meet me at that new
trendy place,

445
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,479
next to the small greek place we hated,
that used to be the Thai-fusion place we loved.

446
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,726
Meet me there 8 o'clock,
I have so much to tell you.

447
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:09,048
- Hey, what have you got?
- Hey Buddy. I'll find you something.

448
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:11,201
Alright...

449
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:13,539
Here's something.
How many do you want?

450
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,502
- I'll take the yellow ones.
- Good choice. Ten bucks.

451
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,478
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

452
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,983
- Have a good night.
- I will.

453
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,809
- Sorry, is she already here?
- Over there.

454
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,338
Yeah, thanks.

455
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,625
Oh, God!

456
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:08,889
- Tom, are you okay?
- I'm alright. Are you alright?

457
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,734
I think I have a broken rib.

458
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,785
- Your flowers, sir.
- They're not mine! I'm fine, I'm okay!.

459
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:14,174
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

460
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:16,116
- I'm so sorry.
- You alright?

461
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:18,077
- Here are your flowers.
- What, what...

462
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:19,729
- You had flowers?
- They're not my flowers.

463
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,803
- They're your flowers.
- I didn't have flowers.

464
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:24,090
- Hi! It's so good to see you!
- I've missed you.

465
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:26,916
- Great.
- Come here, there's someone I want you to meet.

466
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:28,291
Oh good.

467
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:32,113
It started pouring and suddenly it
was just me in a field of cows.

468
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:35,025
And, of course we're in Europe
so there's no street signs anywhere

469
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:36,818
- and it's getting dark...
- And then she thought she was in

470
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:40,371
some bad whalewolf movie.
"Stay off the moors, Lassie".

471
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:47,023
Anyway... all of the sudden, out of nowhere,
Colin comes riding up on horseback.

472
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,736
- Can you believe it? A horse.
- Oh...

473
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:50,530
He asked me if I
needed any help.

474
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:52,753
You were a "Lady in distress",
what was I supposed to do?

475
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:55,197
It was right out of a Brontë-novel.

476
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:59,688
So anyway... He shows me
to this charming little Inn,

477
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:02,911
Were he procedes to buy me
the most awful dinner I've ever had.

478
00:30:02,912 --> 00:30:06,864
It was pretty bad,
even by scottish standards.

479
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,695
Then we just spend the next
month travelling around the country,

480
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:14,101
getting to know each other,
visiting museums... It was..

481
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,043
- Perfect!
- Perfect!

482
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,003
So... When it was time for
Hannah to leave, I just...

483
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,078
I don't know, I just...
Couldn't let her go.

484
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:31,560
- So I got down on one knee...
- And he proposed. And I accepted!

485
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:35,508
- Wow! That's just... Huge, it's...
- So the wedding's coming together very quickly.

486
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,589
- Sounds like it.
- We're gonna be married in Scotland,

487
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,837
- At Colin's parents summer home.
- It's gonna be a pretty small thing.

488
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,163
We can't expect too many people
making the trip over sea, just for a night.

489
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,685
- The Fourth?
- Right.

490
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,588
- That's two weeks!
- It's crazy, isn't it?

491
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:49,662
- Have you ever been to Scotland, Tom?
- You know, I haven't.

492
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:53,997
- You should see the wee church we're gonna have.
- It's the same one Colin's parent's were married in.

493
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:56,554
It's pretty spectacular, just a walk
from my destillery.

494
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,411
- Destillery?
- Colin's famliy owns the largest

495
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:01,131
whiskey destillery in
Scotland.

496
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:06,107
Tom.. Look, If you're getting married
I expect to be your "Best Man".

497
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:10,673
Tom... Will you be my
"Maid of Honor"?

498
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,490
Your "Maid of Honor"?

499
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:19,514
Sorry.

500
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,301
What is it with you, man?
I didn't...

501
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:28,917
Excuse me... Excuse me!
Did you see that?

502
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,838
"Made of Honor"?

503
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:35,407
That's fun stuff!
But you're a guy!

504
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:37,557
Go ahead...
Just get it out.

505
00:31:37,652 --> 00:31:39,691
So, what did you say?

506
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:41,087
- Did you say yes?
- No!

507
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,022
- No?
- I didn't know what to say. I told her I'd think about it.

508
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:46,162
You need to think about wether your
dress is gonna make your ass look big!

509
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:48,880
- Give me a break, come on!
- Okay. Alright, let me think.

510
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,949
- Is she really in to this guy?
- You should have seen them.

511
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,229
Staring at him all moony
like he shits unicorns.

512
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,479
That's not good, man.
I'm thinking you're gonna have to do this.

513
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,824
You're gonna have to be
the Maid of Honer.

514
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:59,026
- What?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Think about it,

515
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:01,640
this will give you an excuse to be
around Hannah all the time.

516
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:05,448
Helping her out, being
"the man behind the curtain"...

517
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,435
You'll be her confident.

518
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:10,467
And you can use that time to point
out to Hannah that this is really crazy.

519
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:13,908
- And that she doesn't even know this guy at all!
- No, I'm not gonna do that. No way.

520
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:15,160
- What?
- No.

521
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:18,449
Look, I don't know what your
other options are.

522
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,104
You got a better chance of stopping
this wedding,

523
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,319
from "inside"
than from another continent.

524
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:27,258
And they say that you can
shorten this and wear it again, if you like.

525
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,970
Come on man. If you're serious and you
really want Hanna back from this guy,

526
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:34,348
You're gonna have to
do whatever it takes.

527
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:37,012
Whatever.

528
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:49,809
- The dress is beautiful.
- Thank you!

529
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:54,273
- I am so happy you're gonna do this!
- My pleasure.

530
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,820
For this wedding, I am willing
to do what ever it takes.

531
00:32:56,837 --> 00:32:58,695
- I'm so excited!
- Yeah, me too!

532
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:00,804
So let me tell you who the
other bridesmaids are gonna be.

533
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:01,918
- Okay!
- Okay. Stephanie...

534
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,665
- Stephanie, great.
- And she loves you!

535
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,219
- Good!
- And my friend Hillary, from camp.

536
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,235
Hillary, I don't know Hillary.

537
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:07,750
- She's the best
- Okay.

538
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:10,180
- And Melissa.
- Oh, no!

539
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:12,712
- I had to, Tom, she's my cousin.
- No, she hates me!

540
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:15,151
- Well, you broke her heart.
- She broke my nose.

541
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:17,431
- It was an accident.
- She hit me with her fist!

542
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:19,637
I was completely honest with her.
I said: "Look, nothing serious".

543
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:21,632
And she agreed.

544
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:23,603
So sometimes our hearts don't
match our mouths.

545
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:24,822
That's good, you should
put that in your vowes.

546
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:27,986
And, she's been wanting to be my
maid of honor since we were 5 years old,

547
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:29,932
so now she's really gonna
hate you.

548
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:31,197
Here they are now.

549
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:34,501
Okay. Well as your Maid of Honor,
I promise to keep the peace.

550
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:49,135
Oh, hi!

551
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:51,687
Yes! The bride to be!

552
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:53,324
- Hello, you must be Tom.
- And you must be Hillary.

553
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,744
You look gorgeous.

554
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:58,187
Stephanie, how are you doing?
So good to see you.

555
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:00,933
- Are you kidding!
- It's you, Melissa.

556
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:03,212
Look at that...

557
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,517
- This was great.
- This isn't akward...

558
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:10,612
Go on.
I'm gonna be fine.

559
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:20,755
- Tom, have you met Colin yet?
- Yes.

560
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,311
- Isn't he dreamy?
- Absolutely.

561
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:27,776
Could someone please pass
me the Splenda?

562
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:32,178
Could someone who's not a masogenist,
please pass the Splenda?

563
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,361
- Hallo?
- Thank you, Stephanie.

564
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,258
It's Colin, you guys.

565
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,456
Hi, babe!
Just a sec... Hi!

566
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:47,310
So cute!

567
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,771
We only have 9 days before
we leave for Scotland,

568
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,295
- so we have to act quickly.
- Excactly.

569
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:54,483
I've been a "MOH" 6 times,
so I'll organize everything

570
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:57,996
that needs to be done, even though
I'm not officially the "MOH" here.

571
00:34:57,997 --> 00:35:00,676
- What is a "MOH"?
- M-O-H.

572
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:01,867
Maid Of Honor.

573
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:04,039
- Yes!
- Oh, yes. That's clever.

574
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,554
No, it's going great.
Very smoothly.

575
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:11,522
So we got the bridal shower
bachorlerette, dress fittings,

576
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:12,817
- The "kilt"...
- I'll do the "kilt".

577
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:14,789
- Okay... perfect.
- Okay.

578
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,190
Shopping for Hannah's true self...

579
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:19,139
- That's gonna be great.
- So, what is Hannah's true self?

580
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,549
It's lingerie. For her
wedding night.

581
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,280
How do you expect to be a good
"MOH" if you don't even know that.

582
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,728
- She's talking to me.
- No, I didn't!.

583
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:31,221
- You just did.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.

584
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:33,470
Did I break a rule?

585
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,753
How about we focus on the
wedding part?

586
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:36,907
- Good idea.
- Just for now...

587
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:38,483
Okay, I need, dress sizes.

588
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,152
- I'm a four.
- Okay.

589
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:43,319
- Eight.
- Sorry?.

590
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:49,204
You know, Hillary...
Do you think that maybe you'd just be more

591
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:53,148
- confortable in like a, twelve?
- No, it will be fine.

592
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:56,126
- I'm doing the Dr. Riverbed fast.
- Oh, yeah!

593
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:57,591
- Yeah.
- What is that?

594
00:35:57,592 --> 00:36:00,091
Water, peachraisin/aplepect in shark extract,

595
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:01,976
And Lowry's Seasoning Salt.

596
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:04,428
- What about food?
- Look,

597
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,883
I'm going to look amazing in that dress,
I am going to meet a Scottish man, and...

598
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:12,306
I'm gonna be happy!
Write down an eight!

599
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:13,433
Got it.

600
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,753
What's your dress size,
Made Of Honor?

601
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:18,107
I don't know. What's your jock
size, Melissa?

602
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,966
That's enough! Enough!

603
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:23,613
Sorry. But will you guys
look at Hannah, please.

604
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,571
She's happy, finally.

605
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:28,377
So please, for Hannah,
let's all just get along,

606
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:31,186
put a smile on our faces
and pretend everything's perfect!

607
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:33,778
- Here she comes.
- Okay. Fine.

608
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,628
- What did he say?
- He's so sweet!

609
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,027
Isn't that great?

610
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,569
How's it going?

611
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,348
- Good, really good.
- Fantastic.

612
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,788
- And it's pretty much done.
- Perfect, really?

613
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:53,084
- Tom.
- Yes?

614
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:55,212
- Here.
- What is this?

615
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:58,277
She does bridal shower entertainment.
And I hired her for Stephanie's sisters shower,

616
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,997
and Hannah loved it. She reads Tarot
cards and stuff.

617
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:02,464
That's great.
Thank you, Melissa.

618
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:04,610
I'm not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for Hannah.

619
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:07,758
Okay.
Thank you, for Hannah.

620
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,882
It should have been me...

621
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:09,884
- I'll talk with you tommorow.
- Okay.

622
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:11,108
- Bye, Tom.
- Goodbye.

623
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,565
- Bye, Hillary.
- Nice meeting you.

624
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,566
You too, bye.

625
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,716
I just had a very nice
bonding moment with Melissa.

626
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,910
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

627
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,736
My mother and grandmother are
coming in to town tomorrow,

628
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:22,087
And I have so much to plan...

629
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:25,295
I was wondering if you and the boys could
entertain Colin for the day.

630
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:27,672
- Entertain him?
- Yeah, just kind of get to know him and stuff.

631
00:37:27,673 --> 00:37:29,428
- Sure.
- Cool.

632
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:34,466
So are you more proud of
"Scotch Tape" or McDonald's?

633
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,499
I think they're both american.

634
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,674
- So wait, you invited this guy to play ball with us?
- Yeah, he's the competition.

635
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,834
I need to get to know his
strengths and weaknesses.

636
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:45,275
I like his green shirts.
Is that like a poly blend kind of thing?

637
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:46,435
Yeah, it's my shirt

638
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:47,590
- It's your shirt?
- Yeah.

639
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:49,130
- Looks good on him, huh?
- Yeah, real good.

640
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,104
Why don't you play with him?

641
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:52,782
Thanks.

642
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:54,662
Colin, have you ever played
basketball before?

643
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:58,318
We would call this "netball",
back in Scotland, it's more of a woman's game,

644
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,394
so, no I don't have much
experience.

645
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,196
- Hi, I do. Need one more?
- We're good.

646
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,941
Alright.

647
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:08,263
- Alright, "girls", you ready?
- Yeah, I am.

648
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:10,296
Oh.
Use your hands.

649
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:12,585
- You alright there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

650
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:15,126
- I'm open. I'm open.
- Here we go.

651
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,203
You gotta hold on to the ball, man!
Hold on to the ball.

652
00:38:19,408 --> 00:38:22,047
Homos! Homos!
Homos.

653
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,039
Let's get the scottish girl
out if the tree.

654
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,122
You wanna start a game cause
you didn't get that.

655
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:27,723
There you go.
Open. Open.

656
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,171
Here you go. That was good.
Good.

657
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,686
Good.
Amiga.

658
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:32,716
Shoot it. Guys.

659
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:35,481
- I like it!
- I'm sorry.

660
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,101
- Come on!
- Get on the path.

661
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:43,769
You ok?

662
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,846
Ok, basket.
Put it in the basket! Put it in the basket!

663
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:49,486
- You know what I'm learning?
The guy's a chump.

664
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,034
Yeah.

665
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:53,660
- Wow, "Fault".
- There it is. That's it.

666
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,554
That's it! That's it!
We got it now.

667
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:57,295
Hey, I look good now, don't I?

668
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:59,162
Here we go.

669
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,009
Put it in the basket!

670
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:05,894
- In the basket!
- Take a shot, chief!

671
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:12,395
- Sorry, guys.
- Did you see that?

672
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,486
Probably not allowed to just
stuff it in like that.

673
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:15,906
- He dunks the ball.
- Sorry. Sorry.

674
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:18,042
He dunks the ball...

675
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:22,804
That was awsome! You can dunk!
He can dunk! That is awsome.

676
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:24,518
If that's allowed, why
don't you guys all do it?

677
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:27,151
If we could, we would.
Right?

678
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:28,738
- Play?
- Guys.

679
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:31,819
- No.
- Yeah!

680
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:44,177
- Score!
- Yeah.

681
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,268
- Yes!
- Good game, yeah, good game.

682
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,732
My brother!

683
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,471
- Looks like you're getting more competition..
- I know, I know...

684
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:58,910
I love this guy!

685
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,994
Shit.

686
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,770
- You alright?
- Yeah.

687
00:40:16,771 --> 00:40:18,381
What happening?

688
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:22,266
My boy's got mad cow
disease.

689
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:25,487
We have got to get some dirt
on this guy.

690
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:28,394
I got a guy I use when a spouse
suspect infedility.

691
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:31,287
Everybody's got skeletons in the closet.
Nobody is skweeky-clean,

692
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:33,829
- and my guy's the best.
- I don't know, it just seems so cheep.

693
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,192
Don't worry, I'll charge you dubble
because you're rich.

694
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:37,758
I mean, it's a cheep thing to do.

695
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:40,449
- He play's cheep, you gotta match that.
- How does Colin play cheep?

696
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,581
That whole thing with
Hannah, being scottish.

697
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,569
Making her fall in love
with him in Scotland.

698
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,594
That "monster thing" of his.

699
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,312
Fine.
Get the dirt.

700
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:55,662
That's cool.

701
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,679
VIA ESPRESSA NASSAU/VAN WYCK
AEROPORTO KENNEDY A 2.5 KM

702
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,868
What's he gonna do,
eat her?

703
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:14,276
Come on, come on.
Take a breath. Take a...

704
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,981
Thanks, Tom.

705
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:25,384
- Yeah, have a great flight.
- Right. Thanks, mate.

706
00:41:26,814 --> 00:41:29,140
Come on...

707
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:34,410
- I love you, Colin.
- Bye.

708
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,851
Bye.

709
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:43,717
- Yeah...
- My God.

710
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:46,989
- Need some chap stick?
- Yeah...

711
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,886
So... What church should
we go to?

712
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:50,237
Grace's Church.

713
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,949
Thank you so much for coming
with me to meet the reverend.

714
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,127
- No problem.
- He is the sweetest man...

715
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:05,128
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

716
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:09,110
He married my parents and insisted
on coming to Scotland to do my wedding.

717
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,218
Why didn't Colin stay and do
this with you?

718
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:13,660
It was more important for him
to go back to Scotland to pertition

719
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:16,167
The Grand Counsil
so Colin and I could get married.

720
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:17,978
I don't know. Grand?
What does that mean?

721
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,851
I'm not Scottish and his family
is kind of...

722
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:22,290
What?

723
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:23,641
Royalty.

724
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,430
Royalty?

725
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,588
- Royalty? Is he like a King?
- No!. No, he's a Duke.

726
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,288
A Duke?

727
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:42,608
- Hannah, darling.
- Reverend Foote.

728
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:46,892
And this must be the lucky young man
who is marrying our beautiful Hannah.

729
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:48,169
Oh, no.

730
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,486
- I'm not marrying him
- No...

731
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,798
This is Tom,
my "Maid Of Honor".

732
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:54,901
- Maid of Honor?
- Yes.

733
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:56,632
How about that...

734
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:00,080
We have many gay and lesbian
members of the congregation.

735
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,334
Welcome.

736
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:13,493
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Reverend.

737
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:19,800
So...

738
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:21,716
- Let's talk about the wedding.
- Okay.

739
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:24,383
I need to get some details
about you and...

740
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,172
- Colin.
- Colin, yes.

741
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:28,786
I want to work it
in to the ceremony.

742
00:43:28,787 --> 00:43:31,617
Okay. It was such a
whirl wind. Really...

743
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:34,189
Yes, enlighten me.
Tell me about it.

744
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,179
Hannah, darling.

745
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,147
Hannah, I think it's important
to dig deep her for the vowes

746
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:43,759
and tell the Reverend all
you know about Colin.

747
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,540
- All that you love about him.
- Okay.

748
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:46,610
And not just the obvious stuff,

749
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,597
but those unique characteristics
that are Colin.

750
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:54,173
Those things that make you
laugh and say...

751
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,125
"That's so Colin".

752
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,027
Right...

753
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:03,040
And then, maybe you could get some
information from Colin...

754
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:07,023
and emphasize their unique bond,
their shared history.

755
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:08,378
Off course.

756
00:44:09,404 --> 00:44:11,507
We could talk about
love at first sight.

757
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:14,577
Well, that's always a
crowd pleaser, but...

758
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:16,403
Hannah... Elaborate...

759
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,494
Tell me more about him.
How you feel about him.

760
00:44:25,937 --> 00:44:27,321
Where did you meet?

761
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:28,673
- In Scotland...
- Modigliani!

762
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,890
Your first summer in New York City,
you were dating a guy who worked on Wall Street...

763
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:35,345
and he asked you to move in
with him and you weren't quite sure...

764
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:37,674
And it was right around that time
that you "discovered" Modigliani...

765
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,457
And became obsessed
with this painting...

766
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,992
of this woman who had this
blue scarf on, holding a baby.

767
00:44:42,993 --> 00:44:44,914
And Hannah said: "That
painting captured the essens

768
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,165
of that woman better
than any photograph".

769
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,372
I can't believe you
can remember that.

770
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:52,111
I also remembered that she
freaked, because she said she felt more

771
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:55,066
passionate about that painting
than she did obut "Mr. Wall Street"...

772
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,734
And she wondered if she could
ever meet somebody

773
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,768
that could make her feel this
passionate as that work of art.

774
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,571
That's good.

775
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:03,484
That's good.

776
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:05,322
Modigliani.

777
00:45:05,323 --> 00:45:08,309
Now I know why you picked
him to be "Maid of Honor".

778
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,661
Yes...

779
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:15,641
Come on! Who's ready to loose some
money tonight! Because I'm feeling lucky!

780
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:16,659
You guys are late.
How you doing?

781
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,660
- How you holding up, champ?
- Stressed.

782
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,200
What the hell is this?

783
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:22,271
- Hannah's shower's in the morning .
- Well where are we gonna play?

784
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:24,127
We're not gonna play until
these baskets get done,

785
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:25,322
and everything else gets done.

786
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:28,006
- What about this party mix?
- That's "pot-pourri".

787
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:30,101
This is perfect...

788
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,196
- Come on Felix, take that off...
- Have you ever had one of these?

789
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,749
- That's funny...
- You can't even see.

790
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,110
You'll have to,
to sleep with you...

791
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:36,678
- Take this.
- You could be like blinded.

792
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,850
No, I'm not playing with baskets.
It's poker night.

793
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:44,419
You put "Bayberry" with "Serenidade".

794
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,982
- You don't like?
- No, it's interesting.

795
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:48,294
Just thought it was obvious that
"Bayberry" worked best with "Harmony".

796
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:52,037
Really? I've been putting "Bayberry"
with "Tahitian Sunrise".

797
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,682
- That I like. That's Zen.
- Yeah.

798
00:45:54,705 --> 00:45:57,719
You know what I like? I like how
you put the batball right in the center.

799
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,282
I like that so much that I'm gonna
see you ball and raise you another ball.

800
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:02,987
That's a good idea.
We should definetely have 2 balls...

801
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:04,880
- Yeah. Do another ball.
- Hey, Dennis...

802
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,717
Come and curl some ribbon.

803
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:09,957
I can feel my sperm dying inside
of me, one at a time.

804
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,931
Shut up and grab a basket.
Come on, it's fun.

805
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:14,086
I'm going to a strip club
to eat some meat.

806
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:15,847
Then I'm gonna get into a fight.

807
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:18,476
Call me when you find your
balls, Tom.

808
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:19,445
Alright, tuff guy.

809
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,590
Or maybe they're in the basket,
next to the "Tahitian Sunrise".

810
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:26,309
Someone's afraid of his
feminin side...

811
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,327
Look at that... Nice job
with the fluffing.

812
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:29,913
Look at that.

813
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:31,902
- Perfect. Perfect.
- What is that, my friends.

814
00:46:31,903 --> 00:46:33,204
- Look at us.
- Come on.

815
00:46:33,205 --> 00:46:34,555
- Can't loose.
- Good work, huh?

816
00:46:38,202 --> 00:46:39,787
Hello ladies.
You look lovely today.

817
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,731
- Tom!
- Oh, Hillary. How are you?

818
00:46:42,732 --> 00:46:45,240
Good. Everything looks wonderful.

819
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:46,833
This is the best shower
I've ever been to.

820
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,075
Really? You think so?

821
00:46:48,076 --> 00:46:50,145
You know what, Hillary?
You should really eat something.

822
00:46:50,146 --> 00:46:52,447
No, Tom. I'm fine.

823
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,915
Fine. I'm okay.

824
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:00,398
What you ladies would go
through to fit in to a dress...

825
00:47:00,856 --> 00:47:04,527
This pretty much blows your rule out of
the water about no women allowed at your place.

826
00:47:04,528 --> 00:47:06,042
What good is a rule if you
don't break it every now and then?

827
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:08,526
I'm very, very impressed
Thank you.

828
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:10,309
Listen to that.

829
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:12,660
Gay Gordon's party remix,
just for you.

830
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,099
Hear the horn.

831
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,595
- It's good isn't it?
- No.

832
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:20,612
Let me turn it up there...
It's...

833
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:22,196
- It's a little loud...
- What?

834
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:25,166
- It's a little loud!
- Okay. There you go.

835
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:27,075
Look at this. Try this.
Haggis pink.

836
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:32,143
It's pepper, cheese, chopped up baby
lam lung, and cow petuitary gland.

837
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:32,975
- How are you?
- ...

838
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:36,120
It's a Scottish delicacy.
Colin recomended it.

839
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,238
Ladies, ladies.
Look...

840
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:42,628
What just came,
for Hannah.

841
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:46,009
It's from Colin, everyone.

842
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:50,127
Oh wait. There's a card.
There's a card, a card...

843
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:51,478
For: "Hannah".

844
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:57,089
"Hannah, my love, this is the ekstremely
rare Scottish floral budwissel".

845
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,091
This?

846
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:01,174
"They only bloom for 4 hours
before they die".

847
00:48:01,175 --> 00:48:04,132
He must have timed this out
perfectly...

848
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:07,133
Oh my gosh, when we first met,
Colin promised that he would rome

849
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,896
at the countryside to
find me one, and he did.

850
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:14,242
Sweetheart, that's the must romantic
thing I ever heard.

851
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:15,525
Thanks mom.

852
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,527
Joan, good to see you.
It's been too long.

853
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,409
Easter, wasn't it?

854
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,431
Yes. You slept with
our maid.

855
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,535
She told you?
I didn't know she spoke English.

856
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:25,563
Yes...

857
00:48:25,564 --> 00:48:27,596
This is grandmom Pearl.
You remember Tom?

858
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:31,364
- How are you?
- Oh, yes, the fornicator.

859
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:33,889
That's right.

860
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:37,239
- Okay...
- Tom, this is awsome.

861
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,176
- It's great.
- Good. Thank you.

862
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:40,786
This is even better than
my sister's shower.

863
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:41,997
- Oh, really?
- Ahem...

864
00:48:41,998 --> 00:48:43,109
Everything seems to
be doing well. Yes?

865
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,646
Sharon would like to know
where to set up.

866
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:46,826
- Who?
- The entertainment...

867
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:51,028
Ah, yes... I mean good.
She should set up over there.

868
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:55,302
Hello everybody. Hi, I'm Sharon.
Good to see you all.

869
00:48:55,303 --> 00:48:56,879
Yeah, come on, right
down the front.

870
00:48:57,628 --> 00:48:59,457
This was my idea, you know?

871
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,864
I know how much you loved her from
Stephanie's sister's shower...

872
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:04,347
Before we start, I would like for us
all to take in a deep breath...

873
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:05,811
She wasn't at
the shower...

874
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:08,118
- She wasn't?
- No.

875
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,329
- And now exhale slowly...
- Really?

876
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,816
Good job.

877
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:13,665
It's very important to
reset our third eye.

878
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:17,508
And connect to
the primal inside of ourselves,

879
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:19,683
Before I present the
pleasuries.

880
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:21,177
Pleasureries?

881
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:22,469
Now...

882
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,694
These pleasuries are best used when
in tantric meditative state.

883
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:32,785
And today, I'm going to show you ladies
how to reach your optimal sacrel Chakra.

884
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:35,121
All of these aids are
for sale, ladies.

885
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:39,423
And look what we have here...
Eatable panties.

886
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:41,491
You look hungry.
Try to snack on these.

887
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,143
There you go.

888
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,807
Now ladies, what pleasure
party would be complete without...

889
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:49,694
Glow-in-the-dark thunderbeets?

890
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,500
These are terrific.
And for you ladies, today...

891
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:52,852
Two for one.

892
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:54,397
Okay?

893
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,355
There you go.
Wanna try this out, princess?

894
00:49:57,803 --> 00:49:59,777
Where do these go?

895
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:06,018
From casual writing to evening wear.
Gorgeous!

896
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,933
Why don't you keep those?

897
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:10,614
And they match your
ear rings.

898
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,029
Hannah, are you okay?

899
00:50:25,582 --> 00:50:27,321
You know that I've dreamt
of my wedding shower,

900
00:50:27,322 --> 00:50:28,912
ever since I was
10 years old?

901
00:50:28,913 --> 00:50:29,913
No...

902
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:32,716
Strangely enough, the image
of my grandmom, pearldrape

903
00:50:32,717 --> 00:50:34,724
and glow-in-the-dark thunderbeets
wasn't part of it.

904
00:50:34,725 --> 00:50:36,244
It's not funny, Tom.

905
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:40,178
Do you have any idea how
important this is to me?

906
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:44,727
The Gay Gordon, pink Haggis,
Dildo-sales woman?

907
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,236
Just understand something,
Melissa set me up.

908
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:50,169
Oh please! There's always
an excuse with you.

909
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:53,608
I never even should have asked
you to do this in the first place.

910
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:55,222
You don't even believe in marriage
for Christ sake...

911
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:57,015
You know, I might.

912
00:50:59,963 --> 00:51:01,357
I gotta get back.

913
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:15,582
Melissa's pretty good.

914
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,862
Look, the whole goal here was to
convince Hannah that I've grown up,

915
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:21,024
and that she doesn't know
anything about Colin...

916
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:23,362
That I'm the right
man for her.

917
00:51:24,154 --> 00:51:25,787
That did not happen.

918
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:29,894
Stella. No, baby.
Don't eat buttons, okay?

919
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:32,447
Yeah, but your still
the Maid of Honor, right Tom?

920
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,546
I don't know. I think she
might have fired me.

921
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:36,692
How does somebody
get fired from being Maid of Honor?

922
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,043
Tell me about it.

923
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,313
- You know what? I got an idea.
- Okay.

924
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,185
To prove to Hannah that
you're the only man for her,

925
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,280
we have to make you the best
Made of Honor, ever.

926
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,631
Right.

927
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,665
- I'm out of loss. Completely stunned.
- Great.

928
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,087
My guy couldn't find any
dirt on Colin.

929
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:51,022
This has never happened.
This guy's clean.

930
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:51,865
Glad that happened to me.

931
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:53,556
You know, he's got
3 Guinness world records?

932
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,216
- Cool!
- We don't need to know that...

933
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:57,005
He's actually got a Medal of Honor.

934
00:51:57,006 --> 00:52:00,133
That's funny, because we
got the Made of Honor!

935
00:52:02,105 --> 00:52:03,367
Let's stay focused.

936
00:52:03,368 --> 00:52:05,904
Look, the point is, we're not gonna
get her off this guy.

937
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:08,067
Yeah, so we need to make
this not about Colin.

938
00:52:08,068 --> 00:52:09,485
Yeah, we need to
make it about you.

939
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:10,850
- Good...
- You gotta show her

940
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,367
That you're growing up...
- Finally...

941
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:14,277
I am changing.
I am growing up.

942
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:16,360
- Good!. Then this should be easy for you.
- Great...

943
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:19,865
These are bridal magazines from
18 different countries...

944
00:52:19,866 --> 00:52:22,720
each with a feature article on
the duties of being the Maid of Honor.

945
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:24,578
Perfect! "Über Bride"...

946
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:28,659
I got these guys in Bangdelur that we're
outsource to, they translated them over night.

947
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,952
- Great.
- Nice "aperitizers" there, Gary...

948
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,693
- Here's the "Main course"
- What have you got for me?

949
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:36,144
My wife Deb is a A-type personality,
she ahs to do everything perfect.

950
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:37,309
- Sure...
- Love her...

951
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,310
- Hate that about her.
- Right.

952
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:41,429
Anyway, she rented this when
she was gonna be the Maid Of Honor

953
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,220
for her yoga teacher.

954
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:44,571
This is "the goods".
You're gonna be wow-ed.

955
00:52:47,545 --> 00:52:49,145
12 STEPS DOWN THE ALTAR

956
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,700
Hi, I'm Elisabeth Hasselbeck
and I'm just so thrilled

957
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:58,251
you've purchased this program.

958
00:52:58,252 --> 00:52:59,253
And I'm proud of you...

959
00:52:59,254 --> 00:53:01,501
Because it shows that
you're not happy being just

960
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,375
an ordinary friend and loved one.

961
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:08,661
No. You and I are gonna work together
to make you the perfect Maid of Honor.

962
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:11,696
When we're through, you'll know
everything there is to know about dresses,

963
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:15,153
Crockery, nuptial eticette
and pleasing your bride.

964
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:17,510
What's the length...
of the bridesmaid dress?

965
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:18,688
No longer than the brides.

966
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:21,026
What if you know someone
won't be able to attend the wedding?

967
00:53:21,027 --> 00:53:22,565
You got to send an
invitation anyway.

968
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:24,124
Recieving line?

969
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:26,126
Recieving line?

970
00:53:26,747 --> 00:53:29,210
If there's a recieving line, it means I've failed,
because Hannah's married.

971
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:31,174
Right. It was a trick question.

972
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:33,248
Who was the runner up MVP in 1974?

973
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:34,941
No, these questions all have
to do with Tom

974
00:53:34,942 --> 00:53:36,931
being the best Maid Of Honor
he can be.

975
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:38,282
Alright.

976
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,874
I thought we were just
asking like... Questions.

977
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,540
Go sit down.

978
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:44,549
Basic duties of the
Maid of Honor?

979
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,538
Manage the bridesmaids,
carry the ring, and support the bride.

980
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:49,791
Basic duties as You as
the Maid of Honor?

981
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:52,918
Show Hannah that I've matured,
that I can take care of my reponsibilties fully...

982
00:53:52,919 --> 00:53:54,808
and that I need to destroy
the wedding from within.

983
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:57,856
- What happens if you fail at that task?
- Colin gets her.

984
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,326
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride!

985
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:02,091
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride!

986
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:04,388
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride!

987
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:06,159
Steal the bride!

988
00:54:06,503 --> 00:54:07,924
And remember...

989
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:10,986
Weather it is helping with the seating chart
or giving your opinion on the cake,

990
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:15,580
the perfect Maid Of Honor is
with her bride every step of the way.

991
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:17,977
You didn't have to clear your
whole day to do all this.

992
00:54:17,978 --> 00:54:19,574
Are you kidding?
Off course I did.

993
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:22,570
The perfect Maid of Honor is
with his bride every step of the way.

994
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:24,322
A changed man...

995
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:25,787
I am indeed.

996
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,749
I don't even know where to begin.

997
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,073
When choosing a china
pattern,

998
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:33,907
you need to think about what type
of entertaining you're open to, foods you wanna cook...

999
00:54:36,635 --> 00:54:40,373
Look. Now don't be afraid
to mix and mash.

1000
00:54:40,374 --> 00:54:42,977
It's important, even with
different styles and textures.

1001
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:45,443
What you wanna do, is stur
up the tabel.

1002
00:54:45,444 --> 00:54:49,519
Make it come alive with color
and tenasity. That's the goal.

1003
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,865
Also, at the end of the day...
You will find...

1004
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:55,797
...Connections.

1005
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:58,054
Thank you very much.

1006
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,039
Let's go.

1007
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,681
If you think I'm good with plates,
wait till you see what I do with linnens.

1008
00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:05,675
- Lingerie, perfect.
- What about the linnens?

1009
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,529
You'll be able to pick out
something for the wedding night.

1010
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,278
- No!
- Are you crazy? You're the perfect person for this job.

1011
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:13,250
Who's taken off more lingerie
than you?

1012
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:15,727
let's put your "whore-ing"
to good use.

1013
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,563
Good point.

1014
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:23,267
So how did it go with the
Scottish Grand Counsil?

1015
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,932
Great. Colin got them to
approve everything.

1016
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:28,283
Great.

1017
00:55:30,252 --> 00:55:33,430
So, I gotta tell you...
This is gonna sound funny, but...

1018
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,639
- I have to thank you.
- For what?

1019
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,618
For asking me to be your
Maid of Honor.

1020
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:42,424
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

1021
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:47,090
You've really opened my eyes,
to the whole idea of marriage.

1022
00:55:47,091 --> 00:55:49,332
- Yeah, right...
- No, seriously...

1023
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:53,765
- Have you met someone, Tom?
- No.

1024
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:56,022
Then how can you
be serious?

1025
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:59,011
I don't know, I just...

1026
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:05,714
I don't know.

1027
00:56:23,571 --> 00:56:24,922
What do you think?

1028
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:26,775
Think Colin will like it?

1029
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:31,925
No... no.

1030
00:56:31,926 --> 00:56:33,455
- What?
- It's just...

1031
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:36,636
It's cute.

1032
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:40,259
"Cute"? I do not wanna look
"cute" on my wedding night.

1033
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,861
Just put this on.
Cover yourself up.

1034
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:43,392
That's my coat.

1035
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:44,982
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Yeah.

1036
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:52,230
Here let me get you
in a cab. Come on.

1037
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:55,264
I can't believe this is my
last day in New York.

1038
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:56,808
What are you talking about?

1039
00:56:58,253 --> 00:57:00,269
I've been meaning to tell you, Tom.

1040
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,045
When I leave tomorrow,
I'm not coming back.

1041
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:07,919
I've decided to move to
Scotland, to be with Colin.

1042
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:10,185
- You're leaving New York?
- I am.

1043
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:14,923
It's exciting, you know?
It makes sence.

1044
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:17,868
He's next in line to take
over the family buissness...

1045
00:57:18,493 --> 00:57:20,352
It's a whole new chapter.

1046
00:57:25,226 --> 00:57:27,718
- You were amazing today, you know that?
- Oh, yeah?

1047
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:30,516
Yeah. I had no idea you could
juggle like that.

1048
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:32,635
- Yeah, well...
- I mean, women yes, china no.

1049
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:35,464
- Yeah, I know.
- You're always amzing.

1050
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:39,148
Come here.

1051
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:49,070
- See you in Scotland soon, okay?
- Yeah, see you over there.

1052
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:54,022
I'll miss you.

1053
00:58:02,124 --> 00:58:03,744
Scotland...

1054
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:14,628
Come, baby.

1055
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,264
He likes you.

1056
00:58:20,265 --> 00:58:21,626
- Hi.
- Hey.

1057
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,907
- Nice dogs.
- This is Hamish and this is Callum.

1058
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:27,988
- Callum?
- Yeah.

1059
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,435
What kind of dog is that?

1060
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:32,457
- He's a Scottie.
- A Scottie?

1061
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:37,409
That's perfect.
Fuckin Scottie...

1062
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:48,771
I've never felt like this before.

1063
00:58:49,116 --> 00:58:50,330
So hopeless.

1064
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:53,720
So, tell me again, why you
agreed to be the Maid of Honor?

1065
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:58,468
To be with her, make her happy.
Figure out some way to get her off of him.

1066
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,640
Maybe that was all wrong. Maybe he's
better for her than me.

1067
00:59:01,877 --> 00:59:03,820
He's scottish, he can dunk,
he's perfect.

1068
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:08,235
Nobody's perfect. But I tell you,
this whiskey comes damn close...

1069
00:59:08,236 --> 00:59:10,589
It was a gift from Colin.
He made it.

1070
00:59:11,203 --> 00:59:12,554
Swell.

1071
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:16,846
I can't go. I can't watch
Hannah marry this guy.

1072
00:59:17,748 --> 00:59:19,715
She's moving to Scotland,
I've lost her already.

1073
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:22,361
- Crap.
- "...Love something, set it free".

1074
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:25,337
Said by a pussy and used
by pussies ever since.

1075
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:30,375
- Casablanca. "Bogie" put's her on a plane.
- Pussy.

1076
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:32,875
- "Bogie"'s a pussy?
- Big pussy.

1077
00:59:33,865 --> 00:59:36,345
You know, I've only
truly been in love once.

1078
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,509
Most amazing woman in the world.
She was my best friend.

1079
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:44,542
But I was young, stupid,
and I messed it up.

1080
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:48,256
In my great list of mistakes,
that was the greatest.

1081
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:50,708
- Who was this?
- Your mother.

1082
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:56,638
When I finally found out how stupid
I was and I decided to fight for it...

1083
00:59:57,069 --> 00:59:58,774
I was too late.

1084
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,135
She wouldn't take me back.

1085
01:00:02,482 --> 01:00:03,881
She was right.

1086
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,006
And then it really
was too late.

1087
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:19,344
By the way...
I'm getting another divorce.

1088
01:00:23,551 --> 01:00:25,313
Dad...

1089
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:32,447
Hey... Go an get her,
you pussy.

1090
01:00:35,658 --> 01:00:38,358
- What about the dresses?
- UPS are delivering them tomorrow morning.

1091
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:40,647
- I gave you the tracking adress...
- I got it.

1092
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:45,480
So, Colin and Hannah are gonna
meet everyone at the house...

1093
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:46,831
- Okay.
- Great.

1094
01:00:47,786 --> 01:00:49,097
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

1095
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:50,559
Go get 'em, Maid of Honor.

1096
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,458
- Yeah.
- Make this the perfect wedding.

1097
01:00:53,872 --> 01:00:57,123
- And steal the bride.
- Thanks, guys. Thanks.

1098
01:00:57,158 --> 01:00:59,464
Thanks for everything, man.
Thank you so much, alright?

1099
01:00:59,465 --> 01:01:02,419
- Alright, baby.
- Alright. Alright, alright. Get out of here.

1100
01:01:02,886 --> 01:01:04,236
I'll see you later.

1101
01:01:11,762 --> 01:01:15,987
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Hannah is SO lucky.

1102
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:18,093
- I know.
- I wish I was her.

1103
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:21,535
- How has she ever found such a great guy?
- We'll come visit her.

1104
01:01:21,536 --> 01:01:23,326
- I know...
- Look at the time.

1105
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:53,157
What's your name?

1106
01:01:53,158 --> 01:01:56,012
You're a pretty dog.
I love you.

1107
01:02:03,425 --> 01:02:06,399
- That's his house?
- No, isn't this the summer house?

1108
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,793
The McMurray's have homes for each
season. This summer home, is their smallest.

1109
01:02:10,948 --> 01:02:13,498
They also have an Autumn home,
a Winter home, a Spring...

1110
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:15,320
I know the seasons,
thanks, buddy.

1111
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:16,733
Somebody's richer
than you, Tom.

1112
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:19,489
I guess you are gonna have to
invent something even stupider.

1113
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:42,245
Oh, my God!

1114
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:51,684
The entire castle was actually build
in 1220...

1115
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:55,444
- This is incredible, isn't it?
- Yes...Wow...

1116
01:02:56,321 --> 01:03:01,272
Grandma Pearl, Joan, this is
my mother, Diedre and my father, Mungo.

1117
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:05,746
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1118
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:07,087
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you, Joan. Pleasure.

1119
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:08,590
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

1120
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:11,326
Everyone, I want you to meet someone
who is so special to my Hannah

1121
01:03:11,327 --> 01:03:16,105
and who has been her life-long friend,
and now her Maid of Honor, Tom.

1122
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:19,883
- Hi, how is...
- Did he just say he's the Maid of Honor...

1123
01:03:19,884 --> 01:03:20,979
He's a bloke?!

1124
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,646
- How do you do?
- Very good, thank you.

1125
01:03:22,778 --> 01:03:24,269
- Mungo.
- Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.

1126
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,496
Definitely gay.

1127
01:03:26,497 --> 01:03:30,862
And these are the bridesmaids.
Hillary, Stephanie and Melissa.

1128
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:33,044
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1129
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:35,357
- Hi.
- Nice that you could come. How do you do?

1130
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:38,653
How do you do?

1131
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,804
- So... what do you think?
- I think, they think I'm gay.

1132
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:46,812
Look can we get together,
talk, catch up?

1133
01:03:46,813 --> 01:03:49,224
- Tom, do wanna see your chamber?
- Love to.

1134
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,576
- Okay, follow me
- Thank you.

1135
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:03,307
Thank you.

1136
01:04:04,114 --> 01:04:05,464
Thank you!

1137
01:04:06,213 --> 01:04:10,873
Now then... I think just a few more
spricks of jipsoffle at the front there...

1138
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:12,999
Lovely.

1139
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:16,830
- What do you guys think?
- Oh!. It is gorgeous...

1140
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:20,002
- It is so pretty... With the vail...
- So shiny, and the volume...

1141
01:04:20,003 --> 01:04:21,706
Tom... What do you think?

1142
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:27,171
Of...?
The hair! Yeah, it...

1143
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:30,403
This sash will go on the dress.

1144
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:33,706
- Really?
- Tradition!

1145
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:37,611
What's up with that?

1146
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:38,778
Well...

1147
01:04:38,779 --> 01:04:41,674
I'm not.. entirely sure...

1148
01:04:41,675 --> 01:04:44,078
Oh no, you see...
It's attached up here...

1149
01:04:44,243 --> 01:04:47,479
Tom, you're the Maid of Honor,
it's good to just be supportive...

1150
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,400
- I'm supportive.
- I don't think you are.

1151
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:50,810
- No, I am.
- Listen to me...

1152
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:52,916
You're doing good, you're good...

1153
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:54,473
Hannah...

1154
01:04:54,844 --> 01:04:58,499
Actually, your hair...
Looks amazing.

1155
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:00,545
- Really?
- Yes.

1156
01:05:01,802 --> 01:05:04,954
The games will be starting soon.
Here are your costumes.

1157
01:05:04,955 --> 01:05:07,160
- Games?
- Costumes!

1158
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:09,407
- Our costumes?
- What do you mean, games?

1159
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:10,806
The Highland games.

1160
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:13,466
It's a tradtion,
in honor of the wedding.

1161
01:05:13,467 --> 01:05:15,926
It goes right back to the time
when the groom had to prove

1162
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:18,296
that he was man enough to
deserve the bride.

1163
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,823
If he didn't win, he
didn't get the bride.

1164
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:23,452
No problem
for my Colin...

1165
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:31,116
Welcome, one an all
to the Highland Games.

1166
01:05:31,922 --> 01:05:34,980
Men have travelled from all four
corners of this great country

1167
01:05:34,981 --> 01:05:37,883
to compete in feets of
strenght and agility.

1168
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:41,542
But only one warrior will be
man enough to claim the bride.

1169
01:05:44,294 --> 01:05:49,141
One warrior that needs no introduction
is our very own Colin McMurray.

1170
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:51,526
- Isn't Colin handsome?
- And coming up,

1171
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:56,876
here, all the way from America,
Hannah's Maid of Honor, Tom.

1172
01:05:57,942 --> 01:06:01,933
Who I think you can all agree,
is wearing a rather fetching mini-kilt.

1173
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,652
- Who was in charge of that?
- I have no idea.

1174
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,059
They're really giving their all.

1175
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:36,999
And we're running neck and neck...
A Scottishman against a Yank.

1176
01:06:37,635 --> 01:06:38,986
Ladies and gentlemen,

1177
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:43,895
the result of today's Highland Games
rests upon the "Cable Toss".

1178
01:06:43,896 --> 01:06:46,820
The competition is down to
2 competetors.

1179
01:06:46,821 --> 01:06:49,243
A tree...
We're tossing a tree?

1180
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:54,651
What a toss!

1181
01:06:55,962 --> 01:06:57,858
Way to go, Colin!

1182
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:00,975
Okay, Tom. Let's see
what you're made of!

1183
01:07:01,453 --> 01:07:04,531
The whole competition rests
on this throw.

1184
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:07,382
Look at that Yanksie!.

1185
01:07:07,392 --> 01:07:09,089
Alright. Okay..

1186
01:07:10,933 --> 01:07:13,545
Come on, Tom!
Oh gosh...

1187
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,306
Okay. I can do this.
I can do this. Okay.

1188
01:07:16,307 --> 01:07:18,147
Here we go. Great.

1189
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,061
Okay. Okay.

1190
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:22,771
Here we go. Here we go.

1191
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,122
Here we go, Oh...

1192
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:27,399
Watch out, watch out.

1193
01:07:42,928 --> 01:07:46,607
That's gonna cost the Yank
the gold medal.

1194
01:07:48,185 --> 01:07:51,991
- What an ass!
- And the winner of the Highland Games is,

1195
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:54,661
our very own Colin McMurray!

1196
01:08:05,158 --> 01:08:06,509
That's great.

1197
01:08:07,491 --> 01:08:11,777
*For my love is like a melody*

1198
01:08:11,778 --> 01:08:14,680
*That sweetly played in June*

1199
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:18,759
*As fair are thou, my bunnylass*

1200
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,046
*say deep in love am I*

1201
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:27,688
*And I will love thee still, my dear*

1202
01:08:27,723 --> 01:08:31,235
*till all the seas gang dry*

1203
01:08:32,449 --> 01:08:37,612
*And I will love thee still,
My dear*

1204
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:43,020
*Though'd were a thousand miles*.

1205
01:08:46,495 --> 01:08:47,941
Well done, My boy.

1206
01:08:47,942 --> 01:08:49,292
Well done!

1207
01:08:51,822 --> 01:08:53,172
That was so...!

1208
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:54,799
Well done, my boy.

1209
01:09:03,204 --> 01:09:07,555
Robert Burns, who wrote that song,
is Scotland's most famous poet.

1210
01:09:10,908 --> 01:09:14,662
No, no, auntie. We haven't had any "berns" yet,
so we haven't got any names yet.

1211
01:09:14,663 --> 01:09:16,223
"Berns" means children.

1212
01:09:16,224 --> 01:09:19,398
I'm so sorry, I'm having a hard
time understanding your accent.

1213
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:21,892
- "Ethel".
- Excuse me?

1214
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,585
It's a name, for the children.

1215
01:09:24,668 --> 01:09:26,641
- "Ethel".
- "Ethel"...

1216
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:29,530
Little Ethel.

1217
01:09:30,973 --> 01:09:34,252
Yeah. We won't be naming our
child Ethel.

1218
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:36,634
Maybe if he was a teenager...

1219
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:38,991
My mother's third cousin was
the Duke of Ethel.

1220
01:09:38,992 --> 01:09:41,724
We're a long line
of "Ethels".

1221
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:45,703
Maybe... Maybe we'll keep
it in the mix, maybe as a middle name...

1222
01:09:58,706 --> 01:10:02,255
- So, Hannah, do you like the vensen?
- It's delicious.

1223
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:06,122
Colin shot it.
He's a wonderful Shot.

1224
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:10,307
- Stop, mum. You'll make me blush.
- And this is the moment. I've just remembered.

1225
01:10:10,787 --> 01:10:13,891
- What moment is that?
- When Colin killed the deer.

1226
01:10:13,892 --> 01:10:15,830
I filmed it.

1227
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:20,939
Right between the eyes.

1228
01:10:23,058 --> 01:10:27,423
In fact, everything we are eating
this evening, Colin has killed.

1229
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:30,353
- To Colin!
- To Colin.

1230
01:10:30,516 --> 01:10:32,067
In your honor, Hannah.

1231
01:10:33,082 --> 01:10:34,902
That is so thoughtful...

1232
01:10:35,276 --> 01:10:37,884
I'm so sorry, I didn't kill
anything for you...

1233
01:10:44,985 --> 01:10:47,380
Gosh...
What did you get?

1234
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:49,926
- Uhm...
- I love chocolate!

1235
01:10:49,927 --> 01:10:52,227
Don't... Don't do that.

1236
01:10:52,988 --> 01:10:54,707
You want some...

1237
01:10:56,262 --> 01:10:58,190
Here. I'll give you some.

1238
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:10,981
Excuse me.
Reverend...

1239
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:16,834
Excuse me, sir. There you go.
Wonderful dinner, by the way.

1240
01:11:16,835 --> 01:11:18,794
- Delighted, Tom.
- And your wife is beautiful.

1241
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:20,179
Thank you very much.

1242
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:22,651
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

1243
01:11:24,771 --> 01:11:28,131
A little birdy tells me that Colin personally
slayed each one of these reindeer heads...

1244
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:31,068
- Tom...
- Alright.

1245
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:33,766
I say "a little birdy told me",
He would have told me, but Colin shot it.

1246
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,504
Listen, seriously...

1247
01:11:37,095 --> 01:11:40,013
Can we go somewhere private
and talk? It's important.

1248
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:43,492
- Yeah.
- Should we go?

1249
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:48,174
Bagpipes...

1250
01:11:49,845 --> 01:11:52,082
Oh, My God...

1251
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:57,614
He's been playing the bag pipes ever since
he was 3 years old. Practices every night.

1252
01:11:58,018 --> 01:12:00,461
- Every night?
- Never misses!

1253
01:12:03,727 --> 01:12:08,304
- What kind of necklace is that?
- They're glow-in-the-dark thunderbeets.

1254
01:12:21,183 --> 01:12:24,455
- Hi, mom.
- I have something for you.

1255
01:12:27,752 --> 01:12:30,715
- Some evening, huh?
- Yes...

1256
01:12:32,838 --> 01:12:35,738
This is so you can have a little
piece of home with you.

1257
01:12:36,128 --> 01:12:37,515
Thank you.

1258
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,947
Look at you...

1259
01:12:43,543 --> 01:12:47,504
There's you and Melissa.
You were about 5 there.

1260
01:12:50,404 --> 01:12:51,791
Do you remember this?

1261
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:57,197
It was taken at the lake, when you father
broke his arm, because of that silly motorcycle of his.

1262
01:12:57,918 --> 01:13:01,605
- I miss dad so much
- Me too, Sweetheart.

1263
01:13:01,606 --> 01:13:03,789
I just wish that he could
have been here.

1264
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:07,045
He was always so worried,
I was never gonna meet anyone.

1265
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:10,226
- No, he wasn't.
- That's Paris.

1266
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:12,500
He could be so "off days" sometimes...

1267
01:13:12,696 --> 01:13:14,126
What?

1268
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:18,909
Well, it's just... He was always convinced
that you were gonna marry Tom.

1269
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:21,576
Really?

1270
01:13:24,444 --> 01:13:28,130
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night, My Angel.

1271
01:13:30,735 --> 01:13:34,456
It's pulling off a bandaid.
You just have to close your eyes and do it.

1272
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:39,225
- I just haven't found the right time.
- What are you talking about, "right time"?

1273
01:13:39,693 --> 01:13:43,622
Anytime is the right time to say
"I love you, marry me".

1274
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:46,451
- Right.
- Come on, what are you there for, man?

1275
01:13:46,892 --> 01:13:49,837
Take the shot, win the game
and bring her home!

1276
01:13:50,194 --> 01:13:53,268
And stop running up my long-distance
phone bill with these crazy calls!.

1277
01:13:53,269 --> 01:13:56,450
Right, right okay.
Thanks, Felix.

1278
01:13:57,564 --> 01:14:02,367
God, come on. You can do this, Tom.
What's wrong with me? You can do this.

1279
01:14:14,246 --> 01:14:15,239
- Hey.
- Hey!

1280
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,589
I thought we could go for a
walk and work on the vowes.

1281
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:21,713
- Good idea. I need some help.
- Good. Okay.

1282
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,165
- What do you think?
- I think a lot of things.

1283
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:29,714
I've been working on them all week
and I actually think they're getting worse.

1284
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:33,145
At first I went for the "emotion",
I thought: "What if Colin does it"?

1285
01:14:33,146 --> 01:14:34,604
Then I tried to be funny...

1286
01:14:34,605 --> 01:14:37,125
I don't know if Scots have the same
sence of humor as americans.

1287
01:14:37,126 --> 01:14:40,653
So now I am back to something basic
and I totally think I've geared off into something boring...

1288
01:14:40,654 --> 01:14:41,593
I'm crazy about you.

1289
01:14:41,594 --> 01:14:45,672
I think of you all the time and
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

1290
01:14:45,673 --> 01:14:47,024
Really?

1291
01:14:47,468 --> 01:14:48,738
Really.

1292
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:51,113
- That's so "generic".
- Generic?

1293
01:14:51,114 --> 01:14:52,979
- Yeah!
- Generic?

1294
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,670
- It totally is!
- How can that be generic?

1295
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:58,566
It sounds like something you're supposed
to say instead of what your really feeling.

1296
01:15:02,218 --> 01:15:04,059
Alright. How about...

1297
01:15:07,345 --> 01:15:10,777
Nobody in the world makes
me laugh the way you do.

1298
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,881
You're my best friend.

1299
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,188
I just wanna be with you.

1300
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:24,036
Look, look!
There she is!

1301
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:27,581
Let's go, let's go!

1302
01:15:27,582 --> 01:15:30,403
- Hannah, let's go!
- What is this?

1303
01:15:30,845 --> 01:15:32,443
- It's her "taking out".
- Her... What?

1304
01:15:33,059 --> 01:15:35,797
We dress her up and then we
parade around one of the pubs in town.

1305
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:37,475
- That's wierd...
- It's tradition!

1306
01:15:37,476 --> 01:15:39,905
- Really?
- Then we fill a toilet with salt

1307
01:15:39,906 --> 01:15:42,244
and we sell your kisses
for change.

1308
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:45,539
- Sell your kisses?
- Yep.

1309
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:49,689
Come on, it's like a Scottish
Bachelorette-party.

1310
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:55,526
Okay, Okay...

1311
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:09,320
- Okay, come on!

1312
01:16:19,164 --> 01:16:23,013
Change for kisses!
Right there...

1313
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:25,879
Instead of Whiskeys.

1314
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:30,672
It's her "taking-out"!
She's got the breath of an angel.

1315
01:17:08,661 --> 01:17:12,283
One more, alright, alright.

1316
01:17:17,044 --> 01:17:18,825
- Another!
- Another!

1317
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:20,304
Thank you.

1318
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:25,715
This is all I have.

1319
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:13,023
- Oh, my God! My God, you guys!
- Let's go!

1320
01:18:13,472 --> 01:18:16,433
We have to get more kisses.

1321
01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:19,129
Kisses!

1322
01:19:20,752 --> 01:19:23,013
- I can't take it anymore!
- What are you doing?

1323
01:19:23,014 --> 01:19:24,043
- Let's do it again.
- No!

1324
01:19:24,044 --> 01:19:26,130
- For old time's sake...
- Don't take that off.

1325
01:19:26,131 --> 01:19:28,086
- I need to make this up to you...
- Don't... take... this.

1326
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:32,648
No, I'm really unhappy.

1327
01:19:32,649 --> 01:19:33,578
- That's fine.
- Tom...

1328
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:35,721
- It's okay. It's okay...
- I'm not happy at all.

1329
01:19:36,315 --> 01:19:38,340
- Get up...
- And I am in a really...

1330
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:41,868
confusing place in my life
right now...

1331
01:19:43,081 --> 01:19:44,601
- Confusing?
- Listen...

1332
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:47,414
- I have had some whiskey...
- I can tell.

1333
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:49,599
And I need you to "service" me.

1334
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,285
- "Service" you? I not gonna "service you"...
- "Service me", bitch!

1335
01:19:52,286 --> 01:19:53,636
- Oh, my...
"Service me"!

1336
01:19:53,938 --> 01:19:56,157
- Be quiet!
- You be quiet.

1337
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,207
Everyone's sleeping...

1338
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,173
- Get down.
- You can't get down.

1339
01:20:00,174 --> 01:20:01,114
You can't...

1340
01:20:01,115 --> 01:20:02,762
- Be quiet!
- You be quiet.

1341
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:06,778
No. No! Get off!

1342
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,511
Wait... Wait...

1343
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:13,007
- Hannah...
- Bring me more whiskey.

1344
01:20:16,642 --> 01:20:17,992
Hannah.

1345
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:20,490
It's Tom, let me in.
Let me in.

1346
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:22,049
Go away, Tom.

1347
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,185
No. Let me explain.
It's not what you think.

1348
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,390
- It doesn't matter now.
- Yes it does. Why did you...

1349
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:29,281
- Just... Go!
- I'll go. Just tell me, why

1350
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:30,940
did you come to my room?

1351
01:20:33,522 --> 01:20:36,830
Hannah... Why did you
come to the room?

1352
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:39,231
To talk about that kiss.

1353
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:48,645
Please, don't...
Don't marry him.

1354
01:20:49,415 --> 01:20:51,601
- All these years, Tom...
- Don't marry him...

1355
01:20:52,053 --> 01:20:54,260
All this time...

1356
01:20:54,445 --> 01:20:57,599
- You're doing this now?
- I know...

1357
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,664
- How can you do this?
- I'm sorry... Just let me in.

1358
01:21:00,665 --> 01:21:03,874
- No. I can't.
- Let me in.

1359
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:06,869
You're only doing this now because
you are afraid of loosing me.

1360
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:13,399
I need someone who's gonna
be there for me,

1361
01:21:14,486 --> 01:21:16,579
no matter what happens.

1362
01:21:20,373 --> 01:21:23,959
Someone who truly...
Loves me.

1363
01:21:27,453 --> 01:21:29,494
Someone I can trust.

1364
01:21:36,509 --> 01:21:40,864
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow...
Tom.

1365
01:21:58,357 --> 01:22:00,523
I can't be your
Maid of Honor.

1366
01:22:02,096 --> 01:22:03,990
I can't give you away.

1367
01:22:11,984 --> 01:22:13,489
I'm sorry, Hannah.

1368
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,961
I'm sorry, you and Tom
had a fight.

1369
01:22:18,913 --> 01:22:20,624
I'm his best friend.

1370
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,671
He's just afraid of
loosing me.

1371
01:22:26,315 --> 01:22:28,989
- He'll get over it.
- Ay.

1372
01:22:57,428 --> 01:22:59,883
- Suck it! Suck it.
- I am!

1373
01:22:59,884 --> 01:23:02,018
- Okay. Suck it in. Breath in...

1374
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:05,081
- Hold it...
- I'm trying, my God..

1375
01:23:05,082 --> 01:23:07,261
- I'll hold it in.
- Okay. Alright, alright.

1376
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:11,895
- Give it to me..
- 1, 2, 3...

1377
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:16,242
- Is it?...
- Oh, My God!

1378
01:23:16,243 --> 01:23:17,976
- It fits, it fits!

1379
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:20,726
- It fits!
- Well done.

1380
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:23,946
- Oh no. No, no...
- My God... no...

1381
01:23:50,071 --> 01:23:52,635
- Why are we stopping?
- An early flock.

1382
01:23:52,636 --> 01:23:54,556
A... What?

1383
01:24:10,864 --> 01:24:12,678
Hi, Sweetheart.

1384
01:24:36,928 --> 01:24:38,480
I remember you.

1385
01:24:39,548 --> 01:24:40,898
Hey.

1386
01:24:42,019 --> 01:24:43,370
Hi.

1387
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,184
I love you too.

1388
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:55,622
Thank you.

1389
01:24:57,062 --> 01:24:59,496
Turn around,
I have to go back.

1390
01:25:24,816 --> 01:25:26,166
Oh, no.

1391
01:25:28,226 --> 01:25:32,132
Oh no.
Shit... Shit!

1392
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:35,320
- Hey, I need another ferry-boat.
- We only got the one ferry.

1393
01:25:35,321 --> 01:25:37,952
- What?
- And it's waiting over there for the ceremony to finish.

1394
01:25:38,928 --> 01:25:41,258
- Is there another way to get there?
- You can drive.

1395
01:25:41,259 --> 01:25:43,564
- Drive... How long?
- It will take about an hour and a half...

1396
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:45,094
- That's too long.
- You can swim.

1397
01:25:45,095 --> 01:25:47,389
- Swim?..
- Or you can go on trip around the shore.

1398
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:49,747
- That will take a wee while.
- Shore, right...

1399
01:25:51,603 --> 01:25:54,807
A horse! A horse.
Hey, I need your horse.

1400
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:56,209
- My horse?
- Yes.

1401
01:25:57,493 --> 01:25:59,828
- Come down from there.
- I need to get to the church.

1402
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:02,115
What do think you're planning, you
great fool? You'll hurt yourself.

1403
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:04,489
I'll give you 3 cents for
every coffee collar used world wide.

1404
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,240
- What?
- Do you have wny idea how much money that is?

1405
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,560
Good luck to you, then.
Her name's Nancy.

1406
01:26:08,561 --> 01:26:10,756
- I'll see you over there
- Thanks. Nancy, let's go!

1407
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:19,502
Stick to the shore... Pass the
monument, the church is on the left.

1408
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:24,934
What, in the name of the wee man,
is a "Coffee collar"?

1409
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:26,957
Go, Nancy!

1410
01:26:31,624 --> 01:26:35,023
This is just what
this nice dress needs...

1411
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:37,845
and it goes across the dress.
It looks really beautiful.

1412
01:27:01,997 --> 01:27:03,845
Please, be seated.

1413
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:08,753
We are gathered here together,
in the sight of God...

1414
01:27:08,754 --> 01:27:10,771
- Give me your pin...
- to witness this congregation...

1415
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:13,638
To join together this man...

1416
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:20,937
This is a celebration of love.

1417
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:24,493
For Colin, it's through the memories
of seeing his parent's love.

1418
01:27:24,494 --> 01:27:26,300
- ...As a child.
- It looks very nice.

1419
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:31,056
And for Hannah, it's
through the paintings of Modigliani.

1420
01:27:31,057 --> 01:27:36,511
Therefor, if any man can show just cause
why these two may not be joined together...

1421
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:40,070
Let him now speek,
or forever hold his peace.

1422
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,956
Tom?

1423
01:27:55,282 --> 01:27:56,632
Tom?

1424
01:27:57,139 --> 01:27:58,489
Tom!

1425
01:27:59,295 --> 01:28:01,910
Tom!
Tom?

1426
01:28:03,392 --> 01:28:04,743
Tom!

1427
01:28:06,004 --> 01:28:08,031
Tom...

1428
01:28:09,871 --> 01:28:11,129
Tom!

1429
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:13,351
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1430
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:17,621
- Tom, what are you doing here?
- I have to tell you something...

1431
01:28:18,286 --> 01:28:19,636
Hannah...

1432
01:28:22,348 --> 01:28:23,628
Your hair looks awful.

1433
01:28:23,629 --> 01:28:24,909
- It does?
- Yeah.

1434
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:26,416
- What?
- And the sash...

1435
01:28:27,855 --> 01:28:29,373
It sucks.

1436
01:28:31,263 --> 01:28:32,877
But that hair...

1437
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:36,745
-  It's like a co-op for para-keeds.
- What?

1438
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:40,105
Look... Hannah...

1439
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:43,160
I pride myself with being honest
with everybody.

1440
01:28:43,838 --> 01:28:48,388
But there's somebody I've been lying
to for a very long time. Myself.

1441
01:28:49,394 --> 01:28:53,093
Because the truth it's...
It's scary.

1442
01:28:53,772 --> 01:28:56,492
And 10 years ago I got in bed
with the wrong girl.

1443
01:28:57,551 --> 01:28:59,831
She turned out to be
the right one.

1444
01:29:06,403 --> 01:29:08,054
I love you, Hannah.

1445
01:29:09,022 --> 01:29:12,699
I always have...
And I always will.

1446
01:29:14,732 --> 01:29:16,140
Thomas Bailey...

1447
01:29:16,889 --> 01:29:20,589
You are the worst Maid
 of Honor of all time.

1448
01:29:45,599 --> 01:29:46,949
Oh, no.

1449
01:29:59,608 --> 01:30:00,958
I'm...

1450
01:30:01,493 --> 01:30:03,018
So...

1451
01:30:05,703 --> 01:30:07,813
Very, truly, sorry.

1452
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:16,491
I don't expect you to 
ever forgive me.

1453
01:30:20,926 --> 01:30:22,374
Just so you know...

1454
01:30:23,982 --> 01:30:26,195
You are the perfect guy.

1455
01:30:28,387 --> 01:30:30,836
Just not the perfect guy
for me.

1456
01:30:43,477 --> 01:30:45,139
Goodbye, Hannah.

1457
01:30:47,336 --> 01:30:48,687
Colin...

1458
01:30:53,192 --> 01:30:55,809
- What did she say?
- She said I should dick you.

1459
01:30:55,882 --> 01:30:57,523
Oh yeah, that makes sence...

1460
01:31:01,046 --> 01:31:02,471
Arsehole!

1461
01:31:16,962 --> 01:31:19,559
- I do.
- And Tom, do you take Hannah

1462
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,922
- to be your lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.

1463
01:31:23,547 --> 01:31:25,388
Now, this is the moment.

1464
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:31,592
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1465
01:31:31,593 --> 01:31:34,618
At last... You may kiss your bride.

1466
01:31:58,924 --> 01:32:00,461
Oh my God.

1467
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:02,768
- Number six?
- Seven.

1468
01:32:04,405 --> 01:32:07,747
You're absolutely glowing
tonight, grandma Pearl.

1469
01:32:07,748 --> 01:32:12,571
Thank you. It's very 
nice of you to say so.

1470
01:32:23,354 --> 01:32:24,704
What are you doing?

1471
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,802
I'm just making sure I got
the right girl this time.

1472
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:33,539
You do.
Definitely.

1473
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:42,754
- Oh, Monica...
- Oh, Bill...
