1
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,033
- You know they're all whores,
right?

2
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,766
Yeah.

3
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,966
All of 'em.

4
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,678
I'm not just talking
about the little skanks

5
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,476
that hang out around your dorm
or your frat or whatever,

6
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,985
but actually every woman
you've ever known

7
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:29,510
and every woman
you'll ever meet.

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,150
Mom, Grandma,
Aunt Ellen.

9
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,693
And the fact that
they're related to us

10
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,729
doesn't make a difference,

11
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,196
'cause at the end
of the day,

12
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,995
given the right
set of events,

13
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,628
they will fuck you over

14
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,970
for the sole reason that they
have a vagina and they can.

15
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,042
- Now, can I get you gentlemen
anything else?

16
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,084
- Coffee.

17
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,812
More coffee and, um,

18
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,217
I'd actually like
some cigarettes

19
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,413
if you happen to have them.

20
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,514
- We don't sell cigarettes
here, sir.

21
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,922
- Fine.

22
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,357
Coffee, then.

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,363
And this new one
of yours, Peter.

24
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,872
Jesus Christ.

25
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,339
I mean, you know,
you could have

26
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,137
at least preyed on
a couple high school girls,

27
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,268
get used to the thing.

28
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,609
And if they fuck you over,
well, it's not anything

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,707
that a night of heavy drinking
wouldn't take care of.

30
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,751
- She's a good girl, Caleb.

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,252
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,153
Tell me
where you met her again?

33
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,622
- No, don't do that.

34
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,556
- Do what?

35
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,594
- What you're doing.

36
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,128
Like you forgot already.

37
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,823
- No, I know where
you met her.

38
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,389
I just mean, you know,
give me all the details,

39
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,594
like we're getting our fucking
nails done or something.

40
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,432
What the hell
is the problem?

41
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,472
- How much further
do we have to go?

42
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,632
- I'm not paying
for your meal

43
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,140
unless you tell me
how you met her,

44
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,905
and I don't think they take
student loan checks in here.

45
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:06,112
Wow, that was fast.

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,710
Come on.

47
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,084
It would be
awful embarrassing,

48
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:13,683
two grown men, one of them
has to play dine and ditch.

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,026
Still waiting.

50
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,086
- I met her at the frat house.

51
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,996
- Yes, I know this part.

52
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,432
- She was
seeing a guy there,

53
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,764
and I ran into her
visiting him.

54
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,996
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,096
And what did the other boys
in the frat house

56
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,007
have to say
about you seeing her?

57
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,339
- How should I know?

58
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,812
- Well, I know, Peter,

59
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,441
and I was on your campus
for 45 minutes.

60
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,610
- She's a good girl.
She just has-

61
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,620
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
look, I'm just trying to prove

62
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,054
your dickhead roommate Pierre
wrong.

63
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,613
- Pierre said
something about Emma?

64
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,659
- Don't act surprised.

65
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,750
Pierre?

66
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,590
The kid's a fuckin' dick.

67
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,789
I could tell
before I shook his hand.

68
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,458
It smelled like
patchouli oil.

69
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,092
- If you're asking
if she has a reputation

70
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,000
for sleeping around
amongst those dickheads-

71
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,971
- Well, I guess she did cheat
on her boyfriend to be with you.

72
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,336
It's not a promising start.
- Okay.

73
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,374
You know what?

74
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,034
I'm really not even hungry.

75
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,305
And I told you
my stupid story,

76
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,812
so I'm gonna go wait
in the car.

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,279
- Wow.
- Give me the keys.

78
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,408
- Wow.
That's-that's rude.

79
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,452
- Yeah, well, you've been rude
since you picked me up,

80
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,486
so consider us even.

81
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,816
Please give me the keys,
Caleb.

82
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,185
- What do you want,
my keys?

83
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,849
I think they're in here
somewhere.

84
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,859
Ah, that's my lighter.

85
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,225
Oh, that's my dick.

86
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,060
You want to try and open my car
with my dick?

87
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,793
You know, squish it up
against the keyhole?

88
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,334
I don't think
that's gonna work at all.

89
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,494
Oh, here we go.

90
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,004
Check and see if they
have cigarettes next door?

91
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,872
- They're closed.

92
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,037
And they don't
sell cigarettes anyway.

93
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,944
- Well, thank you for that.

94
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,245
- Can I get you
anything else?

95
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,909
- Yeah,
you can warm this up,

96
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,213
and you can maybe
grab my check,

97
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,485
if you find the time in
your precious little schedule.

98
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,492
Fuckin' slut.

99
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,900
- # I had a long #

100
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,136
- Wrong keys, dickhead.

101
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:20,743
- # I had a long #

102
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:31,162
# I had a long,
long dream #

103
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:42,241
# I had a long dream
about swimmin' #

104
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,243
# Across the sea #

105
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,134
- Are you not sleeping again?

106
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,902
Caleb.

107
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,203
- Yeah?

108
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,369
What?

109
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,879
- How long has it been
since you slept?

110
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,438
- I don't know.

111
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,677
A week?

112
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,380
- How safe is it to drive
with you when you haven't slept?

113
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,888
- I'm not gonna lie
to you, Peter.

114
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,515
It's not that safe.

115
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,058
- Em!
- Hi!

116
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,098
God.

117
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,690
I thought I heard knocking,

118
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,029
and then I saw
your brother's car.

119
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,535
That's-is that your brother?
- Yeah, yeah.

120
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,538
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

121
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,774
I feel like I haven't seen
your face in forever.

122
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,869
- I know.

123
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,913
- Are your folks awake?

124
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,345
- Oh, God, no.

125
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,406
You know, they're probably
still drunk at this hour.

126
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,451
- Oh.

127
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,079
So should we-
should we go?

128
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,918
- Yeah, oh, can you help me
with that one?

129
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,957
- Oh, yeah.

130
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,322
I'll take this.

131
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,361
- Thanks.

132
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,859
- Caleb, this is
Emma Gainsborough.

133
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,598
- Hey.
- Hey, Caleb.

134
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,639
- Nice to meet you.

135
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,537
Emma.

136
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,166
Gosh, I've heard
so much about you,

137
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,108
I feel like you're famous.

138
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,848
- Okay.

139
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,611
Are you guys
gonna get in, or-?

140
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,550
- Yeah, I just thought
you two should meet

141
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,212
before we all
cram in your car.

142
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,848
- Well, I am so sorry,
your royal majesty.

143
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,290
Next time I'll-
I'll bring the rolls

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,453
so you can stretch out.

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,129
The fuck
is wrong with you?

146
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,794
- Do you want
the window seat?

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,565
'cause it might be
a little more comfortable

148
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,627
since you don't know him.

149
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,139
- Oh, no.
No, it's fine.

150
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,072
- I can, uh,
I can totally hear you.

151
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,837
FYl.

152
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,802
- I'm right here.

153
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,075
I'm, like,
four feet from you,

154
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,115
so if you want to-

155
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,616
oh, you're done chatting?

156
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,515
Okay, come on in.

157
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,553
- Hi-oh.

158
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,020
- This is tough.

159
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,387
You might want to-
just lifting the leg over is-

160
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,723
- Right.

161
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,888
- Wow, you're pretty good
at that.

162
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,934
Whoa!

163
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,973
Ready?

164
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,348
Sorry.

165
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,123
All right, one more,
one more.

166
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,159
Watch this.

167
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,990
Arrr!
Kgghh!

168
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,053
Sorry.

169
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,031
Oh!
- Sorry.

170
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,001
- That was-I usually
put my arm up.

171
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,664
- I thought we talked
about smoking in the car.

172
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,070
- Oh, no, no.
It's fine, honey.

173
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,904
- No, it's not, because
I know you don't like it,

174
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,035
and I specifically told you
not to smoke.

175
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,078
- Okay, okay, I got it.

176
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,137
Take it easy.

177
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,580
- Don't tell me
to take it easy.

178
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,642
- Your parents' home
is beautiful, by the way.

179
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,687
- Oh, thank you.

180
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,551
- Now, do you know
the architect,

181
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,022
by any chance?

182
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,388
- No, I don't.

183
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,121
My parents built it before
my sister and I were born.

184
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,355
- Oh, you have a sister?
- Yeah.

185
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,863
- I told you she had
an older sister.

186
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,058
- No, I don't think
you did, Peter.

187
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,159
The only thing you told me
was not to smoke in the car,

188
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,203
which I forgot.

189
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,238
My mistake.

190
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,637
But nothing about
an older sister,

191
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,675
as far as I remember.

192
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,300
- I told him.

193
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,605
- That's fine.
I don't care.

194
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,738
- Anyway, it's a lovely home,
and, uh...

195
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,009
- Thank you.

196
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,074
- And I would love to know
who built it sometime,

197
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,142
if you're ever talking
to your parents and remember.

198
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,278
- Oh, sure.
- Great.

199
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,755
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

200
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,916
I build homes.

201
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:26,959
I don't know if Peter-

202
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,425
he probably
mentioned that you.

203
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,461
- Oh, no, he didn't.

204
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,359
- Well, I didn't tell her that
because that's not true.

205
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,692
- I'm sorry?

206
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,357
- You're a construction worker.
- Uh-huh.

207
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,664
- Okay?
- Yeah, I construct homes.

208
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,500
See, the words "construct"
and "build"

209
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,698
are synonymous, Peter.

210
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,240
I don't know
if you don't know that

211
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,139
or if you just
are playing around.

212
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,370
- By asking about
the architect

213
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,706
and then immediately
thereafter

214
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,576
saying that you
build homes

215
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,172
implies that you were
an architect

216
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,216
which you are not.

217
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,716
- Uh-huh.

218
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,878
Okay.

219
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,750
- Are you gonna be joining us
for Thanksgiving, Caleb?

220
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,794
- No, no.

221
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,193
I'm afraid
this car ride

222
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,891
will be our only time
together, Emma.

223
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,627
Unless, of course,
Amtrak decides

224
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,726
to take every yahoo with a phone
seriously

225
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,327
when they call in
a fuckin' bomb threat.

226
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,100
- They'll be running again
by Sunday.

227
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,970
I already checked.
- Let's hope.

228
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,031
- Why won't you be joining us?

229
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,076
Are you working?

230
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,702
- No.

231
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,111
- Oh.

232
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,240
- My dad and I aren't
on the best of terms,

233
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,876
so that's all that is.

234
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,757
- I'm-I'm sorry.

235
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,791
- No, don't be.

236
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,818
It's not a big deal.

237
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,864
Okay, who's hungry?

238
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,832
I could use a cigarette.

239
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,003
- You're not gonna pull up
any further?

240
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,544
Okay.

241
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,784
Well, I guess
we'll be going, then.

242
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,848
- I got it.

243
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,300
Thank you, Caleb.

244
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,768
- Hmm, don't mention it.

245
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,305
- I think that's it.

246
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,365
Okay.

247
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,137
- Oh, hey, you guys,

248
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,771
if you need anything
while you're in town-

249
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
a ride,
you want to borrow some money,

250
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,950
a massage,

251
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,112
go ahead and ask that
fucking asshole Donald.

252
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,348
Okay?

253
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,582
- Thanks.

254
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,817
- Bye.

255
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,346
- Do you mind
if I move this stuff?

256
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,783
- Sure, yeah, that's fine.

257
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,912
Just keep chapter seven
on top.

258
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,148
- Chapter seven.

259
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,884
- Thanks.

260
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,091
- Hey, you weren't
kidding there, boy-o.

261
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,158
She's like a little angel.

262
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,397
Dark angel, really, which is
kind of sexier in a way.

263
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,134
- Dad, please, not everybody
is as deaf as you are, okay?

264
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,800
She'll hear you.

265
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,844
- So what?

266
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,173
You think
a young lady like that

267
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,840
doesn't like hearing
how goddamn gorgeous she is?

268
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,442
Shit, you gotta tell it
to 'em every ten minutes.

269
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,048
Boy, I bet she's a tiger
in bed, huh?

270
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,318
- Dad!

271
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,418
I really don't feel comfortable
with you asking me about that.

272
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,462
- All right.

273
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,587
Jesus, Peter.

274
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,598
When did you become
such a stick in the mud?

275
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,931
Jeez, you're like
my old man.

276
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,801
Hey, come on.

277
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,466
I'm just breaking your balls
a little bit.

278
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,907
Come here.

279
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,467
It's just 'cause I'm so damn
proud of you.

280
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,512
You know that, right?

281
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,706
- Yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

282
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,839
Just be nice to her, okay?

283
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,883
- Yeah.

284
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,043
- Leave the compliments
up to me, okay?

285
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,245
- I'll do my best.

286
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,379
- The table's set
if you guys are ready.

287
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,355
- We're sure ready
for you, darlin'.

288
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,690
No, Emma, I can't believe
for one minute

289
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,229
that your older sister
is half as pretty as you.

290
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,993
- Oh, I don't know,
Mr. Sinclaire.

291
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,033
She's awfully pretty.

292
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,796
- Please: Don, Donald,
Donny.

293
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,701
Anything
but Mr. Sinclaire, okay?

294
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,401
- Okay, sure.

295
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,773
- Does your sister dye her hair
jet black like that?

296
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,074
It's very flattering on you
with your-with the blue eyes.

297
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,047
- You know, Emma's at the top
of her class, dad.

298
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,810
- You don't say.
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,681
- What might you
be studying, Emma?

300
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,379
- I'm a psych major.

301
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,512
- Really?

302
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,055
So are we all
as fucked up as they say?

303
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,483
Um...

304
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,823
Uh, I don't know.

305
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,796
Actually, the only thing
we seem to be studying

306
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,195
is why men
hate their fathers

307
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,257
and want to sleep
with their mothers.

308
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,595
- This world needs
sharp women, Emma.

309
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,831
I swear to god,

310
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,737
every time I turn on
the television,

311
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,275
there's a woman
with something to say,

312
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,208
and I'll be damned
if I've seen one of them

313
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,008
I can listen to
for more than five minutes.

314
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,242
- Oh, thank you.

315
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,443
- You're welcome.

316
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,370
- I kn-

317
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,110
Hello.

318
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,514
Hello?

319
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,756
- I can hear you breathing,
Hannah.

320
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,387
I know what your breath
sounds like.

321
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,228
Why are you doing this?

322
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,571
- Either say something
or don't fuckin' call me, okay?

323
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,271
You're torturing me
with this.

324
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:04,213
You're fuckin'
torturing me.

325
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,792
Hey. Hey.

326
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,769
Look-look at the camera.

327
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,548
Thanks.

328
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,809
- Hey, Caleb.

329
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,972
Caleb!
- What?

330
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,982
- Why are you nailing
that hard?

331
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,679
Are we supposed to be nailing
harder with this one?

332
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,419
Hey, you ever watch
the Spanish channel

333
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,622
that's on your television?

334
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,494
- No.
- You should.

335
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,761
The girls
are wicked hot.

336
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,960
- You just discovered
boners?

337
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,731
Discovered, like,
what it is, what it means?

338
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,897
- No, actually
I was watching, uh,

339
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,806
that creep show girl,
Elvira, when I was little.

340
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,070
She had that long, dark hair?

341
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,202
- Elvira?

342
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,370
- Have you ever seen
her tits?

343
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,505
- Yeah.
And she's, like, 60.

344
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,210
- If you look at the pictures
of her when she was younger,

345
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,343
and I used to watch it,
and I used to think

346
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,320
that I wanted to be
in that show with her.

347
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,753
Like, we could be friends,
you know?

348
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,313
Like, she could take care
of me and stuff

349
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,483
and I could hang out
with her?

350
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,821
- That's quite a fantasy,
J.T.

351
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,452
- Just-can I tell you
the story?

352
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,590
- J.T., do you ever just think
about the shit you say

353
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,032
and-and think, uh,

354
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,865
"Wow, I should definitely
kill myself. "

355
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,804
Do you ever think that?

356
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,684
- Hey, Peter, you sure you don't
want to use my bowling shoes?

357
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:01,852
- Yes, Dad, I'm sure.

358
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,485
- What, is Andy Rooney
dressing you now?

359
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,697
- Right?

360
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,729
Come on, take the shoes.

361
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,530
They're just
sitting up there in a box.

362
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,332
- Yeah, well, maybe you
shouldn't have gotten

363
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,531
thrown out of the league.

364
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,837
- The league president
is a total faggot, okay?

365
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,275
Now I say one thing,
and I mean,

366
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,779
literally,
one thing as a joke,

367
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,213
and I get thrown out
of the league.

368
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,518
- I'm not a homophobe.

369
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,054
Do I look like
a homophobe?

370
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,324
I love the gays.

371
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,985
I mean, not, you know-
- Yeah.

372
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,528
- Not like-
- Yeah, okay, Dad.

373
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,563
We're leaving.

374
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,257
Go back to your book, okay?

375
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,232
I'll say hello to your
old cronies if I see them.

376
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,895
- At least take my ball.

377
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,597
- Dad, I bowl, like,
once a year.

378
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,264
I don't need a custom
bowling ball.

379
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,104
- Hey, my ball and I were
legends in this town,

380
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,872
and it's your responsibility
to carry on that legacy.

381
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,469
- Bye, Dad.

382
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,208
- Bye.

383
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,442
- Wait!

384
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:07,819
- # She's my alibi #

385
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,954
# And she gets me high #

386
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,065
# Well, she's a worker
at the grocery #

387
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,400
# And she's to care about
only me #

388
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,337
# Baby, get back #

389
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:32,712
# She's my 9:00 to 5:00 #

390
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,117
# And she makes me smile #

391
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,019
- Hey, Caleb,
I got you a beer.

392
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,720
Whoa.

393
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:43,954
Is that Hannah, man?

394
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,053
- No.

395
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,597
- You know, dude,
I think it is.

396
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,690
- No, it's not, J.T.

397
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,394
And you just
shut the fuck up

398
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,733
or I'm gonna knock your
fuckin' teeth out, okay?

399
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,295
- Okay, sorry.

400
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,103
I think it's your turn
to bowl, though, man.

401
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,075
- Take my turn.
I don't care.

402
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,543
- Caleb, it's the sixth inning.

403
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,307
I don't think Rocky-
- It's the sixth frame.

404
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,871
We're in the sixth frame,
J.T.

405
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,975
How many years have you
been playing this-

406
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,019
Here, give me a ball.

407
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,883
Here.

408
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:10,922
Yeah?

409
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,456
Here.

410
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,491
How's that?

411
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,547
Is that good enough for you?

412
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,593
You asshole.

413
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,957
- Do you want your beer?

414
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,461
- Where the fuck
are you going?

415
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,929
- I need smokes.

416
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:24,025
- He's like a goddamn fart
in a frying pan.

417
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,767
- Hey.
- Hi.

418
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,000
- Hi, Molly, how are you?
- Hi, Caleb.

419
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,167
Good. How are you?

420
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,938
- Can I just get a pack
of cigarettes, please?

421
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,036
- Yeah, um, I got, uh,
I got menthols.

422
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,080
I got, uh-

423
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,115
- It's-anything is fine.

424
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,149
- Whatever? Okay.

425
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,183
- Yeah, that's-

426
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,276
- You're easy, huh?

427
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,411
- Yeah.

428
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,148
- These menthols.

429
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,621
- Okay.

430
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,282
- No, no, no, no, don't-
don't give me your money.

431
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,326
I don't want it.
- Really?

432
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,224
- Yeah, really.
- Thank you, Molly.

433
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,024
- You're welcome.
- I guess I'll-

434
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,223
I'll-
I'll see you around.

435
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,492
- Yeah, I hope.

436
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,658
- Caleb.
- Hey.

437
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,201
- Hi.

438
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,260
- How are you?

439
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,429
- Emma.

440
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,268
- Yeah, no, I know.
I'm-

441
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,171
- Oh, you bowl here?

442
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,871
- Well, it's the only
bowling alley in town, so...

443
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,243
- Oh, yeah.
- Kind of...

444
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,077
- That's true; oh, did you
see Peter over there?

445
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,241
We're in-
we're in lane one.

446
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,284
- I did, yeah.

447
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,545
- Do you want to come
and join us?

448
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,419
- No, you know,
I'm in the middle

449
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,050
of a league match right now,
so I'm kind of-

450
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,093
- Oh.

451
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,594
- It's fuckin' lame.

452
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,927
- But, uh, anyway...

453
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,023
- What?

454
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,063
- Hey, can-

455
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,968
can you tell me why Peter
is all of a sudden,

456
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,303
he's dressing like, uh, like
Mike Wallace or something?

457
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,444
- Is he-is he a Republican
now or-

458
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,708
- Yeah, your dad said something
about that too.

459
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,777
- Well, no, it was nice to-
to see you.

460
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,913
- Yeah.
Good to see you too.

461
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,015
Oh, Caleb, um...

462
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,583
- Yeah?

463
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,721
- Can I maybe bum a couple
cigarettes off of you?

464
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,063
- I thought you didn't
like cigarette smoke

465
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,101
or something.

466
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,603
- Well, actually Peter
doesn't.

467
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,138
I- I smoke.

468
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,298
He doesn't really
know that,

469
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,140
so I kind of sneak a couple
at a time.

470
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,337
You know.

471
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,246
Please?

472
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,808
- Sure.

473
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,356
How many?

474
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,390
- Just two.

475
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,425
- There you go.

476
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,550
- Thank you.

477
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,523
Oh, sorry.

478
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,497
It's just easier
to hide 'em there.

479
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,158
- I don't care.

480
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,103
Oh, and could you
just not tell Peter?

481
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,639
- Yes, if-if-
can you do me a favor

482
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,140
and not tell Peter
you saw me?

483
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,176
- Sure.

484
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,710
- Thanks.

485
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,576
And don't tell Donald.

486
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,615
- Sure.

487
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,774
- Is that okay?

488
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,942
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

489
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,645
Okay.

490
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,697
- That was some disappearing act
you pulled on us last night.

491
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:17,867
- Uh, sorry.

492
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,740
- Yeah, well,
don't apologize to me.

493
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,403
Apologize to J.T.

494
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,947
He was like a lost puppy dog
the rest of the night.

495
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,848
He looks up to you,
you know.

496
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,283
- Yeah.

497
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,220
- Hey, look.

498
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,520
You want to prove to everyone
you're an asshole, fine.

499
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,026
J.T. is my nephew.

500
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,857
All right?

501
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,328
He's a nice kid.

502
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,661
He's dumber than rocks,
I know, but, uh,

503
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,896
he thinks you walk on water,
so, uh...

504
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,001
Don't be letting him down
again, okay?

505
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,042
- Sure.

506
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,906
- Okay.

507
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,208
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

508
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,247
- I don't know, Rock.

509
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,804
Are you
asking me out on a date?

510
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,146
- It's Thanksgiving,
you dumb shit.

511
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,185
What are you doing?

512
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,914
- Oh, nothin'.

513
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,219
I don't celebrate the fact
that my ancestors

514
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,918
exterminated
a race of people.

515
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,119
- Well, I do.

516
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,923
My old lady's
a hell of a cook.

517
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:11,963
Why don't you come over?

518
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,759
- I'd rather not.

519
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,390
- I'm not asking.

520
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,459
Be there around 7:00, all right?

521
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,835
Bring a bottle of wine
or something, okay?

522
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:22,895
- All right.

523
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,134
- I'm gonna get you fucked up,

524
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,733
and I'm gonna send you home
with my niece.

525
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,607
She's ugly as hell,
but she gives great head.

526
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,113
- I-I-I don't want to know
about that.

527
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,614
- Hmm.

528
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,082
So I'm told.

529
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,118
- Jesus, Rock, just-

530
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,085
- Well, whatever, yeah.

531
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,554
- Take it easy.

532
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,879
- Caleb?

533
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:04,937
Hi.

534
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,712
- Hey.

535
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,448
We keep, uh, running into
each other, don't we?

536
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,149
What-what are you
doing here?

537
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,418
- I'm grocery shopping.

538
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,585
I think that's pretty much
what everyone's doing here:

539
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,889
grocery shopping.

540
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,054
- No, that's not
what I meant.

541
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,530
I meant, I'm sure Donald
sent you here.

542
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,863
He likes to keep
his houseguests busy,

543
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,596
so it makes sense.

544
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,160
- Are you a big red wine
drinker?

545
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,967
- What's that?

546
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,634
- You like red wine?

547
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,040
- Oh, uh, not really.

548
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,946
It's-

549
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,144
- I love red wine.

550
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,618
- Yeah, me too.

551
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:46,179
- Hey, are you okay?

552
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,224
- I'm just-
I'm-I'm in a hurry,

553
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,259
and I don't, uh,
you know,

554
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,385
I don't really like it here,
and so I'm trying to hurry.

555
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,429
- Oh, okay.

556
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,827
- Are Donald
and Peter here?

557
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,864
- Um, no.

558
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,095
It's just me.

559
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,295
Are you sure you're okay?

560
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,803
- I'd like to talk to you.

561
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,014
- Okay.

562
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,982
You want to talk here?

563
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,282
- Um, I want to talk
about my brother.

564
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,321
But...

565
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,582
- Okay.

566
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,056
- I don't want-
I don't want to do it here.

567
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,095
- When do you want
to talk about him?

568
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,390
Caleb.

569
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,236
- I didn't want
to do this here,

570
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,399
but I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

571
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,103
Look, I don't want you
fuckin' my brother up.

572
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,236
Okay?

573
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,370
- Oh, okay.

574
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,177
- I know you're
a little whore, okay?

575
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,083
You don't fool me with
your flirty little tops

576
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,281
and your fuckin' cliché
punk-rock bullshit, okay?

577
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,517
I know you slept with half
the fuckin' frat guys

578
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,751
at that stupid school
of yours,

579
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,090
and I don't want you
destroying my brother.

580
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,686
You understand me?

581
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,958
He's a sweet kid,
and he's a goddamn virgin,

582
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,659
and I just know that
you're this train wreck

583
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,599
that he's not gonna be able
to get out of the way of.

584
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:05,897
- How dare you talk to me
like that!

585
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,937
- I asked around.

586
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,563
I asked about you, okay?

587
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,631
I asked about you, and I know
you're a little whore.

588
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,836
Don't try and tell me
otherwise, okay?

589
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,278
Now I am never gonna
see you again.

590
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,145
But I swear to God,
if you fuck him up,

591
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,378
I will dig a hole,
and I will put you in it.

592
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,580
I will kill you, and I will
put you in the fuckin' ground.

593
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,850
I don't care
that you're a girl.

594
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,255
I don't give a shit, okay?

595
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,761
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

596
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,798
You understand me?

597
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,593
You better nod your head
or do some fuckin' thing

598
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,300
so I know that you hear
what I'm telling you.

599
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,190
- Hey.
- Stop.

600
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,452
- Hey.

601
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,492
- Stop, no, don't-
don't come near me!

602
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,549
I'll scream,
I'll scream!

603
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,617
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

604
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,787
Don't scream.
Don't scream.

605
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,228
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?

606
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,322
So I'm sorry.

607
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,026
- Why the fuck would you
say those things?

608
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,068
Are you crazy?

609
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,538
- No, no, I swear I'm not crazy.

610
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,666
I'm not-I'm not crazy.

611
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,710
I'm sorry I'm crying.

612
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,972
I'm fuckin' crying.

613
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,174
I don't-
I'm sorry, okay?

614
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,581
Just please don't say
anything to Peter,

615
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,744
okay, or Donald.

616
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,844
Please don't say anything
to Donald, okay?

617
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,889
I'm-I'm-

618
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,322
- Don't fuck with me!

619
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,359
Fuck.

620
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,552
Oh, shit.

621
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,686
- God.

622
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,499
- Oh, shit.

623
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,434
Look, I'm a little fucked up
right now, okay?

624
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,132
Just please don't
tell my brother,

625
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:25,266
and please don't tell Donald
about this.

626
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,605
Don't tell anybody about this!

627
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,804
- I won't, I won't!

628
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,244
Just shut up.
You're making a scene.

629
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,747
- Okay.

630
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,975
Okay.

631
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,381
I'm done.

632
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,249
I'm done.

633
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,392
I'm sorry.

634
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,726
- This is all
really delicious, Emma.

635
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,166
Where did you learn
to cook like this?

636
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,203
- My mother, mostly.

637
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,568
Before she, uh,

638
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,869
started drinking
every afternoon and evening,

639
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,466
she was
a pretty good cook.

640
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,477
- A drunk, huh?

641
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,206
Is she single?

642
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,983
What?

643
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,711
I'm making conversation.

644
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,777
- No, my-my mom and dad
are still together.

645
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,686
They have an arrangement.

646
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,214
- Caleb?
- Whoa!

647
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,880
What the fuck
are you doing out here?

648
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,183
- What am /
doing out here?

649
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,190
- I'm-I'm-I'm leaving now.

650
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,748
- No, no, wait.

651
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,352
I think you owe me
an explanation.

652
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,919
- Okay, I think
you're underestimating

653
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,555
how awkward this is for me.

654
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,826
- You want to tell me

655
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,165
why you called me a whore
at the grocery store?

656
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,431
- You don't want to know

657
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,904
why I'm out in front
of Donald's house

658
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:12,374
in the middle of the night
with a camera?

659
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,671
- Not really.

660
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,742
- Uh, do you have
another cigarette?

661
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,034
Thanks.

662
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,662
- So?

663
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,572
- Right.

664
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,872
Peter told me that you-

665
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:52,246
you cheated on your boyfriend
to be with him, and-

666
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,783
well, hearing that, I-

667
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,978
you know, I was cheated on
very recently,

668
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,113
and, uh,

669
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,250
I don't want you
to hurt Peter.

670
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,022
Also, I haven't slept
in over a week,

671
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,620
so there's that.

672
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,155
Literally over a week.

673
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,758
So I'm-I'm kind of,
you know,

674
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,237
I find myself in, uh,
sort of in a-

675
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:19,367
in a daze between being
asleep and awake,

676
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,638
and I find myself doing,
you know,

677
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,077
strange things.

678
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,614
A small example of that,
the other day,

679
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,379
I actually introduced myself
to a tree.

680
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,545
So, um,
it's not a joke.

681
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,782
You know, suddenly I'm in
the middle of doing something.

682
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,552
I'm talking to somebody
or I'm driving

683
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:39,324
or thinking about how small
they could make a T-shirt.

684
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,937
I'm sorry.

685
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,709
- I'm not a whore.

686
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,576
- Okay.

687
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,513
- Are you growing a beard?

688
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,683
- No.

689
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:12,388
Just haven't shaved
in quite a while.

690
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,701
I should probably
get going, so...

691
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,037
- Yeah.

692
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,308
- I think I landed
on a sprinkler.

693
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,684
- Okay.

694
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,031
Okay, time-out.

695
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,430
Just a little break.

696
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,697
- The old man needs a breather.

697
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,408
- Donald?

698
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,377
- Yes, my dear?

699
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,040
- Peter hasn't really
told me anything

700
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,811
about his mother,

701
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,150
and if you wouldn't mind,

702
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,155
would you be good enough
to share with me

703
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:49,021
a little bit
while we're walking here?

704
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,060
- Okay.

705
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,890
What would you like to know?

706
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,953
- Anything, I guess.

707
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,124
He told me that she died
when he was 12,

708
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,828
and that's all
I really know.

709
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,871
- I don't know how much
Peter really remembers.

710
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:05,500
He was probably ten
the last time he saw her.

711
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,873
- Oh.

712
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,970
I didn't know that.

713
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:14,143
- Yeah.

714
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,310
- Donald?

715
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,353
- Yeah?

716
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,116
- If it's okay,

717
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,885
I'd like to hear
a little bit more.

718
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,153
- Is there a reason
you haven't asked Peter this?

719
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,661
- No, I have.

720
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,699
- I don't know if it's-

721
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,670
Okay.

722
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,809
All right, it's not
a happy tale, I'm afraid.

723
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,640
Diane-

724
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,148
that's Caleb
and Peter's mother-

725
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,014
She was having an affair
with another man.

726
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,351
I found out about it,

727
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:56,382
and I asked her
to leave the house.

728
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,827
I was pretty devastated,
as you can imagine.

729
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,831
When I told the boys
about it, they-

730
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,764
they didn't want
to see her,

731
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,496
didn't want to talk to her
or anything.

732
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,060
You know,
they felt like me.

733
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:12,007
They felt
they were betrayed.

734
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,443
And then,
about a year later, she-

735
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:19,950
she was diagnosed
with cancer.

736
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,110
Four months after that,
she died.

737
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:26,987
It was a pretty dark time
for all of us.

738
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,220
- And Peter never saw her
that entire time?

739
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:32,262
- Not just Peter.

740
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,626
None of us did.

741
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,937
- J.T., may I ask you
something?

742
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:42,973
- Yeah.

743
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,436
- Have you ever thought
about hurting someone?

744
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:53,449
- Sure, all the time.

745
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,486
Remember that night,
drank the pony at Blue Ribbon,

746
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,919
I was getting
fuckin' hammered.

747
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,923
I told you I thought I killed
some dude on my walk home?

748
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,323
- No.

749
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,830
- Yeah, remember when we were
working on the place in Norfolk,

750
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,524
and we were doing
the drywall?

751
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,726
I'm pretty sure
I told you that day.

752
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,894
- No, I totally would have
remembered that.

753
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,437
That is fucking crazy.

754
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,405
- Yeah, maybe I dreamt
I told you.

755
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,634
But anyway,
it turns out

756
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,471
I was blacked out at the bar
the whole night.

757
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,238
Wicked, though, right?

758
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,779
- Yeah.

759
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,581
- You need me to help you put
the drop on somebody?

760
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,617
I'd do it for you.

761
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,947
You know that.

762
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,615
- Nah, thanks, but I've been
thinking a lot

763
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,320
about hurting Donald,
which I suppose

764
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,952
if I were a teenager,
it would-

765
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,020
it would be normal
or healthy even,

766
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,498
but you know,

767
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,001
I'm getting old, boy.

768
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,535
You know, I saw my brother's
new girlfriend last night,

769
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:56,672
and it occurred to me

770
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:02,117
that I'm becoming
that fucking cocksucker.

771
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,522
- Your dad wants to fuck
your brother's girlfriend too?

772
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,855
- No.

773
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:10,894
Well, I don't know.

774
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,053
Maybe.

775
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,723
- Thanks for coming over
last night, asshole.

776
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,857
My niece had to fuck
one of my cousins.

777
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:17,901
Real awkward.

778
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,367
- Sorry.

779
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,201
Oh, hey, uh, Rock,

780
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,037
I did get some sleep
last night, though.

781
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,599
- Wow.

782
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,872
- 45 minutes' worth.

783
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,106
- Did you hear that?

784
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,943
Hey, should we give him
a medal?

785
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,678
Did you dream of Venus,
play with your penis?

786
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,285
- Love him.

787
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,259
- Hey, Dad, how are we
doing over there?

788
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,488
We're getting pretty cold.

789
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,463
- Keep your shorts on there,
pencil dick,

790
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,021
'cause the masterpiece
is almost done.

791
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,532
- Masterpiece.

792
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,865
He's burning the shit
out of whatever he's cooking.

793
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,703
- Voilà.

794
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,870
- Nicely done.

795
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,104
- Come on, you just gotta,
you know, scrape off the-

796
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,975
- The scorched black cocoon

797
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,480
you've created
around the chicken breast?

798
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,947
- Emma, I assure you,
it'll be delicious.

799
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:06,983
- Oh, no, it's great.

800
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,177
Thank you so much, Donald.

801
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,480
- You're welcome,
my dear.

802
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,382
- What was that?

803
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,154
- One of
those damn raccoons.

804
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:22,665
- What the hell
is he doing?

805
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,633
I'm sorry.

806
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,999
- Your dad has a shotgun.

807
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,062
- Jesus, Dad,
what are you doing?

808
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,470
Dad!

809
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,031
Dad, have you
fucking lost it?

810
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,076
- Don't shoot!

811
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,201
Stop! Don't shoot!
Stop!

812
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,109
- Dad, it's Caleb!
- Stop! It's me!

813
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,842
- Put the gun down!
- Stop shooting the fuckin' gun!

814
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,017
- Are you okay?

815
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,146
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

816
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,055
- Why were you in the trees
just now?

817
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,116
What happened to your lip?

818
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,188
Hey, Donald.

819
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,290
- Were you hit?

820
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,495
- No, no, I'm fine.

821
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,832
I think you caught
a little bit

822
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,997
of the Lang's chicken coop,
though.

823
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,870
Actually, that's
a pretty good range on the, uh,

824
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:05,909
what is that, your.870?

825
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,568
Yeah, not bad.

826
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,910
- Yeah, pretty good.

827
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,312
Are you losing your hair?

828
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,350
- No.

829
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,509
I don't know.

830
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,019
Well, maybe a little.

831
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,782
- Yeah, well, you couldn't
blame me for that.

832
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,653
You know, you get that
from the mother's side.

833
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:22,492
- Okay.

834
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,526
- Wait, Caleb.

835
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,619
Why were you
in the trees just now?

836
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:30,065
- Oh, uh, just, uh...

837
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,606
I was just taking
some pictures.

838
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,479
- Trespass on my property again,
I will shoot you.

839
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,483
- Better work
on your aim then.

840
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,116
- I think you really,
really freaked Dad out.

841
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,094
Like, you guys go eight years
without speaking to one another,

842
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,326
and then you just appear,

843
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:07,098
literally, out of a puff
of smoke in the backyard.

844
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,163
I mean, dad could have
killed you.

845
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,678
Maybe the single most bizarre
thing I've ever seen.

846
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,849
I'm going to the restroom.

847
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,510
Don't eat my fries.

848
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,554
- I won't.

849
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:32,629
- What are you doing?

850
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,663
- What do you mean?

851
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,426
- I know you're taking pictures
of me, Caleb.

852
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,864
- Okay, I know
what you're thinking,

853
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,333
and you're wrong.

854
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,926
I don't have feelings
for you.

855
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,063
I don't even like you that much,
if you want to know the truth.

856
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,300
- I don't understand this.

857
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,966
You're-you're semi-normal
one second,

858
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,739
and the next second,
you're a complete lunatic.

859
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,279
I barely even know you,
Caleb.

860
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,609
- What do you
think about me

861
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,582
now that I said
that I don't like you?

862
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,948
- I don't know.

863
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:56,986
I don't know.

864
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,612
You-just stop, okay?

865
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,917
- Okay.
- Please, just stop it.

866
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,321
- Okay.

867
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,358
- It's just weird.

868
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,552
- I know it's weird.

869
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,458
- I don't want to have to
discuss this with Peter.

870
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,791
- Oh, well, you're not
gonna do that.

871
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,263
- I will if I have to.

872
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,663
- No, you won't.

873
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,932
- What-what do you-
what do you want from this?

874
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,537
- Just don't break his heart.

875
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,273
That's all.

876
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,712
You're so beautiful.

877
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,181
Don't break his heart,
please.

878
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,548
- I think
that you need help.

879
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,882
Stop it!

880
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,948
Stop!

881
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:45,631
- I started sleeping again
since we started, uh,

882
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:46,726
conversing.

883
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,738
I've been able to sleep.

884
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,331
I can't explain it.

885
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,301
- Oh, shit.

886
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,108
- Are you gonna be needing
a cigarette tonight?

887
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,580
Yes or no?

888
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,175
Oh, my God,
these are good.

889
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,083
Mm!

890
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,183
- Hi.

891
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,033
- Why are you guys so quiet?

892
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,761
- Hmm?

893
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,771
- Were you talking about me
when I was gone?

894
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,136
- No.

895
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,697
- Huh?

896
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,338
- Oh, hey, are you guys
gonna need a ride

897
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,609
back to school on Sunday?

898
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,310
I probably don't
have to work, so-

899
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,477
- Are you seriously offering
to give us a ride right now?

900
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,850
- Yeah, sure.

901
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,718
- Well, you kind of acted

902
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,189
like I needed to give you
my firstborn

903
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,486
to pick us up
in the first place.

904
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,958
- I know.

905
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,688
I must have been
in one of my moods, you know.

906
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,066
- Uh, well, the trains
are running again,

907
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,999
so you know-
but thanks anyway.

908
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:59,303
Hey, what did you say
happened to your lip?

909
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,573
- Oh, you don't
want to know.

910
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,752
Excuse me.

911
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,906
Peter?

912
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,878
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

913
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,744
- Uh, yeah.

914
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,544
I'll just-I'll see you
inside, okay?

915
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,448
- Okay.

916
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,418
- I just wanted to, uh,
talk to you about something.

917
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,461
- Yeah?

918
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,996
Well, what is it?

919
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,929
- Emma.

920
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,100
Are you serious?

921
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,763
Like, you should be
fuckin', like, dead right now,

922
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,669
like, with buckshot
in your chest,

923
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,300
and-and-and this is still
what's on your mind?

924
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,776
- Yeah, well,
this is important to me, man.

925
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,938
And I just think,
you know...

926
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,014
- I think you need
to be careful with her.

927
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,314
I'm serious.

928
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,981
I catch her looking at me,

929
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,024
and I don't know.

930
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,353
I just, you know,

931
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,519
I just wanted you to be aware
of it, that's all.

932
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,959
- I think that's
in your head, Caleb.

933
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,327
And I think
I would have noticed

934
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:29,490
something like that,
you know?

935
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,533
- Hey, you know what?

936
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,567
I hope it is.

937
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,296
I really do.

938
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,605
- You haven't noticed at all
the way we look at each other?

939
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,198
- What do you mean?

940
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,508
- I mean,

941
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,310
I think we're in love.

942
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,786
Oh, sorry, but-

943
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,389
What?

944
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,626
You're-you're not serious,
are you?

945
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,689
- Yes, I'm fucking serious.

946
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,532
- Why would I make that up?

947
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,594
- Oh, that's hilarious.

948
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,903
- She wants to-

949
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,704
- She wants to?

950
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,471
- I'm-I'm a virgin, okay?

951
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,744
- I know.

952
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,683
- Yeah, well, she wants

953
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:28,384
to take my virginity.

954
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,221
So we're gonna-

955
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,420
anyway, it-

956
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,693
I'm in love with this girl.

957
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,631
- Are you sure about that?

958
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,100
- Yeah.

959
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,034
I'm sure.

960
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,834
I'm sure about how I feel,
anyways.

961
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,772
- Well, have you told her?

962
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,709
I mean, have you-have you
told her how you feel?

963
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,940
- No.

964
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,539
But I want to.

965
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:54,709
And I think this is-

966
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,013
I think I might do it
on this trip.

967
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,577
I think this-spending time
like this together,

968
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:03,422
it's-it's good for us,
you know?

969
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,560
What the hell's the matter
with you?

970
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,927
You look like
you're gonna be sick.

971
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:08,965
- Oh, no, no, no.

972
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,363
I'm just-

973
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,234
I'm just really tired
right now.

974
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,534
I'm-I'm really
happy for you, Peter.

975
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,133
I guess I was wrong
about her being a whore.

976
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,940
That's terrific news.

977
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,037
- Uh-huh.

978
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,105
Thanks, Caleb.

979
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:30,552
- Sure.

980
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,020
Uh, hey, Peter?

981
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,558
You know I love you,
though, right?

982
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,952
Like, I've got your back, or
whatever they're saying.

983
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,359
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

984
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,399
- I'm serious, you know.

985
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,059
- Thanks, Caleb.

986
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,562
- You know, um-

987
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,509
Never mind.

988
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,544
I'll talk to you later.

989
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,677
- Yeah, sure.

990
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,171
- Your dad told me that
you never saw your mother

991
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,268
in the hospital
when she got sick.

992
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,973
I told you
all about my parents:

993
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:10,782
their drinking,
my panic attacks.

994
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,448
You don't have anything
on me.

995
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,586
- What my dad said is true.

996
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:26,569
Except that Caleb did see
my mother before she died.

997
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,365
He was the only one
to see her,

998
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:33,705
and he and my father
haven't spoken since then.

999
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:46,521
- Have you ever been in love
with the idea of someone?

1000
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,148
- Idea?

1001
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,420
I don't know what you mean.

1002
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,724
- Okay.

1003
00:53:53,797 --> 00:54:00,168
Say there's-
there's someone in your life,

1004
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,764
and you know you can't
be in love with them.

1005
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,172
You don't really know them.

1006
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,438
Maybe you know
that you're-you're-

1007
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,001
you're not really
right for them.

1008
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,345
No, you know that whatever
it is you're feeling

1009
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,316
is really just an attraction

1010
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,818
towards an image
of that person

1011
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:21,721
you've created
in your mind?

1012
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,988
- I don't know.

1013
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,028
- No, of course.

1014
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,120
I'm sorry.

1015
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,324
You were probably
molested as a child.

1016
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,924
Were you molested as a child?

1017
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,230
- What?

1018
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,294
- Molested, you know.

1019
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,068
- You have no right
to ask me that.

1020
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,803
- Oh, right.

1021
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,504
I fuck you in the ass
for 50 bucks,

1022
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:43,637
but you get
bent out of shape

1023
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,078
when I inquire
about your past.

1024
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,706
That makes a lot of sense.

1025
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,750
You know what? Fuck this.

1026
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,377
I'm out of here.

1027
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,524
Sorry I said that.

1028
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,794
That was really,
really rude, okay?

1029
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:07,769
Also, I-I didn't tip you
very well this time.

1030
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:19,971
Have a good weekend.

1031
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,579
- Oh, shit.

1032
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,441
- Emma.

1033
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,953
Hi.

1034
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,547
Hey, um, don't-

1035
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,319
don't be frightened, please.

1036
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,418
I'm-uh,
I just wanted to

1037
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:49,659
try and apologize to you
for kissing you earlier.

1038
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,257
I realize now

1039
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,530
how inappropriate
that might have been and-

1040
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:55,628
Ugh!

1041
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,002
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1042
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,668
So you know, I won't be
coming around here anymore,

1043
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,576
I can promise you that,
okay?

1044
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,810
Whew!

1045
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:10,250
God, this has just
gotten silly, hasn't it?

1046
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,344
I mean, look at me.

1047
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,879
I sleep in my freezing car
all night,

1048
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,984
just with the hope that
I'd be able to see you...

1049
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,097
To apologize to you.

1050
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,930
Anyway,
I've been acting childish,

1051
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,403
and-and-and-and
that's all I wanted to say.

1052
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,769
All right?

1053
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,671
Really, that-
that's it.

1054
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:37,475
I'm, uh, I'm-
I'm done.

1055
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,088
Do you think you-

1056
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:51,855
you might attempt
to accept my weird apology?

1057
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,226
- Sure.

1058
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,264
- Yeah?

1059
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,298
- Yeah.

1060
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,391
- Great.

1061
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,766
Okay.

1062
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:04,500
I feel better.

1063
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:09,307
So I guess it's-

1064
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,940
Good eve, m'lady.

1065
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,712
All right.

1066
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:16,752
- Caleb.

1067
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,583
- Yeah?

1068
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:22,750
- I'm locked out.

1069
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:26,226
Do you know of another way
in the house?

1070
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,263
- Yes.

1071
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,797
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,730
I, um-

1073
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,767
there's an old trick.

1074
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,165
I'm sure I could still do it.

1075
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,228
It's around the corner here.

1076
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:44,435
It's right down these steps
over here.

1077
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,467
Well, you're not exactly
in perfect garb for this.

1078
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,132
How-how about
I go in first,

1079
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,472
and I'll just-
I'll pull you in?

1080
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,511
- Okay.

1081
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,569
- Yeah.

1082
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,935
- I don't
ever want to see you again.

1083
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,535
Do you understand me?

1084
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,739
Ever.

1085
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,374
Okay.

1086
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:41,090
- All right.

1087
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,923
What the fuck is this?

1088
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,929
- I think I may have to quit,
Rocky.

1089
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,396
I'm not a good person.

1090
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,625
- Well, I know that,

1091
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,395
but don't you think we could
choose something

1092
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,700
a little less dramatic than this
to get the point across?

1093
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,072
- I'm gonna take
the rest of the day off.

1094
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,005
- Jesus, you're a piece
of work.

1095
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:16,423
- If you have to fire me,
well, that's okay.

1096
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:23,932
- Thank you.

1097
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,967
- You're welcome.

1098
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,370
- You all right, Caleb?

1099
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,501
I've never seen you
throw a hammer like that.

1100
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,319
Have you fucked
your brother's girlfriend yet?

1101
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,201
- No.

1102
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:03,329
But I want to
very, very badly.

1103
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,411
Very badly.

1104
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,503
- Then what are you
so bent out of shape about?

1105
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:12,878
I want to fuck
tons of chicks.

1106
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,246
- Fuckin' assholes.

1107
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,581
- You want to fuck
tons of...

1108
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,983
- Fuck you!

1109
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,612
- You know you want it.

1110
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,656
- Oh, yeah,
she wants it.

1111
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,190
She does.

1112
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:24,988
- J.T., excuse me
a minute.

1113
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,662
Let's see here.

1114
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,340
- Yeah.

1115
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,349
That's what I wanted.

1116
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,441
- Oh, hey, bros.

1117
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,917
Hey, listen, I have
a quick question.

1118
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,579
Do you guys like listening
to shitty music

1119
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,623
while you're butt-fucking
or after?

1120
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,942
- Get him, you fuckers!

1121
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,861
Well,
she's leaving tomorrow.

1122
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,267
I'll probably never
see her again,

1123
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:44,636
so thank fuckin' Christ.

1124
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,279
I just wish I could get over
this strange compulsion

1125
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:01,312
to protect Peter,
you know?

1126
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,085
Because-

1127
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,751
and the only way I know
how to do that

1128
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,990
is to-
to hurt him.

1129
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,900
- When I was a kid,

1130
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,597
my pa used to beat me up
pretty good

1131
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:20,301
if I messed something up.

1132
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,539
He made me cry a lot,

1133
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,477
but it made me tough,
you know?

1134
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,561
- Mmm, no, no, no.

1135
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,426
Up a little bit.

1136
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,930
No, over a little.

1137
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,168
Ooh, shit.

1138
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,374
Fuck.

1139
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,207
I'm sorry.

1140
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,285
I'm sorry.

1141
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,319
- No, it's okay.

1142
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:13,184
It's okay.

1143
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:21,786
- Almost, right?

1144
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:22,831
- Yeah.

1145
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:25,833
- Fuck.

1146
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,634
- # Ah, ah, ah #

1147
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:42,243
# Ah, ah, ah #

1148
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,444
# Ah #

1149
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:48,047
# Sleep don't visit #

1150
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,355
# So I choke on Sun #

1151
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:55,090
# And the days
blur into one #

1152
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,792
# Bags under my eyes #

1153
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:01,598
# All the things
I've felt and done #

1154
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:06,300
# Sheets are swaying #

1155
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,401
# From the old clothesline #

1156
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:13,380
# Like a row
of captured ghosts #

1157
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:27,392
- # Welcome home #

1158
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:29,761
# Ah, ah, ah #

1159
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,666
# Ah, come home #

1160
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,931
- Your face.

1161
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,939
- I know.

1162
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,812
Go up to my old room,

1163
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:53,013
take off all your clothes.

1164
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:55,022
Now.

1165
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:04,057
- # All my nightmares
escape my head #

1166
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:07,102
# Bar the door, please #

1167
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:10,263
# Don't let them in #

1168
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:16,642
# You were never
supposed to leave #

1169
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:23,550
# Now my head's splitting
at the seams #

1170
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,644
# And I don't know #

1171
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:33,059
# If I can breathe #

1172
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:38,466
# Ah, ah, ah #

1173
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:43,130
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #

1174
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:48,032
# Ah, ah, ah #

1175
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:04,653
- Ah!

1176
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,687
Shh!

1177
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,120
Shut the fuck up.

1178
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,726
- Shh!

1179
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:54,719
- I haven't seen these photos
in eight years.

1180
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,399
- You didn't keep any with you?

1181
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,204
- No, I did.

1182
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,239
I just-

1183
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,241
I moved out
in a hurry, so...

1184
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,334
- Why were you
the only person

1185
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,072
to see your mom
in the hospital?

1186
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:19,315
Your dad, Donald,
he told me,

1187
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:22,983
and Peter told me
a little bit, and...

1188
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:57,684
I was really close
with my mom,

1189
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:03,527
but I couldn't bring myself
to speak to her.

1190
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,032
I wouldn't answer her calls.

1191
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,536
I- I just-I shut her
out of my life completely.

1192
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,595
She got sick
not long after that,

1193
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:13,869
and when she went
into the hospital,

1194
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:17,434
I started really pushing Donald
for information,

1195
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:23,110
and it all just hit me.

1196
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:27,178
He's totally full of shit.

1197
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,816
So I just went straight
to my mom in the hospital,

1198
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,416
and she told me that Donald

1199
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,552
had been fuckin' around
on her for years,

1200
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:34,926
and it finally got bad enough

1201
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:39,400
that she just
packed up and left.

1202
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,459
She didn't think Donald
would be vindictive enough

1203
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:45,098
to take her fucking boys
away from her, you know?

1204
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:57,579
- Why didn't you tell Peter?

1205
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,679
- Well, he-

1206
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,522
he was
12 years old, so I...

1207
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,548
You know...

1208
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:33,212
If I didn't know any better,

1209
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:37,349
I would have thought that-

1210
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,393
I don't know.

1211
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:42,487
I would have thought that, uh,

1212
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,794
it was your first time
or something.

1213
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:45,833
I don't know.

1214
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:46,868
It was...

1215
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:49,771
I got a-

1216
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,830
I don't know.

1217
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,587
- No, no, no, you-

1218
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,725
- Right?

1219
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,556
- I'm sorry.

1220
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,256
- You-you're not-

1221
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,026
you-you-you-you-
okay.

1222
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,671
Oh, I gotta go.

1223
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:29,711
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1224
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,109
Where are you going?

1225
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,373
Caleb.

1226
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,310
- Peter's in love
with you, okay?

1227
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:44,150
It's my brother.

1228
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:49,122
I'm sorry.

1229
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:15,788
Fuckin' shit.

1230
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,965
- Pretty sure I told you
I'd shoot you

1231
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,766
if I saw you
on my property again.

1232
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:34,673
Yeah, I guess you didn't
take that seriously.

1233
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,711
- Not really.

1234
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:45,142
- Did you just fuck
your brother's girlfriend?

1235
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:49,088
Of course you did,
you piece of shit.

1236
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:53,617
Well, are you gonna tell him,
or should I?

1237
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,358
- Oh, no, you're not gonna tell
him a goddamn thing, Donald.

1238
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,593
- Of course I am.

1239
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:02,535
Jesus, he's my son.

1240
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:03,571
- So?

1241
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,435
I'm your son.

1242
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,504
I'm your son, Donald!

1243
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,947
I'm your son!

1244
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,951
You left me,
you remember?

1245
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:21,318
You left me,
'cause I fuckin' found you out.

1246
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:26,524
Why don't you
tell me something?

1247
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,859
Why don't you tell me
how much of a fucking coward

1248
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,421
you have to be
to erase your son?

1249
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,627
- Oh, hey, hold on a second.

1250
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:37,160
Come on,
I tried to reach out.

1251
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:40,174
I found out
where your place is,

1252
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:45,009
and I tried to come over
a couple of times.

1253
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,071
- I've lived less
than two miles away from you

1254
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:50,084
for more than eight years, Dad.

1255
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:02,190
You were my fuckin' hero.

1256
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:06,968
- No.

1257
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,003
No.

1258
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,301
- Peter.

1259
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:53,008
- Hi.

1260
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,810
- Who'd you think
it was gonna be?

1261
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,818
- I thought-I thought
it was gonna be you.

1262
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,550
Sorry.

1263
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:03,591
- Are you okay?

1264
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,285
- Yeah.

1265
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:11,765
- You're not gonna tell him,
not ever,

1266
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,495
'cause if you do,
I'll tell him your secrets,

1267
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:19,131
and he won't ever
speak to you again.

1268
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:23,109
I know you don't
want to die lonely, Dad.

1269
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:53,802
- You look kind of sweaty.

1270
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:58,239
I was having a bad dream.

1271
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:05,786
What?

1272
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,412
- Oh.

1273
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:08,979
- Did-did you
want to sleep in here?

1274
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,389
- Yeah.

1275
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:15,190
I was just-

1276
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:19,097
I was just thinking,

1277
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,158
do you think
we could try again?

1278
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:43,476
Well, thanks, Dad.

1279
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,251
It was an experience,
as usual.

1280
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,984
- My pleasure.

1281
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:52,788
You two are sweet
as sugar together.

1282
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:57,355
- Thank you very much,
Donald, for having me.

1283
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:00,034
- Okay.

1284
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,362
- Well.
- Well.

1285
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:10,539
- All right.

1286
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,274
- Peter, could you-

1287
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,713
hang back just for a second,
will you?

1288
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:15,750
- I'll meet you inside.

1289
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:16,977
- Okay.

1290
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:27,185
- I don't know
where to start.

1291
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:32,427
I haven't been
a perfect father.

1292
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,594
I want you to know
that I know that.

1293
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:39,003
I've made mistakes,

1294
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,302
some of which were
unavoidable.

1295
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,808
You know,
I can't really be

1296
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,901
held responsible
for those, but...

1297
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,945
What I'm trying to say...

1298
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:55,515
You know,
you're old enough now

1299
01:24:55,590 --> 01:25:00,823
to know that sometimes
people do things that-

1300
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:05,992
that they know are wrong,
but they-

1301
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:09,764
they just do 'em anyway,
'cause-

1302
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:12,830
'cause to do
the right thing

1303
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:16,035
might be too painful.

1304
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:26,649
And also...

1305
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:28,245
I love you.

1306
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:34,024
And I don't say that enough.

1307
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:35,153
We don't say that enough.

1308
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,492
I mean, I'm not-
I'm not-

1309
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:38,088
I'm not blaming you,
necessarily.

1310
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:41,795
Just, you could, you know,
you could say it more if-

1311
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:46,330
I'm just saying,
you know?

1312
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:54,973
Okay.

1313
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,951
All right,
get out of here.

1314
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:31,444
- # All of my dreams #

1315
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:37,253
# They all roll on by #

1316
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:55,376
- I love you.

1317
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,084
I'm sorry.

1318
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,182
I'm sorry.

1319
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,159
I shouldn't
have said anything.

1320
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:18,359
- No, no, no, no,
don't be sorry.

1321
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:20,958
- What?

1322
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:34,472
- # And hidden past
the business sense #

1323
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:39,479
# As water lilies
over streams #

1324
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:44,218
# Rivers browse
coffee beans #

1325
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,455
# Pistol visions
in my hands #

1326
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:52,158
# I want to see my blood
across the sand #

1327
01:27:52,233 --> 01:28:04,806
# Morning always
looked like you #

1328
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:08,610
# And from my window
the only view #

1329
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:11,447
- You want to come in?

1330
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:12,679
- Yeah, sure.

1331
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:16,417
- # As you walk away
not lookin' #

1332
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:57,730
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #

1333
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:02,400
# All of my dreams #

1334
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:06,770
# My life spent awake #

1335
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:11,244
# In the dark of my veins #

1336
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:14,145
# Oh, nothing can stay #

1337
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:18,345
# I continue through
a backlit world #

1338
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:22,355
# Where the willows bend
like long black curls #

1339
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:24,357
# Down your face from life #

1340
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,393
# Through the kinks
in your spine #

1341
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,486
# From the last thing
we spoke #

1342
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:30,895
# To the very first line #

1343
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:34,401
# Love is something that we
couldn't help but do #

1344
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,733
# That something
turned to someone else #

1345
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,431
# Somebody new #

1346
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:40,565
# I just love to love #

1347
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,632
# And you love to cry #

1348
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,905
# I meant it
through each second #

1349
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:46,571
# That we said good-bye #

1350
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,774
# And I came up
past a station #

1351
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,977
# Where the floors
are all blue #

1352
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,020
# And somethin' 'bout
the way it looked #

1353
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:54,918
# Reminded me of you #

1354
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:58,686
# It might have been
how far I've come #

1355
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:04,096
# So I dropped a match
until the floor was gone #

1356
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:09,000
# All of my trains #

1357
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,096
# I let them all go #

1358
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:17,110
# All of my trains #

1359
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:20,204
# I let them all go #

1360
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:25,150
# All of my trains #

1361
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:28,313
# I let them all go #

1362
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:33,827
# All of my trains #

1363
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:46,834
# Then I lit the thread
across the station door #

1364
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:50,742
# Kentucky straight,
I hit the floor #

1365
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:54,475
# The station
tousled up in flames #

1366
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:58,747
# But I could only read
the bottle's name #

1367
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,847
# And I weaned its breast
and turned it dry #

1368
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:07,122
# Like the wake of summer
from July #

1369
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:11,393
# And got up and tripped
over my knees #

1370
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:15,664
# Which caved in
at the slightest breeze #

1371
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:24,870
# Morning always
looked like you #

1372
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:29,906
# All of my trains #

1373
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,953
# I let them all go #

1374
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:37,980
# All of my trains #

1375
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:40,584
# I let 'em all go #
