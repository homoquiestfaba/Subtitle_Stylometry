00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,641
We honeymooned in Sea Island.

340
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,275
- [gasping]
- [Bunny] Oh!

341
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,310
- [Violet] What?
- We honeymooned in Sea Island.

342
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,278
Seriously?

343
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,513
Yeah, did you eat at Dominick's?

344
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,582
- I was a little nervous.
- [Bill chuckles]

345
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,216
Took a while
to get used to things.

346
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,118
Yeah. It takes a minute
to settle in.

347
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,986
- Yeah.
- But it gets easier, though.

348
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,055
- It does. Yeah.
- [sighs] Well, it...

349
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,524
I'm just really excited
to be here.

350
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,292
- So excited, I can't even...
- We couldn't tell.

351
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,862
To be honest, I've been
out of it since we arrived.

352
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,296
Yeah.

353
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,497
- Bill says it's the jetlag.
- [Bunny] Mm-hm.

354
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,432
It's all just been
a bit of a blur.

355
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,267
It's the desert air.
You'll get used to it.

356
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,303
That's what
Dr. Collins said, too.

357
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,807
He was so sweet to stop by.

358
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:14,107
- [Bill] And, Jack, you're...
- [Jack] I'm a technical engineer.

359
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,710
She should come shopping
with us.

360
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,478
[Jack] A different department
than, uh, Dean and Ted.

361
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,379
Yeah, technically a worse,
less important department.

362
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,583
I haven't really gotten
to talk to Frank very much.

363
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,586
Frank doesn't have to talk
to you.

364
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,620
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

365
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,088
You have no idea
how extraordinary he is.

366
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,858
Or what he can do.

367
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,158
You're lucky to even know
who he is,

368
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,827
let alone be standing
in his house.

369
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:36,196
- [Bunny and Violet laughing]
- I'm just excited. I'm sorry.

370
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:39,032
I was just excited. Okay.

371
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,835
[glass chiming]

372
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:42,837
- Oh! Guys, guys, guys. Go, go, go, go.
- [Dean] Ooh, here we go.

373
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:45,907
- [Violet] This way?
- Yeah, you should go in front.

374
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:48,475
[light chatter, laughter]

375
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,049
[Shelley]
Gather 'round, everyone.

376
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,287
Now, usually,
we don't have the opportunity

377
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,524
to welcome couples in our home.

378
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,660
But on this occasion,
we just couldn't wait

379
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,796
to celebrate
our newest residents.

380
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,164
Bill, Violet...

381
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,234
I am so happy for you,

382
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,403
that you get to learn
from my husband...

383
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,973
and join this mission

384
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,108
and become a part
of this family.

385
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:27,314
Frank has built something
truly special.

386
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,119
What he's created out here,
it's...

387
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,688
It's a different way.

388
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,658
A better way.

389
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,794
- And we only have each other...
- [woman] Why are we here?

390
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,295
[man whispering tersely]

391
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,264
[whispering]
Let's go, right now.

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,669
We shouldn't be here.

393
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,975
- [whispering] What was that?
- [faint chatter]

394
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,475
[Frank] Now, now.

395
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:03,618
Margaret and Ted are
going through a difficult time.

396
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:11,258
Margaret's question is right.
It is the good question to ask.

397
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,662
Why the hell are we here?

398
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,632
- [chuckles]
- [scattered laughter]

399
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:22,469
Why, when this landscape
can seem so...

400
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:26,708
barren, so hard, so dusty, so...

401
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,177
worthless?

402
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,447
Why not run?

403
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,482
Why not go back to safety,
status quo,

404
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,418
where it's safe,
where we should be?

405
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:44,157
No, I choose...
We choose to stand our ground.

406
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,292
Right?

407
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,697
To look harder, to dig deeper.

408
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:53,968
To mine that pure,

409
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:58,539
unbridled potential.

410
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:04,912
That gem of limitless
and unimaginable value.

411
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:10,551
It's just too easy to get
distracted by what seems.

412
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:14,756
Much more difficult, "braver,"
I would say...

413
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,326
to search for what could be.

414
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,931
- Dean...
- [Dean] Hm?

415
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:27,802
What is the enemy of progress?

416
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,470
- Chaos.
- Yes.

417
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:32,774
- [shudders]
- [Dean chuckles]

418
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,677
Nasty word. Chaos.

419
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:40,280
Merciless foe, that chaos.

420
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,317
Energy unfocused,
innovation hindered,

421
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,187
hope strangled,
greatness disguised.

422
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:50,457
I see greatness
in each one of you.

423
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,225
I know exactly who you are.

424
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,964
- What are we doing?
- [all] Changing the world.

425
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,701
- What are we doing?
- [all] Changing the world.

426
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,869
That's right.

427
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,806
I look around, I see
another reason why I'm here.

428
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:09,276
Once unfamiliar faces,
strangers, one and all, now...

429
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,345
one brave family.

430
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,915
Men like Dr. Collins.

431
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,249
One of our first, who built
this community with me.

432
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,020
Thank you,
Dr. Collins for your vision.

433
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:23,624
And adventurers like Bill,
our newest intrepid explorer.

434
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,893
This brave,
young Robinson Crusoe,

435
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,963
who's choosing to join us
on this adventure.

436
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,398
Bill, thank you
for being our partner in this.

437
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,804
And thank you, Violet,
for being his partner in this.

438
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,773
He could not do this
without you.

439
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,475
All of you wives...

440
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,479
We men, we ask a lot.

441
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:49,416
We ask for strength,
a shoulder to cry on...

442
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,620
food at home, a house cleaned,

443
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:55,322
and discretion, above all else.
And that...

444
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,259
That's very difficult.

445
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:07,201
You are my rock.

446
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,803
I would not be here without you.

447
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:11,471
Thank you.

[Alice] What? No.
That did not happen.

[sighing] She was upset.

500
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,856
It was humiliating,
and she's gonna get Ted fired.

00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,257
Oh.

Of course.
It was a terrible accident.

- Needs a little encouragement.

under one roof,

1044
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:25,479
seeing how much we've all grown.

1045
01:02:27,716 --> 01:02:29,250
But few...

1046
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,419
Few have grown as...

1047
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:36,190

1048
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,025

I've debated long and hard
about this, Lord knows. Whew!

1052
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,337
It's certainly
out of the ordinary.

1053
01:02:50,404 --> 01:02:54,108
But you know what? This man
is out of the ordinary.

1054

1055

1056
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,055
to invite you to join our...

1057
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,626

Look at this boy dance!

1074

Come on! Come on!

1075
01:04:44,586 --> 01:04:48,188
- [crying quietly]
- [music continues, faint]

1076
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:50,558

Look what he can do!

1080
01:05:01,068 --> 01:05:04,506
Hey. What's wrong? Honey.

1081
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:08,543
What happened? What's wrong?

1082
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:11,613
[Frank] It's extraordinary!

1083
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:18,620
[Frank laughing]

1084
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:20,722
Everything's fine. It's okay.

1085
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:22,055
Bunny, we need to go.

1086
01:05:22,122 --> 01:05:23,424
We need to get out of here
right now.

1087
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,993
- No, no, no. We're okay.
- We need to go.

1088
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:29,664
We're okay. Come on.
Tell me, what happened?

1089
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:32,734
[music increases in tempo]

1090
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:34,968
How about that, huh?

1091
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:37,104
You watching him dance?

1092
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:39,039
Margaret was right.

1093
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:44,178
She was asking questions
that they don't want us to ask.

1094
01:05:44,244 --> 01:05:47,247
And so they silenced her.

1095
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:49,183
She didn't slip.
It wasn't an accident.

1096
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:52,052
I saw it happen.
I saw her fall.

1097
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,288
They're lying about everything.

1098
01:05:57,826 --> 01:05:59,393
[Frank] Dance, Jack!

1099
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:04,599
Let's make him spin, shall we?

1100
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,167
And so I went out there,
and I saw it.

1101
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:09,303
You went... you went out where?

1102
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:13,006
[Frank] Yeah, that's it!
Come on, boy, faster!

1103
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:15,743
Keep it going! Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

1104
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:19,480
That's it!

1105
01:06:20,648 --> 01:06:23,685
- [music stops]
- [Frank] Ha-ha!

1106
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:26,353
Doesn't that make you believe?

1107
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:29,557
[laughing] Stand up!

1108
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:33,561
Stand up, take a bow!
Take a bow, you deserve it!

1109
01:06:33,628 --> 01:06:36,764
And when I touched it,
I saw something.

1110
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:40,367
And I keep remembering more.

1111
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:43,237
And I heard Frank's voice,
and he's in my head...

1112
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:45,573
It's more than just
a celebration

1113
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,477
of our freedom from society's
arbitrary regulations,

1114
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:55,717
it's a celebration
of potential unleashed!

1115
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:58,620
It's a reminder of who we are!

1116
01:06:58,686 --> 01:07:01,088
Can I just show you?
Let's just go out there.

1117
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:02,289
Everybody will be
distracted right now.

1118
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:03,591
We can take Dean's car.

1119
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:05,325
- We can head to...
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

1120
01:07:06,928 --> 01:07:09,263
- Have you lost your mind?
- What?

1121
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,031
You went to Headquarters?

1122
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,568
- Because I thought I saw a plane crash.
- It is the one rule...

1123
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:15,135
- [Alice] No, I know...
- ...they ask us to respect.

1124
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:16,971
You know how dangerous it is.

1125
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,139
We are not going backwards.

1126
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:21,643
We're pushing forwards, yes?

1127
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:23,978
We move!

1128
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:27,080
- You stole from Dr. Collins?
- Because Margaret can't be okay!

1129
01:07:27,147 --> 01:07:29,784
Get a hold of yourself, Alice!

1130
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:32,185
You are behaving like a child.

1131
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:33,721

01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,502
[laughs]

1204
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:03,270
- He liked that.
- No, he didn't.

1205
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:05,173
- [Peg] Where's your drink?
- [Alice] It's right here. Cheers!

1206
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:07,407
[Violet] Cheers.
It's a wonderful home.

1207
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:09,177
- How are you?
- Me?

1208
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:10,511
- I'm amazing.
- Mm-hm.

1209
01:10:10,578 --> 01:10:12,412
After the night Jack had,
I'm incredible.

1210
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,548
Right. Of course.

1211
01:10:13,614 --> 01:10:16,450
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

1212
01:10:16,517 --> 01:10:18,485
- You were a triumph last night.
- Oh! [chuckles]

1213
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:19,821
We haven't stopped talking
about you.

1214
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:21,421
You guys go now
and enjoy yourselves.

1215
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:24,357
I'm gonna go back
to the plates and finish up,

1216
01:10:24,424 --> 01:10:26,259
- and, um, I'll see you in...
- Can I help you?

1217
01:10:26,326 --> 01:10:27,762
- No, no, no, no, go.
- You sure? Okay.

1218
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:29,262
Promise. Go snoop.

1219
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,631
I love this record player.

1220
01:10:30,698 --> 01:10:32,100
- You do? You like it, Bill?
- I love it.

1221
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:33,868
At my house, I have a bench.
How did you get...

1222
01:10:33,935 --> 01:10:36,470
["Desafinado" playing
on record player]

1223
01:10:36,537 --> 01:10:38,371
[Peg] You can probably
tell by now

1224
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:41,175
that appetizers are where
I really express myself

1225
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,111
and buck convention.

1226
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:44,444
[Violet] It's a skill.

1227
01:10:44,512 --> 01:10:46,147
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1228
01:10:46,214 --> 01:10:47,749
Can't be taught.

1229
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:51,953
[humming melody]

1230
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:02,997
[Frank] I learned something
very exciting.

1231
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:05,032
[exhales]

1232
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,501
Oh, really? What's that?

1233
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:09,003
Rumor is you and Jack
are trying.

1234
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,772
Oh, well...

1235
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,507
- We'll see. [chuckles]
- Mm.

1236
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:14,909
Hope we'll see a little boy.

1237
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:16,844
[both laugh]

1238
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,018
[smacks lips] I'm sorry
Bunny didn't believe you.

1239
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:31,025
[Frank chuckles softly]

1240
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:37,698
But then again, you didn't
believe Margaret, so...

1241
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,569
why should anyone believe you?

1242
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,012
My God, you fascinate me.

1243
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,347
Because I've been waiting
for someone like you.

1244
01:11:54,414 --> 01:11:57,384
Someone to challenge me.

1245
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:01,889
No great man has changed
the course of history

1246
01:12:01,956 --> 01:12:05,693
without being pushed
to the limits of his potential.

1247
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:08,029
And you push me.

1248
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:11,532
Yeah.

1249
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:14,401
[chuckles lightly]

1250
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:16,537
I do hope you keep going.

1251
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:29,684
And yet, here you are.

1252
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:32,954
Preparing dinner.

1253
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:36,924
Like a good girl.

1254
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:42,530
[chuckles softly]

1255
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:46,868
- [Jack] Sit.
- [Frank] Absolutely.

1256
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:48,302
[Violet] Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

1257
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,605
No, I hope it's a boy.
Thank you.

1258
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:52,340
- Can't get enough of 'em, right?
- [groans]

1259
01:12:52,405 --> 01:12:54,041
- [Violet laughs]
- Girls are hard. They are.

1260
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:56,409
- I'll be right there, all right?
- Thank you.

1261
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:00,480
You know, Alice tells me you're
a hell of a tennis player.

1262
01:13:00,548 --> 01:13:02,683
- Oh, she does?
- Is that right? Yeah.

1263
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,318
[Jack] She's being polite.

1264
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:05,987
[Frank] Well, we're looking
for some fierce competitors.

1265
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:07,755
If you're ever ready
to get out there, call me.

1266
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:09,590
I've heard about that backhand,
though, it's famous.

1267
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:11,525
[Frank] If you want a partner,
I'm yours, man.

1268
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:13,426
That's a lot of pressure.
I don't know if...

1269
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:15,029
Thank you.

1270
01:13:15,096 --> 01:13:17,064
[chatter stops]

1271
01:13:20,268 --> 01:13:21,836
[chuckles softly]

1272
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:26,807
I'm having the fish. I don't
know what you guys are having.

1273
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:28,643
- [chatter resumes]
- [clears throat]

1274
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:30,144
[Peter] Nice to see
a familiar face.

1275
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:32,079
[Bill] Um, so anyways,
those windows right there,

1276
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:33,514
the slatted windows?

1277
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:35,316
They're actually called
"jalousie" windows.

1278
01:13:35,383 --> 01:13:36,617
Did you know that?

1279
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:38,052
- You didn't know why.
- [Peter] Oh, boy.

1280
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:39,353
So, the etymology is...

1281
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,621
[in French accent]
..."jealousy."

1282
01:13:40,688 --> 01:13:41,856
And you say,
"Whose baby is this?"

1283
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,291
And they say, "It's your baby."

1284
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:45,026
And you say,
"How could that be?"

1285
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,459
And it is your baby.

1286
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,829
And I just do it every year.

1287
01:13:48,896 --> 01:13:52,033
- Violet, where are you from?
- [chatter subsides]

1288
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:55,036
- Pardon?
- I said, "Where are you from?"

1289
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,939
Philadelphia.

1290
01:13:58,005 --> 01:13:59,974
- Mm! I'm from Philadelphia!
- [laughing] Are you serious?

1291
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,742
- I didn't know that.
- I knew I liked you.

1292
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,878
[Alice] Most of the women here
are from Philadelphia.

1293
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:07,214
Or Baltimore. Or Chicago.

1294
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:08,448
I've noticed.

1295
01:14:08,516 --> 01:14:09,817
[Jack] Mm. Can I
get anyone anything?

1296
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:11,085
[Peg] I for one do not miss
the winters.

1297
01:14:11,152 --> 01:14:12,853
No, no, no.
I thrive in the sunshine,

1298
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,355
even though
I'm alabaster-skinned.

1299
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,824
I love the sunshine.
I love the beach.

1300
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:18,458
- [Peg] Mm.
- [Jack] She does.

1301
01:14:18,526 --> 01:14:19,994
What was the last beach
you went to?

1302
01:14:20,061 --> 01:14:21,362
[Peter] Oh, fun fact
about the beach.

1303
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:22,830
- I read this.
- Yeah?

1304
01:14:22,897 --> 01:14:24,265
Beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places

1305
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:26,033
in the whole world.

1306
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,802
- Just a sandbox of disease and...
- Peter! [chuckles nervously]

1307
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:29,136
Do not say "disease"
at the dinner table.

1308
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:30,771
[Peter] It's true.
They need to know.

1309
01:14:30,838 --> 01:14:34,208
I can probably guess.
Hilton Head? Cape Cod?

1310
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:35,743
Or the Jersey Shore?

1311
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:41,315
And we all honeymooned
in Sea Island,

1312
01:14:41,382 --> 01:14:44,585
or the Poconos,
or Niagara Falls.

1313
01:14:47,955 --> 01:14:50,091
I think those are popular
honeymoon destinations.

1314
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:52,360
- Expensive.
- Mm-hm. Beautiful, beautiful.

1315
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:54,595
Peter, you, uh... you haven't
finished your story.

1316
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:56,364
[Peter] Mm!
Bill over here's probably

1317
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,265
- one of the worst golf players...
- I'm sorry, Peter.

1318
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:01,102
I'm not quite finished. Violet,
where did you meet Bill?

1319
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,372
Well, we met on a train.

1320
01:15:04,438 --> 01:15:05,940
- To Boston.
- [Violet] To Boston.

1321
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:07,475
Yeah.

1322
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,710
- Yes.
- [both laughing]

1323
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:11,412
You dropped your ticket.

1324
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:14,615
And he bent down, picked it up,
gave it to you, right?

1325
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:16,917
It is, yeah.

1326
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:19,687
That's how Margaret met Ted.

1327
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,923
And Peg, am I right in thinking

1328
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:25,426
that's how Debbie McIntyre
met her husband?

1329
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:27,661
Yes, I am. That's how they met.

1330
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:29,930
- Yes, that's true. I'm jealous.
- [Frank] Is it?

1331
01:15:29,997 --> 01:15:31,098
- Honestly, it's such a sweet story.
- [Frank] Wow.

1332
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:32,700
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Frank laughs]

1333
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:33,534
Isn't that funny,
the way those coincidences...

1334
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:35,236
Incredible.

1335
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:36,470
[Alice] There are only so many
different stories we're told.

1336
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:39,006
We're told what we remember.

1337
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:41,609
Until...

1338
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:44,345
we try to remember things...

1339
01:15:44,412 --> 01:15:47,081
that they want us to forget.

1340
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:49,617
- Like Margaret.
- Alice...

1341
01:15:49,683 --> 01:15:52,920
No. Jack. It's okay.

1342
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:57,258
I'm curious to hear
where she's going with this.

1343
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,929
Frank is doing something to us.

1344
01:16:09,837 --> 01:16:12,139
Delusions, memory problems,
hysteria.

1345
01:16:12,206 --> 01:16:14,742
We saw these issues
with Margaret,

1346
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:16,977
and know that it's, uh,
completely curable.

1347
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:20,549
Dr. Collins prescribed you
a suite of medications,

1348
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:22,183
which you are
clearly not taking.

1349
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:23,250
The question is why...

1350
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:26,020
He's lying to us.
He's lying to all of us.

1351
01:16:26,087 --> 01:16:29,390
Bunny, your best friend,
is worried about you.

1352
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:30,891
She thinks that you need help.

1353
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,426
Is that why she's
not here tonight?

1354
01:16:32,493 --> 01:16:34,028
Because you didn't want
to be reminded of that.

1355
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:35,796
He's using you.
He's using all of us.

1356
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:37,765
Do you even know what
the Victory Project actually is?

1357
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:40,968
- Have you ever asked?
- Do you?

1358
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:43,237
Is that why you went out there?

1359
01:16:45,574 --> 01:16:47,608
To Headquarters?

1360
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,611
What?

1361
01:16:52,046 --> 01:16:53,614
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Alice...

1362
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:54,849
But you don't know
what he's doing.

1363
01:16:54,915 --> 01:16:56,585
[Frank] You wandered out
by yourself.

1364
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,085
You ignored every rule.

1365
01:16:58,152 --> 01:17:00,821
And she put all your lives
in danger.

1366
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,194
Yes, I did go out there

1367
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:08,996
and I went to Headquarters
and I saw what he's hiding.

1368
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:10,664
- [Frank] What I'm hiding.
- [Alice] He's lying to us.

1369
01:17:10,731 --> 01:17:12,266
- [Frank] Oh, dear.
- [Alice] He's lying to all of us

1370
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,767
about what the Victory Project
actually is.

1371
01:17:13,834 --> 01:17:14,603
- He's trapped us here.
- [Frank] Alice...

1372
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:15,836
Trapped?

1373
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:20,307
I hope no one feels trapped.
Do you feel trapped?

1374
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:21,342
Violet?

1375
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:24,845
- Peg?
- [awkward chuckle]

1376
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:28,449
This is your psychosis.

1377
01:17:28,517 --> 01:17:32,453
You are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment,

1378
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:34,822
yet you trust every day.

1379
01:17:35,557 --> 01:17:36,857
We all do.

1380
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:40,394
Tonight, you've trusted us
in your home.

1381
01:17:42,897 --> 01:17:45,332
Just like I trusted you
in my bedroom.

1382
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,377
Alice?

1383
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:57,878
Do you remember that?

1384
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:03,751
He's... he's trying
to create a world.

1385
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,753
- If you want to articulate your own argument...
- He's using us.

1386
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:08,856
- Try using your own words, Alice.
- He's using all of us.

1387
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:10,891
- In your own words!
- What's in this food?

1388
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,760
Let's talk about that!

1389
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:14,929
- Where did it come from? Huh?
- [Frank] Oh, I'm sorry, everyone.

1390
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:16,330
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just think about it.

1391
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:18,499
- I'm sorry, Violet.
- [Alice] Victory milk.

1392
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:20,401
- This is... this is an anomaly.
- [Alice] Victory meat. Victory eggs.

1393
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:21,835
- It doesn't usually happen.
- [Alice] It all comes from him.

1394
01:18:21,902 --> 01:18:23,704
She's very sick

1395
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:25,472
- and she will get the help that she needs...
- Everything we're told...

1396
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,508
- ...I promise you both.
- ...everything we are given

1397
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:27,542
comes from him!

1398
01:18:27,609 --> 01:18:28,842
And it's all about control.

1399
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:30,377
- It's all about control.
- [Frank Laughs]

1400
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:32,514
We wouldn't even...
He might be poisoning the food!

1401
01:18:32,581 --> 01:18:33,814
Enough!

1402
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:37,184
We come to your house,

1403
01:18:37,952 --> 01:18:39,220
we sit at your table,

1404
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:43,057
and you insult
and degrade my husband?

1405
01:18:43,123 --> 01:18:44,858
He invites you
to be a part of something

1406
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:47,194
as extraordinary as he is,

1407
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:50,764
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat,

1408
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:53,133
demanding answers
to questions you've made up.

1409
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:57,838
There's a pattern, isn't there?

1410
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:01,475
A pattern of selfish,
pampered whining.

1411
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:06,180
Or is it just a desperation
to be exciting?

1412
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:09,149
Hm?

1413
01:19:09,216 --> 01:19:11,318
Spitting in the face
of this opportunity.

1414
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:18,325
It's heartbreaking that your
sad, desperate paranoia

1415
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:20,494
could destroy
what we're trying to build.

1416
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:23,163
Hm?

1417
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,236
Well, I won't listen to your
pathetic ranting any longer.

1418
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,873
Frank, honey?

1419
01:19:33,675 --> 01:19:35,209
I'll be in the car.

1420
01:19:41,716 --> 01:19:43,917
- [clicks teeth]
- [door opens]

1421
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:45,986
- [sighing vocally] Well...
- [door closes]

1422
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:49,423
Jack, I think you may have
over served your wife.

1423
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:51,158
[chair scraping]

1424
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:53,894
[utensils clatter]

1425
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,195
[whispers] Thank you.

1426
01:20:06,874 --> 01:20:08,442
[door opens]

1427
01:20:11,579 --> 01:20:14,114
[sighing]

1428
01:20:15,849 --> 01:20:18,452
I was expecting
so much more from you.

1429
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:25,192
[fork clicks on plate]

1430
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:30,030
Good luck, Alice.

1431
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,902
Jack, let's talk.

1432
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:39,873
[door closes]

1433
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:45,412
[moaning angrily]

1434
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:04,599
[record crackling]

1435
01:21:09,136 --> 01:21:13,273
[door opens, shuts]

1436
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:40,300
Did you enjoy yourself tonight?

1437
01:21:40,367 --> 01:21:42,035
What?

1438
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:44,204
No, I didn't
enjoy myself tonight.

1439
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:47,374
You planned a whole evening
to sabotage me.

1440
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:52,446
No! No, I would never
do that to you.

1441
01:21:52,514 --> 01:21:55,149
I would never do that to you.
I love you.

1442
01:21:57,251 --> 01:22:00,354
I'm trying...
I'm trying to save us.

1443
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:03,991
You're trying to save us
by going out there.

1444
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:08,763
Yes, because I saw
a plane crash. I told you.

1445
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:13,835
But, Jack, everything I said
at that table is true.

1446
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:15,537
Frank even admitted it to me.

1447
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:17,471
He admitted it to me
in the kitchen.

1448
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:20,608
That's why I did that. That's
why all of that happened.

1449
01:22:20,675 --> 01:22:21,975
He wouldn't have done that.

1450
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:28,282
[deep, shaky breaths]

1451
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:32,186
Jack...

1452
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:34,656
Everyone is acting
like I'm crazy.

1453
01:22:35,924 --> 01:22:37,991
And I'm not crazy.

1454
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:42,329
And I need you to listen to me.

1455
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:47,301
I need you to listen to me.

1456
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:53,106
Hey.

1457
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:57,211
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1458
01:23:03,918 --> 01:23:05,553
To me...

1459
01:23:07,856 --> 01:23:09,223
you are...

1460
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:12,292
you are bigger than all of this.

1461
01:23:15,062 --> 01:23:16,330
Mm-hm.

1462
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:20,067
You are bigger than Victory.

1463
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:22,604
You are bigger than Frank.

1464
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:26,173
I believe in you.

1465
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,108
I believe in <i>you.</i>

1466
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,447
I don't believe in him.

1467
01:23:35,315 --> 01:23:37,117
[whispers]
And I don't trust him.

1468
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:40,722
And I don't trust this place.

1469
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:47,294
And I don't want
to be here anymore.

1470
01:23:50,999 --> 01:23:53,133
I don't want to be here anymore.

1471
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,636
And we need to leave.

1472
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:00,708
[sniffles] We need to leave.
And we can go anywhere.

1473
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:03,477
We can go anywhere and we can
create our own world,

1474
01:24:03,545 --> 01:24:05,747
and it will be you and me
and we'll be okay.

1475
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:09,182
And it's not about where we go,
it's just that we're together.

1476
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:14,522
Please? Please? Please?

1477
01:24:19,627 --> 01:24:20,828
Please?

1478
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:26,568
[whispering] Please.

1479
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:29,537
Okay.

1480
01:24:29,604 --> 01:24:31,104
[light gasp]

1481
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:35,075
- Okay?
- [breathing deeply]

1482
01:24:36,678 --> 01:24:38,613
[sniffles] Okay.

1483
01:24:43,051 --> 01:24:44,519
[voice trembling] Okay?

1484
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,755
- Okay.
- [sighs in relief]

1485
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:54,662
[whimpering]

1486
01:24:58,332 --> 01:25:00,568
I love you. I love you.

1487
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:03,605
But we need to go tonight.

1488
01:25:03,671 --> 01:25:05,873
We need to go.
We can't be here.

1489
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,308
- [sniffles]
- Hey. Hey.

1490
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:11,613
[sniffles]

1491
01:25:14,147 --> 01:25:16,149
[both chuckle faintly]

1492
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:21,188
[whispering] I love you.
Let's go.

1493
01:25:21,254 --> 01:25:22,757
I love you.

1494
01:25:24,358 --> 01:25:26,561
- Okay.
- 'Kay. Okay.

1495
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:35,637
[sniffles]

1496
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:50,484
- [door shuts]
- [Alice] Jack?

1497
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:53,655
I packed us a snack in case
we drive all night long,

1498
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:56,323
but I think I packed everything.

1499
01:25:57,592 --> 01:25:58,760
Let's go.

1500
01:26:03,463 --> 01:26:06,199
Baby, let's go. Come on.

1501
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:08,268
[sniffs] I'm sorry.

1502
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:11,773
What?

1503
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:15,543
I love you so much, Alice.

1504
01:26:17,444 --> 01:26:18,813
Baby, what's wrong?

1505
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,415
I tried so hard
to keep this from happening.

1506
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:24,686
- What? Let's...
- Please believe...

1507
01:26:24,752 --> 01:26:26,286
Baby, we need to go.
We need to go.

1508
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:29,123
Baby, you need to drive.
We need to go. Go. Whoa.

1509
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:31,959
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. No! No!

1510
01:26:32,026 --> 01:26:34,696
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alice.
- No, Jack, please! I can be better!

1511
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:36,798
- I can be better! I'm so sorry!
- Alice, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1512
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:38,298
- Let me be better, please!
- I'm sorry!

1513
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:39,499
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Baby, please!

1514
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:40,768
- Let me be better.
- I'm sorry!

1515
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:42,170
- Get off me!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1516
01:26:42,235 --> 01:26:43,270
- Let me be better!
- I'm sorry.

1517
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:45,472
- I'm so...
- Jack, please!

1518
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:50,111
- They're hurting me! No! No!
- [sobbing]

1519
01:26:50,178 --> 01:26:54,015
No! Jack! They're hurting me!

1520
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:55,817
They're hurting me!

1521
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,284
Fuck!

1522
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:00,955
[sobbing]

1523
01:27:01,022 --> 01:27:02,623
Fuck!

[crying]

1525
01:27:18,973 --> 01:27:23,243
No, please, please.
Please, don't...

01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,780
[faint, high-pitched whining]

1527

No, you need to leave.

No. This world isn't real.
