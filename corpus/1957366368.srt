[muffled gunshots]

905
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:35,500
[gunshots continue]

906
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:52,833
[yelling]

907
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,250
[groaning]

908
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,125
[dramatic music playing]

909
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,125
[Varrick] Bravo, Kate.

910
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,166
Never doubted you.

911
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,208
Ani…

912
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,166
[whimpers] I'm sor...

913
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,708
Ani, I'm sorry.

914
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:51,333
[voice breaking]

915
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:53,708
I'd do anything…

916
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,041
To undo it, to take it all back.

917
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:00,750
[Varrick] Can't go back, sadly.

918
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:02,291
[Kate] Please.

919
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,875
Be nice, right now,
for both of us, wouldn't it?

920
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:08,625
Ani, I'd give anything to take it back.
I'd take it all back. I'm so sorry.

921
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:12,166
[Varrick] But guess we gotta just accept
who we are now.

922
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,541
And you know, Kate, that we are…

923
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,541
Tools.

924
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:22,041
Well, I was gonna say
"indispensable parts of a system."

925
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,291
That you created and controlled.

926
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:27,208
[Varrick] A necessary system, Kate.

927
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:30,041
One that cannot accommodate dissent.

928
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,750
I promise you
it is not what you think it is.

929
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,958
It turns out nothing ever was.

930
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:42,833
[footsteps approaching]

931
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:44,750
And I'm not looking away anymore.

932
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,000
Oh.

933
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,208
{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

934
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:58,291
[in English] I see. In the 25th hour,
you suddenly grew a conscience.

935
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:01,333
Don't do this, Varrick.

936
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,291
[Varrick] Don't you do this, Kate.

937
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:07,916
My entire fucking life,
I never loved anyone, except you.

938
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,291
Come on, V.

939
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,125
We both know you only love yourself.

940
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,208
Life had such…

941
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,875
Big things waiting for you.

942
01:32:28,208 --> 01:32:29,791
My life wasn't mine.

943
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,541
Till now.

944
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:45,208
[tense music rises]

945
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,666
[Kate groaning]

946
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,708
It's okay. It's okay. Go on. Okay.

947
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,666
[Ani crying]

948
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,083
Great shot.

949
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:20,458
[breathing heavily]

950
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,250
[sighs]

951
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,458
[Varrick exhales]

952
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,750
[groans]

953
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:57,000
[Ani] I got you.

954
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:03,875
[panting]

955
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:14,708
[Kate struggling to breathe]

956
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,583
Hey, hey.

957
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,083
Yeah. It's okay.

958
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,583
I know you.

959
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:57,208
No, no, no. [sobbing]

960
01:34:57,291 --> 01:35:00,375
[slow mournful music playing]

961
01:35:01,916 --> 01:35:04,333
[heartbeat slowing]

962
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,125
- It's okay.
- [exhales]

963
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:34,875
[heartbeat stops]
