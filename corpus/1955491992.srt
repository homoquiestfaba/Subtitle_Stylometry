Subtitled by: william2568

2
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,330
You know how I came up with the idea of Triple-X program?

3
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,930
Skateboards and swimming pools.

4
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,690
Augustus Gibbons Founder of the XXX Program

5
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,420
Single-handedly Stopped World War 3

6
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,370
Skateboards used to be stuck on the ground, unless in transportation.

7
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,080
In 1977 habits.

8
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,650
A big drought hit southern California.

9
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,880
Got so bad that rich urbanites could not afford to fill their swimming pools.

10
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,660
That's when the light clicked on. Some kid figured it out ...

11
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,930
He could escape these empty pools and get some real nasty air

12
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,940
Dogtown and Z-Boys. Have you seen it? It is a movie.

13
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,910
Does not matter.

14
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,210
Anyhow, our hero starts doing things on a board ...

15
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,730
and no one had ever seen.

16
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,460
Things the world thought were impossible.

17
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,300
Now that kid needed it, that draught.

18
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,820
The world needed those empty pools.

19
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,550
That's why Triple-X.

20
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,940
NEYMAR JR. XXX Active RECRUIT OF A GENIUS WITH BALL at his feet

21
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,930
Scored 100 goals by age 20

22
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,070
THOUGHT he was being recruting for THE AVENGERS

23
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,240
Do you feel safer today than you felt yesterday? I know I do not.

24
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,620
The biggest, most expensive military in the world ...

25
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,080
and we are still scared the shoes and tiny whitey bombs at the airport.

26
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
Why is that?

27
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,200
Beacuse the soldiers are built to take orders and fight in wars.

28
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,170
But we, my friend, are not at war.

29
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,000
We are at peril.

30
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,620
That's why Triple-X.

31
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,270
What's matter? You are on a diet? You're not hungry?

32
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,450
It's 7:30 in the morning.

33
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,940
So? It's lunch or dinner time somewhere in the world. Come up! Eat up!

34
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,310
You know who does feel safe? The man in charge. The world beaters.

35
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,490
The top chief par excellence ayatollahs with all the dollars.

36
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,320
And that's because those righteous bastard somewhere along the way ...

37
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,680
made a deal with the devil. They traded liberty for safety. And us ...

38
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,300
we the people

39
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,860
ended up losing both. That's why Triple-X.

40
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,190
While anybody else is stuck on the ground ...

41
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,880
we're doing shit on the board nobody's even seen before

42
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, that's my pitch

43
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,120
I've always worked as spy better than a salesman

44
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,440
So, what do you say?

45
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,310
I'm not a hero. I'm just a footballer.

46
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,010
My bad.

47
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,160
So I leave you be there.

48
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,770
Who says that there is no such thing as free, meal

49
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,170
Down on the ground! Now! Give me the money!

50
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,970
Do not move!

51
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Hurry up!

52
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,760
Goal!

53
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,150
And you say you're no hero.

54
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,490
I gotta call bullshit on that!

55
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,180
You're exactly the kind of hero the world needs.

56
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,720
At the end of the day, it comes down to the same question ...

57
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,510
I've been asking my wife every Friday night for the last 20 years.

58
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,870
Do you want some of this?

59
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,720
Or you just gonna...?

60
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,030
Return of the Xander Cage

61
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,980
CIA HEADQUARTERS NEW YORK CITY

62
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,440
access granted

63
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,040
Okay you may sit.

64
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,780
Gentlemen...

65
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,240
This is the device that crashed the satellite and killed Gibbons.

66
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,690
Nerds in the lab had coined it "Pandora's Box".

67
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,880
My team backtracked satellite's last signal input to Miami.

68
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,740
Some assholes leading the high life at the Ritz-Carlton pentahouse...

69
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,360
thought he could hold the world ransom.

70
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,280
Three flashbangs, two bullets and one body back later ...

71
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,050
we took custody of the device.

72
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,220
We must have over hundreds redundancies in place...

73
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,520
to prevent some punk with a laptop from hijacking satellites.

74
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,850
And Pandora's Box can bypass them all of them.

75
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,940
With of a push a button, it can eavesdrop on secured communications ...

76
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,440
corrupt military software, transmit false intelligence or ...

77
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,460
crash a satellite out of the sky like a goddamn tactical warhead.

78
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,280
One of you is behind this.

79
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,280
I am not leaving until I find out who.

80
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,390
You fight me with a book?

81
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,230
Here you go, brother! Chapter 1!

82
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,530
Page One!

83
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,700
Sheer habits.

84
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,990
You were late!

85
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,710
Just in time, boss.

86
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,100
They busted in here, step on our throats ...

87
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,110
and take the one device that can cause a global power shift.

88
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,550
So how do we get it back

89
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,450
These assholes just took our best of the best like they were in a Sunday brunch.

90
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,990
We need someone who move like them, fight like them.

91
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,300
We need someone who can walk into a tornado ...

92
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,680
and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.

93
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,220
Do you know someone like that?

94
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,490
No.

95
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,450
But Gibbons did.

96
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,170
DEFCON 1

97
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,200
Get down from there! What are you doing?

98
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Xander!

99
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Gracias, senor.

100
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,540
And here we go! We are on the way!

101
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,800
I knew you would do it, Xander. You brought the world to us.

102
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,780
The world is big, but always fits in your heart.

103
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,880
Take it with you always

104
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,350
Now, go, go.

105
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,170
Of course Xander Cage could pay the satellite company ...

106
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,120
just like a regular guy

107
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,730
What?

108
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,530
And line the pockets of some boardroom billionaires?

109
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,180
You know

110
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,970
These days, a regular guy can't afford to be a regular.

111
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,030
- Up. - Let's go.

112
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,200
Rule 1 Don't fall.

113
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,510
Santo Domingo. Dominican Republic.

114
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,660
Is the world getting smaller?

115
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,460
I know the feeling.

116
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,900
Running from your problems never works out.

117
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,700
You need a new plan.

118
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,260
I need a new map.

119
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,930
Do not say I did not warn you.

120
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,390
Oh boy.

121
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,270
Here we go again.

122
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,880
Get down. Do not move asshole

123
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,890
On your knees now, you son of bitch!

124
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,290
I want to comply, I really want to comply but you're confusing me.

125
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,030
"Do not move, asshole". "On your knees you son of bitch" Which is it?

126
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,210
- You have three seconds to comply! - You're not good at this.

127
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,310
One!

128
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,710
Two

129
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,680
Okay!

130
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,440
Come out, Frankesnstein!

131
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,460
Gibbons! Gibbons?

132
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,950
Olly, olly, oxen free.

133
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,300
You really do look different, Gibbons.

134
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,180
Did you lose weight?

135
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,500
Augustus always had such...well

136
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,270
not excatly nice things to say about you.

137
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,280
When did you realize it was all fake?

138
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,910
You mean the clown show?

139
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,710
You had a guy over there wearing thousand dollars beats...

140
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,070
where you can buy a knock-off for half the price.

141
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,840
Or the lady that was running to catch a bus that doesn't leave for two hours.

142
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,510
Or the security guard over there buying a soda with foreign currency?

143
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,690
You know what the kicker was?

144
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,700
Clearence from "It's a Wonderful Life".

145
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,420
You know the nice old man who sat down next to me with the bag of bombs?

146
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,390
Just happen he knows I spoke English.

147
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,160
Go figure.

148
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,870
- Bullets could have been real. - And the body armour would have been real.

149
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,460
I do not know you, but I don't like to be tested.

150
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,780
Gibbons never believed you were dead. He never stopped looking for you.

151
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,780
- Hell of a friend. - Yeah. Well, the joke's on him.

152
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,850
- Because we were never friends. - Trust me, he is not laughing.

153
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,860
Nor will he ever again for that matter.

154
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,090
I had never seen anything like it.

155
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,970
This group is lethal, and they do not care who or what gets it their way.

156
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,250
I was hoping you will be interested in headlining the next five card.

157
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,410
30 feet across, 90 feet down.

158
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,750
3 inches security glass?

159
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,900
No ropes, no line, no parachute.

160
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,080
I bet they had a blast.

161
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,960
We ran facial identification on every database in the world. Nothing.

162
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,520
Not even a match on a speeding ticket.

163
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,020
They are ghosts, in a day and age where

164
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,610
that kind of thing's almost impossible.

165
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,470
Okay

166
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,240
You get that I do not work for suits.

167
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,320
What makes you think I want to ruin all my life for?

168
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,450
No...

169
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,330
if you do not want do it for me ...

170
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,750
do it for Gibbons.

171
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,700
Your country needs you. Mr. Cage. The Triple-X program needs you

172
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,710
It's time to be a patriot.

173
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,080
By whose definition?

174
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,880
Last time I was patriotic, I got three strikes.

175
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,030
And there was only one man who believed in the underdog.

176
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,220
Patriotism is dead. There are only rebels and tyrants now.

177
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,040
So which are you?

178
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,140
I am Triple-X.

179
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,940
Welcome back, Triple-X.

180
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,520
Where are you going?

181
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,340
- London. - Why? What's in London?

182
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Ghosthunter.

183
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,310
And possibly a fur coat.

184
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,870
I have forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.

185
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,330
Oh, see you found your coat.

186
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,920
Oh you promise take care of it for me

187
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,570
And I did

188
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,590
I'm looking for someone.

189
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,490
Since when did we have a business relationship?

190
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,310
You know, I get caught even touching a computer, my hour is up for 20.

191
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,780
Name your price.

192
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,530
You know I'm good for it.

193
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,650
Information like this doesn't have a price.

194
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,650
Ainsley, everything has a price.

195
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,680
Now, if you don't think you can pull it off,

196
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,860
if you'd lost your edge, just tell me and I'll understand.

197
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,740
You know what it is, Cage?

198
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,970
What?

199
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,770
I used to think you are the man

200
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,470
But now...

201
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,150
I do not know, maybe I feel that you're working for him

202
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,240
Come on

203
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,570
Nobody knows I'm here.

204
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,350
And you know how I am about keeping secrets.

205
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,590
So you say, but Interpol got these listening bugs.

206
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,420
I mean, they're practically invisible, real MI-6 kind of shit.

207
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,040
Disappear under your skin, underarms ...

208
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,630
tied around your balls like a Christmas bow.

209
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,260
unwrap me, then

210
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,990
You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins ...

211
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,980
nine out of ten relationships.

212
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,040
Lucky for me, you love to gamble.

213
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,450
Of course

214
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,050
not.

215
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,420
My friends on the other hand, adores the ***

216
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,460
***

217
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,930
The things I do for my country.

218
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,410
Like finding needles in a stack of needles.

219
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,780
Even though you are shackled by the queen...

220
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,040
you're still the best of the world.

221
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,430
Thank you.

222
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,960
Do yourself a favor. Burn this.

223
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,720
The words that I hear out in the streets, these ghosts caused real kind of trouble

224
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,490
They got training and they got funding ...

225
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,570
and they've got no problem running over anyone who gets in their way.

226
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,300
I can see you worry that I may get hurt.

227
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,310
I worry that you might get dead.

228
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,860
You know, I'm touched you can't imagine a world without me in it.

229
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,950
It would be less fun.

230
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,480
That's all I'm saying.

231
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,790
Your ghosts are hanging out in Philippines.

232
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,150
Figures they go to the Pacific.

233
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,850
Some jungle rave that's off the grid.

234
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,210
How the hell did you find them so quickly?

235
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,250
Undercover work.

236
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,330
Where is it? What did you do with Pandora's Box?

237
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,000
It's in a safe place.

238
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,340
That was not part of the plan.

239
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,570
After all these years, you are still shocked when I improvise?

240
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,120
No. But the mission was to destroy it.

241
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,220
It turns out there's a new mission.

242
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,970
I am not going to destroy the one thing that I can use to get what we want.

243
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,120
- The world is looking for us, Xiang! - Let them come!

244
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,240
You are worried about pawn sacrifice.

245
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,550
I get my eye on the king.

246
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,850
That's the problem.

247
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,890
You forgot the queen.

248
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,540
Royal Air Force Station Lakenheath, United Kingdom

249
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,400
After your success taking down Anarchy 99, Gibbons was handed a blank check.

250
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,740
Which is the long way of saying ...

251
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,910
he got you a new ride

252
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,050
The world went to another place since your death Cage.

253
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,520
On board drones, anti-air countermeasures ...

254
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,830
and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times ...

255
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,630
without even landing.

256
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,330
You can check your coat. I promise you no one will dare steal it.

257
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,940
I can guarantee it can't walk off on its own.

258
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,590
Wheels up in ten, boys! which means you are already 7 minutes behind.

259
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,650
Is she always so much fun or just on special occasions?

260
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,970
No wonder our country in debt trillions of dollars.

261
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,530
Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?

262
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,400
We do not need any of it.

263
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,610
But it make catching more fun.

264
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,420
Xander Cage! Holy shit!

265
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,440
Live concert in one night only. This is crazy!

266
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,750
I was at Coachella and Guns N'Roses got back together.

267
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,090
but this is way cooler

268
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,480
Well, I was not actually there, but ...

269
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,240
I heard about it, you know?

270
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
I'm so talking. Oh my God.

271
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,750
Sorry, it's a bad habit. I get started and then ...

272
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,150
- I can not stop and I can not ... - Breathe.

273
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,260
Take your time. I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.

274
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,720
Are you kidding me with those guns?

275
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,790
You look like the fucking Terminator!

276
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm not talking about the first Terminator ...

277
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,890
but the second Terminator goes back to kill the first terminator.

278
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,430
It is the liquid metal guy.

279
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,600
Agent Claridge worked closely with Gibbons. She will handle support for the operation.

280
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,160
And a guy like you needs a lot of support.

281
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,610
What are you like? 220? 230?

282
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,950
Be honest. 250 is the hardest max for my swing.

283
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,640
- Oh come on. - I'm kidding.

284
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,670
It's not like I have a safe word or anything, it is "kumquat".

285
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,850
I never really think about it.

286
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,150
kumquat

287
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,890
What about you?

288
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,380
"Not safe" isn't in my vocabulary.

289
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,980
Touche, you're the Xander Cage.

290
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,060
Anything you need, Becky can source it within an hour.

291
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,240
Except for any sort of illegal drugs.

292
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,210
Those I'll have in 15 minutes.

293
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,490
Kidding.

294
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,660
But if you need a *** of purple ***, I'm not the girl to ask.

295
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,830
Okay, Cage, follow me. I'll introduce you to your ground team.

296
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,420
- Thank you, Becky. - Of course.

297
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,740
kumquat

298
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,860
Here comes the Red Bull freak show.

299
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,870
Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul...

300
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,490
Donovan.

301
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,560
Captain Paul Donovan.

302
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,950
I know you. I saw you on TV.

303
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,480
The president gave him a medal. It must be pretty cool, right?

304
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,920
You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.

305
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,790
must have seen a lot.

306
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,340
I wonder:

307
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,090
How many have ever pulled a free-style triple back flip?

308
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,430
On a BMX bike before? All of you?

309
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,440
No, we do not play on bicycles.

310
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,100
Oh, you do not play on bikes?

311
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,170
any of you ever carved an R4

312
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,060
On a snowboard ...

313
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,770
while an avalanche is on your booty?

314
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,210
We're soldiers, hotshot, not slackers.

315
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,100
Okay, but you all ...

316
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,220
have HALO jumps over Eastern Europe ...

317
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,520
using a standard-issued armor dempolyed parachute system. Am I right?

318
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
No.

319
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,110
We're not all jack up on Mountain Dew and Red Bull, you asshole.

320
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,240
Where did you find this guy?

321
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,160
Oh there is the first time for everything.

322
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,800
What did you just do? I can not believe this shit.

323
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,880
I am not gonna have clowns watch my back.

324
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,590
I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?

325
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,410
You know no one has this number.

326
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,440
So what do you up to these days?

327
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,600
Me? Moving in odds.

328
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,610

Why don't we just nuke this bitch in oil bean and car, eh?

355
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,770
Pandora's Box is one of a kind

356
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,730
It needs to be recovered intact.

357
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,130
Why? What does it do?

358
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,580
- Brainwave scrambler? - It killed Gibbons.

359
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,480
All you need to know. The rest is classfied.

360
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,710
Brainwave scrambler

361
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,110
Do you smell that?

362
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,400
It smells like the same shit in a different suit.

363
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,330
You think a dog knows how to work "Frisbee"?

364
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,920
The master says "fetch," and the bitch listens.

365
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,680
You'd look so sexy with a Frisbee in that mouth.

366
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,220
Sweetheart, this is not a game.

367
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,150
You're all my soldiers now.

368
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,230
- I'm not a soldier, I'm a parlour. - Do we look like soldiers?

369
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,930
Oh hell no.

370
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,210
- I drop your soldiers over Eastern Europe. - Why did you leave lassie behind?

371
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,250
This is my operation! You will listen to me.

372
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,820
The meeting is over.

373
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,990
Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln ... how was the play?

374
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,590
That's super strength body armor.

375
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,340
We got to tighten the belt ...

376
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,470
Over here.

377
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,200
I got this on.

378
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,410
What are you, my handler?

379
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,190
I am whatever you need.

380
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,480
I can handle anything.

381
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,390
And I got a tight grip.

382
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,970
And just for you know, I'm not a field agent.

383
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,100
I do not go out in the field. Ever.

384
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,330
That's where all the fun is.

385
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,080
Fun scares me.

386
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,190
People scare me, guns scare me.

387
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,440
People with guns really scare me, If I'm scared I can not do my job.

388
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,590
And if I can't do my job, then people die. And if people die, who does my tech supporting?

389
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,220
Literally no one.

390
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,830
But I'll make sure to keep you safe.

391
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,790
It ain't easy to keep me safe.

392
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,800
Yes, these badboys are my favorites.

393
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,190
They called Exogloves . *** new ground combat initiative.

394
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:36,100
pneumatic pistons drive the gears. qualdruple the speed, and power of the punches.

395
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,470
No no.

396
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,560
This is a multi-stage signal disrupter

397
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,060
It is very, very breakable

398
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,420
Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash?

399
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,630
Of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?

400
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,570
Yes.

401
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,670
You're one of them, right?

402
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,110
Hey easy. Rocky.

403
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,940
I wasn't kidding when I say it because the force of these badboys

404
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,360
to cut a hole in a fucking plane.

405
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,070
Keep walking around. What can possibly go wrong?

406
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,660
- That's my style, though. - Yes, good. glad to hear.

407
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,650
You know? Actually...

408
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,620
I would rather if you...

409
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,890
That's refreshing. You actually know what you are doing down there.

410
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,790
Yes, that's what she said.

411
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,170
Caramoan Islands PHILIPPINES

412
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,070
Let them pass.

413
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,700
Need something, man?

414
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,830
I heard this is a perfect place to disappear for a few days ...

415
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,230
for my crew, no questions asked

416
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,010
My home is your home, if you pay good price.

417
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Perfect.

418
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,770
Tennyson!

419
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,610
Figure you like this. I just happen to have the best *** in the South Pacific.

420
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,560
30% of the top gets you a finest hospitality package.

421
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,260
30% of the top? Can I get the girls for a weekend and two coconuts?

422
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Ten percent.

423
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,160
10%?

424
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,480
I think looking the other island without laws, it happens all the time.

425
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,370
I'll tell you what to do. You turn around, go get your boat. You kiss my ass.

426
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,170
It's okay. Hanging on.

427
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
What do you think?

428
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,370
You talked me into it!

429
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,240
Eighteen percent!

430
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,990
You think this is a flea market?

431
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,580
You think we neighborhoods sell televisions and fake watches or something like that?

432
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,550
What's wrong with you, friend?

433
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,990
All right. 22.5%.

434
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,620
How do I give the half?

435
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,130
Twenty two...

436
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,810
and a half.

437
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,720
Hi man. Enjoy the party.

438
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,310
I like your style, man.

439
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,350
Stay on that boat, no matter what.

440
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,980
Adele, Nicks!

441
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,360
Well, guys, keep your ear bugs in.

442
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,020
Like always, Adele, you're my eyes in the sky.

443
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,690
Nicks, you are gonna show how we did.

444
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,910
You got this?

445
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,350
You just watch.

446
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,070
Can you keep this behind the bar, please?

447
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,740
What can I get you?

448
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,070
A cranberry club soda.

449
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Make that two.

450
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,430
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

451
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,930
Stay focus.

452
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,970
Really?

453
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,240
Xander Cage. Back in action.

454
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,340
Did I ever leave?

455
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,120
Spot that clown.

456
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,340
Easier than we expected. Drinks all around.

457
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,010
That's him.

458
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,970
***. douche bag hunting season.

459
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,450
my favorite.

460
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,080
It is too early in the evening to slay someone.

461
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,340
- Let me fix it. - Oh come on.

462
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,000
The *** doesn't deserves a bullet? I think he does.

463
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Is this a party or a funeral?

464
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,700
Either way, somebody is going to hang up tonight!

465
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,970
Told you he was fun having around.

466
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,690
At first I thought Special Forces.

467
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,040
But your inks all wrong.

468
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,220
CIA?

469
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,680
They would send in a drone to bomb us to hell.

470
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,510
MI6?

471
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,750
You are not kind of subtlety they prefer

472
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,880
You know the men who come to this island. They're on the run.

473
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,370
Hiding from the world.

474
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,410
But not you.

475
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,820
You are not here to hide.

476
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,310
You're looking for someone.

477
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,990
Who says I haven't already find it?

478
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,850
Do you want to scare me?

479
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,060
a little tremble will be nice.

480
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,720
Well...

481
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,490
considering one tremble to make you run away from here...

482
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,350
I'd say I'm close enough.

483
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,290
Does this means you're not making any breakfast in the morning?

484
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,090
I'd say a couple of inches off.

485
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,820
Bit of a stalemate.

486
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,650
Not if you drop the gun

487
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,050
I'm not the bad guy.

488
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,700
I don't believe in good guys.

489
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,840
Serena?

490
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,800
Who is he?

491
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,390
We just met.

492
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,210
But we got along famously until somebody ...

493
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,480
decided to interrupt

494
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,170
stick to the path

495
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,270
Here honey

496
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,290
There are a lot of unmarked graves on the island.

497
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,990
And I'll bet whoever sold you that shirt is one of them.

498
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,540
How long do you intend to push a look?

499
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,080
Until I get what I came for.

500
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,030
which is what exactly?

501
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,270
A damn stiff drink.

502
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:24,150
So, let's be real and talk about what we all really want.

503
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,420
I am only here for that.

504
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,240
In my minds, you guys can walk away nicely. unless you want to continue our foreplay?

505
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,490
Power like that doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

506
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,240
Just improvising.

507
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,150
Seriously? A grenade? What is this? Eastern Europe in 1990s?

508
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,790
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.

509
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,630
So you are willing to kill?

510
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,430
Just to keep that for yourself?

511
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,270
That's a wrong question to ask.

512
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,240
What's the right question?

513
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,270
"Are you willing to die for it?"

514
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,630
One grenade, three people.

515
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,440
I like the odds.

516
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,050
Two grenades, three people.

517
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,120
I'm loving these odds.

518
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,070
Have you never bled so much that when you open your eyes, all you see is red?

519
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,980
When you have fought in wars on every continent.

520
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:50,560
Come on X, just say the word, Let me put both these two arseholes out in the pasture.

521
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,980
Except death.

522
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,140
Our bodies are such fragile.

523
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,540
Let me shoot him.

524
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,250
Death sometimes just...

525
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,760
sneak on you

526
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,300
It's been a while since I played hot potato.

527
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,110
I'm in a hospital bed.

528
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,170
I'm barely conscious, delirious. Drowning in my own blood.

529
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,840
And all I can hear myself to think is "Today is the day"

530
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,800
"Today is the day you die"

531
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,560
I'm touched.

532
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,510
Can I have my jacket?

533
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,760
There is a man comes along, tells me the story ...

534
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,980
about a drought in California.

535
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,040
About skateboards and swimming pools.

536
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,780
About a man named Xander Cage.

537
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,610
Oh shit. He is Triple-X.

538
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,460
I heard he was dead.

539
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,140
Is he?

540
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,710
We are all Triple-X.

541
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,640
We just have different agenda.

542
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,100
She wants to destroy it.

543
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,510
I'm going to use it.

544
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,690
And I will be damned if I am gonna let you take it back to NSA

545
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,570
Secret

546
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,630
Now it's a party.

547
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,930
Shit's about to go down.

548
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,640
You think that is for fun?

549
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,810
Turn off the music!

550
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,330
Stop it!

551
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,360
Everybody hands up!

552
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,650
Now!

553
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:10,910
On the floor!

554
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:15,300
First person to move, first person to die!

555
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,340
I moved.

556
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,650
I moved again.

557
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,330
I am still alive.

558
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,430
Shut up, "hero"!

559
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,670
All right.

560
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,840
Let's do this.

561
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,130
Do not move!

562
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,150
Well, I actually have what you want.

563
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,400
Pandora's box?

564
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,760
I got it right here.

565
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,800
But you're wrong though.

566
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:56,440
You take it from me, and you die first.

567
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,910
Then Lieutenant Leningrad, thinks he got you back

568
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,970
Then the two Ivans by the door.

569
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,780
Moscow Mule by the bar.

570
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:09,000
Then Igor on the stairs.

571
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,480
See where we are going with this?

572
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:14,940
But none of that matters.

573
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,880
Because like I said ...

574
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,700
if you take this from me, you die first.

575
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,740
I will take it from you, dead or alive.

576
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:32,170
If you hold it too tight, they cut your arm off.

577
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,070
Suit yourself.

578
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,420
Leningrad.

579
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:45,850
Hello Ivan.

580
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
The other Ivan.

581
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,050
Goodbye, Moscow Mule.

582
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,610
Igor. It's another one you owe me. X.

583
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,890
Read between the lines.

584
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,370
Tennyson! Some back will be nice.

585
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,510
Some back will be nice! Come on man!

586
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,430
X says I stay on the boat.

587
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:40,060
That was before the goddamn Russian invasion takes down ,man!

588
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,610
X says stay on the boat.

589
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,410
Do you want to play?

590
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,270
That doesn't belong in anyone's hands.

591
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,030
If you want it. Come and get it.

592
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,690
Was that necessary?

593
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,140
It's what Gibbons would have wanted.

594
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,880
X!

595
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,460
X.

596
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,190
It happened again. Another satellite fell.

597
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,630
How's working as a team?

598
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,060
That's what Gibbons would have wanted.

599
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,780
You in?

600
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,710
An explosion inside the Olympic Stadium rocks Moscow

601
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,580
Seven workers are now confirmed dead.

602
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,790
With at least 25 others injured in this senseless act of violence.

603
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,190
A source inside the Pentagon says ...

604
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,500
a rouge satellite may have been used as a weapon.

605
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,580
This means that Pandora's Box is not exactly classified.

606
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,220
In a new video, released just moments ago, an anonymous group ...

607
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,580
is claiming to have the ability to use satellites as weapons. They claimed

608
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,200
quote "The violation of civil liberties of all citizens of the world ...

609
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,630
It is an atrocity that must be stopped "

610
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:38,980
Disable and dismantle all the world spy programs within the next 24 hours ...

611
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,370
or I will do it for you one satellite at a time.

612
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:45,510
There are 30,000 satellites orbiting the Earth at this moment.

613
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,450
I will drop one satellite every 24 hours until my demands are met.

614
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,140
eyewitnesses in Moscow ...

615
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,140
- Was this always part of mission to you? - Of course not.

616
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,610
We were a new Triple-X team Gibbons created.

617
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:04,190
We discovered a high-level intelligence officer who was trying to manipulate satellites.

618
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,790
And even before we could unmask him

619
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,710
Gibbons was killed.

620
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,070
So you knew they were Triple-X all along

621
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,580
I needed you to retain a sense of objectivity.

622
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,860
I don't understand. If I destroyed Pandora's Box. What happened in Moscow?

623
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,200
If I am right, which I am ...

624
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,740
this box only had the ability to control one satellite.

625
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,290
What does that mean?

626
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,950
It means we have been chasing a prototype.

627
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,910
- And these guys have the real one? - Yes.

628
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,340
Serena played us like fools.

629
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:44,980
betrayed us.

630
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,780
This is not about Serena. This is a war.

631
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,610
And either we stop today or we watch the world burn tomorrow. can't lose focus on that.

632
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,510
Where were you have you been? You stopped ***

633
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:00,530
Your mom says hi.

634
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,080
tracker on board? Nobody saw you?

635
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,310
- No one ever sees me, boss - good.

636
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,690
These suits control every spy satellites in the sky.

637
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:14,300
But, how often these seven men all sit in the same room together?

638
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,050
Almost never

639
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,210
And if you needed retinal scans ...

640
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,220
cellphone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world...

641
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,830
Who would you target?

642
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:28,130
Shit

643
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,860
Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?

644
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,870
You're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage. I came looking for you, remember?

645
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,830
Oh, asshole.  We are going to have problems?

646
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,660
Oh no problem. How was your trip?

647
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,450
I'm just doing the maths.

648
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,760
Oh yeah? What maths?

649
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,190
Air velocity divided by distance.

650
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:55,440
So when I stuff you down the toilet, the search and rescue...

651
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,240
know where to find you between China and North Korea.

652
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,740
keep talking shit, man.

653
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,820
Hold that thought, GI Joe.

654
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,550
Roll it back

655
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,090
A little more.

656
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,280
more

657
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,330
A little more. stop.

658
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,130
Okay, when Xiang broke the window ...

659
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,400
He is the only one that did not flinch.

660
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,830
I need the president on the phone immediately

661
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,860
That's not gonna scrub off. You know that right? It was a quantum screen!

662
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:33,580
It seems that the director of the CIA has been trying to destroy the world for years.

663
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,370
We have carte blanche to track this son of bitch down

664
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,210
Do any of you know how to do it?

665
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,220
The same way Xiang and I found Pandora's Box in New York.

666
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:49,870
Pandora's box needs to be reconnecting itself because of the satellites orbit.

667
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,350
Excuse me.

668
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,560
All what we need to do is to track down the main signals.

669
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,740
and then we can approximate its location within a 20 mile radius.

670
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,440
Of all the places in the world ...

671
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,010
this fruit choose Detroit?

672
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:19,810
The blasts did take place in Moscow, but they were felt around the world.

673
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:24,230
In the morning, *** the death toll of Moscow's tragedy has rised.

674
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:30,750
Let me guess. Everyone's jumping at the chance to dismantle their spy program.

675
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,030
No.

676
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:37,190
The world is too stupid to realize that Moscow was a bluff.

677
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:43,970
Okay, Triple-X, you will base at an NSA safe house.

678
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:48,920
Becky will coordinate your bug communications, and have the signal disrupter on standby.

679
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,580
Mate, when I crashed the boat on shore to save your life ...

680
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,270
Whatever bro

681
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:59,410
Do you think that counts as crash #199 for me? You know, officially?

682
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,700
Officially, you're deranged

683
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:05,630
Cool.

684
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,080
We will set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city

685
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,700
When Becky locks in its exact location, we make our move.

686
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:16,360
What about you? How did you get involved in all this?

687
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,840
I dangled the skyscraper, and go to a year jail for it.

688
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,990
Jail?

689
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,160
Seems excessive.

690
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,840
The *** was 30 storeys tall.

691
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,280
Two million hits on YouTube.

692
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,600
And I served only half the sentence.

693
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,990
Let me guess. Gibbons to the rescue.

694
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,300
He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.

695
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,630
I got mine after I left NSA.

696
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,770
- What about that one your wrist? - London.

697
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,240
In 2009 climbed the Millennium Wheel.

698
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,270
Naked.

699
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,690
- Naked? - Yeah.

700
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,790
High school.

701
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,220
Oh no!

702
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,390
We all have our embarrassing moments.

703
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,480
What about that sexy one?

704
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,810
This? The phoenix out of the ashes.

705
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,110
18 hours in a chair in Mexico.

706
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,450
drank my body in tequila to get through it.

707
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,040
It is the most important one actually

708
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:30,730
It is when I decided to change the world instead of ...

709
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,650
rage against it.

710
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:40,590
We found him. We found Pandora's Box.

711
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,960
Xander, do you copy?

712
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,300
We are here. Okay, send Tennyson.

713
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,300
Looks like East 404, Congress streets. He is on the top floor.

714
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:58,800
SELECT SATELLITE

715
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,320
I'm sure activity with Pandora's Box. I can jam signal

716
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,720
but only a few minutes, so hurry.

717
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,260
You got to get there fast and take this guy down.

718
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,620
Not if we find him first.

719
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,120
Red light!

720
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,190
You know traffic signals are invented by big oil to waste fuel, drive up profits.

721
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:39,350
If I say "yes", would you please slow down? Look out!

722
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,900
Wait.

723
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,710
Is this the part where you anticipate, then you got your eye on me, you don't trust me?

724
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,650
Welcome to the moment.

725
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,940
Everyone needs back up.

726
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:09,720
Stop!

727
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,030
Stop!

728
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,450
Tennyson?

729
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:21,210
A gridlock.

730
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,590
There it is.

731
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,660
If you run into trouble ...

732
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,430
dial nine.

733
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,550
It is an old Gibbons fail safe.

734
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,700
You crashed my party! stole my dance partner!

735
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,990
I will crash yours.

736
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,290
Have fun.

737
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,950
This is not a party. This is a race.

738
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,050
- What the hell think you are you doing? - building a ramp.

739
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:23,680
Go go go.

740
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,330
out of car! get out!

741
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:07,530
- What are you doing? - Let's go!

742
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,460
He is trying to reconnect.

743
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,920
Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite. You have to hurry.

744
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,080
I have a plan.

745
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,230
Hold on!

746
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,030
"Hold on" is no goddamn a plan!

747
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,470
Hi.

748
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,040
Are you looking for someone?

749
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,870
That's 200!

750
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,670
Haha, come on.

751
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:31,360
No! Xander, you guys have to got to the top floor. He is trying to engage another satellite.

752
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,570
Hurry!

753
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,200
fish in the barrel

754
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,550
45 U.S.P

755
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,530
12 round mag.

756
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,370
five left

757
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,420
Three.

758
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,770
What the hell is going on out there?

759
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:45,770
Empty.

760
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,930
I got Xander in! Find the target, light them up.

761
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,570
Gibbons thought you'd be back.

762
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,780
To be the hero we needed.

763
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,230
you take the box to NSA

764
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,510
we are right back to where we started.

765
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,990
This is touching.

766
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,040
Gibbons would be proud to see you two working together.

767
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,460
walking out of here, Xander.

768
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,390
you wanna know secret?

769
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:00,780
You forgot to put deodorant on?

770
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,060
I killed Gibbons because he was a self-righteous prick.

771
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:07,820
Do you have a shot?

772
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,180
Adele, do you have eyes on the target?

773
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,850
I am switching to the thermal.

774
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:16,000
I was never going to stop downing satellites

775
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:21,190
no matter what happened, you know why, because this world has turned ...

776
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,500
Please, please tell me you have a shot

777
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,990
Damn it.

778
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,240
He has turned the heat up. I can't see shit

779
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,860
X, can't see you guys. thermal is not good.

780
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,910
- Right? - I lost them in the heat.

781
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:34,300
you want to see what's going on in this world?

782
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,320
- What are you gonna do about it? - easy.

783
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:43,310
X. Keep him talking. I still don't have a shot

784
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:47,520
We made it that way, people like Gibbons and two of you. And me.

785
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,660
We made it that way.

786
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:53,760
What's the point of getting up in the morning if you're not gonna reboot the world

787
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,170
right, okay, easy

788
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:58,530
There's a war out there, a world war for our survival.

789
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:01,050
You don't see it? Millions of people have died for nothing!

790
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,700
Read between the lines.

791
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,280
- Come on, isn't it right? - I'm going to be honest with you.

792
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,580
What has been bugging me this whole time

793
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,480
is you have got something stuck in between your teeth.

794
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,220
- What? What the hell are you talking about? - I'm serious.

795
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,630
What the hell is wrong with you?

796
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,180
Right ... there.

797
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Nice shot.

798
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,930
Was it ever a doubt?

799
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,000
Yes, I confess I had my doubts.

800
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,420
That's for talking shit about my friend Gibbons.

801
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:52,880
Xiang! Get on your knees! On your knees!

802
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:56,170
Hands! Hands!

803
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:58,080
On your knees! Now!

804
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,150
Just in time.

805
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,710
Watch out. Cage. keep this up, people might mistake you for one of the good guys.

806
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,550
Hey, Suit.

807
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,630
You got what you wanted.

808
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:22,200
We both know that he is not the bad guy.

809
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,020
You know who would we blame for Moscow?

810
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:28,210
Better a living terrorist than a dead company man.

811
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:29,980
See what I'm saying?

812
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,040
Let's go.

813
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,460
Back on the plane. I want wheels up in twenty.

814
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,800
Let's go boys.

815
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:42,910
We recover Pandora's Box.

816
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,850
They will send an extraction team to pick you guys up.

817
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,780
But they are taking Xiang.

818
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,440
And Serena ...

819
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:53,540
you don't hear from me, remember, dial 9.

820
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,750
X takes care of its own.

821
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,130
You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?

822
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,550
nice place. spacious, expensive.

823
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:12,950
Shut up.

824
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,700
Thank you, sir.

825
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,200
Yes, minimal casualties. Triple-X performed ...

826
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:30,000
beyond any reasonable measured expectation.

827
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,330
Let me guess.

828
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:49,000
That was my invitation to the Oval Office.

829
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:57,190
10 minutes ago, the Triple-X program was officially shuttered.

830
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:01,950
All active agents should be erased from record, and considered enemies of the state.

831
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:06,900
It is just never a good idea to point a gun on me.

832
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:15,610
NSA extraction teams normally armed like they invading Fallujah?

833
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,130
No, generally not. Watch the boys.

834
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,440
Shit.

835
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:26,890
Oh, it's happening, isn't it? They're going to shoot at us, aren't they?

836
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,570
- Let's go!

837
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,040
It's showtime.

838
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,820
I guess we are on the same team now.

839
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,260
Give me one.

840
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:39,960
You know me. Wind me up, pointing the right direction.

841
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,650
Let's go!

842
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:45,570
That shit is getting real! Does this happen when shit goes real?

843
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:46,960
What do we do?

844
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,250
Just with bullets on.

845
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,980
Sadly, the terriost activated Pandora's Box ...

846
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,850
one last time before we could stop him.

847
01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:00,690
you and your entire team lost in the blast along with the device itself.

848
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,520
If the world thinks Pandora's Box has gone

849
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,660
then they won't know we are using it to spy on them.

850
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,550
You're just another tyrant.

851
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:11,830
No. patriot.

852
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:14,090
Let me educate you on the difference.

853
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,790
Xander!

854
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,460
Xander!

855
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:28,650
They say it is the last great adventure, cage. Be sure send me a postcard.

856
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,420
- engines hot! - Oh right let's go!

857
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,720
Xander!

858
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,680
Xander Cage!

859
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,350
- Go, go! - Everybody spread out!

860
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:41,560
Take cover! Move!

861
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,360
There, take cover!

862
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,290
What a rush.

863
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,010
Damn, Becky, that's a body armor.

864
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,410
Hey, I told you that you got no manners.

865
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,400
Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?

866
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:32,820
Well

867
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:43,870
Serena.

868
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:45,730
We're a bit busy now!

869
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:50,010
Marke has got Pandora's Box. She is gonna drop a satellite on top of you.

870
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:53,660
She is going to drop a satellite on us!

871
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,910
Not if I jam the signal!

872
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,280
I need a power source!

873
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,020
Go!

874
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,010
Over there? By myself?

875
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,340
Go!

876
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,750
Cover me!

877
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,570
Hurry up! Over there!

878
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,690
I'll go low.

879
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:36,310
I'll go high.

880
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:39,060
See if we can find G.I. Joe.

881
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,680
Are you getting signal interference?

882
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,430
Shit.

883
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,790
Everyone needs back up, right?

884
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,790
Yeah, I guess.

885
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,110
Let's do this.

886
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,620
Nicks!

887
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,550
- I got a plan. - No!

888
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:53,360
No!

889
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,250
Listen, from now on, I make the plans, you act ***!

890
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,380
Oh shit.

891
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:11,310
Oh my god, this is fucking awesome!

892
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,230
What's wrong asshole? Why do you come back?

893
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:31,150
No, I just finally figure out that maths problem.

894
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:47,140
It's gonna take two flushes.

895
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,530
Oh shit, way too many. Let's get out of here.

896
01:26:58,850 --> 01:26:59,880
Get back

897
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,560
Oh shit

898
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,830
I don't want to die

899
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:13,490
Forward, push!

900
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,360
This is all we've got.

901
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:22,560
I am out of bullets! You got any?

902
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,580
No, nothing.

903
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:28,110
I am empty!

904
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,950
We go on three.

905
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:17,940
What's up?

906
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,540
Rock, paper, scissors ... grenade launcher.

907
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:27,920
Darius Stone.

908
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,040
DARIUS STONE XXX SINCE 2005

909
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,650
Former US Navy SEAL OFFICER

910
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:34,620
Spent last 11 YEARS WAITING FOR SOMEONE to Dial 9

911
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,880
Triple-X since 2005.

912
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,970
Thanks for the assist!

913
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:40,860
X takes care of its own.

914
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,100
You got to be kidding.

915
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,640
SELECT SATELLITE

916
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,690
We failed.

917
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,500
Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it headed towards us.

918
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,030
I'm gonna have to take it to kamikaze style.

919
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,450
Do not do it. It is suicide. Nobody could survive that fall.

920
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,880
Tell Nicks have that camera ready.

921
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,210
Low alto free fall, no chute and a big fireworks

922
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,740
They say it is the last great adventure.

923
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:32,190
Make sure send a postcard.

924
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,320
I live for this shit

925
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:14,330
Shit.

926
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:32,160
Nicks!

927
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,350
I hope you got that on camera.

928
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,540
If it ain't no video, it did not happen!

929
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:42,710
Oh, yeah. Hall of Fame right here, bro.

930
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,090
- You know, I could have done that, right? - Bullshit.

931
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,520
What happened to Marke?

932
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:53,520
The ground broke her fall.

933
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,880
Still you do not believe in good guys?

934
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:27,440
It is okay to feel a little bad.

935
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:35,530
How bad?

936
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:07,580
Now, that right there...

937
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,340
that was a hell of an entrance

938
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,310
That's a hell of car.

939
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,290
Gibbons told me to keep an eye on it.

940
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:20,280
He said I would know why when I need to know why.

941
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,630
now I know why.

942
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:26,290
It is exactly the way I left it.

943
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:28,240
took it on a date or two

944
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,510
X takes care of its own.

945
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:33,700
That's why I figured you'll come through.

946
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:37,270
To get a chance to work with the legendary Xander Cage?

947
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:39,200
Where do I sign up?

948
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:52,630
You know you pissed a wrong damn picnic

949
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,130
The whole world will be looking for us

950
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:02,250
I wouldn't have any other way.

951
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:40,820
We thought we could end with Augustus' favorite song.

952
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,510
That's an impressive trick.

953
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,640
Think you are the only one knows how to play dead?

954
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:50,530
Gotcha.

955
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:57,490
It's pretty surreal to be on my own funeral.

956
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,230
And I think to myself:

957
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:03,530
What a wonderful World

958
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:06,550
I love that song.

959
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,770
And it could be a wonderful world ...

960
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:13,290
if we stop doing bad shit to it.

961
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:18,680
If you wanted me out of retirement, you could have just asked, man.

962
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,910
You've always responded to less subtle motivation.

963
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:26,120
now what?

964
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,320
You keep being a rebel the world doesn't know it needs.

965
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,230
Watches the watchers, fight the enemy within.

966
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,320
Damn, that's so complicated.

967
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,600
Really?

968
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,500
Let me simplify for you.

969
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,820
kick some ass

970
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,470
Get the girl.

971
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:47,530
And try to look dope while you are doing it.

972
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:51,450
You can do dope, can't you?

973
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:54,550
Sure you can.

974
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,070
Junior, let's go!

975
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,460
I will see you there, X.

976
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:10,090
I can definitely make that work.

977
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,700
