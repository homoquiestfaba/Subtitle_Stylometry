00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,740
Rule number one,
my friend, never tell
anybody in the theater

530
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,608
anything you don't want
everybody else to know.

531
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,943
Sorry you had to learn
that the hard way.

532
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,845
(IN CHINESE ACCENT)
Oh, your face look
exactly like your ass.

533
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,580
(ALL LAUGHING)

534
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,683
Hey, isn't that
Mrs. Keene?

535
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,485
No, that's Earline,
her twin sister.

536
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,220
That's our costume designer.

537
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,055
Miss Keene has a twin?

538
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,025
Yeah, but nobody's
ever seen them in
the same place together,

539
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,727

Keep that down.

540
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,297

Peter, Earline.

541
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,598
Hi.
Take your pants off.

542
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,734
What?
Hey, Earl, we got
a schedule to keep.

543
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,069
Screw your schedule.
I got a schedule, too.

544
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,337
I'm up to my ass
in velvet here.

545
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,172

547
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,410
Iced tea would be fine.

548
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:36,147
I would rather drink pus
from a dead possum's eye.

549
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,382
All right, Pepsi then.

550

leaving me, are you?

She won't bite.

(IN MOCK DISBELIEF) No!

557
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,780
Hey, I'm looking for Michael.

558
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,881

you got dumped.

You are not costumed.

566
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,833
He has to be costumed.
He's just running the video.

567
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,601
He has to be costumed!
Like one of us?

568
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,837
No, he works behind
the scenes. He's a techie.

569
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,971
We don't have
time for this.

570
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,173
Just find something.
All right.

571
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,974
Can you run this?

572
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,976
I need to be asleep now.

573
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,179

running the video
got to be costumed?

it needs something.

Nine.

Okay, get that camera.

587
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,712
As everybody knows
from our adventures
one month ago,

588
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,816
our band kidnapped that
hack actor Ken Zorbell
from his own party.

589
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,651
You kidnapped
somebody? Why?

590
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,753
Revenge.

591
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,689
Well, there was two parties
going on the same night,

592
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,158
so we kidnapped Ken to
bring the parties together.

593
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,026
Yeah, but it was all
an act of brotherhood.

594
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,430
Ken took it hard and
kidnapped me a week later
in retaliation.

595
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:37,201
So in re-retaliation,
we went back and we
kidnapped Ken's mouli.

596
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,402
What's a mouli?

597
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,470
Vegetable slicer.

598
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,439
Ken loved that slicer.

599
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,208
Tonight, Ken and those
fairies from 
Midsummer,

600
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,710
they kidnapped
our guy, Kirk.

603
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,047
That's right. They got him
coming out of the bar.

604
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,684
Now they're holding him,
they won't let him go till
we give back the mouli.

605
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,887
But why don't you just
give back the mouli?

606
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,522
We don't negotiate.

607
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,524
Besides...

608
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,625
I lost it.

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,101
What do you mean?

707
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:48,572
Well, there are these
investors, and they
buy insurance policies.

708
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,374
They're basically...

709
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:54,812
Okay, say you have an
insurance policy that
pays 100k when you die.

710
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,447
That's what Kippy had.

711
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,549
So these guys come in,
they pay half in cash,

712
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:02,219
and then you make
them the beneficiaries.

713
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,322
Why would anybody do that?

714
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,757
It's cancer.

715
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,094
Kippy refused all treatment.

716
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,962
That's why Michael moved in.

717
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,231
He's got, like,
three months.

718
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,966
Three months?

719
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,502
He looks fine.

720
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,939
Well, he has his
good days and bad days.

721
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,941
So, let me get this straight.

722
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,843
Kippy's got
three months to live,

723
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,446
and he gets $50,000
to redecorate his house?

724
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,048
That doesn't make any sense.

725
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,883
(CHUCKLES)

726
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,720
That's Kippy. He just
does things his way.

727
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,857
EDWINA: Grace! Oh.

728
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,659
See you in a second.

729
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,430
Yes!

730
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,145
Kippy, can I get
you something?
Some coffee or water?

731
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,647
You know.

732
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,015
Know what?

733
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,886
You know the worst part?

734
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,276
I used to be able to
do that twice as fast.

735
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,944
(CLICKS TONGUE)

736
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,221
Got any questions
on that Thursday
news supplement?

737
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,023
It was due on
my desk last night.

738
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,791
No, I almost have it.

739
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,693
It's too late now.

740
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:53,063
I had to put Jimmy
and Karen on it
yesterday.

741
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,769
This little play thing's
really screwing you up, buddy.

742
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,706
Yeah, I went to bat for you
for this promotion.
I'm on the line here.

743
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,508
Look, I just hit a rough
patch with the play.

744
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,176
Let me come in early
tomorrow and I'll finish...

745
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,313
You want that promotion,
I'm gonna have to ask
you to make a choice.

746
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,116
You're gonna need
to quit the play.

747
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:16,387
I can't quit the play.
They're counting on me.

748
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,723
WOMAN ON SPEAKER PHONE:
Peter Rooker, you have
a call on line two.

749
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,195
Hello.

750
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,031
MAN: Is this Peter Rooker?

751
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,499
Yes.

752
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,168
Dave Nicolette,
Portland press.
I'm the theater critic.

753
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,237
Oh, hi.

754
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,440
I wanted to do an advance
article on
 Cyrano 
for
the Sunday before opening.

755
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,342
I need an interview.

756
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,077
I've never been
interviewed before.

757
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,412
(LAUGHS)
It's no big deal.

758
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,747
Just a few questions,
take your picture.

759
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,616
I do my interviews
at the Governor's Hotel.

760
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,084
How's 10:00 tomorrow?

761
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,218
That sounds good.

762
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,553
See you then.

763
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,588
All right.
Thank you. Bye.

764
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,859
And you cross
stage left, Peter.

765
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,996
No, no, no. Stage left.
That's my left.

766
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,564
I did move to your left.

767
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:05,202
Yeah, I know, but I said
stage left, which is
your left, my right.

768
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,237
So your right is my left?

769
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,507
Just walk over
there and talk.

770
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:16,513

to walk in my own way

EDWINA: Could you
be a little more...

775
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,693
A little more heroic?

776
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,794
He's not gonna make it.

777
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:31,862
No way.

778
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,731
EDWINA: He's a legend,
bigger than life.

779
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,366
Secure, confident. A giant.

I need another six feet here.

783
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,079
The clouds have to close!

784
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,083
What's up with
the nose battle?

785
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,185
The board are on me
with a vengeance.

786
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,388
They say no one
will buy Cyrano
without the nose.

787
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,560
Nobody's gonna buy
this Cyrano anyway.

788
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,329
It's only been a week.

789
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,464
I think he's getting better.

790
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,834
He sucks! I can
call the shots.

791
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,537
I think he needs a chance.

792
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,039
We should work with him.
You and I can get him there.

793
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,274
What?

794
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,642
What?

795
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:22,045
What, you getting all
chummy with Peter now?

796
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,181
What, are you
feeling something?

797
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,183
Uh, well, yeah.
I'm feeling something.

798
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,851
Huh. Interesting.

799
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,555
You and I should help him,
or I will kill you.

800
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:35,225
And I promise, it will
be slow and painful.

801
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,394
Okay?

802
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,830
Okay?

00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,198
Thank you.

00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,435
Interesting.

805
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,304
I think we should
get a little physical,
you know?

806
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,872
See if we can get
this guy in your body.

807
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,441
You know,
how he moves, huh?

808
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,709
Get your script.

809
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,078
Well, actually, I got
this book on acting,

810
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,980
and it's got all these
games and exercises.

811
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,348
Get your script.
No, but in the book,

812
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,184
it says that a lot of
great actors do this.

813
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,119
They play these games.

814
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,655
Like this one. It's a
trust exercise. Watch.

815
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,857
This is to show you
that I trust you.

816
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,792
So I cross
my arms like this

817
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,561
and then I fall back
without any tension

818
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,529
and trust that you'll
catch me. You ready?

819
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,764
Trust me. Okay.

820
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,234
Ow! Ow!

821
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,436

that part right.

That was really
bad, wasn't it?

828
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,120
No, no, it wasn't bad.

829
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,722
It's just so easy for you.

830
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,757
Oh, easy?

831
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,126

three years ago.

832
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,494
My first show.

00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,096

It was the first thing
I was any good at.

836
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,768
Really?

837
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,538
Yeah. Michael saw it.

838
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,975
The first show,
he saw so deep
inside of me.

839
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,446
Yeah, he knew
what I wanted.

00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,849
Mmm.

841
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,586
Tell me about what you want.

842
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,256
Hmm?
What I want?

843
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,490
Mmm-hmm.

844
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,996
Everything is about,
"What do I want
at this moment?"

845
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,497
Everything.

846
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,432
That's what defines us.

847
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,369
Tell me what you want.

What do you want, Peter?

849
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,173
I don't know.

850
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,842
Yes, you do.

851
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,779
You know exactly
what you want at
this moment in time.

852
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:36,947
I do?

853
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,682
All it takes is a
moment of decision

854
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,784

What?
But we were kissing.

00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,132

00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,034
That was a stage kiss.

00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,307
But I... But I thought...
Peter,

876
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,677
you don't have to be
so earnest all the time.

877
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,580
Okay.

878
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,449
And stop being so agreeable.

879
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,817
All right.

00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,421
No! No!

open relationship.

of the light.

this constant

I can be expected to play
Cyrano without my nose.

Yes, Ken,
it is you up here, but...

So the entire audience
will be wanting to
see Cyrano's nose.

But this is not a play
about a nose, Ken.

one of the townspeople

1100
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:30,686
Wouldn't it be worse
watching every night,
playing a small part?

There's no small parts.
Only small actors, right?

about their next job.

about it and I realized,
sooner or later,

it was great.

1227
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:39,315
Hey, I forgot my script.

1228
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,417
I'll see you later, huh?

1229
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,419
Okay, I'll see you later.

1230
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:47,289
Hey.

1231
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,625
Hey yourself.

1232
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,527
You going home?

1233
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,028
I don't know.

1234
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:57,700
Huh. I just...

1235
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:00,936
Peter, I just wanted to say
that it was big of you

1236
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,807
to step out of the role
and still stay in the show.

1237
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,308
Are you okay?

1238
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:08,677
Yeah. I'm fine.

1239
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:14,283
I mean, 'cause, you know,
if you want to talk about it,

1240
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,751
I understand.

1241
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:16,886
Talk?

1242
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,388
Yeah.

1243
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:24,894

We'll try and do
two run-throughs today,

lights, partial costumes.

1275
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,209
I want you to pace yourselves.

1276

check your props.

01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,405
Hey.

1284
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,741
Peter, why don't you run
that last sword fight
scene with me?

1285
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:53,909
You know it, right?

1286
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,044
Sure.

1287
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,682
Tech Saturday.

1288
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,685
Did you get to
sleep last night?

1289
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:03,952
Yeah. Huh?

1290
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,120
Ow!

1291
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,522
You?
Uh-huh.

1292
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,923
You must have.

1293
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,658
I called your house,
but the phone was
off the hook.

1294
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,060
It was?

1295
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,227
Ow!

1296
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,773
Michael!

1297
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,375
Knock it off.

1298
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,411
Peter and I were together.

1299
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,780
Okay? So what?

1300
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,516
You were the one who wanted
this open arrangement.

1301
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,552
It was fine when
it suited you.

1302
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,520
Yeah, it was fine
when it suited me.

1303
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,356
You said it didn't matter
if I slept with other people.

1304
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,523
'Cause I didn't think
that you would.

1305
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,325
And you're supposed
to be my friend.

1306
01:12:43,358 --> 01:12:44,927
You could've at least
asked me first.

1307
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,062
I did ask you,
and you said yes.

1308
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,163
What?

1309
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,531
I didn't mean it.

1310
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,867
I meant it in theory,
but in practice,
it isn't working.

1311
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,370
I don't understand
why this is such a big deal.

1312
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,805
It's not like
it's the first time.

1313
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,440
What?

1314
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,242
You know what?
Wish it never happened.

1315
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:01,343
Really?

1316
01:13:01,376 --> 01:13:02,745
No, actually...

1317
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,513
For you... No, for him,
I wish it never happened.

1318
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,849
For you, I'm happy.

1319
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,418
You know what?
Just forget it.

1320
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,719
Michael, stop.

1321
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,221
This is important.

1322
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,422
I think you should
let it out.

1323
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:14,857
I think you should
let everything out.

1324
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,859
Yeah, I think you should
let it out, Michael.

1325
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,627
PETER: Just drop
the sword down first.

1326
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,497
I need the stage
if you three
are finished.

1327
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,032
We're done.
Thank you.

1328
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,502
Why is that chandelier
swinging?

1329
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,305
It needs to
stop swinging!

1330
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,141
Welcome to tech week.

1331
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,543
Yeah.

1332
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,079
Now about
this entrance, Ken,

1333
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:39,648
you're going to be
up there in that balcony,

1334
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:42,317
and I wanted to try
something dramatic.

1335
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:44,987
From up there?

1336
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,755
That must be
10 feet.

1337
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,457
Twelve.

1338
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,859
The only way I'm coming
out of that balcony

1339
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:53,929
is on a very secure ladder
being very securely held

1340
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,565
by two very
secure actors.

1341
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,134
This is a larger-than-life
character, Ken,

1342
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,703
and I don't see
how you're going to be
able to convey that

1343
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,373
climbing down a ladder
like a housepainter.

1344
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:08,110
Well, it's called
acting, Edwina.

1345
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:12,114
Perhaps you should have
some of your actors
try it sometime, hmm?

1346
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:19,455
"Thrice happy he who hides
from pomp and power

Ouch!
Ow!

1356
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:53,922
Steady it!

1357
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,498
It's called acting.

1358
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,801
"No, no, I will not have it.
Spare me this."

Don't stop, Ken.

1376
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:45,374
No, Edwina.
I'm afraid I must stop.

I am the title character
of this play, am I not?

1378
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,111
I'm being completely
overshadowed.

1379
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,646
My back is to
the audience!

1380
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:51,947
EDWINA:
It's Christian's scene.

1381
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,317
Not just in this scene,
in every scene.

1382
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,952
The audience isn't
gonna have
the slightest idea

1383
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,121
what I'm doing
on this stage
without my nose.

1384
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,656
I refuse to go on
without it.

1385
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,757
As far as I'm concerned,

1386
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:04,760
the play is nothing
without the nose.

1387
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,762
Even I cannot act
without it.

1388
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,798
Taking my nose
is like taking my balls!

1389
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,903
I want my balls!

she's calling for you.

What does she want?

Ken's balls.

1394
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,781
