1
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,096
Carmela!

2
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,996
Teresa.

3
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,239
Carmela.

4
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,333
Teresa.

5
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,576
Carmela.

6
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,311
Teresa.

7
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,046
Carmela.

8
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,414
Vamos!

9
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,817
Rápido!

10
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,924
Kill me.

11
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,561
Fire, you son of a bitch!

12
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,644
Carmela.

13
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,720
<i>Fidel Castro is emptying his jails
of political prisoners,</i>

14
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,833
<i>and allow them to flee Cuba.</i>

15
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,468
<i>President Carter has granted asylum</i>

16
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,104
<i>to all the 110.000 Cuban refugees</i>

17
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,839
<i>that have reached American shores.</i>

18
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,742
<i>The last boats departing from Mariel harbor near Havana</i>

19
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,644
<i>are heading towards Key West in a steady flux.</i>

20
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,579
He isn't coming tonight, mamá.

21
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,823
Teresa.

22
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,350
You remember 20 years ago?

23
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,793
I was three.

24
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,424
<i>US immigration officials say the refugees</i>

25
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,068
<i>represent a wide cross section of Cuban society.</i>

26
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>At a Labor Day rally, Fidel Castro urged</i>

27
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,367
<i>one million of his supporters to denounce
the Marielitos leaders...</i>

28
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,412
I wonder what side of the bed he'll sleep on.

29
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,499
I'm waiting two months.

30
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,168
When I can go on the boat?

31
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,670
Bonita...

32
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,201
you don't want to go.

33
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,912
You have a good job cutting sugar cane.

34
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,682
You are a whore, no?

35
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,152
You like it, huh?

36
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,647
I am like Cuba,

37
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,192
used by many, conquered by no one.

38
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,154
A man like you change uniform with each regime...

39
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,590
Batista, Fidel.

40
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,735
But I am siempre La Isla.

41
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,875
What do you want in America

42
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,776
that I can't give you here?

43
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,854
I love Elvis Presley.

44
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,725
And good rock 'n' roll.

45
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,461
I want to fuck

46
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,430
John Wayne.

47
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,830
Oye.

48
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,204
When we get to Miami

49
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,610
I will have a gold coffer

50
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,380
with little shells on top.

51
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,433
We go to United States.

52
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
Marielita soy, soy.

53
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,783
Guárdame El bolso.

54
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,357
I'm dreaming.

55
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,999
Florida. Florida.

56
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,594
I thought we were back in Mariel.

57
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
No, señor, look.

58
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,464
Key West.

59
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,341
Will my wife be here to meet me?

60
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,636
How nice, you have a wife.

61
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,146
That's good.

62
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,018
I didn't know I'd be so old, señora.

63
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,823
My teeth are too poor to kiss my wife.

64
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,934
No worry, you can kiss your wife.

65
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
Guard my things, señor.

66
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,008
No! No!

67
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,129
<i>Play "Nothin' but a Hound Dog".</i>

68
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,956

One bag, please.

75
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,615
Hey! Hey! One bag!

76
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,376
Name?

77
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,086
Juan Raúl Pérez.

78
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,157
Political prisoner. Your charge?

79
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,204
I set my sugar cane fields on fire,

80
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,168
instead of giving them to him, to Fidel.

81
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,965
Marital status? Married?

82
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
Sí.

83
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,945
Your name?

84
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,226
Ponga Dottie.

85
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,451
Dorita Evita Pérez.

86
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,678
I don't like Dorita.

87
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,638
I hate Evita. Little Dora, little Eva.

88
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,018
You see, it's not a matter of like or dislike.

89
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,586
I'm a new woman here.

90
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,254
You came here for political asylum.

91
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,176
You can change your name some other time, okay?

92
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,958
I don't want political asylum.

93
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,661
I came here to get away from political asylum.

94
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,996
I don't want no government.

95
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,965
Do you have any other relatives here?

96
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,142
I mean, other than your wife?

97
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,312
Yes.

98
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,721
Pérez.

99
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,343
If you want something done in this life, ask a Pérez.

100
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,354
There are so many of us.

101
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,557
My mother was a Pérez.

102
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,680
They didn't ask me anything about Carmela.

103
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,091
They didn’t ask me nothing.

104
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,862
América!

105
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,265
You're very lucky that you're married.

106
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,580
Sponsors here don't want single people,

107
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,260
especially single ladies.

108
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,501
Sponsors?

109
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,946
We're getting a criminal element from your Cuba.

110
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,550
Prostitutes, riffraff,

111
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,437
Izzy dizzy.

112
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,655
No, they're undesired.

113
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,783
For the sponsors

114
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,428
large families at the top of the list.

115
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,455
Single people

116
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,901
stock in camps, waiting,

117
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,502
waiting,

118
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,362
simply waiting.

119
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,431
Ay, Dios mío.

120
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,234
Is it over? They're close to leave?

121
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,069
Yeah. Thank god.

122
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,937
This morning anyone named Pérez?

123
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,381
Everyone named Pérez.

124
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm looking for Juan Pérez.

125
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,047
Try 110.000 Marielitos in two month, my friend,

126
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,924
half of them named Juan Pérez.

127
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,253
Only one today... Juan Pérez.

128
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,387
Excuse me?

129
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,122
And his wife, Dorita Pérez.

130
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:36,060
Wife? No, no, no. I'm looking for...

131
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,396
I give you 20 dollars for stop making that noise!

132
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,407
It's free.

133
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,501
I'm looking for the Juan Pérez

134
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,570
that's married to my sister Carmela in Miami.

135
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,281
You're positive this Juan Pérez has a wife?

136
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,017
Miami!

137
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,069
Que puta.

138
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,656
I hired six boats to go to Mariel.

139
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,324
You know how much it costs me?

140
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,260
And for what? Human garbage!

141
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,304
You're working for Fidel, my friend.

142
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,982
Come mierda!

143
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,798
Are you French?

144
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,196
No.

145
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,778
Carmela, the radio.

146
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,047
I heard they closed the boat lift. Did he come?

147
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,815
He's coming today, I feel it.

148
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,360
You know how you get those feelings?

149
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,987
I hope this is working

150
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,455
Ángel went to Key West.

151
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,126
He's supposed to call me when he's back with Juan Raúl.

152
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,803
It's okay. I'm just so excited.

153
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,075
Ángel.

154
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,912
<i>Carmela.</i>

155
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,414
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

156
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>The last boat arrived</i>

157
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>and Juan Raúl did not come.</i>

158
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,092
<i>Carmela?</i>

159
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,221
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

160
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,656
<i>I kept sending them bribes</i>

161
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,533
<i>to get him out of jail.</i>

162
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,032
<i>Don't cry, Carmelina.</i>

163
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,404
<i>I'll take care of you.</i>

164
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,814
Ángel, no.

165
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,884
No.

166
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,089
Juan.

167
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,131
Do you really have a wife in Miami?

168
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,465
When was the last time you hear from her?

169
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,689
Two years ago.

170
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,057
I have a letter.

171
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,859
Nothing in two years?

172
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,777
No money, no nothing?

173
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:57,301
Your wife could be dead, señor.

174
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,902
She could be in a terrible accident

175
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,204
or married to somebody else.

176
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,639
She could be the wife of a rich man.

177
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,917
She could be living in Venezuela.

178
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,355
Are you sure your wife is waiting for you?

179
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,258
Because I have a solution.

180
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,094
Oye.

181
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,222
If your wife does not come

182
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,165
you and I can pretend to be married.

183
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,110
Pérez y Pérez.

184
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,604
Just for the rich sponsor.

185
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,075
When we're free, I help you to find your wife.

186
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,486
I don't need your help, señora.

187
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,941
Carmela will come for me.

188
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,144
Good! Then you can take me into your house

189
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,779
to pay me for my kindness,

190
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,290
until I find a job.

191
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,427
Don't worry, I take very good care of you.

192
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,801
I explain your wife I have no interest in you.

193
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,601
It is strictly survival.

194
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,264
Hollywood.

195
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,165
That's where John Wayne live.

196
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,243
Only 65 miles to John Wayne.

197
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,919
Oh, I go there tomorrow.

198
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,782
<i>Welcome to the Orange Bowl Football Stadium.</i>

199
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,717
<i>You're permitted to leave the premises</i>

200
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,030
<i>between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.</i>

201
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,624
<i>After 9:00 p.m. is curfew. But remember,</i>

202
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,661
<i>when you're out, you are on your own.</i>

203
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,064
<i>If you do not return you will be deemed illegal.</i>

204
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,666
<i>So, be careful.</i>

205
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,678
<i>Obey the rules of the United States Immigration Service.</i>

206
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,861
<i>Welcome to freedom.</i>

207
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,865
Oh, my god, they're going to shoot us!

208
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,834
<i>These men are not los policía,</i>

209
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,670
solamente seguridade.

210
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,815
<i>They're not going to fire.</i>

211
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,376
Señora, stay behind me!

212
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,511
Juan, you're not in Cuba!

213
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,347
The police will not touch you.

214
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,548
Stop this!

215
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,183
If Americans will think you're crazy,

216
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,085
I have to get another husband.

217
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,787
They really ought to debrief these people.

218
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,332
Señora, don't leave me.

219
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,367
I won't leave you.

220
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,437
Ángel has completely lost his paranoid little mind.

221
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,039
Show some respect to your uncle.

222
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,808
He's just trying to protect us with this crime wave.

223
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,310
This is the crime wave,

224
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,112
buy a gun with no serial numbers,

225
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,590
and then give it to his own sister without a permit.

226
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,452
Mamá.

227
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,575
Why don't you take the medicine?

228
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:35,080
The doctor says that you will feel a lot stronger.

229
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,802
He's right. I feel a lot stronger.

230
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,791
Put the coffee back on, Teresa, por favor.

231
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,226
Hola, Ángel.

232
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,790
Didn't you lock the door?

233
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,406
How many times have I told you

234
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,308
about the Mariel criminals?!

235
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,270
Castro flush his toilets on us!

236
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,857
He forgot to flush one, Ángel.

237
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,318
He forgot to send my husband.

238
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,488
Carmelina, as if I didn't try everything!

239
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,922
I send them bribes!

240
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,325
"As if I hadn't done everything!"

241
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,327
"I spend every goddamn dime. And for what?"

242
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,595
"She doesn't even thank me."

243
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,762
When was the last time

244
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,197
you even get a letter from him?

245
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,481
What do you expect, a Hallmark Card?

246
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,368
Go to the car. I'll take you to the hospital.

247
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,379
Shut up! I'm your uncle!

248
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,010
Carmela, where's the gun I gave you?

249
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,550
You have to keep it where you can use it.

250
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,251
I threw it in the garbage.

251
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,419
- Are you crazy?!
- Stop it, Ángel!

252
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,088
What do you think you're doing?!

253
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,190
My mother does not need a gun!

254
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,594
You don't have a man along to protect you.

255
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,805
What happens when a Marielito comes through that door?

256
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,675
Oh, shit. Were we that loud?

257
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,237
Hide the gun. I take care of this.

258
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,447
No.

259
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,616
In there.

260
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,215
Hi, we got a complaint.

261
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,150
Just wanna make sure everything's okay.

262
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,752
Oh, I'm so sorry.

263
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,121
I realized too late the TV was too loud.

264
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,580
Very loud. Looks like it bust a hole
in your wall over there.

265
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,727
We're having some work gone.

266
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,396
It's been that way for weeks.

267
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,838
Do you mind if we come in and look around just a little bit?

268
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,199
It'll just take a minute.

269
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,481
Carmela Pérez?

270
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,785
Yes, and this is my daughter Teresa Pérez.

271
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,020
She studies art history at FIU.

272
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,164
Why do you have a beeper, Miss Pérez?

273
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,926
We're waiting for my husband on the boat lift.

274
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,492
My brother gave it to me in case I wasn't near a phone.

275
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,281
That is actually the truth,

276
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,268
and yes, I know, the boat lift is over.

277
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,606
July '80. This prescription was filled today.

278
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,682
Where are the Valium?

279
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,209
I put them down the sink.

280
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,697
Surely did.

281
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,191
If I'm in pain, I wanna know it.

282
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,159
It's my philosophy exactly.

283
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,520
Forgive me, Miss Pérez, but I don't wanna leave you

284
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,723
if you're in some kind of situation with a man.

285
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:00,841
A man?

286
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,934
There is no man here.

287
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,672
There is no man here?

288
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,407
No.

289
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,369
Okay.

290
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,503
My name is John Pirelli.

291
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,804
I'm a federal agent.

292
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,139
Officer Rhoades here is the cop.

293
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,250
I’m just doing some research with the local force.

294
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:20,242
If you're in any kind of trouble

295
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,788
I want you to give one of us a call, okay?

296
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,149
Yes, of course.

297
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,193
But there is no trouble.

298
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,129
Okay. Sorry I bothered you.

299
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,884
You're a really good liar!

300
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,835
Wow!

301
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,581
Maybe the most beautiful liar I ever met.

302
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,183
Tití! What happened to you?

303
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,123
Tití!

304
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,263
Why you're always wet, Flavia?

305
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,964
You're always in the shower.

306
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,033
You could've come in. I was lonely.

307
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,078
Ah, god, them painkillers are worthless.

308
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:22,948
Oh, baby. Baby.

309
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,317
Oh, guess what?!

310
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,878
I've been asked to sing at the Varadero Festival.

311
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,092
Yes! They asked me, Flavia, at the Varadero Festival.

312
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,220
Why is it always so messy here?

313
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,620
We can go to your place sometime.

314
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,503
You know how much money I spend on that condo?

315
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:41,791
I don’t wanna get it dirty.

316
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,660
That's why I take the showers.

317
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,646
You don't like things dirty.

318
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:49,159
You like things a little dirty,

319
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,688
papi.

320
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:54,107
- Testing, one, two...
- Stop it, please!

321
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,783
I've failed Carmela.

322
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,463
The only thing my sister has ever asked me for.

323
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,948
You know, Ángel,

324
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,193
you used to be so much fun, until you got obsessed.

325
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:12,122
Okay. Go. Go away!

326
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,391
Go to your clean condo!

327
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,925
I wish your brother-in-law had come,

328
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,761
and this whole thing would be over.

329
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,471
It is over, Tití.

330
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,296
He didn't come

331
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,122
and is never going to.

332
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,594
Juan Raúl Pérez no longer exists.

334
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,418
<i>Teresa, my daughter.</i>

335
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,863
<i>Teresa, mi Linda.</i>

336
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,224
I feel like I'm floating.

337
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,058
20 years ago,

338
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,064
I lay alone in my bed each night.

339
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,125
In the morning,

340
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,670
my pillow would be wet with tears.

341
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,305
Each day

342
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:06,397
I put you in the most beautiful embroidered dresses,

343
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,788
just in case that was the day he would come.

344
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,592
The waiting is familiar now.

345
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,422
It's become a friend.

346
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,256
It's like breathing.

347
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,790
It's part of my life.

348
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,132
He's never coming.

349
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,371
I should be happy.

350
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,325
I wanted papi to come, too, mamá.

351
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:47,318
When I was little, I wanted him more than anything.

352
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,784
But also, it's just good to know finally

353
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,858
that he isn't coming.

354
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:02,958
I was not a prostitute.

355
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,657
If that's what you mean, your paper are a lie.

356
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,474
It is saying,

357
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,644
"agricultural worker."

358
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,088
230 is your number.

359
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:27,927
Do we get the sponsor today?

360
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,275
230 is your number!

361
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,022
For the sponsor,

362
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,036
a large family is number one.

363
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,226
Any children?

364
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,269
No.

365
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,171
No children.

366
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,265
- Any in-laws?
- No.

367
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,499
No in-laws.

368
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,592
I'm going to have to tell you what to do.

369
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,451
Get a job,

370
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:54,743
'cause if you get a job, you'll get a sponsor.

371
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,901
You are liking movies?

372
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,727
Tonight,

373
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,510
Cowboys and Indians.

374
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:10,201
Hey, not my kind of Indian.

375
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,138
Oh, John Wayne!

376
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,993
You know, I'm going to meet him. He live very near.

377
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:21,626
John Wayne is dead.

378
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,574
No, your wrong.

379
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,342
You think in Elvis Presley.

380
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,911
Elvis is dead, yes, but not John Wayne.

381
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:30,288
No.

382
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,392
Big Joe, it's me.

383
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:37,542
Isn't your John Wayne dead?

384
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,536
Not John Wayne.

385
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:48,693
John Wayne is dead.

386
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:14,385
He's dead.

387
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,935
John Wayne is dead.

388
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:20,111
At first I thought...

389
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:24,442
Well, I knew Elvis was dead.

390
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,378
Elvis Presley is dead?

391
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:30,556
So many assassinations.

392
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,743
They told me I have to find a job,

393
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,576
and there are only two things I know how to do.

394
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,916
One is cut sugar cane,

395
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,461
and I cannot see any sugar cane on this football...

396
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,133
The other thing,

397
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:51,469
I was saving it for John Wayne.

398
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:56,253
This isn't libertad, it's prison!

399
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,144
When I will be free?

400
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,651
Juan, you really have a wife?

401
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,019
Carmela.

402
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,812
Carmela is my wife.

403
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,990
Why did she not come for you?

404
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,828
Señora, she doesn't know I'm here.

405
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,602
I didn't tell her I was coming.

406
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,504
I said I'd go away for the weekend, and

407
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,295
it turned into 20 years.

408
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:35,138
Okay. We are going to immigration,

409
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,640
and we're asking them to find her.

410
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,475
Corre, señor.

411
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,519
This is our only chance.

412
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:12,542
And don't forget to tell them maybe she don't live here anymore.

413
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,177
And don't tell them she's your wife.

414
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,412
- Say, she's your sister or your cousin.
- And I don't forget to tell them that I hate communism.

415
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,680
Don't raise it up like that.

416
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,915
It looks nice.

417
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,077
I look as one of my workers in the sugar cane fields.

418
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,021
And what is wrong with that?

419
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,987
My teeth.

420
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,898
I cannot come to Carmela like this.

421
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,169
Juan, you're very handsome.

422
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,307
You don't know what I was.

423
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,970
Juan, believe me, if your wife loves you, she won't mind.

424
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:46,357
But don't hope too much.

425
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,587
Probably we don't even find her.

426
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,540
Lip gloss, Rolex watches, aquí.

427
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,990
Woo, mamá.

428
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,070
Come over here.

429
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,905
I like the way you walk.

430
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,182
Ey, Pérez, it's my customer.

431
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,853
You Pérez?

432
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,839
Me, too.

433
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,626
Dottie Pérez.

434
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:28,079
Felipe. Glad to know you.

435
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,254
You're from Mariel?

436
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,589
- Yeah!
- Oye, mijo.

437
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,192
My husband and I could use another Pérez.

438
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,661
The bigger the family, the quicker get the job.

439
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,796
Thanks, mom, but I did this purse, see,

440
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,498
I'll be famous in about a month.

441
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,866
Besides, I'm a lone wolf.

442
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,044
The wolf

443
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,586
I'm better alone.

444
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,651
You're smart to have your business, mijo.

445
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,445
How much for the nail polish?

446
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,813
50 cents,

447
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,716
and no family discounts, mamá.

448
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,327
Did I ask you for a discount?

449
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,663
Hey, Pérez, where is my money?

450
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,798
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tomorrow, tomorrow.

451
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,706
What's a day? He or she?

452
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,346
No cash, no deal, huh?

453
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:23,372
- Hey!
- Ah, come on.

454
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,116
That's some coconut, eh?

455
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,954
Save me, San Ignacio.

456
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,026
Lip gloss, nail polish, right here.

457
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,769
Hey, baby, I missed you.

458
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,759
Felipe, my pal.

459
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,394
Where you been, Mr. Invisible?

460
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,197
Hey, Orlando, I've been trying to find you.

461
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,531
I'm getting the money together.

462
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,800
You know, man, I've been trying.

463
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,312
Really trying.

464
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,038
I tell you what, you little fuck and faggot...

465
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,973
I'm gonna give you 24 hours.

466
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,908
Oh, no. See, it's that...

467
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,877
I need more time. Please, man.

468
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,348
You're out of time. Mañana.

469
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,925
Shit!

470
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,552
Oh, come on, man,

471
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,887
don't kill me.

472
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,592
Yay, Pepito. Yay, Pepito.

473
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,960
Yay, Pepito.

474
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,595
Pepito.

475
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,230
Here is your money.

476
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,910
Ah, gracias.

477
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,110
- My wife has come?
- Now, just follow me.

478
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,980
I didn't know she would be here.

479
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,183
I was standing waiting in line.

480
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,142
I didn't know.

481
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,153
Look at this shirt.

482
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:10,986
Yay, Pepito.

483
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,316
Pérez, presenting your wife.

484
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,263
See my hips. Money.

485
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,441
This woman is not my wife. Where is my wife?

486
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,856
Shut up. You're crazy?

487
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,258
This woman is not my wife!

488
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,592
Oye, loco.

489
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,795
Do you want me to find another husband?

490
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,096
He's always looking down to me.

491
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,520
Before the revolution he was married to a princesa.

492
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:49,494
Carmelina.

493
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,600
Carmela.

494
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,145
This is the best security system money can buy.

495
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,913
You'll be completely save now.

496
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,348
I am save, Ángel.

497
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,753
No, no, no. Carmelina, no.

498
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,628
No one is save.

499
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,125
I think of you here, in this house alone.

500
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,106
This is not a good world.

501
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,917
I shouldn't have bought the condo.

502
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,990
No, no. Ángel, don't give up the condo.

503
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:39,797
You need your independence.

504
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,175
I would never forgive myself

505
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,029
if something happened to you.

506
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,866
You're the only family I have.

507
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,320
You're everything to me.

508
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,398
Mr. Díaz.

509
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,449
Mr. Díaz!

510
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,136
How many times have I told you

511
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,704
to put the grids on the window?!

512
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,282
Put these grids on every window!

513
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,987
Now I'm in prison.

514
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:49,765
I dreamed I was in prison.

515
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,409
I lost all my teeth.

516
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,744
You dream of your manhood.

517
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,122
You fear you've lost your virility.

518
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:02,627
I've not made love to my wife for years and years.

519
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,964
Abuelita, tell me,

520
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,659
do you think she's gone with another man?

521
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,738
Years and years is a long time.

522
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:19,221
Azucar. This polish is some kind of sexy.

523
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,082
Tomorrow, abuelita, sexy American movie.

524
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:33,016
¡Ave Maria purisima!

525
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:48,205
Oh, Santos.

526
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,232
If you were alive,

527
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,743
I would be inside you right now.

528
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,366
Sabroso.

529
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,213
Qué Rico.

530
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,350
Oh, no!

531
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,749
Dios mio.

532
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,048
It's a miracle.

533
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,809
Oh, god, I'm still on duty.

534
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,014
I gotta go.

535
00:43:06,093 --> 00:43:08,060
Let's go to your house.

536
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,622
Oh, god.

537
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,470
The curfew.

538
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,770
I'm... Still, I can't let you out the premises.

539
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,240
Oh, my hero.

540
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:29,406
My United States freedom hero.

541
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:38,526
If you want me,

542
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,677
I deserve a real bed.

543
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,577
Okay, I tell you what...

544
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,792
Friday I'll get you out of here.

545
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,228
I'll take you on a real date.

546
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,593
To a disco?

547
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,379
Okay, disco, everything.

548
00:44:06,183 --> 00:44:07,918
I gotta go.

549
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,687
Gate 14.

550
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:18,806
Mañana.

551
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,798
I remember, in Colima, in October...

552
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,272
thousand butterflies.

553
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,440
Breezes were sweet.

554
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,246
It was never as hot as this.

555
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,543
- Next year...
- Next year...

556
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,487
- in Habana.
- in Habana.

557
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,991
I just come from Cuba, señor.

558
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,919
Believe me, it's hot.

559
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,193
Look around you, my friend,

560
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,770
Cuba is here.

561
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,510
Señor, where is Coral Gables?

562
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:22,339
I'll get some herbs from the yard.

563
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,268
What happened, mamá?

564
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,540
He looked like the beggars in Malecón,

565
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,070
where I was a girl.

566
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:10,323
It's so sad, familiar.

567
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,515
He was casing the house, mamá.

568
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,916
He looked familiar?

569
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,618
There's just something about him,

570
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,378
that reminded me of Havana.

571
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,283
Are you sure it wasn't your husband, Mrs. Pérez?

572
00:48:21,326 --> 00:48:23,906
Oh, no. Not him.

573
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,330
Juan was size 9. These are size 11.

574
00:48:30,557 --> 00:48:32,232
My mother is trying very hard.

575
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,676
to put the memory of my father behind her.

576
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:38,206
Yeah. The poor guy was probably looking for some yard work.

577
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,429
The world is a pretty save place, all things considered.

578
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,549
I hate to see you sitting inside all day
with your doors locked.

579
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,084
You have to get out a little more.

580
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,385
You should live a little.

581
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,862
Maybe I will.

582
00:48:53,258 --> 00:48:55,632
Oh, would you two like some lemonade?

583
00:48:58,308 --> 00:48:59,564
Another day.

584
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:10,447
Mom, you don't offer cops lemonade.

585
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,972
Silencio, por favor.

586
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,133
It is August,

587
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:43,620
and Miami's football teams have begun their practicing,

588
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:48,168
which means that you have to get out tomorrow.

589
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,448
Families of three or more, you'll stay here.

590
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,360
We are finding a sponsor.

591
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:04,025
The rest of you will go on I-95 to the tent city

592
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,562
or you'll be transferred to military bases.

593
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,232
I did not come here to live in a tent on a highway!

594
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,633
This I can do in Cuba!

595
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,177
I...

596
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,790
Mr. Pérez on the football post.

597
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,692
Yes, you!

598
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,930
Get down.

599
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:41,569
Juanito, let's take him to the shower right now!

600
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,365
General Armando Pérez,

601
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,367
from now on your father.

602
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,915
This man is not my father.

603
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,424
If he says so, he's lying.

604
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:50,672
You don't say nothing!

605
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,375
You don't talk, which is good for the sponsor.

606
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,120
Husband, wife, grandfather, that's a family.

607
00:50:56,163 --> 00:50:57,357
Not my family.

608
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,614
Vaya, Juanito, wash him.

609
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,383
I don't even know him!

610
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,684
I can't go in the man's shower,

611
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,085
he can't go in the woman shower.

612
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,430
You wash him. He's your papi!

613
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:09,677
Dorita, I'm leaving.

614
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,695
What do you want from me?

615
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,720
All day and I'm going doing laundry,

616
00:51:15,763 --> 00:51:17,032
finding relatives,

617
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,201
anything, so they don't take us to the military base,

618
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,635
and you think you're too good to get your hands dirty.

619
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:25,240
All I'm asking you to do,
is clean him up, a little, a little.

620
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,568
A little! A Li... Do it!

621
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,111
When we have a sponsor and you are free,

622
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,155
I don't care what you do.

623
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,317
Señora, you're not kind.

624
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:36,423
Maybe not,

625
00:51:37,243 --> 00:51:40,210
but I'm not lying, I'm honest.

626
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:49,338
Ay, this loca, she thinks she owns me.

627
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,399
Be a man.

628
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,735
You can be her husband now.

629
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,837
I'm going to find my wife.

630
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,347
Oye! Oye!

631
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,118
Oye!

632
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,718
Don't forget about our date.

633
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,159
Well, let me guess, please, please, please.

634
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,174
Your husband's father.

635
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,069
After 20 years.

636
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,531
You must be very happy.

637
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,318
Now the sponsor's coming.

638
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,872
With only three members in your family

639
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,834
you are number 27.

640
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,310
But who knows?

641
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,011
Maybe your grandmother

642
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,647
will make a sudden appearance, huh?

643
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,191
Maybe.

644
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,850
I want you to get some false teeth for a man

645
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,293
to save his marriage.

646
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,333
Very old, like me.

647
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,313
Value was about 20 dollar gold.

648
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,306
Don't blame me.

649
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:06,751
Of course, abuelita.

650
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,599
Felipe!

651
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,628
Who is he? Where is his family?

652
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,830
It’s a Pérez. He has no family.

653
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:39,000
Oh, Felipe, my lost son.

654
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,777
You came back.

655
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:44,014
Don't die.

656
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:58,627
Please.

657
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,325
Okay, canine unit are on it's way

658
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,051
to pick up the doberman.

659
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,496
I'm so sorry for your trouble.

660
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,932
My brother Ángel is very protective.

661
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,376
Don't tell me... Older brother?

662
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,652
No.

663
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,673
I brought Angelito with my little girl.

664
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,280
He met Teresa.

665
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:23,511
My husband stayed behind

666
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,547
to look after the sugar cane.

667
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:28,716
It's funny, you know...

668
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,394
This is all I could salvage.

669
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:41,162
Would you like some café cubana?

670
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,798
Hey, we're not in a rush,

671
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,333
are we, officer Rhoades?

672
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,635
Oh, no, sir. I'll call in.

673
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,807
Fresh squeezed.

674
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,342
You do this every morning?

675
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:55,685
No.

676
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,370
Today was the first day of the rest of my life.

677
00:56:10,727 --> 00:56:13,157
I had to start over myself a few years ago.

678
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,544
Divorce. No kids.

679
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:19,652
I don't know.

680
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:23,272
You know, sometimes you start up with this moral impulse.

681
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,200
You want to protect and honor the things you believe in.

682
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:30,037
The work takes over. 10, 15 years down the line,

683
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,046
it fills the whole horizon.

684
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,999
I mean, you can't see anything else.

685
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:43,553
I guess family life doesn't mix with my line of work.

686
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,274
Well, maybe you won't always have this line of work.

687
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,568
I was just thinking that.

688
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,739
Do you want me to deactivate this thing?

689
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,961
I mean, you know, it's very sensitive.

690
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,766
Well... No, thank you.

691
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:04,612
I... It's just couple of wires.

692
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,581
Come on. It'll take five minutes.

693
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,119
Five minutes.

694
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,146
Well, there is something.

695
00:57:10,406 --> 00:57:12,820
You tell your brother there's such thing
as being too secure,

696
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,326
if you know what I mean.

697
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,031
If I were you, I would buy myself a little dog.

698
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,017
They're good company,

699
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,930
and they scare the hell out of the bad guys.

700
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:37,132
A...

701
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:38,989
Agent Pirelli.

702
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,660
Who is this boy?

703
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,953
Your son Felipe.

704
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,862
It's a miracle.

705
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:24,000
I made a sacrifice thanking Babalu Aye.

706
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,898
Dottie told me how he was almost taken from her arms

707
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,020
when he was only a little boy,

708
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:36,379
when you were still in prison.

709
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,106
Well...

710
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,051
You should be grateful to the Santos.

711
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,464
Sí.

712
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,022
Where is the woman of the house?

713
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:51,394
Ah, the Yankee security guy.

714
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,272
Who could love such a woman?

715
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:03,867
She's so ordinary fine.

716
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,839
And she's crazy.

717
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:39,200
Oh, I'm so happy, Steve Steverino.

718
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,702
Had enough?

719
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,969
Wanna go to my place?

720
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,986
I love the music.

721
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,474
What about another Cuba Libre?

722
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,178
Yes, yes, yes.

723
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:21,230
I was never so free.

724
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,178
Would you like another one?

725
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,156
Oh, no, thanks, I'm fine.

726
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,811
I don't usually do this,

727
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:32,954
go out with women I meet on the job.

728
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,104
It's kind of a personal rule of mine.

729
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,629
What the hell, come on, one dance.

730
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:42,997
No, no.

731
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,707
Just one, come on.

732
01:01:06,027 --> 01:01:09,899
Freedom! What a wonderful day!

733
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:12,360
Let's go.

734
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,465
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

735
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,387
It's okay, I'm so sorry.

736
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,810
But I like the music.

737
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,517
I have a radio.

738
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,284
I'd better go home.

739
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,191
Are you sure?

740
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,006
Yes.

741
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,538
I'm Juan Raúl Pérez.

742
01:01:50,426 --> 01:01:51,693
I'm your father.

743
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,945
My father is dead.

744
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,049
So is mine.

745
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,637
For now,

746
01:02:02,817 --> 01:02:05,513
you are the only son of myself

747
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,249
and my wife Dottie Pérez,

748
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,226
who is not here right now,

749
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,132
or as she said, being unfaithful to me.

750
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,693
Everybody's got a story.

751
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,268
<i>Attend! Clearing this sector!</i>

752
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,573
<i>Line up!</i>

753
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,901
<i>Single men on the bus!</i>

754
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,871
We are waiting here for my wife.

755
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,205
Wait for her on the bus. Go!

756
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,907
- No, I can't. My wife...
- Stud, get up!

757
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,041
This one is my son.

758
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,377
Come on! Hey!

759
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,079
That's my son! Don't touch my son!

760
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,443
Security, some support over here!

761
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,863
- What?
- My hero, wait.

762
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,458
What you're on to?

763
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,800
It's my first date in America,

764
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:36,981
and I don't want it quick to be finished. Too quick.

765
01:03:37,024 --> 01:03:38,028
Hey...

766
01:03:38,908 --> 01:03:40,942
I took you to a club,

767
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,844
I bought you four drinks, three bucks a pot.

768
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,255
Christ, what more could you ask for?

769
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,529
I might have a beer here somewhere.

770
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,310
Shit, I'll walk on the beer, babe.

771
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:17,979
Oh, god!

772
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,847
You get what you want,

773
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,325
but don't I get what I want, too?

774
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,360
Right.

775
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,770
I get it..

776
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,611
I'm slow, but I do get it.

777
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,708
Steve Steverino.

778
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,065
I finally get it.

779
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,368
What? Isn't that enough?

780
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,188
It's what you were after, right?

781
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:12,404
Just tell me when.

782
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:19,279
Papi.

783
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:42,184
Where am I?

784
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,678
You're lying on a cot in the Orange Bowl

785
01:07:47,256 --> 01:07:49,244
in the United States,

786
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,556
and we're all here with you.

787
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,904
Your son, and papi, too.

788
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,907
Dottie, you're beautiful.

789
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,178
You always know where you are on this earth.

790
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,641
Welcome to the Church of the Resurrection.

791
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,785
We are your sponsors.

792
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,291
Tomorrow you'll begin your jobs.

793
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,923
Flowers! Flowers!

794
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:23,884
Two roses.

795
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,953
Gracias. I'm happy.

796
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,289
Say hi to your wife for me, okay?

797
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,691
You look like you're in the mood to spend some money.

798
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,359
Wait for me, Dottie.

799
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,077
I will you get something to eat.

800
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,876
Gracias.

801
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,787
Um, bred?

802
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,251
If we put all our money together,

803
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:24,553
sometime we can get our own flower shop.

804
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,516
Would you like that, mi vida?

805
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,594
I feel save with you, mamá.

806
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:33,963
"Mamá"?

807
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:47,801
You are not sleeping there.

808
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,537
- Take the bed.
- No, no, no.

809
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,682
Don't be ridiculous. Get in the bed.

810
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,319
I forgot everything about beds.

811
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,661
I wonder which side Carmela sleeps on.

812
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,284
<i>Carmela!</i>

813
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,904
Good morning, señor hard-on.

814
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,179
I was dreaming.

815
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,140
Oh, Jesus!

816
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,684
Your father is up on a tree!

817
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,079
I saw you watching!

818
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:46,122
Miss Pérez, you cannot come out dressed like that.

819
01:12:46,164 --> 01:12:47,254
Tell her, Father.

820
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,489
Go in and get dressed!

821
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:49,988
Come down, papi.

822
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,833
Good morning, Father. How are you?

823
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:02,191
Look at his hard-on.

824
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:11,104
I know, I know, you're happily married.

825
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:13,613
and you may think you don't need a lot of inspiration,

826
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,682
but let me tell you,

827
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,584
I got this bed for girlfriend,

828
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:21,421
and ever since, we dance
the Mambo and Merengue every night.

829
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,140
Look, this, my dear lovers, is beauty.

830
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,031
Money can't buy taste.

831
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,866
- Ángel?
- We'll think about this.

832
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,135
No, no, no. I can't have you people hanging out here.

833
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:38,639
I'm very busy right now. Nice, huh?

834
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:39,927
You're grown up.

835
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,118
I guess you don't recognize me.

836
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,880
No, I guess I don't,

837
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,316
and now I don't have time to play games right now.

838
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,029
Here.

839
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,922
Buy yourself some food and don't come back here.

840
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:56,344
It's Juan Raúl,

841
01:13:57,526 --> 01:13:59,057
your brother-in-law.

842
01:14:02,957 --> 01:14:04,959
How did you know my brother-in-law?

843
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,610
I am your brother-in-law.

844
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:10,757
Come to my office.

845
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,849
Enjoy, huh?

846
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,269
Sit down. I'm gonna need you.

847
01:14:20,549 --> 01:14:21,592
Yes?

848
01:14:29,778 --> 01:14:30,933
Sit down.

849
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,827
What do you want? Money?

850
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,432
I just want the truth, Ángel.

851
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,671
Ah, the truth.

852
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,574
When did you get out?

853
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,540
Few days ago, I think.

854
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:53,322
Seems like a month. So much has happened.

855
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,093
So, they let you out of El Morro, huh?

856
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,473
I was not in El Morro. I was in Calvario.

857
01:15:02,993 --> 01:15:06,060
You knew that. This is you, isn't it?

858
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,472
You are Ángel Díaz, aren't you?

859
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:11,684
Coño.

860
01:15:12,848 --> 01:15:15,375
You were in Coral Gables the other day.

861
01:15:15,618 --> 01:15:17,216
So, Carmela does live there.

862
01:15:18,773 --> 01:15:20,108
Is she okay?

863
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:24,137
And Teresa, is she all right?

864
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:27,956
My sister moved sometime along.

865
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,360
If you were Juan Pérez, you would know that.

866
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:38,880
What is it?

867
01:15:41,142 --> 01:15:42,746
Has something happened?

868
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,206
Has Carmela remarried?

869
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:52,179
Is that why you don't want to tell me?

870
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:57,710
Am I forgotten?

871
01:16:02,323 --> 01:16:04,016
What gives you the right to come in here

872
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,795
asking questions about my family, huh?

873
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,571
Ángel, just tell me the truth

874
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,780
I... I'm prepared.

875
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,254
The truth is...

876
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:37,542
you are not my brother-in-law.

877
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:45,351
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

878
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,803
Call the police. I have a burglar here,

879
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,405
impersonating my brother-in-law.

880
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,053
<i>I'm calling the police right now, Mr. Diaz.</i>

881
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:03,403
You can't get near Carmela!

882
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:08,349
You can't get near my sister, or I'll kill you!

883
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,631
Maybe she hates me.

884
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,702
Or she could be married to someone else.

885
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:24,120
I must know, papi.

886
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,217
Is it possible you called the police,

887
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:45,952
and then forgot you called?

888
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,621
Why would I do something like that?

889
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,491
Miss Pérez, someone called us.

890
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,491
Maybe you're lonesome.

891
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:54,127
I don't call police when I feel lonely.

892
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,896
I have my daughter Teresa,

893
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,831
I take classes in Miami Dade,

894
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,967
batik, ceramics, last winter scuba diving...

895
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,975
I love scuba. Are you a scuba diver?

896
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,173
So far only in the deep end of the college.

897
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:08,892
Come on. You get the Keys out there, you got the Caribbean.

898
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,868
Well, sometimes it's hard for me to do
the things I wanna do.

899
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,818
I get nervous.

900
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:18,752
So nervous, you keep calling the police.

901
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,153
Rhoades, why don't you go inside

902
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,896
and look for prints or something?

903
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,376
Seems, like, wherever I see you

904
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:44,711
there is a dog chasing you,

905
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,555
or somebody break into your house.

906
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,015
Look, Carmela,

907
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:52,219
I... I know it didn't work out the other night,

908
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,554
and I don't wanna push or anything,

909
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,523
but I have to go to D.C.,

910
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,191
just for a little while.

911
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:01,061
So, I just want you to know that

912
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,901
I'm much better on second dates.

913
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,934
So, maybe you could call me sometime?

914
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:09,177
Please?

915
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,314
What do you say?

916
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,742
I'll think about it.

917
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,693
Don't make me wait.

918
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,700
You have a headache, Tití?

919
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,483
What happened? You want something?

920
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:53,828
My hair used to be so dark.

921
01:20:57,104 --> 01:20:59,273
Now it's gray, like an old man.

922
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,779
I like your hair, mi amor.

923
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:10,018
The silver is very aristocratic.

924
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,137
Mamá, I don't wanna sleep alone.

925
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,244
Can I sleep here with you?

926
01:21:21,242 --> 01:21:23,678
I like it when you call me mamá.

927
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,617
Come here.

928
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,953
On the floor.

929
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,457
Tomorrow we put a mattress.

930
01:21:40,576 --> 01:21:42,073
Thank you, mamá.

931
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:50,210
Maybe we can buy you some new teeth.

932
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:52,774
We enough enough.

933
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:56,178
300 dollar.

934
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:09,691
You smell like flowers.

935
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:26,232
He hear us talk, then he took the money

936
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,500
to buy you some false teeth.

937
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,936
Ah, wake up! Good morning!

938
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,571
The boy took the money and ran away.

939
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,740
It's my son. He doesn't steal from me!

940
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,241
In the land of the blind

941
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:36,893
the one-eyed might be king.

942
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:41,081
Felipe's gonna come soon,

943
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,791
and then you'll see.

944
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,045
Can't get the car started?

945
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,537
Uh, yeah, wanna help?

946
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:04,726
Nice car.

947
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:08,183
You know, I love getting to the beach early.

948
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,010
Am I doing this right?

949
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,613
Beautiful. Perfect.

950
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,591
So, I guess you're not going to the beach, huh?

951
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,760
Let's go.

952
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,890
Enough, Angelito. If I do this,

953
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,612
there will be no more bars on the windows,

954
01:23:25,654 --> 01:23:27,214
no alarms, no police, no police dogs...

955
01:23:27,256 --> 01:23:28,670
Okay.

956
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:31,217
But, Carmelita, promise me...

957
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:35,111
promise me you carry this with you at all times.

958
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,246
And if you ever see a Marielito...

959
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,015
Boom.

960
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,517
Promise me?

961
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,386
I promise.

962
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,428
You look beautiful.

963
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:58,606
Now, just imagine that this is a Marielito criminal.

964
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,011
When I stop the car in front,

965
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,445
you go to the other one, okay?

966
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,381
You can do it. Like this.

967
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:23,516
Don't you dare walk like that for another man.

968
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:27,120
Come back here. I'll buy all your flowers myself.

969
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,055
I could never have a husband so

970
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:31,733
jealous like you.

971
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:35,628
Flowers!

972
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,138
You tempt me.

973
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:40,108
You want to take them all? Gracias.

974
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,415
Idiot! The light is... Aaahh!

975
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,478
Coño, ese marielito.

976
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,056
I'm gonna find where this maricón lives.

977
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:56,216
Coño!

978
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,127
Parasites!

979
01:24:59,402 --> 01:25:00,419
Oye!

980
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,597
Does parasites wear high heels?!

981
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:27,722
Mañana.

982
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,053
He was only a little boy.

983
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,491
An angel.

984
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:07,829
I wish he really was our son.

985
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:13,001
Except he would be dead now.

986
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,072
We must not martyr him, mi amor.

987
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,549
He was from the street,

988
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,125
mixed up with bad people.

989
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,013
Gangsters.

990
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,385
He had no family. He wanted to change.

991
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,990
To be with us.

992
01:26:33,341 --> 01:26:34,424
Sí.

993
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:36,424
Maybe.

994
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,863
Maybe he was just looking for somewhere to hide.

995
01:26:55,797 --> 01:26:58,300
The truth is so easily lost, Dorita.

996
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,723
If we lie about ourselves,

997
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,910
it opens the door to a world of madness.

998
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:16,431
Why we come to this terrible country?

999
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,425
We must be strong, mi amor.

1000
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:08,681
Your father!

1001
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,956
What you see up there, papi?

1002
01:28:17,052 --> 01:28:18,377
Angelito.

1003
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,628
That's the one.

1004
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,950
You, impostor.

1005
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:24,824
I came here to tell you,

1006
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:26,658
stay away from my sister,

1007
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,745
or I'll have you thrown in jail.

1008
01:28:30,345 --> 01:28:32,880
You were my jailer in Cuba, Angelito.

1009
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:39,380
20 years you keep me in prison,

1010
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,250
torture.

1011
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,186
because of you.

1012
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:48,614
In her letters Carmela tells me

1013
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,407
of the money you sent.

1014
01:28:50,794 --> 01:28:52,494
A river of money.

1015
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:55,264
I never saw it.

1016
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:59,767
I write to her, "Don't send bribes."

1017
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:01,936
But no,

1018
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,941
you must play the big man.

1019
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,678
20 years.

1020
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:14,307
Oh, we'll keep Juan Raúl in here

1021
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,476
because Ángel Díaz in Miami

1022
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,152
send so much money!

1023
01:29:18,195 --> 01:29:19,227
Coño!

1024
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:20,889
Jesus!

1025
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,721
If you want my sister Carmela, why do you keep this whore?

1026
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,067
Oh, oh, Ángel!

1027
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,098
Not a word of this to Carmela.

1028
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,366
Ángel, no.

1029
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:43,378
It would break your heart to see what Juan Raúl has become

1030
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,074
Let me out of the car.

1031
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:48,514
I mean it, Ángel, let me out!

1032
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:55,026
I thought you knew something about love.

1033
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,333
I'm burning.

1034
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,781
I'm burning. No...

1035
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,274
It's so...

1036
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:13,675
Felipe is burning in hell.

1037
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,522
I believe

1038
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,761
hell is here on earth, Dottie.

1039
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,869
Hell is waiting for the worst

1040
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:43,851
to happen,

1041
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:47,922
for the sound of your own execution,

1042
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:51,646
and it never comes.

1043
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:56,257
Hell is waiting for the best to happen,

1044
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,427
and it never comes.

1045
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:03,725
Never comes. We'll never be save, Tití.

1046
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,479
Our only deliverance

1047
01:31:28,436 --> 01:31:30,372
is to stop waiting,

1048
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:33,388
to expect nothing,

1049
01:31:36,431 --> 01:31:37,799
to love

1050
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,062
desperately,

1051
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,067
without hoping for another.

1052
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,832
Ah, Mrs. Pérez?

1053
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,401
Dottie?

1054
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,236
Dorita.

1055
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,506
My name is Dorita.

1056
01:33:01,476 --> 01:33:03,511
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1057
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:19,338
Last night I talked to Teresa,

1058
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:21,378
the daughter.

1059
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:30,905
This is very difficult for me to ask.

1060
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:38,279
Do you love Juan?

1061
01:33:48,996 --> 01:33:50,382
Would you give him up?

1062
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:03,566
When I dream about coming here,

1063
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,374
I never dream about Juan.

1064
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,177
I want a man who is free.

1065
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,581
The way I thought the United States was free.

1066
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,485
Inside of him free.

1067
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,315
After so many years,

1068
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,462
how could the gods have planned it this way?

1069
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:28,863
Exactly.

1070
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,792
Ángel thinks I'm stupid and romantic

1071
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:36,807
because I really, really think
that Carmela and Juan belong together.

1072
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:40,074
She waited a long time for him.

1073
01:34:42,492 --> 01:34:44,465
More than I would wait for a man.

1074
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,857
At the Varadero Festival tonight,

1075
01:34:53,156 --> 01:34:54,442
I'm singing.

1076
01:35:05,171 --> 01:35:07,532
Then I'll make my surprise announcement.

1077
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:15,367
A man and a wife who have not seen each other in 20 years,

1078
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:18,045
we're going to reunite them right here.

1079
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:24,592
Don't tell Juan, okay?

1080
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:28,890
We're not going to talk to Carmela anything.

1081
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:50,511
You're so handsome.

1082
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:56,684
What is it?

1083
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,112
Is it Felipe?

1084
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:07,428
I love you.

1085
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:10,531
Never leave me.

1086
01:36:19,499 --> 01:36:21,382
I want to dance with you.

1087
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:25,506
You're so beautiful.

1088
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:50,865
Back. Come on.

1089
01:37:57,457 --> 01:37:58,980
Oh, my God.

1090
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:18,759
Excuse me.

1091
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:28,025
Hey, Flavia! I'm sorry! I love you!

1092
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:39,880
Marielita soy. Cubanita soy.

1093
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:44,285
Juan Raúl,

1094
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,022
no matter what happens...

1095
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:51,358
Dorita, no more waiting.

1096
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:55,109
Juan.

1097
01:38:56,179 --> 01:38:58,451
Shit. Carmela!

1098
01:38:59,459 --> 01:39:01,161
Juan Raúl is here!

1099
01:39:02,009 --> 01:39:03,468
Hey! Carmela!

1100
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,639
Look! It is Juan Raúl!

1101
01:39:11,425 --> 01:39:14,853
Look at me! Hey! Carmela!

1102
01:39:14,968 --> 01:39:16,270
It's him!

1103
01:39:21,725 --> 01:39:24,525
Oh, shit, look, there's Juan Raúl!

1104
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:32,466
Gracias!

1105
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:35,870
Can't you see?

1106
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:39,765
- Carmela?
- <i>Gracias.</i>

1107
01:39:39,874 --> 01:39:41,660
It's not the Marielito!

1108
01:39:42,243 --> 01:39:44,770
There are two very special people here tonight,

1109
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:46,924
a husband and wife who haven't seen each other

1110
01:39:46,967 --> 01:39:48,814
- in 20 years.
- <i>It's not the Marielito!</i>

1111
01:39:48,887 --> 01:39:49,894
<i>He...</i>

1112
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:52,186
Carmela, no!

1113
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:57,358
Ángel! Ángel!

1114
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:02,669
Juan.

1115
01:40:04,118 --> 01:40:06,206
Tití! Tití!

1116
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:12,506
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1117
01:40:13,274 --> 01:40:16,001
It's just my hand... again.

1118
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:17,511
Call a doctor.

1119
01:40:28,702 --> 01:40:32,520
Okay, family reunion. Big smile!

1120
01:40:33,367 --> 01:40:35,527
You look so much like my mother.

1121
01:40:39,683 --> 01:40:41,760
Tití, you're so brave.

1122
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:43,077
Do you love me?

1123
01:40:44,471 --> 01:40:48,200
Um, listen, we just wanted to thank you for everything.

1124
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:50,836
All your kindness to my father, I mean

1125
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:53,172
- you didn't even...
- It was nothing. Nothing.

1126
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,684
If there's something I can do for you...

1127
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,887
I'll see you at the hospital.

1128
01:41:29,647 --> 01:41:31,710
The cops have to finish the paperwork

1129
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:34,538
before we can go, but I'll take care of it.
You go relax.

1130
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:38,217
Um, maybe I should follow Angelito to the hospital.

1131
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:41,603
No, no, no. You guys take it easy.
Flavia is going with him.

1132
01:41:41,747 --> 01:41:43,870
You have some catching up to do.

1133
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:48,719
Doesn't she look like my mother?

1134
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:50,896
She's always saying that.

1135
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,606
That's the eyes,

1136
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:55,943
so like your grandmother.

1137
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:01,382
I want to know all about her.

1138
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:06,582
I can't believe you're really here.

1139
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:10,591
In fact, I have a lot of questions for you.

1140
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,493
So, get ready, okay?

1141
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:15,068
Talk to him, mami.

1142
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:23,003
You've been a good mother.

1143
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,524
No. Teresa is good.

1144
01:42:26,674 --> 01:42:30,344
She's a good girl, but she's an American.

1145
01:42:32,046 --> 01:42:35,200
Who could ever imagine we would have
an amricana for a daughter?

1146
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:38,073
Does she remember me?

1147
01:42:39,767 --> 01:42:42,236
She says she remembers dancing with you.

1148
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:46,394
But time goes by.

1149
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:48,829
It's hard to remember everything.

1150
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:53,974
Papi, just sign some papers, and we can go.

1151
01:42:57,705 --> 01:42:58,901
Happy?

1152
01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:04,278
I don't know.

1153
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,040
An hour ago, my life was clear

1154
01:43:08,082 --> 01:43:10,335
for the first time in 20 years.

1155
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:12,853
And now...

1156
01:43:13,647 --> 01:43:15,500
Just talk to him, mami,

1157
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:17,773
the way you talk to me.

1158
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,352
Because whatever happens now,

1159
01:43:20,394 --> 01:43:22,727
we'll always be the Pérez family.

1160
01:43:30,935 --> 01:43:33,374
I imagined this moment so many times,

1161
01:43:35,476 --> 01:43:37,244
but never like this.

1162
01:43:41,996 --> 01:43:43,331
But, still,

1163
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,712
I'm sorry I came to you like this.

1164
01:43:46,754 --> 01:43:49,895
Oh, no. I'm so happy you're alive.

1165
01:43:50,124 --> 01:43:51,689
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

1166
01:43:53,554 --> 01:43:55,986
It would've been a privilege to die in your arms.

1167
01:44:01,201 --> 01:44:03,070
I used to lie in the dark,

1168
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:09,176
assembling your face like pieces of a puzzle.

1169
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,650
You're so beautiful.

1170
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:18,218
Exactly as I left you.

1171
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:23,024
I was only a child,

1172
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:25,538
younger than our Teresa is now.

1173
01:44:26,794 --> 01:44:27,919
Younger than Teresa?

1174
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:30,264
Sí. And you weren't much older.

1175
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:46,536
Thank you,

1176
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:50,784
for keeping our family together.

1177
01:44:57,382 --> 01:44:59,484
But now I feel so sad that a woman,

1178
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:01,019
so beautiful and so young,

1179
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:02,751
waited all this time,

1180
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:06,467
for only me.

1181
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,311
But you waited.

1182
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,371
Yes.

1183
01:45:14,374 --> 01:45:16,643
But it was no sacrifice for me.

1184
01:45:17,478 --> 01:45:19,480
In prison you have no choice.

1185
01:45:20,767 --> 01:45:23,150
I didn't have the guts to let go.

1186
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:27,114
I felt you close to me,

1187
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:30,390
as if you were holding me,

1188
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:34,528
and I couldn't let go of you,

1189
01:45:35,808 --> 01:45:37,710
until you let go of me.

1190
01:45:42,882 --> 01:45:44,617
And then, one day

1191
01:45:47,667 --> 01:45:50,203
I could no longer remember your face.

1192
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:09,729
I'm finished with dreaming.

1193
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:52,865
Dorita!

1194
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:09,122
Dorita.

1195
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:14,361
Corazón.

1196
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:30,077
You taste like sugar cane juice.

1197
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:34,877
Papi.

1198
01:48:39,379 --> 01:48:41,448
Always he's looking for Cuba.
