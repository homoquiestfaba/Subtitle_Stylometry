1
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,520
Come on, dear. Wake up.

2
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,680
Teacher.

3
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,880
- Yes, honey ?
- I can't do this question.

4
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,440
OK, let's see what it says.

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,400
Which one of the following
statements is correct ?

6
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,880
NOAH LAND

7
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
Unlock it, son, will you ?

8
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
- It's already unlocked.
- Really ?

9
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,200
It does that sometimes.
There is a problem with the switch.

10
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
Sit in the back for now.
I'll fix it later.

11
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
Here.

12
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,640
Some chocolate.

13
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
- What's that ?
- Chocolate.

14
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,160
No, thanks. Not now.
Put it down there.

15
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,920
- Who is it ?
- It's me, son.

16
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,720
What's going on ?

17
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,520
What ? Are you in pain ?

18
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,640
- Didn't you bring your pills ?
- Can you take me for a drive ?

19
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,280
A drive ? We can go to
hospital if you like.

20
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,160
No. Fresh air and
a change of scene will help.

21
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Are you sure ?
You don't look good.

22
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
OK, fine.
I'll be right out.

23
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,760
What's going on ?
Why the crowds ?

24
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Stop up ahead there.

25
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,520
- You want me to stop ?
- Yes.

26
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
Stop, stop. Just here.

27
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,480
Where are we ?

28
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
I think I know.

29
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
This is the road up to our land.

30
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,920
What is this ? Why have we stopped ?
What's going on ?

31
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
- It's the road to our land.
- What ?

32
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,760
Yes, it's the road. Follow me.

33
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,000
- Water ! Cold water !
- Cold water !

34
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,600
Who are you ?

35
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
Who are you ?

36
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,640
Who are you ?

37
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
Who are you ? Come with me.

38
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,200
Let's find you some food.
He's some kind of purebred.

39
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
Selam aleykum.

40
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,840
- Aleykum selam.
- Aleykum selam, Uncle.

41
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,720
How are you, honey ?

42
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,680
Turn that toaster off.
Someone's left it on.

43
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,120
How are we doing, lads ?
How many pilgrims today ?

44
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,720
1896, Uncle.

45
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,560
Praise God !

46
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,720
Clear up this lot.
It looks bad for customers.

47
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,520
- Hello.
- Aleykum selam.

48
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
I'll have these.
It's Cevdet, isn't it ?

49
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,680
- Yes.
- I'm the son of Aziz Karamusa.

50
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
My name's Ibrahim.

51
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,480
Karamusa... Ah, yes.

52
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
- What can I do for you ?
- We arrived yesterday.

53
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,120
I know. I heard.

54
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm a sick man.
My days are numbered.

55
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,960
No ! May God heal you !
Where there's God, there's hope.

56
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,840
- How can I help ?
- My son's here with me.

57
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,200
I want to be buried
under the tree I planted as a boy.

58
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,000
That's why my son came.

59
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,520
Take your pick.
The trees belong to God.

60
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Those old feuds are history.

61
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,000
- Well...
- Forget the past.

62
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,720
- The tree on the hill.
- What, the poplar on Hoca Hill ?

63
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,120
No. The one everyone visits.

64
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,080
- The Noah Tree.
- That's the one.

65
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,120
- Yes ?
- I planted that tree.

66
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,760
- God forgive you !
- Someone's put up a prayer room there.

67
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
A fence, too.

68
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,120
Here's the title deed.
You can keep it. I have the original.

69
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,400
What are you talking about ?

70
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,640
If you'd clean up all the stakes
and ribbons there...

71
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,240
That tree is 4 000 years old.

72
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,440
- I'd appreciate it.
- Wait a second.

73
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,720
-What do you want with this Noah tree ?
- It's OK, it's nothing.

74
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,960
- Dad, I... Can we go outside ?
- Do you mind ?

75
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,960
- Dad, I...
- Do you mind ?

76
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Now, that tree is 49 years old,
not 4 000.

77
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
If you don't believe me,
count the age rings.

78
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,560
The tree doesn't age.
But what do you know about miracles ?

79
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,560
- Uncle, let me get rid of them.
- Take it easy. Sit down there.

80
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,200
Young fellow.

81
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,640
Take your father away. What
you're doing is a sin. Shame on you.

82
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,040
No, shame on you.
I planted that tree.

83
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
No ! The Prophet Noah planted it.

84
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,640
- Sit down.
- You have a nerve. Go fuck yourselves!

85
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,880
- Sit down and stop swearing !
- Don't swear !

86
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,080
- Come on, Dad.
- Wait, it's OK.

87
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,880
First of all, don't drag the Prophet's
name into your lies.

88
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,880
We're country folk,
but we're not stupid.

89
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,560
You have another agenda.

90
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,760
I don't. All I want is to be buried
under the tree I planted as a boy.

91
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,880
Second, this is the title deed
for Parcel No 54 in Zone 2.

92
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,600
- So what ?
- The tree is in Zone 3.

93
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,160
The back wall of the prayer room is
the boundary. Can you let me past ?

94
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,800
We own the whole of Parcel No 54.

95
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,560
You've got mixed up.
You planted the tree somewhere else.

96
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,920
I know exactly where
I planted the tree.

97
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,920
My friend, take your father away
before things get nasty.

98
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,240
- Bring the title deed and we'll talk.
- You have it !

99
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,800
Screw that !
He told you to get out, OK ?

100
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,560
Fuck off ! Shit-for-brains !
Sit down there !

101
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,640
Asshole !

102
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,200
- Wait !
- Come on, Dad !

103
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,560
- The title deed's right here.
- Go on, mister. Out of here.

104
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,720
God give me strength !

105
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,040
Get me some tea, nephew.

106
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,720
What are you trying to do ?

107
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,880
What you did back there
was shameful, Dad.

108
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,120
You ask me to bring you
to the village. I bring you.

109
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,520
You say they won't bury you
where you want.

110
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,240
So I drop everything
and come here with you.

111
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,720
I think maybe you have regrets.

112
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,480
But I see no fucking sign of regret.
Why are you like this, Dad ?

113
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,240
Why does the world
have to revolve around you ?

114
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,640
What makes you so great ?
What makes you so great, Dad ?

115
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
You don't give a fuck about anything !

116
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,400
Why go after the guys' holy place ?
What the fuck is Noah Tree anyway ?

117
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
What is Noah Tree ?

118
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,080
We came all this way.
Why didn't you tell me any of this ?

119
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,920
What kind of a man are you, Dad ?

120
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,200
Then you turn up with a title deed
like you're tricking a kid.

121
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,840
What's wrong with you, man ?

122
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,160
OK, you're sick. Everyone's sick.
Mum was sick, too.

123
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,880
Everyone has stuff going on.

124
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through ?

125
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I'm going through a divorce.

126
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,560
Motherfuckers !

127
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,360
Sons of bitches !

128
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,880
- What's wrong ?
- What the fuck is this ?

129
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,560
Motherfucking sons of bitches !

130
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,120
See what the fuckers have done.

131
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,760
Selam aleykum.
What's going on ?

132
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,960
Look at this.

133
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,880
Like you need to ask !
They've wrecked the fucking house.

134
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,880
God damn them !

135
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
That's too bad.

136
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,800
I'm the local imam.
I came to wish you welcome.

137
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Thanks.
They've wrecked the place, look.

138
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,480
Forgive them.
They don't know what they're doing.

139
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,200
They know damn well. It was deliberate.
This wasn't kids' doing.

140
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,520
They left shit all over the place.
It was totally deliberate.

141
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,400
Who did it ?

142
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,720
I don't know. God forbid !

143
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,440
But I've heard
what you said about the tree.

144
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,640
What ?

145
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,960
It's willful ignorance.
Why would the Ark be here, right ?

146
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,800
I've said so, but they
won't believe me either.

147
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
In the end, someone
must have planted that tree.

148
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,040
Exactly.

149
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
Is there a hose ? I'll help clean up.

150
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,880
The water isn't connected yet.

151
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,840
- I'll take care of that.
- I'll stick that hose up their asses.

152
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,480
- Anyway, I'm Ahmet.
- Ibrahim. And Ömer, my son.

153
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,040
This is my family's honey.
From Kars.

154
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
I hope you like it.

155
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,160
Just look at this.

156
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,160
His father was
the village head, too.

157
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,280
They'd stop at nothing
for a little bit of land.

158
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
We packed and left.

159
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,520
How did you two meet ?

160
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,680
Your wife.
Where did you meet her ?

161
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,160
On the cancer ward.

162
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,560
She's a nurse ?

163
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,600
- Her mum had cancer, too.
- I see.

164
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,520
What's her name ?

165
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,880
- What's her name ?
- Forget that. Just tell me this.

166
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,800
The land that tree is on,
are you sure your family owns it ?

167
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,000
- Yes, of course.
- Well, okay then.

168
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,920
We'll clear this up in a day or two.
It won't take long.

169
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,040
Let's go.

170
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,680
I understand,
I've just been there, sir.

171
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,680
But the gendarme commander
sent me here

172
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,280
saying it comes
under police jurisdiction.

173
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
And now you're saying the opposite.
What do I do ?

174
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,880
This is just a half-assed complaint.
Don't do this to me, please !

175
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,640
These things happen a lot
in the countryside.

176
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,280
Villagers have their own way of life.

177
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,040
- It's best not to interfere too much.
- OK, I get it.

178
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,880
Honey, careful. You'll fall.

179
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,320
How did it go ?

180
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,680
I just don't get it.

181
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,000
They say it's a disputed land
or something.

182
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,760
- Let's have your ID.
- What for ?

183
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,640
The land registry will know
who has jurisdiction.

184
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,040
Forget the trespassing thing.
What's done is done.

185
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,760
What's going on ?
The police were the same.

186
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,560
Forget it ? Why ? Forget what ?

187
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,440
They'll pay for what they did.

188
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,160
Whatever you've done, you pay for it.
For God's sake !

189
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,320
Great world we live in.

190
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,440
Our inspectors will come
to the village on the 23rd.

191
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,200
The 23rd ? Can't they come earlier ?

192
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,360
- I'm afraid not.
- Oh no !

193
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,160
Mister, can you hear me ?
Move back !

194
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,800
Breathe deeply. Deep breaths.
Can you hear me ?

195
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,560
Have you called an ambulance ?

196
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,400
Sorry to hear about your old man.

197
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,120
I hope he's recovering well.

198
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
- Things sure get around fast here.
- It's a small village.

199
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,440
I'll pray for the old man
after evening prayers, God willing.

200
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
Amen.

201
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,640
Selam aleykum. How are you ?

202
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,440
- Just fine.
- Praise be ! He looks good.

203
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,880
We have to put on one of the patches
the hospital gave you.

204
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,960
What patches ? I'm not in pain.
Come and have something to eat.

205
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,680
- Have some braised meat, Ahmet.
- Not for me, thanks.

206
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,040
But it's very good.

207
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,280
- I don't eat meat.
- Really ? Why ?

208
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,880
Long story.

209
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,120
Hello ? Give me a second.

210
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Wait, Hülya. There's no signal here.
I'll call you right back.

211
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,480
I'm going somewhere I can get a signal.
I'll be back soon.

212
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,640
Go that way, towards the field.
You'll get a signal there.

213
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,280
- Here.
- Thanks, that's great.

214
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,680
Yes, sir. OK, I'll do that.

215
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,000
The archive for that area
was damaged in the flood.

216
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,280
What flood ? No one told my dad
anything about a flood.

217
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,360
The building was apparently flooded.

218
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,400
Before my time here.
A big part of the archive was damaged.

219
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,680
- Which part ?
- The Noah Tree and surrounding area.

220
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,120
The Noah Tree and surrounding area ?

221
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,600
I'll get on your case, I warn you.
Believe me, it won't be pretty.

222
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,000
Are you fucking with me ?
What is this ?

223
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,520
Falsifying official documents,
withholding, altering or damaging them.

224
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,200
They're all crimes.
You know that, don't you ?

225
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,440
Don't go there.
You'll be in serious shit, I warn you.

226
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,920
Tell your manager I'll be back
on Monday. You hear ?

227
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,560
I'll be here on Monday.
Fuckers !

228
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Selam aleykum, fellows.

229
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,120
Could I have a tea ?

230
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,280
Thanks.

231
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
Remember me ?

232
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,120
Why do you want to be buried
under that tree ?

233
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Sorry if I crossed the line here.

234
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,120
You've never wanted
anything so badly ?

235
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,240
I mean, something you wanted badly
without knowing why.

236
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,360
I think rather than what we want,
how we want it is more important.

237
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,560
I'd be skeptical of anything that's not
what both heart and mind desire.

238
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,560
Skeptical, huh ?

239
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
I trust my heart completely.

240
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,480
In fact, I'd die if I stopped wanting.

241
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,280
May God put off that day.

242
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,920
- Have you fixed it ?
- It was exhausting.

243
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,200
I don't know if it'll work.

244
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
You've practically let the fire go out.

245
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,920
- Chestnuts ?
- Haven't you put them on yet ?

246
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,200
I've had an idea.

247
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
If we gave that archive clerk
some money,

248
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,080
wouldn't he solve
the title deed problem ?

249
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,040
- Forget it. Bribery is a sin.
- No, really ? Everyone does it.

250
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,240
But does that legitimize it ?

251
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm not giving anyone money.

252
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,120
You need to give money to get
your own title deed ? What a bullshit !

253
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,280
Asshole crooks !

254
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,880
May God keep you from bad language.

255
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,680
What's going on
at the entrance to the village ?

256
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,880
The digging there ?

257
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,920
- He means on the roadside.
- Right. What's that ?

258
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,040
The village head's project.
To stop winter snows closing the road.

259
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,080
When the road's closed,
pilgrims can't get to the tree.

260
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,440
He builds a road
because people can't get to the tree,

261
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,080
but the diggers smash
the roots of other trees.

262
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,840
You think he cares ?

263
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,520
Great !

264
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,840
- Who are we like ?
- What ?

265
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,520
Who do we want to be like
when we're solving a problem ?

266
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,800
That's what matters.

267
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,920
"In times of chaos,
it is better to sit than to stand

268
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,960
and better to stand than to walk."

269
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,080
OK, here's another quote
from the Prophet.

270
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,400
"He who is silent in the face
of injustice is a voiceless devil."

271
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,000
- Right ?
- But that's not what I said.

272
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,040
I'm saying make a stand,
talk, explain yourself,

273
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,600
convince one another.

274
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,200
Persuading people and all that...

275
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,800
Sorry, but it's bullshit.
Persuasion doesn't work.

276
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,680
Talking can't teach anyone anything.

277
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,760
It's actions that matter, not words.

278
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,640
Actions, what you do.
Those actions define you.

279
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,600
Have there never been times
when you've thought...

280
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,600
"Hell, I wish I hadn't done
what I did there."

281
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,600
How many people have you hurt,
for example ?

282
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,800
In what ways have you been selfish,
for example ?

283
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,520
I may not be talking about regrets,

284
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,640
but is there nothing you thought
you could've done differently ?

285
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,720
- Have you never had times like that ?
- Not me.

286
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,760
Well, Dad. That's great.

287
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Aren't you the lucky one !

288
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

289
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,680
Did I do something wrong
without realizing ?

290
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,880
I don't know.

291
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,640
I don't know the man any better than
you. I don't know what upsets him.

292
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
I'm just getting to know him.

293
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,400
Forget what he says about the tree.

294
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,640
Let's find a spot in the cemetery
and give him a normal burial.

295
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,720
That can be arranged.

296
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,680
Good.

297
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm cold. I'm going inside.

298
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,040
No. You remember it wrong.

299
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,080
We played somewhere else,
not on Noah Hill.

300
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Remember lame Rüstem's field ?
We played there.

301
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,320
Can I get you another tea ?

302
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,040
No.

303
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,560
We'll resolve the few remaining issues
with your help, God willing !

304
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,520
It's no big deal. Nothing's a big deal
as long as you're around. Thank you.

305
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,760
Why don't I take you to my place
for some tea ?

306
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,600
- No. I'm fine here.
- But please.

307
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,840
It'll be a break for everyone.

308
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,320
- My wife's baked pastries especially.
- We have to get to the next village.

309
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
Mr. District Governor,
can I say something ?

310
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Go ahead.

311
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,560
I'm Ibrahim Bastürk.
From this village.

312
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,400
In fact it was me who planted
their so-called Noah Tree.

313
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,240
For goodness sake !

314
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,760
Years ago, there was a territorial
dispute between the two families.

315
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,080
We had to leave the village
as a result.

316
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,720
I say I planted the tree,
but no one believes me.

317
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
But never mind that.

318
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,160
The land that the tree is on
belongs to my family.

319
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,200
We've asked the land registry
for the title deed,

320
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,080
but they say
there was a flood in the archive.

321
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,240
So, could I perhaps ask you...

322
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,840
to give the word
for that title deed to be found ?

323
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,000
If something happens to me,
I'll hold them responsible.

324
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,920
Don't worry, sir.
I won't let anything happen to you.

325
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,120
Don't worry, they're good people.

326
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,720
Write a petition for the title deed.
And my people will take care of you.

327
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
Actually, the thing is...
Actually, we already filed a petition.

328
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,360
He's upset about a bygone issue.
I'm sorry, he's giving you a headache.

329
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,480
This woman came by.

330
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,840
And ?

331
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,080
She said she was pregnant.

332
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,600
And that it was thanks to the tree.

333
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
I need lemon.

334
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,680
- Lemon.
- Lemon ?

335
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,720
- Where are they ?
- On top of the fridge.

336
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,640
- How many do you want ?
- One.

337
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,440
Thanks.

338
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,480
The woman's a teacher, though.

339
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,680
The village teacher.

340
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
Must've been a coincidence.

341
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,680
She said people need hope.

342
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,280
She said to leave the tree alone.

343
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,720
What do you think we should do ?

344
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,840
You're asking me ?

345
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,640
Why's the tree
so important to you ?

346
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,040
Father, was it really you
who planted it ?

347
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,440
Why would I lie to you ?

348
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,840
Did you plant it or not ?

349
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,400
- Was that a yes ?
- Yes.

350
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,600
Were you alone ?
Was there anyone with you ?

351
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,960
My father was there.

352
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,360
Ömer, it looks pretty full here.

353
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,640
There should be more space over there.
Shall we take a look ?

354
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,280
Selim ! Yavuz ! Uncle Cevdet !

355
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,440
The Noah Tree !

356
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,360
- What the hell is going on ?
- The Noah Tree !

357
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,200
- What's going on ?
- Uncle, the Noah Tree ! Quick !

358
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,920
What the fuck are you doing ?

359
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,240
This place has to be cleared !
You have to clear all these fences !

360
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,240
- Get off !
- I want the place spotless.

361
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,880
Get off !

362
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,840
Fuck you ! You fucker !

363
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,320
What the fuck are you doing ?
Fucking cunts !

364
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
- What the fuck are you doing ?
- Ömer !

365
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,400
- Get off !
- Ömer !

366
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,960
What's going on ? Fucking cunts !

367
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,600
Who planted this tree ?

368
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,960
- Who planted this tree ?
- Go !

369
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,720
- Who planted this tree ?
- Read the board.

370
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,920
- Get these bastards out of here !
- Who ? I planted this tree !

371
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,000
I planted it !

372
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,280
Keep out of our village,
godless bastards !

373
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,440
- To hell with your religion !
- Fuck off !

374
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,640
- Ömer !
- OK. Go !

375
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,360
If you touch a hair on my son's head,
I'll fuck each and every one of you !

376
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,680
My days are numbered. I'll burn down
the tree, then the village.

377
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,640
Take your father away.
You'll turn the tree against us.

378
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,800
We don't even pick the fruit
for fear of hurting it.

379
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,520
Shame on you !

380
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,920
- Uncivilized bastards !
- Uncle, these men...

381
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,360
I'll beat you up ! Enough !

382
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,360
Enough !

383
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,600
Come on, put them back !

384
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,400
Enough !

385
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,400
Enough already !

386
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,880
Come on, let's go !

387
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,480
Bastards ! Move !

388
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,600
I told you guys a thousand times
not to curse in front of me !

389
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,160
Son.

390
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,800
Do you blame me
for your mother's death ?

391
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,840
I didn't do anything bad by leaving.

392
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,560
Maybe I even did a good thing.

393
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,920
I spared your mum and you from the
trouble of living with a man like me.

394
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,960
You see what I mean ?

395
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,520
You might even thank me
for it one day.

396
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,080
Sometimes parents have to wait for
their kids to grow up,

397
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,320
only then they can understand
their parents. Cruel, isn't it ?

398
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,040
I wasn't a good father.

399
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,400
But if I'd stayed, I wouldn't
have been a good father either.

400
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,640
I'm not a bad person, son.

401
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,720
But you can't be angry at a man who's
aware of his inadequacy.

402
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,720
All you can do is to pity him.

403
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,920
You're so stuck in the past
that you can't live the moment.

404
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,280
You can't live the future.

405
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,480
Look who's talking !

406
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,760
Aren't you here
to avenge the past, Dad ?

407
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,000
Revenge ?

408
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,640
No. There's a very fine line
between revenge and justice.

409
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,040
I'm here for justice.

410
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,480
- So you don't care about the tree.
- That's not what I said.

411
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
That's not what I said.

412
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,520
What's going to happen
with this hate of yours ?

413
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,320
Why do we have to just love or hate ?

414
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,360
Why do we have to be stuck
in these two extremes ?

415
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,920
Is it so hard to be
somewhere in the middle ?

416
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,640
Stop looking at me
like I killed your mother.

417
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,360
It has nothing to do with Mum.

418
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,440
Everyone dies. We all will.
It's not about that.

419
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,000
It kills me that you made Mum and me
crawl to those shitty uncles.

420
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,200
It kills me that they'd sit
in front of us swinging their dicks.

421
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,080
They ruled my entire life
just because they had more money.

422
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,160
I was such a smart, sweet kid.

423
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,560
I was so gifted.
But those fuckers screwed it all up.

424
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
Mum didn't even open her mouth.

425
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,480
They've turned me into
this rude, intolerant man.

426
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,920
Still to this day
those assholes invade my dreams.

427
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,800
I yell, I scream,
but no sound comes out, Dad.

428
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,840
Then I wake up crying. I'm 41 !

429
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,840
Dad, I'm 41 years old.
And I'm still dealing with this shit.

430
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,280
Mum wasn't there, I was all alone
and you'd already fucked off.

431
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,960
I was so mean to Mum.

432
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,760
All the resentment, the anger,
the hate I had towards you...

433
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,520
I threw it all in her face.
Every day.

434
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,160
I didn't say a single nice word to her.
Right up until she died.

435
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,880
Do you understand that, Dad ?

436
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,800
Mum died in my arms.

437
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,320
She died in my arms.

438
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,920
Her body went cold in my arms.

439
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,040
Her feet used to freeze
so I'd massage them every night.

440
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,760
And this woman was always
looking me in the eye.

441
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,360
She kept looking me in the eye
so I'd say something nice, Dad.

442
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,600
I didn't say one nice word to her.

443
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,360
She always had a look that said,
"Son, it's not my fault."

444
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,880
I hurt her so badly, Dad

445
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,280
Who am I supposed to apologize to now ?

446
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,160
Who am I supposed to apologize to now ?

447
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,760
And you stand there
saying I'll thank you.

448
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,200
I'll never thank you.

449
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,080
Wait, what are you doing ? Stop !
I'm backing up the car.

450
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,080
Go back !

451
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,560
Hey, I'm backing up the car !
Go back.

452
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,400
Selam aleykum.
What's going on ?

453
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,080
Aleykum selam. It's a dead end.
Drive by or let me back up the hill.

454
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,960
If you take country roads you don't
know you'll get stuck, God forbid.

455
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,560
Everything happens for a reason.
So now we're here, let's have a chat.

456
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,600
- I can't. I'm in a hurry.
- Come on.

457
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,440
- Come on, it'll be fine.
- Let me just...

458
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,080
Come down here.
Look, the Lord's blessed us with rain.

459
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,120
Let's get wet in this holy rain.

460
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,160
How are you ?

461
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,920
Fine, thanks. How are you ?

462
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,720
- I'm fine, too, thanks.
- So, go ahead.

463
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,680
I just wanted to apologize for
what happened that morning.

464
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,680
Hard to keep young men in line,
you know.

465
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,960
It's fine. I'm sorry, too. I lost
it when I saw my father like that.

466
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,040
Well, who wouldn't ?

467
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,840
I won't drag this out in the rain.

468
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,280
I'll get right to the point
if that's OK.

469
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,600
Let's say the land the tree is on
belongs to your father's family.

470
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,560
I haven't seen the title deed yet,
but let's just say it does.

471
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,480
We've looked after the land
last 50 years.

472
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,920
Who's plowed the soil,
who's watered it ? We have.

473
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,480
To put it another way,
we're the father of the child.

474
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,600
Now, a man turns up after 50 years
saying he's the father of the child.

475
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,920
I mean, if you're
the father of the child,

476
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,320
why haven't you been
to see that child in 50 years ?

477
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,640
If you planted the tree,

478
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,840
why haven't you given it
a drop of water in 50 years ?

479
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,280
Look.

480
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,320
Didn't this same man
leave you and your mother

481
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,280
and go chasing after
another woman in Paris ?

482
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,800
I don't think you should go there.
That stuff is personal.

483
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,680
We don't know
what kind of life the man had there,

484
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,920
or what he had to deal with. Do we ?
Sorry, but we can't judge him on that.

485
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,360
- And you, least of all. Sorry.
- Sorry, it just slipped out.

486
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,480
Forgive me.

487
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,880
Anyway, my point is this.

488
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,120
Your father could well pass away soon,
though may God put off the day.

489
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,280
You'll leave the village
and never come back. I know it.

490
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,040
You're having a child.

491
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,800
I heard. I was also sorry to hear
you're getting divorced.

492
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,840
You'll have a lot of expenses.

493
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:57,200
So let me give you half the money
in the account we opened for the tree.

494
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,840
It's a sizeable sum.

495
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,720
Make a nice life for yourself.

496
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,000
Buy nice things for your child.

497
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:10,160
Go and buy yourself
a nice house in Istanbul. Make a home.

498
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,440
But just leave this village and the
Noah Tree alone, my friend. Please !

499
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,040
You think it over, OK ?

500
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,720
Goodbye and God bless !

501
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,600
Look.

502
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,560
I planned to use this thing to cut a
wedge from the tree. For the age rings.

503
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,360
I wanted to show you the tree's age,
but then I couldn't do it.

504
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,920
- You couldn't do it ?
- No. They say it can kill a tree.

505
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,240
Dad, why bother with this stuff ?
It doesn't matter anymore.

506
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,000
It does. It does to me.

507
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,560
Do you believe I planted the tree ?

508
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,760
Look, Dad. Isn't the land yours ?
Isn't it owned by your family ?

509
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,640
The tree is yours, too.
You can do what you like with it.

510
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,800
Do you believe I planted it or not ?

511
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,240
Shall I put some more wood on ?

512
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,400
Hello ?

513
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,080
Hello. I was looking for Ömer.
They directed me to this house.

514
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,720
Yes ?

515
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,560
Are you his father ?

516
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,280
Yes.

517
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,200
He said such bad things about you.
I always pictured you as a monster.

518
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,320
Turns out I'm human, though, huh ?

519
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,480
I always believe the opposite of
anything Ömer says.

520
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,520
I'm Elif.

521
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,920
- Ömer's ex-wife.
- Ibrahim. Nice to meet you.

522
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,680
You, too.

523
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,920
Of course, he didn't tell you
he'd soon be a father either.

524
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,640
He likes secrets.

525
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,640
Elif ?

526
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,640
You must have things to talk about.

527
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,760
- It's OK by me. You can stay.
- No, no. I was going to...

528
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,440
I'll go and do that now.

529
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,320
So, how are you doing ?

530
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,360
- Fine.
- Have a seat. Or we can...

531
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,880
No need.

532
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,080
Let's sit through there.
It's warmer.

533
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,440
OK.

534
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,640
Is it warm enough ?

535
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,400
- I can put more wood on.
- No.

536
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,480
- Have a seat.
- No, I have someone waiting.

537
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,880
Who's the someone ?

538
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,920
My boyfriend.

539
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,600
- Your boyfriend ?
- Why not ?

540
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,920
You're kidding.

541
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,720
What boyfriend ?

542
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,880
You know I'm slow at these things.

543
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,520
Besides, what would anyone want
with a woman so pregnant ?

544
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,680
How did you get here ?

545
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,320
- By car.
- By car.

546
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,800
But who told you I was here ?

547
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,840
Ömer, isn't why I'm here
more important ?

548
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,120
No. That you're here is important.
That you're standing here now.

549
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,560
Have a seat.

550
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,560
Water ? Tea ?
Can I get you a tea ?

551
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,360
'The Idiot', huh ?

552
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,360
Finally.

553
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,720
Yes. I finished it.

554
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,760
Good.

555
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,960
- Ömer, why are you here ?
- How do you mean ?

556
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,480
Isn't this the man
you conveniently blame

557
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,560
for everything that's gone wrong
in your life ?

558
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,760
Didn't you even try to pin
our failed relationship on him ?

559
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,200
- It's those looks again.
- What looks ?

560
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,320
Those judging looks.

561
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,920
I guess I miss them. Even them.

562
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,800
My dad's dying, Elif.

563
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,680
I'm here to bury him.

564
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,200
There's a place he wants to be buried.
It's a bit problematic.

565
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,640
He can't handle it all alone.
I have to be here for him. He needs me.

566
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,040
Shall I tell you why
you're really here ?

567
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,000
Go on, tell me.

568
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,640
You'd rather express your hate
than come into an unimaginable fortune.

569
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,000
You're only here to pity your dad,

570
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,920
to enjoy pitying him,
to express your hate, that's all.

571
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,560
Doesn't that also explain
your sudden surge of paternal feeling ?

572
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,520
What explains it ?

573
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,920
You know what ?

574
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,160
You wouldn't do anything
for anyone else

575
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,800
unless there is something
in it for you.

576
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,040
You couldn't.

577
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,840
Why are you being so hard ?

578
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,720
Why are you so pushy ?

579
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,000
Why are you always telling
me what to do ?

580
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,720
Why are you telling me how to act ?

581
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,080
Can't you just let go ?
Accept me as I am. Please !

582
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,240
Do you realize
you're always telling me what to do ?

583
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,320
Stop !

584
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,920
Sometimes I can't bring myself
to do things you want me to do

585
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,320
just because you've told me
to do them. And I don't.

586
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,960
Don't you realize that, Elif ?

587
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,000
I always feel like
I'm doing everything wrong

588
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,160
I'm so tired of wondering
what it is I'm doing wrong this time.

589
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,680
I can't tell you how bad that feels,
Elif.

590
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,480
- OK, Ömer. Enough.
- No !

591
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,960
- We're not done. I want to talk.
- Really ?

592
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,280
Then answer me this:

593
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,400
Who's going to breastfeed the baby
when it's born. You ?

594
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,480
Did I say that, for God's sake ?

595
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,080
Then tell your lawyer
not to file for custody.

596
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,640
- She will.
- What ?

597
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,360
She will !

598
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,720
This is the only thing in my life
that's been mine.

599
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,000
I won't let you snatch it
away from me.

600
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,600
This child will admire me.
I want her to admire me.

601
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,040
What are you talking about ?
You're being truly ridiculous.

602
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,400
Please talk to your lawyer.

603
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,680
And by the way, that Hülya
fancies you. Take it from me.

604
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,000
What ?

605
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,040
Hülya fancies...

606
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,400
OK. Really, that's enough.
Talk to your lawyer.

607
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,160
These aren't things
to be discussed in a hurry.

608
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,120
Please, Elif. Sit down.
I'm begging you.

609
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,880
Let's make tea. Let's have tea.
Let's talk. Let's look at one another.

610
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,280
OK.

611
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,120
- Great !
- There, I'm sitting down.

612
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,880
So, let's talk. What about ?

613
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,360
What's left to talk about ?

614
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,960
Ömer, what's left to talk about ?

615
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,880
Please. Don't do this.

616
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,160
If you care at all,

617
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,360
keep the baby out of
your issues with the past.

618
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,280
Surprise me just for once.
Please !

619
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,400
- One day you'll apologize to me, Elif.
- Why's that ?

620
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,320
You'll apologize to me.

621
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,880
I can see it in your eyes.

622
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,280
You'll apologize to me.
For everything you've done to me.

623
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,800
You'll apologize
for making me like this.

624
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:26,720
I put you at the center of my life.
You'll apologize for not staying there.

625
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,760
Our relationship could've been
in a very different place.

626
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,040
You'll apologize for not allowing it.

627
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,920
You'll apologize for
making me a man you hate

628
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,800
when you could've loved me.

629
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,200
You'll apologize for taking that ring
off your finger so fast, Elif.

630
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,000
You know what I'll do then ?

631
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,920
I'll accept all your apologies.

632
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,280
Because that's the way I am.

633
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,400
I told you something, remember ?

634
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,360
My tolerance will save
our relationship, Elif.

635
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,880
Can I have a word with you ?

636
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,440
Surely a grown man doesn't
need permission to speak to me.

637
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,720
- We can talk right there.
- OK.

638
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,000
Son of a...

639
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,600
So stubborn...

640
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,240
- I found this.
- Good.

641
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,440
It's stuck.

642
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,720
Take these.

643
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,880
- I guess that's enough.
- Thanks.

644
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,120
My back hurts anyway.

645
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,160
- Dad.
- Huh ?

646
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,040
- What did you and Elif talk about ?
- She just apologized.

647
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,840
- She apologized ?
- Yes.

648
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,280
- Why ?
- She called me a monster, remember ?

649
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,880
- You didn't talk about anything else ?
- No.

650
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,080
You seemed to be talking for longer.

651
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,480
Well, there was the before and after,
nothing to speak of.

652
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,520
Just the usual civilities,
"How are you ?" and so on, that's all.

653
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,480
Dad, leave it there.
I'll take it in.

654
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,680
- No, it's OK.
- I have more to chop anyway.

655
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,320
It's fine.

656
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,360
OK.

657
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,880
OK. I see.

658
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,120
But who wants those documents ?

659
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,520
No, I mean why do they want them ?
Is it the court ?

660
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,320
OK, I'll handle it.

661
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,000
I'll take care of it.

662
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,800
Hülya, can I call you back later ?

663
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,280
The land registry guys are here.
I'll call you back. OK, bye.

664
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,160
What's going on ?

665
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,560
What the hell is this ?

666
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,520
Was it you who sent the officers away ?
Fuck you !

667
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,040
Get out of here !
Fuck-faces ! Fuck you !

668
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,640
Ömer !

669
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,440
- Fuck !
- Son, are you OK ?

670
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,280
Dad, what are you doing there ?
Get out of the way !

671
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,480
Fuckers ! Break it all, fuckers !

672
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,640
Break it all, motherfuckers !
Sons of bitches !

673
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,280
Fucking bastards !

674
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,800
No, there's no one here.

675
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,120
- Where are you going ?
- To cut down the tree.

676
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,680
No, don't !

677
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,240
Ömer ! Don't do it !

678
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,120
- No, this shit has to end tonight.
- Don't do it.

679
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,840
- Fuck that tree.
- Don't. Don't touch their tree.

680
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,800
Touch whose tree ? The tree's yours,
Dad !

681
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,080
No, no.
I don't want the tree anymore.

682
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,440
That's over. I gave up.

683
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,120
Ömer, don't.
They'll do something to you.

684
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,200
Don't cut it down, Ömer !

685
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,600
Son ! Don't !

686
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,800
You'll get in trouble because of me !
Don't ! Ömer !

687
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,520
Ömer, don't !

688
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,960
Dad ?
Dad, are you OK ?

689
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,880
What shall we do, Dad ?
What shall I do ?

690
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,080
It's OK. I'll be fine.

691
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,240
This soup is looking good.

692
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,640
Dad, it's freezing in here.
I'm closing this, OK ?

693
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,640
- OK.
- That's enough air.

694
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,240
You know what ?

695
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,400
There was a rock by the tree
I planted.

696
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,440
I've looked,
but can't see a rock there.

697
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,560
I don't think it's the tree I planted.

698
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,200
For God's sake, Dad !
No rock hangs around for 50 years.

699
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,440
Anyway they put that prayer room there.
The rock could be underneath.

700
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,680
Relax.
I'm not going to touch the tree.

701
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,680
Bury me in the small cemetery.

702
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,920
- Your soup will get cold.
- Never mind the soup.

703
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,240
- OK ?
- Is what OK ?

704
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,640
That you bury me
in the small cemetery.

705
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,760
Dad, OK.
But do you have to pick now...

706
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,920
Is that a real OK ?

707
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,960
OK.

708
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,840
When I was in Istanbul,
I visited your mother's grave.

709
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,200
Before coming to you.

710
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,680
I'm putting a lot of lemon in here,
OK ?

711
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,840
I'll squeeze this one as well.
It'll be quite sour,

712
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,360
but the bread will counter that.
I'll crumble the bread into it.

713
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,240
You need to get this soup down.

714
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,960
You'll be a good father.

715
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,640
That's so weird.

716
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,080
Mum said the same thing.

717
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,120
She said the same thing
in the same circumstances.

718
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,680
She said I'd be a good father.

719
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,440
I'll be a good father, huh ?

720
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,360
I won't be anything.

721
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,600
- Huh ?
- I won't be anything.

722
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,960
Why do you say that ?

723
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,640
Eat your soup.

724
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,960
Is he asleep or something ?

725
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,720
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.

726
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,320
I've brought the window-man from town.
Let's get this lot fixed, my friend.

727
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,040
- Thanks. There was no need, though.
- No, it's fine.

728
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,920
Nihat is from the village.

729
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,520
Shame on you. Assholes !

730
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,200
Dad, are you OK ?

731
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,320
Dad ?

732
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,680
I had a car like this in France.

733
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,400
Not quite the same, but...

734
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,040
Are you happy with it ?

735
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,320
- Sure, I guess I'm happy with it.
- It's a good car.

736
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,640
- Are you feeling any better ?
- Fine, yes. Better. This helps.

737
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,040
Look. Look over there.

738
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,600
That's where we used
to play as kids.

739
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,600
See that button ?
You can heat the seat.

740
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,800
I've already switched it on.

741
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,480
Look, they're both on.
But there's no one to sit there.

742
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,200
Seeing as you have the heat on,
I'll come and get my ass warm.

743
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,400
I thought about doing that, too,
but I didn't dare.

744
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,680
Look... Mr. Tahsin and Mrs. Bedriye
used to live over there.

745
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,800
It's a wreck now.

746
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,120
Those were the days...

747
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,240
- Are you hungry ?
- No, I'm fine.

748
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,440
We can go find some soup if you like.

749
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,560
- There'll be somewhere open, Dad.
- OK. We can have a look.

750
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,000
Fuck !

751
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,720
- What's the matter ?
- Something got into my eye.

752
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,720
- The ceiling's falling down.
- That'll do.

753
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,760
- It won't hold, though.
- It will.

754
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,280
- Fine, give me that.
- Here.

755
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,680
She said you're helping me here
to prove to me, to her and to yourself

756
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,840
that you aren't a selfish person
like me.

757
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,560
That's why you've come
to the village, she said.

758
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,440
What ?

759
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,320
And that's why
you want the child so badly.

760
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,680
According to her,
that's totally selfish.

761
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,200
She said you didn't even want the child
at first. You wanted an abortion.

762
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,200
- I didn't want the child ?
- Uh-huh.

763
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,320
- Did she really say that, Dad ?
- Yes.

764
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,600
She said I didn't want the child ?

765
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,560
I never said anything like that.

766
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,560
Did I ?

767
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,040
I never said that.

768
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,720
It can't be that complicated.

769
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,480
This didn't plant it. That didn't
plant it. So who the fuck did ?

770
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,400
My Dad then.

771
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,240
- That's what he says.
- OK, but why do you believe him ?

772
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,280
He's always contradicting himself.

773
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,920
The other day he said
he didn't care about the tree.

774
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,720
Who knows ?

775
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,800
Ibrahim is... an interesting man.
A complex man.

776
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,120
I think he's afraid.

777
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,240
He's afraid of the villagers.

778
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,960
He's afraid they'll do something
to me.

779
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,600
That's why he acts the way he does.

780
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,440
Last summer I told the kids
that Noah's Ark never came here.

781
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,320
Then the parents didn't send their kids
to Quran classes rest of the summer.

782
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,800
I'm an imam.
It's my duty to share the truth.

783
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,160
I also told the village council
when I first arrived.

784
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,840
They told me to stop interpreting
the Quran arbitrarily.

785
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,760
They ignored me.
I'll fix this.

786
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,560
And I'm going to stick that title deed
up their asses.

787
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,840
May God keep you from bad language.
Hey, you won't play with me ?

788
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,840
They say everything was damaged
in the flood. The entire archive.

789
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,040
That's not true.
There was hardly any damage.

790
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,200
A couple of tons of coal
were damaged, that's all.

791
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,760
- Coal ?
- Yes.

792
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,040
- So the archive wasn't damaged ?
- No, there was no damage.

793
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,400
Not as far as I know.

794
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,600
- How much do you get paid ?
- Why do you want to know ?

795
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,640
Thanks. You're a star.

796
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,120
He's a great kid.

797
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,360
- There you go, Dad.
- Thanks.

798
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,920
- How old is he ?
- Ten.

799
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,120
Don't worry,
I work in the public sector too.

800
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,000
Just tell me how much you earn.

801
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,200
Enough to get by.

802
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,760
- The minimum wage.
- The minimum wage ?

803
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,640
- Do you want to make some money ?
- How ?

804
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,360
No, don't. Don't.

805
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,360
Take it. Go on.

806
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,760
Don't leave me hanging here.
Come on, take it.

807
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,520
I'll explain in a second.

808
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,120
So you know the archive ?

809
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,960
Get me a copy of our title deed
from the archive. OK ?

810
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,880
Get the copy and I'll give you
the same again. OK ?

811
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,520
- You're back ?
- What's up ?

812
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,360
Tayfun called.

813
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,960
He mentioned a new drug,
some new procedure.

814
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:48,080
He's used it on a few patients, says
it works well, halts growth and so on.

815
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,080
- I'll be kept in for a few nights.
- Who's Tayfun ?

816
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,680
My doctor. The one in Istanbul.

817
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,280
- Isn't your doctor in France ?
- No.

818
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,040
That's Pierre's friend.
Sure, he's in France, but Tayfun...

819
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,440
- Didn't I tell you ?
- No.

820
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,720
They went to graduate school together.

821
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,280
He said to see him
when I was back in Turkey.

822
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,880
Which I did before coming to you.

823
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,280
He said I should give it a try,
that it could help a lot.

824
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,720
- He'll try out the new drug ?
- Uh- huh.

825
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,480
- That's great.
- Isn't it ?

826
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,200
That's fantastic news, Dad.

827
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,000
- Let's go now.
- Not on the country roads at night.

828
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,560
There's no need.
We'll go in the morning.

829
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,720
OK, fine. I'll go and pack a bag.

830
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:40,560
- OK. Let's have something to eat.
- OK. I'm all done here anyway.

831
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,280
Look after the dog, OK ?

832
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,200
Let me give you this, too.
You can give the meat to someone else.

833
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,120
OK. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

834
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,000
I'll be back in the morning
to see you off.

835
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,160
- Good night.
- Good night.

836
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,920
Hey, boy. What happened to you ?

837
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,800
What happened to you, handsome ?

838
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,920
Who tied you up here ?

839
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,840
Wait, handsome. Let's untie you.

840
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,560
Come on, Cemal ! Let's go !

841
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,280
Selam aleykum.
Have you seen my father ?

842
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:05,360
Hilmi !

843
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,360
Round everyone up !

844
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,480
Let's check The Deep Valley.

845
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,880
Let's go !

846
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,640
I'm half-tempted not to bury Dad.

847
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,280
To leave him to rot
in the living room at home.

848
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,080
And let the whole village
reek of death.

849
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,000
So that those assholes
can't sleep because of the reek.

850
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,760
So that they remember
the outrage they committed.

851
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,400
So that they feel guilty
every time they smell it.

852
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,640
Sons of bitches.

853
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,920
Sons of bitches.

854
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,800
I'm not burying my Dad.

855
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,240
I'll toss his body
into the living room,

856
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,600
lock the doors and fuck off.
That's justice.

857
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,160
We must leave justice to God, Ömer.

858
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,120
What you said isn't right.

859
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,440
Let's just find Ibrahim first.

860
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,720
Then we can give him
a ritual burial, God willing.

861
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,160
Maybe the villagers
did something to Ibrahim.

862
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,160
No, what would they do ?

863
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,960
- He tied up the dog and left.
- But why did he tie up the dog ?

864
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,520
Why ? So it didn't follow him.

865
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,680
Mr. Ömer, this is the last place
we'll be looking on land.

866
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,160
I hope we'll have success.

867
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,320
Carry on in line !

868
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,880
- Yes ?
- So... I couldn't do it.

869
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,360
I'm sorry.

870
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:05,040
Sorry. I'm kind of dizzy.
Just a second.

871
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,960
- It's OK. Keep it.
- No, out of the question.

872
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,120
- It's OK. Keep it.
- No, I can't.

873
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,320
- Hello.
- Hello ?

874
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,200
Elif ?

875
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,560
What's up, Ömer ?
You know what the time is ?

876
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,400
Elif, Dad is dead.

877
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,600
Come here, my dear.

878
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:34,240
- It's okay. Come here, sweetie.
- Shall I take the baby, ma'am ?

879
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,200
No.

880
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,200
I'm sorry for your loss.

881
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,360
Would you like us to come over ?

882
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,680
Ömer ?

883
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,520
Can you hear me ?

884
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,960
Ömer...

885
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,520
NOAH LAND
