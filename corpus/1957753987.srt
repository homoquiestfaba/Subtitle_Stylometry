00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,039
come on let's pray
jesus we just ask

295
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,078
that you're

296
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,199
with us through all
of this that you

297
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,119
forgive our sin

298
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,638
and you give us mercy
for today in jesus

299
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
name

300
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
amen

301
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,799
scott it's the pastor

302
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,638
what the pastor he's the thief

303
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,999
come on sir why would
you say something

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,078
like that i mean he's a pastor

305
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,759
i'm serious jay why

306
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,599
well why not his wife's sick

307
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,039
he doesn't have the
money he needs it

308
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,278
so just because a
man's wife is sick and

309
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,039
he doesn't have money
doesn't mean he's

310
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,239
going to steal it

311
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,759
besides he's a pastor
i mean he's not

312
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,198
alone in his circumstances

313
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,799
the wall is full

314
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,479

Only has bible study

so you think
there's some sort of

330
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,638

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,879

409
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,279
pastor thomas's sister-in-law

410
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,160

no no

415
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,558
i actually wish i
could have seen the

416
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,719
look on the pastor's face

417
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,599
he was shaking i bet
he was what did you

418
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,678
do

419
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,279
So i walked up right
and i pulled my

420
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,160
dress

421
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:44,799
man oh man tell me don't show me

422
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,159
jeez look i hope the
man gets what you

423
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,039
deserve

424
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,279
well we can't say
that until we catch

425
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,759
him and and prove him guilty

426
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,719
right scott i'll
make sure and do

427
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,440
anything

428
00:19:57,441 --> 00:20:00,159
to see he does listen
i'll be there to

429
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
catch you

430
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:05,038
anytime you mess that up again

431
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,839
something or
something let it out

432
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,959
i'm thinking i need
to be playing on the

433
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,399
inside

434
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,959
that doesn't sound
like a good idea

435
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,600
don't you

436
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:19,359
think the pastor
won't recognize as you

437
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,959
that almost shot
his sister i didn't

438
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,919
almost

439
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,439
you know what whatever
well no matter

440
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,359
what he'll notice you

441
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,359
besides i need you
here in this case

442
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,798
yeah but we can't
keep working the case

443
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,918
from the outside

444
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,359
i mean we need
someone on the inside

445
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,279

now aaron are we
going to make budget

502
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,599
with all this
expansion that we need

503
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,199
the way we've been
growing we know we

504
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,719
need a new nursery we're just at

505
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,798
capacity and we can't
hold them anymore

506
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,319
yes giving is up
currently we are 85

507
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,479
of our budget pastor
i don't know how

508
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,678
you do it but

509
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,918
these people love
you probably more so

510
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,119
your wife

511
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,239
i think definitely
more so my wife well

512
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,839
let's just keep
building on our end for

513
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,519
sure so tiffany give
us an update on the

514
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,080
media

515
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,558
well for starters
the switchboard is

516
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,079
about to call it quits

517
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,239
it's two cameras
not working and that

518
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,999
sound board is archaic

519
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,918
okay well thank you for being so

520
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,999
positive

521
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,839
i'm just being honest
just stating the

522
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,278
facts okay

523
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,519
that's true but what
are we going to do

524
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,320
about it

525
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:02,798
well i asked aaron
for some funds and

526
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,319
she was saying that
it's not in the

527
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,319
budget it's not in the budget

528
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,639
is there any wiggle
room in this budget

529
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,158
honestly pastor no

530
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,239
we've used all of
our excess on that

531
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,359
nursery project

532
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,918
well maybe we can
fund that project with

533
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,519
the excess overflow

534
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,359
for this project i
mean but the only

535
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,719
problem with that
would be we'll be

536
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
waiting

537
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,599
because waiting
would mean that we

538
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,359
wouldn't be able to
livestream services

539
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,719
for at least

540
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,558
two to three weeks
and that's a good

541
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,918
point

542
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,239
so what are we gonna
do we're going to

543
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,439
trust god

544
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,759
that he's always
provided for me he's

545
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,199
always provided for my wife

546
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,798
and he's always
provided for my family

547
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,479
and i know if he's
done it for us

548
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,999
he's going to do it
for the church too

549
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,999
amen amen amen all
right now i want to

550
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,439
introduce you ladies to somebody

551
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,558

well there have been
some robberies in

574
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,918
the city and the
police department is

575
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,439
working really hard
to try to figure

576
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,400
this thing out

577
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:37,119
detective scott said
the last robbery

578
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,879
happened closer to
our neighborhood and

579
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,319
he just wanted us
to know so that we

580
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,079
wouldn't be here so late

581
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,439
well they haven't
robbed any people have

582
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,599
they i thought it
was just businesses

583
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,199
well that's true and
i mentioned it to

584
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,038
him but detective
scott said that in

585
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,558
situations like this

586
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,399
you can never be too
careful people get

587
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,158
desperate so we
don't know what might

588
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:54,880
happen

589
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,879

pass that along to

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,399

yeah well honestly
she's not by herself

613
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,439
a lot so half of the
day she has tests

614
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,038
and all that kind
of stuff and then

615
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,959
when jess gets out
of class she goes up

616
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,558
there to be with her
and then when i get

617
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,558
off work we kind
of switch off so

618
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,959
she's honestly not
alone a lot by any

619
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,999
means and

620
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,798
listen she really
just doesn't want you

621
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,558
all to see her like this

622
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,839
so as soon as she
allows visitors

623
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,359

first to know i

624
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,199

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,039
results

657
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,119

look good we found

658
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,359
another brain tumor

659
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,798
another one can we
remove it safely

660
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,319

surgery doesn't have
to be done today

as you know your

664
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,959
insurance won't
cover another surgery

665
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,999
like this

666
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,278

whatever

689
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,278
what's up i'm starting
to think some of

690
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,558
the members of the
church are catching

691
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,999
on to a few things

692
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,639
like what well for
one how many new

693
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,918
members just jump
right in and start

694
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,119
fixing things

695
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,158
these are things
that have been wrong

696
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,759
with this church
for a while now you

697
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,480
don't think it's

698
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:31,918
weird that i'm just
so willing to help

699
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,319
out secondly

700
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,879
i don't think these
people are stupid i

701
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,999
don't know how much
longer we can keep

702
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,640
this up

703
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:40,319
well good the quicker
we can get the

704
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,239
information the
quicker we can arrest

705
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,999
the truth and put them in jail

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,639
right well the last
time i was here

707
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,038
pastor and i were
the last to leave

708
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,479
now he sat in the
same spot where he

709
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,719
always sits only this time

710
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,398
he seemed to be more
protective of that

711
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,319
area if he stood up

712
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,518
he stood up right
here in front of the

713
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,278
podium and if he
moved he moved from

714
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,038
either one side of the other

715
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,599
as if he was trying
to protect something

716
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,798
something he may have forgot

717
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,398
to remove when
before the people got

718
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,398
here so you think
he's hiding here

719
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,439
but it's a bench let's open it

720
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,678
hold on why well
because i don't want to

721
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,640
be wrong

722
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,319
what if we open
that there's nothing

723
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,639
inside or what if he
knows about us and

724
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,719
he's been watching us or

725
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,239
what if he knows
about levi and it's a

726
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,959
setup we don't even
know what he's doing

727
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,999
with the money

728
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,879
who cares he's the
criminal not us wait

729
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,600
wait

730
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:33,999
what has gotten
into you it's like

731
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,398
you've changed dude what

732
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,599
look you're taking
this way too personal

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,239
and held him up at gunpoint when

743
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,720
last night

744
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,079

802
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,838
familiar to all of
us but i want to make

803
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,759
it real in our hearts today

804
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,158
the words of jesus
he says but seek ye

805
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,040
first

806
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:39,279
the kingdom of god
and his righteousness

807
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,638
and all these things will

808
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,198
be added unto you i
love this for a few

809
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,799
different reasons
because number one

810
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,198
he says seek ye first
the kingdom of god

811
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,398
put your eyes

812
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,799
on him just as he
did with peter when

813
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,638
peter steps out of the boat

814
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,799
when peter locks eyes with jesus

815
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,159
everything is okay

816
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,399

remember that for our

817
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,598
heart as well

818
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,759
and then he says all
these things will

819
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,720
be added

820
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:07,919

00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:53,199
But now we just
got another report

918
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,838
saying there's
another one and they

919
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,879
think this one
could be cancerous

920
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,679
yeah you know my wife

921
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,679
and her sister
that's all i've got i

922
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,318
literally have no other family

923
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,800
they're all gone then

924
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,879
we keep hearing this
from the insurance

925
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,318
company that they've
worked with us

926
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,358
as long as they can

927
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,239
and the doctors won't
do anything until

928
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,560
we

929
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:24,639
Get either the
cash shop or a new

930
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,679
insurance which is impossible

931
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,999
so we sit there in
that doctor's office

932
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,439
and as i looked as
we're getting the

933
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,719
news and the doctors
saying there's

934
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,318
literally nothing
they can do they won't

935
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,799
even cover a test

936
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,959
i watched this
tears stream down my

937
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,639
wife's face

938
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,719
and i watched him
stream down jessica's

939
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,799
face

940
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,719
and i sat there and
did the thing that

941
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,838
any

942
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,838
good husband and any
good brother would

943
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,079
do

944
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,040
I took things into my own hands

945
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,839
and i started stealing the money

946
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,639
and i've almost got
enough to not just

947
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,679
cover the test

948
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,399
but to cover the
whole thing well you

949
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,359
know

950
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,719
man jessica she's so hardheaded

951
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,159
sometimes and she

952
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,559
kept asking all these
questions about it

953
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,719
what she could do to
help and what am i

954
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,399
doing to help and i
just couldn't lie to

955
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,159
her

956
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,598
and i told her
and then of course

957
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,919
she wanted to help
and she would always

958
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,358
say

959
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,239
let me do something
to save my sister's

960
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,239
life

961
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,479
but i i just i
couldn't i couldn't do

962
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,359
that because listen

963
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,519
i know the danger
that i'm putting

964
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,639
myself in

965
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,999
every time i have
to do that and i

966
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,960
couldn't even

967
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:56,078
thank to put her
in that situation

968
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,439
she insisted eventually i just

969
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,240
i gave in

970
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,399
we did it we did it together

971
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,399
we'd bring the money
here to the church

972
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,279
hide it right here
until we could safely

973
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,118
get it back to my
house and somehow get

974
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,399
it

975
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,399
Into our savings
account without causing

976
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,799
all these red
flags and alarms we

977
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,239
didn't want to go
through national bank

978
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,838
we went through a
local bank just trying

979
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,879
to

980
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,759
Cover our tracks
because it wasn't about

981
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,480
being

982
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,239
doing the crime
or being criminals

983
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,838
there's nothing about that it

984
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,879
it's about saving my wife's life

985
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,078
for her saving her sister's life

986
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,279
that's what it all comes down to

987
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,519
you know mr levi i really

988
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,078
hope all of this isn't in vain

989
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,838
we've worked so hard for this

990
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,879
we've just prayed
and asked god to show

991
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,319
my wife mercy

992
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,359
and you know for me

993
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,399
i've preached it a
lot god always gets

994
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,239
his man

995
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,358
and i'm hoping i
don't know i'm just

996
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,318
hoping he'll make some unusual

997
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,479
pardon for me and for once

998
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,639
just once he doesn't

999
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,679
because after all to save life

1000
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,960
my wife's life

to just fix your
situation it's wrong oh

1050
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,639
that's easy for you
to say my sister

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,960
she is dying she
needs this money

1052
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,639
just what i do know
is that this is

1053
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,239
wrong

1054
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,439
how do you think
those families gonna

1055
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,199

1056
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,439

here and there

1062
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,279

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,799
about some distant relative

1133
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,679
that you barely knew
and saw every once

1134
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,799
in a while

1135
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,719
i'm talking about
somebody you laughed

1136
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,838
with somebody you cried with

1137
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,959
somebody you spent
your life with

1138
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,879
have you ever lost
a family member like

1139
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,078
that

1140
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,919

that make you feel

1141
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,159
i was upset hurt

1142
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,558
i didn't know what
to do well you know

1143
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,078
what pastor

1144
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,598
that hurt it was
going to bring them

1145
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,839
back

1146
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,598
see i don't expect
you to understand

1147
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,639
everything that
i'm going through

1148
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,558
i'm losing my wife

1149
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,919
and that very pain
that you're talking

1150
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,199
about

1151
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,318
i don't want to
experience because

1152
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,159
marcus there is a fine line

1153
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,279
between misery and pain and that

1154
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,159
includes their lives

1155
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,999
jessica could spend
the rest of her life

1156
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,479
in prison

1157
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,399
do you not care i got
a question for you

1158
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,999
pastor

1159
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,199
when you stand before
god and he asked

1160
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,318
you

1161
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,358
why did you let jessica help you

1162
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,879
steal and rob from people

1163
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,760

straight to the point
i know your rest

1179
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,799
is really important
right now but

1180
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,159
we know that your
husband has been

1181
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,919
stealing money and
using it to pay for

1182
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,519
your surgery coming up

1183
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,358
and the easiest way
for us to just wait

1184
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,679
excuse me now's not
the time to play

1185
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,079
dumb

1186
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,159
we know the entire
story we heard an

1187
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,799
outright confession
from your husband

1188
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,959
excuse me no my
husband would never do

1189
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,118
anything like this

1190
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,959
would be doing your
family a favor if

1191
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,039
you would just tell the truth

1192
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,598
we could end this
investigation and put

1193
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,679
a criminal behind bars

1194
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,199
what about the
families that he's

1195
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,039
robbing to save you

1196
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,639
what about the fear
that he's putting in

1197
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,199
the hearts of
innocent people hey

1198
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,879
my husband wouldn't
do anything like

1199
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,279
this okay he's the
pastor of our church

1200
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,639
he's a dedicated servant to our

1201
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,759
community

1202
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,759
he holds up countless
donations to help

1203
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,279
people in need he would never do

1204
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,039
anything like this

1205
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,959
if he was so dedicated
to doing what's

1206
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,479
right then why
wouldn't he go to the

1207
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,598
church to help his family

1208
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,160
he did

1209
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,279
i was admitted
here two years ago

1210
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,719
for a brain tumor and

1211
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,118
at the time i was
working full time and

1212
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,159
so was my husband

1213
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,159
so we had insurance
to cover the surgery

1214
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,279
then last year my father died

1215
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,919
my husband then took
over as lead pastor

1216
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,078
of our church

1217
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,358
after that i had
to go back to the

1218
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,199
doctor for headaches

1219
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,920
and seizures

1220
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,039
we no longer had the
insurance okay my

1221
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,399
husband was just
working at the church

1222
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,838
and i got laid off

1223
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,679
so the idea came up
to get the church to

1224
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,559
help its donations

1225
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,479
of course i didn't
want him to take it

1226
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,280
to the church

1227
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,879
i was embarrassed
i felt responsible

1228
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,159
but my husband is a
loving and trusting

1229
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,679
man

1230
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,199
and he insisted that
we allow the church

1231
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,760
to help us

1232
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,318
and after a long
conversation i i did i

1233
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,239
let him take it to the church

1234
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,679
and he said that they were doing

1235
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,838
multiple donations

1236
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,039
for this to pay for the surgery

1237
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,280
so you clearly
have the wrong man

1238
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,279
my husband would
never do anything like

1239
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,879
this i don't believe it

1240
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,318
his faith is way
too strong for that

1241
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,078
christina there's
something we need to

1242
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,759
tell you

1243
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,479
the past couple of
months detective levi

1244
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:44,960
has been

1245
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:46,719
undercover at your
husband's church

1246
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,798
disguised as a handyman

1247
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,358
while his main focus
was to infiltrate

1248
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,319
the congregation

1249
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,719
and and figure out
what the pastor was

1250
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,680
up to

1251
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:57,679
we couldn't do
anything unless we had

1252
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,279
hard evidence

1253
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,999
and the other night
detective levi and

1254
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,519
your husband

1255
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,838
they were at the
church alone and he

1256
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,838
told him everything

1257
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,318
i know where the
money's being hidden as

1258
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,680
well as the motive

1259
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,279
christina i know
this is a really hard

1260
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,798
time for you

1261
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,318
but we have to bring
your husband and

1262
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,759
your sister to
justice it's just not

1263
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,519
fair for the many
people whose lives

1264
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,318
have been threatened

1265
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,879
what what we need from you is an

1266
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,479
affidavit

1267
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,558
saying that you were
the recipient of

1268
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,759
the money

1269
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,078
the story that he
told as well as the

1270
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,279
motive behind his decision

1271
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,558
i know this is very
hard but we have to

1272
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:47,440

1273
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:51,920

1328
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,479
what us

1329
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,400
i said i said i've lost my wife

1330
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,798
before i moved here
a couple years ago

1331
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,639
she had cancer
doctors gave her about

1332
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,439
six months to live
i couldn't deal with

1333
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,798
that

1334
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,199
i knew there had to
be some way to make

1335
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,598
her live longer

1336
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,358
i had the same thoughts
you do stealing

1337
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,358
doing whatever i
can to save her life

1338
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,118
but i realized
something me rob and

1339
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,279
stealing doing whatever

1340
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,358
had nothing to do
with saving her life

1341
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,039
but it had everything to do

1342
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,639
with making sure that
someone else hurt

1343
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,440
as much as i hurt

1344
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,879
i covered up that
feeling of saving her

1345
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,119
life

1346
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,999
but i didn't go through
with it you know

1347
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,999
why

1348
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,199
the lord spoke to
me clearly and said

1349
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,519
everyone will bear
their own cross in

1350
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,879
their own appointed time

1351
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,439

then the case is
already underway

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,558
let me first begin
by saying i love my

1486
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,479
husband and my sister

1487
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,118
i always have and
i always will i'm

1488
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,479
writing this letter
because i was

1489
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,479
approached by the detectives

1490
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,639
present and asked to
submit an affidavit

1491
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,318
concerning the receipt
of large sums of

1492
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:45,119
money

1493
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,439
for my surgery for
my husband and my

1494
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,319
sister

1495
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,679
justin thomas and
jessica williams

1496
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,118
and i was under the
impression that it

1497
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,719
was donations from
the church that he

1498
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,479
had collected

1499
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,159
while under this
assumption i freely

1500
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,999
accepted the money
and asked my husband

1501
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,078
to thank the church
every time he came

1502
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,919
with another donation

1503
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,679
i know that my family
was wrong but they

1504
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,759
were trying to save a life

1505
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,558
my life haven't we
all done things to

1506
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,199
save one that caused
the pain of another

1507
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,959
even if it was
telling a small lie it

1508
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,639
still hurt somebody

1509
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,239
but just like this
case that doesn't

1510
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,479

1544
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,959
ma'am i regret to
inform you that

1545
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,400
your sister has passed away

1546
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,678

god no among other things

1548
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,119
god is a god of
order and justice

1549
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,959
we can't go through
life trying to save

1550
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,959
the ones we love by
hurting people we

1551
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,157
don't know

1552
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,718
god always has a way
of getting his man

1553
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
or woman

1554
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,999
one thing that i
learned is that we have

1555
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,318
to be willing to
submit our lives to his

1556
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,040
will

1557
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,959
regardless of the
outcome we would

1558
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,318
prefer

1559
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,838
always remember
that we have to be

1560
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,079
willing to trust
god no matter what

1561
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,119
we think we have to
know that what he

1562
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,519
deems as being the best outcome

1563
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,559
is the right outcome
i had to learn that

1564
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,959
although my wife
was important to me

1565
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,999
everybody is
important to somebody

1566
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,398
even as christians
we have to suffer the

1567
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,438
consequences of

1568
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,559
our actions our
punishment from god is

1569
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,879
always far worse
than anything man can

1570
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,999
decide

1571
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,999
we can't let revenge
take over our minds

1572
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,879
always remember that
when you go to take

1573
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,639
from someone else
because of what was

1574
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,919
taken from you

1575
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,238
you only take yourself
away from those

1576
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,678
who love you

1577
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,759
i hope that my testimony
has touched you

1578
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,039
in some way

1579
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,239
