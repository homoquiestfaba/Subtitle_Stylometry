00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:12,587
The hardest part of
the lockdown for me was...

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,856
just being...

4
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,859
you know, before the lockdown,
everything was free,

5
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:19,928
like I could leave my house,
I could do whatever I wanted.

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,930
I was looking forward
to everything

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,299
we were gonna do
with the band.

8
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:24,532
Like, I was in the middle of

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:28,570
a show for
my high school musical.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,607
Just one month ago,

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,976
I was out in San Diego
with my friends

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,643
and we were having
a really good time.

13
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:36,911
And then one month later,

14
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:38,414
everything's
locked down and then

15
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,615
the whole world's going crazy

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,751
and I don't know what to do.

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,754

are literally my life.

18
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:48,656

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,693
I felt very, very alone.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,931
I definitely felt very lonely.

21
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:58,733
I definitely felt lonely.

22
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,835
It kind of felt like...

23
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,274
the world was telling you that
you couldn't live your life.

00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:06,841

What's wrong?

355
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,587
You're just like your father.

356
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,589
You ball everything up inside.

357
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:35,723

Nothing, I told you.

361
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,203
Of course you are.

You're a young man,

363

the sharmutas.

00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:54,977
Sharmutas, I...

365
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,346
don't think she's a sharmuta.

366
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,115
Whatever that is.

367
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:02,351
Is she pretty?

00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:05,820
Yeah, she's pretty.

369
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:08,357
She can skate too,
better than Gary.

About being my girlfriend.

Nothing.

Tell me.

He proposed to Amy, and she's
officially accepting today.

- You asked her out?
- Yeah.

405
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:06,508
Oh no, no, no.
He didn't just ask her out.

406
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:10,446
He went up on her front porch

Why are you guys
looking at me like that?

They might need to close for
a while to keep you guys safe.

to your parents later today.

Oh, thanks.

456
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,841
The last time
I saw you was where?

457
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,877
At the expo, right?
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,645
Thank you so much
for being here.

459
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:57,813
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah,

460
00:23:57,945 --> 00:24:00,249
so I have really good news.

461
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,151
Your test came back negative.

462
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,519
- Yeah.
- Oh!

463
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,087
So, you're hired.
You can start tomorrow.

464
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,191
- Oh, wow.
- Our first class is at 9 am.

465
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,026
I know you must be
a little bit nervous

466
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,694
because you've never worked
with kids before,

467
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,062
and I totally understand.

468
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,631
But you're an amazing musician

469
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:17,699
and I want you to be really
confident in this role.

470
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,067
Like...

471
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:20,402
What's wrong?

472
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:22,771
You're just sitting
on my notebook.

473
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:25,207
Oh, oh, sorry.

474
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,708
No, no, it's okay.

475
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:29,745
So here is the schedule
for the rest of the year.

476
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,079
To enter the building,

477
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:32,614
you'll have
to get tested each week

478
00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:34,683
and we can work around
those dates you mentioned.

479
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:37,152
Yeah, I'm gonna go see my mom.

480
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:38,921
Yeah, that's not a problem.

481
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:40,289
The most important thing
is they have

482
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:42,257
a really important
showcase coming up.

483
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:44,893
A major agency is coming
and it should be a big deal,

484
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:47,729
but I'm having a hard time
getting them excited about it.

485
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:48,963
Yeah.

486
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:50,599
Shame.

487
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:53,168
It must be really hard
for musicians right now, right?

488
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:56,038
Yeah, that's kind
of why I'm here.

489
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:58,006
And thank you so much
for being here.

490
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,341
The kids are going through
the same thing.

491

492

literally in lockdown
for months now.

493
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,047
- Mm.
- Yeah.

494
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,015
I'm seeing a bunch
of contact info here.

495
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:08,884
Everything's on Zoom?

496
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,520
Yes, it means everything
is on Zoom.

497
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:13,689
Did you not know that?

498
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,157
No, I didn't.

499
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,626
- That'll be interesting.
- Yeah?

500
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,029
Uh, what about
these instruments?

501
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:22,164
Do they play them still?

502
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,833
Oh no, not anymore, obviously.

503
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,202
You're welcome
to use them, but...

504
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:28,937
- they won't be here.
- Okay.

505
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:32,307
Yeah, so grab the sheet and
let's get your paperwork ready.

506
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:34,643
All right. Let's do this.

507
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:37,679
So the ninth,
that's when I start?

508
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:39,248
No, tomorrow.

you guys and reach out to you
