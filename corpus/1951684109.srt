00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:58,086
BellotoN for Gore Nation

3
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,718
- How is everything?
- Well.

4
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,685
It is calmed. I am glad of which
the airplane is not full.

5
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:05,963
You astonish to me.
And the meteorological conditionses?

6
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,279
That me d? more problems.

7
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:09,323
Llegamos in time?

8
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:13,606
No, we go delayed to Paris.

9
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:16,443
It tell me that

10
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:20,077
- you will sleep a little.
- I will lie down soon, you I promise it.

11
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,877
They see with us,
it will be amused.

12
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:24,957
Paris at night,

13
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:26,925
the Elyseos Fields, the discs,

14
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,362
- men…
- I have things that to do.

15
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:33,317
I must leave you,
I have work.

16
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,286
You are not the unique one.

17
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:51,684
What is this boosting charge?

18
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,045
A shipment of last minute

19
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,959
for the government.

20
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,802
There will be a armed watchman
in the compartment.

21
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,605
He is high-priority.

22
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:04,043
What is what takes?

23
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:06,604
I prefer not to know it.

24
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,960
Apparently, everything is in rule,
we are going to be able to loosen to the explorer.

25
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:17,997
There are orders of which if there is
some anomaly

26
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,680
that it concerns the shipment…

27
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:22,241
An anomaly?

28
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:23,806
We must warn

29
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:27,562
to doctor Bennett
and to doctor Sebastian.

30
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,158
They are those that loaded it.

31
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:31,726
They are in first.

32
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:32,717
An anomaly?

33
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:36,001
I am happy that it is
my last flight.

34
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:07,125
- Lucas, c?lmate.
- You do not listen to me!

35
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,357
I refuse to lose Kelly.

36
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:10,198
Comprendes?

37
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:14,121
C?lmate. We had said that
no scandal.

38
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,597
We will remove it from the coma
in means with calm atmosphere.

39
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,201
By all means
he is not very orthodox,

40
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,439
but it is necessary to do it quickly,
it is the only exit.

41
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:24,357
Is not orthodox?

42
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,996
Dying Esaba
and we saved it.

43
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:31,436
Without us, there would be dead,
you already know it.

44
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,043
Conseguimos to convince
to our friend?

45
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:38,597
Kolinsky organized everything,
we will meet in the Prague.

46
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:39,483
In the Prague?

47
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:42,036
The laboratory is not in Toulon?

48
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,323
Hackers will go there
directly.

49
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:45,556
We do not have time!

50
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:49,117
We knew the risks.
But it thinks about the good that becomes.

51
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:53,966
We give back beings to the life.
It is the reason of our sacrifice.

52
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,357
It was conscious of the risks.

53
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,320
It is easy to say it, is not
your woman who is within that!

54
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:00,556
Yes?

55
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,479
Siéntate.

56
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,199
I know what you feel.

57
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,561
I include/understand to you.

58
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,363
I am perfectly conscious
of which it is in game.

59
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:15,366
The luck of my society
it depends on this project

60
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:18,439
and I can be killed
in order to save to thousands.

61
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:21,167
I will not leave anybody,
neither to you nor to your woman,

62
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,716
nothing that puts it in danger.

63
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,798
Ciérrala
and it returns to sentarte.

64
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:28,083
The subject is closed.

65
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,124
We agree?

66
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:32,522
Understood.

67
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,246
Disc?lpame.

68
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,245
One is not going away to loosen.

69
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:41,886
You do not worry yourself,

70
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:46,276
it will not leave Paris,
not with us in any case.

71
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,164
Young lady?
A rum-soda water.

72
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,919
I feel, I forgot it my modales.
Two.

73
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:06,362
Totally in agreement.

74
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,356
A very short soda water?

75
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:11,920
With a little rum,

76
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,806
this will remain between us,
in agreement?

77
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,486
And you, gentleman…

78
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,685
Burrows, Truman.
No, thanks.

79
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:26,637
I, am Frank.

80
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:28,726
Frank Lee Strathmore.

81
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,481
It is a rich name in history,
my family…

82
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,320
The history of your family
it does not interest to him.

83
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:36,404
Listening…

84
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:41,081
They stopped me by a history
false of infractions.

85
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:44,717
We will see ourselves under the Eiffel tower,
to midnight…

86
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,400
I feel decepcionarte,

87
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,962
but our friend
very he will be occupied.

88
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,282
Nothing burdens.

89
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,519
I am to your disposition.

90
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,363
Thanks.

91
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:05,202
Let us say that it is not
my day of luck.

92
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,040
If you act well,

93
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,482
it is to you to whom it goes
to miss.

94
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,758
It closes the mouth and it drinks your soda water.

95
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,158
Hello.

96
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,724
Truely charming.

97
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,359
- You would put a little to Me sugar?
- Calmémonos.

98
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,560
Ally made its suitcases?

99
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,323
For five years.

100
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,759
The famous retirement
of Ray Bashore.

101
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,724
Is not your last flight?

102
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,641
She preferred to remain
in order to prepare the trip.

103
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,160
Where v?is?

104
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,363
Vacations with the grandsons,

105
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:01,315
and soon, cruise in Alaska,
single she and I.

106
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:04,479
- What romantic!
- The cruise, yes,

107
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,160
but the chiquillos…

108
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,204
that nightmare.

109
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:09,766
This seems to me fantastic.

110
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:10,723
Thanks.

111
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,595
He is not terrible there ahead.

112
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,639
Nothing disquieting.

113
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:21,958
What interminable flight…

114
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,239
I am impatient
to make purchases in Paris.

115
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,237
Courtney advised to me

116
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:32,041
to go to see jewels,
and soon…

117
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,517
I am impatient
to go to practice surf to Biarritz.

118
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,440
- Practicar surf?
- Yes, you included/understood well.

119
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:41,043
- Speech for you.
- As you want.

120
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,721
With the vixen of Jackie.

121
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:46,447
Tony is my colleague, in agreement?

122
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,565
We have come for this.

123
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:50,206
And its friend

124
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:52,398
he is true puta.

125
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,603
What happens to you?

126
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,959
I do not like, that is everything.

127
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,480
If you say it.

128
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:03,643
Tony!

129
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,443
A masterful play, friend.

130
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,277
He is not bad.

131
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,403
You are making me damage.

132
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:16,163
You are listillo.

133
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,445
Good launching.

134
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:23,479
You I give back it as soon as
let play.

135
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:25,286
It cannot confiscate it.

136
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,756
Apparently, yes.
Good launching.

137
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:49,842
Mr. Freeman?

138
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,717
- Can give an autograph me?
- By all means.

139
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:56,277
Its last putt
in the end of the Masters…

140
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:57,960
Fué pure poetry.

141
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,196
Really?

142
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,120
- Here it is.
- Thanks, Mr. Freeman.

143
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,802
One cannot have peace?

144
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:12,125
I thought that she could
to forget golf.

145
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,084
He had the intention.

146
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,685
I swear to you
that during the rest of the trip,

147
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:21,156
I will be simply Billy.

148
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,275
You are going to forget to the king drive.

149
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,280
I adore this smile.

150
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,119
Disc?lpeme, Mr. Freeman.

151
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,721
Bashore commander
he wanted to salute to him.

152
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:36,277
Can happen to see him
at the moment of its rest?

153
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,720
No problem.

154
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,560
If it already finished
to speak with my husband,

155
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,164
I want another one bloody Mary.

156
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,006
I am of vacations.

157
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,395
I am engaged in it.

158
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,602
This time does not forget the vodka,

159
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,525
is as well as I animate myself!

160
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,443
He would be bad-mannered not to take care of to him.

161
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,404
The bottom must have left some type

162
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:05,915
that it does not have your autograph.

163
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,840
Perhaps it would have
to go to solve that.

164
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,080
You knew the situation
marrying with me.

165
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,125
It is what I believed.

166
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,805
You are right that I must
to polish your to putter.

167
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,238
He is everything what you are going to polish.

168
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,918
You did not say that last night.

169
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,443
You know that it is an error.

170
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,927
For that reason Interpol
it put your photo throughout.

171
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,601
Common error of identification.

172
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:49,800
I do not deserve this.

173
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,726
I am innocent.

174
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:56,200
It is unjust to persecute to me
around the world

175
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,642
by a crime
that I did not commit.

176
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:00,516
I am innocent.

177
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:05,078
I am innocent,
I become aware calm.

178
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:10,275
What I must do

179
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,836
for probarte my innocence?

180
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:16,240
A miracle.

181
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:21,279
C?llate or I cover the mouth to you with
your oxygen mask.

182
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,326
One already went away.

183
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:38,843
We can avoid it,
not to fly over it.

184
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,122
It is a great disturbance.

185
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:43,723
One extends to 150 miles
to the west,

186
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,276
wherever we go,
we have it beaten.

187
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:50,359
If no, we always can
to give returned average,

188
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:52,677
but we lose 30 minutes at least.

189
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,323
Meteorology in Paris is bad.

190
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,847
I am going to turn aside itself to the left
and to avoid it.

191
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:04,046
It is the only solution
if it is wanted to avoid.

192
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:16,765
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:20,522
we crossed a zone
of turbulences. Quedénse seated

194
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,280
and abrochénse its belts.

195
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,597
15 minutes will last about.

196
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:25,836
Thanks.

197
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:31,076
O?ste?

198
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,723
This must be one
fall of some luggage.

199
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:39,596
Error of the system

200
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,678
An intervention equipment

201
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,000
from the company and the FBI they took
the MEDCON premises.

202
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:58,842
Some haltings

203
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,157
they have been carried out
but we ignored

204
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:03,796
where they are
the 4 main suspects.

205
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:07,198
First he is the Dr Leo Bennett,
head of investigators

206
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,836
and MEDCON founder,
famous by its works

207
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:13,238
on rétrovirus
and synthetic Biology.

208
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,684
Investigated Fué
by illegal clonaci?n,

209
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:20,118
but it was not possible to be demonstrated
no accusation.

210
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:23,006
It is not sufficient
in order to bother the President.

211
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,680
Aténgase to the facts.

212
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:27,682
Let us try to recover
its hard disk

213
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,803
and we must be alert.

214
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,762
Let us think that she is the author

215
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:37,237
of a new stock
of the virus of the malaria.

216
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:41,082
As well as of its preparation
and of its transport.

217
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:44,519
- The malaria?
- He is that about which one thought about the principle.

218
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:47,406
But we discovered
that one is another thing.

219
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,125
Still completely not known.

220
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,722
It had DNA of a mosquito

221
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,764
original of the fine bottom of Vietnam

222
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:57,203
that it has a mortality index
of the 100% in a second.

223
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:01,565
He is able to regenerate
during a second,

224
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,445
or more, according to the sample.

225
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:07,123
Bennett developed a mutation
of he himself virus

226
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:09,562
that he allows to regenerate the organs

227
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,321
- indefinitely.
- That is to say, that this virus

228
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,399
kills organs and it revives them?

229
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,957
- Not only that.
- It was experimenting

230
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:22,244
the resurrection
of the whole body.

231
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:25,285
That cannot be certain, we go!

232
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,405
According to our investigation,
it was successful.

233
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:13,956
Hay somebody?

234
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,120
What is what happens?

235
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,917
What is what it happens to me?

236
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:48,157
It cannot be. What fails?

237
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,045
It alerts

238
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,197
Problem of communication
and of electricity.

239
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,047
Fall of temperature
in the compartment.

240
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,276
Concord 239 to the tower.

241
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,161
Concord 239 to the tower!

242
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:09,319
Brilliant, problems in the radio
in this foll?n!

243
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:10,203
Perfect!

244
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,517
But this goes or no?

245
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:14,564
I am ill.

246
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:17,036
Necesito helps!

247
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:28,077
I am investigator
of laboratories MEDCON.

248
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:33,003
Where is doctor Bennett?

249
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,276
I must speak to somebody!

250
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,325
I am going to leave.
Does not shoot!

251
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,165
Leave and nonfiring.

252
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,156
Where is?

253
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:37,799
I go to the toilets.

254
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,877
You bring a tail to Me light?

255
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,438
- Yes, wanted.
- Thanks, baby.

256
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,997
Pump goes.

257
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,715
It is a bomb?ncito, the vixen.

258
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:08,322
Joder, this makes damage!

259
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:09,920
Hello, wanted.

260
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,524
I imagine that it was broken
the pipe of the toilets.

261
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:17,158
Yes, my love.

262
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,082
What?

263
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,076
They see here.

264
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,283
What?

265
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,076
Some problem?

266
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:47,439
And if somebody sees us?

267
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,836
We are in the toilets,
of what you are scared?

268
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:52,998
It is not what meant.

269
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,759
You are the best friend of Peter.

270
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:57,962
And what?

271
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,723
Pardon, did not want asustarte.

272
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,920
He is not nothing, was distracted.
Return to his site

273
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,362
and its belt abr?chese.

274
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,677
- Another coffee?
- Yes, thanks.

275
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:35,603
The request.

276
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,803
Megan, this rima with vegan.
I practiced,

277
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:38,877
during 2 days.

278
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,641
- Megan vegan!
- Only Megan.

279
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,844
Yes, I have included/understood.

280
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,207
- It is going to seat again.
-, Yes clear…

281
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,006
but more letter is a little.

282
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,680
There is rare people.

283
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,885
We do not know who can raise
to a flight.

284
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,480
Return to its seat.

285
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:59,077
Thanks. I close it.

286
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,083
Is not truth!

287
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:36,237
Too much amused, no?

288
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:04,765
This diversion will make forget me
your old fashioned suit.

289
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:08,846
What you prefer
an orange pajamas?

290
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:10,964
Like which you are going to take?

291
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,799
You do not serve to be bad,

292
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,401
whereas what I do
an advice is ofrecerte

293
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,444
on the change of suit.

294
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,678
Nevertheless,
I like much your shirt.

295
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,724
Does It for man?

296
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:28,763
For your information, the pajamas
in France they are bordeaux.

297
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:31,199
That would go to you perfect.

298
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:34,365
I will offer the underpants to you
that they combine.

299
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,677
One would say that you are jealous.

300
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,359
I am going to lower a little.

301
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:14,606
Crees that this is finished?

302
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:18,406
We are going to see.

303
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:22,723
Here Randy.

304
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:26,841
Stacy to the speech.
There are wounded passengers.

305
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:28,196
Seriously?

306
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,246
I do not know, this is a chaos.

307
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:34,365
We do the best thing than we can.
We will have to him to the current.

308
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,803
We have one calms momentary.

309
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,481
That they are going to verify,
I want to know.

310
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,920
Our excuses by
these strong turbulences.

311
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,362
The situation seems to improve

312
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:58,599
but we crossed
an unstable zone,

313
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,837
I request to them that they remain seated

314
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,157
so far.

315
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:05,159
Only the attack personnel

316
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:07,762
he is authorized to circulate.
Thanks.

317
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:12,122
You can verify if
they are the passengers affluent?

318
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:15,085
P?delo to one of the doctors,
Bennett or Sebastian

319
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:18,000
that they check the state
of the shipment with you.

320
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,835
The shipment?

321
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,680
I will take my material.

322
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:31,202
Nothing burdens?

323
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,482
It is its head.

324
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:49,919
How goes? Hurts something to You?

325
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,918
Puto headache.

326
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,486
They are the turbulences.

327
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:56,116
- I am scared.
- That blandengue.

328
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:56,878
This will be fixed.

329
00:27:58,687 --> 00:27:59,756
Tienes some problem?

330
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,636
Tienes fear that crashes?

331
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,525
If agarrro you will see you, to joder

332
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:07,121
Pon to average light and
estate calm.

334
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:12,246

- Really, you are one puta cow.

335
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:15,157

337
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:19,923

This bond also for you.

To your sites.

342
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,040
What you think?

343
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:39,403
We had several alert
inhabituales.

344
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,604
He is not probably nothing,
but better it will be to verify.

345
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,196
I agree.
Acomp??alo.

346
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,682

00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:49,003
Well.

348
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,761
Those that go, that me
find when coming out.

349
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:55,602
This hill a little
to lower, and it is not easy.

350
00:28:58,927 --> 00:28:59,996
Eh excrement.

351
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,442
- You it had said it.
- Barren!

352
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,643
It sees see the passengers.

353
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:09,557
If there has been some error,
Kelly will have died.

354
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,878
Vig?lalo, that no

00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:20,802

The airplane is empty.

00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:28,281
You are of joke, everything goes well.
Thanks.

359
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:32,002

00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,405
I take care of that.

363
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:48,120
Not without danger.

364
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:51,038
Yes, if fear is had of
the dark.

365
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:53,802
It sees, Burrows.

366
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:56,885
I need to go to the urinal.

367
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:57,638
What?

368
00:29:57,807 --> 00:29:59,763
- I have desire to piss.
- No

369
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:02,487
You have already heard it,
quédate seated and holds.

370
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,006
Very well.

371
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,157
If you feel something lukewarm,

372
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:12,485
you move a little to the right.

373
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,000
True chiquillo.

374
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:19,040
Come, we go there.

375
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,640
For ahead.

376
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,081
By all means.

377
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:25,682
Mr. Burrows?

378
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:27,041
Truman?

379
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:28,556
Is not truth!

380
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:35,122
Gentlemen, went away.

381
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:22,085
What way to touch cojones.

382
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:32,637
The flight deck.

383
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:35,117
Here Megan, takes 4 Ls.

384
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,686
We have a problem.

385
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:38,519
Is serious?

386
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:42,601
Poli that the prisoner escorted
he has been attacked,

387
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,118
and the type disappeared.

388
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,083
Disc?lpame,

389
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,203
you will not have seen
a type flacucho

390
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,323
with the returned neck blue?

391
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:07,078
No

392
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:00,481
This of explains here
the failure of the radio.

393
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:01,837
Brian?

394
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,123
Thorp Doctor? Kevin?

395
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:12,360
He is not in the seat
of monitoring.

396
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,803
- It is impossible.
- Busquemos!

397
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,476
Hay to close the feeder!

398
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:26,196
Lucas.

399
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:31,084
Kelly… God mine…

400
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:13,525
Never you do that!

401
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:16,878
- What you murmur?
- Nothing!

402
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,561
And you are not crude with me.

403
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,201
Ey, the tortolitos.

404
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,681
One assumes that you must
to be in your sites.

405
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:21,040
Hazme a sandwich,
while you are there.

406
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:33,755
What you did?

407
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:35,155
Cabronazo!

408
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,439
What you transport?

409
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,321
Go to its sites.

410
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:50,440
- It is going to seat.
- What is what happens?

411
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:52,637
Ray, opens!

412
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,601
- What happens?
- It is necessary to land.

413
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:59,636
Aterriza or we are going all to palmar!

414
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,964
What is what happened down?

415
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:14,040
Those putos doctors
they released something!

416
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:15,959
What? Where is the doctors?

417
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:17,435
Murieron!

418
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:18,676
Siéntate!

419
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:21,361
Esc?chame!
Vamos all to also die!

420
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:23,802
Siéntate and calmate!

421
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,241
I am seated!

422
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:30,239
What happened to you?

423
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:34,400
Esc?chame kindly,
Ray.

424
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:38,365
If you do not land more soon,

425
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,401
you, I, Emily,

426
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:44,081
everybody is going to die.

427
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:47,680
I cannot do this
without authorization,

428
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:48,996
reacts!

429
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,126
There is something there…

430
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:54,844
a cruel creature

431
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,760
that she is going to kill to us
if we do not do something,

432
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,645
so she acts
as you want…

433
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:02,316
- Calm…
- A place Finds,

434
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:05,286
and airplane lands this puto,
although is on a way!

435
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,156
The radio does not go and we have
this storm.

436
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:10,443
I am going to give returned average.

437
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:14,964
There is an agent of the TSA attack.
Encuéntralo and that appears here.

438
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:16,037
Immediately!

439
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,119
You are sure that it is it?

440
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:54,360
Then, they died,

441
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,437
and what he killed them
was not human?

442
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:00,400
I know that is foolish,

443
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,962
but I saw with my eyes.

444
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:04,765
I saw monsters

445
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,725
to do paté with its meat
and to eat them!

446
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:10,357
It seems that there is a fugitive attack.

447
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:12,199
Perhaps he was he.

448
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:17,042
You I said it,
there were two…

449
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,638
and they were not human.

450
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,558
I want to know
what there was there inside.

451
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:24,955
Where you go?

452
00:40:25,127 --> 00:40:27,243
To make speak to that cowardly one
of Bennett.

453
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:28,726
Siéntate.

454
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,360
I am going to go to see.

455
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,960
I have you to the current.

456
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:45,166
Tenemos something?

457
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,316
How goes the head?

458
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,205
Better than the ego.

459
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:54,556
As soon as this calms,
I again begin to look for it.

460
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:56,564
You do not go there only.

461
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,004
So that, he is dangerous?

462
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:00,595
He is not an assassin,

463
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,077
he is rather a swindler.

464
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:05,078
What did?

465
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:07,595
He was made happen
by an accountant,

466
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:09,764
he robbed the Russian Mafia,

467
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:12,077
he took hold his jet plane
and he starred it.

468
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:15,080
Everybody wants it.

469
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,158
So that you take it to Paris?

470
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:24,556
How goes?

471
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,199
You would have sentarte again.

472
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:30,085
I know prudent.

473
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,681
Control tower of Yellowknife
Canada

474
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:35,843
Mira this!

475
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:38,521
I believe that I located to
Concord 239.

476
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:45,718
He was missing
for one hour.

477
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,878
Los Angeles? Here Yellowknife.

478
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,005
I believe that I have its Concord
in my screen.

479
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,604
It is between two fronts

480
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,565
and the transponder indicates
that it changed of course.

481
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,917
No contact of radio.
The attempt.

482
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:03,036
Concord 239,
here the tower of Yellowknife.

483
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:08,396
Tower of Yellowknife
to Concord 239.

484
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,281
CCT of Los Angeles.

485
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:14,246
Well, I include/understand.

486
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:22,765
Give instructions to 239
to return to American space.

487
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:25,566
It will not have the authorization
to land

488
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,718
nor to fly over ours
airspace,

489
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:30,526
by decision of the discharges
Canadian instances

490
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:33,884
in agreement with the ministry of
Foreign subjects and the Health.

491
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:38,924
Can say to me what
it transports in the warehouse?

492
00:42:39,087 --> 00:42:39,758
I feel it,

493
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:43,556
my shipment is classified
like secret by Defense,

494
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,206
it does not have access there.

495
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:47,802
I belong
to the aerial security,

496
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,320
I must be put to as much.

497
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:54,037
What possibility has to have
a man like you on board.

498
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,237
The atmosphere of the airplane puts to me
a little nervous,

499
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:00,635
everything goes well?

500
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:02,400
It horrifies the airplane to me.

501
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:04,760
Its two colleagues

502
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:07,361
they accompanied the copilot
to the warehouse

503
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:09,040
was some problem?

504
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:10,162
No, none.

505
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:11,316
Really?

506
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,762
- A simple routine control.
- That is.

507
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:19,442
However, if this shipment
he is not dangerous,

508
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:22,075
he is very fragile and most expensive.

509
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:25,319
He is why nobody
it can approach him.

510
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:27,921
- D?game…
- I feel It,

511
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,522
I already said too much.

512
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:01,556
Paul Judd, TSA,
his prisoner is in the warehouse.

513
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:07,643
Prepared?

514
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:36,999
- Muéstrate!
- Dra. Thorp!

515
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:40,405
Dr Sebastian!

516
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:48,755
Hay somebody?

517
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:51,281
That blood pool.

518
00:44:51,447 --> 00:44:55,042
- Somebody had a problem.
- If he is Frank, it needs aid.

519
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:10,962
Acércame that.

520
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:14,398
It had to slip by the conduits.

521
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:16,640
I do not know anything on that.

522
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:19,885
It is much blood
for mequetrefe like him.

523
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:23,404
You see this way, I I go over there.

524
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,159
We did not find in 5 minutes.

525
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,795
There I will be, friend

526
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,356
Veto, that discusses a little.

527
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,004
Everything goes well, you do not worry.

528
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,118
You and I are going to speak, single.

529
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:16,203
I am going to solve this excrement.

530
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:19,797
You will have wanted it.

531
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:22,995
I raise.

532
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,203
You are safe of that?

533
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,315
Fantastic.

534
00:46:40,687 --> 00:46:42,245
Thanks, lieutenant.

535
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,083
They located to Bennett
and its equipment.

536
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:47,077
Aleluya.

537
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:17,559
You know, sometimes this work
he is singsong truely,

538
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:19,957
but now it is not the case.

539
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:23,202
We can say that
you put it sharp.

540
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:40,443
- In the name of God!
- Voy to vomit!

541
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:42,556
What is this house of crazy people?

542
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:44,285
What is what happens, to joder?

543
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,165
Fell to me above!

544
00:48:46,447 --> 00:48:48,517
Hay firings by all
the senses!

545
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,927
Please, it siéntese.
Everything goes well.

546
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:00,236
Go to its sites.

547
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,840
Everything goes well.

548
00:49:11,087 --> 00:49:12,839
It is the total chaos here.

549
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:16,556
There were firings,
the passengers are terrified.

550
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:30,158
Ve there! Agarra a weapon!

551
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,599
Is not possible!

552
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:28,036
It backs down.

553
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,277
Vuelva to seat!

554
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:32,837
Venga!

555
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:04,236
Loose!

556
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:08,637
Deja happen!

557
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,486
Beloved, ?breme!

558
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:13,921
Loose!

559
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:25,396
Joder!

560
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:28,319
Salt of there!

561
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,079
Larguémonos.

562
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:35,442
Quédate there! You do not move!

563
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:37,325
Joder, what is that excrement?

564
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:40,476
Excrement of airplane!

565
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:20,045
What happens, to joder?

566
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:42,321
What is what happened?

567
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,560
Be going to seat.

568
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:04,042
Cabin of pilotage.

569
00:53:04,207 --> 00:53:05,686
We have problems.

570
00:53:07,647 --> 00:53:09,842
A passenger has been attacked

571
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:11,201
and he died.

572
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:13,005
It is necessary that somebody takes care.

573
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:16,478
- Megan…
- You do not include/understand,

574
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:19,002
there is blood throughout,
Stacy,

575
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:20,885
and there are wounded passengers.

576
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:22,765
Who attacked them?

577
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:28,520
Probably the fled prisoner,
if no, I do not know.

578
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:32,117
We are going to land
as soon as it is possible.

579
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,926
But it is necessary to happen
by the center of the disturbance.

580
00:53:36,687 --> 00:53:39,281
The passengers must
to seat in its sites.

581
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,405
Tengo as much fear!

582
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:08,003
Excrement! Socorro!

583
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:10,799
Socorro, ay?deme!

584
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,082
Van to kill to us!

585
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:16,636
It is necessary that
be going to see the passengers.

586
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:30,801
?breme! Socorro!

587
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:33,117
All are going to die!

588
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:37,122
Ay?dame, to joder!

589
00:56:24,607 --> 00:56:26,279
What is what happens?

590
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:29,962
You I cannot explain,
is necessary to release itself!

591
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,717
Van to kill to us!

592
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:35,196
C?lmate and cuéntame!

593
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:37,716
What is what happens?

594
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:41,038
Sit?ate here,
you must shoot from here!

595
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:43,596
Vamos all to palmar!

596
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:10,965
Bill, where you go?

597
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:49,877
This way!

598
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,644
- Where?
- Behind, the ground is fine,

599
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:54,240
we will be outside danger.

600
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:55,602
My woman is above!

601
00:57:58,887 --> 00:58:01,560
You see look for it
and returns immediately!

602
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:40,002
You! Ay?dame to open this!

603
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:42,965
I found something better.

604
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,839
Trepa there!

605
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:51,362
D?nos that you see.

606
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:54,960
Then?

607
00:58:55,607 --> 00:58:58,167
- Ves!
- Echame a hand.

608
00:59:15,487 --> 00:59:16,442
To earth!

609
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,120
How goes? No mordedura?

610
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:37,482
We believed…

611
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:40,483
What ate the passengers?

612
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:41,762
I am vegetarian.

613
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,804
Most of the scientists it thinks

614
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:05,562
that one is a virus
transmissible by serum.

615
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,686
For which it does not have
neither bovine nor remedy.

616
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:13,157
This it is transmitted
by the corporal fluids,

617
01:00:13,407 --> 01:00:17,082
for example a cut
that it is in contact with the enemy with the blood

618
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:18,282
or the saliva.

619
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:20,438
MEDCON believed in that
of sharp way,

620
01:00:25,927 --> 01:00:29,636
In order to paraphrase the report
of doctor Bennett,

621
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:32,362
this virus would have served
of biological weapon.

622
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:35,885
In order to allow the soldiers
to fight after its death,

623
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:39,164
in order to send to a enemy prisoner
contaminated by the virus

624
01:00:39,407 --> 01:00:42,160
in order that the troops
they finish killing itself.

625
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:47,406
I am going to recommend,
as well as to the President,

626
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:52,766
to demolish flight 239 before
that she reaches a populated zone.

627
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:54,882
Hope.

628
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:59,245
Va to order that she lowers herself
a civil apparatus?

629
01:00:59,847 --> 01:01:01,838
We do not have any contact.

630
01:01:02,327 --> 01:01:04,636
We must be conceited
that the container yielded

631
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:07,002
and that the virus
it contaminated the passengers.

632
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:10,245
The only thing that there is to do
in order to solve it,

633
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:13,365
it is to exterminate a
the occupants of that airplane,

634
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:15,996
before the virus
it reaches a populated zone.

635
01:01:18,727 --> 01:01:20,240
Agrees?

636
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:21,726
That me d? fear.

637
01:01:30,007 --> 01:01:31,679
P?seme to the President.

638
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:41,842
God mine…

639
01:01:48,847 --> 01:01:50,280
Suéltala!

640
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:44,324
So that?

641
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:47,406
So that you did that?
I am speaking to You!

642
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:48,283
I am not.

643
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:51,283
I only obeyed orders.

644
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,398
This had to prolong the life,

645
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:56,206
I did not imagine
these atrocious results!

646
01:02:56,567 --> 01:02:59,365
Bravo, idiot, his results
they ate the passengers.

647
01:02:59,607 --> 01:03:01,643
I do not have to render to him
no account.

648
01:03:02,607 --> 01:03:05,075
Your DAS the orders,
you speak to poli,

649
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:07,522
you are who have them
there down!

650
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:09,564
You did not include/understand anything,
I am not!

651
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:11,240
Habla less!

652
01:03:11,647 --> 01:03:14,639
And he continues, you are going them to look for
with us.

653
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:33,680
The step is each
closer time.

654
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:35,926
We are near the aim.

655
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:56,597
I am wounded!

656
01:04:56,847 --> 01:04:58,838
?breme!

657
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:03,523
Quickly!

658
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:46,600
- This never is going to walk.
- It will be necessary.

659
01:05:56,247 --> 01:05:57,919
We go by the other flank.

660
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:08,402
The chest, cojones,
and bingo.

661
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:11,560
They have raised barricades.

662
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:14,965
Frank, I see you!

663
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:17,522
Entendiste?
Cabronazo.

664
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:24,317
Come.

665
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:37,836
Ven, Frank!

666
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:42,838
- Where you were?
- I? And you?

667
01:06:43,007 --> 01:06:44,156
- And you?
- And you?

668
01:06:44,327 --> 01:06:46,204
Busqué by all the airplane!

669
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:47,686
- I also!
- Back!

670
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:21,276
It seems that she is safer
the back part of the airplane,

671
01:07:21,447 --> 01:07:23,677
- but there…
- Is not the moment!

672
01:07:23,847 --> 01:07:25,041
Ay?dame.

673
01:07:29,687 --> 01:07:31,086
Buscaremos another way!

674
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:32,965
- Ves!
- Is what I do!

675
01:07:33,127 --> 01:07:34,116
Taken care of!

676
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:35,516
Attention, that way!

677
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:39,438
Profit not to raise it…
Delay…

678
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,276
Delay…

679
01:07:47,407 --> 01:07:48,123
Cay?!

680
01:07:48,927 --> 01:07:49,916
Listening.

681
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,886
You do not understand anything.

682
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:58,957
Continuous.

683
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:09,566
Aguanta!

684
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:17,517
My love!

685
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:32,158
Not you even.
Continuous, we go!

686
01:08:34,847 --> 01:08:37,042
It looks for everything what can
to serve as weapon.

687
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:38,845
Somewhat sharp Tienes?

688
01:08:39,007 --> 01:08:41,282
They confiscated to me
my cortau?as,

689
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:44,644
inlaid with per them.

690
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:47,364
If you had kept it,
we were saved.

691
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:50,087
- We will never know.
- And the ammunition?

692
01:08:50,247 --> 01:08:52,283
5 here, plus a shipper. And you?

693
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:54,039
A shipper, and still 5.

694
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:55,003
Excrement.

695
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,076
And if they were electrocutados?

696
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,120
Good, it has not been obtained.

697
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:10,318
Idiot, tell me that you died.

698
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:20,765
Where you found it?

699
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:23,125
The evacuation lights!

700
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,398
They are not going to take in igniting.

701
01:09:25,927 --> 01:09:27,485
That I hope, to the aim.

702
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,600
It is necessary to find arms.

703
01:09:47,207 --> 01:09:48,356
The cabin does not respond?

704
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:53,001
All died!

705
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,486
It is our turn.

706
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:56,840
Esc?chame well,

707
01:09:57,007 --> 01:09:59,202
we are not going to die,

708
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:00,402
you I promise it.

709
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:02,446
I need your aid.

710
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:04,525
You must be brave.

711
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:21,875
Viste?

712
01:10:22,047 --> 01:10:22,957
What was?

713
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:32,077
Entiendes?

714
01:10:37,607 --> 01:10:38,483
That comes from above.

715
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:46,243
Nondifferent!

716
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:00,838
It is necessary to handle the apparatus.

717
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:02,679
The pilot always is alive?

718
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:05,122
- Treatment to join it.
- It begins again.

719
01:11:16,927 --> 01:11:17,677
Then?

720
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:18,643
Nothing.

721
01:11:18,887 --> 01:11:20,605
It died, we are in
automatic pilotage.

722
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:22,599
Then, we are going to remain in the air?

723
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:24,246
Until it is left kerosene.

724
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:26,000
What would be preferable.

725
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,316
More kerosene?

726
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:30,763
It is necessary to go to the cabin
before they arrive.

727
01:11:30,927 --> 01:11:32,838
You do not have enough balls.

728
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:34,565
The watchman of down has a weapon.

729
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:36,797
We needed it.

730
01:11:36,967 --> 01:11:38,685
Quieres to go down?

731
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:40,644
And if it used its ammunition?

732
01:11:40,807 --> 01:11:41,876
It is a risk.

733
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:12,837
Enchanted to see

734
01:12:13,087 --> 01:12:14,679
that conserves
your sense of humor.

735
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,200
I know that is bared,

736
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:18,324
but I am going to try
to recover the weapon

737
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,239
without exploding the airplane.

738
01:12:20,487 --> 01:12:21,442
So that beams this?

739
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:26,237
I made a promise.
I always have word.

740
01:12:38,127 --> 01:12:40,687
I have a radar contact
with Concord 239.

741
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:43,761
It would have to be visual
in 2 minutes.

742
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:49,119
If this is,

743
01:12:49,287 --> 01:12:51,721
I can go to me
with your new friend?

744
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:04,597
Bennett!

745
01:13:06,927 --> 01:13:07,962
Aguanta!

746
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:15,117
P?nte in contact with the apparatus,
you have three minutes.

747
01:15:15,687 --> 01:15:17,484
To my signal, three minutes.

748
01:15:17,727 --> 01:15:20,446
Received.
Three minutes to put itself in contact.

749
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,044
The roundup and shipment the signal.

750
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:25,076
Sight.

751
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:28,801
I would like that
it was the cavalry…

752
01:15:28,967 --> 01:15:29,797
How goes?

753
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:37,796
The time is urgent.

754
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:39,796
Van to save to us?

755
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:42,356
No, we are single.

756
01:15:42,647 --> 01:15:44,956
If we did not answer,
it is going to demolish to us.

757
01:15:45,127 --> 01:15:47,197
- Is impossible!
- Reason Has.

758
01:15:47,447 --> 01:15:50,439
If we do not respond,
it is going to fire.

759
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:51,562
What we do?

760
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,600
We respond to him.

761
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:56,959
It is necessary to go to the cabin
and to respond to the signal.

762
01:15:57,207 --> 01:15:58,765
Somebody knows to pilot?

763
01:15:59,207 --> 01:16:00,435
Somebody?

764
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:04,876
- Pilotas?
- Not officially.

765
01:16:05,047 --> 01:16:07,641
- But I have bases…
- Bases?

766
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,001
This long ago.

767
01:16:09,287 --> 01:16:11,960
It is enough to us
in order to make work the radio.

768
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:14,405
We do not hope.

769
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:18,597
I follow to you.

770
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:19,756
No, Billy!

771
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:21,804
- You do not leave me.
- I go for there.

772
01:16:22,127 --> 01:16:23,924
Quédate here, this
it is subject mine.

773
01:16:25,607 --> 01:16:27,006
- So that?
- Immediately.

774
01:16:28,847 --> 01:16:29,757
This went away.

775
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:34,361
That mouth.

776
01:16:58,047 --> 01:16:59,366
Pretty conduction.

777
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:16,478
431 to the control tower.

778
01:17:16,647 --> 01:17:17,716
We listened to him.

779
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,242
I do not see anybody piloting.

780
01:17:20,487 --> 01:17:23,479
I repeat,
nobody piloting.

781
01:17:53,687 --> 01:17:54,802
Fast, wanted!

782
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:09,081
Loose, to joder!

783
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:23,599
For lack not to look for to me!

784
01:18:28,847 --> 01:18:29,643
We fall!

785
01:18:33,287 --> 01:18:35,039
I remain.

786
01:18:35,207 --> 01:18:37,198
It sees for there, I must wait for Anna.

787
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:38,038
Ve!

788
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:43,316
No answer.

789
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:45,603
Authorization to fix the target.

790
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:47,166
Please, it repeats.

791
01:18:47,327 --> 01:18:49,602
Authorization to fix the target.

792
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,725
Affirmative.
Authorization to fix the target.

793
01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:15,116
Anger, wanted.

794
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,036
I want to you.

795
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,963
I also, my love.

796
01:19:24,487 --> 01:19:26,125
I always wanted to you.

797
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:37,122
Are you, Bennett?

798
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,326
They see here, son of puta.

799
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:48,516
I want to be safe

800
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:50,678
of which conserves that smile

801
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:52,485
until hell!

802
01:20:20,287 --> 01:20:22,084
Here the 431,

803
01:20:22,287 --> 01:20:24,926
apparently, reactor 3
it is in flames.

804
01:20:48,647 --> 01:20:50,399
Tiene enc?as sagradas!

805
01:21:00,407 --> 01:21:01,396
Vaya, we fall!

806
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:08,926
Where is the autopilot?

807
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,759
- I do not know anything of that!
- Is not equal!

808
01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:15,001
- Sube arrives!
- The mouth no!

809
01:21:21,327 --> 01:21:22,521
AT SIGHT OBJECTIVE

810
01:21:22,687 --> 01:21:23,437
Prepared to shoot.

811
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:29,200
We are alive,
I repeat, alive.

812
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:31,323
Abandone! Abandone!

813
01:21:37,247 --> 01:21:38,043
Fire!

814
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,519
Object in approach.

815
01:21:43,207 --> 01:21:44,560
Had to shoot!

816
01:21:44,727 --> 01:21:46,319
- Fast!
- Already I know!

817
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:48,398
Where is the autopilot?

818
01:21:48,647 --> 01:21:50,239
Imminent impact.

819
01:21:54,847 --> 01:21:55,484
Here!

820
01:21:55,647 --> 01:21:57,603
Deactivated autopilot.

821
01:22:02,567 --> 01:22:03,682
Ready?

822
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:05,242
Civilians on board,

823
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,205
frustrated firing. I repeat, aborted.

824
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:36,599
Recover altitude.

825
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:46,761
Tuviste success!

826
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:01,676
Joder!

827
01:24:05,967 --> 01:24:06,604
A mountain!

828
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:20,761
Agarra the control!

829
01:25:12,967 --> 01:25:14,116
You obtained it, colleague.

830
01:25:14,287 --> 01:25:17,165
What you would say
to leave with expoli?

831
01:25:17,327 --> 01:25:19,761
I already left with poli.

832
01:25:21,647 --> 01:25:26,482
The only thing that knew to do,
it was to rascar the back to me.

833
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:28,319
Still itches to you?

834
01:25:29,007 --> 01:25:30,235
All along.

835
01:25:30,536 --> 01:25:43,636
