My lips are sealed.

733
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,930
I'm not sure who I
 would inform if I could.

734
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,300
What's going to
 happen to you, Alana?

735
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,270
And what about Dara and Rachel?

736
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,520
Dara informs me that
 she has beamed Rachel

737
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,110
back to her native country.

738
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,310
They are not going to be
 happy that she blew her cover.

739
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,370
She's going to be in a
 gulag for a long time.

740
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,490
Well I'm sure that's not the
 only thing she'll be blowing.

741
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,470
As for Dara and
 myself, we must

742
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,200
report back to our home planet.

743
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,640
What are you going
 to report back?

744
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,670
If I were truthful, I would
 report that the planet Earth

745
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,180
is ripe for colonization,
 has the perfect atmosphere,

746
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,600
plenty of fresh water.

747
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,470
But what about us?

748
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,450
I'm afraid that
 in any colonization,

749
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,950
the native population
 is exterminated.

750
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,950
But you can't.

751
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,210
And I won't.

752
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,070
Don't worry, Steve and Candy.

753
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,710
Dara and I will report
 back to the chancellor

754
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,640
that Earth is completely
 unsuitable for colonization.

755
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,960
Really?

756
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,650
That's awful sweet of you.

757
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,930
But then what will
 happen with your people?

758
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,200
There are many millions of
 worlds throughout the galaxy.

759
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,790
I'm sure we'll find one that
 is suitable for our needs,

760
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,480
and that doesn't have such
 lovely people as yourselves.

761
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,950
So you're leaving?

762
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,270
I must go soon.

763
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,950
But I do have time for
 perhaps one last celebration.

It's close enough.

I'm afraid my time here is up.

I have to go.

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,240
I really wish you could stay.

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,420
Yeah, me too.

772
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,710
It was pleasurable
 for me as well.

773
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,490
But as you earthlings
 say, all good things

774
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,290
must come to an end.

775
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,640
Farewell, Candy.

Well, the planet
 is safe, though.

 from this experience,

it's life is too short
 just let things pass by.
