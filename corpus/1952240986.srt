1
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,754
Hey, can you help me?

2
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,457
I need a doctor.

3
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,465
No, my friend,

4
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,832
you need a lawyer.

5
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,369
Call me.

6
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,340
Hey!

7
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,516
Good morning, boys.

8
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,251
Looks like you lost your patient again.

9
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,637
Do I have to separate you two?

10
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,272
Stop it! Stop it!

11
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,817
Stop it!

12
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,784
Wait your turn.

13
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,325
Don't you know everybody
is in here is waiting?

14
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,328
Go take a seat.
Take a seat over there.

15
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,358
Do you have an insurance card?

16
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,834
No.

17
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,337
Take a seat over there,
and fill out these forms.

18
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,930
Where?

19
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,943
Over there.

20
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,410
Sir.

21
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,605
Your eyeball.

22
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,484
Next.

23
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,521
Hey, that's you buddy.

24
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,782
Guess that's me.

25
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,325
I've got this incredibly painful paper cut.

26
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,623
Do you have an insurance card?

27
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,994
Yes, I do.

28
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,295
Code Green! Code Green!

29
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,334
Oh, my goodness!

30
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,640
Nice booty!

31
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,715
Thank you.

32
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,783
Thank you!

33
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,358
Great, on top of everything else,
the circus is in town.

34
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,585
Hey!

35
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,754
Do I have to see all these patients by myself?
Where are my doctors?

36
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,388
They're at a meeting
on electronic charting, Dr. Roskin.

37
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,693
Didn't you get the memo?

38
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,792
No, there's nothing in my box.

39
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,427
I sent it to you by email.

40
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,972
Email, yes, damn computers.

41
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:45,204
Look, find the technology
to page Dr. Callaby. I need help down here.

42
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,074
Dr. Callaby, to the E.R., stat.
Dr. Callaby, to the E.R., stat.

43
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,120
Dr. Callaby, to the E.R., stat.
Dr. Callaby, to the E.R., stat.

44
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:59,453
Oh, too bad, so sad.

45
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,496
Just started this round,
got 1 7 holes to go.

46
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,760
Hey, how nice of you all to join me.

47
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,631
Dr. Murphy, you take the clown in room 5.

48
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,728
Dr. Keefe, you take the headache in room 7.

49
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,806
He's got a headache?

50
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,806
No, he is a headache.

51
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,366
Bonacasa, the mime in
room 9 is all yours.

52
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,471
- What's wrong with the mime?
- Didn't say.

53
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,073
Go, go, go!

54
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,676
Nurse Nancy, if you'd be good enough
to pry yourself away from that screen.

55
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,983
You should be paging
Dr. Ramalama to the E. R.,

56
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,685
and I want Dr. Mills down here
for the FL.K. in room 6.

57
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,989
Can't pay your electric bill?

58
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,964
Sue your doctor.

59
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:45,629
I'm Jake Gorman,
Attorney at Law, and I care for you.

60
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,039
Rat bastard.

61
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,713
Mr. Jenkins? What seems to be
the problem today?

62
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,045
Now, wait a minute.

63
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,588
I don't want some snot-nosed punk
who's not even able to shave yet

64
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,384
telling me he's my doctor.
I want a real doctor.

65
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,052
I am a real doctor, okay?
And I assure you I am most qualified--

66
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,189
Is there a problem here?

67
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,892
No, no problem.

68
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,594
You're damned right there's a problem.

69
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,194
I've been waiting for two hours
to be seen be a real doctor.

70
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,967
One with hair on his pee-pee.

71
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,541
I know my rights.

72
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,008
I'm going to call my lawyer.

73
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,705
I'm Dr. Roskin, Chief of Staff.

74
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,715
I've been running this E. R.
for some 25 years now.

75
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,717
On the pee-pee hair front,

76
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,016
I boast a rather generous
thatch of botanical splendor,

77
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,146
much of it a well-earned gray.

78
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,521
May I see the chart, please?

79
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,959
I see that you've never been vaccinated
against tetanus, rabies, distemper,

80
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,329
Dengue fever, malaria,
rockin' pneumonia or the boogie-woogie flu.

81
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,427
No, that's okay, doc.
I don't need those shots.

82
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,006
Well, medically I'm sure you're right,

83
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,234
but the lawyer you said you would be calling

84
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,106
would call me negligent
if I didn't give them to you,

85
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,148
so, Nurse Helga, please,
if you would assist the young Doctor Keefe.

86
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,410
- Thank you.
- Yes, doctor.

87
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,662
- Dr. Murphy?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,859
There's a patient here who insists
on being seen by you.

89
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,870
Okay, thanks.

90
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,870
Oh!

91
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,372
Thank you very much.

92
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,069
Dr. Murphy?

93
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,307
- Yes?
- Damn glad to meet you.

94
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,178
Oh! This is from Jake Gorman's office.

95
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,252
You've been served.

96
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,287
Have a nice day, doc.

97
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,119
Damn. That's the third malpractice suit
today, you punk!

98
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,620
I don't think that hip is broken at all.

99
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,993
Let's try standing. There.

100
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,191
Yes, good, okay.

101
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,358
- We'll walk a little...
- I quit!

102
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,129
Dr. Murphy.

103
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,603
I try to help these upstanding citizens,
how do they repay me?

104
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,800
By suing me every chance they get.
I'm finished!

105
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,708
Now Bradley, please, don't leave me now.

106
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,837
I'm begging you.
I've got wall-to-wall patients here.

107
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,939
They're going to have to get better
on their own, Richard.

108
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,745
I'm finished. I'm done.

109
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,082
Finito. Gone. Hasta la bye-bye.

110
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,121
Game over.

111
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,190
See this?

112
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,160
Now if you'll excuse me,

113
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,000
I have a clown to kill.

114
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,072
That's it! I need an administrator!

115
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,840
Get Buttkiss down here now!

116
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,280
Mr. Abrams, I'm Gene Buttkiss.

117
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,079
I'm the Chief Administrator
here at North Mercy.

118
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,087
Your health is very important
to you, isn't it, sir?

119
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,713
It sure is.

120
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:56,921
And what would you say it would be worth
for my staff to nurse you back to health?

121
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,054
Well, you can't put a price on health.

122
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,030
- Try.
- A million dollars.

123
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,363
Oh, a million dollars! I like that!

124
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,836
And how much are you
actually going to pay us?

125
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,065
Well, I have no money.

126
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,106
I have no insurance.

127
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,075
Oh! No money? Oh, I see.

128
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,137
So, for a million dollars' worth of service,
you're going to pay us the grand total of,

129
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:20,776
I don't know, for argument's sake
let's just use a ball park figure of nothing!

130
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,684
Zip! Nada! Goose egg!

131
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,518
You are outta here!

132
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,266
I don't know about you, but I feel better.

133
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,837
- Buttkiss!
- Oh, Dr. Roskin. What can I do for you?

134
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,407
Murphy quit. I need more doctors.

135
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,410
More doctors, right, sure,
I'll just pull a few more out of my uh...ear.

136
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,037
I mean it, I don't care where they come
from, I need more docs.

137
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,241
Alright Richard, I'll call corporate headquarters.

138
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,012
But until then,
I've got some medical advice for you.

139
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,145
Don't hold your breath.

140
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,288
Thanks for calling RlP,
sorry for keeping you on hold for so long.

141
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,265
How can I help you?

142
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,960
Hello?

143
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,230
Hello?

144
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,804
Make it quick.

145
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,207
Uh, yeah. Sorry to bother you sir,

146
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,869
Bothering me is your job,

147
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,880
Buttkiss, and you do it very well.

148
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,046
I see.

149
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:33,888
Well, you tell Dr. Roskin
that he'll have his new doctor.

150
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,520
- First thing tomorrow morning.
- Thank you, sir.

151
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,827
I was, um, right, okay, good.

152
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,423
Thank you.

153
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,663
Board members, shareholders,
and executives.

154
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:49,502
It is my honor to serve as president
of RlP Healthcare.

155
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:55,478
As many of you know, I was the owner of the
Bionics and Medical Devices division for years,

156
00:11:55,581 --> 00:12:01,019
what many of you don't know, however,
is that I was born without a heart.

157
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,020
There's no heartbeat.

158
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,419
This baby has no heart.

159
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,295
I was rushed to the neo-natal
intensive care unit,

160
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,161
and there received the first ever

161
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,726
fully-automated internal combustion
artificial heart

162
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,899
ever produced by
the Medical Devices division

163
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,373
of RlP healthcare.

164
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,173
This baby saved my life.

165
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,804
And since the company saved my life,

166
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,850
I thought it was only my
duty to save the company.

167
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,544
And I have.

168
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,919
RlP Healthcare will enjoy a profit

169
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:44,963
of no less than $3 billion
this fiscal quarter alone.

170
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:55,739
But we do have a problem

171
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:01,404
You see, each year we lose literally
hundreds of millions of dollars

172
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:06,110
in medical malpractice lawsuits
brought against our doctors

173
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:12,487
by sleazy, slimy, low-life,

174
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:17,051
blood-sucking, leaching lawyers.

175
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,730
But what can we do?

176
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,827
We're a hospital.

177
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,372
We need doctors,
and doctors make mistakes.

178
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,637
After all, they're only human, right?

179
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,938
Not any more.

180
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,143
What if I were to tell you

181
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,518
that we can have a doctor that works
24 hours a day, seven days a week?

182
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,250
A doctor that knows everything,

183
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,327
a doctor that can do anything,

184
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,554
a doctor that makes no mistakes?

185
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,392
You'd say I was crazy.

186
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,264
You'd say I was
a raving lunatic, wouldn't you?

187
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,669
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

188
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:09,214
I give you the future of medicine.

189
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:14,514
I give you medical device MD-63.

190
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:23,050
Made with the latest space-age composite
materials and microprocessors,

191
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:28,828
packing 350 gigabytes of RAM
and a 2.4 liter air-cooled engine,

192
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:35,601
MD-63 can effectively,
efficiently and inexpensively,

193
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,200
do the work of a dozen human doctors.

194
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,940
MD-63 will now demonstrate his ability

195
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,644
to perform the world's
fastest physical examination.

196
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:52,486
Ah, John from the mail room
was kind enough to volunteer

197
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,922
to be the first patient.

198
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,230
Okay.

199
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,992
MD-63...

200
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,931
...begin.

201
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,218
Oh, my gosh!

202
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,617
He's totally crushing that guy's nuts.
Shut him down!

203
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,086
- I'm trying!
- Shut him down!

204
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,133
We give you $3 billion of research money,

205
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,143
and you give us a defective,
ball-busting bucket of bolts.

206
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,273
Frank, how nice of you to stand up
and volunteer to be the next patient.

207
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,284
Meeting adjourned.

208
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,115
Let's go, hurry up.

209
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,552
You.

210
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,752
Get that high-tech, groin-grabbing,

211
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,591
crotch-crunching nutcracker fixed! Now.

212
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,464
MD-63 starts tomorrow morning
at North Mercy hospital.

213
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,765
Did you say North Mercy?

214
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,429
Did you say tomorrow?

215
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,532
Yes, have you got a problem with that?

216
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,201
No, no. No problem.

217
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,938
Good.

218
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:25,449
Because he will be in that hospital
tomorrow as a doctor,

219
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,989
or the two of you will be in the hospital
as patients.

220
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,821
Pasqual, stay with them,
make sure they get it done.

221
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,103
Look at my client!

222
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:51,109
Look at the hideous scar you left across
his forehead, Doctor... um...

223
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,302
Sosumi!

224
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,244
Doctor, I am suing you!

225
00:16:55,347 --> 00:17:00,284
No, no, my name is Dr. Sosumi.

226
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,248
Okay, then, Doctor.

227
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,594
What possible justification
can you have for leaving that horrible scar?

228
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,963
I had to operate to save his life.

229
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,559
To save his life!

230
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,128
What kind of life do you think
my client's going to have now,

231
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,176
now that you've butchered his skull?

232
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,270
My client may look like a monster,

233
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,849
but you, you doctor,

234
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,145
are the monster.

235
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:40,082
Doctor, did you warn my client,

236
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,456
Mr. Martin,

237
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,292
that he was going to have a horrible scar

238
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,859
before you ruthlessly
and maliciously hacked open his skull?

239
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,804
No, he fall off bar stool.
He was unconscious. He was in coma.

240
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,103
Oh, I see.

241
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,145
Hey! He was unconscious, he was in a coma,

242
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,941
so you figured, what the hell?

243
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,482
I can do whatever I wanted.

244
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,781
What if you wanted to have sex with him?

245
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,390
Did you, doctor? Did you
have sex with Mr. Martin?

246
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,890
- Did you?
- What? You're crazy!

247
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,257
Did you flip him over
and do the horizontal hula?

248
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,396
Order! Order in the court!

249
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,198
No more questions, Your Honor.

250
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,900
The sight of this...

251
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,472
...doctor makes me sick.

252
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,825
Yeah, $2 million dollars for a scar

253
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,894
on a drunk whose life isn't worth a nickel.

254
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:54,591
Don't worry, you'll get
your usual finders fee.

255
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,534
Hey, I gotta go, I got some business
I gotta chase down.

256
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,831
Thanks, buddy.

257
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,738
You're welcome, Jake. Very welcome.

258
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,847
Thank you for coming, Dr. Mills.

259
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,358
Looks like you've found
another patient for your clinic.

260
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,464
I'm a afraid your son is cross-eyed.

261
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,960
Has Dr. Callaby come down yet?

262
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:33,969
What are you doing?

263
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,199
Charting vital signs.

264
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,935
And who is taking these vital signs?

265
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,840
The machine over there.

266
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,743
So you're telling this machine
what that machine is doing?

267
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,282
Yeah, that's my job.

268
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,318
Oh, we're the people
whose job it is to take care of the patients.

269
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,216
See, that's what they look like.

270
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,984
They're over there, those living
actual human things over there.

271
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,252
We have too many of those,
not enough nurses,

272
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,555
not enough doctors, not enough time,
and too many computers.

273
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,994
Are you listening to me?

274
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,497
No, because you're talking to a computer.

275
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,537
Let me guess. You're the mime.

276
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,629
I'll take that as a yes.

277
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,729
What seems to be the problem?

278
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,701
Your nose...

279
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,005
... is running.
You have a runny nose.

280
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,137
Anything else?

281
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,916
Your throat...

282
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,612
sounds like...

283
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,622
saw...sore! Your throat is sore.

284
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,319
That's really funny,
a mime with a sore throat.

285
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,329
Here, why don't you have a lozenge,
and I'll write you a prescription.

286
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,899
Don't be afraid, I'm a doctor.

287
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,627
Go ahead.

288
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,940
You know, it's kind of funny,

289
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,441
when I was a kid, I really wanted to be a mime.

290
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,947
I used to do that box thing
for hours, I'd be like...

291
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,982
You know?

292
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,611
What? It's not that bad.
You don't have to be insulting, buddy.

293
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,783
Oh, my God!

294
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,018
Come here.

295
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,426
Oh, excuse me.

296
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,799
- Out of the way!
- Got a live one here!

297
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,635
- Watch out.
- Come on.

298
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,676
Dr. Callaby, we need you right now!

299
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,005
We got a multiple trauma.

300
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,580
He's got an open head injury,
a ruptured spleen,

301
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,444
and chopped liver.

302
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,744
His BP is 25 over 5.

303
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,659
This guy's a mess.
I don't have time for this today.

304
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,733
I have to be on the golf
course in ten minutes.

305
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,460
Everyone on my count,

306
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,865
one, two,

307
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,164
three!

308
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,846
Dr. Callaby, that man is going to die unless
you
get him into surgery right now.

309
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,513
That man is going to die
no matter what I do right now.

310
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,147
So, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather be playing golf.

311
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,818
You walk out, I report you
to the state medical board.

312
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,521
Oh, and while you're at it,

313
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,791
why don't you inform them
that I am the only doctor on staff

314
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,129
that has never been sued for malpractice.

315
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,761
If you'll excuse me, the green is calling.

316
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,135
Get back here, Callaby.
I'm going to count to three.

317
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,832
One, two, three...

318
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,137
Fore!

319
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,718
It's getting late.

320
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,118
You guys finished with this tin can yet?

321
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:42,717
Well, I adjusted his tactile sensors
so he doesn't crush anymore...right.

322
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:47,663
And right now, I'm scanning this month's
medical journals to update his database.

323
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,028
We're almost done, okay?

324
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,726
He'll be ready by morning.

325
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,827
He better be.

326
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,803
Damn it.

327
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,742
If this doesn't work, we're both dead.

328
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,907
Speaking of dead,
I better have a talk with Lauren Mills

329
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,984
before we bring him up
on the floor tomorrow.

330
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,188
Whaddya say we just
get a last meal?

331
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,157
How about pizza?

332
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,251
Sounds good, let's go.

333
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,683
Hey!

334
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,591
Rise and shine.

335
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,096
That includes you, Mr. Mime Molester.

336
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,223
What?

337
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,664
What did I do?

338
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,895
Nothing, other than the mime.

339
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,199
Come on. I didn't do the mime.

340
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:05,936
In my country, it is strictly forbidden to have
sexual relations with mimes.

341
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,207
Bearded ladies, yes, but mimes, never.

342
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,248
What country are you from?

343
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,580
I'm from Akmannycaca,
we are listed first in the U.N. phone book.

344
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,483
Did you hear me?

345
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,648
Come on, we've got a backlog from last night.
Look at this.

346
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,989
We have 38...

347
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,621
...37 patients to see.

348
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,131
He was in my parking spot.

349
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,033
We've been through this Jason.

350
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,934
I know we talked about this.

351
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,701
I just wanna be sure you understand.

352
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,767
I just, I want you to be prepared.

353
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,938
I know you were in love with my brother,

354
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,710
but this isn't him.

355
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,916
It's created in his image.

356
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,288
But it's a machine, it isn't human.

357
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,055
He isn't-- It isn't Robert.

358
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,291
It was a long time ago.

359
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,300
I'm over it.

360
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,030
Then why do you
still wear the watch he gave you?

361
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,272
I need to know the time.

362
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,923
Richard, I've got some
great news for you!

363
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,458
I found you another doctor.

364
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,959
Oh, thank goodness.

365
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,551
Welcome aboard, Doctor...

366
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,290
Uh, I'm not the doctor.

367
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,923
This is your doctor.

368
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,296
Hello, Dr. Roskin.

369
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,893
I'm Medical Device model number MD-63.

370
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,839
I'm a new mechanized, computerized,
physician replacement.

371
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,178
This is a-- This is a good joke.

372
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,579
What? A hidden camera
around here somewhere?

373
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,345
I'll just let you two get acquainted.

374
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,187
That's funny, it is.

375
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,883
It's no joke, doctor.

376
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,826
I'm Jason Dockery,
M. D. 63's chief technician.

377
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,921
I'm here to get you acquainted
with his features.

378
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,590
Features?

379
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,361
I asked Buttkiss for a doctor with a pulse,

380
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,834
I don't need an
overgrown coffee maker.

381
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,031
Coffee? Would you like it black?

382
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,334
Or with cream and sugar?

383
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,411
Buttkiss!

384
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,290
Maybe he wanted tea?

385
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,154
Buttkiss! You promised me a doctor!

386
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,663
You've given me a vending machine
with a stethoscope.

387
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,858
So you've met M.D. 63.

388
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,368
I hear he's a very expensive,
highly-specialized device.

389
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,837
I don't need a device.
I need a living, breathing doctor.

390
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,238
Well, forget it!
Look around, Richard.

391
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,140
Lawsuits, malpractice rates,

392
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,677
decreasing reimbursements.

393
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,748
All the breathing doctors are quitting.

394
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:02,786
Just give it a chance. Maybe you'll learn
something from this robot doctor.

395
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,752
And I need another nurse!

396
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,257
One made of flesh would be nice.

397
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,097
Half-caf, triple grande,
three sugars, soy.

398
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,000
No whipped mocha.

399
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,732
Me, too.

400
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,775
Come on, Doctor Coffee,
we're late for rounds.

401
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,447
Back straight, stomach out a tiny bit,

402
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,176
put your feet down,
right in the middle...

403
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,752
Gentlemen! Let us begin.

404
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,846
Allow me to introduce the
newest addition to our staff.

405
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,586
This is what corporate now
refers to as a physician.

406
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,288
Wait a minute,
you have got to be kidding.

407
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,386
Is he a...

408
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,399
Yes, right down to his CPU.

409
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,128
Dr. Keefe, your presentation.

410
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,966
Speaking of P.U.,

411
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,974
Mrs. Flaherty is a morbidly obese,

412
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,134
flatulent, malodorous--

413
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:03,613
Alright, okay, we get the point,
she's fat and smelly.

414
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:07,412
Mrs. Flaherty is a 52-year-old woman
who is suffering from abdominal pain.

415
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,148
Let me take a look.

416
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,746
Mrs. Flaherty,

417
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,848
does it hurt when I do this?

418
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,126
Does it hurt when I do this?

419
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,597
Mrs. Flaherty,
when was the last time you ate?

420
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,262
About ten minutes ago.

421
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,468
Ah. And what did you eat?

422
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,203
I had a rack of lamb,

423
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,505
a side of beef,

424
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,977
four fried chickens,

425
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,048
and some Chinese.

426
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,878
Ah, some Chinese food?

427
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,078
Or some Chinese people?

428
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,283
Doctors, it appears that
Mrs. Flaherty has...

429
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,919
an old-fashioned stomach-ache.

430
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,989
If we're all in agreement, let's get her
some antacid and get her out of here.

431
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,035
I disagree.

432
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,604
Oh, the toaster speaks.

433
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,538
This woman has acute appendicitis.

434
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,441
I've seen her naked.
Trust me, she doesn't have a cute anything.

435
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,013
She needs surgery now.

436
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,983
Okay, I am not going to
stand here and justify myself

437
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,950
to some motorized mannequin.

438
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,421
I am Chief of Surgery,
and I say she's out of here.

439
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:20,650
She's outta here!

440
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,923
If you do not open her up, I will.

441
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,500
You couldn't open a can of beans, tin man.

442
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,366
Well, actually--

443
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,486
Fine!

444
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,955
Go right ahead.

445
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,150
But who's going to help you, huh?

446
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,024
MD-63 doesn't need any help.

447
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,256
He shifts automatically
between anesthesiologist,

448
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,027
surgeon and scrub nurse mode.

449
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,005
One red hot appendix, doctor.

450
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,975
What is he doing now?

451
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:24,544
Since MD-63 is programmed to perform
the duties of 58 medical sub specialists,

452
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,557
he can diagnose and treat
any patient all on his own.

453
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,368
Mama!

454
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,704
What the hell did you do to her?

455
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:54,615
An appendectomy. I also
took the liberty of performing liposuction,

456
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,279
tummy tuck, face lift
and breast augmentation.

457
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,915
Thank you, doctor.

458
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,583
Beginner's luck.

459
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,094
Ma'am, we're going to have
to repeat that exam.

460
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,323
Yeah, right buddy.

461
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,937
He was my creation, you know.

462
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,703
I created him.

463
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,451
Just because they've installed in you
all of the finest, latest medical technology,

464
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,384
that doesn't make you a real doctor.

465
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,820
Bonacasa, will you show "it" around?

466
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,255
Yes, sir.

467
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,190
Don't worry about him.

468
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,262
He's still trying to figure
out how to use his cell phone.

469
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,562
I hit it, I hit it!

470
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,268
There you are, sweetie.

471
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,469
You need to stay in the clinic, okay?

472
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,007
I hope he didn't hurt...you.

473
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:03,179
Dr. Mills, this is MD-63

474
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,381
Have you met before?

475
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,720
No, it's just he...

476
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,521
... reminds me of
someone I used to know.

477
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,153
Perhaps it's one of my prototypes.

478
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,027
I've been told I bear
a striking resemblance

479
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:19,160
to MD models 48, 57, and 59 through 61.

480
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,738
The nurses are all talking about you.

481
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,469
They call you RoboDoc.
You can call me Lauren.

482
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,636
I run the children's clinic.

483
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,179
You're a pediatrician?

484
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,374
With a sub-specialization
in cross-eyed children.

485
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,110
We hope to cure them one day.

486
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,710
Dr. Von Schmekel in Germany
is doing some wonderful research.

487
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,849
But until they find a cure, I teach them
to function in a straight-eyed world.

488
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,929
Yeah. Well, it looks like
you're doing a bang-up job.

489
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,229
Cute kid.

490
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,239
If you'll excuse us, I've got to show
RoboDoc around the hospital.

491
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,206
It was nice meeting you.

492
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,705
I hit the ball! I hit the ball!

493
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,476
Yes, you did, Joey.
Yes, you did.

494
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,355
I think I see the problem.

495
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:19,556
Is RoboCrock qualified to handle
psychiatric patients?

496
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,156
Psychiatry isn't in his
automated menu, however,

497
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,497
I can put him in that mode, manually.

498
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,436
With this psychiatry memory stick.

499
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,987
Did they follow you here?

500
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,422
They who?

501
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,824
They! The ClA.,

502
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,555
F.B. I., K.G.B.,

503
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,528
N.R.A., A.A. R.P.,

504
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,463
N.A.A.C.P.!.

505
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,535
No.

506
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,628
Listen, Doc, you gotta help me.

507
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,606
The space aliens can read my mind.

508
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,906
They put a chip in my head, doc.

509
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,741
Sir,

510
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,339
there's nothing wrong with
having a chip in your head.

511
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,247
Doc! Oh, no!

512
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,258
They got you, too.

513
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:38,206
That certainly did not produce
the intended therapeutic effect.

514
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,368
Doctor, come quick we
have a patient crashing.

515
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,946
Let's see how you handle this one.

516
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,515
He just stopped breathing.

517
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,849
Perhaps he's angry at his mother.

518
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,583
What?

519
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,216
Tell me, what was your childhood like?

520
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,319
Oh, he's still in psychiatrist mode.
He's absolutely useless.

521
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,419
Get him out of here.

522
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,465
We've lost his pulse.

523
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,535
Go ahead, call a code,
get the crash cart.

524
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,602
No time for that.

525
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,969
Clear.

526
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,180
Thanks, Doc.

527
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,250
I feel great.

528
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,721
Did you say something about my mother?.

529
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,764
Hi.

530
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,735
I'm new Nurse Fonda,
Fonda Johnsons.

531
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,308
Guys?

532
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,933
Hello?

533
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,376
Hello?

534
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,243
Not to be offensive in any way,

535
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,839
but you seem to be so well...

536
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,216
put together-- You're not a robot?

537
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,618
Excuse me?

538
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,553
Are you real?

539
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,523
Well, most of me is.

540
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,619
Mr. Buttkiss said I can't start working
until I get my employment physical.

541
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,929
So, which one of your strong and handsome
young doctors wants to do it?

542
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,806
I think I just did it in my pants.

543
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,568
RoboCrock,

544
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:55,476
how about you performing
the employment exam on Nurse Johnsons?

545
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,548
Certainly, chief.

546
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,082
Right this way, miss.

547
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,711
If you need any help, my teeth
make a great panty retractor.

548
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,083
Charming.

549
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,961
Now, all we have left is a pelvic exam.

550
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,963
Hop into the stirrups.

551
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,296
Well, it's not like you'll
be the first mechanical device in there.

552
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,732
But I'm warning you,

553
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,896
I've always found these
exams rather unpleasant.

554
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:26,443
Don't worry, I will do everything possible
to make this a pleasurable experience.

555
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,764
I think I just did it again.

556
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,869
Everything is fine
except for those unusual pelvic spasms.

557
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,778
No smoking!

558
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,410
Good morning.

559
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,881
I took the liberty of drawing blood,
reviewing charts,

560
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,714
performing surgery,
and discharging most of our patients.

561
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,085
I also made coffee for you.

562
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,384
In the doctor's lounge.

563
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,981
Wow.

564
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,288
What time did you get in this morning?

565
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,296
I never left. I do not need to sleep.

566
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,889
If you did all of the work
on our patients last night,

567
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,627
what are we going to do?

568
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:36,105
We are going to go on rounds.

569
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,799
How about a round of golf?

570
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:41,139
That's your Mulligan.
Let's tee it up, boys.

571
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,543
Golf? What is golf?

572
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,483
Well, you hit a ball into a cup 1 8 times.

573
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,713
What is the point?

574
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,018
I don't know.

575
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,788
Do you like whacking balls?

576
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,955
Callaby, we're on medical rounds.
We don't need a surgeon.

577
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,794
See, Dick?. I'm just here
for the entertainment.

578
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,392
I might even learn something
from Dr. Scissorhands, huh?

579
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,734
Doctor Bonacasa, present your patient.

580
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,002
Mr. Malaka is a 45-year-old white male

581
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,805
with a five-day history
of high fever and rash.

582
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,039
All the classic symptoms
of Lyme Disease.

583
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:21,175
But he's not yet responded
to the appropriate antibiotic medication.

584
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,777
Well, perhaps we should
switch to a more broad spectrum coverage.

585
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,915
Well, I don't know.
Maybe he has appendicitis, too.

586
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:32,394
Has anybody asked the walking can opener
what he thinks?

587
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,760
I need to analyze a urine sample.

588
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,629
- By all means.
- Thank you.

589
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,518
I'd hate to be here when
he analyzes a stool sample.

590
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,646
Mr. Malaka has tricinyphlis.

591
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:00,985
Yeah, what's that?

592
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,889
That's an incredibly rare disease.

593
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,462
You can only get it by having sex with pigs.

594
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,964
That's crazy. Absolutely crazy.

595
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,558
I mean, this mechanical moron
must have blown a circuit board.

596
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,137
Tricinyphlis.

597
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,103
There's only been ever
five confirmed cases.

598
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,702
Six.

599
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,941
How disgusting. Not even in my country
do we have sex with pigs.

600
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,681
Sheeps, yes, goats, yes.

601
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,313
Pigs? Never.

602
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,123
See, to you, this may look
like an inflamed gall bladder,

603
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,260
but to me, this is payment
on my country club membership.

604
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,231
Oh! Three-pointer.

605
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,642
Doctor Callaby, there's
a very important call for you.

606
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,145
Well, it better be very important.

607
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,943
This man's aneurysm's about to burst.

608
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,983
Don't move a muscle.

609
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,313
I'll be right back.

610
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,649
Hello?

611
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,388
Jake! Jake,
where have you been?

612
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,862
Where have I been?
Where have I been?

613
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,023
I was in court.

614
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,629
Defending the rights of the downtrodden,
hard-working little people.

615
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,229
Damn, this coffee's hot!

616
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,534
I almost burned my tongue.

617
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,167
What are you trying to do to me?

618
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,806
So, you got another
malpractice case for me?

619
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,317
No! That's the problem.

620
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,786
We got this new robotic doctor thingy
here at the hospital.

621
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,981
It never makes a mistake.

622
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,455
Robo-- Doctor?

623
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,117
Keep an eye on that tin can.

624
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,162
Study it. It's our next meal ticket.

625
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,322
It must have a weakness.

626
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,627
But it knows everything.

627
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,693
You figure out a way
for me to sue that robot

628
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:59,538
or my next malpractice case
will be against you.

629
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,678
Jake, you don't mean that.

630
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,373
Jake?

631
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,008
Jakey?

632
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,211
Jake?

633
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,328
I'm afraid her breasts were so small
we had to put them on life support.

634
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,867
- Do you mean...
- Yes.

635
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,766
We had to put her on a "breast-perator."

636
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,341
What are her chances?

637
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,409
Not very good.

638
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,211
Unless we can find her
a pair of donor breasts.

639
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,317
I know, I know.

640
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:52,020
I lost my college girlfriend the same way.

641
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,256
Doctor! Doctor! Great news!

642
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,492
A busload of strippers
just went over a cliff,

643
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,495
we have a cooler full of donor breasts.

644
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,201
That's incredible!

645
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,102
How do you suppose
something like that could have happened?

646
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,965
Oh, if I keep eating this food,
I'm going to need a doctor.

647
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,062
There's a hair in my sandwich.

648
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,868
This is disgusting.

649
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,340
I think the food is good, very good.

650
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,070
Really?

651
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,011
In my country, we don't
eat three meals a day.

652
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,139
We only eat on very special occasions.

653
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,239
Like when?

654
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,876
Like when we have food.

655
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,887
Hey guys, here comes dessert.

656
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,084
Hey.

657
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,353
Whaddya say you and me
get together some time?

658
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,487
Oh, I don't think I'm right for you.

659
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,531
If I remember correctly,

660
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,267
you like the strong, silent type.

661
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,434
I didn't do the mime.

662
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,699
Yeah.

663
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,775
Hey, Kim.

664
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:16,175
Hey, I just want to let you know,
I think you're an excellent nurse.

665
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,009
Aw, thanks.

666
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,015
But complimenting me
on my professionalism

667
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,915
is not going to get you into my pants.

668
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,113
Oh, then what will?

669
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:36,723
Come on, Doc, give it to me straight,
I can take it.

670
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,029
You are going to die.

671
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,435
Oh my God, how long have I got?

672
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,337
According to my calculations,
you have two months,

673
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,809
three weeks, six days, 1 8 hours,

674
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,107
47 minutes and nine seconds.

675
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,981
Eight, seven, six, five...

676
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,814
Is there any hope?

677
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,887
No.

678
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,421
Will there be much pain?

679
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,354
Oh yes, very much so.

680
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:02,356
Unbearable.

681
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:06,395
Oh! What should I do, Doc?

682
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,863
Write a will. Buy a nice suit.

683
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,934
Roboshock.

684
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,502
Can I speak to you for a moment?

685
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,131
Certainly, chief. Have a nice day.

686
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,878
Look, I don't mean to be overly critical,

687
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,074
but we've got to work
on your bedside manner.

688
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,151
What do you mean, chief?

689
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,415
I mean, you can't be
that direct and blunt with a patient.

690
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,546
Why not?

691
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,216
Because, it's just not...

692
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,792
Can you add anything here?

693
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,523
Well, I can't program in compassion, Doctor,

694
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,861
but I know he can learn from others.

695
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,272
Now there's a beautiful doll.

696
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,606
What's her name, sweetheart?

697
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,839
This is Donna, the "Stranger Danger" doll.

698
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,444
You're not a friend of mine, guy.

699
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,349
You're a pervert.
Get away from me!

700
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,353
Get away!

701
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,323
Charming.

702
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,524
Well,

703
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,534
I didn't know kids were still playing
cowboys and lndians anymore.

704
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,504
They're not. They're playing cow persons
and Native Americans.

705
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,004
Cute.

706
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,442
Look, the real reason I'm here is

707
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:33,482
RoboCrock, he needs
a lesson in compassion.

708
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,750
Evidently.

709
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,415
Would you be willing to teach him?

710
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,492
Well, someone has to.

711
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,424
I'll see what I can do.

712
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,989
Good. Then I'll leave him-- it--

713
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,466
in your hands this afternoon.

714
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:53,536
Okay.

715
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,403
Let's go.

716
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,075
How can I explain compassion?

717
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,173
Compassion. It is a sympathetic
consciousness of another's distress,

718
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,479
together with the desire to alleviate it.

719
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,110
Very good.

720
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:16,284
For a moment there, I forgot I was talking
to a walking encyclopedia.

721
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:21,160
Simply stated, it's the
giving of aid and comfort.

722
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,462
For instance, look over there.

723
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,433
All of God's creatures need to eat.

724
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,027
Feeding them is an act of compassion.

725
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:34,270
And for that, I believe that nice woman
will be rewarded.

726
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:46,277
How do you know
so much about compassion?

727
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,620
I really don't know.

728
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,684
I guess I'd rather feel sorry for someone else
than feel sorry for myself.

729
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,163
I lost someone.

730
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,327
Someone really close to me.

731
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,701
He was killed in a car accident.

732
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,296
He was killed by a...

733
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,733
He was killed by a...

734
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,572
Drunk driver.

735
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,842
No, a cross-eyed driver.

736
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,214
So this is why you decided
to dedicate yourself

737
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,688
to curing cross-eyed kids.

738
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,385
It's the way I've chosen
to care about people.

739
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,757
I have over 500 trillion
gigabytes of memory

740
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,557
full of how to care for people.

741
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,393
I'm an expert in caring for people.

742
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,991
That may be true, but you need
to care about them as well.

743
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,334
If I'm not human,
how can I care about people?

744
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,534
You don't have to be
human to care about people.

745
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,406
Dolphins care about people,

746
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,069
dogs care about people,

747
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,672
cats...well, the point is that

748
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,580
people are insecure, frightened

749
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,277
fearful creatures.

750
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,116
They're not machines.

751
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,747
They need to be reassured
that everything's going to be okay.

752
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,189
Even if it isn't.

753
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,394
Everything is going to be okay.

754
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,865
Not convincing.

755
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:09,462
It wouldn't hurt if you smile or something.

756
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,734
- Smile?
- Yeah, smile.

757
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,366
Like this.

758
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,480
It's a start.

759
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,748
You know, as a doctor,
you may be perfect,

760
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,882
but as a human,
you've got a long way to go.

761
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,198
You have a deep laceration on your leg,

762
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,707
which has become secondarily infected.

763
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,777
Huh?

764
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,438
You are infected with
a flesh-eating bacteria,

765
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,448
and will require more extensive treatment.

766
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,677
Flesh-eating bacteria?

767
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,778
That sounds horrible.

768
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,254
It is not so bad.

769
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,825
All of God's creatures need to eat.

770
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,257
Yeah?

771
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,352
The bacteria need
to eat somebody's flesh.

772
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:11,025
And I admire your compassion
in letting them eat yours.

773
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,168
Of course, there is a chance
you may lose your leg.

774
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,797
A chance?

775
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,344
Like, a 1 0% chance?

776
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,710
No, like a 99% chance.

777
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:29,479
But, when you wake up,
you'll have a brand new leg.

778
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,350
It is not so bad having an artificial leg.

779
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:33,514
I've got two.

780
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,889
That's incredible.

781
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,328
Will I get one like that?

782
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,592
Not exactly.

783
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,396
My legs cost over $1 0 million each.

784
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,870
With your health plan,
your new leg will look more like...

785
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,275
...this.

786
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,778
The best part is

787
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:02,375
the bacteria will no longer
be able to eat your new leg.

788
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,479
Of course, you'll have to worry
about woodpeckers and termites.

789
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,787
But don't worry.

790
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:13,329
Everything will be okay.

791
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:23,430
I think we still have some work to do
in the compassion department.

792
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,802
Yeah.

793
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,512
Scalpel.

794
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,676
Scalpel.

795
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:37,742
Dr. Callaby, a Dr. Gorman
on the phone for you.

796
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,879
Uh, yes.

797
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,322
He's coming now.

798
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,858
Hello?

799
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,521
Callaby, where the hell
are my malpractice cases?

800
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,792
I'm doing the best I can,
but this boy's infallible

801
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,231
and he's only getting better.

802
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,495
He's only a machine.

803
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,195
He has to have a weakness.

804
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,636
Find it!

805
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,139
RoboDoc is a huge success.

806
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,046
I've never seen such glowing evaluations.

807
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,482
"RoboDoc saved my life."

808
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,316
"RoboDoc made my labor
and delivery so easy,

809
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,754
I wished I was having his baby."

810
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:22,847
Not me, the person...

811
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,826
No one cares, Buttkiss.

812
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,556
Delivering babies...

813
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:31,395
We need him to do
something really big.

814
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,834
If we can get that freaky,
waxy face of his

815
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,772
splattered on the cover
of every newspaper in the country, then...

816
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,866
...then, Buttkiss,

817
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:44,936
our stock would go through the roof.

818
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,017
Excuse me sir, the newest
Public Service Announcement

819
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,485
for the Cross-Eyed Children's Clinic
is ready for your review.

820
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,226
I wanna be a pilot.

821
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:13,671
I wanna be a doctor.

822
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,971
Don't touch me.

823
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,046
I'm calling the police!

824
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,809
Please donate generously
to the Cross-eyed Children's Clinic

825
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,714
of North Mercy Hospital.

826
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,650
There. The cross-eyed kids.

827
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,418
Yeah, I know. It's horrible.

828
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:30,959
No, Buttkiss.

829
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,928
If RoboDoc could cure them,

830
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:39,900
then... I'd be a billionaire.

831
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,970
What am I saying?
I am a billionaire.

832
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:48,135
I'd be a...

833
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,541
Gazillionaire.

834
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,547
Gazillionaire.

835
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,640
Nice work, Buttkiss.

836
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,854
The cafeteria's gotta
get rid of this 10W-40.

837
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,824
He's only supposed to have synthetic.

838
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,021
When you finish with him,
do you think you could rotate my tires?

839
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:12,826
Oh, quite a setup you have here. Yes.

840
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,927
Very impressive.

841
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,940
It's just been amazing how you've
been able to put RoboDoc together.

842
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,634
It was nothing, really.

843
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,177
Anybody with
a Master's degree from MlT,

844
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,439
a Ph. D from Harvard,
and a certificate from

845
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,015
the ACS Automotive Technical
lnstitute could've done it.

846
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,814
Well, I've been very impressed
with RoboDoc's job performance.

847
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,683
It seems he never makes a mistake.

848
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:36,020
He doesn't.
His programming won't allow it.

849
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:40,495
Really? Tell me more.

850
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,693
You ever hear the term
"Garbage in, garbage out"?

851
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,235
Any computer system is only as good

852
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,004
as the information you put into it.

853
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,005
While I'm changing his oil and brake fluid,

854
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,133
Kevin here is scanning the latest
medical journals into his database.

855
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:59,375
And, um, how does all
of this information, uh,

856
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,780
get into his head?

857
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,819
It doesn't.

858
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,855
His head... is empty.

859
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,719
The only thing in his head
is this communications module.

860
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,158
Any information he needs,

861
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,196
he retrieves from this database.

862
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:16,458
For example, we just finished scanning

863
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,194
an article on how
to surgically repair cross-eyed kids.

864
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,533
There's no such cure.
Can I see that?

865
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,608
Sure, but I don't think
you'll understand it.

866
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,972
I am a highly experienced doctor.

867
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,669
I assure you--

868
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,179
I don't understand this.
This is written in German.

869
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,548
It's a new procedure
written by Dr. Von Schmekel

870
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,984
from the University of Dusseldorf.

871
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,078
It hasn't been translated yet,

872
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:44,490
But that's okay, because RoboDoc
knows 78 human languages,

873
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:48,257
55 computer languages,
and 1 5 animal languages.

874
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,854
Impressive.

875
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,696
And right now, we're getting him ready
to perform the new surgery

876
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,532
to cure all the kids
in the Cross-eyed Clinic.

877
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,768
You don't say.

878
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,777
Well, thank you
so much for the tour.

879
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,973
It's been enlightening,

880
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,107
and I hope you seal him up tight.

881
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,584
Wouldn't want RoboDoc
to blow a gasket

882
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,314
at the medical staff
dinner tonight, would we?

883
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,988
The medical staff dinner?
Damn! I forgot.

884
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,962
Kevin, run out,
rent RoboDoc a tuxedo.

885
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,532
I'll pick up some chrome polish.

886
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,328
We gotta make him shine tonight.

887
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,733
I'm on it.

888
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,072
And she has the most beautiful hair.

889
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,671
It's so silky, so smooth.

890
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:42,876
Enough already.
I've heard this from you a million times.

891
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:47,116
Just this once, why don't you tell her.

892
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,750
Nurse Kim.

893
00:58:56,499 --> 00:59:00,435
I don't know what to say to you,
I think you're so beautiful.

894
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,995
Thanks. I've got work to do.

895
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,107
Wait. Wait.

896
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:12,409
I... I know we'll have beautiful
babies together.

897
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,073
You wanna have a baby.

898
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:20,854
Well, why didn't you say so?

899
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,580
Uh, easy.

900
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,742
I just hit the switch.

901
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,821
You sure did, baby.

902
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,171
All right, quiet on the set, everybody.

903
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,797
Ready on camera three.
Have still store two buffered and ready.

904
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:16,436
Jake, ready.
And, uh, three, two...

905
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,639
Is your baby ugly?

906
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,943
Sue your doctor.

907
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,211
Not feeling springtime fresh?

908
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,050
Sue your doctor.

909
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,089
Have you lost a testicle, an eyeball,

910
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:31,183
or some other small but
pricey piece of your body?

911
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,262
Sue your doctor.

912
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:37,356
Because of some greedy
doctor's negligence,

913
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,904
this sweet 98-year old woman

914
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:48,808
won't live to see her great-great-
great-great-grandchildren.

915
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:52,813
With my help,
she's gonna sue her doctor.

916
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:58,444
I'm Jake Gorman, attorney-at-law,
and I care for you.

917
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:02,424
And cut.

918
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,958
Jeez!

919
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,028
Would somebody change
the old bat's diaper?

920
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,427
She's carrying
the grandmother lode in there.

921
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,964
I just can't get that taste out of my mouth.
What do they feed these people?

922
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,267
Phone call for Mr. Gorman.

923
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:21,535
Hello?

924
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:26,308
Jakey, baby! Great news. It's Dr. C.

925
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,216
I not only found out a
way to take RoboDoc down,

926
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:35,052
but also make us very, very, very rich.

927
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:38,389
Wait. Wait, let me get this straight.

928
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:41,895
Blind kids? Oh, this is fantastic.

929
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,125
Hang on a second, let me add this up.

930
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,497
Loss of sight in one eye
is worth $1 million.

931
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,400
Times two eyes per blind kid,

932
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:54,340
plus $50 million in punitive damages
against RlP Healthcare,

933
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,311
minus 60% for those
stinking blind kids,

934
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:01,975
that leaves us with a grand total of...

935
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,988
Garbage in.

936
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,453
Good, Joey. Swing it harder.

937
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,836
Don't you wanna play
with the other children, sweetie?

938
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,273
No. I can't get it to work right.

939
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,345
What, honey,
what won't work right?

940
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,505
This game.
When I try to swing the axe

941
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,311
to chop off their heads,
the screen freezes.

942
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,112
So sorry, sweetie.

943
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,120
Let me give it a try.

944
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,324
Let me take a look at it.

945
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,862
I know a little something about computers.

946
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,296
Okay, that would be great.
Thank you.

947
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,088
It's not Robert.

948
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,351
It's just a machine.

949
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,960
Hi, RoboDoc.

950
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,565
Are you going to the dinner tonight?

951
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,430
Yes, I will be there.

952
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,401
Well, good,

953
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:41,704
'cause I'm gonna wear
something special just for you.

954
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,583
Excuse me.

955
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,621
I don't care if he is a robot,

956
01:04:56,726 --> 01:05:00,753
I'm gonna make him a man tonight.

957
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,408
Fill your pockets, fill your cheeks,

958
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,274
this is the best free food
you'll see for weeks.

959
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,076
Come on, scoop and move, buddy.

960
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,282
I am wanting you
to meet my fiance Pontangpu.

961
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,358
Damn. Glad to meet you.

962
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,119
She doesn't speak English.

963
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,754
It was, uh, nice to meet you.

964
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,505
I'm gonna have a baby.

965
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,273
Oh, yeah!

966
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,811
Oh, no.

967
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,336
The, uh, proctologist's wife says

968
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,707
"l guess we're just both
in love with assholes."

969
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,587
Oh, my God.

970
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,707
I'm in dire need of medical attention.

971
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:36,308
If you're catching a cold from being
in that outfit, maybe I can help you.

972
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,114
I don't need a pediatrician.

973
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,415
I'm a grown woman.

974
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,491
I need a real doctor.

975
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,596
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?

976
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,943
Well, what do you have to say now?

977
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,345
I'm not feeling so good.

978
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,888
Oh, my God.

979
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,448
How revolting, you bastard!

980
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,892
Oh, I see how you are.

981
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,395
You gave me the best
pelvic exam of my life,

982
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,661
and then you just walk away
like it means nothing.

983
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,360
God.

984
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,399
I hope there's a junkyard in hell.

985
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:38,406
I am proud to announce that
the newest member of our--

986
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,219
Of our medical staff, MD-63,

987
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,777
Of our medical staff, MD-63,

988
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,355
also known as RoboDoc,

989
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,187
has performed his
duties flawlessly in the trial period.

990
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,262
So, tomorrow, we will turn
his considerable talents

991
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,228
to those most in need.

992
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,799
Our children.

993
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,663
Tomorrow-- Please.

994
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,330
Tomorrow morning, RoboDoc
is scheduled to perform

995
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,342
the most ambitious surgical feat
in the history of medicine.

996
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:13,780
He will operate on and cure
all of the cross-eyed children.

997
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:18,513
The-- Ah, MD-63.

998
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,215
Would you care to share a few words?

999
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,489
Thank you...

1000
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:38,569
...all for coming.

1001
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,336
Coming.

1002
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:50,249
It's all right, everybody.
Everything's fine.

1003
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,980
Just, uh, stage fright.

1004
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,388
This hunk of junk had better be ready

1005
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:03,022
to perform delicate
eye surgery tomorrow morning.

1006
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:08,229
Or I'll be arranging
a special surgical procedure for you.

1007
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:11,738
And it won't be delicate.

1008
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,536
Ha. Thank you for joining us.

1009
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,634
We look forward to
seeing you tomorrow morning.

1010
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,928
How is he?

1011
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,158
Well, he's still touch and go.

1012
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,292
The synchronization chip is fried.

1013
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,664
I need to find a donor.

1014
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,362
Donor? What is it?

1015
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,497
Somebody who lends
something to somebody.

1016
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,768
But that's not important right now.

1017
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:52,245
I need a chip, you know, from a cell phone,
or a pager or a digital watch.

1018
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,442
Here. Here. Take my beeper
I don't want it anyway.

1019
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:58,281
Thanks, but I know I'm
gonna need more chips.

1020
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,652
I need to find a match.
It's his only chance.

1021
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,315
Let's give him everything we got.

1022
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,222
Come on.

1023
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,498
I'm going back in.

1024
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,569
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1025
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:32,577
Wake up, everyone.

1026
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:35,418
- Hey.
- You made it!

1027
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,491
Look at that. Everything working?

1028
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:37,991
Yes, and guess what.

1029
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,720
I didn't need any of
the cell phones or pagers.

1030
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:44,356
The matching chip came
from Dr. Mills' watch.

1031
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,458
Thank you, Lauren.

1032
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:48,900
You're welcome.

1033
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,631
Now let's go straighten
some crossed eyes.

1034
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,536
- Yes.
- All right.

1035
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,338
Uh, sorry.

1036
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,173
Didn't realize you were still on the charger.

1037
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:07,788
Big Jake, the sardine can
is on his way to surgery,

1038
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:13,192
and we are on our way to being filthy,
disgustingly stinky, outrageously rich.

1039
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:55,967
Uh, give me a nice,
clean sterile surgery here, okay?

1040
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,471
You hear the bell, you start cutting.

1041
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,754
What the hell is this?

1042
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:24,165
"Cut the optic nerve?"

1043
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:25,528
Oh, God.

1044
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:28,125
Oh, my G-- I gotta stop him.

1045
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:42,917
I am done.

1046
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,024
It's dark in here.

1047
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,686
Just a minute.
I'm taking the bandage off now.

1048
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,662
They're straight. You did it!

1049
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,001
Are you gonna take the bandages off?

1050
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,078
Everyone back!

1051
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,856
Look, he's blind!

1052
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,596
Oh, look!

1053
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,360
All the children are blind!
They're all blind!

1054
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,630
I'm calling a lawyer.

1055
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,066
Jake Gorman. Attorney-at-law.

1056
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,437
You called?

1057
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,840
This guy's like a toilet,

1058
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,674
always around when shit goes down.

1059
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,407
I'm calling Risk Management.

1060
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,416
I'm calling the police.

1061
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,918
But the blindness is just temporary.

1062
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,955
Tell it to the judge.

1063
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:33,359
Marcus, we're gonna have more money
than you know what to do with.

1064
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,761
Oh, ha ha, I know what to do with it.

1065
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:39,527
I'm going to see the world.

1066
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:46,063
Yeah. It's just a shame that
the poor little blind children

1067
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,574
won't be able to see the world.

1068
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,075
Ha! Just kidding!

1069
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,922
Please state your name.

1070
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,260
MD-63.

1071
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,994
But most people call me RoboDoc.

1072
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,272
Does the MD mean that
you're a medical doctor?

1073
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:21,035
No. It stands for medical device.

1074
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:24,078
You're not just any medical device.

1075
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,342
In fact, you're a highly advanced robot

1076
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:32,716
whose database contains all of mankind's
medical and surgical knowledge.

1077
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,813
So when you performed surgery
on these children,

1078
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,052
you've simply
followed your programming,

1079
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,062
and performed the procedure
exactly as specified.

1080
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:44,257
No.

1081
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,095
No?

1082
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,266
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1083
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,143
MD-63.

1084
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:07,881
Why do people call you RoboDoc?

1085
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,151
Because I perform the functions of a doctor.

1086
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:15,992
You perform the functions of a doctor.

1087
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:19,761
What other functions do you perform?

1088
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,768
I do not understand your question.

1089
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,997
For instance, do you make coffee?

1090
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,130
Yes.

1091
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,298
- Do you toast bread?
- Yes.

1092
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,000
- Open cans.
- Yes.

1093
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:32,843
So you're a coffee maker, toaster,
and can opener,

1094
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,940
that also happens
to be a doctor and an eye surgeon?

1095
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,684
Yes.

1096
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,915
Where did you go to medical school?

1097
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,457
I did not.

1098
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,458
- High school?
- No.

1099
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,825
The fact is that you perform
the work of a doctor,

1100
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:53,765
and you didn't even graduate
from kindergarten. Is that correct?

1101
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,997
You are not qualified
to operate on the eyes of a child.

1102
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:01,269
I wouldn't even
let you touch the eyes of a potato.

1103
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,182
State your name.

1104
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,685
Dr. William Von Schmekel.

1105
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:18,192
Dr. Von Schmekel,
you developed the surgical technique

1106
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,783
used by the defendant?

1107
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:23,193
Ja, and I heard it worked perfectly.

1108
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,493
Doctor, these children are blind.

1109
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,366
Ja, but their eyes are straight.

1110
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:33,373
But does your procedure
usually cause blindness?

1111
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,840
How should I know?

1112
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:39,004
I only did the procedure on rats and mice.

1113
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,375
You see this little fellow?

1114
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,213
He used to be cross-eyed.

1115
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,755
Yes, doctor, we can
all see that his eyes are straight.

1116
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:50,654
But has this rodent
been blinded by your procedure?

1117
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,954
How should I know?

1118
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,461
I speak German, and I speak English,

1119
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,532
but I don't speak rat.

1120
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:01,124
Perhaps you should ask him.

1121
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:10,036
You shut your filthy,
stinking little lying rat hole!

1122
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,474
Mr. Gorman!

1123
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,610
I mean, sorry.

1124
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,450
He is a menace.

1125
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,925
When I think of the tears being shed

1126
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:32,432
by those...poor defenseless, innocent...

1127
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:35,935
prepubescent...

1128
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:40,064
beautiful little children--

1129
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:49,413
He forced me into the supply closet,

1130
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,952
and he touched me like no other

1131
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:55,352
battery-operated device
has ever touched me before.

1132
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,853
Look what he did to me!

1133
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:01,986
He took out my appendix,

1134
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:06,500
and left this ugly, hideous scar.

1135
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,207
I didn't do the mime.

1136
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,285
Hey, shut up!

1137
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:27,549
Quiet! You're not the one on trial here.

1138
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,453
Yet.

1139
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:49,876
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1140
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,139
We have, your honor.

1141
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:55,876
We, the jury, find the defendant

1142
01:20:55,984 --> 01:21:00,478
MD-63 guilty.

1143
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:07,259
And we recommend
that he be disassembled

1144
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,354
and recycled for parts.

1145
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:15,232
We further order that RlP Healthcare

1146
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:20,502
pay the plaintiffs $3,577 trillion

1147
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,873
and 37 cents.

1148
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:26,937
And how did you arrive at that figure?

1149
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:30,381
It's all the money in the world, judge.

1150
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:34,421
Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.

1151
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,825
RoboDoc, rise.

1152
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,567
MD-63, you are hereby sentenced

1153
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:55,609
to incarceration at Big Bernie's
Auto Wreckers and Salvage yard

1154
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,076
until the day of your demolition,

1155
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:01,945
when you will be crushed down
to the size of a soda can,

1156
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,213
and may God have mercy
on your mainframe.

1157
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:13,523
We lost how much?

1158
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,096
That's imposs--

1159
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,071
So many patients, no doctors.

1160
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:27,573
Thank you for coming in to help.

1161
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:31,237
No problem, it's good to be back.

1162
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,644
You, you, you, you--

1163
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,315
Sorry.

1164
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,560
I cannot believe
they're going to recycle me.

1165
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,857
I'm going to miss you guys.

1166
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:24,795
Well, you can see me twice a week,

1167
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,459
if they turn you into a set of golf clubs.

1168
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,773
Come on, guys.

1169
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:37,242
You know, we can't let them do this.

1170
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:38,676
We can break him out of here.

1171
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,146
You know, how big can Big Barnie be?

1172
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,410
You know, I'm not afraid of him.

1173
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:51,520
Listen, Robo... Doc.

1174
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:54,288
I know you and I got started
on the wrong foot,

1175
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,229
but it was nothing personal.

1176
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,424
It's just that over the years,

1177
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:02,230
I've seen so many computers
and machines brought into the hospital.

1178
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:06,205
It was like they were becoming
more important than the patients.

1179
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:11,301
So I'm the last one you would ever think
would support the idea of a robot doctor,

1180
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,711
but-- Wait. Wait. Wait.

1181
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,306
You big-- You big--

1182
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:20,716
You've changed my mind,
you've opened my eyes.

1183
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,382
You've shown a level
of expertise and efficiency

1184
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,425
that most doctors can only dream about.

1185
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:29,395
You've treated your patients
with kindness, with dignity.

1186
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,466
You've been an inspiration to all of us
to become better doctors,

1187
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,228
better people.

1188
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,701
You've become a friend.

1189
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:40,571
You've got the heart of a man,
you've got the soul of a man.

1190
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,643
And you're taking this like a man.

1191
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:50,575
My oil plug. It must've popped out.

1192
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,519
It's time.

1193
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,072
What's this word?

1194
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:20,279
Blind.

1195
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:23,441
"Three blind mice.

1196
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:26,452
See how they run."

1197
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:29,352
You can see?

1198
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,358
You can all see.

1199
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:38,694
Let's go save RoboDoc!

1200
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:44,166
Excuse me!
We need to get to the junkyard fast!

1201
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:22,341
Let's get a move on, RoboCrock.

1202
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:23,842
The only thing that's gonna save
your oily ass now

1203
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,378
is a phone call from the governor.

1204
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,708
Oh, hold on a second.

1205
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,907
Let me take this call.

1206
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,315
Hello, Big Bernie's Auto--

1207
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,512
It's the governor!

1208
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,590
Yes, sir, Mr. Governor.
Big Bernie here.

1209
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,659
No, sir, you're right on time.

1210
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,523
We hadn't even started yet.

1211
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,391
Yes, sir, I'll take care of it personally.

1212
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:43,725
You bet, sir. Thanks for calling.

1213
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,860
Hey, Mike, don't crush that car yet.

1214
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:52,735
The governor wants the hood off of it.

1215
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,740
Come on!

1216
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:58,334
Let's get a move on.

1217
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:20,299
Stop! The kids can see!
They can see!

1218
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,869
That's ridiculous.
These kids can't see.

1219
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,531
Their optic nerves were cut.

1220
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,039
- Hey, how'd you know--
- I didn't.

1221
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,608
- You did it.
- No, I didn't.

1222
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,768
- You altered the article.
- Never!

1223
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:32,277
I did not cut their optic nerves.

1224
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,780
I may be a robot,
but I am not stupid.

1225
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,975
The blindness was temporary
from normal swelling

1226
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,313
after the operation.

1227
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,046
You're all lying!

1228
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:42,918
This is just a desperate last-minute stunt.

1229
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,389
These kids can't see.

1230
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,756
It'll cost me too much money.

1231
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:50,319
Sweet, unfortunate, blind little boy,

1232
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,558
if you can see my face,

1233
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:53,895
what do I look like?

1234
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:56,869
A rat bastard.

1235
01:27:56,971 --> 01:28:01,965
Doctor, you're under arrest
for falsifying a medical journal...

1236
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:03,043
I did not.

1237
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,839
...endangering
the eyesight of little children,

1238
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,846
and product tampering.

1239
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,040
Product tampering?

1240
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:09,548
Take him away.

1241
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:12,381
RoboDoc, in light of this new evidence,

1242
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:15,081
I hereby exonerate you of any wrongdoing.

1243
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,157
You're a free man-- er, robot.

1244
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:19,283
Whatever you are, you're free.

1245
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:20,793
Release the prisoner.

1246
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:55,054
Oh, RoboDoc,
I knew you were innocent all along.

1247
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,631
I'm so happy to have you back.

1248
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:04,329
So what do you think now?

1249
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:16,909
I think I need to make
an emergency phone call

1250
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,781
to the Centers for Disease Control.

1251
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,877
Excuse me.

1252
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:28,690
Your cat scan looks perfectly
normal, Mr. Gorman,

1253
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,730
but we don't like to take any chances,

1254
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:32,959
so we will be removing
the top of your head.

1255
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:36,298
Just to go in and take a look
around, to be sure.

1256
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,929
No! No!

1257
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,029
No!

1258
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,701
Yes, yes, yes.

1259
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:47,474
Fortunately, we do have the finest brain
surgeon in town to do the operation.

1260
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,675
I believe you've meet Dr. Sosumi.

1261
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:08,732
Mr. Gorman not going to be able
to sue any more doctors.

1262
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:12,795
He going to have to find new line of work.

1263
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:47,901
Now say ah.

1264
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:27,342
