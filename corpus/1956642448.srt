1
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,042
(gentle music)

2
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,881
- Stephanie?
(sirens wailing)

3
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:54,172
- [Woman] She's bleeding.

4
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:56,923
- [Man] Does anyone have
a jacket or a blanket?

5
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,756
- [Woman] Is she okay?

6
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,714
- [Woman] Oh, my God.

7
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,256
- You're okay.

8
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,464
- Tamp it.
- Her name is Stephanie Daley.

9
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,673
- [Woman] Ma'am, calm
down, it's all right.

10
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,714
It's all right.

11
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:13,839
- Where is it?

12
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,006
Where's the baby?

13
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:15,839
(crying)

14
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,756
- [Man] Mrs. Daley, please.

15
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:21,339
- Oh Stephanie, oh Stephanie.

16
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:22,339
Oh, my baby.

17
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,089
We're gonna see her, okay?

18
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,214
- [Man] Just keep
your head down.

19
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,381
- Mr. and Mrs. Daley
is it true that--

20
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:36,965
(reporters chattering
over each other)

21
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,297
- [Joe] I don't know.

22
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:02,881
- [Miri] What are they
doing at the house?

23
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,673
- [Joe] Look, just stay in
the car, I'll get rid of 'em.

24
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,422
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, you need to,

25
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:17,006
you have to get back,
you have to get back.

26
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,631
This is private property.

27
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,339
This is private
property, come on.

28
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,422
- [Miri] The police took things.

29
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,089
- Where's the door?

30
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,714
- [Miri] The doctor said
we should take it off

31
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,923
so we can make sure you
don't hurt yourself.

32
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:50,006
(heartbeat pounding)

33
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:10,214
(gasps)

34
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:11,923
- Oh, there's a kick.

35
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:13,089
- He's always kicking.

36
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:19,339
- Three pounds, 10 ounces,
29 weeks, three days.

37
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,756
Not bad, young lady.

38
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:23,506
- Hey.
- Hey.

39
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,339
- Sorry I'm late.

40
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,422
- Look, look.

41
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:31,923
- [Doctor] May I ask why you
decided to change doctors?

42
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,172
- Well--
- well, you were recommended

43
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:37,506
to us as someone who specialized
in high risk pregnancies.

44
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:39,172
- I don't consider
you high risk.

45
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:42,881
- Well our previous
doctor did not betray

46
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,506
a lot of confidence and
was always talking about

47
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:48,130
Lydie's age like she had
done something wrong.

48
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,839
- I have delivered many
women older than you.

49
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:55,631
I would say your health is
more of a factor at this point.

50
00:04:55,631 --> 00:05:00,506
You conceived three, just three
months after a stillbirth.

51
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:02,506
That's remarkable.

52
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,006
- Well I'm healthy.

53
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:05,839
- Mm hmm.

54
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:11,339
No, I just, would you admit
it if you didn't feel fine?

55
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,756
- What's that supposed to mean?

56
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,256
- Nothing, nothing.

57
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:15,214
You wanna grab lunch?

58
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,839
- I'd love to but I have
to stop by the office.

59
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,798
I'll see you later.

60
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:26,381
(light music)

61
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,589
- Jack.

62
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,006
- Lydie.

63
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:55,839
Good to see you.

64
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,548
You look wonderful,
when are you due?

65
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:02,881
- Oh no one asks what I
do anymore, just when.

66
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,756
- I already know what you do.

67
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:05,589
That's why I'm here.

68
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,881
- [Lydie] Come in.

69
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,923
- [Jack] You think Paul's
up for diaper duty?

70
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:11,464
- [Lydie] We're gonna
find out soon.

71
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:17,798
- Hey, scheduled another
competency hearing for next
week.

72
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,464
They're just aging the case,
but what are you gonna do?

73
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:28,464
I had Jacobsen on it, but
some kind of conflict.

74
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,714
- What about a plea bargain?

75
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:35,256
- There's one on the table,
but the parents won't touch it.

76
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,006
They wanna clear
their little girl.

77
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,047
- Medical examiner
estimates 26 weeks.

78
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:46,172
I'm at 29 weeks, by the way.

79
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,548
- [Jack] That's not a bad thing.

80
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:50,089
- Is it a good thing?

81
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,839
- You're a good thing.

82
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,839
- [Lydie] Thank you.

83
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,006
- She claims she didn't
know she was pregnant.

84
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,256
Claims that the
infant was stillborn.

85
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:05,756
Used her teeth to cut the cord.

86
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,714
- Air in the lungs?

87
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:12,631
- And bowels, also toilet
paper embedded in the face.

88
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:16,339
- And the father a
marine 19 years old.

89
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,089
- Claims he was unaware
both that she was a minor

90
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,381
and that she was pregnant.

91
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,297
Parents, teachers,
classmates, all clueless.

92
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:28,589
Thought she was gaining
a little weight.

93
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,006
- Abdominal muscles at
that age are very tight.

94
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,548
You think she knew?

95
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:41,172
- [Jack] That's what I
want you to find out.

96
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,756
- I'm asking you what you think.

97
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,506
- If this is cutting
too close to your leave

98
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:48,756
I can call Levenson.

99
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:51,756
- I'll call Levenson.

100
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,714
Mr. Daley, Stephanie,
Mrs. Daley.

101
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:00,589
I'm Lydie Crane, I'm
sorry to keep you waiting.

102
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:01,422
Come on in.

103
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:10,006
So I am a forensic psychologist

104
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,256
and as you probably know
I have been hired by the

105
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:16,006
prosecutors office to
provide an evaluation for the

106
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,923
competency hearing next week.

107
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,006
And should your case
move to trial--

108
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,714
- We're not taking
a plea bargain.

109
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,172
- Should your case move to
trial I would very likely be

110
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,881
called as a witness.

111
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:32,297
I also need to tell you that
anything you talk to me about

112
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:35,756
in that it may be relevant to
the case, could be considered

113
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:38,714
evidence and used
against you in court.

114
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:39,714
Do you understand?

115
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,464
- We have nothing to hide.

116
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:42,297
- Stephanie?

117
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:46,756
Good news is that I have
your test results here,

118
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,631
so I won't be asking
you to do those again.

119
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:49,839
We'll just be talking.

120
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:54,172
At anytime you like to speak
with your parents or talk

121
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:58,506
privately with your
lawyer that's fine, okay?

122
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,422
Watch out, that's very hot.

123
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:13,548
Take it by the handle, okay?

124
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:27,089
Okay, do you wanna
ask any questions?

125
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:30,089
- They hire you 'cause
you're pregnant?

126
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:34,631
- Actually, I was hired because
I handled a similar case for

127
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:36,422
the prosecutor two years ago.

128
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,256
- What happened?

129
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:41,464
- 17 year old buried
her infant alive.

130
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:43,839
- I didn't kill it.

131
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:45,923
- I didn't say you did.

132
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:48,172
- I already told the police
and the doctors everything.

133
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,589
- Well, I'm not the doctors
and I'm not the police.

134
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:52,464
- You work for the police.

135
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:55,089
- No, I work for the
prosecutor, that's different.

136
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,965
Do you understand
the difference?

137
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,756
I was hired to make an
unbiased evaluation.

138
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,256
If I don't, your lawyer
will take me apart,

139
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,673
you can trust me on that.

140
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:15,798
So, why don't we start by you
telling me about last summer.

141
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,589
- It was just a regular summer.

142
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:26,548
(birds chirping)

143
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:40,172
(flute music)

144
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,548
- [Joe] Steph, let's go.

145
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:07,339
- And I'm gonna go see
your mom after church.

146
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,130
- [Woman] Thank you.

147
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,965
- Richard.

148
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:11,464
- Hey, Joe, how are ya?

149
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,589
- Hi Terry.
- And you, Miri?

150
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,006
- Hi, Stephanie, how
are you sweety?

151
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,756
- [Terry] Looking
forward to seeing Steph

152
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:18,589
in AP English this fall.

153
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:19,881
- Oh, and drivers ed.

154
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,506
And driver's ed, dad.

155
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:22,548
- Not 'til the spring.

156
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,798
- You'll have to come
over and babysit sometime.

157
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:25,965
- Okay.

158
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,047
- You know, when your
mother was your age

159
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,130
she used to babysit for me.

160
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,422
Oh yeah, yeah, I was
nine years old.

161
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,548
I had a crush on her
the size of Nebraska.

162
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:33,506
- Submission.

163
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:37,965
It's not a very popular
subject these days.

164
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:40,673
Look around you.

165
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:45,965
Everything is teaching
you how to be a leader,

166
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,381
a trendsetter.

167
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:48,214
(baby whining)

168
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:52,589
It occurs to me that all this
talk is because we are trying

169
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:53,714
to replace God.

170
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,756
(baby crying)

171
00:11:56,756 --> 00:12:00,297
Follow God and you're a leader.

172
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,130
- You wanna go down?

173
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,965
Yeah?

174
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:10,631
(gasps) There.

175
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,130
There, yeah, yeah.

176
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,130
Oh, no, no, no.

177
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,506
No, no, no, no, no, no.

178
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:23,089
Come on, come on.

179
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,839
(baby screaming)

180
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,172
(door slamming)

181
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:46,256
- [Lydie] No, Ralphie,
no, no, no, no, no.

182
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:52,047
- Hey, honey.

183
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,214
- Paul.

184
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,047
(cat meows)

185
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,548
- Why does he do that anyway?

186
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:00,422
He's afraid of that thing.

187
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:02,631
- [Lydie] He just
wants the attention.

188
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:05,589
- Now I know you're
superstitious about buying
stuff,

189
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,172
but first of all I
thought it would match

190
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,798
your Jeep beautifully,
and it was on sale.

191
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:11,673
- Well, it's broken?

192
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:12,965
- What do you mean?

193
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:13,798
- Well, here.

194
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:18,756
- What is that, is that
an important part?

195
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,339
- It's okay, I can exchange it.

196
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,965
(bugs chirping)

197
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:52,756
- [Miri] Can we sue?

198
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,214
- [Joe] Yeah, we'll sue.

199
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:57,214
We'll sue 'em.

200
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:59,130
We're not suing anyone.

201
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:04,130
- [Miri] Can't just
fire everyone.

202
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,172
- I'd fire me too
if I were them.

203
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:10,047
I deal with selling things.

204
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:13,422
Every single person
in three counties

205
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,006
has been reading about this.

206
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:18,006
- C E C F C G C E C.

207
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,673
(flute music)

208
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:22,714
(squeaking)

209
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,965
(laughing)

210
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:28,297
- That sounded good.

211
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,798
- I'm just trying.

212
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:31,965
(humming)

213
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:32,798
Okay, stop, shh.

214
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:34,214
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

215
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:37,130
- Ugh.
- What?

216
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:41,923
- [Rhana] Oh, come on,
that's totally cheating.

217
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,006
(giggling)

218
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,089
- Hey lard ass.

219
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:45,839
Put 'em on the scale.

220
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,673
- Oh, okay.

221
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,756
- [Stephanie] How
much do you weigh?

222
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:51,089
Oh, somebody needs a diet.

223
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:51,923
- Cutest little.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,673
I wanna wear the white skirt.

225
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,172
- [Stephanie] What,
the one with the--

226
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,006
- [Rhana] Oh, the one
with the ties on it

227
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:56,881
(talking over each other)

228
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,381
- [Stephanie] Wait, wait,
wait, this one's jinxed.

229
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:00,839
- Why?
- It just is.

230
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:06,214
- [Miri] Then you're
not wasting your space.

231
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,798
- [Stephanie] Hey, mom.

232
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:09,256
I'm gonna go sleep
over at Rhana's.

233
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:11,548
- Be good.

234
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,089
- Are you close
with your parents?

235
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,006
- Sure.

236
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,464
- They talk to you about sex?

237
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,839
- No, but my Mom tried to,

238
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,673
but I mean I knew
everything already, so.

239
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,172
- How?

240
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,172
- I dunno, TV I guess.

241
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,297
- [Lydie] They talk to
you about abortion?

242
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:44,965
- No, but I could never do that.

243
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:46,798
- Why not?

244
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:49,881
- Because it would be
like killing a baby.

245
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,130
- [Rhana] Hold still.

246
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,339
- I'm trying, it tickles.
- Hello?

247
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,381
Yes, Stephanie's here.

248
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:03,214
- That's my mom.

249
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:05,089
- Yeah, the girls are
watching a movie.

250
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,548
Would you like to
talk to Stephanie?

251
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:09,548
No, it's not a problem.

252
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:11,506
Bye.

253
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:12,548
- Your sister's cool.

254
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:13,881
- She wants the house to
herself tonight so she

255
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,673
and her boyfriend can fuck.

256
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:21,214
It must be weird
being an only child.

257
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,881
I bet that's why you're so shy.

258
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:25,714
- I am not.

259
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,214
I'm not shy.

260
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:28,089
- Around guys you are.

261
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,673
- Well, it's just that I
haven't' found one that I like
yet.

262
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:38,297
(upbeat music)

263
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:53,089
- Hey, Steph.

264
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,714
Oh, that isn't your shirt.

265
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,006
- Shut up, Brad.

266
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:58,297
- Jen and Rhana, what's up girl?

267
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,673
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

268
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,548
Oh, my God, Stephanie, you came.

269
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:05,464
- [Stephanie] Yeah, hi.

270
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,589
- Oh, I'm so glad you came.

271
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,422
- Hey Rhana, hey Steph.

272
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:11,881
Steph, nice top, you
can see a little belly.

273
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,422
- Oh, okay.

274
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:14,839
- There's Mickey.

275
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,756
Do I look okay?

276
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,089
- Duh, go ahead.
- Okay, bye.

277
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,172
(muffled chatter)

278
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,548
(tapping)

279
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:04,923
- [Girl] I really wanna go
to school for psychology.

280
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,589
- Can I see some ID?

281
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,089
- I don't--

282
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,839
- I'm fucking with
you, actually.

283
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,256
Okay, give me the beer.

284
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,172
No, you gotta tip it so you
don't get too much head.

285
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:29,714
- No such thing
as too much head.

286
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:31,506
- I knew you were
gonna say that Jeff,

287
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,589
'cause you're an asshole.

288
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:37,047
What's your name?

289
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,631
Shut up.

290
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:39,714
What's your name?

291
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,214
- Stephanie Daley.

292
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,714
- That's cool.

293
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:46,548
(muffled chatter)

294
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:38,548
- Hi kitty.

295
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:42,464
(cat meowing)

296
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,214
Hi.

297
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:49,256
Oh, hey.

298
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:52,297
Hi, look at you.

299
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:53,798
Can I pick you up?

300
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,714
Oh, my goodness.

301
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,631
Come, we'll sit on the floor.

302
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,297
Hey.

303
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,756
Aw, hi little kitty.

304
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,214
Listen to you purr.

305
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:21,881
- Hey.

306
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:22,798
- Hey, hey.

307
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,172
What?

308
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:31,589
- You up here all alone?

309
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,589
- Yeah, I'm just trying
to be by myself.

310
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:37,297
- Yeah, yeah I get that, yeah.

311
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:42,798
Those people
downstairs, you know,

312
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:44,256
they're just like a
bunch of fuckin' kids.

313
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:45,089
- Yeah.

314
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:45,923
- Yeah, sometimes I feel like

315
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,506
I'm like a babysitter sometimes.

316
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:58,756
- So, are you, are you a senior?

317
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,673
- No, I just graduated.

318
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:09,965
- So what college are you
gonna go to in the fall?

319
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,339
- Hm?

320
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,839
Oh, there he goes.

321
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:18,006
(giggling)

322
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:23,006
Is it like really cold in here?

323
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,923
Or is it really hot,
I can't even tell.

324
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,631
I'm sorry I.

325
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,714
- No, it's...

326
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,047
It's a cat hair.

327
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:40,047
- Oh yeah, you got
some right there.

328
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,172
Is that, can I?

329
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,006
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:48,965
Close your eyes.

331
00:21:50,214 --> 00:21:51,548
Close your eyes.

332
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:56,214
(giggling)

333
00:21:56,214 --> 00:22:00,214
(mumbles) Just close your eyes.

334
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,256
Close 'em.

335
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,714
Okay, now this one.

336
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:17,714
Now you have to do me, okay?

337
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:19,673
- Okay.
- Okay.

338
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,839
- Okay.
- Yeah?

339
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:25,506
- I just.

340
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:48,589
- Yeah?

341
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:51,130
Yeah?

342
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:01,631
Yeah?

343
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:14,923
Stephanie?
- Yeah.

344
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:16,422
Stephanie?
- Yeah.

345
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:18,589
(moaning)

346
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,798
(pounding)

347
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:26,798
- [Boy] Corey, let's go!

348
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,631
Now!

349
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:31,464
Come on!

350
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:33,548
Corey if you don't
open this door

351
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,214
I'm coming in Corey.

352
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:39,339
You're my guy.

353
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,631
- I didn't cum.
- Let's go!

354
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:52,923
- [Lydie] How'd you get home?

355
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,548
- Hitched.

356
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:57,464
- Were you scared?

357
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,464
- Nothing really ever
happens around here.

358
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:05,422
- Well something had
just happened to you.

359
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:09,756
- Yeah, but I didn't
think that it counted.

360
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:10,673
- Why not?

361
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:13,172
- I didn't think it counted
because he didn't cum.

362
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,256
- So you didn't tell anybody?

363
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:22,297
Not even Rhana?

364
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,714
And when your period was late?

365
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,381
- It was always late.

366
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,798
I mean, it was never
regular and I was on a diet.

367
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:33,756
I heard that could.

368
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:40,339
I heard that could make
you lose it for a while.

369
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:44,297
- And Corey?

370
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:49,506
- Never saw him again.

371
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,006
(horns honking)

372
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:13,339
- Hello?

373
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:17,089
There she is.

374
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:18,881
Oh, my darling.

375
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,339
Where's mommy?

376
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:22,006
Is she in here?

377
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,172
Here she is, there's
my big girl.

378
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:25,006
Hey baby.

379
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:29,631
- Hi, I'll make you
something to eat.

380
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:32,464
- I can't stay, a client
of Paul is having a party.

381
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,006
- But you remember
dinner on Thursday?

382
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:34,881
- Oh.

383
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,506
- No, I know you don't
want another shower,

384
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,673
but we have to
celebrate week 29.

385
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:39,839
Here, take this.

386
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,798
Put some cheese on it, jalapeno.

387
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:43,631
Right there.

388
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:46,673
- Paul is bringing Frank.

389
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:50,297
- Ah, is Frank still
desperate for a wife?

390
00:25:50,297 --> 00:25:51,631
- Are you still not interested?

391
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:53,089
- I already have a child.

392
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:59,464
- Did I tell you I'm
evaluating Stephanie Daley?

393
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:00,381
- The ski mom?

394
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:03,339
- Mm hm.
- Congratulations.

395
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:06,089
- Thanks, if you mean it.

396
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,297
- Oh, Jesus Christ you're
bleeding in the lasagna sweety.

397
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,673
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

398
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:12,506
- Oh wow.

399
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:13,923
- It's okay, it's nothing.

400
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:15,839
- [Lydie] But how could
I have not noticed that?

401
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,673
- I do not know.

402
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:18,673
- Oh, shit.

403
00:26:19,756 --> 00:26:20,798
- Here, hold this up.

404
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:25,381
Lydie, I'm not an
expert, but I don't think

405
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:27,006
anyone's ever brought
a kid into this world

406
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,756
without losing their
mind a little.

407
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,923
Do you want flowers
or a dinosaur?

408
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:34,714
- Dinosaur.

409
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:35,589
- Dinosaur it is.

410
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:40,256
It will be worth it, I promise.

411
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:45,464
- [Lydie] No, cat.

412
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:48,214
No, no you don't.

413
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,089
I'm so sorry (mumbles).

414
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,006
- I was getting worried.

415
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,589
- [Lydie] I stopped by Jamie's.

416
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:05,756
- I really, really do not
wanna go to this thing.

417
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:09,756
- Come on.

418
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,172
(muffled chatter)

419
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:22,506
- Hey, kids, I'm glad you
could finally make it.

420
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:23,673
- Roy.
- Good to see you, Paul.

421
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:24,506
- How you doing?

422
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:25,756
- This is Sharlene.
- Hello, how do you do?

423
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:26,881
- [Roy] Hi Lydie.

424
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:27,714
- I'd like you to
meet my wife, Lydie.

425
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:29,006
- How do you do?

426
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,798
Very pleased to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

427
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:32,714
- Oh, Paul, buy
one get one free.

428
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:35,589
(laughing)

429
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,006
I really love what your
husband did with this place.

430
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,714
Paul, can I see
you for a minute?

431
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:40,548
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.

432
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:41,381
- Sure.

433
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:45,631
- I really didn't
wanna go to this.

434
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

435
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,881
So, so, how are ya?

436
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,798
- I'm fantastic and I'm
30 pounds overweight,

437
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,923
but everyone keeps telling
me how great I look.

438
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:01,256
- You look totally hot.

439
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:02,673
- Totally hot.
- Totally.

440
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:05,297
- You know that I
have varicose veins.

441
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:06,172
- Really?
- Real ones.

442
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:07,631
(gasps)

443
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,839
- Can I see 'em?
- Yeah, you wanna?

444
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,673
- Whoa.

445
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,422
Whoa, whoa, do those hurt?

446
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:15,422
- Yeah, they do.

447
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:18,673
- Frank, over here.

448
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,798
- Oh, um, I gotta go.

449
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:23,839
- Yeah, go, go, go.

450
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,256
(chattering)

451
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:33,214
- You're Paul's wife?
- I am.

452
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:35,756
(laughing)

453
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,965
- Your talented husband must
be doing wonderful things

454
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:40,297
with the nursery.

455
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,923
- Well, actually we're waiting

456
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:43,798
till after the birth for that.

457
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:45,631
We have some things
picked out, but--

458
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:47,839
- Aw, don't be like that, honey.

459
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,089
Don't think cautiously, you
must have a ballsy vibe.

460
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:55,673
Otherwise, oh you're gonna
pass on all sorts of things

461
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:57,130
to your child.

462
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,339
I know, I know, I'm
doing regression myself.

463
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,047
- Oh, and what exactly
do you remember?

464
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,130
- Waves of panic,

465
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,839
my mother saying that I
was destroying her figure

466
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,381
and she didn't want me.

467
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,006
Her heart beating
above me in the dark.

468
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:27,172
- Excuse me.

469
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:31,006
(chattering)

470
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,256
Hey.

471
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,089
- [Frank] Hey.

472
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:01,965
- Seen Paul?

473
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:04,965
- No, but I'm sure
he'll come back.

474
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:07,422
- Paul always comes back.

475
00:30:09,256 --> 00:30:10,130
- You all right?

476
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,965
- Yeah.

477
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,839
- Why don't you step
into my office?

478
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,798
- Ah, thank you.

479
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:24,381
- I heard about the ski mom.

480
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,631
- News travels fast.

481
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:27,965
- Are those clip on?

482
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:29,172
- Yeah.

483
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:30,673
- Wow.

484
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:31,714
No holes.

485
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,006
- I'm afraid of needles.

486
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:36,965
- I got mine done
after my divorce.

487
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,464
At the mall.

488
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:39,464
- That's very brave.

489
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:50,589
I wish people would
stop smiling at me.

490
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:51,548
- Sorry.

491
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,006
Hey, that's one wish.

492
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:53,881
You got two more.

493
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,006
- I wish that I didn't have
to pee every two minutes.

494
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:05,214
And I wish I could have a drink.

495
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:08,589
- I can get you drunk
with my hands.

496
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:09,422
Come on.

497
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,339
Give me your hands.

498
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,297
Now close your eyes.

499
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:17,130
- What are you gonna do?

500
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,965
- Close 'em.

501
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:19,839
Both of them.

502
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,089
Don't cheat.

503
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:27,089
Now, visualize a bloody Mary.

504
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:30,464
Limes, olives, celery.

505
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:35,256
Tall, frothy, bloody Mary.

506
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,006
- Ah!

507
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:41,714
- Are you sliding yet?

508
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:46,714
- I am.

509
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,881
- You smell like Roy's scotch.

510
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:57,297
- You can smell that?

511
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,965
You have a nose of a bloodhound.

512
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:31,381
- Shit.

513
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:36,839
- My Dad took off last night.

514
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:40,130
- You know where he went?

515
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,548
- Denver, it's where
my uncle lives.

516
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:48,548
He's a hippie and
makes flatbread.

517
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:51,798
I don't even know exactly
what flatbread is but...

518
00:33:55,923 --> 00:33:58,089
My dad told my mom that
he needed a change.

519
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,214
I don't really blame him,
I mean I wouldn't really

520
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:04,839
wanna be around me
and my mom either.

521
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,673
- Why not?

522
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,673
What's wrong with you
and your mother?

523
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,506
- She thinks this is
all gonna go away.

524
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:14,006
That I'm just gonna
go back to school

525
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:17,006
and it's gonna be the way
that it's gonna be before.

526
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,589
(bell ringing)

527
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:23,589
- (mumbles) giving me like
this random phone call.

528
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,506
Oh Steph, hi.

529
00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:27,923
(chattering)

530
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:37,256
Oh my God, she's put
on like 20 pounds.

531
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,631
- Hi Steph.

532
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:43,673
- Hey.

533
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:49,839
- All right ladies
and gentleman.

534
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,798
It's that time.

535
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:53,756
How's everybody doing?

536
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:54,589
- [Class] Good.

537
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:55,422
- Good.

538
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,172
Jacob Brower.

539
00:34:58,172 --> 00:34:59,589
- [Jacob] Hey Mr. Thomas.

540
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:01,297
- Satan Carmichael.

541
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:05,130
- It's Satin, Satan
has an A at the end.

542
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:09,297
- Sue, Katie, one,
two, ready and--

543
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:12,464
(marching band music)

544
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:18,422
Left, left, left, left.

545
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,089
Play from the top.

546
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:49,798
- [Girl] I cannot
stand this class.

547
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,589
Oh my God, look at your boobs.

548
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:56,297
Wow.

549
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:01,006
(hollering)

550
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:12,464
- You're out!

551
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:15,756
- Hey Satan!

552
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:22,714
(laughing)

553
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:23,965
- Hey lard ass!

554
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,714
- You bitch.

555
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:31,464
You were already out!

556
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,673
- [Rhana] Ignore her,
just ignore her!

557
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:40,422
- Satin used to go to our
church when she was little.

558
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:44,006
She was a really
good friend of mine.

559
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,172
And then she got really weird.

560
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,673
And they're like, there
were all these rumors about

561
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:56,756
her having sex with
different guys.

562
00:36:57,756 --> 00:36:59,548
- Did you believe those rumors?

563
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:01,214
- I don't know.

564
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:03,464
Didn't really think about it.

565
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:07,548
It's just, stuff, stuff
people were saying.

566
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:11,464
I don't know, it
wasn't really real.

567
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:19,798
I think she kinda felt
like I dumped her.

568
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:22,172
- Like Corey dumped you?

569
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:25,881
And Rhana?

570
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:28,839
- Oh Rhana didn't really dump
me, she just got a boyfriend.

571
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,422
(bell ringing)

572
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:33,839
(chattering)

573
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,589
- Oh that's awesome.

574
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:45,339
- What are you doing?

575
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,172
Stop.

576
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:50,714
Are those diet pills?

577
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:54,089
Aren't there like
speed in those?

578
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:56,130
- No, I think they're herbal,
my mom gave them to me.

579
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,006
- Oh let me have one.

580
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,798
- All right everybody,
welcome to ski club.

581
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:02,089
(applause)

582
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:04,339
Mr. Jeffrey, welcome,
glad you could make it.

583
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:08,006
All right everybody, this
year's trip, second weekend

584
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,256
in January, mark it down,
put it in your calendar.

585
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:15,839
(hollering)
(cheering)

586
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:31,965
(marching band music)

587
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:48,756
(chattering)

588
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:52,006
- [Rhana] Oh come on
Steph, are you serious?

589
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:54,089
Would you really wanna
be one of those girls?

590
00:38:56,422 --> 00:38:57,381
Jeff's into you.

591
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:59,589
- I don't think so.

592
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:02,130
- You know what your problem is?

593
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,881
You don't believe in yourself.

594
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:06,965
You have to believe.

595
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:08,756
Believe.

596
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,130
- [Stephanie] Hey.

597
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:20,965
- Hey.

598
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:23,881
It's a cute uniform.

599
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:26,381
- [Stephanie] Oh yeah.

600
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:30,006
- I like the buttons.

601
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,297
- Have you talked to Corey?

602
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:40,673
- Corey, why would
I have seen Corey?

603
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,464
- I thought you
guys were friends.

604
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,381
- Well yeah, we
hung out sometimes,

605
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:49,839
but you know he's
kind of a jerk.

606
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:56,172
You heard he joined
the marines, right?

607
00:39:57,714 --> 00:40:00,297
He totally shaved his head.

608
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,339
Like a peach.

609
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,673
(chuckling)

610
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,089
Can I see this?

611
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:15,297
Do you wanna thumb wrestle?

612
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:16,381
- Sure, yeah.

613
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:19,714
- [Jeff] All right,
let's see this.

614
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:22,089
Pinchers, all right, one--

615
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,756
- [Both] One, two, three.

616
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,214
- Go, playin' possum?

617
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:29,589
Come on, come and get it.

618
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:32,589
(laughing)

619
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,589
Killer vice grip.

620
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,130
So are you going
to the ski trip?

621
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:50,464
- Dad?

622
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:01,381
- Steph?

623
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:04,464
It's awfully late, honey.

624
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:12,714
I know you're almost grown up

625
00:41:12,714 --> 00:41:16,506
but I do still wash
your sweaters.

626
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,798
- Lots of kids smoke at parties.

627
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:23,756
- Do you?

628
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:26,422
- No.

629
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:28,506
My mother didn't think
that I wanted to ski,

630
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:31,923
she thought I wanted to
hang out with my friends.

631
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:36,548
And then she told me about
how she used to be a pot head.

632
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:42,214
Look what that did for her.

633
00:41:42,214 --> 00:41:43,673
- How did that make you feel?

634
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,673
- I knew if I couldn't go,

635
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:52,422
I wouldn't get Jeff.

636
00:41:54,631 --> 00:41:57,297
And I'd never break the jinx.

637
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,172
- The jinx?

638
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:05,006
- Sounds like really silly
but ever since summer,

639
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:07,631
and sometimes it was
worse than others but...

640
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:16,631
Sometimes you can predict
which way it was gonna go,

641
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,673
you know, if you
watch for the signs.

642
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:20,965
- What sort of signs?

643
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:23,881
- Well, I mean it could be,

644
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,089
could be a fly on the wall.

645
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:36,006
The way somebody looks at you
or something that they said.

646
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:42,881
Has that ever happened to you?

647
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:43,714
- Sure.

648
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,631
But I know it's just
my brain working.

649
00:42:50,172 --> 00:42:53,631
You know, playing connect the
dots, whichever way it can.

650
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:01,047
(horns honking)

651
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:18,881
(phone ringing)

652
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:20,214
- [Paul] This is Paul, I
am unable to take your call

653
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:22,631
right now so leave a message.

654
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,172
- [Woman] Hello?

655
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,256
How are ya?

656
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,839
- Any dizziness or headache?

657
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:31,881
- [Lydie] No why?

658
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:33,422
Is something wrong?

659
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:35,839
- Well your blood
pressure's a little high.

660
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,339
It's probably nothing, but
I want you stop in here

661
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,006
again tomorrow, we don't
want to take any chances.

662
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:42,297
- [Lydie] Okay.

663
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:57,589
(cuff hissing)

664
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:42,089
- [Paul] Hi.

665
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:42,923
- Hey.

666
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,130
Cat box is broke.

667
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,006
- [Paul] Oh yeah?

668
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,839
- I'm not allowed to
handle cat feces.

669
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,006
- [Paul] Yeah, I know.

670
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:04,089
I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

671
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:06,006
- We have a birth
class tomorrow.

672
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,381
More of Roy's scotch?

673
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:28,297
- Oh well you know, I work
with Roy Gilcrest just to drink

674
00:45:28,297 --> 00:45:29,506
with Roy Gilcrest.

675
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:34,297
Yeah, I like what
we're doing though.

676
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:37,214
It's different, yeah,
different than we usually do,

677
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:38,923
you should come have a look.

678
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:40,631
- Yeah.

679
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:47,172
- How did it go with
the doctor today?

680
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,506
- Fine.

681
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:50,631
- Not what Jane says.

682
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:54,464
- What?

683
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:55,839
- [Paul] I called.

684
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,172
- It's nothing we can
do anything about.

685
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,881
Something we have to watch.

686
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:02,464
- Yeah, well if you stopped
working like you said

687
00:46:02,464 --> 00:46:03,339
you would.

688
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:06,506
- I can separate my work
from my personal life.

689
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:08,297
- Then what's it doing in bed?

690
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:15,923
- Look if you wanna
fix something,

691
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:17,798
can you fix the cat box?

692
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:22,006
- You want me to
fix the cat box?

693
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:22,881
- Yes.

694
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,130
- All right.

695
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:34,089
- You're gonna do it now?

696
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:36,923
- Yeah, I'll fix the cat box.

697
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:52,256
- The car wasn't starting so
I brought it into the garage.

698
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:54,965
Billed me $375 for it I
don't know how I'm gonna come

699
00:46:54,965 --> 00:46:56,006
up with that.

700
00:46:58,422 --> 00:47:01,006
Look the hearing is next
week, (mumbles) after that?

701
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:04,798
When are you coming home?

702
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:09,756
(mumbles)

703
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,006
Here's Stephanie.

704
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:19,297
- [Joe] Hey Steph!

705
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:25,381
You're so beautiful (mumbles).

706
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:46,297
- Oh is this your husband?

707
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:48,714
- Yeah.

708
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:49,548
- He's cute.

709
00:47:51,548 --> 00:47:53,214
Your hair looks different.

710
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:56,714
- Yeah, it's an old photo.

711
00:47:56,714 --> 00:47:58,548
I was pregnant last spring.

712
00:47:58,548 --> 00:47:59,756
- Oh, what happened?

713
00:47:59,756 --> 00:48:01,589
- Here come on, sit down.

714
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,006
- So, I saw you near the
drug store yesterday.

715
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:14,006
- Really, didn't see you.

716
00:48:14,006 --> 00:48:16,673
- Oh you were driving over
the bridge across the street.

717
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:18,339
- Oh I hate that intersection.

718
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:21,798
So the fact that you
saw me yesterday,

719
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:22,673
is that a sign?

720
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:26,339
- [Stephanie] What do you mean?

721
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,339
- What you were talking
about yesterday.

722
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:32,006
- Not really.

723
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:33,214
- No, why not?

724
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:37,714
I mean, what makes a sign.

725
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,673
- I don't know, I think
it just has to be

726
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:41,631
something specific.

727
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,464
- So give me an example.

728
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:48,839
- Well the eggs.

729
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:50,756
- [Teacher] So now that
you know what everything is

730
00:48:50,756 --> 00:48:53,214
and how to get pregnant,
let's talk about how not

731
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:54,422
to get pregnant.

732
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:56,464
Anyone?

733
00:48:57,714 --> 00:48:58,714
- Condom?

734
00:48:58,714 --> 00:48:59,548
- Sorry, Pratt.

735
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:03,006
I'd love to say you're
right, but according to the

736
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,464
school board, the only
way to be a 100% certain

737
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:10,047
you won't get pregnant
is abstinence.

738
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,589
That's the only way.

739
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:16,506
To be 100% certain you
won't get pregnant.

740
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,965
All right, let's move
on to parenthood.

741
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:25,673
This is a beeper baby.

742
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:28,381
The beeper says feed
me, change my diaper,

743
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:30,381
whatever, you press
the button here.

744
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:33,798
Everything's cool, healthy baby.

745
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:38,464
So, all of you in the aisle
will get a beeper baby.

746
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:41,089
And everyone else will get
a slightly less exciting.

747
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,006
Beeper egg.

748
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:49,464
(baby dolls beeping)

749
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,756
- Fuck off.

750
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:58,631
- You're walking up a hill,
we all know about hills here.

751
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:00,965
Your load is heavy.

752
00:50:02,548 --> 00:50:04,464
Where is your comfort?

753
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:06,089
Where is your staff?

754
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:08,965
Do you find it in drugs?

755
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,548
Or alcohol?

756
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:13,798
Maybe it's your job.

757
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:16,839
Or the internet.

758
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:17,839
- Did you say something
to her about us?

759
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,673
- These things may seem as
if they're going to make

760
00:50:20,673 --> 00:50:24,256
your life easier, but
what do they really do?

761
00:50:24,256 --> 00:50:25,631
- Bull shit you didn't.

762
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,798
- At the end of the day,
they make our loads heavier.

763
00:50:30,506 --> 00:50:31,381
Where do we turn?

764
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:34,214
What do we do?

765
00:50:36,006 --> 00:50:37,214
You give it to God.

766
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:38,881
- [Joe] You didn't say anything?

767
00:50:38,881 --> 00:50:40,297
- [Miri] Say anything
to who, what are you

768
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:41,381
talking about, Joe?

769
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:42,923
- [Joe] What she just
put that in her sermon?

770
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:44,297
- [Miri] You think I'm telling
the preacher what to say

771
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:45,923
in the service?

772
00:50:45,923 --> 00:50:48,673
The universe does not
revolve around you.

773
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:50,006
- [Joe] Fill it up.

774
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,506
Do you have cigarettes here?

775
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:57,506
- Joe no.

776
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:02,464
(egg beeping)

777
00:51:02,464 --> 00:51:05,714
What's that?

778
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:06,714
- It's just an egg,
supposed to show you how

779
00:51:06,714 --> 00:51:07,673
to have a baby.

780
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:13,673
(thunder booming)

781
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:16,006
- No man for any considerable
period can wear one

782
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,006
face to himself and
another to the multitude,

783
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:22,756
without finally getting
bewildered, as to which may be
true.

784
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:26,464
(baby dolls beeping)

785
00:51:26,464 --> 00:51:29,422
Okay, anybody with a
baby doll or an egg,

786
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:34,172
do whatever you have to do,
but please make them be quiet.

787
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:39,881
Thank you.

788
00:51:39,881 --> 00:51:42,464
All right, talking about
the Scarlet Letter here.

789
00:51:42,464 --> 00:51:44,714
Anybody wanna tell me
the point of this book?

790
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:49,714
Stephanie?

791
00:51:49,714 --> 00:51:53,297
- I think the point of
the book is to show that

792
00:51:53,297 --> 00:51:57,089
it's harder to live a lie
than it is to tell the

793
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:58,798
truth and be punished.

794
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:00,172
- That's good, Steph, good.

795
00:52:01,381 --> 00:52:03,839
Anybody think this story
has any relevance today?

796
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:07,589
Satin?

797
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:08,798
- I think it's bullshit.

798
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:13,714
- Okay.

799
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,965
Maybe you could
be more specific.

800
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:19,006
- He writes about this
hypocritical priest guy.

801
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:20,881
Who trashes this woman's
life and we're supposed to

802
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:23,381
feel sorry for him because
he's ruined his relationship

803
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:25,214
to God.

804
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:28,089
- And you don't think
a relationship with God

805
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:29,172
is an important thing?

806
00:52:36,214 --> 00:52:38,548
You know what great
literature is about, Satin?

807
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:43,714
It's about man and God.

808
00:52:45,214 --> 00:52:47,214
Nothing else really matters.

809
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,464
(bell ringing)

810
00:53:04,673 --> 00:53:06,839
(sobbing)

811
00:53:10,297 --> 00:53:14,464
- Come here, come here.

812
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:15,297
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:17,923
- You're not sorry.

814
00:53:19,339 --> 00:53:21,339
You're such a fucking sheep.

815
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:30,464
- All right everyone, hello.

816
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:32,172
The moment you've all
been waiting for.

817
00:53:32,172 --> 00:53:34,881
I'm collecting eggs and babies.

818
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,381
Cheryl.

819
00:53:38,923 --> 00:53:40,422
Jeff.

820
00:53:45,673 --> 00:53:46,714
Stephanie.

821
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:51,422
Stephanie?

822
00:53:51,422 --> 00:53:52,589
- Huh?

823
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:54,089
- Stephanie, where's your egg?

824
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:00,839
- I don't know.

825
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:01,673
- You don't know?

826
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:03,172
What does that mean?

827
00:54:03,172 --> 00:54:04,130
Is it hiding?

828
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:07,506
- I lost it.

829
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:11,631
- Stephanie.

830
00:54:14,714 --> 00:54:16,256
Did you know you were pregnant?

831
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,172
- No.

832
00:54:20,172 --> 00:54:21,214
- Stephanie.

833
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:22,172
- No.

834
00:54:22,172 --> 00:54:23,631
- Did you think you might be?

835
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:28,756
- I thought it was a test.

836
00:54:28,756 --> 00:54:29,756
- A test of what?

837
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:32,006
- I was weak.

838
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:35,798
God knew it.

839
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:37,089
- God knew it?

840
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:37,923
- I was weak.

841
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:41,130
- Negotiating with
God is one thing.

842
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,214
Blaming God is another.

843
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:48,172
You were the one with a choice,
you could have found out.

844
00:54:48,172 --> 00:54:50,130
- I thought I was
being punished.

845
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:57,965
- Last year, I lost a
little girl at 23 weeks.

846
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,589
They found out her heart
had stopped beating,

847
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,297
they induced labor, it
took six and half hours to

848
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:05,798
deliver her, she came out
looking like her father.

849
00:55:08,297 --> 00:55:09,965
What was I being punished for?

850
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:13,381
- You tell me.

851
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:21,798
- [Man] And what we need to
know is, is this a form of

852
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:23,006
legal insanity or not?

853
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:26,881
- Well once we establish
that she (mumbles)

854
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:28,923
the possibility of
pregnancy then we can argue

855
00:55:29,798 --> 00:55:31,839
that she had not only the
responsibility to examine

856
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,714
that possibility but also
the resources to do so.

857
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,673
- [Man] You're saying she
wasn't in real denial?

858
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:40,297
- No, I'm saying that I
don't believe her denial

859
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:43,464
was pathological, I
believe it was a choice.

860
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:45,798
- So now that we're all
comfortable, let's work on our

861
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:49,130
breathing exercises to
help with relaxation.

862
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,965
Partners you can do this
as well, so let's start

863
00:55:50,965 --> 00:55:54,548
with some deep long,
deep breaths.

864
00:55:54,548 --> 00:55:56,172
Good.

865
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:57,006
- Hey.

866
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:00,297
Oh, Paul couldn't make it.

867
00:56:00,297 --> 00:56:01,130
- [Labor Coach] Now
we're gonna work on

868
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,839
some panting exercises.

869
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:04,089
Let's take a deep breath.

870
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:05,798
(mumbles)

871
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:06,631
- What?

872
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:13,339
- [Lydie] I can't
believe he sent you!

873
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:14,172
- I know, I know, it's
a client meltdown,

874
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:15,589
you know Paul is the
one they trust.

875
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,631
- These classes are
ridiculous, it's not even,

876
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:18,381
I'm mean we've done them
before, but even if we didn't,

877
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:20,631
they're just a way of
keeping me busy so you think

878
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:21,464
you're getting ready.

879
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:23,464
- What you're not ready?

880
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:24,881
- Is Paul seeing someone?

881
00:56:26,673 --> 00:56:28,006
- [Frank] I'm sorry, what?

882
00:56:28,006 --> 00:56:29,339
- Is that why you're here?

883
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:33,422
- What are you talking about?

884
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:44,256
- I found this in the cat box.

885
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:47,631
- Well.

886
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:51,464
Did you talk to the cat?

887
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:55,089
Okay, I'm kidding, I'm sorry.

888
00:56:57,339 --> 00:56:58,381
Did you talk to Paul?

889
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:02,881
- Something's wrong.

890
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:06,214
Like last time.

891
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,297
- You mean physically.

892
00:57:09,422 --> 00:57:10,256
- No.

893
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:13,798
It's just...

894
00:57:15,923 --> 00:57:17,965
It's just a feeling.

895
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:22,506
Like when you know it's gonna
rain and you're not sure when.

896
00:57:28,506 --> 00:57:31,089
- Do you know something?

897
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:34,631
Last time, wasn't your fault.

898
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:42,130
- Then who's fault was it?

899
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:47,339
- Sometimes things just happen.

900
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:53,839
(chuckling)

901
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:19,464
Look.

902
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:26,464
- Give me a hand?

903
00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:27,548
- [Frank] Oh.

904
00:59:26,172 --> 00:59:29,756
- I'd like to thank God for
the position I'm in right now.

905
00:59:29,756 --> 00:59:31,548
- [Announcer] Make no down
payment, no monthly payment--

906
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:35,047
(water swooshing)

907
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:37,464
(chattering)

908
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:45,464
- [Reporter] 19 year old Corey
White (mumbles) office today.

909
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:48,172
White is accused of
statutory rape in connection

910
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,548
with the ski mom case.

911
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:52,006
- Private White is doing
everything to cooperate

912
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,798
(mumbles) investigation.

913
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,506
We expect a fair and
timely resolution.

914
00:59:55,506 --> 00:59:58,256
(birds chirping)

915
01:00:12,297 --> 01:00:14,881
(somber music)

916
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:30,130
(phone ringing)

917
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:34,881
- [Lydie] Morning Jack.

918
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,881
- [Jack] I wanna talk
to you about Corey.

919
01:00:40,714 --> 01:00:43,214
- I spoke to the prosecutor's
office this morning.

920
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:49,589
Corey said that you went to
see him before Christmas.

921
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:54,339
Why did you go and
see him, Steph?

922
01:00:57,089 --> 01:01:01,381
(chattering)
(giggling)

923
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:02,381
- You put it on.

924
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:04,548
- You put it on honey.

925
01:01:04,548 --> 01:01:06,965
(chattering)

926
01:01:21,172 --> 01:01:22,006
Who's that boy?

927
01:01:24,256 --> 01:01:25,756
- He's just a guy.

928
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,673
(gentle music)

929
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:53,881
(cat meowing)

930
01:02:30,006 --> 01:02:32,172
(gasping)

931
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,631
(dog whining)

932
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,631
(dog barking)

933
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:10,422
- Hey!

934
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:43,589
- Stephanie?

935
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,923
What are you doing?

936
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:01,714
- I heard something outside.

937
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:08,798
I thought it was a deer,
I thought it was hurt.

938
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:12,089
- Oh, oh Steph.

939
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:17,089
Steph.

940
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:21,381
Come on.

941
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:24,756
Let's go see if it's
still out there.

942
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:30,673
It's gone now.

943
01:04:34,339 --> 01:04:38,006
Steph, you're not a
little girl anymore.

944
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:42,923
Still it's crazy thinking
about you growing up.

945
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,297
Taking risks.

946
01:04:53,047 --> 01:04:55,214
I hope it's not too
late for that ski trip.

947
01:05:06,256 --> 01:05:08,130
Don't break your
leg or anything.

948
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:12,548
("Carol of the Bells")

949
01:06:13,339 --> 01:06:14,172
- Come on!

950
01:06:40,089 --> 01:06:42,256
(moaning)

951
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:37,965
(upbeat music)

952
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,714
(rock music drowns out lyrics)

953
01:08:27,256 --> 01:08:29,673
(chattering)

954
01:09:22,965 --> 01:09:25,130
(gasping)

955
01:09:43,381 --> 01:09:45,798
(whimpering)

956
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,839
(upbeat music)

957
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:52,006
(sobbing)

958
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,506
- Did you think about
getting any help?

959
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:41,673
- No.

960
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:43,006
- No, it didn't occur to you?

961
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:44,548
Or no you didn't want any help?

962
01:11:45,839 --> 01:11:48,089
- Both, I already knew
she was gonna be dead.

963
01:11:49,714 --> 01:11:51,548
- How did you know that?

964
01:11:51,548 --> 01:11:52,673
- I just know.

965
01:11:52,673 --> 01:11:56,006
- Did you check for a pulse?

966
01:11:56,006 --> 01:12:01,006
- Wrapped her up
in toilet paper.

967
01:12:03,422 --> 01:12:04,548
- And threw her away?

968
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:05,381
- Yes.

969
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:09,047
- But first you had to
cut the umbilical cord.

970
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:15,714
Did you hold her while
you chewed the cord?

971
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:20,589
Was she still in the
leg of your snow pants?

972
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:22,130
- [Stephanie] I don't remember.

973
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,506
- What did you do
with your hands?

974
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:25,673
- I don't know.

975
01:12:28,965 --> 01:12:30,339
- Tell me what you
believe happened.

976
01:12:30,339 --> 01:12:32,839
- What if what I believe
turns out not to be true.

977
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:36,297
- Then stop believing it.

978
01:12:40,214 --> 01:12:41,339
- I don't remember.

979
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:53,172
- I think we're done here.

980
01:12:58,089 --> 01:12:59,089
Did you think about
getting any help?

981
01:12:59,089 --> 01:13:00,506
- No.

982
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:01,548
- [Lydie] No, it
didn't occur to you,

983
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:03,506
or no you didn't want any help?

984
01:13:03,506 --> 01:13:05,881
- [Stephanie] Both, I already
knew she was gonna be dead.

985
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,589
- [Lydie] How did you know that?

986
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:09,589
- Just knew.

987
01:13:10,923 --> 01:13:12,506
- [Lydie] And then?

988
01:13:14,047 --> 01:13:16,714
- [Stephanie] And there she was.

989
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:21,881
- [Doctor] So when do
the headaches begin?

990
01:13:21,881 --> 01:13:23,006
- [Lydie] This morning.

991
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,506
- The baby is fine.

992
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:32,714
- He stopped kicking and
I thought, I don't know.

993
01:13:32,714 --> 01:13:33,965
I don't know what I thought.

994
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:36,464
- Lydie, when you had
your miscarriage,

995
01:13:36,464 --> 01:13:38,714
did you talk to someone,
a grief counselor--

996
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,631
- A stillbirth after 20
weeks it's a stillbirth.

997
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,506
Not a miscarriage.

998
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:44,464
- Stillbirth, I'm sorry.

999
01:13:44,464 --> 01:13:46,089
- Yeah, sure I
talked to someone.

1000
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,006
- And?

1001
01:13:49,923 --> 01:13:51,464
- That's not this baby.

1002
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,339
- What are you so afraid of?

1003
01:13:57,422 --> 01:13:58,589
For having this baby?

1004
01:14:07,297 --> 01:14:09,214
- Just afraid of...

1005
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:19,214
Being afraid of
absolutely everything.

1006
01:14:25,798 --> 01:14:29,589
- [Jane] Sweetie, Jane,
reminder about dinner tonight.

1007
01:14:29,589 --> 01:14:31,464
Be here, be hungry.

1008
01:14:38,923 --> 01:14:41,339
(chattering)

1009
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:57,923
- Do you have piercings?

1010
01:14:57,923 --> 01:14:58,756
- Yeah.

1011
01:14:58,756 --> 01:14:59,589
- Does it hurt?

1012
01:15:00,673 --> 01:15:01,714
- Just for a second.

1013
01:15:03,006 --> 01:15:03,839
- Yeah.

1014
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:36,172
- You missed a great dinner.

1015
01:15:37,172 --> 01:15:38,506
- Was Jane furious?

1016
01:15:38,506 --> 01:15:39,339
- Yeah.

1017
01:15:41,256 --> 01:15:43,839
And she sent some leftovers.

1018
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,172
(chuckling)

1019
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:51,631
You pierced your ears.

1020
01:15:54,422 --> 01:15:55,256
- Just one.

1021
01:16:09,506 --> 01:16:10,339
- It's nice.

1022
01:16:23,839 --> 01:16:24,673
What?

1023
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:28,589
- It was in the
bathroom, you tell me.

1024
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:32,923
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1025
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,548
- Are you sleeping
with someone else?

1026
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:41,256
- No.

1027
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:47,714
- Don't know how to believe you.

1028
01:16:47,714 --> 01:16:50,089
- There is no how, either
you do or you don't.

1029
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:52,172
If it's any consolation,
I think about it.

1030
01:16:54,339 --> 01:16:55,172
A lot.

1031
01:16:55,172 --> 01:16:56,881
- Jesus, I don't care
what you think about.

1032
01:16:56,881 --> 01:16:58,506
I care about what you do.

1033
01:16:58,506 --> 01:17:00,923
- I haven't done anything.

1034
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:04,965
Better?

1035
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:11,214
- What's happening to us?

1036
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,798
- Last spring is
happening to us.

1037
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:21,923
We should have given her a name.

1038
01:17:22,923 --> 01:17:23,923
And a service.

1039
01:17:26,172 --> 01:17:28,965
But we pretended like
nothing happened.

1040
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:33,172
- I think about her every day.

1041
01:17:33,172 --> 01:17:35,047
- You're ashamed and
there's a difference

1042
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:37,798
between shame and grief.

1043
01:17:37,798 --> 01:17:39,381
- Don't be smug with me, Paul.

1044
01:17:40,548 --> 01:17:41,756
- Do you know what I think?

1045
01:17:42,589 --> 01:17:44,506
I think you don't
want this baby.

1046
01:17:46,589 --> 01:17:48,381
- I want this baby.

1047
01:17:54,339 --> 01:17:55,256
- What about me?

1048
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:58,673
Do you want me?

1049
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,381
- I don't know.

1050
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:16,422
- I'll sleep at the office.

1051
01:18:43,506 --> 01:18:45,339
- [Boy] Stephanie!

1052
01:18:45,339 --> 01:18:47,256
I want you to have my baby!

1053
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:48,839
(hollering)

1054
01:18:48,839 --> 01:18:51,756
(glass shattering)

1055
01:18:59,089 --> 01:19:00,673
- [Miri] Stephanie.

1056
01:19:11,006 --> 01:19:13,172
(sobbing)

1057
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:17,548
- Mom.

1058
01:19:18,798 --> 01:19:20,256
I really need to talk to you.

1059
01:19:21,839 --> 01:19:24,506
(phone ringing)

1060
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:29,589
- Hello?

1061
01:19:53,965 --> 01:19:56,130
(moaning)

1062
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:09,130
(suspenseful music)

1063
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:34,631
(phone ringing)

1064
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:40,214
Hello?

1065
01:20:42,339 --> 01:20:43,172
Hello?

1066
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:44,923
Hello?

1067
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:53,881
(deer thumping)
(tires squealing)

1068
01:21:50,923 --> 01:21:52,631
I'm in labor.

1069
01:21:52,631 --> 01:21:53,464
- Here let me help
you up, come on.

1070
01:21:53,464 --> 01:21:54,673
- I wanna stay here.

1071
01:21:55,881 --> 01:21:57,297
- [Man] You sure?

1072
01:21:57,297 --> 01:21:58,548
- [Lydie] Yeah.

1073
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:23,798
(phone ringing)

1074
01:22:25,756 --> 01:22:28,256
(cat meowing)

1075
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:58,714
- [Frank] Hey.

1076
01:22:58,714 --> 01:22:59,548
- Hey.

1077
01:22:59,548 --> 01:23:00,381
- [Frank] You just missed him.

1078
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:02,006
- Yeah.

1079
01:23:02,006 --> 01:23:04,130
- [Frank] You wanna
try his cell?

1080
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,006
- No.

1081
01:23:05,006 --> 01:23:05,881
- Hm.

1082
01:23:07,256 --> 01:23:08,339
Hey, look.

1083
01:23:11,256 --> 01:23:12,881
About what happened.

1084
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:15,923
I don't wanna come
between you and Paul.

1085
01:23:21,589 --> 01:23:22,422
- Me and Paul.

1086
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,839
Remember when we were
pregnant that first time,

1087
01:23:35,839 --> 01:23:37,965
we were so close.

1088
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:41,631
And that baby.

1089
01:23:44,756 --> 01:23:47,214
I felt like I really
knew that baby.

1090
01:23:47,214 --> 01:23:48,631
- I remember, you were happy.

1091
01:23:50,965 --> 01:23:55,965
- Apparently after 20
weeks, the fetus is not

1092
01:23:56,965 --> 01:24:00,464
considered medical waste,
it's the responsibility

1093
01:24:00,464 --> 01:24:02,339
of the parents to
dispose of the body.

1094
01:24:03,673 --> 01:24:08,006
We had her cremated, so
we're driving home with our

1095
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:12,756
box of ashes, and arguing
about whether to have a

1096
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:15,297
service or not, and
Paul wanted one.

1097
01:24:16,506 --> 01:24:17,339
And I didn't.

1098
01:24:18,798 --> 01:24:22,673
And we're driving 23
past the corn fields,

1099
01:24:22,673 --> 01:24:24,130
where they're building there.

1100
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:30,381
And, I just road down the
window and shook 'em out.

1101
01:24:42,798 --> 01:24:47,798
Paul just stopped the car
and got out and walked away.

1102
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:51,923
- [Frank] What did ya do?

1103
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:54,297
- I waited.

1104
01:24:55,839 --> 01:24:56,673
- He come back?

1105
01:25:00,339 --> 01:25:01,839
- Paul always comes back.

1106
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:37,714
- I'm going to take
a plea bargain.

1107
01:25:40,631 --> 01:25:42,089
- I think that's a good idea.

1108
01:25:46,214 --> 01:25:48,214
- Criminally negligent homicide.

1109
01:25:49,965 --> 01:25:51,881
My lawyer says I'll
get five years.

1110
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:57,422
But if I go to jail for
six months then I might

1111
01:25:57,422 --> 01:25:58,548
be able to get parole.

1112
01:26:00,172 --> 01:26:01,172
- You'll get parole.

1113
01:26:04,256 --> 01:26:05,464
- Baby coming soon?

1114
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:06,506
- Yeah, soon.

1115
01:26:07,631 --> 01:26:08,464
Hey.

1116
01:26:11,422 --> 01:26:12,506
What happened?

1117
01:26:20,381 --> 01:26:21,381
- I held her.

1118
01:26:25,339 --> 01:26:26,172
- What?

1119
01:26:30,631 --> 01:26:31,464
- I held her.

1120
01:26:36,006 --> 01:26:36,881
She barely moved.

1121
01:26:42,214 --> 01:26:43,422
She was so small.

1122
01:26:45,506 --> 01:26:46,714
She wasn't crying.

1123
01:26:52,089 --> 01:26:54,089
Breathing was all wrong.

1124
01:26:57,256 --> 01:26:59,256
I knew that she
wanted to live but...

1125
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:06,047
But I didn't want her to so I...

1126
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,756
Told her to die.

1127
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:20,339
And she did.

1128
01:27:27,172 --> 01:27:28,464
I killed her with my mind.

1129
01:27:50,297 --> 01:27:51,297
- Thank you.

1130
01:28:08,214 --> 01:28:10,965
(tranquil music)
