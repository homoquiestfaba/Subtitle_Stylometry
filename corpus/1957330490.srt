1
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:04,375
(light chiming)

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,287
(light playful music)

3
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:39,926
(gentle music)
(water splashing)

4
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,387
- [Bridget] I'm stuck.

5
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,827
Can someone help me with this line please?

6
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:53,410
(Sam laughing)

7
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,620
Can someone help me with my line?

8
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,573
Mom, I snagged my line.

9
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,093
- I can't help you,
Bridge, I'm tying this fly.

10
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,310
(water splashing)

11
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,390
Sam!

12
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,123
- Come on, Mom, take the plunge.

13
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,240
Come on, you're not gonna melt.

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,073
- Now, you heard the boy.

15
00:02:12,073 --> 00:02:12,906
Get in this water right now.

16
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,700
(fishing pole clacking)
Whoa, hey, there we go.

17
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,530
- Nice one, Dad.
- That's a big one.

18
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,942
- [Jesse] Yeah, it's a good size.

19
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,285
(water splashing)
- Sam!

20
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:21,450
- Gotcha!

21
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,840
Oh, take that, take that.

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,583
- Sam!
- Oh, you are so dead.

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,110
- Well, I think I just caught us dinner.

24
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,980
- Not the way Sam eats.

25
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,770
- Want me to catch a bear?

26
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,680
- I actually think he prefers moose.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,373
- Ah, well, Sam is a moose.

28
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,206
(Bridget laughing)

29
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,410
- [Bridget] You really do
look like a moose, Sam.

30
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,822
- [Sam] At least I don't
look like an elephant.

31
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:47,822
Got ya.
(water splashing)

32
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,313
- Okay, guys, let's get packed up.

33
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,731
- I would I could get my line out.

34
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:59,272
Will someone help me with this please?

35
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:02,450
- [Jesse] Bridge, you take
care of that mess downstairs?

36
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,190
- Yeah, well, I will if you buy a new suit

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,483
for my sweet 16 party.

38
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,590
- Wait a minute, I never heard about this.

39
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,423
What's wrong with my old suit?

40
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,050
- According to style, like last century.

41
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,753
Mom, please make him buy a new suit.

42
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,243
- I've never been able to
make your father do anything.

43
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:17,290
- I never heard about this.

44
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,500
When did this, wait...

45
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,660
Wanna cook?

46
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,200
- Dad.
- Come on, Bridge.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,033
- Seriously.

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,331
- Fine, you want me to buy a
new suit, I'll buy a new suit.

49
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:30,331
- Thank you.
- Yes.

50
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,913
- Hello!
- Hey, there they are.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,960
- Oh, Burt, Ellen, hi.
- Susannah!

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,740
So you were the surprise.

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,590
Wonderful.
- We haven't seen you

54
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,750
in front of that grill for years.

55
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,170
- We haven't seen that grill for years.

56
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,380
- Yeah, well Jess seems
to think a seasoned grill

57
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,773
means never cleaning it.
(Ellen laughing)

58
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:50,210
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

59
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,670
- Do you guys know what a buffalo says

60
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,561
to his son on the way to school?

61
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,590
- Not this one again.
- No.

62
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,582
- What does a buffalo-
- Bye, son.

63
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,220
(family laughing)

64
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,692
- Who taught you that one?
- It took me a second.

65
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:01,892
- [Jesse] It did, it took me a second too.

66
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:04,210
- It's better than you.
- That was a good one.

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,210
- Well, I for one have had
a wonderful time today,

68
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,130
but it's time we headed back home.

69
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,590
- Mom, we don't have
to go back yet, do we?

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,670
- Yeah, honey, we do.

71
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,330
- Mom, come on, it's summer vacation.

72
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,990
- I can't miss the after
theater dinner crowd

73
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,830
and I don't want your
father to make two trips.

74
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,830
- No, no, I don't mind.

75
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,830
I can take 'em back Monday night.

76
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,373
- Please, Mom.
- Oh, come on.

77
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,543
- Okay.

78
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,930
- Actually, Derek is due in Monday night

79
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,181
and I have to go to town
anyway, so I can haul 'em.

80
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,260
- [Bridget] Is that one
of your 10,000 grandkids?

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,693
- Yeah, from Los Angeles.

82
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,720
Jane's going through
a pretty nasty divorce

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,263
and they thought he'd have a
better summer up here with us.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,480
- So, just what kinda
after theater dinner crowd

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,290
is there in Anchorage anyway?

86
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,330
- Well, not that you ever noticed,

87
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,570
but there is some culture
to be gleaned in the city.

88
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,010
- Yes, a lot more than there is

89
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,420
to be gleaned out here
in the sticks I guess.

90
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,080
I mean, not that I ever
got tired of this, but-

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,113
- Guys, come on.

92
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,200
It was such a good day.

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,873
- Sorry, hun.

94
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,553
- Come on, Suze, I'll take you back.

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,460
- [Susannah] See you guys
again sometime, okay?

96
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,500
- Soon.

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,333
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

98
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,350
- Bye, bye, bye, bye.
- Bye, Mom.

99
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,763
- Bye.
(somber music)

100
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,870
Well, if any of us thought
that they might be getting

101
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,831
back together, I think
today pretty much killed it.

102
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:24,831
(somber music continues)
(plane engine rumbling)

103
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:41,898
(water splashing)

104
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,295
- [Jesse] Well, thanks for
roughing it for the day.

105
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,846
- [Dock Crew] It's
secure, you're all good.

106
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,875
- [Jesse] I guess we won't be
doing that again anytime soon.

107
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,900
- I don't know what makes you think I ever

108
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,847
had anything against the wilderness.

109
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:52,880
I used to love it up there.

110
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,710
- Couldn't seem to get away fast enough.

111
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,584
- Yeah, 15 years is a real clean getaway.

112
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:57,417
- Well, I guess that wasn't
even the thing you trying-

113
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,910
- Jesse, can we not do this right now?

114
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,650
- Okay, fine.
- We already know this

115
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,413
argument by heart.
- Yeah, sure do.

116
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:11,262
(door slamming)
(plane engine rumbling)

117
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,840
- Oh, thank God you're here.

118
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,870
- What?
- Okay, the salmon's

119
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,543
not fresh, Andrew
dropped a case of Merlot,

120
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:23,070
and the mayor just popped
by with a party of 12.

121
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,127
He had to wait half an hour.

122
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,810
- Oh, well, find a bottle
of Merlot that didn't break,

123
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,120
and send it over to his
table with my compliments.

124
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,820
And why on earth do we
bother living in Alaska

125
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,170
if we can't get fresh salmon?

126
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,003
- I don't know.

127
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,313
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,023
How was family day in the sticks?

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,400
- It was great, until Jesse
started pushing my buttons.

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,540
- How is Gary Cooper anyway?

131
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,610
- Jesse is fine and his cowboy charm

132
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,690
wore off a long time ago.

133
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,950
- Yeah, but not his
good looks though, huh?

134
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,727
- Yeah, he's attractive,
I'll give you that,

135
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:54,990
but you try staying home through

136
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,990
one too many week long fishing trips and-

137
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,720
- And then you come up and you
go to bed with Gary Cooper.

138
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,220
Look, I don't see the problem.

139
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,110
- That's good.
- I know.

140
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,520
- Try putting up with it for 15 years.

141
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,040
I mean, he'd be working so
hard to pay off the house,

142
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,130
and then I'd be home with three kids,

143
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,500
alone in the middle of nowhere.

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,920
- Yeah, well, at least you
had the kids to talk to.

145
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,610
I mean, Rich used to
go off on an oil tanker

146
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,850
for six months at a time, you know?

147
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,690
Well, it's been great.

148
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,630
I mean, if I hadn't
have broken up with him,

149
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,460
I never would have gone to cooking school,

150
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,780
I never would have met
you and got this job,

151
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,530
and well, a real life, you know?

152
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,810
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take
shaky financial independence

153
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,403
over good companionship
and regular sex anyway.

154
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,074
- It wasn't that regular.
(Susannah laughing)

155
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:42,574
(light music)

156
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:53,691
- It's Dad.
(plane engine rumbling)

157
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,284
(water splashing)

158
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:11,219
(car engine rumbling)

159
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,943
He brought nerds.
- Great.

160
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,935
- Hannah, go tell Burt and
Ellen that Derek came in early.

161
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:16,768
All right?

162
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,900
So, this is my house.

163
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,886
It's nothing fancy, but you
guys didn't come to sit inside.

164
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:25,719
Hey, you.

165
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:39,875
(birds chirping)

166
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,720
- Derek.

167
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,100
Derek, come on and sit down, son.

168
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,003
Teach you how to tie a fly.

169
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,933
You haven't said a word
since you've been here.

170
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,755
How's your mom doing?

171
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,933
- You talk to her on the
phone every week don't you?

172
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,393
- Yes, but you see her everyday.

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,300
And it's hard for me to
know if she's been crying

174
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,367
when I'm talking to her on the phone.

175
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,310
- Well, then, to answer your questions,

176
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,730
no, she isn't doing very well,

177
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,353
and yes, she cries all the time.

178
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:21,410
(Bridget scoffs)
- He was just asking.

179
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,060
You don't have to be such a jerk.

180
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,760
- Since I'm here against my will,

181
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,430
I think I can be a jerk
for at least a few days.

182
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,480
- Well, at least there's an end in sight.

183
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:34,080
(door slamming)

184
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:36,530
(Jesse sighs)

185
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,275
- Well, the guys'll be ready in a minute.

186
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:42,350
They're on a video conference.

187
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,795
Hey, let's get packed up.

188
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,894
Come on, it's time to go.
- I found it.

189
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:47,977
- Ah, thanks.

190
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:52,002
See ya.
- See ya.

191
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,217
- Have fun, guys.

192
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,520
- Ellen, how come no women ever wanna stay

193
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
at the Wilderness Ranch?

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,750
- Women are smart enough
to go to the Bahamas.

195
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,030
- You know, 'cause I've been thinking

196
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,893
if mom and dad are really
over, I think it's time we have

197
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:06,150
to start thinking about the future.

198
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,683
I mean, dad needs a woman.

199
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,860
He never goes into the city

200
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,247
and they certainly never come out here.

201
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:14,086
- [Ellen] And what makes you
think your dad needs a woman?

202
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:15,696
- 'Cause he's lonely.

203
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:16,976
- [Susannah] Hannah's right.

204
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,665
Dad's a good looking guy,
he's probably got needs.

205
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:19,582
- Oh, Lord.

206
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,156
- How about a set up.

207
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:22,989
Don't you have a cousin in Juno?

208
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,091
- Well, yeah, but she's 58 years old.

209
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,180
- Oh.

210
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,240
- You know, by the off chance

211
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,944
that you're serious about this,

212
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:34,527
what about something like this?

213
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,404
- "Alaska Love," what is that?

214
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,484
(Ellen giggling)

215
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,464
- [Burt] Oh, you are bad.

216
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:43,720
- [Ellen] Well, I only
buy it for the crosswords.

217
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,560
- Oh, sure, millions of men buy Playboy

218
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,380
just to read the articles.

219
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,470
That was a hunting and fishing journal,

220
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,216
and a couple of years ago
somebody started a personal column

221
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:55,176
and it took over the whole magazine.

222
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,235
- What kinda personals?

223
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:57,760
- Oh, yeah, love connections.

224
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,730
There's a lotta lonely men in Alaska,

225
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,750
and a lotta women looking to meet 'em.

226
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,803
- Really?
- Sure.

227
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,630
How do you think I met Ellen?

228
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,050
Mail order bride right there.

229
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,883
- Oh, stop that.

230
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,740
- I still go the box she came in.

231
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,770
Marked "fragile, handle with care."

232
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,603
- He's kidding.

233
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,180
So, what do you think?

234
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,453
Divine inspiration?

235
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,176
(water splashing)
- I got one.

236
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:21,009
I got one.

237
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:22,748
I got one!

238
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,448
- Yeah, yeah, good, good, good.

239
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:26,281
All right, good, good.

240
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:28,600
No, easy now, easy, easy, easy, easy.

241
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,309
That's it, pull her in.

242
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:31,476
All right, up.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
(light music)

244
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,148
Too small.

245
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:40,981
Hey, hey.

246
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:46,137
(both laughing)

247
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:47,550
All right, you.

248
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,383
Lights out.

249
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,640
- Do you ever get lonely, Dad?

250
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,143
- Oh, sweetie, I don't
have time to get lonely.

251
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,490
- Don't you miss mom?

252
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:01,939
- Uh...
(soft music)

253
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:04,470
It's a little tough seeing
her like that yesterday.

254
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,440
Brought back some good memories.

255
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,980
- Like when you first brought her up here?

256
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,880
- Yeah, that's right.

257
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,380
(Jesse chuckling)

258
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,660
Yeah, I'd come up here to work
one summer during college,

259
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,310
and I just fell in love with Alaska.

260
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,780
- You wanted to build a ranch,

261
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,930
but grandpa wanted you to work for him.

262
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,763
- He sure did.

263
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,840
Yeah, at that point, real
estate sounded as good

264
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,443
as anything else I guess.

265
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,400
- But Momma knew you'd hate it,
so she didn't let you do it.

266
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,910
- That's exactly right.

267
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,500
She knew I'd go crazy wearing a suit

268
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,223
and talking on the phone all day.

269
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,444
- [Hannah] So, you did it.

270
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:41,186
- Ah, we did it.

271
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,830
You know your mom stood right next to me

272
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,710
when we told your grandpa?

273
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,083
He got so angry.

274
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,120
Ah, but he got over it.

275
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,630
And your mom and I got married,

276
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,610
and we had us three beautiful
little kiddie, kiddie,

277
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,174
kiddies like you.
(Hannah giggling)

278
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:01,866
- And then?

279
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,199
- Uh and then...

280
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,977
Well, here we are.

281
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,449
(somber music)

282
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,792
Hey, listen, you.

283
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:22,106
You sleep, okay?

284
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,273
I love you.
- Love you too.

285
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:34,405
(birds chirping)

286
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:38,143
(door creaking)

287
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:53,473
(cereal crunching)

288
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,057
- Morning.

289
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,023
I said good morning, grouchy.

290
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,263
- Sorry.

291
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,375
I didn't sleep at all last night.

292
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,004
Did you guys even realize
that the sun never went down?

293
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,410
(children laughing)

294
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,410
- Welcome to the top of the world.

295
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,860
- Yeah, for a couple
of weeks in the summer

296
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,773
we have almost 24 hours of daylight.

297
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,773
- Huh, cool.

298
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,573
- I couldn't sleep either.

299
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,450
I don't think Daddy wants
to be alone anymore.

300
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,080
- How do you know what Dad wants?

301
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,330
- Because he talks to me.

302
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,493
He does.
- Yeah, right.

303
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,320
- You know what, I couldn't
stop thinking about

304
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,983
that "Alaska Love" magazine.

305
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,497
- Maybe we could send Dad's picture in?

306
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:50,550
- Are you crazy?

307
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,940
You'd have better luck auctioning
him off on the internet.

308
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,273
Only desperate guys do personal ads.

309
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,660
- Oh, morning, Dad.

310
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,133
- [Jesse] Hm.

311
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,373
- Hello, desperate guy.

312
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,870
(Jesse groaning)

313
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,804
- Okay, what do we have to fill out?

314
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,200
(light music)

315
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,760
- [Hannah] Make sure she likes kids.

316
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
- Yeah, if you find a woman with two boys,

317
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,597
a girl and a dog named
Tiger, you're all set.

318
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:23,100
- Now, how do we even know that Dad's

319
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,170
gonna have enough choices
to be picky about?

320
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,720
- Because we're really gonna sell him.

321
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,453
He's handsome, funny, caring, giving,

322
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,413
and he always makes you laugh
if you're feeling upset.

323
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,733
- Oh, hey, put down that he's
good in case of an emergency.

324
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,313
Remember when that guy
from Ohio almost drowned,

325
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,722
then Dad gave him CPR and saved him?

326
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,343
- That, that's good.

327
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,890
- Hey, you guys didn't fill
out the cultural interest form.

328
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,453
Does he like music or art?

329
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,870
Does he read any books?

330
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,411
- He read me "Curious George Goes

331
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,661
To The Hospital" last week.

332
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,953
- I'll make up something good.

333
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:02,786
- So, what does he have
to say about all this?

334
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,610
You're not telling him?

335
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,090
- Well, it's not like he'd
actually go along with it.

336
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,260
- Uh, I think his reaction
might be a tad bit stronger

337
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,800
than "I'm not going along with this."

338
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,930
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

339
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,520
By the time the letters start coming,

340
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,820
it'll be too late to stop it.

341
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,330
- You guys oughta sell real estate.

342
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,480
Maybe even used cars.

343
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,090
You got a real knack
for making a fixer-upper

344
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,440
sound like the find of the century.

345
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,850
- But he is the find of the century.

346
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,730
- Yeah, we're just
worried no one will find

347
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,043
the find up here.

348
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,860
- What about your mom?

349
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,650
Anybody worried about
her being on her own?

350
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,840
- Mom's different, she dates.

351
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,291
Knows how to do all this kinda stuff.

352
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,124
- Yeah.

353
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:45,400
- So, you had fun out at the ranch?

354
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,590
- I did, it was really nice to
get out there with the kids.

355
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,323
Stretch my legs and breathe the fresh air.

356
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:52,230
- Mm hm.
- That's not to say

357
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,810
I'm not having a lovely time
ducking out of work today

358
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,271
to go to the museum with you.

359
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,520
- Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

360
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,220
It's not how I meant it.

361
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,190
I'm not trying to compete with your family

362
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,200
or your husband or anything-
- Ex-husband and of course

363
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,623
you're trying to compete
with him, you're a man.

364
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,141
- Oh, well, don't hold
anything in, Susannah.

365
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,903
Just tell me what you really think.

366
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,097
- Was that blunt?
- Wasn't subtle.

367
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,693
- I'm sorry, I have been
told I can be blunt.

368
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
- Well, I'll be blunt too.

369
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,220
It's been two months.

370
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,133
How am I doing?

371
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,803
- You want the long version
or the short version?

372
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,650
- Uh, any chance a guy
can bum a cup of coffee?

373
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,600
- Uh, can I give you a rain check?

374
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,270
The kids are gonna be back soon and...

375
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,103
- Sure.
- Okay.

376
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,250
- Um, actually, Susannah,
I don't wanna sound...

377
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,910
Well, I'm just being a
really good boy scout here,

378
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,980
but I'm also a boy.
- I know, I'm sorry.

379
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,090
I just, you know I'm just trying
to get used to this dating,

380
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,667
relationship thing again.

381
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,980
- And I don't wanna rush something
that's worth waiting for.

382
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,813
- Thank you.

383
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:05,918
(car engine rumbling)

384
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,170
(car door slamming)

385
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,893
- Mom.

386
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:20,930
- I better go.
- Okay.

387
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,430
- Call you later.
- Thanks.

388
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,740
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

389
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,157
- [Sam] Hey.

390
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,162
- Hm.

391
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:27,573
- Hi.
- Hey, Mom.

392
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,024
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Good seeing you.

393
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:35,060
(dogs barking)

394
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,660
- [Jesse] Well, I guess
I don't need to ask

395
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,260
how the rest of your weekend was.

396
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,307
- No, you don't.

397
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,963
- It looked like he was on his way in.

398
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,953
- I asked.
- Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,233
- But he has to get up early for court.

400
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,800
- Let me guess, he's a
big defense attorney,

401
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,590
working hard to get those
criminals back on the street asap.

402
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,210
- Well, not that it's
any of your business,

403
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,430
but he's actually trying
a big class action suit

404
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,530
against one of the oil refineries up here.

405
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,473
- Wow, a real job and principles to boot.

406
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,675
Well, maybe you found what
you were always looking for.

407
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:11,925
- Maybe I have.

408
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,143
Don't you have a plane to catch?

409
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:20,373
- It's okay, I know the pilot.

410
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,725
- Good night.
- Yeah.

411
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:26,225
(light music)

412
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,657
- I've got a secret.
- Oh, you do?

413
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:32,623
- It's about dad.
- Wow, so, spill it.

414
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:36,614
Good night.

415
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,433
You know what she's talking about?

416
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,375
- Hm (spits), hardly ever do.

417
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,694
(Susannah chuckling)
- Good night.

418
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:50,194
(light music)

419
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:55,888
You know what Hannah's secret is?

420
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:56,721
- No idea.

421
00:19:58,757 --> 00:19:59,840
I don't know.

422
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,807
- You guys are up to something.

423
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:06,768
(Bridget giggling)

424
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:07,685
Lights out.

425
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:09,780
Now.

426
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:16,340
(gentle music)

427
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,085
- Hi.
- Hey.

428
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,103
- So, I ran into Burt at the store

429
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:25,098
and he said you were here.

430
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,838
- Yeah, yeah, I had to get some new CDs.

431
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:29,458
I think it's gonna be fine.

432
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,020
So, what were you doing at the store?

433
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,370
- I was checking out the magazines.

434
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,359
- Did you find out if they're gonna print

435
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,770
the article or not?

436
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,683
- No, not a word.

437
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,530
I got you something.

438
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,983
- Thanks.

439
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,631
- It's so you can sleep.

440
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:50,010
- I'm just gonna take a wild guess and say

441
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,271
that I look like a complete
moron with this on.

442
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,200
(Bridget laughing)

443
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,450
- It wasn't my intention.

444
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,373
- Yeah.

445
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,759
Thanks.

446
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,599
(light music)

447
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,099
- All right, guys, here we go.

448
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,823
Oh my...

449
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,721
- Oh, my God.
- No way.

450
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:15,431
(children giggling)

451
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:17,203
- That is such a good picture.

452
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:20,670
- Look at that one.
- That's good.

453
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,720
- So, what's so great about the magazine?

454
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,230
- That's our dad.

455
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,757
- Your dad?

456
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,738
- We're surprising him.

457
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,603
- Man, you guys are in a world of trouble.

458
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,043
- Why?
- Why?

459
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:37,315
Bring it over here.

460
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:38,507
I'll show you why.

461
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:46,568
A subscribership of over 200,000.

462
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:47,401
- 200,000?
(Sam gasps)

463
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:50,779
- [Cashier] And that doesn't
include over the counter sales.

464
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,597
- Are you serious?

465
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:54,750
(cashier chuckling)
- 200,000?

466
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,583
- Bridge, what's wrong?

467
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,416
It turned out great.

468
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,463
- Mm hm.
- Way to go, kids.

469
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:04,820
- "I'm looking for someone
who likes adventure,

470
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,137
barbecued ribs and children."

471
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,080
- Well, I'd write him
a letter, I'll yell ya.

472
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,400
- Oh.
(both laughing)

473
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,900
- What?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

474
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:20,071
- You two need to get out more.

475
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,900
- You going to town today?

476
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,900
- Yeah, I gotta buy a
suit for Bridget's party.

477
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,747
Why, you need anything?

478
00:22:29,747 --> 00:22:31,550
- No, just asking.
- All right.

479
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,890
- Oh, don't forget to
stop at the post office.

480
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,471
They called and said they
had some packages for you.

481
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:39,759
- Yeah, that's weird.

482
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,509
Don't remember ordering anything.

483
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,989
(light music)

484
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,123
- [Susannah] Josie, you're late.

485
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,229
- I was detained at the news stand.

486
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:03,062
- What?

487
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,087
Oh, my God.

488
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:12,126
- Gary Cooper rides again.

489
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,293
- Oh, my God.

490
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,600
(light music)

491
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,663
(mail bags thudding)

492
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,330
- I have 41 pounds of letters and packages

493
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,173
from all over the country.

494
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,110
Any idea what's going on here?

495
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,723
What?

496
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,663
What?

497
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:07,975
Did you do this?

498
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,480
- I have a sneaking suspicion
it was your children.

499
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,110
- I'm gonna kill 'em.

500
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,853
All three of 'em.

501
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:19,548
No jury would convict me.

502
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:21,163
Oh, man!

503
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,853
Oh!

504
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,320
Where did they even hear
about a rag like this?

505
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,180
- Don't look at me.

506
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,250
That's not where I go to shop for men,

507
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,973
or even trade 'em in.
(Susannah chuckling)

508
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,948
- What am I gonna do with this stuff?

509
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,338
- I don't know.

510
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:45,199
(Jesse sighs)

511
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,810
(Susannah laughing)

512
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,700
- Why did we decide to have kids again?

513
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,100
- We were young and in love.

514
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,503
Come on, let's go find you a suit.

515
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,230
- [Jesse] You sure about this, gray?

516
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,743
- Trust me, I shopped for you for years.

517
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,559
- What?

518
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,800
What's the matter, is it okay?

519
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,900
- Yeah.

520
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,793
Yeah, sure.

521
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,733
Let's just find you a tie.

522
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,290
- What, no clip-ons?

523
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,582
- [Susannah] Mm hm.

524
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,450
Maybe you should think about
getting some new shirts

525
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,090
and some underwear.

526
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,590
- I don't need a mother, Suze.

527
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,080
- Well, maybe you do need somebody.

528
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,306
Maybe that's what he kids
are trying to tell you.

529
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:50,463
- Well, why don't they just tell me?

530
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:53,410
Instead of sneaking around behind my back.

531
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,480
(Jesse grumbling)
- Wait.

532
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,800
Why don't you just read
some of the letters.

533
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,580
I mean, what harm could it do?

534
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,350
Misguided or not, the kids
went to a lotta trouble

535
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,723
in a very sweet effort to help you.

536
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,620
- Well, why can't they
help you find somebody?

537
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,970
Oh, that's right, you already have.

538
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,963
How is Sebastian?

539
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,680
- Stephen is his name as you well know,

540
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,630
and he's wonderful.

541
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,048
- Well, maybe I will read some letters.

542
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,298
Look at some video tapes.

543
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:23,160
Ah, granted my future
dating plans didn't involve

544
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,119
putting out an all-points bulletin.

545
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,280
- He's gonna need those pants.

546
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,100
- But there could be someone wonderful

547
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,350
just waiting in that bag.

548
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:32,230
You know?

549
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,000
Seriously doubt it.

550
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,530
- Well, now, see, that's the picture

551
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,130
that should've run on the cover.

552
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,133
Pants.

553
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,412
Give them to me.

554
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,310
(light music)

555
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,189
(car doors slamming)

556
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,259
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

557
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,488
Look who it is.

558
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:10,597
Here, grab this for me, will ya?

559
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:12,680
Ut oh, take this one too.

560
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,580
While you're at it, pick that stuff up.

561
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,413
Hi, there.

562
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,102
- Hi, Dad.
- You know,

563
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,635
it was Bridget's idea.
- Bridget's idea.

564
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:21,789
(Jesse chuckling)

565
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:25,706
You're all grounded for
the rest of your lives.

566
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:34,107
So, your mom wants to read
some of these letters.

567
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:35,533
Why don't you grab those.

568
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:40,207
(gentle music)

569
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,258
- "I can already tell
you're my type, Jesse.

570
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:44,527
My late husband was kind of a cowboy.

571
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:48,428
He smoked unfiltered cigarettes
and drove an El Camino."

572
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:51,222
- Wow.
- What's an El Camino?

573
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:55,870
- It's kind of a car, truck,
hybrid kind of a thing.

574
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,713
No one really understands it.

575
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:58,180
I think we can pass on that one.

576
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,083
- Oh, here's one, Dad.

577
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,180
"I like to go dancing at the techno clubs

578
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,427
and walking in the park."

579
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,260
That's good.

580
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,357
"I know New York seems like a world away-"

581
00:28:06,357 --> 00:28:07,697
(paper crinkling)
- Pass!

582
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:10,680
- "Dear, Jesse, my name is Chloe Walton,

583
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,320
I'm 32, blonde, five foot, eight,

584
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,633
and love the outdoors.

585
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm a marine biologist and spent some time

586
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,077
in Alaska helping clean up
after the Valdez spill."

587
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:24,248
- All right, go on.

588
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:27,580
- "I'm enclosing a video
tape so we can have

589
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,820
a face-to-face encounter."

590
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,130
Oh, hm.
- Hm, well.

591
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,233
Let's throw it in.

592
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,890
- Mm.
- Hi, Jesse.

593
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,900
I really liked your
bio, but you know what?

594
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,030
I started thinking, well, I bet
a lot of women will as well,

595
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,363
so how do I make a lasting impression?

596
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,270
Well, maybe I'm not
really a marine biologist

597
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:59,030
and maybe I've never been to Alaska,

598
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,153
but I do have this going for me.

599
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,035
I hope you like it.
(Susannah gasps)

600
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,457
- Oh!
(Bridget laughing)

601
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:10,854
(children laughing)

602
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:14,630
- I can't believe that
woman just did that.

603
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,880
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

604
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,880
- Well, kiddies, have we
learned our lesson today?

605
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,003
Hm?

606
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,660
Like maybe this isn't the best way

607
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,663
to set your dad up on a date!

608
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,180
- Dad, they're not all gonna be like this.

609
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,450
- They're not all gonna be anything,

610
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,373
'cause they're printing a retraction.

611
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,206
- You can't do that.

612
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:37,703
I mean, they're already out there.

613
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,810
- Well, then, then you three
are gonna use your allowances

614
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,750
to send every letter and package back.

615
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,462
- What, Dad, wait a minute-
- That is not fair-

616
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:49,160
- This is the last I wanna
hear about "Alaska Love."

617
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,061
- No, Dad.
- Can you-

618
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:51,963
- Ah, ah, ah, am I clear about that?

619
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:56,911
Now, go to bed.

620
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,033
Go on, go, go, go!

621
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:10,918
- Hm.
(Jesse sighs)

622
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:13,300
You were a little hard
'em don't you think?

623
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,560
- Oh and how exactly would you be

624
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,410
if they tried to play cupid with you?

625
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:20,033
- Well, I would've been a little upset.

626
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,028
Okay, I would've gone ballistic.

627
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:27,033
- Thank you.

628
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:30,390
(Susannah laughing)

629
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,840
- Good night, Jesse.

630
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,790
- Good night, Suze.

631
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,080
Thanks for all the help today.

632
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:40,943
- You're welcome.

633
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:52,521
(plane engine rumbling)

634
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:54,440
(mail bags thudding)

635
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,853
- Look, I-
- No, no, no, don't say it.

636
00:30:58,188 --> 00:30:59,538
- Look, I tried-
- Ah, ah!

637
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,373
Not a word.

638
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,760
- I tried to talk 'em out of it.

639
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,593
- Oh, really?

640
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,573
- No.
(both laughing)

641
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:14,866
- [Burt] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

642
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,035
(Burt snorting)

643
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:20,166
(plane engine rumbling)

644
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:20,999
- We expecting anyone?

645
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:24,260
- Oh, you got about a dozen lady callers.

646
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,790
I got all their names and numbers.

647
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,740
Three of 'em just flew into
Anchorage and wanna know

648
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,316
how to get out here right
away, but I just played dumb.

649
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:32,430
(both laughing)

650
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,830
- Please tell me that's a joke.

651
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,935
- No.
- No.

652
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,607
- Well, how did they find me?

653
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,620
- The magazine must've
leaked your telephone number

654
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,453
to the internet.

655
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:40,636
- Oh, give me that.

656
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:42,356
- It's only gonna get worse from here.

657
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:43,476
(fist knocking)

658
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:45,025
- Here they come.
(light music)

659
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:47,775
(Burt chuckling)

660
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:51,540
- Oh, my God, it's really you.

661
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,270
I can't believe I'm really standing here,

662
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,103
and you're standing there.

663
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:56,220
And I brought you these cigars
because I thought, flowers?

664
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,053
No, he's a man.

665
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:57,886
- I thought chocolate?

666
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:59,453
No, he might be a diabetic.

667
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:00,286
You're not are you?

668
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,119
Diabetic I mean.

669
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,130
- Excuse me, who are you?

670
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,500
- Maisie Lee from Chester, Pennsylvania.

671
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,900
- You didn't get my message?

672
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,883
- For five years I've
been reading "Alaska Love"

673
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:12,182
looking for Mr. Right.

674
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,720
- I've been divorced for six years now,

675
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,830
and you know how tough
the single scene is.

676
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,110
- All these blind dates and
trying to figure out what's in-

677
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,340
- And what's out.

678
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,320
- You know, trying to
always watch what you eat.

679
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,305
Well, you understand.

680
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:25,890
- Excuse me, had did you get out here?

681
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,240
- Oh, Mr. Langley was sweet enough

682
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,610
to fly me in on short notice.

683
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,090
- You know he has his own plane?

684
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,140
- Isn't that amazing?

685
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,996
- Every third person in Alaska
has his own plane, Maisie.

686
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,496
And listen, about the article,

687
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,216
I'm afraid there's been some mistake.

688
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:45,783
(door creaking)
(door slamming)

689
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:49,116
(truck engine rumbling)

690
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:02,286
(light swanky music)

691
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:27,085
Hey, Ruthie.

692
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,956
- Hey, Jesse, how you doing?
- Ah, you know.

693
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:31,123
- I'll get you right away.

694
00:33:36,036 --> 00:33:39,119
(light swanky music)

695
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:46,356
Here you go.
- Thanks.

696
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:49,497
- Oh, Jesse, got some mail for you.

697
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,696
(light music)

698
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:03,335
(light swanky music)

699
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,600
- Jesse, I'm Margaret.

700
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,053
I just flew in from Tampa to meet you.

701
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,963
I hope that's all right.

702
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:15,030
- Well, Margaret, that's
very ambitious of you,

703
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,916
but I don't know what universe
that would be all right in.

704
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,680
- That's awfully rude after I
flew 3,000 miles to meet you.

705
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,440
- First of all, Margaret,
I didn't ask you to.

706
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,920
Okay and second of all,

707
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,480
I was polite to the first
dozen women who did it.

708
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,823
Now, I'm just fed up!

709
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:36,635
Now, if you'll excuse me.
(door creaking)

710
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:37,468
Please.

711
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:43,877
(Jesse groaning)

712
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:45,933
- Jesse.
- What?

713
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:46,766
- Don't bark at me.
- I'm sorry.

714
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:49,101
- You forgot your receipt.
- I'm sorry, thank you.

715
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:52,300
I'm sorry, if I see
another woman stalking me,

716
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,590
I'm gonna shoot first
and ask questions later.

717
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,330
- You're living the dream
of every damn man in Alaska.

718
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,477
And still you're not happy.

719
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,625
(light dramatic music)

720
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:13,520
(light swanky music)

721
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,880
- Last weekend, this woman
came all the way from Spain

722
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,113
and pretended to be on a fishing trip.

723
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:19,810
This was wearing this long
dress and these high heels.

724
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,260
- And of course Dad
knew why she was there,

725
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,450
but still took her fishing anyways.

726
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,060
- She lost her fancy shoes in the mud.

727
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,440
- Oh, God, I can't believe you guys

728
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,600
are doing this to your father.

729
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,433
- You know what?

730
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:30,880
I am glad he's meeting new women.

731
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,380
I think he's kind of enjoy it.

732
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,820
- Yeah, okay.

733
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,330
Dad puts on a really good
show of being all ticked off.

734
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,700
- Yeah.
- But he likes the attention.

735
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,130
- Hold that thought.

736
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,973
I wanna talk about this some more.

737
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:44,760
Is there anything else I can get you?

738
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,910
- Oh, another cop of coffee.
- Okay, sure.

739
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,600
Are you a photographer?

740
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,270
- A photojournalist actually.

741
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,420
These guys are climbing a glacier.

742
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,820
I'm gonna go along and document it.

743
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,230
- Oh, it's...

744
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,580
You work for that magazine?

745
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,230
(Gina chuckling)
- Hardly.

746
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,263
No, my sister gave me this as a joke.

747
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,290
I have to admit, this
bachelor looks pretty good.

748
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,210
Hm, he's probably airbrushed.

749
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,260
- No, actually, he, that's
pretty much what he looks like.

750
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,317
- You know him?
- Mm hm.

751
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,081
- You think you could introduce me?

752
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,521
(light dramatic music)

753
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:23,188
(Gina giggling)

754
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:28,709
(light music)

755
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,582
(somber music)

756
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,120
(light music)

757
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,600
- Hey, again.

758
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,310
Jesse, this is Gina.

759
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,330
Gina, Jesse.

760
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,020
Gina is town for a few days and
she wants to see the sights,

761
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,370
so I thought why not the expert.

762
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,203
- Ah.
- You can show her

763
00:36:58,203 --> 00:36:59,540
the lay of the land.
- Great, absolutely.

764
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,373
Here, why don't you join me?

765
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:03,763
I should get rid of
some of this stuff here.

766
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:05,871
Can you?

767
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:06,951
Thanks.

768
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:10,130
Here, let me get this for ya.
- Thank you.

769
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,343
Very sweet of you, thank you.

770
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:13,843
- [Jesse] Oh, so, how are you?

771
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,463
(muffled talking)

772
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,960
(Josie scoffs)

773
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,864
- So, tell me something.

774
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:29,830
I'm kinda curious.

775
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,380
Why on earth have you decided
to back one of the horses

776
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,493
vying for your ex-husband's affections?

777
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:37,770
- I don't know, I...

778
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,936
Maybe the kids had it right?

779
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:41,700
- Hm.
- Maybe Jesse is lonely.

780
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,978
- Mm.

781
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:43,920
- I mean, she seems nice.

782
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,821
- And people thought that-
- Are you serious?

783
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:47,380
- Yes, I'm very serious.

784
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,010
- Oh, yeah.

785
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,621
Very nice.

786
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:53,121
(Josie sighs)

787
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:57,508
(dishes clanking)

788
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:00,075
(birds chirping)
(water trickling)

789
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:02,890
- [Bridget] So, is your
eye mask helping you sleep?

790
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,110
- Yeah, I'm getting used to
this 24 hours of daylight.

791
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,602
I kinda like it now.

792
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:08,983
- Oh, you scared of the dark?

793
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,480
- My parents always fight at night.

794
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,040
That's when they fight most I mean.

795
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,323
What was it like when
your parents split up?

796
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,823
- I couldn't believe it.

797
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:28,723
I mean, I knew my mom felt
cutoff from the world out here,

798
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:30,702
and dad was always working so hard trying

799
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:32,503
to keep the business going.

800
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,387
I don't know, I guess (sighs),

801
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,203
I guess there's a lotta things that go on

802
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:39,753
that we don't always know about.

803
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:43,293
- And then they stop
caring if you know or not.

804
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,550
My parents started
screaming all the bad things

805
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,050
at each other and that's all I could hear.

806
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,043
- It wasn't really like
that with my parents.

807
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,910
Just kept getting quieter and quieter.

808
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,972
- End result's the same I guess.

809
00:38:57,972 --> 00:39:00,472

Well, I say bravo to Josie.

835
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,750
Thank you very much, honey.
- My old lady.

00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,471

- Sam!

837
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:38,750

- Sam, I don't wanna hear it.

838
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,583

birthday and she said no.

Oh, come on.

- Hi.
- Hey.

842
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,400

Wow, hi.

846
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,209
- I hope it's okay.
- No, it's fine.

847
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:54,018
It is, it's great.

848
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,269
Good to see you, yeah.

849
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,683
Come on, let's make room here.

00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:00,270
Yeah, we'll just slide everybody down.

No, here, why don't you.

852
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,510
Everybody, this is Gina.

853
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,558
- Hi.
- Hello.

854
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:07,653
- Nice to meet you.
- Everybody.

855
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,160
This is Bridget, it's her birthday.

856
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,840
Little vision in pink.

857
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,800
She's 16.
- Happy birthday.

858
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,633
- Thanks.

859
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,310
- And you know Susannah.
- Yep.

860
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,160
- That's our little girl, Hannah.

861
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,914
Uh, Suze and I got divorced two years ago.

862
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,571
- [Hannah] Mom, I have two sugar packets.

863
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:28,170
Isn't that when I stop?
(Susannah laughing)

864
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,113
- So, she's helping you
meet other women now?

865
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:34,261
- It was am amicable divorce.

866
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:36,261
- Oh, I'd say.
- I'd say.

867
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:39,544
It's good to see you.

868
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,801
Can I get you anything?

869
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,391
Glass of wine?
- I'll have some wine.

870
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:46,152
- Sure.
- Cake coming through.

871
00:41:46,152 --> 00:41:48,214
- Oh!
- Oh, wow!

872
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,223
(party guests gasping)

873
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:52,500
- Look at this.
- Okay, time to sing

874
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,300
happy birthday to the birthday girl.

875
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,383
Bridget?

876
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,123
Bridge?

877
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,393
Where's Bridget?

878
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,533
- Where's Derek?

879
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:12,022
(lips smacking)

880
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,330
Whoa, whoa, hey.
- Bridget, honey.

881
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,023
- Hey, break it up.
- Bridget, Bridget.

882
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:18,940
- Hey!
- Oh.

883
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,100
- Honey, you have guests inside.

884
00:42:33,124 --> 00:42:35,457
We'll talk about this later.

885
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:44,487
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

886
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,840
(Susannah laughing)
(Jesse laughing)

887
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,750
- Oh, my God, my little girl.

888
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,785
- Break it up?
(Jesse laughing)

889
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:57,670
- [Jesse] That the first
thing that came out.

890
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,930
- Well, nothing happened.

891
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,912
They're just trying to figure it all out.

892
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,473
- Yeah, well, I don't want 'em
to figure it out too quickly.

893
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,283
Oh, man.

894
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,930
- So, I see you invited Gina?

895
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,620
- Yeah, that introduction you made

896
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,493
was under false pretenses.

897
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,250
I thought she was a friend of yours?

898
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,540
- And now, she's a friend of yours.

899
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,840
It seems to be going okay.

900
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,763
- Just curious why you'd
care how it's going?

901
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,110
Why you practically
arranged the whole thing?

902
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,660
- I just want you to be happy.

903
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:43,075
- Well, can't argue with that.

904
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:51,129
(dogs barking)

905
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,873
- Hi.
- Hey.

906
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,530
- So, you wanna talk about what happened

907
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,363
at your birthday party?

908
00:43:59,363 --> 00:44:00,196
- No.

909
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,403
- You have anything you wanna ask me?

910
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:09,960
(Bridget chuckling)

911
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,643
- Um.
(Susannah sighs)

912
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,695
- Why don't you tell me about Derek?

913
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:18,528
- Okay.

914
00:44:19,453 --> 00:44:21,746
I mean, I really like him a lot.

915
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:23,046
And he's great to talk to.

916
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:26,133
When he's actually talking.

917
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,080
- How do you feel when you're with him?

918
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,913
- I feel good.

919
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:34,193
You know, kinda safe.

920
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:38,440
Which is weird because
he's really insecure

921
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,504
and his family's a mess.

922
00:44:40,504 --> 00:44:42,110
I mean, he doesn't even live here.

923
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,350
- But none of that matters.

924
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,553
- No.
- Mm mm.

925
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:51,870
- It just, I don't know
if sex is like love

926
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,183
or if it's just something
you do to get outta the way.

927
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,140
You know, with both of our
parents split up and everything,

928
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,210
we kind of wonder, you know,

929
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,260
can people actually make it work anymore?

930
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,107
Not that I wanna marry Derek or anything.

931
00:45:06,107 --> 00:45:08,970
- Oh, no, no, we're just
talking about the sex part.

932
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,183
- Mm.
- Uh huh, okay.

933
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,203
Well, obviously I think you should wait.

934
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,953
Take your time.

935
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,663
It's a really big step, honey.

936
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,680
And I'm just old fashioned enough to think

937
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,210
that love comes first and then the sex.

938
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,322
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

939
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:40,423
- Good.
(Susannah giggling)

940
00:45:40,423 --> 00:45:43,006
(gentle music)

941
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,493
(birds chirping)

942
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:06,865
(somber music)

943
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,093
- Hi, I'm Gina.

944
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:15,687
I'm a photojournalist, I'm a size one,

945
00:46:15,687 --> 00:46:18,908
and your ex-wife just handed
me to you on a silver platter.

946
00:46:18,908 --> 00:46:21,349
(Susannah sighs)

947
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,599
Oh, God, I'm such an idiot.

948
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:29,481
(light music)

949
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:18,679
(birds chirping)

950
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:21,362
- So, is living out here as
bad as you thought it would be?

951
00:47:21,362 --> 00:47:23,231
- At least gramps has a satellite dish.

952
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:24,064
- Yeah, right.

953
00:47:24,064 --> 00:47:27,400
Everybody comes to Alaska
so they can can five HBOs.

954
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,390
- [Derek] Wow, this is amazing.

955
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:33,991
- [Bridget] Yeah, I guess living in Alaska

956
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,842
does have some good parts.

957
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:37,380
- [Derek] This is pretty cool.

958
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,353
It's better than Hollywood
Boulevard, even Venice Beach.

959
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,477
I guess I could see how
you could stand it up here.

960
00:47:47,722 --> 00:47:49,943
(water splashing)

961
00:47:49,943 --> 00:47:53,276
(fishing reel clicking)

962
00:47:57,003 --> 00:47:59,110
- So, you want it to
move really naturally,

963
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,943
so the fish just thinks that

964
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,021
it's a fly lazying in the water.

965
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:03,650
All right?
- Okay.

966
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,511
- [Sam] You're doing good.

967
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:06,594
You're doing really good.

968
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:17,489
(family laughing)

969
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:19,021
- Everything all right?

970
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,104
- [Burt] Who caught this?

971
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:23,849
- Yeah?

972
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:25,516
Not bad.
- Thank you.

973
00:48:32,169 --> 00:48:35,420
- [Bridget] So, Dad, how
come Gina had to go back?

974
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,330
- Well, she does have a job, you know,

975
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,740
outside of entertaining you guys.

976
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,323
- But she's coming back, right?

977
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,920
- I take it that means you like her?

978
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,710
- Of course we do, Dad.

979
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,957
So what's the scoop?

980
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:55,040
- The scoop is Gina's fantastic.

981
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,563
You bloodhounds can call off the search.

982
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,520
- And then, Dad said we
could call off the search.

983
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,383
Gina's the one.

984
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,163
- Really?
- Mm hm.

985
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:08,916
- [Susannah] Wow.

986
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:15,399
Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.

987
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,643
- You okay, Mom?
- Yeah.

988
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,889
Yeah, I'm fine.

989
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,083
Hi.
- Hi.

990
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,823
- So, what happened with Gina?

991
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,100
- [Bridget] Oh, we had a great weekend

992
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,970
and then she had to leave for her job.

993
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,790
- Great, so your dad likes her, hm?

994
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:37,913
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

995
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,799
- Mom, are you jealous?

996
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:44,180
(Susannah gasps)
- No.

997
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,090
No, I'm not jealous.

998
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,900
I just, you know, I hear she's the one.

999
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,403
So, obviously I'm gonna be curious.

1000
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:55,550
- Well, he has fun with her,
but beyond that, I don't know.

1001
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,530
- Okay.

1002
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,759
Good night, honey.
- Night.

1003
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:04,287
(soft music)

1004
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:05,981
- [Jesse] Are you sure there's
no way I can stop this?

1005
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:07,491
I mean, this is harassment.

1006
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:08,324
- We have to give it to you.

1007
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,317
What you do with it
from there is up to you.

1008
00:50:14,162 --> 00:50:16,662
(light music)

1009
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:29,376
(mail thudding)

1010
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:42,542
(light music)

1011
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:52,003
- [Susannah] "Dear Bachelor of the Month,

1012
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,950
I'll start out by
admitting that I'm already

1013
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,040
embarrassed about writing this letter.

1014
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,030
But you'll never guess exactly why.

1015
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,920
Something in your bio really
touched a chord in me.

1016
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,443
I'm also divorced with three kids.

1017
00:51:05,443 --> 00:51:07,720
I love what the article said
about you never giving up

1018
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,063
on your dream of building
a ranch in paradise.

1019
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,440
My husband and I shared some

1020
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,620
pretty amazing dreams at the start.

1021
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,840
You seem to be proof
that people can move on.

1022
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,060
You've made your dream a reality.

1023
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,820
That gives me hope.

1024
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,597
Take care, Sarah Jennings."

1025
00:51:32,191 --> 00:51:34,691
(light music)

1026
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:50,370
- [Jesse] "Dear Sarah,
I'll start by saying

1027
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,191
that you're the first
woman I've replied to since

1028
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,358
the 'Alaska Love' article was published.

1029
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:57,400
And it's not just because
you're the first sane one.

1030
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,880
I don't really know how these things work.

1031
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,647
Your words struck a chord in me too.

1032
00:52:02,647 --> 00:52:05,170
You really seem to understand the pure joy

1033
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,413
I get from what I do.

1034
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:09,901
That the picture on the
cover isn't a gimmick.

1035
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,140
I may not be making a fortune,

1036
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,083
but I'm living my dream everyday.

1037
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,603
Sincerely, Jesse Stanton.

1038
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,929
P.S., I have some regrets
about my past as well,

1039
00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:24,679
it's good to know I'm not alone."

1040
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:28,989
(light music)

1041
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:32,097
- Oh, hey, Mom.

1042
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:33,169
- Hi, honey.

1043
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:34,417
- What are you reading?

1044
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,250
- Nothing.

1045
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:37,682
- Okay.

1046
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:42,460
(light music)

1047
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,410
- [Bridget] "Dear Jesse,
thank you for the reply.

1048
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,053
If I'm truly the only one, I'm flattered.

1049
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,180
And it's not such a miracle

1050
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,710
that I can tell what you really like.

1051
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,320
I can see the integrity in you.

1052
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,370
The love you feel for
your family and friends.

1053
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,660
When you said, 'I may
not be making a fortune,

1054
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,480
but I'm living my dream every day,'

1055
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,860
it made me wonder if maybe

1056
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,560
I gave up on my dream too quickly.

1057
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,720
Okay, I'm gonna stop before
I really embarrass myself.

1058
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,337
Take care, Sarah."

1059
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:19,510
- [Burt] What's wrong?

1060
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,150
(Jesse sighs)

1061
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,130
- I've been exchanging letters
with this woman, Sarah.

1062
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,573
- Cool, you wrote one back?

1063
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,100
Must be something special.

1064
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,100
Why don't you see this one?

1065
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,480
- I don't know.

1066
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,097
- Well, I think I do.

1067
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:53,480
And it's got nothing to do
with this Sarah or even Gina,

1068
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,543
as nice as she is.

1069
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,760
You got another woman
on your mind, Susannah.

1070
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,067
You still love her.

1071
00:54:01,236 --> 00:54:02,636
Why don't you just admit it?

1072
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,520
I've been watching the two
of you and I don't get it.

1073
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,050
Of course, I didn't get why you
broke up in the first place,

1074
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,330
but all the signs are there.

1075
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,000
At Bridget's party, I
thought the two of you

1076
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,020
were gonna sneak away and make out.

1077
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,950
- Well, Susannah was my
life for a long time.

1078
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,720
You see, that's the point though.

1079
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,793
She's my past.

1080
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,763
I think Gina's my future.

1081
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:29,760
(Burt sighs)

1082
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,570
- Well, if you were happy
with that arrangement,

1083
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,200
why are we having this conversation?

1084
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,033
- We're not.

1085
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,263
This never happened.

1086
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:44,996
(dog barking)

1087
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:50,252
(Sam sighs)

1088
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,750
(bag rustling)

1089
00:55:10,037 --> 00:55:12,954
(computer beeping)

1090
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:31,110
- [Bridget] "Dear Jesse,
I've been trying to

1091
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,090
get you out of my head, but
it isn't working very well.

1092
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,420
If you're having the same
problem, meet me for lunch at

1093
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,240
Jenny's Cafe in Anchorage on
Tuesday the 10th at 1:00 p.m."

1094
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,740

They said it was unwinnable.

1109
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,750
I won it!
- Congratulations.

1110
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,580
- Oh, of course you know what that means.

1111
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,310
I've gotta head back
to Boston pretty soon.

1112
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,530
But hey, Boston's a great town.

1113
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,600
We got museums, we got restaurants,

1114
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,900
you name it, we've got it.

1115
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,370
I want you to come with me.

1116
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,523
Think about it.

1117
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,180
You can hop on a train and be in New York

1118
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,720
or D.C. in a couple hours.

1119
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,420
We got schools, your kids would love it.

1120
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,020
Some of the best schools
in the world there.

1121
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,923
- Stephen, my whole life is here.

1122
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,696
- Well, you can make your
life anywhere you want.

1123
00:58:05,576 --> 00:58:07,050
You can.

1124
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,280
I'm crazy about you.

1125
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,563
You know that.

1126
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,793
- Stephen, I, I can't.

1127
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,273
I'm sorry.

1128
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,280
- Well, I can't say it
comes as a total shock.

1129
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,113
I mean...

1130
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,730
Maybe I should've advertised
in that magazine too.

1131
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,163
- Ugh, this has nothing
to do with my husband.

1132
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,760
- Ex-husband, isn't it?

1133
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,010
Well, this sure isn't how
I saw this day ending.

1134
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,183
- I'm sorry.

1135
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,860
- We need to talk.

1136
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,040
- Do you mind knocking please?

1137
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,180
- Mom has been writing letters

1138
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,193
to dad pretending to be someone else.

1139
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,240
- Yeah right.

1140
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,620
- No, no, no, I saw the letters

1141
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,150
and I followed her yesterday.

1142
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,610
She arranged a lunch I guess to tell him,

1143
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,360
and then just bailed on him.

1144
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,070
- Well, why would she
do something like that?

1145
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,210
- Because we screwed up.

1146
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,713
- Mom still loves Dad.

1147
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:13,340
- So, you mean we set Dad
up with some new girlfriend

1148
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,561
when we could've been
setting him up with Mom?

1149
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:18,060
- Do you guys even watch your
parents when they're together?

1150
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,910
Of course they're still in love.

1151
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,180
My parents, not in love.

1152
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,783
The only problem is your
parents happen to be divorced.

1153
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:30,413
- Oh, okay, well, maybe it's not too late.

1154
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:32,560
I mean, and Dad, he likes Gina,

1155
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,853
but there might still be time.

1156
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,733
- Time for what?

1157
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:41,540
(light music)

1158
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,850
So, Gina, you really like our dad, huh?

1159
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,460
- [Gina] Yeah, I do.

1160
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,223
- Has he told you about
his little problem?

1161
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:51,913
- [Gina] What's his little problem?

1162
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,910
- He has six toes on each foot.

1163
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,330
- Oh, really?
- No, seriously.

1164
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,440
It's some genetic thing.

1165
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,380
I mean, none of us got it,
but if he has any more kids

1166
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,137
he could pass it on to them.

1167
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:04,210
- [Gina] Oh.

1168
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,540
- So, Gina was saying her
whole family lives in Chicago.

1169
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,060
Brothers and sisters, everyone.

1170
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,200
They sound pretty close.

1171
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,550
You know, I bet she'd
have a hard time leaving.

1172
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,283
- Well, your mom left her
family behind in Seattle.

1173
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,300
You know, sometimes a woman
wants some independence.

1174
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,620
You know, so she can
start a family of her own.

1175
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,020
- [Bridget] Yeah, but that was mom.

1176
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,850
She's a really independent person.

1177
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,000
- Yeah, Gina doesn't really
seem like the independent type.

1178
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,710
- No.
- Yeah, being a freelance

1179
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,680
photographer and traveling
all over the world alone

1180
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,670
is a sign a real dependent personality.

1181
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,413
- Sometimes he'll just go into
the woods for like a year.

1182
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,360
He says it helps him think.

1183
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,580
- Yeah, Dad doesn't take
clean clothes or anything.

1184
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,530
He says the experience needs to be pure,

1185
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:54,670
and he'll only eat what he
can kill with his bare hands.

1186
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:55,867
You know, when he comes
back he smells really bad,

1187
01:00:55,867 --> 01:00:59,190
and he's got a beard so thick
he almost looks like Bigfoot.

1188
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,770
- Hm.
- Yeah, for a while,

1189
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,240
we thought he was one of those guys

1190
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,360
who keeps a stock of guns.

1191
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,258
- [Sam] Or the Unabomber.

1192
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:08,048
- [Bridget] Well, would
you ever wanna marry

1193
01:01:08,048 --> 01:01:08,936
someone like that?

1194
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,103
- Oh, sweetie.

1195
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,757
Look, if I ever wanted
to get married again,

1196
01:01:12,757 --> 01:01:15,487
you'll be the first to know, okay?

1197
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:16,815
Well, maybe the second.

1198
01:01:16,815 --> 01:01:18,950
- I was just thinking because I think

1199
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,597
she's gonna marry Stephen.

1200
01:01:20,597 --> 01:01:22,690
You see the way she
looks at him don't you?

1201
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,090
- Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

1202
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:28,710
(wood thudding)

1203
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:32,110
- Well, your mom's a big girl.

1204
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,393
She deserves to be happy.

1205
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,783
- Yeah, she does.

1206
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,146
- You told him what?

1207
01:01:39,146 --> 01:01:41,520
- But mom broke up with Stephen.

1208
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,063
- Yeah, but she also
told us not to tell dad.

1209
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,840
Which means she did it
because she still loves him.

1210
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,120
- Wait a minute, how does that
give us permission to lie?

1211
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,640
- Oh, come on, Sam, what Dad
doesn't know won't hurt him.

1212
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,193
Anyways, all is fair in love and war.

1213
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:57,944
- So, I'm hiking along with these guys

1214
01:01:57,944 --> 01:01:59,750
a group out of San Diego.

1215
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,690
I had done a hike with them I don't know,

1216
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:06,108
about four years before
that and it was July, right?

1217
01:02:06,108 --> 01:02:11,108
And they're hiking along
in tank tops and t-shirts.

1218
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,640
I mean, they have absolutely no idea

1219
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:18,540
that it goes below freezing after dark.

1220
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,958
Why, why, why are you staring at my feet?

1221
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:25,791
- I'm not.

1222
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:31,042
(door slamming)

1223
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:36,040
- Okay, who's idea was it to
tell Gina that I had 12 toes?

1224
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,009
- Sam, I told you not to use that one.

1225
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:41,680
- Yeah, but Kyle's dad has
six toes on his left foot.

1226
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,059
I mean, it's not like it's not possible.

1227
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,389
- Okay, that is the stupidest-
- You told me I could do

1228
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:45,464
whatever I wanted to.
- Okay, hey, hey, hey,

1229
01:02:45,464 --> 01:02:48,190
hey, hey, hey, hey!

1230
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,960
I know what you're trying
to do here, so stop it.

1231
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,793
Okay?

1232
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,640
I thought you guys liked Gina?

1233
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,210
All right, it doesn't matter.

1234
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,710
Since I am being
undermined in my own home,

1235
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,140
I'm gonna make it up to
her and I'm gonna take her

1236
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,090
to the Lancaster for the weekend.

1237
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,630
I didn't need your interference before,

1238
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:09,423
and I certainly don't need it now.

1239
01:03:11,002 --> 01:03:11,860
(door slamming)

1240
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:13,060
- Good one, Sam.

1241
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,883
- But-
- 12 toes.

1242
01:03:15,844 --> 01:03:18,677
(muffled talking)

1243
01:03:19,804 --> 01:03:21,603
- Your waiter'll be right with you.

1244
01:03:21,603 --> 01:03:23,524
Hi, guys, you hungry?

1245
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:24,420
- Oh, wow, you're busy.

1246
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,500
- We're a little busy today, yeah.

1247
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,020
So, why don't you just,
I think there's a table.

1248
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,940
Yeah, just opened up over there.

1249
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,260
- Okay.
- I can't join you today

1250
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,473
though, sorry.
- That's okay.

1251
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,543
- Suze, Suze?

1252
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,109
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry,

1253
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:44,520
I know you're crazy right now.

1254
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,543
I gotta know this.

1255
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:49,993
Is it you?

1256
01:03:51,564 --> 01:03:53,345
- Is what me?
- Susannah, two glasses

1257
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:55,060
of Chardonnay, table seven.
- Is it?

1258
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,190
Okay, it's, it's busy.

1259
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,930
Honestly, forget it.
- No, no, what?

1260
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,763
What's the matter?

1261
01:03:59,763 --> 01:04:00,650
- The kids are just messing around.

1262
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,483
It's all right.

1263
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:07,900
While I have you though, could
you take 'em this weekend?

1264
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,720
Gina and I, we're gonna spend some time,

1265
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,788
you know, alone together.
- Oh.

1266
01:04:13,788 --> 01:04:16,000
- Yeah, she read about the Lancaster Hotel

1267
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,833
in some tour book.

1268
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,303
Now, so got her heart set on going there.

1269
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,463
- Yeah, I can take the kids.

1270
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:29,950
- Susannah, we're outta
mushrooms for the special.

1271
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,850
What should we do?

1272
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:35,983
What did I do?

1273
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,849
(birds chirping)

1274
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:49,300
- Okay, cough it up.

1275
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,233
What's bugging ya?

1276
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:54,773
- Jesse's taking Gina to the Lancaster.

1277
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,750
- So?

1278
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,440
They have been dating
for a while you know?

1279
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,000
- No, you don't understand.

1280
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,670
The Lancaster is where we were supposed

1281
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,620
to go two years ago on our anniversary.

1282
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,290
I had this beautiful romantic
trip to the city planned

1283
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:11,410
and then he just canceled
at the last minute.

1284
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,203
He had to lead some big corporate retreat.

1285
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,570
You know, when this whole thing
started with the magazine,

1286
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,853
I thought it was kinda funny.

1287
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:28,247
Then I got curious, so
I wrote him a letter.

1288
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:43,185
- Well, (sighs).

1289
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:47,020
You're jealous, honey.
(Susannah sighs)

1290
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,160
You're the only woman
Jesse's been interested in

1291
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,890
for a very long time.

1292
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:53,033
This was, this was inevitable.

1293
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,320
Now, you gotta just figure out

1294
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,380
if it's because you don't
wanna see him with anyone else

1295
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:02,913
or you really want him back for yourself.

1296
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,570
I better get back in there.

1297
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:15,749
(birds chirping)

1298
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,040
(smooth jazz music)

1299
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,150
- This is amazing.

1300
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,470
You know, apparently this
guy, Jacob Lancaster,

1301
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,500
made his fortune in gold
at the turn of the century.

1302
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,130
And he built this to lure his

1303
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,830
fiancee away from New York City.

1304
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,210
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1305
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:38,160
- Did it work?
- Indeed it did.

1306
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,010
They were together for
43 years blissfully.

1307
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:46,415
Do you realize that tonight
is our one month anniversary?

1308
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:48,530
I don't know if you intended that or not,

1309
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:49,680
but it's awfully sweet.

1310
01:06:50,657 --> 01:06:53,657
(smooth jazz music)

1311
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:18,617
What?

1312
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,610
(Jesse scoffs)

1313
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:21,943
- I kinda did a bad thing.

1314
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:29,276
Not intentionally or anything,
but I just don't think

1315
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:31,526
I'm really gonna be able
to enjoy being here.

1316
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,100
- Am I the part that you're not enjoying?

1317
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,803
- No, no, no, no, it's not that.

1318
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:43,351
- Um, Jesse, I know that you like me.

1319
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,390
Maybe you're just not ready for this.

1320
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:50,547
- Well, it takes time.

1321
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:52,733
- I think you know I'm
willing to put that time in.

1322
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:56,763
Or we could just be friends.

1323
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:00,173
I kinda wanna know now.

1324
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:11,547
Maybe we should cut this weekend short.

1325
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,813
- [Bridget] So, Mom,
you thinking about Dad?

1326
01:08:21,825 --> 01:08:23,677
- I wasn't until now.

1327
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:25,592
- You sure?

1328
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,530
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1329
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:30,363
Why?

1330
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,587
- Mom, we know it was you.

1331
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:37,967
- You know what was me?

1332
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,683
- The letters.

1333
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,493
- What letters?

1334
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,973
- To Dad.

1335
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,383
- From Sarah.

1336
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,713
Mom, I read the letters in your computer.

1337
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,123
And I followed you the
other day to the cafe.

1338
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,469
(Susannah sighs)

1339
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:16,840
(Susannah chuckling)

1340
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,923
- Okay, I wrote your dad some letters.

1341
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,570
- You still love him.

1342
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:24,843
Don't you?

1343
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,850
- Yes, of course I still love him.

1344
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:28,823
He's your father.

1345
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,303
- You know what we mean, Mom.

1346
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:36,149
(Susannah sighs)

1347
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,580
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

1348
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:43,388
(somber music)

1349
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,257
But you know what?

1350
01:09:46,257 --> 01:09:49,543
Your dad and I could not make
our lives compatible before,

1351
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,190
so what makes you think it's gonna be

1352
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:53,390
any different this time?

1353
01:09:58,788 --> 01:09:59,621
(birds chirping)

1354
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:01,030
- [Jesse] She doesn't
wanna give up her job

1355
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,770
or at least adjust it for me, you know?

1356
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,180
- That river down there supplies

1357
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,140
some of the drinking water for Anchorage.

1358
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,100
- Something Suze could never do.

1359
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,140
- Could never do?

1360
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,610
Jess, she did it for 15
years while you were off

1361
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:12,790
blazing trails and rafting and fishing.

1362
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,550
- She's the one who
left our marriage, Burt.

1363
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:15,610
- Yeah, well, you're the one

1364
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,090
that didn't give her much of a choice.

1365
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,140
When you get down there,

1366
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,487
throw away that fancy bottled
water and fill up with it.

1367
01:10:20,487 --> 01:10:22,890
That's the best you'll ever taste.

1368
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,910
- We tried to, we tried to talk,

1369
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:27,320
but we just always messed it up.

1370
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,220
- Maybe you should've written it down.

1371
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:33,333
(light music)

1372
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:38,271
- I think these letters are from Suze.

1373
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,410
Now, you read that part
about following your dreams.

1374
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,100
Susannah is the only who has
ever understood me like that.

1375
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,260
- I don't know, maybe you're right.

1376
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,270
- Why would lie about it?

1377
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,870
She hates lying.

1378
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,800
And why did she stand
me up at the restaurant?

1379
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,880
- Could be she chickened out.

1380
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,093
That'd be perfectly understandable.

1381
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:55,016
- I don't know, I think she's
doing it to mess with my head.

1382
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:56,990
What if, what if she's the one that tried

1383
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:58,050
to get the kids to break up me and Gina?

1384
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,230
- Oh, give me a break.

1385
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,980
Your kids don't need any help
to think up stupid ideas.

1386
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,173
- That's true.

1387
01:11:05,902 --> 01:11:07,344
(Jesse groaning)

1388
01:11:07,344 --> 01:11:08,177
I don't know, Burt.

1389
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:10,205
I think maybe I just need
to sit down face-to-face

1390
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:11,853
with her and have a
chat with her you know?

1391
01:11:11,853 --> 01:11:13,967
- Face-to-face, the two of you?

1392
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,720
Well, it's worth a shot.

1393
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:23,073
(Susannah laughing)

1394
01:11:23,995 --> 01:11:25,570
- Also, listen to this.

1395
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,113
Bridget wants to become a vegetarian now.

1396
01:11:28,113 --> 01:11:29,360
- I know, I heard.

1397
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,380
- Yeah, I think that's Derek's influence.

1398
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,590
- Oh, she's gonna be so
crushed when he goes back home.

1399
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,003
- Ah, well, maybe not.

1400
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,603
- What?

1401
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,163
- I invited him back next summer
to work for me if he wants.

1402
01:11:42,163 --> 01:11:44,330
- Are you crazy?
- I know, I don't know.

1403
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:45,960
He's a good kid, we just have to watch him

1404
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,340
a little more closely.
- So, is everything good

1405
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,580
or what?
- Oh, it's fabulous, Joey.

1406
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,413
- Lovely, thank you.
- It's great, Joey.

1407
01:11:49,413 --> 01:11:50,728
- Now, that's what I like to hear.

1408
01:11:50,728 --> 01:11:51,597
Look at this.

1409
01:11:51,597 --> 01:11:53,370
Got a face on her like an angel.

1410
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,620
I tell you, I must've
done something wrong.

1411
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,600
You know the last time
I seen you two in here?

1412
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,200
When your youngster was still a toddler.

1413
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,607
- Are you kidding?
- I'm not kidding you.

1414
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,010
You two enjoy yourself, huh?

1415
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,070
I'll talk to you later.

1416
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,903
- Thank you.

1417
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:11,520
So, you wanted to talk
to me about something?

1418
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,013
- Yeah, actually.

1419
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:19,650
(Susannah sighs)

1420
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,123
Remember we used to have
those long talks in school?

1421
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,450
About the chances of meeting
your true love in college,

1422
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,210
and the chances of there being only one?

1423
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,150
- Mm hm, yes.

1424
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:32,200
And we oh so logically
came to the conclusion

1425
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,020
that there couldn't possibly be

1426
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,797
just one right person for you.

1427
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,290
- You still believe that?

1428
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,157
- Well, we better believe it.

1429
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,711
Otherwise we'll end up pretty lonely.

1430
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:50,294
(gentle music)

1431
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:52,192
- Okay.

1432
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,830
So, listen, I wanna read you something.

1433
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,763
I've been getting these letters.

1434
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,120
Yeah, it's gonna sound like
one of those stupid things

1435
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,892
in those romance novels
my mom used to read.

1436
01:13:06,892 --> 01:13:09,550
Here.

1437
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:11,600
These letters are from this woman that...

1438
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,243
She just seems to get me somehow.

1439
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,132
Okay, where's that part?

1440
01:13:19,132 --> 01:13:21,001
Is this the one?

1441
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:21,834
Yeah.

1442
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,030
"When you said, 'I may
not be making a fortune,

1443
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,880
but I'm living my dream everyday,'

1444
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,010
it made me wonder if maybe

1445
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:31,827
I gave up on my dream too quickly."

1446
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:36,875
I don't really know how
to read into this further.

1447
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,042
I worry still.

1448
01:13:39,637 --> 01:13:42,220
(gentle music)

1449
01:13:51,655 --> 01:13:52,905
Second chances.

1450
01:13:54,905 --> 01:13:57,822
(glasses clinking)

1451
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:08,372
- Yeah, it was nice.

1452
01:14:09,484 --> 01:14:11,055
- [Jesse] It was.

1453
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:12,055
It was nice.

1454
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:18,623
(Susannah sighs)

1455
01:14:20,345 --> 01:14:22,845
(Jesse sighs)

1456
01:14:23,785 --> 01:14:25,185
- You have a plane to catch.

1457
01:14:27,473 --> 01:14:28,973
- Yeah, it's okay.

1458
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:32,842
I know the pilot.

1459
01:14:35,384 --> 01:14:38,384
(Susannah laughing)

1460
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:40,462
Good night.

1461
01:14:42,962 --> 01:14:44,045
- Good night.

1462
01:14:50,242 --> 01:14:52,825
(gentle music)

1463
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,882
- I need, I need my jacket.

1464
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,480
- Ah.
(Jesse laughing)

1465
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,903
(gentle music)

1466
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:49,562
(soft chiming)

1467
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:54,862
(water splashing)

1468
01:15:54,862 --> 01:15:56,494
- [Bridget] Isn't the sky gorgeous?

1469
01:15:56,494 --> 01:15:59,153
- Yeah, in L.A., you can't see the sky.

1470
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:02,652
The city just has this pink
haze over it every night.

1471
01:16:02,652 --> 01:16:03,952
- Why pink?

1472
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:05,202
- I don't know.

1473
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,698
- How about every night at 9:30,

1474
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,510
we'll both go outside and
we'll look at the moon,

1475
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:19,090
and then we'll be
thinking about each other.

1476
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:21,220
- Bridge, for a girl who
struggles everyday to look cool,

1477
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,672
that was pretty dorky.

1478
01:16:22,672 --> 01:16:25,370
(both giggling)

1479
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,704
Why don't we just use the internet?

1480
01:16:27,704 --> 01:16:28,537
- Okay.

1481
01:16:45,964 --> 01:16:48,714
(birds chirping)

1482
01:16:54,015 --> 01:16:56,515
(light music)

1483
01:17:07,643 --> 01:17:08,976
Mom, we're home.

1484
01:17:09,905 --> 01:17:11,778
- Mom?
- Wake up!

1485
01:17:11,778 --> 01:17:13,791
- Ow, jeez.
(Susannah hushes)

1486
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:14,624
- What do you mean (hushes)?

1487
01:17:14,624 --> 01:17:15,582
What?
- The kids are home.

1488
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:16,643
- Mom?

1489
01:17:16,643 --> 01:17:17,943
It's 10 o'clock.

1490
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,953
Mom is so busted if she's not up yet.

1491
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:24,654
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

1492
01:17:24,654 --> 01:17:25,487
- What do you mean you don't know?

1493
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:26,556
What am I supposed to do?

1494
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:27,410
- You never let us sleep past-

1495
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:30,114
- Mom, it's 10:00-
- Here we go.

1496
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:33,783
(Susannah laughing)

1497
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:34,783
- Dad?
- Hey.

1498
01:17:38,497 --> 01:17:40,636
- We're gonna go get some donuts.

1499
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:41,469
- No, no, no.
- No, honey.

1500
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:43,100
You don't need to go.
- It's okay.

1501
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,857
- I told you guys.

1502
01:17:44,857 --> 01:17:49,857
- Mom, Dad, are you really back together?

1503
01:17:50,537 --> 01:17:53,037
(light music)

1504
01:17:58,756 --> 01:18:01,756
(Susannah laughing)

1505
01:18:04,116 --> 01:18:05,033
Dad's home.

1506
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:08,903
- Oh, silly.
- Let's go, Mom.

1507
01:18:08,903 --> 01:18:10,479
- Okay, all right.

1508
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,330
- I can't believe this.
- This is so cool.

1509
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,770
- Well, I knew this was gonna happen.

1510
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,550
Ever since Jesse told me he couldn't sleep

1511
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:17,383
'cause he was staying up-
- Hey, Burt, Burt.

1512
01:18:17,383 --> 01:18:18,216
- All night reading your letters.

1513
01:18:18,216 --> 01:18:20,073
- Burt.
- My letters?

1514
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:22,975
What...

1515
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,050
You knew last night those
letters were from me?

1516
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:29,367
- No, no, no, Suze.
- Jesse, what are you doing?

1517
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:31,000
- No, no, no, no, no, it's not like that.

1518
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,320
- What did you just wanna make me squirm?

1519
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,350
Is that what's going on?
- Okay, hang on a sec.

1520
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,230
- What for your personal entertainment?

1521
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:35,690
- No, listen, wait a minute!

1522
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,920
You're the one writing letters and putting

1523
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,440
somebody else's name on the bottom.

1524
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,880
You're the only one getting to play games?

1525
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,613
Suze, come on, give me a break here.

1526
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:42,446
- I think you should leave.
- Suze.

1527
01:18:42,446 --> 01:18:44,330
- Now, now!
- Suze.

1528
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,250
- Mom, please, Mom.
- No, Mom, this isn't fair.

1529
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,420
- No, everybody needs
to get out of this room,

1530
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,540
and you need to get dressed.

1531
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:50,895
I want everybody out!

1532
01:18:50,895 --> 01:18:53,478
(somber music)

1533
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,453
- Jess.
- No, I'm not talkin' to you.

1534
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:07,190
- How was I supposed to know
you hadn't told her yet?

1535
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:08,940
- No, no, no, no, you don't just offer up

1536
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,880
random information in
a situation like that.

1537
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,230
I had things under control.

1538
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,140
- This is ridiculous.

1539
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,495
You're both adults, you wanna be-

1540
01:19:14,495 --> 01:19:16,540
(luggage thudding)
- I am just so angry!

1541
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,090
- [Josie] I don't see what the problem is?

1542
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,010
- The problem is he lied.

1543
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:22,373
- Yeah, well, so did you, Sarah.

1544
01:19:23,313 --> 01:19:24,900
(Josie laughing)

1545
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,330
- Whose side are you on?
- Oh, you two.

1546
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,810
You're both acting like second graders.

1547
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,680
Neither one of you wants to blink first

1548
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,130
in this stupid little game
you're playing, do ya?

1549
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:36,943
- What do you suggest I do?

1550
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,600
- What do you want to do?

1551
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,283
- [Announcer] Flight 232-

1552
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:43,610
- Okay, come on, Derek.

1553
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,467
We gotta go.
- Is now boarding.

1554
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:48,460
- I'll meet you inside, son.

1555
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,427
- Thanks, Gramp.

1556
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,013
- Jesse.

1557
01:19:55,009 --> 01:19:57,709
This isn't exactly the way
I planned to tell you this.

1558
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,870
But I'm thinking of retiring

1559
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,610
and moving Ellen and me into town.

1560
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:02,443
Maybe you should sell-
- What?

1561
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:04,040
- The ranch and do the same thing.

1562
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,920
It would be easier to run
your business from Anchorage.

1563
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,343
- Sell the ranch?

1564
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,470
Give up the dream I've
worked for my entire life?

1565
01:20:13,881 --> 01:20:17,190
- You want your wife back?
(somber music)

1566
01:20:21,436 --> 01:20:22,627
- [Josie] Okay, honey,
I'll see you tomorrow.

1567
01:20:22,627 --> 01:20:24,136
- Yeah.
- Just go outside a minute.

1568
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:26,235
- Bye.
- I'm driving you home.

1569
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:27,707
- Yeah?

1570
01:20:27,707 --> 01:20:30,290
(somber music)

1571
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,843
(keys jingling)

1572
01:20:53,326 --> 01:20:58,326
(fishing line whooshing)
(birds chirping)

1573
01:21:16,147 --> 01:21:16,980
- If any of you are interested,

1574
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:19,860
I've got an idea to get
mom and dad back together.

1575
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,880
- Yeah, like putting an article of dad

1576
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,670
in a personals magazine?

1577
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,440
- Give it up, Bridge, we tried.

1578
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,787
- No, they want this and you know it.

1579
01:21:27,856 --> 01:21:28,850
(Sam sighs)

1580
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,040
- All right, what were you thinking?

1581
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:33,120
- Okay, we can make a world
where they can both be happy.

1582
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,800
You know that service road
they've been building forever?

1583
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,683
Well, it's done.

1584
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:38,730
- I didn't think they'd ever finish that.

1585
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,650
- Well, now, you don't have
to fly all the way out there.

1586
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,310
And it's only like a 70
minute drive from Anchorage.

1587
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,897
It's still remote enough for dad,

1588
01:21:44,897 --> 01:21:47,697
but not so far outta the city
that mom's gonna go crazy.

1589
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:51,283
So, what do you think?

1590
01:21:51,283 --> 01:21:54,104
(light music)
- Hm.

1591
01:21:54,104 --> 01:21:55,590
- [Bridget] I think this
could really work this time.

1592
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,460
- Yeah, I think I've heard
that from you before.

1593
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,020
I mean, whenever we do what you tell us,

1594
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,080
we get grounded.
- Yeah, and mom and dad

1595
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,955
still end up mad at each other.

1596
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:05,790
- Well, fine then, we'll get grounded.

1597
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:06,733
'Cause I can tell all mom and dad

1598
01:22:06,733 --> 01:22:08,683
need is a push, a solution.

1599
01:22:09,535 --> 01:22:11,065
I think this plan could be it.

1600
01:22:11,065 --> 01:22:13,186
- Don't you kids think
you've done enough already?

1601
01:22:13,186 --> 01:22:15,614
- Yeah, your parents have been
pretty patient up until now,

1602
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:17,632
but I think they're
reaching a breaking point.

1603
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:18,853
- [Bridget] Come on, we
can't stop when we're ahead.

1604
01:22:18,853 --> 01:22:19,686
- No, she's right.

1605
01:22:19,686 --> 01:22:20,636
They're back together,
they just don't know

1606
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:21,523
that they're back together.

1607
01:22:21,523 --> 01:22:23,155
- Even if your idea could work,

1608
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:24,007
how could you get two people

1609
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:26,273
that stubborn to sit down and talk?

1610
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:30,340
- Good point.

1611
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,500
- I gotta go, the kids called.

1612
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,733
There's some emergency at the ranch.

1613
01:22:32,733 --> 01:22:34,340
I don't know how I'm gonna
get a flight in this late.

1614
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,170
Oh, boy.
- Take the new road.

1615
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:37,311
It's finally open.

1616
01:22:37,311 --> 01:22:38,784
- You got the candles, Bridge?

1617
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:40,504
- Yeah, they're over there.

1618
01:22:40,504 --> 01:22:41,337
- All right.

1619
01:22:41,337 --> 01:22:44,170
Hurry up with that letter, Hannah.

1620
01:22:45,912 --> 01:22:49,579
- Hannah, could you
grab an end for me here?

1621
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:53,704
How's that floor coming, Burt?

1622
01:22:53,704 --> 01:22:56,704
- [Burt] Oh, it's a thing of beauty.

1623
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,277
(soft music)

1624
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,563
- Oh, you missed a spot.

1625
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:07,063
(light music)

1626
01:23:12,283 --> 01:23:15,616
(plane engine rumbling)

1627
01:23:36,305 --> 01:23:38,722
(soft music)

1628
01:23:41,523 --> 01:23:43,106
- Don't say a word.

1629
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:55,251
(light joyous music)

1630
01:23:55,251 --> 01:23:57,451
- Welcome to the Stanton Ranch B and B,

1631
01:23:57,451 --> 01:23:59,697
where you can leave all your
worldly cares at the door.

1632
01:23:59,697 --> 01:24:01,960
- All my worldly cares, huh?

1633
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,210
- She read it in a book.

1634
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,760
We thought it was kinda catchy.

1635
01:24:06,651 --> 01:24:07,770
- You know, I think what you guys

1636
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:08,603
are doing is really special-

1637
01:24:08,603 --> 01:24:11,220
- Please step into our parlor room,

1638
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:14,830
where guests can mingle and
relax or simply read a book.

1639
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,110
Oh and don't forget to
sign our guest book.

1640
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,410
- And come into our dining room,

1641
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:21,782
where guests can enjoy
a delectable, delicious,

1642
01:24:21,782 --> 01:24:23,160
and elegant meal.

1643
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,220
- Prepared of course by
our master chef, Hannah.

1644
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:31,472
- Dinner will be served in 10 minutes.

1645
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:34,902
Would you like freshly
prepared appetizers?

1646
01:24:34,902 --> 01:24:36,112
Try one.

1647
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:37,977
(Susannah laughing)

1648
01:24:37,977 --> 01:24:41,842
- And if you'll join us
upstairs to the guest rooms.

1649
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:44,925
(light joyous music)

1650
01:24:48,693 --> 01:24:50,563
Um, this is the Kodiak Suite.

1651
01:24:53,892 --> 01:24:55,433
- This is our Alpine Suite.

1652
01:24:56,379 --> 01:24:57,993
- And this is the New Dawns
Suite, our finest culmination.

1653
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:03,385
(gentle music)

1654
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,917
So, can you picture it?

1655
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:15,960
And now that you can use the road,

1656
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,122
people can come from all over.

1657
01:25:18,122 --> 01:25:19,410
And I mean, a bed and
breakfast would be great

1658
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:20,780
for Dad's business.

1659
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:22,840
And Mom, think about the
restaurant you can make

1660
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,653
with the romantic setting.

1661
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:27,470
(door creaking)

1662
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:28,303
- What?

1663
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,893
What's going on?

1664
01:25:33,871 --> 01:25:35,423
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1665
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:43,480
Uh, the, the kids seem to think

1666
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:46,493
that we could turn this place into a,

1667
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,563
a full service B and B.

1668
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,093
- Together.

1669
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,020
- Why don't we go and swing on the swings.

1670
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,100
- Oh, no, no, that's okay.

1671
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,511
I'm just-
- Sam, let's go

1672
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:10,663
swing on the swings.
- Hey, ow, jeez.

1673
01:26:10,663 --> 01:26:12,330
- [Bridget] Hi, Dad.

1674
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,660
- A B and B, huh?

1675
01:26:26,362 --> 01:26:28,480
Well, it would take more than this.

1676
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:34,950
I mean, we'd need some renovation money.

1677
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:38,606
(gentle music)

1678
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:44,480
- Well, the restaurant...

1679
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:49,201
Well, it's worth quite a bit.

1680
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,191
- Yeah, I mean, it's been a good year.

1681
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:55,291
I've been able to just squirrel some away.

1682
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,307
What do you think?

1683
01:27:12,621 --> 01:27:13,704
- How's Gina?

1684
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:19,077
- Well, she got back from
her trip and she dumped me.

1685
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:22,517
She was too perky anyway.

1686
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,283
How's Sebastian?

1687
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:35,630
- We actually, we broke
up a couple weeks ago.

1688
01:27:39,174 --> 01:27:42,757
'Cause he was too (sighs).

1689
01:27:45,374 --> 01:27:46,541
He wasn't you.

1690
01:27:50,952 --> 01:27:52,035
- I love you.

1691
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:58,735
- Well, that's a relief
'cause I love you too.

1692
01:27:59,662 --> 01:28:02,245
(gentle music)

1693
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:08,760
- We're gathered today,
in the presence of family

1694
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,760
and friends to join in holy
matrimony Susannah and Jesse.

1695
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,300
Marriage is a sacred union.
(Jesse sighs)

1696
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,613
It is truly a journey.

1697
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:24,120
Jesse, do you take Susannah to love,

1698
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,070
honor and cherish forever?

1699
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,483
- I do.

1700
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,580
- Susannah, do you take Jesse to love,

1701
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,220
honor and cherish forever?

1702
01:28:36,129 --> 01:28:37,212
- Yeah, I do.

1703
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:42,747
- By the power vested in
me by the state of Alaska,

1704
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:47,608
I now pronounce you
husband and wife, again.

1705
01:28:47,608 --> 01:28:49,208
(both laughing)

1706
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:52,208
(family applauding)

1707
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:03,209
(gentle music)

1708
01:29:14,026 --> 01:29:16,526
(light music)

1709
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:07,206
(light chiming)
