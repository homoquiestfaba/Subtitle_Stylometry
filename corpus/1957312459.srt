00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,858
They don't need to hear about
earthworm droppings

175
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,593
at breakfast.

176
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,758
Go around.
Why do you always have to...

177
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,125
- [indistinct chatter]
- [gasps]

178
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,858
[Sean] Always go clockwise!
That's our new system!

179
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:55,392
Never mind.
This is getting cold.

180
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,725
And we can't afford
any bad reviews.

181
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,925
We can't go out there
wearing cranberry juice.

182
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,758
What would our guests think
of that?

183
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:09,626
Love, I hate to ask.

184
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,359
But would you mind taking this
to the gentleman in the corner?

185
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:14,959
All you have to do is set
the plate down on the table,

186
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,025
smile, and walk away.

187
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,025
Yeah, of course.

188
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,459
You?

189
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,192
Good morning to you as well.

190
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:33,159
You didn't spit in my food,
did you?

191
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,159
- What are you doing here?
- What does it look like?

192
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,492
- I'm a guest.
- In one of these rooms?

193
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,025
Yeah,
that's usually how it works.

194
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,326
Are you stalking me?

195
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,392
- No!
- I thought you might be.

196
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,959
I didn't buy that whole
"I'm not interested" bit.

197
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:46,025
I'm staying here, too.

198
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,526
- What, the Callahans
are your host family?

199
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,426
- Yeah.
- Oh. [chuckles]

200
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,992
Shouldn't you be at some
boujee hotel with your harem?

201
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,792
What are you talking about?
This is boujee.

202
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:58,025
It's posh. The cooking's great.
And the service is even better.

203
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,059
Usually.

204
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,192
I have to go to orientation,
so enjoy.

205
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,092
Well, I'll be staying here
for the next few months

206
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,159
while we film.
So, no sneaking up

207
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,459
- into my room, young lady.
- Ooh. Don't worry.

208
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:11,392
I'm not supposed to bother the
guests. Even if they bother me.

209
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,492
What do you have against me?

210
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,492
I am trying to stay focused...

211
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:20,758
and I just don't think
you're gonna help with that.

212
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:23,426
- And how would you know?
- I see the news.

213
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,959
Well, maybe things aren't always
as they seem.

214
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,326
I know your type.

215
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:30,959
I'll see you later, Frankey.

216
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,892
Hmm. It's Finley,
but good try.

217
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,292
Um...

218
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:44,092
Why is Beckett Rush
in the dining room?

219
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,326
What? No.

220
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,326
No, that's definitely him.

221
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,125
You can't tell anyone.

222
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,426
Beckett...
Becket Rush is in my house.

223
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,392
I'd never even heard of him
till yesterday.

224
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,125
Of course, you didn't.
You're such a dad.

225
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,392
He's only like, the biggest
movie star in the world.

226
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,192
She's got posters
of him in her room.

227
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:04,059
Ah, that's why I recognized him.

228
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,858
Nora, dear.

229
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,259
- [gasps]
- [glass shatter]

230
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,426
Do you have any jam
for the scones?

231
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:11,858
Yes, sure, love.

232
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,758
[Sean]
Just made it fresh yesterday.

233
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:16,059
Ah. Brilliant.
Cheers.

234
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:18,858
[Emma chuckling]

235
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,792
[gasping]

236
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,426
Your daughter has lost her mind.

237
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,526
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell her.

238
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,192
Now not a word.

239
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,159
We have promised him
to keep it quiet.

240
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,526
The whole town
is gonna find out.

241
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,758
Well, it's not gonna be
because of us.

242
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,459
We are going to give him
a place away from the press.

243
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,792
If they find out,
the B&B could be at risk.

244
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:40,159
We can't afford a bad review
from an international celebrity

245
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,492
right when we're starting out.

246
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,492
Oh, shite!

247
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:49,292
[whistle blows]

248
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:52,426
[indistinct chatter]

249
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,825
I heard the Heart Slayer
is staying at your B&B?

250
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,326
See, the whole town knows,
and I can't say a word.

251
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,192
Don't worry, Irish small towns
are good at keeping secrets.

252
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,758
The people here
won't let it out.

253
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:05,593
Yeah, and if they do,

254
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:07,792
my parents'll lose
their entire life savings,

255
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,392
and I'll end up in an orphanage.

256
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:12,825
Your mom is going to be washing
his sheets. How insane is that?

257
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,359
Not the first thing
that came to my mind, but yes.

258
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:19,092
Hey, maybe Beckett will ask you
to the dance.

259
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,259
Right. The hottest guy
in the whole world

260
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,192
is gonna break up
with Taylor Risdale.

261
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:24,758
Look me in the eye and say,

262
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,459
"Hey, Emma,
will you go out with me?"

263
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,192
No one has ever even
asked me to it.

264
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:32,959
Bull.
What's this dance?

265
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:35,092
It's the big town festival
that happens every autumn.

266
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,925
It's where all of our parents
fell in love. It's disgusting.

267
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,959
It's amazing.
The whole town comes out for it.

268
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,426
Outside, under the lights.

269
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,426
- It's so romantic.
- Or depressing.

270
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,526
[Emma] Guys are already
starting to ask.

271
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,359
Well, maybe this is your year.

272
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,858
Yeah, maybe.

273
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,226
Any lads you fancy yet?

274
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,326
It's just my first day.

275
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,725
Maybe Beckett will ask you.

276
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:03,459
I think he prefers
his snooty celebrity soirees.

277
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,025
Not really my type.

278
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,226
Dragons!

279
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,025
To the bottom lines.

280
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:13,292
[indistinct yelling]

281
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,059
Archers, at the ready!

282
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,159
Oriana!

283
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,359
My love!

284
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:22,092
Come with me, I'll protect you.

285
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,159
My bow!

286
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,492
Stay close.

287
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:32,825
[ominous music playing]

288
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,892
[indistinct yelling]

289
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,725
Hurry up, keep going.

290
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,959
If you save me, my father
might finally accept our love,

291
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,492
my one true knight.

292
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,492
Duck!

293
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:53,858
[grunts]

294
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:55,092
[horse neighs]

295
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:58,992
More dragons.

296
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,892
We have to go, now!

297
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,059
[screaming]

298
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:17,392
[dragon screeching]

299
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:25,758
I am Steele Markov,
son of Talagorn.

300
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,226
May this arrow be true,

301
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,159
and find
the heart of this beast.

302
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,125
[man] <i>Cut!</i>

303
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,758
Okay, guys, back to one.

304
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,959
[indistinct chatter]

305
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:40,125
How was that?
Did you feel it?

306
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,092
Yeah. Sure.

307
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,992
[Seamus] Beck. Beck.
Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.

308
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:47,825
How are you, man?
Okay yeah, everything good?

309
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,825
- Yeah.
- What the bloody hell was that?

310
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:50,559
Huh?

311
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,259
I just thought I'd try something
a little more subtle, you know?

312
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,959
Subtle? Can you amp it up, man?

313
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:57,326
- I can amp it up.
- Great. Okay, good.

314
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,892
Because, if not, my friend,
I am afraid,

315
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,292
we're going to have to kill off
your character.

316
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,259
I am joking.

317
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,259
[laughing]

318
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:12,092
I no serious.
I make a joke, used to feel.

319
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,825
Okay, he can do it, guys.

320
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,125
He's okay. Let's go.

321
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,492
He can do it, I think.

322
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:17,892
Back to one!

323
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,758
Take 17.

324
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:20,892
You okay?

325
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,359
- Yeah.
- All right, good.

326
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,292
Hey, listen, I heard
the studio is considering

327
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:26,459
a trilogy of Steele Markov
spin-off movies

328
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,892
for you and Taylor. So,
you'll finally be getting paid

329
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:31,192
what you're worth,
plus back end.

330
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:33,359
So, you know,
just give him what he wants.

331
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:35,359
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

332
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,925
Don't screw this up.

333
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,192
Okay, just give me some space.
Okay.

334
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,825
Yes, whatever you need.
Of course.

335
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,426
I'm here for you. All right.

336
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,892
Thanks.

337
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,426
[Seamus] <i>So one more like that,
please.</i>

338
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,758
[man] Do it again.

339
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,892
[crickets chirping]

340
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,259
[knock on door]

341
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,192
- It's just me.
- Oh, come in, Nora.

342
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:08,192
Finley, I'm sorry,
but we can't take you

343
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:09,792
to the Cliffs of Moher
this weekend.

344
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:12,858
Sean has to fix a heater
and re-tile a bathroom,

345
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,392
so I have to do the hosting
while he's working.

346
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:18,326
[Finley] Oh, that's...
yeah, that's okay.

347
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,959
[Nora] But I got you a bike down
at the shops today.

348
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,292
So, you can use that
to get around town at least.

349
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:24,426
[Finley]
Thank you. Yeah. No.

350
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,159
You know, we...
I have plenty of time

351
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,892
- to see the rest of the country.
- [Nora] Aye, plenty.

352
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,792
Listen, I was, um...

353
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:34,825
cleaning up in here
a few weeks ago,

354
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:36,125
getting the place ready for you.

355
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,426
And I found this
under the dresser.

356
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:42,326
It's Alex's journal
from when he was here.

357
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:46,159
I didn't pry,
or look or anything,

358
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,526
but maybe just a little.

359
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,825
Enough to see it's got
all his drawings and writings.

360
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,459
It's old-fashioned like.

361
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,825
Yeah, he was like that.

362
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,159
[Nora] I was gonna send it
to your mum, but...

363
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:03,426
then I just thought
I'd give it to you. I...

364
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,925
I wouldn't want it
to get lost in the post.

365
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:12,825
Thank you, Nora.
This is... amazing.

366
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,226
He was always working
on those drawings.

367
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,758
Now you can see all the things
he loved here.

368
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:28,992
Yeah, he was so at peace,
you know, when he...

369
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:30,825
when he came back, and...

370
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,359
he was just an amazing brother.

371
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,992
He was.

372
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:46,392
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up sad memories.

373
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,758
It's okay.

374
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,925
[dramatic music playing]

375
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:33,925
[upbeat music playing]

376
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,892
[Emma] Are you done yet?

377
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,825
I don't like dead bodies
near my feet.

378
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:56,025
Yeah, are there more crosses
like this around here?

379
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,092
Yeah, like everywhere.

380
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,159
Oh.

381
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,459
[violin music playing]

382
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,825
Oh, come on, Finley.

383
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:11,892
I think something
just touched me.

384
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:13,825
Yeah. I've got
to get practicing anyway.

385
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,359
Good. Let's go.

386
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:17,858
Run! It's no bother.
Oh, sorry about that.

387
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:20,159
Have a good day.
Come on, Finley.

388
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,192
[violin music playing]

389
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:25,725
Okay.

390
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,092
[knocks on door]

391
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,159
[Finley] Nora?
You can just come in.

392
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:46,892
What are you doing here?

393
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:49,025
You're pretty good
on that thing, you know.

394
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,426
You heard me?

395
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,925
[Beckett] Yeah,
you play like your personality.

396
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:55,825
And how is that?

397
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:57,792
Beautiful, but a bit stiff.

398
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:00,992
What are you doing
up here anyway?

399
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,426
- I'm about to ask you a favor.
- I'm about to say no.

400
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,025
And I'm about to ignore that.

401
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:07,059
I need some help
running my lines,

402
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,992
- like somebody to work off with.
- No.

403
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,259
How can you say no to this face?
Huh?

404
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,825
Oh, well, I am up-to-date
on all of my shots

405
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,326
and immune to everything.

406
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,526
- Come on, Frankie.
- It's Finley.

407
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,892
No wonder you don't
remember your lines.

408
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:24,892
Look...

409
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:29,492
Things have been tough on set.
and my scenes aren't going well.

410
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:33,059
Um... I'm in my head,
and I need something new

411
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:34,459
to break me out of it.

412
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,192
Yeah, I...
I know all about that.

413
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,858
Cool drawing.
Do you do this?

414
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:48,292
[Finley] No. Hey,
I did not say you could come in.

415
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,326
Why? Are all your deepest,
darkest secrets in there?

416
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,059
No, this is my brother's
from when he spent time here.

417
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:57,192
I just... I can't get
this cross out of my mind.

418
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:59,858
I mean, why would he write
my name at the bottom of this?

419
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:01,226
Have you seen this anywhere?

420
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:03,226
Yeah, there's crosses like that
all over the place.

421
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,192
No.
I need to find this one.

422
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:08,159
So why don't you just text him
and ask him where it is?

423
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,925
He's... dead.

424
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,159
Oh! Wow.

425
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,992
I'm sorry. I didn't...

426
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,992
I didn't know.

427
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:27,426
What happened?

428
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:30,526
I don't really talk about it.

429
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,892
Especially not with
Steele Markov, the heart slayer.

430
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:38,025
Well, I'd like to think
I'm a little bit more than that.

431
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,259
If you ever wanna talk,
I'm here.

432
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,725
Seriously.

433
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,892
Well, not here in this room,
exactly.

434
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,825
'Cause I'm not allowed in.

435
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,459
[both chuckles]

436
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:56,992
We could talk downstairs
or wherever you want.

437
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,526
Okay, let's go.

438
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,992
Where?

439
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,326
Run your lines.

440
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,526
Really?
'Cause we don't have to.

441
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,858
Come on,
before I change my mind.

442
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,092
Oriana, we must find a way.
Don't give up on us.

443
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,858
My father is the king.

444
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:21,259
He won't allow anything
to interfere with his conquest.

445
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:23,492
He's going to marry me off
to the Prince of Moor.

446
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:25,758
He'll kill you
if you get in the way.

447
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,992
Well, I'd rather die loving you
than live without you.

448
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,059
My heart can't handle
living a lie.

449
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,025
[laughs]

450
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,292
Come on.

451
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:35,492
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

452
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:37,925
- It's so bad.
- Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,892
Just give me a minute here.
I got to find it.

454
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:43,392
Right.

455
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,392
Okay...

456
00:24:56,392 --> 00:25:00,125
Oriana, we must find a way.
Don't give up on us.

457
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,192
I'm doing it to protect you.

458
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:06,125
My father is the king.

459
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,992
He won't let anyone
interfere with his conquest.

460
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,459
I'll find a way.

461
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:13,226
They're going to marry me off
to the Prince of Moor.

462
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:16,226
If you get in the way,
they'll kill you.

463
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:22,226
I'd rather die loving you
than live without you.

464
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,925
My heart can't handle
living a lie.

465
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:29,192
[dramatic music playing]

466
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:33,459
How was that?

467
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:35,326
Um...

468
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,925
that was...
that was great.

469
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:40,492
Uh, not stiff at all that time.

470
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,526
I need to...
I really... I need to go to bed.

471
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,159
I have class tomorrow, so...

472
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:48,059
Oh, that sounds amazing.

473
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:49,892
Yeah,
you should try it sometime.

474
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,226
I wish I could. I mean,
I'd love to go to college.

475
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,959
Yeah, well...

476
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,226
Hey, thanks for this.

477
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,426
Seriously, you were great.

478
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,925
Yeah, any time.

479
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:05,459
Night, Francine.

480
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:17,392
[woman] <i>As part
of your Irish studies class,</i>

481
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:19,259
<i>you must complete
a service project</i>

482
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:22,226
in order to see this country
from a different perspective.

483
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:25,825
So, each one of you will be
adopting a senior citizen

484
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:27,492
from one of the nearby
nursing homes.

485
00:26:27,526 --> 00:26:29,858
You will spend
at least 20 hours

486
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:31,259
with your new friend,

487
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:34,959
and you will do what you can
to serve them during this time.

488
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:36,392
At the end of the semester,

489
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:39,059
you will be expected
to turn in an essay

490
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:41,825
outlining what you have
learned from this experience.

491
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:44,725
[dramatic music playing]

492
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,892
[woman] So, thank you so much
for coming down to help.

493
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,025
You'll find her
right through here.

494
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,825
[Finley] Okay, thanks so much.

495
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,925
- Hello, Mrs. Sweeney.
- Get out.

496
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,992
Oh, I'm Finely Sinclair.

497
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,459
I don't care if you're the
Blessed Virgin Mary. Get out!

498
00:27:26,492 --> 00:27:28,025
Um...

499
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:32,192
Uh, I was actually...
I'm here from the college.

500
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:33,392
I was assigned to you.
I'm just...

501
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:35,226
I don't need schoolgirls
pestering me.

502
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,992
I'll give you three seconds
to remove yourself.

503
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,758
One, two, three.

504
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,292
Nurse!

505
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,392
Um...

506
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:43,492
[Cathleen] Nurse!

507
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,292
- Nurse!
- No, it's okay.

508
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:47,825
- I'll...
- What's going on here?

509
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:49,326
I have an intruder.

510
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,992
Don't you remember
our conversation, Cathleen?

511
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:58,092
What about? Me eating
more prunes? [chuckles]

512
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,426
The one about you being civil
to people who come to visit you.

513
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,226
[Cathleen]
I don't need any visitors.

514
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:04,125
I didn't last year
or the year before,

515
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,359
and I don't today.

516
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,392
You know what?
I'm sure I can get reassigned.

517
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:09,426
It was... I'm sorry.
It was really nice to meet you.

518
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:12,092
But can't you just give me
some other old person?

519
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,259
Please, I mean,
she's a crazy witch.

520
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,426
If I reassign you, I'm then
gonna have to make allowances

521
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,758
for all the other students. And
I'm not gonna deal with that.

522
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,359
But she doesn't want me
or anyone else there. Please.

523
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:23,025
The staff wouldn't have
assigned her

524
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,292
a student if she didn't need it.

525
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:26,459
Isn't there just a food bank

526
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:28,925
or an orphanage
or just anything else?

527
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,092
This is the assignment.
If you choose not to do it,

528
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,858
you won't pass
your Irish studies class.

529
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,925
I need to get
a good grade on this.

530
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,125
Then you'll have to go
make broomsticks with the witch.

531
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:40,858
Cheers.

532
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:46,226
[door creaks close]

533
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:01,159
Hello again, Mrs. Sweeney.

534
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:04,125
I think we got off
to a bad start the other day.

535
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:05,959
How...

536
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,792
How many times
do I have to tell you

537
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:10,292
to leave this bloody room?

538
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:12,792
Oh, I can't do that,
Mrs. Sweeney.

539
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,825
But we're gonna be friends.

540
00:29:14,858 --> 00:29:16,359
I did bring <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

541
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,192
I don't like Jane Austen.

542
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:19,326
It's too bad.

543
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,925
[Cathleen] And I don't want

544
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,426
to spend
all that remains of my life

545
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,359
with the likes of yourself.

546
00:29:25,392 --> 00:29:29,059
Okay, you know what? I tried
to get out of this, but I can't.

547
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:31,226
I was really hoping
for a sweet old granny,

548
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:32,259
but I got stuck with you.

549
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,359
So, now I have to do this
to get a good grade,

550
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:36,858
so I can be good enough
to get into this music school.

551
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,226
I have one last chance
to audition in three months.

552
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,992
So, we're gonna be friends,
whether you like it or not!

553
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:44,025
- Have you finished?
- Uh-hmm.

554
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:49,426
If this is
what young people have come to,

555
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:52,259
then the whole world is doomed.

556
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,259
I'm calling the nurse.

557
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,192
- Nurse!
- Okay. Well, I'm not leaving.

558
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:58,025
Nurse!

559
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:00,858
"It is a truth universally
acknowledged that a single man

560
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:02,825
in possession of good fortune
must be in want of a wife."

561
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:04,992
- Nurse Where's the nurse?
- "However..."

562
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:07,025
- Nurse!
- What's all this noise?

563
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:10,326
She won't leave.
She's invading my privacy.

564
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,359
I want to remove her at once!

565
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,459
Did you enter
without her permission?

566
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:21,459
Yeah. Yes.

567
00:30:21,492 --> 00:30:25,392
And did you refuse to leave when
Mrs. Sweeney asked you to do so?

568
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:26,392
Yes.

569
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,159
Good on you, young one.

570
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,459
Cathleen,
you can shout all you like,

571
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:36,992
but Finley's welcome to stay.

572
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:39,492
Bye, ladies.

573
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,025
[Finley]
If it's any consolation,

574
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,825
this went much better
in my head.

575
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,159
Hmm.

576
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:53,326
"It is a truth
universally acknowledged

577
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,359
that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must..."

578
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:15,392
She calm down?

579
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:16,858
Yeah, she fell asleep.

580
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,459
I have to check on a resident.

581
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,858
Do me a favor and pop this
into her top drawer.

582
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:24,125
Cathleen always tells me
to throw her post away,

583
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,959
but I know she just digs
these letters out

584
00:31:25,992 --> 00:31:27,392
of the bin and saves them.

585
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:29,059
No idea what it's about.

586
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:42,125
[dramatic music playing]

587
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:57,025
Hey, how was the nursing home?

588
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,959
Well, that bitter old lady,
Mrs. Sweeney, really hates me.

589
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:02,892
They've assigned you
Cathleen Sweeney?

590
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,059
Uh-hmm.

591
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:04,925
Who is this lady?

592
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:08,392
I wanna meet her. I bet you
I could make her smile.

593
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,825
Not a chance.

594
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,359
Gather round!

595
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,092
Fresh scones!

596
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:18,959
Damn it!

597
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,925
When are you going to learn?

598
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,725
Try a scone, guys.

599
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,192
Thanks, love.

600
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:30,025
Brilliant, Mr. Callahan.

601
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,259
Finally, something
we can agree on.

602
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:33,825
How's the movie going?

603
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:35,459
- I know Emma wants to know.
- Dad!

604
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:38,092
Well, it wasn't going well

605
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:40,226
until I started running lines
with Finley.

606
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,092
Now the director
can't stop complimenting me.

607
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,459
He says Steele Markov
has come alive.

608
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:46,392
Oh.

609
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:49,226
Do you think we could run
my other lines, tonight, maybe?

610
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,326
[Finley] I really need to get
to my violin composition

611
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,426
at some point.

612
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,326
Well, I can work
around your schedule.

613
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,025
I mean, if you want to come
to set after class or...

614
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,892
Or we could work here?

615
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,825
Uh, there's nothing special
about what I did.

616
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,125
Anyone could have done it.

617
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:05,992
- Thank you, Nora.
- Hey, do you think we can go

618
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,259
to the Cliffs
of Moher this weekend?

619
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:09,892
I am so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible.

620
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:11,758
These scrapbookers
are here all weekend.

621
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,359
- We can't leave.
- It's okay.

622
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,192
Well, I could take you.

623
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,858
Uh, no, I'll just go
with them when they can.

624
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:23,892
All right. Let me know
if you change your mind.

625

- [girl] Tom.
- Taken.

- Francis.

- Shaun.
- Taken.

- Why?
- He has a micro scooter.

- Does he?
- Yes.

are thinking about the festival.

are starting to ask.

634

- Oh, hi! Finley.
- Hey,

635
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,892
it's where I met me husband.

636
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,359
A magical night.

637
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:51,392
See, it's like everyone.

638
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:54,259
[Keeva] Hey. I've been asked
a couple of times.

639
00:33:54,758 --> 00:33:57,025
- Of course you have.
- You'll be there, Emma?

640
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,059
I mean, I know it's been
difficult for you in the past.

641
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:03,892
I mean, it was so sad, seeing
you alone last year, but...

642
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,226
I mean, I can help you out,
if you want.

643
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:10,025
But, I just got cast in
the new Beckett Rush film,

644
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,125
I just have to run on set
and shoot some things

645
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,025
with Beckett and Taylor.
But I'll see you guys around.

646
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:18,758
[Aileen] Get away from my shop,
you old drunk.

647
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,059
- Come on.
- Relax, Aileen.

648
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,059
- Run.
- I was gonna buy a book.

649
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,059
Have you got any of those
romantic novels for sale?

650
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:28,059
- Get out of here. Go.
- All right. I'll leave.

651
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,292
But I won't come back here
buy me books here anymore.

652
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:31,992
[Aileen]
You're scaring my customers.

653
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:37,259
Well, good afternoon,
young ladies.

654
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,925
Any chance
of the price of a pint

655
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,792
for a local struggling musician,

656
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:44,125
who places his art
above all else?

657
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,259
[Emma] Look, I would, Seamus.
But I only have

658
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,226
1.47 and a lollipop.

659
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,292
Well, it's a start.

660
00:34:50,326 --> 00:34:53,059
Seamus, go sleep it off
in the back of the pub.

661
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,526
You're right, Molly.

662
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,526
Thanks, but no thanks.

663
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,226
Ladies!

of me best customer,

00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:04,125
and tonight's
musical entertainment.

He's been napping here
in the streets for years.

667
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,226
He's got a little cottage
up the road,

668
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:10,092
but he rarely makes it
back there at night.

669
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,326
What can you do?
It's his life.

670
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,359
He'd rather buy fiddles
than pay the bills.

671
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:18,758
I better help him.
Good luck!

A convertible in Ireland?

675
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:48,925
Yeah. I want to be ready

676
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,292
for the three days
a year it doesn't rain.

677
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:53,092
- What are you doing?
- I was actually looking

678
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,526
for that cross.

679
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,459
Oh, you're not
gonna find it here.

680
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:59,758
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I already checked.

681

Oh. Okay.

682
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:05,125
But listen,
I'm a little worried about you

683
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,959
hanging out
in graveyards like this.

684
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:08,025
It's pretty creepy.

685
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,392
So, I'm gonna offer you a deal.

686
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:12,892
- Not interested.
- Just hear me out, okay.

687
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,159
You help me with my lines,

688
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:16,758
and I'll be
your personal tour guide.

689
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:20,758
Show you all the sights
of Ireland. Huh? Come on.

690
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,392
It'll help sweet Mrs. Callahan

Totally harmless.

- Trust me.
- No, I don't.

694
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,359
No, no, no, no.
I'm merely a humble tour guide.

695
00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:33,526
And for a limited time only,
I'm gonna offer you a free tour.

Just to make sure you know
you're getting

the better end of the deal.
So, come on. Let's go.

698
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:38,825
I'm taking you
to the Cliffs of Moher.

699
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:40,192
I can't. We can't go now.

700
00:36:40,226 --> 00:36:42,025
Don't you have
a photo shoot to do?

701
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:44,359
No. I told them I had to help
my boring friend learn

702
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:45,792
how to have some fun.

703
00:36:46,192 --> 00:36:47,925
Come on, Finley.

704
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,025
Take a risk.

705
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:53,025
You never know if
you're gonna have tomorrow.

706
00:36:58,226 --> 00:36:59,526
Okay.

[dramatic music playing]

708
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,359
[Beckett] Here we are,
at the Cliffs of Moher.

709
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,925
And what's that?

710
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:19,825
This is my disguise, young lady.

711
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:21,326
Pretty inconspicuous,
don't you think?

712
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:26,792
Breathtaking cliffs ahead,

713
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:28,825
and you're taking picture
of grass, come on.

714
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:31,858
Well, there's not that much
of it in Brooklyn.

715
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,992
Is that Beckett Rush?

716
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:41,359
[groans] I was hoping
for just one day without this.

Can we please get a selfie?

718
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:47,392
Johnny, don't you worry about
that nasty rash you have.

719
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:48,326
I still love you.

720
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,092
- What is she saying?
- Oh Franny, my dear.

721
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,992
Don't you think
we ought to get married?

722
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:54,025
It's only right
after you gave me those twins

723
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:55,959
at the ripe young age of 16.

724
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:57,492
I'm an unwed mother?

725
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,326
I'm a diseased baby daddy.
What do you want from me?

726
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,992
Come on,
I think we should leave it.

727
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:03,825
Okay, come on. Let's go.

728
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,292
Okay, they're gone.

729
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,858
You can let go of my hand now.

730
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,892
You were holding on to me. Okay?

731
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:15,059
Whatever.
That was close.

732
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,925
Thanks a lot for protecting me.

733
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,459
No problem.

734
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,226
So, what's the big deal
with these cliffs anyway?

735
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:23,025
Just you wait.

Do you even really like
being a movie star?

who wouldn't, right?

753

all at once.

Oh, yeah.

760
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,725
No, I mean it.
You're lucky.

761
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:47,125
Well, didn't you go
to school on set?

762
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:50,925
Usually, it was just me.

763
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:54,059
Sometimes, a few
other child actors and a tutor.

764
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,725
But no prom.

765
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,459
No graduation.

766
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:01,959
No embarrassing gym class.

Do you regret missing out
on that?

don't regret anything, though?

I just miss blending in,

it is not yet wise
to reveal your magical powers.

00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:19,259
Indeed.

Did you sneak onto set? I mean,
I'm not going to tell anybody.

No. Beckett invited me.

will have to say about that.

Not yet.
I've been kind of busy.

831

Yeah, the studio is really,

00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:24,092
really, in love
with what you're doing on set.

833
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,025
So, they made an official offer.
It's strong.

think it's time to maybe

what I can really do.

than just sword fighting and...

Oh, but you're so good at it.
That's what the fans wanna see.

843
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,292
Right?
Isn't that right?

844
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:52,758
You have a very small window
to capitalize on this.

845
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:55,125
Yeah, I'll think about it,
for sure.

846
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,992
Right now, we gotta cash in
on these sequels.

847
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,292
So, hurry up and read those
scripts. All right. Let's do it.

848

- Yeah, I will.
- Yeah.

and get your bags here or...

00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:38,459
You'll really like this book.

866
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:40,492
I'll decide what I like.

867
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:43,059
"It was 75 degrees in Phoenix.

868
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:46,025
The sky a perfect
cloudless blue.

869
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,226
I was wearing my favorite shirt,
sleeveless..."

870
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:50,159
It's cold.
I want to go inside.

871
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,492
You know, Mrs. Sweeney, um...

872
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:59,025
Who's Fiona Doyle?

873
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:02,326
What?
That's none of your business.

874
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:03,426
Oh, yeah.
I just... I thought

875
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:06,159
that maybe I could help you
find the right address.

876
00:45:06,192 --> 00:45:07,725
I have the right address.

877
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:11,159
- Then why...
- I don't want to discuss it.

878
00:45:11,858 --> 00:45:13,092
Okay.

879
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:16,459
You've been snooping
in my drawers.

880
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:20,059
Uh...

881
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,192
[Beckett] What's up, ladies?

882
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:23,492
Groovy day,
don't you think, man?

883
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:25,858
Convincing.

884
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:27,758
Do you need directions
to Woodstock?

885
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,858
Whoa, sister!
Give peace a chance.

886
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:34,359
Mrs. Sweeney,
this is Beckett Rush.

887
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:37,092
He's an actor in Dragon movies.

888
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,059
Mrs. Sweeney,
it's very lovely to meet you.

889
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:41,459
I've heard a lot about you.

890
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:44,359
Yes!
I've seen you on television.

891
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,192
You're in love
with the princess. [laughs]

892
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:50,025
Um, hey,
I brought you some treats

893
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:52,192
because I know they're not
giving you the good stuff here.

894
00:45:52,226 --> 00:45:53,992
Although I know it's
nothing like your cooking.

895
00:45:54,025 --> 00:45:55,959
You're probably a wiz
in the kitchen.

896
00:45:55,992 --> 00:45:58,326
Baking is my specialty.

897
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:00,459
Sugar and spice, my kinda lady.

898
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,858
You really can't turn it off,
can you?

899
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:07,025
There's nothing wrong
with spreading a little cheer.

900
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:08,992
Come on, make love, not war.

901
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,125
Tell me,
when did you start acting?

902
00:46:13,092 --> 00:46:16,192
I was seven years old.
My father got me into it.

903
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:18,326
- No!
- Do you ever do any acting?

904
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,426
Oh, yes.

905
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,025
What was your first role?

906
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,426
At school,
I played the white rabbit.

907
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:24,792
The white rabbit.

908
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,226
You look kinda like
the white rabbit.

909
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:27,925
[laughter]

910
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,925
You're funny.
You're a twit.

911
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:32,025
[laughter]

912
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:35,125
Thank you so much.

913
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:38,492
All right, thanks
for letting me stop by, guys.

914
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:40,025
Okay. Peace out.

915
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:41,792
Peace.

916
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,125
He's a fine young man.

917
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:46,392
He's a total player.

918
00:46:46,426 --> 00:46:47,992
[Cathleen] Don't tell me,

919
00:46:48,025 --> 00:46:50,359
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

920
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,259
He's a good boy.

921
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:54,959
I can spot a bad one
a mile away.

922
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:57,125
Now, carry on reading your book.

923
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:03,825
[Finley]
"In the Olympic Peninsula

924
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:05,192
of Northwest Washington
state..."

925
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,259
Thank God we've kept Beckett
hidden from them so far.

926
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:16,292
Hey

927
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,226
Do you know much
about Mrs. Sweeney?

928
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,992
I don't like to say things
if I've got nothing nice to say.

929
00:47:27,392 --> 00:47:30,426
Well, she's not that bad.

930
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:32,059
No, she's not bad.

931
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:35,259
She's terrible.

932
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,459
So then, who's Fiona Doyle?

933
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,292
Her sister.

934
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:44,226
Oh.

935
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:47,825
Mrs. Sweeney really wants
to get in touch with her.

936
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:49,992
What happened there?

937
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:54,392
I heard Cathleen Sweeney
stole her own sister's fiancé.

938
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:59,259
I mean, who would do
such a thing?

939
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,426
I'm saying no more.

940
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,359
Then, she left him, a few years
after they get married.

941
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:07,326
He was heartbroken.

942
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,792
They say he drank himself
to death not long after.

943
00:48:09,825 --> 00:48:11,259
That's it.
I'm saying no more.

944
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,459
But if Mrs. Sweeney
is the man stealer,

945
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:18,359
then why is she
the one that's so bitter?

946
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:21,159
Just getting what she deserved,
I guess.

947
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,426
[violin music playing]

948
00:48:38,226 --> 00:48:39,426
[knocks on door]

949
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:47,892
It's your friendly Irish
tour guide.

950
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:48,959
Hey!

951
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,326
Let's take this out
of your hands.

952
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,326
Let's actually be
really careful with that.

953
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:54,259
We don't really need it
because I have got

954
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:56,858
the rest of the week off, and
it's time for your next tour.

955
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,825
We're about to have ourselves
some real Irish fun.

956
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:00,959
It's not a good idea
for me to be going out

957
00:49:00,992 --> 00:49:02,292
to one of your
exclusive nightclubs

958
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:04,359
or whatever it is you do.

959
00:49:04,392 --> 00:49:06,159
And who says
that I'm into nightclubs?

960
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:08,892
Uh, every tabloid in
the supermarket checkout line.

961
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:11,092
Well, don't believe
everything you read.

962
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:13,259
Beckett,
I really have to practice.

963
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:16,092
Hey, as your tour guide, it's my
job to make sure you don't spend

964
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,326
all of your time in Ireland
cooped up in this room.

965
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:19,992
It's what you find
outside of this place

966
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:22,892
that's gonna help you
write your try-out song.

967
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:24,758
It's a composition.

968
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:28,059
Whatever.
God, you are so uptight.

969
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:30,992
No I'm not.

970
00:49:31,025 --> 00:49:32,459
Oh yeah, you kind of are.

971
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:38,959
Fine. Where are we going?

972
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:42,359
You will see, milady.
Come on, let's go.

973
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:44,125
I'm not even dressed!

974
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,259
No, you are perfect
just the way you are.

975
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,092
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

976
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:48,825
Wait.

977
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:52,426
[Beckett] This is my favorite
place in all of Ireland.

978
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:54,359
[Finley] This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

979
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:55,825
[Beckett] Just trust me.

980
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:58,292
[indistinct chatter]

981
00:49:58,326 --> 00:50:01,459
Oh! Good golly, Mrs. Molly!
I've missed you!

982
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:03,459
If it isn't me favorite fella!

983
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:05,159
- Finley!
- Hi, Molly.

984
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:07,526
Give everybody a round on me!
Drinks are on me!

985
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,959
[cheering]

986
00:50:09,992 --> 00:50:11,858
Cole, you stand guard
at the door.

987
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:13,959
Make sure no reporters
get in here.

988
00:50:13,992 --> 00:50:16,858
Beckett Rush rules!
No pictures!

989
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:18,492
These guys are great.

990
00:50:18,526 --> 00:50:19,758
Where's Seamus?

991
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:21,792
He's already had a few pints.

992
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:27,792
Looks like it's time
to wake him up then.

993
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,292
Come on. You could learn
a thing or two from this guy.

994
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:34,159
What am I gonna learn from him?
He's like, homeless, and...

995
00:50:35,226 --> 00:50:36,992
You'll see. Don't worry.

996
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:43,226
Seamus!

997
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:47,326
Oh Molly, let me just
crash here tonight, will you?

998
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,326
Oh, you can crash
with me any time.

999
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:52,492
Oh, it's you, boy. [laughs]

1000
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:53,959
What do you want?

1001
00:50:53,992 --> 00:50:55,292
Well, what do you think I want?

1002
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:56,959
I want you to get
this party started!

1003
00:50:56,992 --> 00:50:58,259
I brought
this American girl here

1004
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:00,125
to show her some real Irish fun.

1005
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:01,959
We can do that.

1006
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:06,159
[singing in foreign language]

1007
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,492
[Irish pub song playing]

1008
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:23,892
Whoo!

1009
00:51:23,925 --> 00:51:27,025
[Irish pub song continues]

1010
00:51:31,226 --> 00:51:36,192
[Seamus]
[singing in foreign language]

1011
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,359
He's great.

1012
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:41,326
[cheers and applause]

1013
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,925
[Seamus] Thank you, boys.

1014
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:52,125
I'm told we've got
a fine young fiddler player

1015
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:53,492
here in the audience tonight.

1016
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:56,259
Can you go up
and give us a tune, please.

1017
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:59,825
No. I don't play fiddle.
I play the violin.

1018
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:01,825
Oh, fiddle, faddle, fuddle,
whatever you call it,

1019
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:04,226
it doesn't matter. Come on
up here and join us, lass.

1020
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:05,892
Oh, come on, go up there.

1021
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:07,492
- Come on.
- [Seamus] Come on, girl!

1022
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:09,725
We won't bite ya!

1023
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:11,326
Come on.

1024
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,192
Give her a round
of applause, everybody.

1025
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:15,226
[applause]

1026
00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:16,992
I'm going to kill you.

1027
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:19,992
Yeah. That's fine.
Just after you play.

1028
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:23,326
Now, repeat after me.

1029
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,492
[violin music playing]

1030
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:47,159
Now, you're in a pub in Ireland,
not in an orchestra.

1031
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:47,992
Enjoy yourself.

1032
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:50,259
Doesn't matter what your fingers
or the notes are.

1033
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,192
It's how you play them, right.

1034
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:54,892
Play them with your heart.
Play it like you feel it.

1035
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,292
If you feel it, they will.

1036
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:58,025
Do you love that instrument?

1037
00:52:58,059 --> 00:52:59,992
- Yeah.

01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,359
I need a little
sparkling water, please.

1211
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,326
I felt that, Beck.

1212
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:29,925
Thanks, Tay.

1213
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,292
You did great too.

1214
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:35,226
Very strong performance, son.

1215
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:36,226
Thanks, Dad.

1216
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:39,992
[Montgomery]
They were crying at the monitor.

1217
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:42,426
Seriously.

1218
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,925
Does that feel good?

1219
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:45,459
Yeah, it felt great.

1220
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:47,025
It should.

1221
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,392
Yeah, everyone's very
impressed with your work.

1222
01:02:49,426 --> 01:02:50,858
You have a lot
of leverage right now.

1223
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,459
You should really sign
those contracts.

1224
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:54,758
I guess.

1225
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:58,959
Hey, you're trending.
Have you seen the article?

1226
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:00,259
No, I was busy.

1227
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:01,426
With your assistant?

1228
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:03,192
No. Just busy.

1229
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:05,192
Uh-hmm. Here it is.

1230
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:07,992
"Beckett Rush
was spotted in Dublin.

1231
01:03:08,025 --> 01:03:09,925
The heartthrob spent
the evening with two models

1232
01:03:09,959 --> 01:03:12,959
at the exclusive Emerald Lounge
until Taylor Risdale showed up,

1233
01:03:12,992 --> 01:03:15,526
discovered the tryst,
and a cat fight broke out.

1234
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:18,858
R 'n R
is officially on the rocks."

1235
01:03:18,892 --> 01:03:21,359
Yeah, and my name
is officially trashed again.

1236
01:03:21,925 --> 01:03:24,059
Your movie sales
spiked five percent.

1237
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,259
You should be thanking me.

1238
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:28,758
[indistinct chatter]

1239
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,426
[Finley] So, you know,
things with the hippie guy

1240
01:03:38,459 --> 01:03:40,959
are going interesting.

1241
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:45,858
Oh, and I'm still taking violin
lessons from Seamus. Of course,

1242
01:03:45,892 --> 01:03:47,359
he calls it the fiddle.

1243
01:03:47,392 --> 01:03:50,192
Oh, next time you come,
bring the fiddle.

1244
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:53,326
I'd like to hear
if you're any good.

1245
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,125
Yeah, I will.

1246
01:04:04,025 --> 01:04:05,125
Um...

1247
01:04:05,892 --> 01:04:06,925
Mrs. Sweeney,

1248
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:11,359
I heard about what happened

1249
01:04:11,392 --> 01:04:13,192
between you and your sister.

1250
01:04:16,092 --> 01:04:18,192
No, stay out of my business.

1251
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:25,025
Well...

1252
01:04:26,192 --> 01:04:29,858
I mean,
you are just the grumpiest woman

1253
01:04:29,892 --> 01:04:31,925
I have ever met
in my entire life.

1254
01:04:31,959 --> 01:04:34,959
I know something, you know,
made you that way, right!

1255
01:04:34,992 --> 01:04:39,426
And what they said you did is,
well, it's pretty shady but...

1256
01:04:41,892 --> 01:04:44,326
No, no. You know what,
none of this makes sense.

1257
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:46,459
I know that you care
about Fiona,

1258
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:48,426
so I'm gonna help you,
no matter what.

1259
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:50,292
I don't want your help.

1260
01:04:50,326 --> 01:04:51,326
Leave me alone.

1261
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,092
[Finley] What?

1262
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:55,392
I'm dying.

1263
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,725
What?

1264
01:05:01,092 --> 01:05:02,226
Cancer.

1265
01:05:03,226 --> 01:05:05,092
I've only awhile to live.

1266
01:05:06,426 --> 01:05:08,392
Why didn't you say anything?

1267
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:17,758
[indistinct]

1268
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,092
- [Finley] <i>Hey!</i>
- [Beckett] <i>You're late.</i>

1269
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,459
I know. But I just,
I came from Mrs. Sweeney and...

1270
01:05:23,492 --> 01:05:25,259
Let's just run the lines, okay.

1271
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:26,292
Please.

1272
01:05:27,892 --> 01:05:29,092
Okay.

1273
01:05:30,959 --> 01:05:32,259
[Montgomery] Well, well, well,

1274
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,758
how is my son's lovely
assistant doing?

1275
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:37,025
Um, I'm more
of an acting partner.

1276
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:39,125
Oh, I used to be an actor.

1277
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:42,292
I mean, things have changed
a lot since then.

1278
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:46,159
[Finley] I think it's so kind
how you sacrificed so much

1279
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,459
for Beckett's career.

1280
01:05:47,492 --> 01:05:48,526
He was a natural.

1281
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:52,292
I mean, he needed to be in LA
to make his dream a reality.

1282
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:55,392
I don't ever remember saying
I wanted to be an actor.

1283
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:56,292
[Montgomery] You did.

1284
01:05:56,659 --> 01:05:59,259
"Dad, I want to be in movies"
is exactly what you said.

1285
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:00,792
[scoffs]

1286
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:01,693
I was six years old.

1287
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:04,892
I also said I wanted to be
an astronaut and a giraffe.

1288
01:06:05,693 --> 01:06:08,226
Excuse me, Beckett,
they're ready for you on set.

1289
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:15,125
I'll be right back, okay.

1290
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:17,959
Actually,
I need to leave too.

1291
01:06:17,992 --> 01:06:20,925
I could really use your help
on this scene after we shoot.

1292
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:24,226
I need to do something
for Mrs. Sweeney.

1293
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:26,858
Beck, we need you on set.

1294
01:06:26,892 --> 01:06:28,059
Yeah.

1295
01:06:28,492 --> 01:06:29,758
Sorry.

1296
01:06:40,825 --> 01:06:43,459
[Montgomery] Finley.
Hey!

1297
01:06:45,192 --> 01:06:47,492
You seem like
a really nice girl.

1298
01:06:47,526 --> 01:06:50,326
And I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

1299
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:53,092
This kind of thing happens
all the time.

1300
01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:56,892
What do you mean by that?

1301
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:00,226
I just suggest you keep things
very professional with Beckett.

1302
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:02,226
He's with Taylor.

1303
01:07:03,025 --> 01:07:04,426
Is he, that...

1304
01:07:04,459 --> 01:07:07,758
I just... it doesn't really seem
like he is.

1305
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:10,092
No, they'll be back together
again very soon.

1306
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,858
Oh, okay.

1307
01:07:12,892 --> 01:07:17,025
So, you manipulate his career
and his love life?

1308
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,025
His love life is his career.

1309
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:24,725
So, if you really care
about him...

1310
01:07:26,092 --> 01:07:28,059
don't get in the way.

1311
01:07:31,259 --> 01:07:35,259
[sentimental music playing]

1312
01:07:49,992 --> 01:07:52,492
- Seamus! Seamus, wake up.
- Hey! No broom.

1313
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,292
No broom. Huh?

1314
01:07:54,326 --> 01:07:55,792
Finley?

1315
01:07:57,192 --> 01:07:58,925
What are you doing here?

1316
01:07:59,626 --> 01:08:02,426
I need you to tell me
where Fiona Doyle lives.

1317
01:08:03,192 --> 01:08:05,892
What are you doing
with those bickering old ladies?

1318
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,192
I need to help Mrs. Sweeney.

1319
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:10,292
Why?

1320
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:12,359
- No one else ever has.
- I know, I know.

1321
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:14,159
And that's what
I don't understand.

1322
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:16,825
Why does everyone
hate her so much?

1323
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:17,925
[sighs]

1324
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:21,025
Cathleen Sweeney.
[laughs]

1325
01:08:21,758 --> 01:08:25,758
Cathleen
was an absolute stunner.

1326
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,758
She was the best-looking girl
in the town.

1327
01:08:27,792 --> 01:08:29,426
And it was no surprise

1328
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:32,092
that she was able to lure
Charles Sweeney

1329
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,059
away from her
sweet little sister.

1330
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:38,226
When he died shortly
after Cathleen had left him,

1331
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:43,292
the whole town blamed her
and she had not a friend left.

1332
01:08:43,593 --> 01:08:46,892
She was shunned by everybody,
even by her own family.

1333
01:08:47,892 --> 01:08:51,758
Now, no one wants the opinion
of an old fiddle player.

1334
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:54,792
Between you and I,
I think there was more going on.

1335
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:57,359
It just didn't add up,
you know what I mean.

1336
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:00,925
Here, show me your map.

1337
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:03,992
Oh, I hate these things.

1338
01:09:04,025 --> 01:09:05,059
Sorry.

1339
01:09:05,092 --> 01:09:07,825
Look, she lives in a little farm

1340
01:09:07,858 --> 01:09:09,259
just outside of town.

1341
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,858
Now it's a hell of a bicycle
ride up the hill,

1342
01:09:11,892 --> 01:09:13,059
but you never know,

1343
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:15,192
we might be able
to figure something out.

1344
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,858
What time does Connor come by
to pick up the empty kegs?

1345
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,825
He said he'd be here
half an hour ago.

1346
01:09:19,858 --> 01:09:21,059
He should be here any minute.

1347
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,392
[dramatic music playing]

1348
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:30,159
[cheerful music playing]

1349
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:48,025
Thanks.

1350
01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:04,159
Have you come for the pig?

1351
01:10:04,792 --> 01:10:05,526
Uh, no.

1352
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:07,492
Hi, I'm Finley Sinclair.

1353
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:09,925
I'm a friend of your sister's.

1354
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:11,526
I don't have a sister.

1355
01:10:11,559 --> 01:10:13,125
Please wait.

1356
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:16,825
Cathleen's dying of bone cancer.

1357
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:19,359
She doesn't have much time.

1358
01:10:19,959 --> 01:10:21,892
She got what was coming to her.

1359
01:10:22,559 --> 01:10:24,092
Did she make you come here?

1360
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:26,792
No. She has no idea
that I'm here.

1361
01:10:26,825 --> 01:10:28,959
Cathleen ceased to be my sister

1362
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,758
the moment she went
after that man.

1363
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:34,226
So now, good day to you.

1364
01:10:35,992 --> 01:10:38,125
[birds chirping]

1365
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:43,192
[indistinct chattering]

1366
01:10:43,959 --> 01:10:46,292
So, what? She's got only
a few weeks left to live?

1367
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,992
I just...
I don't know what to do.

1368
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:51,192
Now, Miss Sweeney won't talk,
and Fiona won't listen.

1369
01:10:51,226 --> 01:10:53,125
So, I'm stuck.

1370
01:10:54,559 --> 01:10:57,125
Our latest post just reached
a million likes.

1371
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:59,092
I forgave you.

1372
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:03,892
You know, it reminds me
of that picture

1373
01:11:03,925 --> 01:11:05,992
we took in Paris
when we were 15.

1374
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:07,925
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1375
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:13,292
Hey Beckett, Taylor,
they're ready for you on set.

1376
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:14,725
Thanks.

1377
01:11:17,825 --> 01:11:20,025
Look, Finley,
can we just talk later?

1378
01:11:20,593 --> 01:11:23,125
Yeah, of course, yeah.

1379
01:11:24,526 --> 01:11:26,526
Hey, look at all these
articles about us.

1380
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:30,326
Beckett rushes back to Risdale.
R 'n R returns.

1381
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:33,825
Beckett begs for Taylor
to come back, and she does.

1555
01:21:51,392 --> 01:21:52,758
Emma, Orla.

1556
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:56,792
Tea is here if you want it.

1557
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:57,925
Good night.

1558
01:22:03,858 --> 01:22:06,059
All right. This is how
I'm going to spin it, okay?

1559
01:22:06,092 --> 01:22:07,159
Beckett Rush crashes

1560
01:22:07,192 --> 01:22:09,892
a small Irish festival
or whatever the hell it is.

1561
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,025
You have one too many drinks.

1562
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:14,259
You make girls' dreams come true
by giving them kisses.

1563
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:16,858
That'll keep you wild, kind,
and still with Taylor.

1564
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:18,259
The fans will eat that up.

1565
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:21,925
How can you do this to him?
That's not who he is!

1566
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:23,292
And how long have you known him?

1567
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:25,092
You need to be quiet,
and step away

1568
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:26,892
from things
you know nothing about.

1569
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:30,758
Beckett, she doesn't know you
the way that I do.

1570
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:32,359
- He's just try...
- Finley.

1571
01:22:32,392 --> 01:22:33,858
That's enough, okay?

1572
01:22:33,892 --> 01:22:35,959
Son, you're the envy
of the world.

1573
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,226
Why wouldn't you want that?

1574
01:22:37,259 --> 01:22:39,226
He just does this to please you.

1575
01:22:39,259 --> 01:22:40,392
Can't you see that?

1576
01:22:40,426 --> 01:22:42,258
He just wants
to have a normal life.

1577
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:46,059
- Maybe go to college.
- Finley, just... just stop!

1578
01:22:50,792 --> 01:22:52,858
You know what,
maybe Taylor's right.

1579
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:55,992
Maybe you're never
gonna understand!

1580
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:04,392
You're just his puppet.

1581
01:23:05,259 --> 01:23:07,492
You don't even have the balls
to stand up

1582
01:23:07,526 --> 01:23:09,292
for who you really are.

1583
01:23:10,825 --> 01:23:14,025
Hey, don't worry. Okay.

1584
01:23:14,526 --> 01:23:17,225
She just can't understand
our life.

1585
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:20,459
It's for the best.

1586
01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:25,059
Will you guys
just leave me alone right now?

1587
01:23:27,192 --> 01:23:30,259
[dramatic music playing]

1588
01:23:31,959 --> 01:23:33,526
I'm telling you,

1589
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:35,858
I'm warning yous right now,
get out of here.

1590
01:23:35,892 --> 01:23:37,259
The lot of ya.

1591
01:23:43,892 --> 01:23:46,192
- Thanks so much, Nora.
- Well played, Nora.

1592
01:23:47,858 --> 01:23:49,925
I really wish
I didn't have to leave you guys.

1593
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:51,159
But you're never gonna have
any peace

1594
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:52,825
with me staying here, so.

1595
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:53,725
We'll miss you.

1596
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:56,059
But you know you can come back
and be my sous-chef anytime.

1597
01:23:56,092 --> 01:23:57,359
Oh, Sean, I got you something.

1598
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:02,825
[Sean laughs]

1599
01:24:03,426 --> 01:24:05,758
No more burnt hands, huh!

1600
01:24:06,192 --> 01:24:07,459
I love them.

1601
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,992
Thanks, buddy.

1602
01:24:10,392 --> 01:24:11,992
- Nora!
- Oh, sweetheart!

1603
01:24:13,192 --> 01:24:15,025
I'm gonna miss you, guys.

1604
01:24:25,259 --> 01:24:29,025
[indistinct chatter]

1605
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:38,825
Beckett, let's take a walk.

1606
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,492
I'm sorry, I'm working.

1607
01:24:41,025 --> 01:24:43,992
I don't care.
Come with me. Now.

1608
01:24:50,858 --> 01:24:52,925
Ciara, Shenae, Logan,

1609
01:24:52,959 --> 01:24:54,326
everyone down there,

1610
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:57,226
everyone in post
and marketing in LA.

1611
01:24:57,526 --> 01:24:58,593
All these people
are your friends

1612
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:01,192
who work on the movie,
they're here because of you.

1613
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:02,326
They depend on you.

1614
01:25:02,725 --> 01:25:04,192
Your movies sell,

1615
01:25:04,226 --> 01:25:06,059
which provides
for their families.

1616
01:25:06,092 --> 01:25:08,426
If you're not gonna do this
for you or for me,

1617
01:25:08,459 --> 01:25:10,125
at least do it for them.

1618
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:14,192
And Taylor.

1619
01:25:14,992 --> 01:25:17,892
You've grown up together.
You've been through a lot.

1620
01:25:17,925 --> 01:25:20,426
She's the only person
on this planet

1621
01:25:20,459 --> 01:25:23,025
who truly understands
what you've been through.

1622
01:25:26,459 --> 01:25:28,925
It's just not like you
to betray people.

1623
01:25:43,426 --> 01:25:47,192
[dramatic music playing]

1624
01:26:19,226 --> 01:26:20,825
I'm so sorry.

1625
01:26:21,326 --> 01:26:23,059
It's fine, no.
It's fine.

1626
01:26:23,092 --> 01:26:25,059
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

1627
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:26,925
It's fine. It's fine.

1628
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:32,226
[dramatic music playing]

1629
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:39,092
[phone ringing]

1630
01:26:41,092 --> 01:26:44,092
- Hello!
- <i>Finley, it's me, Seamus.</i>

1631
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,226
Oh, hey, what's up?

1632
01:26:45,259 --> 01:26:46,825
[Seamus]
<i>Can you come down to the pub</i>

1633
01:26:46,858 --> 01:26:48,092
<i>as soon as you can, please?</i>

1634
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:50,392
Uh... Yeah, sure.

1635
01:26:54,259 --> 01:26:55,392
Hey, guys.

1636
01:26:55,426 --> 01:26:56,925
Ah, there you are, Finley.

1637
01:26:57,825 --> 01:26:59,326
So what's up?

1638
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,725
Give him a chance.

1639
01:27:07,559 --> 01:27:09,059
Thank you, Seamus.

1640
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,125
Hey!

1641
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:16,226
Sorry about all that.

1642
01:27:16,259 --> 01:27:18,192
I just didn't think
you'd come if I called.

1643
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:22,125
I've been thinking about you.

1644
01:27:23,426 --> 01:27:25,259
Your audition's next week.

1645
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:28,326
Yeah.

1646
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:30,492
Look, uh...

1647
01:27:32,992 --> 01:27:34,392
I'm sorry about the other night.

1648
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:36,259
I screwed up.

1649
01:27:37,559 --> 01:27:39,825
Please, just give me
a little bit more time,

1650
01:27:39,858 --> 01:27:41,092
and I'll figure all this out.

1651
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:47,292
If you wanna live
this double life,

1652
01:27:50,059 --> 01:27:51,925
I can't be a part of either one.

1653
01:27:53,492 --> 01:27:55,725
Look, it's harder
than it looks, okay.

1654
01:27:57,326 --> 01:27:59,025
I'm just trying to protect you.

1655
01:27:59,992 --> 01:28:01,959
I don't want you to
expose yourself to the media,

1656
01:28:01,992 --> 01:28:04,025
have your name dragged
through the mud like that?

1657
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:05,892
- Do you want that?
- Yes.

1658
01:28:06,192 --> 01:28:08,326
If that's what it takes
to be real.

1659
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:15,392
It's not just about me, okay!

1660
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:18,192
I have a lot of people
depending on me,

1661
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:19,992
and I don't wanna let them down.

1662
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:23,725
Yeah.

1663
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:28,259
You know, Taylor was right.

1664
01:28:28,292 --> 01:28:29,392
No.

1665
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:34,125
I don't know what I was thinking
that this could work.

1666
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,459
But we can, okay.

1667
01:28:36,492 --> 01:28:38,025
Come on.

1668
01:28:38,059 --> 01:28:39,359
We can.

1669
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:42,059
You just gotta trust me.

1670
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:45,226
I tried.

1671
01:28:47,825 --> 01:28:51,059
[dramatic music playing]

1672
01:28:59,526 --> 01:29:01,492
I mean,
you're probably the first girl

1673
01:29:01,526 --> 01:29:03,492
to ever break up
with Beckett Rush.

1674
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:09,226
So why am I crying so much?

1675
01:29:17,426 --> 01:29:20,459
[violin music playing]

1676
01:29:29,559 --> 01:29:31,259
You see, Finley,

1677
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:33,426
life rarely works out
the way we plan it.

1678
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:37,092
You've got to learn to play
the sorrow as well as the joy.

1679
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:40,059
They are linked,
like day and night.

1680
01:29:40,092 --> 01:29:42,925
You can't have one
without the other.

1681
01:29:42,959 --> 01:29:44,092
Give it a go.

1682
01:29:59,426 --> 01:30:02,025
Very good. Good.

1683
01:30:05,326 --> 01:30:07,292
Beautiful.

1684
01:30:38,825 --> 01:30:43,492
Beckett's told me
you broke it off.

1685
01:30:43,959 --> 01:30:45,459
Are you suffering?

1686
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:49,259
- You saw him?
- Uh-hmm.

1687
01:30:53,226 --> 01:30:55,226
Make love, not war.

1688
01:30:55,259 --> 01:30:56,959
Love, Beckett.

1689
01:31:00,959 --> 01:31:02,159
Yeah.

1690
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,758
My little troubles seem petty
compared to yours.

1691
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,892
I asked you.
I want to know.

1692
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:11,192
He's a good boy.

1693
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:13,192
Yeah.

1694
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:18,259
It's hard to change.

1695
01:31:23,092 --> 01:31:25,125
Mrs. Sweeney...

1696
01:31:27,559 --> 01:31:29,825
what really happened

1697
01:31:29,858 --> 01:31:32,259
between you and your sister
all those years ago?

1698
01:31:32,292 --> 01:31:34,292
I took my sister's fella.

1699
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:36,492
No, don't give me that.

1700
01:31:36,526 --> 01:31:38,492
There has to be more to it.

1701
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,858
People would tell ya otherwise.

1702
01:31:42,259 --> 01:31:43,758
Well...

1703
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:48,825
being here in Ireland
has taught me to look deeper.

1704
01:31:51,526 --> 01:31:53,426
Things aren't always
as they seem.

1705
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,359
My father was a gambler.

1706
01:32:06,392 --> 01:32:11,025
He'd bet on anything,
horses, politics...

1707
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,758
the weather.

1708
01:32:14,492 --> 01:32:19,059
Eventually,
we were about to lose our house.

1709
01:32:19,092 --> 01:32:21,025
It would've killed my mother.

1710
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:26,392
She... it had been in her family
for generations.

1711
01:32:26,858 --> 01:32:31,159
So, my father made a deal
with Mr. Sweeney

1712
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,858
which had a very high price.

1713
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:39,992
Our family name
meant something then.

1714
01:32:40,025 --> 01:32:43,858
Charles Sweeney had money,
but he had no social standing.

1715
01:32:44,259 --> 01:32:48,025
My little sister
didn't have many suitors.

1716
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:53,125
So how did you end up
with Charles Sweeney?

1717
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:55,758
When Charles Sweeney drank,

1718
01:32:56,059 --> 01:32:57,792
he got angry.

1719
01:32:57,825 --> 01:32:59,025
He was violent.

1720
01:33:01,192 --> 01:33:03,159
I had an eye for these things.

1721
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:05,959
He was clever.

1722
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:10,892
He left bruises
where you couldn't see.

1723
01:33:14,559 --> 01:33:17,825
So you took her place?

1724
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:20,359
You were protecting her,
and she never knew.

1725
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:25,125
She thought
I took him for the money.

1726
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:29,059
My sister was blinded
with young love.

1727
01:33:29,593 --> 01:33:31,858
How did Charles Sweeney die?

1728
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:37,125
People said I killed him.

1729
01:33:39,292 --> 01:33:40,892
Did you?

1730
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:45,092
If wishes were bullets.

1731
01:33:56,992 --> 01:33:59,025
Why didn't you just start over?

1732
01:33:59,459 --> 01:34:01,459
When no one wants to hear,

1733
01:34:01,693 --> 01:34:03,892
it's better to hide

1734
01:34:05,392 --> 01:34:07,125
hide and be angry.

1735
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:14,492
Well, didn't I wear my anger
like a grand fur coat!

1736
01:34:15,426 --> 01:34:17,825
It all was for nothing.

1737
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:22,925
Wasted years!

1738
01:34:22,959 --> 01:34:25,159
In the end, it's a choice,

1739
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,858
and I made the wrong one.

- Hey.
- [Finely] <i>Hey.</i>

1746
01:35:18,526 --> 01:35:20,059
I need a favor.

1747
01:35:20,593 --> 01:35:22,792
So, you called me first?

1748
01:35:22,825 --> 01:35:25,392
[Finely] <i>No.
I tried everyone else.</i>

1749
01:35:25,426 --> 01:35:26,858

1750
01:35:26,892 --> 01:35:28,825
Okay, what's up?

1751
01:35:28,858 --> 01:35:30,758
Mrs. Sweeney
told me the whole story.

1752
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:32,226
I have to get to Fiona's.

1753
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:33,925
Where are...

1754
01:35:33,959 --> 01:35:36,292
Did you try riding up there
in this rain?

1755
01:35:36,326 --> 01:35:37,359
[Finely] <i>Maybe.</i>

1756
01:35:37,392 --> 01:35:39,259
Perfect day for a convertible.

1757
01:35:40,992 --> 01:35:42,392
All right,
I'll be there.

1758
01:35:57,459 --> 01:36:01,292
Hey, we really need
to talk to you.

1759
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:02,858
It's important.

1760
01:36:02,892 --> 01:36:04,226
I have nothing to say to you.

1761
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,125
She's just trying to help, okay.

1762
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:07,892
Please, hear her out.

1763
01:36:17,059 --> 01:36:18,392
Thank you.

1764
01:36:18,426 --> 01:36:21,792
We just wanted to let you know

1765
01:36:21,825 --> 01:36:24,725
that Cathleen isn't expected
to live much longer.

1766
01:36:26,992 --> 01:36:30,459
We've talked about
the past some, her regrets.

1767
01:36:31,392 --> 01:36:34,492
How could you steal a man
away from your own sister?

1768
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:38,492
She tried to explain herself
in the letters.

1769
01:36:40,426 --> 01:36:42,025
Did you ever even read them?

1770
01:36:42,392 --> 01:36:43,492
Why would I?

1771
01:36:43,526 --> 01:36:48,326
Miss Doyle, your sister
married Charles to protect you.

1772
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:53,492
He was physically abusive.

1773
01:36:55,526 --> 01:36:58,326
How am I supposed
to believe all this?

1774
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:01,492
Cathleen begged your father
to drop the arrangement.

1775
01:37:01,526 --> 01:37:04,159
But he was in too much debt,
and Charles was

1776
01:37:04,559 --> 01:37:06,825
too dangerous to cross.

1777
01:37:08,259 --> 01:37:10,825
It was so humiliating.

1778
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:12,725
I'm really sorry about that.

1779
01:37:14,892 --> 01:37:18,459
But your sister
has been shunned for decades

1780
01:37:18,492 --> 01:37:20,159
for trying to help you,

1781
01:37:20,192 --> 01:37:22,259
and you won't even open

1782
01:37:22,292 --> 01:37:24,392
- the letters that she...
- Finley.

1783
01:37:28,492 --> 01:37:33,025
Look, Miss Doyle...
your sister's dying wish

1784
01:37:33,059 --> 01:37:35,359
is that she would
have your forgiveness.

1785
01:37:36,392 --> 01:37:38,459
Please, just...

1786
01:37:41,025 --> 01:37:43,092
come and see her.

1787
01:37:47,226 --> 01:37:50,392
I think you two
should be on your way now.

1788
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:09,125
- Hey!
- [Taylor] Hey.

1789
01:38:09,159 --> 01:38:10,492
Come in.

1790
01:38:11,392 --> 01:38:13,125
What's up?

1791
01:38:13,159 --> 01:38:14,992
Nothing. How are ya?

1792
01:38:15,892 --> 01:38:16,925
Pretty tired.

1793
01:38:16,959 --> 01:38:18,059
Yeah.

1794
01:38:18,925 --> 01:38:20,959
So...

1795
01:38:21,892 --> 01:38:24,858
are you seriously thinking about
not signing that contract?

1796
01:38:29,259 --> 01:38:30,925
I don't know yet.

1797
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:37,426
Beck.

1798
01:38:40,825 --> 01:38:45,426
look, we...
are in this together.

1799
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:51,959
You and me,
we've... we're linked.

1800
01:38:52,392 --> 01:38:53,959
Always have been.

1801
01:38:58,858 --> 01:39:02,025
What you do impacts me.

1802
01:39:04,559 --> 01:39:06,426
Please don't do this.

1803
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,992
After everything
we've been through.

1804
01:39:14,792 --> 01:39:16,159
We need this.

1805
01:39:17,492 --> 01:39:18,492
Yeah.

1806
01:39:23,892 --> 01:39:25,492
So, what are we supposed to do?

1807
01:39:26,992 --> 01:39:30,326
Just sacrifice our whole lives?

1808
01:39:31,559 --> 01:39:34,292
I don't know. It doesn't make
any sense to me.

1809
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:42,858
So few understand
this life that we made.

1810
01:39:48,892 --> 01:39:51,426
Does she really know you
the way I do?

1811
01:39:55,326 --> 01:39:56,992
Think about it.

1812
01:40:00,492 --> 01:40:07,326
I'll be in my room,
if you wanna talk.

1813
01:40:10,892 --> 01:40:12,326
Hey, Tay.

1814
01:40:13,259 --> 01:40:14,825
Yeah?

1815
01:40:19,192 --> 01:40:21,059
Would you ride your bike
in the pouring rain

1816
01:40:21,092 --> 01:40:22,725
just to help an old lady?

1817
01:40:24,526 --> 01:40:26,192
Of course.

1818
01:40:27,226 --> 01:40:29,092
But I wouldn't need to.

1819
01:40:29,626 --> 01:40:31,959
Just hire a driver.

[Finely] <i>I leave
for New York tomorrow.</i>

1821
01:40:54,392 --> 01:40:58,025
It's crazy to think
that this one audition

1822
01:40:58,059 --> 01:41:00,792
is gonna decide
the direction of my life.

1823
01:41:02,392 --> 01:41:03,792
Yeah.

1824
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:08,359
If you'd got
in the first time...

1825
01:41:09,792 --> 01:41:12,159
you wouldn't be bugging me now.

1826
01:41:13,959 --> 01:41:16,025
Yeah.
I guess that's true.

1827
01:41:16,059 --> 01:41:17,858
I'm glad you botched it.

1828
01:41:22,825 --> 01:41:27,125
Mrs. Sweeney,
I'm so sorry...

1829
01:41:27,159 --> 01:41:30,359
that I couldn't get
your sister to come.

1830
01:41:30,858 --> 01:41:34,292
I really tried.
I did everything that I could,

1831
01:41:34,326 --> 01:41:36,526
but she just...
she wouldn't listen.

1832
01:41:36,559 --> 01:41:38,459
I trust you did.

1833
01:41:41,426 --> 01:41:43,492
With everything that you did

1834
01:41:43,992 --> 01:41:45,959
for your father and your sister,

1835
01:41:45,992 --> 01:41:48,892
you are the bravest person
I've ever met.

1836
01:41:48,925 --> 01:41:50,426
You obviously
haven't met many people.

1837
01:41:50,792 --> 01:41:52,426
Just shut up.

1838
01:41:56,025 --> 01:41:58,959
You wouldn't have said that
a few months ago.

1839
01:42:00,792 --> 01:42:02,492
Yeah, well...

1840
01:42:02,526 --> 01:42:05,459

is just full of surprises.

I'm not signing that contract.

1847
01:42:52,892 --> 01:42:54,326
Here's the deal.

1848
01:42:56,292 --> 01:43:00,992
I'll do one more film
in the next six months.

1849
01:43:01,025 --> 01:43:03,326
And I don't care
how much money I make.

1850
01:43:03,925 --> 01:43:07,426
I'm not doing this for me
or for you.

1851
01:43:07,459 --> 01:43:09,226
I'm doing this
for the cast and crew

1852
01:43:09,259 --> 01:43:11,892
so they can prepare for life
after Steele Markov.

1853

That's my offer.
Take it or leave it.

As your manager...

1855
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:24,925
I have to warn you that this is

1856

you've ever done.

01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:15,025
in two months.

1908
01:51:18,426 --> 01:51:21,125
I went to that cemetery.

1909
01:51:22,825 --> 01:51:24,426
I told you I'd find it.

1910
01:51:24,459 --> 01:51:25,959
Thank you, Beckett.

1911
01:51:25,992 --> 01:51:27,092
Sorry it took me so long.

1912
01:51:27,125 --> 01:51:30,092
I had to search everyone
within a hundred miles of here.

1913
01:51:30,125 --> 01:51:33,125
I guess I was wrong.
Maybe I can trust you.

1914
01:51:33,758 --> 01:51:35,226
Well, you still look gorgeous

1915
01:51:35,259 --> 01:51:37,025
when you admit
that you're wrong.

1916
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,892
So, what did you find?

1917
01:51:40,925 --> 01:51:45,792
Well, four years ago,
my brother drew this picture

1918
01:51:46,326 --> 01:51:49,025
for this moment
when I needed it most.

1919
01:51:49,693 --> 01:51:54,392
I couldn't see it then, but...
I was never alone.

1920
01:51:56,526 --> 01:51:58,992
Well, sometimes things
aren't always as they seem.

1921
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:03,892
So...

1922
01:52:05,192 --> 01:52:06,758
I didn't sign the contract.

1923
01:52:07,792 --> 01:52:08,693
What?

1924
01:52:09,059 --> 01:52:11,092
I'm going to do one more movie
just to help everybody out,

1925
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:14,426
but then next fall,
I'm going to college.

1926
01:52:14,459 --> 01:52:18,426
Well, girls' hearts will be
shattered all over the world.

1927
01:52:18,459 --> 01:52:21,426
Well, there's only one girl's
heart that I care about.

1928
01:52:23,226 --> 01:52:25,025
No more double-life either.

1929
01:52:25,559 --> 01:52:28,159
Tomorrow, a story's going to hit
social media,

1930
01:52:28,192 --> 01:52:30,892
telling the world
that Taylor and I are done.

1931
01:52:31,092 --> 01:52:32,092
Finally!

1932
01:52:33,825 --> 01:52:35,292
I'm happy about it

1933
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:39,392
because there's a fair warrior
I wanna try and win back.

1936
01:52:55,925 --> 01:52:57,359
<i>of my exchange program
and went home.</i>

[woman] Where is it?

1938
01:52:59,825 --> 01:53:02,226
[Finely] <i>I told the conservatory
about Mrs. Sweeney,</i>

1939
01:53:02,259 --> 01:53:04,959
<i>and they allowed me to
audition after the deadline,</i>

1940
01:53:04,992 --> 01:53:06,226
<i>one final time.</i>

<i>I was accepted.</i>

1943
01:53:48,825 --> 01:53:50,259
<i>Beckett visited.</i>

1944
01:53:50,292 --> 01:53:52,892
<i>And of course, we crashed
my old high school's prom.</i>

1946
01:54:00,492 --> 01:54:02,326
[Finely] <i>That summer,
I went back to Ireland</i>

1947
01:54:05,025 --> 01:54:06,426
<i>And helped Beckett
with his lines</i>

1948
01:54:06,459 --> 01:54:07,725
<i>on his last</i> Dragon <i>film.</i>

1949
01:54:11,092 --> 01:54:13,025
<i>Beckett began college
in New York.</i>

1950
01:54:13,059 --> 01:54:14,825
<i>He's trying
to be a normal guy,</i>

1951
01:54:14,858 --> 01:54:16,359
<i>but he still needs
his disguises.</i>

1952
01:54:19,492 --> 01:54:21,792
<i>And, in autumn,
at the conservatory,</i>

1953
01:54:21,825 --> 01:54:22,992
<i>I played the violin.</i>

1954
01:54:23,392 --> 01:54:25,825
<i>Or fiddle,
as Seamus would say.</i>
