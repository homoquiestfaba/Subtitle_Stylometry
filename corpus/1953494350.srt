1
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,755
Now, you understand,

2
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:00,692
children... they react to
what goes on around them.

3
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,728
This is
not like Gabriel.

4
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,098
I don't mean to pry,
but I have to ask.

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,333
Are there problems
at home?

6
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,203
No. He's not acting out
or anything like that.

7
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,839
Not with him.
With the family.

8
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,376
Stan and I...
we're getting a divorce.

9
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,611
I see.

10
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,014
Gabriel shouldn't be punished
for what's happening at home.

11
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:25,050
He's not. He's being
punished for fighting.

12
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,052
Can't you make
an exception?

13
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,455
I wish I could.
School policy.

14
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,295
You should see this suspension
as an opportunity.

15
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:40,199
Talk to him.
Try to make him understand.

16
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,135
Divorces are never easy,

17
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,437
but they don't
have to be final.

18
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,056
You want to tell me
what happened?

19
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,625
I don't want
to talk about it.

20
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:18,130
Gabriel...
fighting? Why?

21
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,336
Things are difficult
enough around here

22
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,805
without getting a call
from your principal.

23
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,840
You broke Dougie's nose.

24
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,976
It'll be a miracle
if we don't get sued.

25
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,346
Are you listening to me?

26
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,148
I don't want
to talk about it!

27
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,417
I don't know what
I'm going to do with you.

28
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,600
What do you mean,
suspended?

29
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,768
I left three messages
at your office.

30
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,204
Well, I was working.
Yeah? I work, too.

31
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,240
Thank you, Susan.
I know you work.

32
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,208
You can't do me
the courtesy of waiting

33
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,876
until our divorce
is finalized

34
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,545
before you run around
with that woman.

35
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,880
I was working!
Do what you want!

36
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,849
Keep it down, okay?
Gabriel can hear.

37
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,918
There you go again,
trying to avoid the issue.

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,353
God, you are
driving me crazy.

39
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,555
You ruined my life!
Oh, yeah?

40
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:19,091
Well, that's a two-way street, sweetheart!

41
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,926
<i></i>

42
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,722
You okay?

43
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,224
Sure.

44
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,827
Heard you had
a scrap yesterday.

45
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,230
You want to tell me
about it?

46
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,537
Your mother tells me
you pushed that boy down

47
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,339
and broke his nose.

48
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,178
Hey. Look at me.

49
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,447
Fights happen.

50
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,049
It's what you do after
that matters.

51
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:02,120
What you learn from
the situation. Okay?

52
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:06,191
You know, fights don't always
have to be with other people.

53
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:10,862
Sometimes they're just problems that
<i>you're</i> <i>dealing with, you know?</i>

54
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,899
Do you know
what I'm saying?

55
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,568
Okay. Well, I gotta go.

56
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,971
You... stay out
of trouble.

57
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,384
Okay.
I gotta go to work.

58
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,486
I made you lunch,
it's in the fridge.

59
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,421
And you have mine
and your dad's numbers

60
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,723
in case of an emergency.

61
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,026
You gonna be okay
by yourself?

62
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,696
Why aren't you
shooting hoops?

63
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,932
Hey, Tully.
Don't feel like it.

64
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,968
I hear you.

65
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,337
It a holiday or something?

66
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,938
What?

67
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,707
It's a school day.

68
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,308
I'm suspended.

69
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,843
Ah.

70
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,346
I know about that, too.

71
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,882
What are you
escaping from?

72
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,717
You wouldn't
understand.

73
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,318
Try me.

74
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,021
I've developed
a list myself.

75
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:48,460
Responsibility,
problems, parents.

76
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,395
Yeah?

77
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,465
Always on my case
about every little thing.

78
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,001
"My house, my rules. "

79
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,671
My old man
always said that.

80
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,173
So what did you do?

81
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,109
What'd I do?

82
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,647
I left.

83
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,417
Hey, Tully!

84
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,487
Ah, gotta bolt.

85
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,676
Thanks for looking after him
while Stan and I work.

86
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,345
I'm close by.

87
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,114
Gabriel
doesn't fight.

88
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,350
He does now.

89
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,218
Recess.

90
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,787
How is he?

91
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,855
Him? He's fine.

92
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,692
Few scrapes.
Nothing bad.

93
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,226
And the other kid?

94
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,829
A broken nose.
Black eye.

95
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,766
I'm worried.

96
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,073
I'll talk to him.

97
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,376
He doesn't respond
to lectures.

98
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:15,213
Gabriel doesn't respond
to much of anything lately.

99
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,582
How are <i>you </i> doing?

100
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,317
I'm managing.

101
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,885
Is that enough?

102
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,287
What?

103
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,255
The kid...

104
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,091
He sees things,
I'm sure.

105
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,826
Hears things.

106
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,961
What's he supposed
to think?

107
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,932
Our marriage is over.
Of course we fight.

108
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,668
What couple doesn't
when it's all ending?

109
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,839
Sometimes we're loud.

110
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,243
Sometimes we're
really loud.

111
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,350
Don't get started.

112
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,419
This is hard enough.

113
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,321
I can't fight
a two-front war.

114
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,223
Neither can
a ten-year old.

115
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,359
There's more.

116
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,029
What? You're not gonna
send him to boarding school.

117
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,499
He has to choose.

118
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,167
What?

119
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,535
Who he wants
to live with.

120
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,103
It's only fair.

121
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,512
And I remember when math
was my only problem.

122
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,747
Talk to him.

123
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,726
I'm glad you're here.

124
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,629
Hey, I'm hiding from
the widow down the block.

125
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,831
How many apple cakes
can I eat?

126
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,299
Dad...

127
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,002
You're my daughter.

128
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,571
It's just us now.

129
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,708
No smoking.

130
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,043
You're not my mother.
Dad...

131
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,578
I told you, I quit.

132
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,814
Quit buying, maybe.

133
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,403
So how do you like
the Dodgers this year?

134
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,572
Ups and downs, right?

135
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,409
Did you know the Dodgers
originally played in New York?

136
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,180
I remember seeing them when
I lived in Brooklyn as a kid...

137
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:34,252
before they moved,
before I moved.

138
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:39,057
Moving someplace new is
always a jolting experience.

139
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,226
I mean, the hot dogs
don't even taste the same.

140
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,128
Grandpa.
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,963
My point is,

142
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,965
they picked it
back up again.

143
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,800
Ups and downs,
right?

144
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,002
That's what
life's all about.

145
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,273
Come here.

146
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,442
Am I in trouble?

147
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,078
When I was your age,
my grandfather...

148
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,382
your, what, great-
great-grandfather...

149
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,584
taught me how to spit
watermelon seeds.

150
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,319
Anybody ever
teach you that?

151
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,822
No.
Okay.

152
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,494
First, you take
a bite like this.

153
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,365
You work it in your mouth.

154
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,835
Try to get all the seeds

155
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,970
between your teeth
and your cheek.

156
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,842
And when all
the fruit is gone,

157
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,411
and the seeds
are all you got left...

158
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,348
you let her rip.

159
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,089
Now you try.

160
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,235
Not bad.

161
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,207
You know...

162
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,010
with all the seedless
watermelons they have now,

163
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,180
this is a dying art.

164
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,159
I got into a fight
the other day.

165
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,895
So I heard.

166
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,496
You aren't mad?

167
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,865
I didn't have
to duck any punches.

168
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:05,503
But now that you
bring it up, can I ask why?

169
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,405
I don't want
to talk about it.

170
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,840
Fair enough.

171
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,743
Mom and Dad say
I have to choose.

172
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,078
Choose?

173
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,747
Who I want to live with.

174
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,182
Oh.
Yeah.

175
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,353
You know they both
love you very much.

176
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,889
Lots of boys don't
have that luxury.

177
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,859
I want my parents
to live together.

178
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:32,430
I think you'll find that
what we want and what we get

179
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,933
are rarely the same thing.

180
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:40,972
Reminds me of a story that
my grandfather, your...

181
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,573
Great-great?

182
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:46,744
Good.
Grandfather, told me.

183
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,247
It was about...

184
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,382
Nah, skip it.
What?

185
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,284
Well, it's just
a stupid story.

186
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,253
Something you'd hear
before you went to bed.

187
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,221
You wouldn't be
interested.

188
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,957
Is it any good?

189
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,391
Well, I don't know.
I liked it.

190
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,428
But I like
adventure stories.

191
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,730
Heroes battling bad guys,

192
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,966
people dying,
worlds being saved.

193
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,002
But that's just me.

194
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,637
Tell it.

195
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,006
You sure?
Yeah. Tell it.

196
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,575
All right.

197
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,911
Is your mother
watching us?

198
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,817
No.

199
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,360
It's a habit.

200
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,595
Drink chocolate milk.
I'm lactose-intolerant.

201
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,997
But you eat ice cream.

202
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,265
You want to hear
the story or not?

203
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,807
Okay. Once upon a time...

204
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,642
Ah, jeez.
What's the matter now?

205
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,177
It's a fairy tale.

206
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,812
You're gonna tell me
a fairytale.

207
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,781
No, it is not
a fairy tale.

208
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,717
Well, not exactly.

209
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,285
Whatever.

210
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,821
Listen up.
You might learn something.

211
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,324
Okay.

212
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,292
Now, like all stories,

213
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:12,330
this begins in a place
and time not like our own.

214
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:15,299
There was a small village
on a distant planet

215
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,635
where simple folks
worked the land.

216
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,505
There was a boy
about the same age as you.

217
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,508
And he lived there
with his mother and father.

218
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,444
And the boy's name
was Nethiah.

219
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,382
But life, no matter
what galaxy you're in,

220
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,984
is made up of differences.

221
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,386
And while these people
lived in peace,

222
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,490
there are always those
who thrive on war.

223
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,662
The Strifers were savage.

224
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,531
What they saw, they took.

225
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,434
And those that resisted
were killed or enslaved.

226
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,202
And as they moved
across the land,

227
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,672
they conquered all those
who stood in their way,

228
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,842
regardless if they pledged
allegiance or rebellion.

229
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,677
What does that mean?

230
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,613
Whether they gave in
or fought back.

231
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,615
Oh.

232
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,751
Thoran was
the Strifer King.

233
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,619
He was ruthless,

234
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,888
with a hunger for everything
he set his eyes on.

235
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,758
And when his eyes fell
on the village,

236
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,962
the fate of Nethiah
and his family was sealed.

237
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,264
War is never
a good thing.

238
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,201
But when you're fighting for
your family, your community,

239
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,036
it takes on
a special meaning

240
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,039
because you're protecting
what's most precious to you.

241
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:33,044
Now, that day, the villagers
fought valiantly,

242
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,713
but they lost.

243
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:39,617
Many died,
including Nethiah's father.

244
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:44,889
Some were enslaved.
The lucky ones escaped.

245
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,891
Nethiah watched
as the Strifers

246
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,794
destroyed all that
he had come to know.

247
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,432
And the horrors that he saw
were too much for words.

248
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,901
Nethiah managed to escape,

249
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,671
and he found his mother
chained to a wall.

250
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,907
The Strifers
had captured her.

251
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,477
And they were slowly
feeding her a serum

252
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,513
that was poisoning her.

253
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,522
He wanted to help
his mother,

254
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,090
but there was nothing
he could do.

255
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,825
He was too small,

256
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,995
too weak to separate her
from those machines.

257
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,365
No. Come here,
come closer...

258
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,368
She told him to leave.
She loved him so much

259
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,203
and she knew that
if he was captured,

260
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:37,008
he would be forced to work
in the mines, or worse.

261
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,211
There's nothing
for you here now.

262
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,346
Do you understand?

263
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:53,124
I want you to listen to me
very, very carefully.

264
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:58,129
I want you
to close your eyes.

265
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,466
Shut them very tightly.

266
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,708
And do not open them
till I tell you.

267
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,144
Now, stand up.

268
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,146
Stand up!

269
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,718
Do not open your eyes.

270
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,092
Leave me now!
You must go!

271
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,328
You must go
or you will die here.

272
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,698
Do you understand?
Now, go!

273
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,600
And do not look back,

274
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,602
no matter what
you hear!

275
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,308
Don't worry for me,
my son.

276
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,113
I will always
watch over you.

277
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,451
So what did he do?

278
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,053
He took a secret tunnel
and found the pipeline

279
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,089
that would lead
outside his village.

280
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,925
And when he climbed up
out of that pipe,

281
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,693
he was free.

282
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,362
So he made it?

283
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:08,132
Unfortunately, no.

284
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,301
He didn't.

285
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,137
Something stopped him.
He just couldn't do it.

286
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:17,541
He couldn't leave those
who meant the most to him.

287
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,076
So he went back.

288
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,646
And the Strifers
captured him.

289
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,781
Oh, he fought
like a wildcat.

290
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,483
He made the Strifers
earn it.

291
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,719
But in the end,
he was still a boy,

292
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:33,424
and these were the strongest
creatures in the galaxy.

293
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,327
They beat him mercilessly,

294
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,363
until he finally
passed out.

295
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,502
What? Why did you stop?

296
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:47,171
I got places to go,
people to see.

297
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,573
But I'll look in on you
while your parents are out.

298
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,275
But what about
the story?

299
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,010
Hey, slow down, kiddo.

300
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,512
It's just a fairy tale,
remember?

301
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,847
It's way better.
Really?

302
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,150
Well, then maybe
I'll come back tomorrow.

303
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,985
That sound good?

304
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,520
Yeah.

305
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,155
Grandpa?
Yeah?

306
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,957
I hit that boy
the other day.

307
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,093
I hit him first.

308
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,828
I heard.

309
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,596
You did?

310
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,198
Kids fight.

311
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,933
He made of fun of me.

312
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,202
Oh. Well, then
he deserved it.

313
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,605
He said I was gonna be
one of those divorce kids.

314
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,107
He's right.

315
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,642
I know.

316
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,178
Thing is,
he's my best friend.

317
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,046
Was.

318
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,882
Well, I'll tell you
something.

319
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,819
Kids make fun of things
that they're afraid of,

320
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,054
what they don't understand.

321
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,724
Adults do, too.

322
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,392
I guess.

323
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,363
Come on,
let's take this inside.

324
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,298
I haven't eaten
this much watermelon

325
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,367
since my prostate
was your age.

326
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,268
Your what?
Never mind.

327
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,045
My father's going to watch
Gabriel while we're at work.

328
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,247
Your father?

329
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,583
Yes, my father. Someone's
got to get through to him.

330
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,151
I talked to Gabriel.

331
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,320
Yeah, I know how
you talk to him.

332
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:10,988
Oh, stop. Susan,
I talk to the kid, okay?

333
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,357
My father has a way.
He's a good man.

334
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,559
He's a hard-ass.
Excuse me?

335
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,927
You know what
I'm talking about!

336
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,829
Whenever he speaks
his mind,

337
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,031
he has no internal censor!

338
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,100
Since when did telling the
truth become such a bad thing?

339
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,735
I'm going to my room.

340
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,771
Yeah, walk out,
like you always do!

341
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,571
Can I come in?

342
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:01,872
Yeah.

343
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,052
Hey, kiddo.

344
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,889
We haven't really
talked very much

345
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,425
about what your dad and I
are asking of you.

346
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:24,161
I know it must seem like we
dropped a ton of bricks on you,

347
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:27,331
but it's really important
that you know why.

348
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,067
Whatever problems your dad and
I are having are between us.

349
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,670
They have nothing
to do with you.

350
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:36,006
We both had an equal part in
bringing you into this world,

351
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,976
and we both
love you very much.

352
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,744
Does that make sense?

353
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,313
I guess.

354
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,893
Take your time
with the decision.

355
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,711
You know, when two people
get married,

356
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:18,015
divorce is the furthest
thing from their minds.

357
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,652
You have children,
you raise a family,

358
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,088
make a better lot in life.

359
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,392
But along the way,

360
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,862
life tends to throw in
a curveball or two.

361
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,733
You and mom don't love
each other anymore.

362
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,235
No.

363
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,803
No, we don't.

364
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,141
Well, not the way
we used to.

365
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,776
Then in what way?

366
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,547
Well...

367
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,652
look, I'm gonna
tell you this because...

368
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,054
I think you're old enough
to understand it.

369
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,190
When I first met your mom,

370
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,928
it was like nothing else
I had ever felt before.

371
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,097
It was like... you know how
when you're running real fast

372
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,733
and you gotta stop because
you gotta catch your breath?

373
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,569
It was like that.

374
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:15,239
Only that's how I felt
every time we were together.

375
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,174
And when we got married,
there wasn't a day

376
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,843
when the sun didn't rise
and set with her.

377
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,580
But sometime
in the last year,

378
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,348
I stopped
loving your mother

379
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,417
the way I used to
when we got married.

380
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,720
And I can't explain why...
I wish I could...

381
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,623
but one morning
I just felt it.

382
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,259
And, here's the thing
about falling in love

383
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,529
that no one ever tells you,
but I'm telling you now...

384
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,364
you can always
fall out of it.

385
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,870
I don't understand.

386
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,606
Well, you will, buddy,

387
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,407
when you get
a little bit older.

388
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,810
Trust me.

389
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:57,047
Now, as far as who
you're gonna live with,

390
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,883
that decision
is completely up to you.

391
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:03,287
And your mom and I aren't gonna
try to sway you in any way.

392
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:06,323
We both love you very much.

393
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,060
How will I know if you're
gonna fall out of it?

394
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,731
You little grubber-ish...
yah!

395
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,968
That kind of love...

396
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,204
no parent ever
falls out of.

397
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,808
All right. Now,
you give that a whirl.

398
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,016
Come on.

399
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,343
Looks like you could
use a cold soda.

400
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,281
Hey, Tully.

401
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,224
You got the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

402
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,061
I can tell.

403
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,063
You got that look.

404
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,831
What look?

405
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,634
It's the way
you carry yourself.

406
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:28,038
That hunched-over, "I can't put
anything else on my shoulder" look.

407
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,373
It's that obvious?

408
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,208
Know what helps
with that?

409
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,810
Give me the ball.

410
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,553
Follow me.

411
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,590
Come over.

412
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,165
For whatever reason,
shooting free throws

413
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:58,001
always helped me
to get my mind straight.

414
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,748
You play a lot.

415
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,751
In school.

416
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,687
Starting point guard for
a team that went to State.

417
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:20,424
We lost but,
we had a fun ride.

418
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:27,364
Now I only mess around
when the mood hits me.

419
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,246
Here, why don't you
give it a go?

420
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,781
Uh, I don't play.

421
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,451
It's not playing,
it's shooting.

422
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,953
Cheapest therapy
I know.

423
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,055
Here, take it.

424
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,728
Hold the ball
like this.

425
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,898
Bring it over
your head like so.

426
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,734
Keep your eye
on the back of the rim.

427
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:05,569
That's what
you're aiming for.

428
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:08,071
You aim for the front,
you'll brick the shot for sure.

429
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,807
Now, when shooting...

430
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,142
your left hand
guides the ball,

431
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,745
while your right hand
propels the shot.

432
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:18,081
Always, always,
always follow through

433
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,917
with your
shooting hand.

434
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,685
Why?

435
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,188
Hell if I know, kid.

436
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,357
It's what the coaches
always said.

437
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,092
Go ahead, give it a try.

438
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,001
Sweet!

439
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,779
You want to talk
about it?

440
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,915
My parents
are splitting up.

441
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,386
The "D" word.

442
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,891
I should have known.

443
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,861
So which one are you
gonna live with?

444
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,630
That's the thing.
They want <i>me </i> to decide.

445
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,832
Ah, hell.

446
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,968
Excuse my French.

447
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,704
That's a hard place
to be in.

448
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:16,974
I'll tell you this.
You're not the first kid

449
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,710
whose parents got
the big "D".

450
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,678
Great. I feel
so much better now.

451
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,882
I'm serious.
It stinks, but it happens.

452
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,417
It'll be hard,
but it's livable.

453
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,586
What makes you
so sure?

454
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,321
Why do you think
<i>I </i> left home?

455
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,657
Just because they can't
live with each other

456
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,592
doesn't mean they can
live without you.

457
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,561
How am I gonna
make a decision

458
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,730
without hurting
one of them?

459
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,666
You can't.

460
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,902
Someone's going
to get hurt.

461
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,571
I'll tell you
something else.

462
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:48,906
They're scared.

463
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,240
Scared of what?

464
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,210
You're the glue now, kid.

465
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:58,181
You can keep them as close
or as far apart as you want.

466
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,686
You understand?

467
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,257
So this is where
you've been hiding out.

468
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,359
Who's this?

469
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,061
Grandpa,
this is Tully.

470
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,329
Tully, my grandpa.

471
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,066
Nice to meet you, Grandpa.

472
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,834
Nice to meet you.

473
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,806
I gotta go
pick up some trash.

474
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,808
I'll catch you later.

475
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,418
You know him?

476
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,920
He's a friend of mine.

477
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,956
I don't like him.

478
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,391
You don't know him.

479
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,226
Didn't know bin Laden,
either.

480
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,761
You want
an ice cream cone?

481
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:45,896
Yeah.

482
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,998
Let's go.

483
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,637
Grab your stuff.

484
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,712
You better hurry up or
I'm gonna eat yours, too.

485
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,084
So are you gonna
continue the story?

486
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,386
Sure. Just let me
sit down first.

487
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,589
Come on!

488
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,692
Okay. Where were we?

489
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,295
When Nethiah got captured
by the Strifer King.

490
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,197
That's right,
he got captured.

491
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,332
But they didn't
enslave him.

492
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:26,203
No. They did
something much worse.

493
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:29,740
They made him
into a pit fighter.

494
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,111
The young boy grew
into a strong man.

495
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,513
And they taught him
how to fight,

496
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,448
kind of like the gladiators
of ancient Rome.

497
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,050
And did he learn.

498
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,852
He was the best.

499
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,488
400 times they lowered
him into the pit,

500
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,892
and 400 times he raised
his arm in victory.

501
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,997
The only time he was allowed
to leave his cell

502
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,567
was to train or fight.

503
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,505
And for the longest time,
that's all he knew.

504
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:05,876
He became like an animal,
like a savage,

505
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:10,180
as savage as the Strifers
who had locked him up.

506
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:13,550
And one day, suddenly,
something changed.

507
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,652
What?
He had enough.

508
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,387
He reached his limit.

509
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,923
He just couldn't
do it anymore.

510
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,659
The fighting,
the death.

511
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,228
He was a man at
the end of his rope.

512
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,831
There comes a time
in everyone's life

513
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,667
when a decision
has to be made,

514
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,570
and Nethiah made it...
no more fighting.

515
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,840
When they came for him,

516
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,575
he refused
to leave his cell.

517
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,277
He didn't care what
the consequences were.

518
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,179
He was finished.

519
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,514
Nethiah was given
a choice.

520
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:49,553
Fight, or be taken
to the Strifer King,

521
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:53,023
a fate that no one had
ever returned from alive.

522
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,895
That was when
he met Sir Hanif.

523
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,098
He was a freedom fighter

524
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,635
who had been silenced by the
Strifers in a terrible way.

525
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,537
How?

526
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,340
They wired
his mouth shut.

527
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,612
<i>Come here. </i>

528
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,148
You speak with
your mind. How?

529
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,984
<i>A lost art</i>
<i>known to a few. </i>

530
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,553
Sir Hanif seemed to want
to help Nethiah,

531
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,323
but suddenly,
he stabbed him.

532
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,592
How come?
Why didn't he help him?

533
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:31,128
Well, in a way,
he <i>did </i> help him.

534
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,663
He awakened
Nethiah's anger,

535
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,499
and when Nethiah
was angry,

536
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,234
he was strong.

537
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,605
Hanif! Why?
why did you do this?

538
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,406
<i>To set you free. </i>

539
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,575
I don't understand.

540
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:49,079
You said... You said
you were going to help me.

541
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:53,850
<i>Soon, you will feel</i> <i>the
strength</i> <i>flowing in you. </i>

542
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:58,121
In a way, Sir Hanif was...

543
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,457
his savior.

544
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,659
He showed Nethiah
what a person can do

545
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,462
if he believes
in himself,

546
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:10,133
if he sees
the truth in things.

547
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:14,504
You see, Sir Hanif used
to be a great warrior, too,

548
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,007
and friend to
the Strifer King.

549
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,842
But when he finally
saw the evil

550
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,377
that lurked in
the king's heart,

551
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,945
he made a decision.

552
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,282
He refused to serve
the king anymore.

553
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,317
So he was imprisoned

554
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,219
and forced to fight
in the pits.

555
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,688
Just like Nethiah.
That's right.

556
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,692
Nethiah made
his own decision.

557
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,228
It was better to die
fighting for his freedom

558
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,830
than to live as a slave.

559
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,001
And Sir Hanif came
to that same conclusion.

560
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,037
In one final charge,

561
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,906
he attacked the Strifer guards
outside the prison cell.

562
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,579
Now, Sir Hanif succeeded
in defeating the guards,

563
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:59,149
but time had slowed
his fighting ability.

564
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:03,987
It was a victory
that cost him dearly.

565
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,658
Hanif!

566
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,329
<i>Go... before the rest of</i>
<i>the Strifers get here. </i>

567
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,898
No, we'll go together!
<i>No, Nethiah. </i>

568
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,935
<i>This is a journey</i>
<i>for you, and you alone. </i>

569
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,870
We can make it,
both of us!

570
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,607
<i>But I am</i>
<i>already free. </i>

571
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,742
I... I don't understand.

572
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,779
<i>I'm soon to be outside</i>
<i>these prison walls</i>

573
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:33,717
<i>in both mind and body. </i>

574
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,686
<i>But your path is</i>
<i>far more dangerous. </i>

575
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,388
My path?

576
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,757
<i>To the Strifer King. </i>

577
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,294
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>I awakened your soul. </i>

578
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,364
<i>Use it against him,</i>
<i>for both of our sakes. </i>

579
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,799
Hanif, I don't know
how to...

580
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,901
<i>You do, Nethiah. </i>

581
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:55,605
<i>Use my blade,</i>
<i>and take this. </i>

582
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,875
Sir Hanif gave Nethiah
an amulet...

583
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,910
a good-luck charm...

584
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,146
saying only that
it would protect him.

585
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,149
But... But how
will it protect me?

586
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,386
<i>Have faith, Nethiah. </i>

587
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,721
<i>Have faith. </i>

588
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:15,792
I... I will try.

589
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:20,397
<i>My strength</i>
<i>is leaving me. </i>

590
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,565
<i>Now go. </i>

591
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,801
<i>Go and find yourself</i>
<i>and your purpose. </i>

592
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,570
<i>Let the blade and</i>
<i>the amulet guide you. </i>

593
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:30,774
<i>Defeat</i>
<i>the Strifer King... </i>

594
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:34,444
<i>and free... our... </i>

595
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,246
<i>people. </i>

596
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:39,582
Sir Hanif made
the ultimate sacrifice.

597
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:43,153
So Nethiah... he fought his way
through guard after guard.

598
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,789
But he was bleeding from
the cut in his side.

599
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,658
And when he thought
he could go no further,

600
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,462
he finally found what he
was looking for... a way out.

601
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:53,863
Did he?

602
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,465
Did he what?

603
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,800
Grandpa!
Did he make it?

604
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,635
Oh, well, yeah.

605
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,103
Sort of.

606
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,272
Sort of?

607
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,543
He was the on the verge
of passing out

608
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,845
from loss of blood
when...

609
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,113
When?

610
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,482
A stranger found him.

611
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,452
A mysterious woman saw
his weakened condition

612
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,320
and helped him up.

613
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,856
She was unlike anyone
he had ever seen before...

614
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,727
beautiful, with eyes the color
of the setting sun.

615
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,962
When Nethiah woke up,

616
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:29,966
he had no idea how long
he had been sleeping.

617
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,035
And the woman
hovered over him.

618
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,505
And he was scared at first.
She was not an ordinary woman,

619
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:39,943
she was someone...
something... magical.

620
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,016
Where am I?

621
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,419
You do not know?

622
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,324
Keep your distance.

623
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:56,826
Why?

624
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,901
Do you intend
to harm me?

625
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,140
What are you?

626
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:16,079
I am a Sorqan!

627
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,484
What is a Sorqan?

628
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,189
I am made up of
many organisms...

629
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,658
but I take the form
of only one.

630
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,764
I am known
as Naran Anie.

631
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,135
Why am I here?

632
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,173
I do not know.

633
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,909
I must go.

634
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,812
No!

635
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:54,117
Wouldn't you rather
stay here with me instead?

636
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,786
I am in need of company.

637
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,255
And being the last of her kind,
alone all the time,

638
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,990
Stay with me...
drove her mad.

639
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,725
...forever.

640
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,661
She begged Nethiah
to stay with her,

641
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,397
but he was determined
to leave.

642
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:09,432
And that was when
the amulet saved him.

643
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,135
Aaaaah!

644
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,270
Do you know
what an amulet is?

645
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,072
A good-luck charm?

646
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,141
Good boy.

647
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:22,078
It was a charm passed down
from ancient times.

648
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,114
It represented hope, courage,

649
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:28,184
the power
to start things anew...

650
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,254
just as Sir Hanif
had started anew

651
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,823
when he turned against
the Strifer King...

652
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,693
that if this woman
survived the Strifer attack,

653
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:39,963
maybe there were other
survivors from his own village

654
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,265
hiding somewhere.

655
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:45,835
So he walked and searched
for many days,

656
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,937
to the point of exhaustion.

657
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,440
And when he thought
he could walk no more,

658
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:53,943
he saw something
very strange...

659
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,678
a hole in the ground.

660
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,380
But it was no ordinary hole.

661
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,716
It was black as night.

662
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,318
And, when Nethiah
reached his hand in

663
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,687
to see what he could find...

664
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,224
Oh.
Grandpa!

665
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,693
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll get you another one.

666
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,028
But something
grabbed him,

667
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,997
and it was
very scary.

668
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,634
Nethiah wrenched his hand free
from the terrible grip

669
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:21,070
just as these terrifying
creatures emerged.

670
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,256
Who were they?

671
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,859
Survivors.
He found them?

672
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,828
Not only that.
He found his family.

673
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,432
Well, I think that's
about it for today.

674
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,067
Grandpa!
Nap time!

675
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,602
I don't take naps.

676
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,170
Who's talking
about you, kiddo?

677
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,738
Wait till you get
to be my age.

678
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,240
Naps are the best
friend you have.

679
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,109
Come on, let's
get you inside.

680
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,344
Hi, Mom.

681
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:02,679
Oh, you made a mess!

682
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,414
I'll take care
of it.

683
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,782
Can I ask you
something?

684
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,417
What's wrong Dad?

685
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,752
Have you heard
of a guy named Tully?

686
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,867
Where is my phone?

687
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,936
Honey, have you seen
my cell phone?

688
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,406
Oh, here. Heh.

689
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,375
Remember what
I said, Gabriel.

690
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,143
Yes, Mom.

691
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:37,046
No strangers.

692
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,482
Okay, I won't talk
to strangers.

693
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,427
So you're home.

694
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,766
Your father worries
too much.

695
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:39,335
I checked around. That
Tully kid is harmless.

696
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,104
He's a bad influence.

697
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:45,041
Huh. No worse
than our arguing.

698
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,909
You're preparing
the papers?

699
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,613
Well?

700
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,683
Well what?
It's confusing.

701
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:56,686
I told you.
You need to hire a lawyer.

702
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:59,489
At those rates?
I'll just invest the time.

703
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,171
I need closure, Stan.

704
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,709
I need to know why.

705
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,125
Our problems started long
before she came into the picture.

706
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,595
She was an effect,
she wasn't the cause.

707
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:42,565
Who is it, Stan? Don't you
think you owe me that, at least?

708
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,734
What difference
does it make?

709
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:46,469
You don't know her.

710
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,172
We met. It happened.
End of story.

711
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,474
That's life, isn't it?

712
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,676
What, does that have some
kind of hidden meaning, Susan?

713
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,278
It means just as I said.

714
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,246
But you're free to think
whatever you want.

715
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:00,082
That, right there... that's
what I'm talking about Susan!

716
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,951
What? What are we
talking about, Stan?

717
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:04,520
You get to this point
and you just cut out,

718
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,455
like I'm supposed to know
what's going on inside your head!

719
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,791
Isn't that what marriage is
supposed to be about? Huh?

720
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:11,127
Knowing what
each other's thinking?

721
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,596
Finishing each other's
sentences, and so on and so forth?

722
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:16,432
Don't mock me.
Don't you mock me!

723
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,100
You were with
another woman, and I...

724
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:22,705
Only after. Only after
it was over between us!

725
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:24,440
You stepped away
from this marriage

726
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,542
long before I ever
stepped out on you,

727
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:28,477
and now this ten-year
mistake is finally over.

728
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,112
Our son is not a mistake!

729
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:32,915
Oh, stop it!
I love my son!

730
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,320
I love Gabriel.

731
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:39,155
And I know
you love him.

732
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,157
He's the best thing
that ever happened to us.

733
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,625
This has nothing
to do with him

734
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,994
and everything
to do with us.

735
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:47,997
He belongs with me.

736
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:50,166
Maybe.

737
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,802
But we decided to let
him make up his own mind.

738
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,503
And no matter
whom he chooses,

739
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,839
we're gonna respect
his decision.

740
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:58,541
We're gonna respect it
and honor it,

741
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,276
for his sake.

742
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,648
I know.

743
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,988
And about us...

744
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,056
don't go looking for
answers to questions

745
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,159
that, in the end, aren't
going to satisfy you.

746
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,232
You're a bastard.

747
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,477
I know.

748
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,906
<i>You're going to be</i>
<i>one of those divorce kids!</i>

749
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:38,474
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

750
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,343
<i>Yes, you are!</i>
<i>Take that back!</i>

751
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:43,446
<i></i>
<i>Ow!</i>

752
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:44,847
<i>Ow!</i>

753
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,983
<i>Ow! Uhh!</i>

754
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,035
<i>Come here. </i>

755
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,405
Uhh!

756
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,137
Mom!

757
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,640
One second, Gabriel.

758
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,977
What is it, honey?
Have to go.

759
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:49,979
Where you gotta go? I'll
take you after breakfast.

760
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:52,648
No, I have to go.
Dad's using my bathroom.

761
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,216
Sure.

762
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,922
Hey. We're in this
together.

763
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,191
We gotta take care
of each other, okay?

764
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,759
Okay.

765
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,716
Hey.

766
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,618
Hey.

767
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,887
How's school?

768
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,190
My mom said I shouldn't talk to you.

769
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:35,958
I figured.

770
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,063
Come on, Doug.

771
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:42,698
I gotta go.

772
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,708
I saw Doug today.

773
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,446
Refresh my memory.
Who's Doug?

774
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,483
My friend. The kid
I punched in his eye.

775
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:02,651
Oh.

776
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:05,154
I wanted to say something,
but I couldn't.

777
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,623
Well, it'll come
when you're ready.

778
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,494
I don't know.

779
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:14,063
Forgiveness
is a difficult thing.

780
00:52:14,065 --> 00:52:16,665
But I think you'll find most
people are willing to do it,

781
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,767
if you give them
the chance.

782
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:22,404
Take Nethiah. When he finally
found his mom and dad again...

783
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:25,007
Wait, I thought
they got killed.

784
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,409
Well, yes and no.

785
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:29,178
You see, it wasn't
really them,

786
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,980
just fakes that
the Strifers created

787
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,848
to trick Nethiah.

788
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,585
You watched us die
and did nothing?!

789
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:38,521
No. I... I was young.

790
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:40,689
But even though
they weren't real,

791
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:44,126
Nethiah couldn't control his
feelings when he saw them.

792
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:47,029
You deserve to die
for betraying us!

793
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,931
When they started
attacking him,

794
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,033
he could have fought back,
but he didn't.

795
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,435
He took their blows
over and over again.

796
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:56,138
And when he could
take no more...

797
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,040
he did the only thing
that he could do.

798
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,808
What?

799
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,312
He took out
his amulet.

800
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:04,613
There was nothing
I could do.

801
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,115
Liar!

802
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,685
That will not
help you now!

803
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,055
It didn't seem to help.

804
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,725
Nethiah could fight
no longer,

805
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:19,862
and he surrendered
to a dark sleep.

806
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,301
Wait, that's it?
That's the end?

807
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,236
No, not quite.

808
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:30,172
Suddenly, there was
a bright light

809
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:31,840
all around Nethiah.

810
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,742
Didn't you
hear me calling?

811
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,578
We're in the middle
of a story.

812
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,379
It's good, Mom.

813
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,014
Well, put it on hold.
Dinner's on the table.

814
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,683
But...
Gabriel.

815
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:42,384
Okay.

816
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,953
To be continued.

817
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,396
Come on, Grandpa.
Can you give me a hint?

818
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,931
What's gonna happen?

819
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,000
Is Nethiah gonna fight
the Strifer King?

820
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:00,936
Good things come
to those who wait.

821
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,272
Um, excuse me.
Wash up.

822
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,474
And wash their hands.

823
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,179
How's, uh...
how's it going?

824
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:12,014
It's going.

825
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:15,684
Has Gabriel said anything
to you about um, you know.

826
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,386
Has he given you any hints?

827
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,954
He hasn't, and I
haven't been asking.

828
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,589
What do you mean,
he hasn't said anything?

829
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,192
Susan,
you're my daughter

830
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:24,627
and I love you.

831
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,862
But if this was
some idea of yours

832
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:29,265
for me to spend time with
Gabriel so I could spy on him,

833
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:31,467
you're going
to be disappointed.

834
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,869
Is that so bad?
Am I absolutely horrible

835
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,038
for wanting to know
what my son is thinking?

836
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,140
No, you're not horrible. But
you gave him the lousy task

837
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:39,975
of choosing
between parents.

838
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,377
At least give
the kid some space

839
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:42,778
to figure
things out.

840
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:50,319
So what have you two been
talking about all this time?

841
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:51,954
You know, things.

842
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,889
Things?
What kind of things?

843
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:57,159
You wouldn't be
interested.

844
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:58,494
Try me.

845
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,266
Hey, Gabriel, does your
mom know what a Strifer is?

846
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:06,168
Are you kidding me?

847
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,605
See? This is strictly
on a need-to-know basis,

848
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:12,341
and you don't need to know.

849
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:16,111
Gabriel, your grandfather
has lost his mind.

850
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:21,650
Who's saying Grace...
you or the crazy man?

851
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,323
All right.
Lord, please...

852
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:29,425
give us a more
understanding daughter.

853
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:31,026
I mean mother.

854
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:33,362
When is the last time

855
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:35,130
you spent any time
with your son?

856
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:36,832
I saw him today.

857
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,300
Last week, we did the...
the bike thing.

858
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,169
We're going
to the park tomorrow.

859
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,970
Last week. You want him
to live with you so bad,

860
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:43,472
you spend
no time with him.

861
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:45,307
Look, stop.
Stop. Okay?

862
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,710
I came to get my sweatshirt.
I'm going out for a drive.

863
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,378
You got to hawk
all over the balcony...

864
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,347
Go for your drive.

865
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,382
You just stay
off my back!

866
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,380
Come on, give me more!

867
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,586
Yes!

868
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,727
Let's sit down.

869
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,042
I think you got Larry Bird
coming to your house,

870
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,611
giving you lessons.

871
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:57,679
Who?

872
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,416
You're kidding, right?

873
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:04,420
Larry Bird?
The Bird Man?

874
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:08,424
Only about the greatest
basketball player ever.

875
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:11,727
I thought
Michael Jordan was.

876
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:16,198
Well, yeah, but before
Michael, there was Larry Bird.

877
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,535
One of the 50 greatest
players of all time.

878
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,740
Come on, you gotta know
who I'm talking about.

879
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:29,044
I told you I didn't know
a lot about basketball.

880
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,512
You want to hear a story?

881
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,982
I met him.

882
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,784
Really?

883
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,253
An All-Star game.

884
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:40,656
Three-point contest.

885
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:43,559
He was behind,
and as time ticked down,

886
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:45,594
he started raining them in.

887
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:51,733
On his last shot,
after he released the ball,

888
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:56,004
he turned his back to the net
and walked off the court,

889
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,575
with his index finger
pointing in the air.

890
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:03,111
Gabriel, he didn't
even see the shot go in,

891
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:06,248
but he knew.

892
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,484
Wow.

893
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:13,255
I stayed around after,
when he was signing autographs.

894
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:15,991
He signed my ball.

895
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,694
My most prized possession.

896
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:25,100
No matter how broke I get,
that piece never sells.

897
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:29,104
Some things are worth
more than money.

898
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,772
You got that?

899
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:32,474
Yeah.

900
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:34,276
How's your friend doing?

901
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:38,146
Doug? Okay, I guess.

902
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:40,682
It's tough
when friends fight.

903
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,619
You think it'll
never happen, but it does.

904
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,988
I didn't want
to hit him.

905
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,856
It just
sort of happened.

906
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,192
He was saying things,
and I got mad.

907
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:54,229
I don't remember even
throwing the punch.

908
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:56,431
He's my best friend.

909
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:02,704
Thing is, best friends are
best friends for a reason.

910
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:06,475
A good friendship
can survive anything.

911
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:11,213
So what do I do now?

912
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,850
What do <i>you</i>
<i>want to do?</i>

913
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,952
Tell him I'm sorry.

914
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,722
Sounds like a plan to me.

915
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,209
Hey.

916
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,612
Hey.

917
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:45,681
Whatcha doin'?

918
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,283
Nothing.

919
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:49,785
Yeah, me, too.

920
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,954
How's the eye?

921
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:54,389
It can be like this
for another week or so.

922
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:56,458
Does it still hurt?

923
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,261
Not anymore. It looks
worse than it is.

924
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,198
What?

925
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,100
I don't know.
It makes you look tough.

926
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,468
Yeah?

927
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,437
Yeah. Like a boxer
or something.

928
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,238
Guess what?
What?

929
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,141
Mary Peterson asked me
about it yesterday.

930
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,977
Mary Peterson?
What'd you say?

931
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:16,578
Said it was nothing.

932
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,280
She thought I was
being mysterious.

933
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,148
She left a note
in my locker.

934
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,950
No way!
Way.

935
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,486
Dude, she's, like,
a year older than us.

936
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,388
I know!
Glad I could help.

937
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,729
<i></i>

938
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,210
<i></i>

939
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,250
Need to be a friggin' NASA
scientist for these games.

940
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,456
Something's wrong
with this game.

941
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,158
I can't get it working.

942
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:07,362
You have to hit
the color buttons

943
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:10,332
when it goes to a circle
and strum at the same time.

944
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,270
Isn't it easier
to just play the guitar?

945
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,973
Didn't they have video games
when you were a kid?

946
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:20,776
Yeah. They were
called "sports. "

947
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,344
And where were you?

948
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:25,047
Taking a shower.

949
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,615
Before that.

950
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,316
Playing ball with Tully.

951
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:33,488
Ah. I see.

952
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,457
Then I made up with Doug.

953
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:38,493
Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

954
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:43,498
Look, uh, this guy...

955
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,168
Tully is his name?

956
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,203
I don't think that's
the kind of person

957
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,805
you want to be
spending time with.

958
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,406
Why not?

959
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,975
Well...

960
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:56,812
there are three kinds
of people, Gabriel...

961
01:01:56,814 --> 01:02:00,549
the good, the bad,

962
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:04,553
and the ones that were good
but went bad along the way.

963
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,722
I think this Tully
might be the third type.

964
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:08,557
You don't even know him.

965
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,493
That's true. It's just
a feeling I get.

966
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:17,999
I'd hate to see you getting,
you know, influenced.

967
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:20,569
If, I'm wrong,
I'm wrong.

968
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:23,338
I just want you
to be okay.

969
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:29,778
You ever heard
of Larry Bird?

970
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,280
Who hasn't?
I'm surprised you have.

971
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:33,615
Why do you ask?

972
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:35,083
No reason.

973
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,020
Are we okay?

974
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,456
Yeah.

975
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,892
Old age, kid.

976
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:46,261
Makes you want
to make sure

977
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,797
that all those you love
are taken care of.

978
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,799
Wait'll you get
to be 40 years older.

979
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:52,934
But that's, like,
a million years away.

980
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,004
Yeah.

981
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,441
Are you gonna
finish the story?

982
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,443
I was thinking about
getting some coffee.

983
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,245
I'd rather
hear the story.

984
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:07,482
Oh, you would,
would you?

985
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:08,850
You can't smoke inside.

986
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:28,069
Okay. So where were we?

987
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:31,239
When Nethiah found
his parents and it got ugly.

988
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:35,143
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

989
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:38,113
Well,
as it turned out,

990
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,081
his amulet
did save him.

991
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,083
As he lay beaten,

992
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:44,853
he entered
a dreamlike state,

993
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:47,489
and his mother came to him, his real mother.

994
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,831
I'm not here
to harm you.

995
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,269
My son.

996
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,041
You must listen to me
very carefully.

997
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:12,047
You are the last hope
of our kind.

998
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:19,354
These creatures
manipulated your mind.

999
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,157
They are committed
to destroy us.

1000
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,861
This place...

1001
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:29,497
is not of your own memory.

1002
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:32,834
It's something
they have created.

1003
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:35,103
You must rely on faith.

1004
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,810
This represents
something forgotten.

1005
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:54,723
I told you once
to close your eyes.

1006
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,128
I ask you now
to open them.

1007
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,399
Fight the overlord.

1008
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:08,570
Break free from the confines
they have created in your mind.

1009
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,239
Open your eyes, my son.

1010
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,775
Be nameless no more.

1011
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:22,884
For you are...

1012
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,754
Nethiah.

1013
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,857
It was then he knew
that to put things right,

1014
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:32,360
he had to drive
the Strifers out of the land,

1015
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:36,464
to avenge his parents
and to set his people free.

1016
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:44,706
I have not...

1017
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,808
forgotten.

1018
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:51,746
Now, he would have to
fight their evil king,

1019
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,615
which meant he would
probably be killed.

1020
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,753
Striving for a goal,
a really difficult one,

1021
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:01,656
takes more courage
and inner strength

1022
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:03,658
than anyone suspects.

1023
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,962
In these moments,
your character is formed.

1024
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:08,663
Whether you
achieve it or not,

1025
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:12,167
success is measured
by how hard you try.

1026
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:15,170
And Nethiah tried hard.

1027
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,138
He sought out
the Strifer King.

1028
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,608
Everywhere he went, there were
signs of his presence,

1029
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,144
but no king.

1030
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:26,948
He was starting to wonder
if Thoran was just a story

1031
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,950
made up to keep people
in line.

1032
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:33,621
So Nethiah freed settlements
from Strifer imprisonment

1033
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:38,126
to send a message
that he was looking for Thoran.

1034
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:39,995
The Strifers
went to their king

1035
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:42,130
and told him how they were
losing the control

1036
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:46,868
that they had ruthlessly
enforced for 20 years.

1037
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,771
The king was impassive.

1038
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:54,542
He paced as he listened
to their stories of Nethiah...

1039
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,012
that he was fierce,
unstoppable.

1040
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,447
And the more his legend grew,

1041
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,283
the more his people stood up
against the Strifers.

1042
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:06,454
He inspired them,
strengthened them.

1043
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:11,626
The king said nothing.

1044
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:14,662
But he didn't harm
his followers for failing

1045
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,698
as they feared he might.

1046
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,133
How come?

1047
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:20,135
How come what?

1048
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:21,536
How come he didn't
punish them?

1049
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,338
Ah, good question.

1050
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,340
There comes a moment

1051
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:29,677
when the inevitable
is gonna happen.

1052
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,380
And the king knew that.

1053
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,483
You can't enslave
a people forever.

1054
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,819
At some point, they're
going to rise up.

1055
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,954
And that moment was now.

1056
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,293
The big battle
was about to begin.

1057
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:52,434
It was a fight
that they both wanted...

1058
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:54,269
and got.

1059
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:57,172
Now, to give you
some perspective...

1060
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:59,541
throughout history, there
are only a few battles

1061
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:03,611
that compare to what Nethiah
was about to go through.

1062
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:06,881
The Battle of Thermopylae,
where 300 Spartans

1063
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:10,852
fought against millions
of their enemy;

1064
01:08:10,854 --> 01:08:15,056
the gladiator uprising
against the Romans;

1065
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:18,760
and Horatius Cocles'
lone stand on the bridge,

1066
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:22,263
protecting Rome against
the invading Etruscans.

1067
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,700
And there was the battle
between Nethiah

1068
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:29,070
and the Strifer King.

1069
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:32,574
First, he had to get through
the king's best warriors.

1070
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:36,744
And they came at him
with everything they had.

1071
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:39,747
Strifers are vicious
fighters, relentless,

1072
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,382
with one purpose
in mind...

1073
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:45,153
to vanquish their foes
or die trying.

1074
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:49,424
Throughout history,
none had been able

1075
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:53,595
to stand up to them,
until now.

1076
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:56,164
Nethiah had honed
his fighting skills

1077
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,299
as a pit fighter

1078
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,468
against the fiercest
in the galaxy.

1079
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,605
400 times he had been
lowered into that pit,

1080
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:06,741
and 400 times
he had come out alive.

1081
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:09,010
And back then, he was
only fighting for survival.

1082
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:12,747
Now he was fighting
for his people.

1083
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:16,317
One by one, he killed
the Strifer warriors

1084
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,122
until only he
and the king remained.

1085
01:09:21,124 --> 01:09:23,458
The challenge
was issued.

1086
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,493
Everything was riding
on this fight.

1087
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:28,830
If Nethiah died, the
Strifers remained in power.

1088
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,632
If the Strifer King
perished,

1089
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:35,103
then Nethiah's people
would go free.

1090
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:36,871
When the king asked
by what right

1091
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:38,540
did he make
this challenge,

1092
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:42,143
Nethiah smiled
and showed him his...

1093
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,978
Amulet!

1094
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,147
Right.

1095
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,616
The amulet was more
than just a symbol.

1096
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:51,553
It had survived wars,
famine, disease.

1097
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:54,956
Simply put, it was hope.

1098
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:58,193
Hope that wrongs
could be righted.

1099
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:02,130
And that was something
that the Strifer King

1100
01:10:02,132 --> 01:10:04,465
never wanted to see.

1101
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:07,835
Now, Thoran looked up
at the stars,

1102
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:11,839
searching for an omen
of the battle to come.

1103
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,042
Some people believe that
fate is written in the stars,

1104
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:16,177
and that by studying
their positions,

1105
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:18,680
we can see
what's to come.

1106
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:23,151
Now, maybe Thoran didn't
know how to read the signs,

1107
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:28,323
or maybe he just was trying
to change what they meant.

1108
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:31,926
Either way, their battle
came down to a duel of wills

1109
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,728
between two great warriors,

1110
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,231
each determined
to prove their resolve

1111
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:38,700
and fighting skills.

1112
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:43,037
Thoran's moves
were effortless.

1113
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,942
He fought with a grace that
belied his size and his age.

1114
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,581
Now, Nethiah, on the other
hand, fought like an animal

1115
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,050
who tore at the bars
of his cage to get free,

1116
01:10:56,052 --> 01:11:00,021
fighting with strength
and single-minded conviction.

1117
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:03,691
Every time
he was beaten down,

1118
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,527
Nethiah found
his feet again.

1119
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,535
When you're fighting
for the fates of many,

1120
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:18,873
it can either weigh you down
or raise you up.

1121
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,476
On and on
the fight went,

1122
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:24,445
punching and blocking

1123
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,047
and thrusting

1124
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:29,384
and kicking,
kicking, kicking!

1125
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:31,152
I mean, for a while,

1126
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,388
it seemed that they were
too evenly matched.

1127
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,257
But then Nethiah
started to tire,

1128
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:40,328
and he realized he was going
to have to change his game plan

1129
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,730
if he was going to
beat the Strifer King.

1130
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:47,168
So you know what? He decided
to climb up the rock face,

1131
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,904
thinking that Thoran
wouldn't bother to pursue him.

1132
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:52,640
But he did! He did.

1133
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:56,411
And, as Nethiah climbed
higher and higher,

1134
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:58,279
he was getting
more and more tired.

1135
01:11:58,281 --> 01:11:59,814
And he turned back,

1136
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,983
and Thoran was getting
closer and closer.

1137
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,018
On and on
the battle went,

1138
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,121
until it just
seemed pointless!

1139
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,856
Grandpa!

1140
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,193
It's nothing, kiddo.

1141
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:15,763
I just got a little
winded for a second.

1142
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,533
You mind if we
finish this later?

1143
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:21,369
Yeah. Come on, let's get you
a glass of water.

1144
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,414
Hey. You Gabriel?

1145
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,816
Yeah?

1146
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:19,153
This is from Tully.

1147
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,959
Where is he?

1148
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,296
I don't know.
Quit. Fired.

1149
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,565
Who knows?

1150
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:33,100
He said
to give you this.

1151
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,069
What is it?

1152
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,972
I just deliver.
I don't read the mail.

1153
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,927
This is killing me,
Stan.

1154
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:37,798
Look,
it is what it is.

1155
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,567
Let's just move
forward, okay?

1156
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:41,903
Let's do our best to
keep this thing going

1157
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:44,038
in a salvageable
direction.

1158
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,475
Salvageable? You think
this is salvageable?

1159
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:50,645
Yes, for Gabriel.
Don't you dare.

1160
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:54,015
Don't you dare offer up
our son as justification.

1161
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:57,051
Don't you see
what you've done to me?

1162
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,986
I have no pride.

1163
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:01,856
Do you know what it's like
to walk into a grocery store

1164
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:03,858
and see the women shopping

1165
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,193
and not know if they're
judging me or not,

1166
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:08,329
not know if they've
heard the rumors,

1167
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:10,498
thinking the whole time
that one of them might be her?

1168
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,899
Susan...

1169
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,035
Susan, nothing.

1170
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:16,737
Hey, kiddo.

1171
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,272
What are you doing
out here?

1172
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,176
Oh.

1173
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,448
Whatcha got there?

1174
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,050
A basketball.

1175
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,718
Yeah, well,
thanks for confirming

1176
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,286
that my eyesight
is still in check.

1177
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:33,387
Take a look.

1178
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:35,356
Oh, is that real?

1179
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:37,925
Yep.

1180
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,227
Where did you get this?

1181
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,964
It's a good-bye gift
from a friend.

1182
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:44,899
Really?

1183
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:46,734
Yeah.

1184
01:16:46,736 --> 01:16:48,603
Must have been
a good friend.

1185
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:50,605
He is.

1186
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,807
I guess I was wrong.

1187
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,310
You okay?
Yeah.

1188
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:02,717
Because if you remember,
when we last saw Nethiah,

1189
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:03,951
he was not
in very good shape.

1190
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,486
Go on.

1191
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:09,056
As they locked
in their death match,

1192
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:11,459
Nethiah remembered
the amulet.

1193
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,427
He struggled to reach it,

1194
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:15,162
as if just by touching it,

1195
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:17,298
it might give him the strength
that he needed.

1196
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,433
The king had other plans.

1197
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:21,836
He struck Nethiah
with a mighty blow,

1198
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:23,137
sending him to the ground.

1199
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,607
Well,
Nethiah was stunned,

1200
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:27,975
disoriented.

1201
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,410
Before he could
collect himself,

1202
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:31,512
the Strifer King
was upon him.

1203
01:17:31,514 --> 01:17:34,582
In the king's grasp,
Nethiah felt the years

1204
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:36,250
of Strifer oppression.

1205
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:38,252
No matter what he did,

1206
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:40,354
he couldn't break
the hold.

1207
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:43,691
His very breath was being choked out of him.

1208
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:47,928
And then
something happened.

1209
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,530
As he struggled
for life,

1210
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:53,701
Nethiah saw the amulet
on the ground.

1211
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:56,370
And suddenly, everything
that it represented

1212
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:59,940
manifested in his being.

1213
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:03,778
Slowly, he grasped
Thoran's arms

1214
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,846
and, in an agony
of determination,

1215
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,649
he pried loose
from the death hold.

1216
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:10,284
Thoran was stunned.

1217
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:11,952
No one had ever
escaped, not like that,

1218
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:14,188
not with
so much conviction.

1219
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,624
Well, the battle
had turned.

1220
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:18,893
Nethiah
was unleashed.

1221
01:18:18,895 --> 01:18:22,029
He attacked with
unrelenting fury...

1222
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:25,466
kicks, punches, throwing
everything at the Strifer King

1223
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:27,568
with such
blinding speed

1224
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,537
that he could do
nothing but retreat,

1225
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:35,676
until Nethiah had
Thoran on his knees.

1226
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:38,479
The boy who had been forced
to work in the pits to survive

1227
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:40,981
now had the cause
of his enslavement

1228
01:18:40,983 --> 01:18:43,751
on the ground
before him.

1229
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,089
The king looked up
at Nethiah.

1230
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:49,890
He didn't beg
for his life,

1231
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,259
as some say he did.

1232
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,895
He didn't bargain
with Nethiah

1233
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,998
or make promises
in exchange for mercy.

1234
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,668
He simply bowed his head

1235
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:03,771
in a gesture of respect.

1236
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,576
He submitted to
Nethiah's raised fist

1237
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:10,578
one final time

1238
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,115
before Nethiah erased
the past 20 years

1239
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:16,851
in one crushing blow!

1240
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,789
The battle was over.
Yes!

1241
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:24,959
The Strifers had lost.

1242
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:28,896
In that moment, Nethiah
was changed, reborn.

1243
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:30,898
He emerged
from the darkness

1244
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,067
in a burst of glory.

1245
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:35,102
He could do so now.

1246
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:40,040
He had earned the right
to step into the sun.

1247
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:42,443
Wow.

1248
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,645
The end.

1249
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,716
That was a really
good story, Grandpa.

1250
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:50,417
You think so?

1251
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:52,453
Not just
a goofy fairy tale?

1252
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,455
No.

1253
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:57,091
I think it has
something for everyone

1254
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,293
if you know
where to look.

1255
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,631
So you're suspension
is almost over.

1256
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:05,332
You ready to get back
to school?

1257
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,834
Yeah.

1258
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:08,435
Good.

1259
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:11,172
But, I still have
a big decision to make.

1260
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:13,440
You'll make
the right one.

1261
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,442
Choices
are important.

1262
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:17,144
You make a choice,

1263
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,346
and it says something
about who you are.

1264
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,982
Nethiah made
a choice, right?

1265
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:25,085
And right now, I choose
to get you inside

1266
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:28,189
before your parents
get worried.

1267
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,864
I used to be happy, Stan.

1268
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:44,705
I used to be happy
and content.

1269
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:48,976
Now I am broken up inside,

1270
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:52,947
and the pieces
don't make sense.

1271
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:56,884
And I'm not the only one
in this marriage, you know.

1272
01:20:56,886 --> 01:21:00,321
It takes the two of us,
not just me, not just you.

1273
01:21:00,323 --> 01:21:03,557
And you used to know that
when we were younger,

1274
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:06,827
but you are wrapped up
in your work.

1275
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:09,730
Maybe I should wait.

1276
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:11,732
You could.

1277
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:15,069
You could wait till tonight
or tomorrow,

1278
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:18,239
but maybe those won't be
good times, either.

1279
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,674
Keep waiting,
and in the meantime,

1280
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:23,177
your parents are
going at it all the time.

1281
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:27,248
It's never going
to be a good time.

1282
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,484
Or you can man up and...

1283
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:33,254
and get it over with.

1284
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:35,289
It's your choice.

1285
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:39,326
Have you made a decision?

1286
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,028
Yeah.

1287
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,230
Then, go tell 'em.

1288
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,099
I'll be right here.

1289
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,517
Do you-

1290
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:07,421
do you remember when
we were in school?

1291
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,426
We had dated two years.

1292
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,628
Graduation was coming up.

1293
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,433
The night before
finals were over,

1294
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:23,037
do you remember
what you said to me?

1295
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,173
No.

1296
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:35,616
You said I had the softest
eyes in the world.

1297
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:38,419
You said that you knew
you fell in love with me

1298
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:40,321
the moment you saw my eyes,

1299
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,458
that I was
the woman for you,

1300
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,361
that we were meant
for something special.

1301
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:56,437
Tell me,
how do they look now?

1302
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:58,138
They look sad.

1303
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,109
Hey, buddy.

1304
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:03,644
We were
just talking.

1305
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,079
Everything's fine,
honey.

1306
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:07,314
Everything's not fine.

1307
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:10,084
Everything hasn't been fine
in a long time.

1308
01:23:10,086 --> 01:23:12,820
What? You don't think
I've noticed it?

1309
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:15,656
Buddy, come here.

1310
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,993
Let me just...
Let me finish!

1311
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,340
When you guys told me you
were getting a divorce,

1312
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,776
I felt like I was
gonna throw up.

1313
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:38,545
And then you both came to
me and told me to choose.

1314
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,381
I'm ten.

1315
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:41,982
What am I supposed
to think?

1316
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:44,451
Oh, honey...
I'm not done!

1317
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:47,688
Well,
I made my choice.

1318
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:51,291
But I'm not gonna
tell you.

1319
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,527
That's all I have
to say.

1320
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:12,746
So how'd it go?

1321
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,248
Okay.

1322
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,650
Okay is good enough.

1323
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:19,053
So what do you want now?

1324
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,188
An ice cream sundae with
lots of whipped cream.

1325
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,756
Doable.

1326
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,427
So what happened
to Nethiah

1327
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,062
after he killed
the Strifer King?

1328
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:30,597
Oh, that's
another story.

1329
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:33,400
Have you seen the size
of a double fudge sundae?

1330
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,936
Well, then we'll have
lots of time, won't we?

1331
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:39,907
Come on!
I'm coming.

1332
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,178
Too bad I'm
lactose-intolerant, though.

1333
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,612
But you eat ice cream.

1334
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:47,381
Oh, that's right, I do.

1335
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:48,749
Well,
that's good.

1336
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,818
Get off the street!
Sorry.

1337
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,688
So can I live with you?

1338
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:55,923
Sure.

1339
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,458
Just for a while?

1340
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,526
As long as you need.
Great.

1341
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:01,195
I'm not cleaning up
after you.

1342
01:25:01,197 --> 01:25:02,963
I'm neat.

1343
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:05,065
I mean, no spitting
watermelon seeds at my house.

1344
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:06,867
Hey, you're the one
who taught me.

1345
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:08,569
So what are you having again? Double fudge?

1346
01:25:08,571 --> 01:25:10,070
Double fudge sundae.

1347
01:25:10,072 --> 01:25:11,371
I thought you liked
butterscotch.

1348
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:13,040
No.

1349
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,741
When you were younger,
you liked butterscotch.

1350
01:25:14,743 --> 01:25:16,243
No, that was when
I was younger.

1351
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:18,112
That's what
I just said.

1352
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:19,880
