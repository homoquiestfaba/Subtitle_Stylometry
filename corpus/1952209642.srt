1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,480
In eighteen eighty-seven,
Abraham Van Helsing...

2
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,146
began the Vampire Recordio,

3
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,492
a chronicle of the history of vampires.

4
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,303
The first entry details Lilith,

5
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,908
...the most powerful and evil vampire
to ever walk the Earth.

6
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,544
A cruel and spiteful creature,

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,442
Lilith gained control
of the Vampire High Council...

8
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,886
Premo super thee per valde ferinus.

9
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,023
Forcing them to pay homage to her.

10
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,519
But the vampires rebelled.

11
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,966
They captured Lilith,

12
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,833
and placed her on trial
before the vampire elders.

13
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,136
Too powerful to destroy outright,

14
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,578
the vampires, led by Lord Drakulya...

15
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,684
...used the nos ferate amulus.

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,777
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

17
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,285
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

18
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,214
We banished her from our world.

19
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,756
The amulets,

20
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,949
containing her wicked essence,

21
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,952
were scattered around the globe.

22
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,565
Please, I command you.

23
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,200
For centuries,

24
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,602
they lay dormant.

25
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,610
Until now.

26
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,646
Hey, Willie.

27
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,778
What's up, man? How's it goin'?

28
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,113
Oh, good, good, good.
I'm just leavin' right now.

29
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,479
The ship is yours.

30
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,884
- All right, Willie. I'll see you later.
- All right. Just, uh...

31
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,492
...lock up, on the way out.

32
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,489
Ooh, a lucky penny.

33
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,926
See ya.

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,717
Oh shit.

35
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,058
Hey, you can't park there.

36
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,665
Yeah? I just did.

37
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,360
Asshole.

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,074
Be out in a second.

39
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,579
Take your time.

40
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:45,784
Just, uh...

41
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,380
...checkin' out your wares.

42
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,646
Hi. Can I help you?

43
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,557
Wow.

44
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,286
Felix was right.

45
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,524
You are gorgeous.

46
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,356
No wonder he didn't get
anywhere with you.

47
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,797
I told your secretary,

48
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,799
and your lackey last week
that I wasn't interested.

49
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,300
I know you did.
But you didn't tell me.

50
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,769
- Okay, I'm not interested.
- Look.

51
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,271
Due to some generous incentives
by the city to clean up this area...

52
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,310
I can offer you now ten percent
more than Felix did.

53
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,575
- I'm not interested.
- And, additionally...

54
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,147
I'm gonna give you
a ten thousand dollar moving fee.

55
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,822
Completely separate from escrow.

56
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,822
All right, it's just something
from me to you.

57
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,688
- I'm not interested.
- Alex.

58
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,727
Ms. Layton.

59
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,161
Ms. Layton.

60
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,357
I've spent millions of dollars securing
all the properties in the area.

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,067
Save yours.

62
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,445
The city doesn't wanna let me
break ground unless I...

63
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,176
I can prove to them that this
development project is gonna work.

64
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,511
This is my mother's shop.

65
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,911
She left it to me.

66
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,518
I am not gonna just give it to some...

67
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,687
...cap
- This offer is more than three times...

68
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,516
...the value of your property.

69
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,554
You know that.

70
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,419
With that money you can buy a house
in the Garden District,

71
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,530
...or and a vacation home.
- I don't take vacations.

72
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,555
And I don't want a house
in the Garden District.

73
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,529
Uh, you're getting in the way
of progress, lady.

74
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,693
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,996
I really am. But I'm happy here.

76
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,204
It's people like you that make
capitalism needlessly difficult.

77
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,133
You know what?

78
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,845
Call me when you come to your senses.
All right?

79
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,174
Oh. Oh, oh. And the moving allowance...

80
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,114
...is only good for tonight. All right?

81
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,082
At midnight, forget about it.

82
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:33,725
Mr. Bayne?

83
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,558
I think you're in danger.

84
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,390
Excuse me? Wait, wait, wait.

85
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,795
- Did you just threaten me?
- No, I...

86
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,569
I sense things. And...

87
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,367
Right. The, uh...

88
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,803
...the cult bookstore psychic B.S.

89
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,004
- But thanks though.
- Seriously. I...

90
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,581
Hey! Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,446
- Fellows, please, please, please.
- I told you not to park there.

92
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,651
I know.

93
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,135
Thanks for stopping.

94
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,680
Well, you didn't really give me
much of a choice.

95
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,576
My car, my cell phone,
everything's dead.

96
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,275
- I thought I hit somebody, but now the
- Calm down.

97
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,282
Calm down. I'll call for help for you,
but I can't stick around, all right?

98
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,445
I'm in a hurry.

99
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,884
CarStar Center, this is Natalie Wright.
How may I help you, Mr. Bayne?

100
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,792
Uh, yes, hi. Um, there's a lady stuck
on the side of the road here.

101
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,125
- I think her car stalled.
- Okay, sir.

102
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,757
Do you have any idea
what's wrong with her vehicle?

103
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,492
Don't know, don't care.

104
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,639
OnStar treats roadside assistance
cases as emergency situations.

105
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,636
I'll take care of this for you right away.

106
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,035
All right. Thank you.

107
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,498
All right. Help's on the way.

108
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,644
All right.

109
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,009
Thanks for stopping.

110
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,806
Good morning, Mr. Bayne

111
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,646
The nurse mentioned
you were wakin' up.

112
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,616
You were unconscious
for forty-eight hours.

113
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,691
How do you feel?

114
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,524
What happened?

115
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,358
Well, that's what we'd like
to find out from you.

116
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,569
Look at my finger.

117
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,073
Now the police
will want to speak to you.

118
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,386
Why did I get out of the car?

119
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,687
- Oh, my.
- What?

120
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,198
It still hurts like hell.

121
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,365
Well, you have severe muscle damage.

122
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,797
You'll have to have a few sessions
with the physical therapist.

123
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,803
Look, I really don't have the time
to spend a couple 'a days a week...

124
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,637
...in an office full of invalids.

125
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,645
All right, Mr. Bayne

126
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,978
You'll need to sign a against
medical advice form.

127
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,675
Thank you.

128
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,190
Bayne and Associates. Can I help you?

129
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,591
Oh, oh, hi Ms. Johnson.

130
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,568
No, I'm sorry, I haven't heard anything.

131
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,228
Russell, are you okay?

132
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,500
Are you doin' okay? I heard about you.

133
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,601
Yeah, well...

134
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,272
- I've been better.
- I was so worried about you.

135
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,537
- I tried to visit the hospital.
- Did, uh...

136
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,375
...did you get those plans from the city?

137
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,310
Yes. They're on your desk.

138
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,888
Mr. Bayne, could you open this, please?

139
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,616
How you feelin', boss?

140
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,351
Hey, did that Layton
woman happen to call?

141
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,186
She's hot, right?

142
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,057
Look, would you focus
for a millisecond?

143
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,528
Did she call?

144
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,259
- No.
- Damn it.

145
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,200
We're gonna have to redraw
all the plans...

146
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,303
and go through that whole dog
and pony show with the architects...

147
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,496
...if we don't break ground
by the summer.

148
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,767
And we're gonna lose Starbucks.
They want the space on Junction.

149
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,933
I'll deal with that.

150
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,670
Are you sure that
we've done everything? I mean...

151
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,881
can't you slip some cash
into the fire marshal's hands or...

152
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,313
...or have her place condemned?
- I've tried it all, man.

153
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,617
She's smart, that one.
And has a ridiculously perfect ass.

154
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,725
I think she cursed me.

155
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,958
- What?
- Before I left...

156
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,526
I think that bitch cursed me.

157
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,196
She said that I was in danger,
and then I had the accident.

158
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,263
Mr. Bayne.

159
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,502
Yes? Uh...

160
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,637
Felix.

161
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,372
I'm Detective Ladd.

162
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,369
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about what happened.

163
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,467
Yeah. Uh, please, come in.
Have a seat.

164
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:02,948
Thanks.

165
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,982
So...

166
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,379
did you know the victim?

167
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,053
No.

168
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,548
She, uh, she flagged my car down.

169
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,685
I, uh, s- called for roadside
assistance for her.

170
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,963
- What attacked her and you?
- I have no idea.

171
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,658
I wish I did.

172
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,766
It was just like, uh...

173
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,501
it was like a coyote or a...

174
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,037
wolf, or...

175
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,734
...a, a bear. Only he was a, bigger
and, a- and faster.

176
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,237
I'm tellin' you man, this whole thing
happened so fast.

177
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,609
Why'd you get out the car?

178
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,480
I have no idea. S- stupidity.

179
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,648
You know, thinkin' that
I could do somethin'.

180
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,745
Being a good Samaritan
is never a bad thing.

181
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,557
Missing two days of work and havin'
an f'ed up back's a good thing?

182
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,723
Sorry for your inconvenience.

183
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,664
- It's fine.
- Look, if you happen to...

184
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,394
...remember anything, give us a call.

185
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,430
The direct line
to the homicide department.

186
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,837
Homicide?

187
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,207
What, doesn't that imply murder?

188
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,481
- Emily Van Becks was D.O.A.
- Yeah, and, yeah, no kidding.

189
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,047
That was an animal attack.

190
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:17,450
Until the forensic pathologist can figure
out what type of animal it was...

191
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,880
...it's with us.

192
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,017
What do you mean? What...

193
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,990
What you don't have some type
of teeth or hair samples?

194
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,664
Wha- I was kind'a lookin' forward
to you guys tellin' me what it was.

195
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,164
So far it's all inconclusive.

196
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,768
None of the samples found at the scene
match DNA of any known animals.

197
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,240
So maybe you got attacked by Big Foot.

198
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,739
Or a werewolf.

199
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,310
Uh, yeah.

200
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,384
Yeah.

201
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,620
Good day, buddy.

202
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,719
Yeah. You too.

203
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,751
Xandrea.

204
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,363
Zaifira.

205
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,019
Hello, Alex.

206
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,485
It's been a while.

207
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,921
Not long enough.

208
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,521
There's no need for a gun.

209
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,458
Interestingly enough, I,
I feel more comfortable with it.

210
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,400
MacPherson.

211
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,605
Bravo.

212
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,105
Ease up on the gun, shall we, love?

213
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,414
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

214
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,579
One of the amulets has been stolen.

215
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,246
- The amulets?
- Yes.

216
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,648
And the clans are restless.

217
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,287
What do you want with me?

218
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,947
We can't confront them just yet.

219
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,560
There's a treaty between us
and the vampires in place.

220
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,161
And since you are no longer
one of us...

221
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,592
...you're not bound to it.
- I left for a reason.

222
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,328
This is your problem. This is not mine.

223
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,942
A world of darkness
is all of our problems.

224
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,678
I'll keep my ear to the ground.

225
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,119
You know where to find us.

226
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,297
With three boys running
around the house all day...

227
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,632
...obviously,
I don't get much time for myself.

228
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,865
And the last thing that I wanna be
doing is cleaning up after them.

229
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,602
That's why I use Skeet - Skeet.

230
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,844
Skeet - Skeet on the stovetop
and all over the counter.

231
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,646
You can use Skeet - Skeet
in the bathroom.

232
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,777
Skeet - Skeet on seat seat.

233
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,084
You can Skeet - Skeet everywhere.

234
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,025
And now a Skeet - Skeet
furniture question.

235
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,127
Damn it.

236
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,559
What's going on? I'm dreaming.

237
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,324
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

238
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,130
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,165
Come in.

240
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,400
Shut the door.

241
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:01,804
What's up?

242
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,574
What's that, uh, guy's name, the...

243
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,438
problem solver? You know, when you...

244
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,205
...need somethin' to sort of disappear?

245
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,581
Oh... Leo's guy. Oh, what's his name?

246
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,642
- DePinto.
- That's it. Uh, get me his number.

247
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,684
- What happened?
- Nothing.

248
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,420
What did you do?

249
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,952
Look. I just have a situation
I need cleaned up,

250
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,625
and I don't want to have
to explain it to anybody

251
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:25,387
- Dead hooker. It's a dead hooker.
- No.

252
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,331
If I wanted you to know, then I'd 'a had
you take care of it, all right?

253
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,725
Just get me his number.

254
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,071
I'll be on my cell.

255
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,281
Hello?

256
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,515
Hey Dad.

257
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,484
Yeah.

258
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,184
I know.

259
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,219
I know Stanford's a better school,
but for my major.

260
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:30,726
I know.

261
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,555
Dad, you just don't understand.

262
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,557
Okay. I know.

263
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:48,396
Back for more?

264
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,966
I'm still not interested.

265
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,211
What'd you do to me?

266
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,026
- How did you do that?
- Get the hell out of here.

267
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,254
- You shouldn't be able to do that.
- Leave now...

268
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,729
...or I'm calling the cops.
- You're a witch.

269
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,565
You, you did something to me.
And I want you to stop.

270
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,364
Okay, I'm not a witch.
And I did nothing to you.

271
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,436
Yes you did.

272
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,608
You sent that thing to me,
and now I am one.

273
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,544
What'd you just say?

274
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,474
Look, I don't need
your stupid shop, okay?

275
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,404
I promise just, just, just make it stop.

276
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,038
- Russell, wait.
- Make it stop.

277
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,296
Oh, hey... could I get another...

278
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,566
Damn it.

279
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,241
I was a little disappointed you didn't
want me to come over last night.

280
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,638
It's a good thing you didn't.
No, it would have been...

281
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,077
...a complete disaster.

282
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,481
Why?

283
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,983
Are you seeing somebody else?

284
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,653
No. No. It's just...

285
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,288
Have you ever...

286
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,525
...not felt like yourself?

287
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,665
You know, like...

288
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,328
...like your whole life's changing?

289
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,636
From the inside out?

290
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,798
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

291
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,972
You do?

292
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:04,639
Yeah.

293
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,672
I love you too.

294
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,784
- Go ahead, you can say it.
- Oh. Hey, great. Food.

295
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:14,985
Thanks.

296
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,321
Thank you.

297
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,557
You used to always order
your steaks medium well.

298
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,357
Oh. What an idiot.
Didn't know what I was missing.

299
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,556
You're avoiding me now.

300
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,432
You're avoiding me,
why don't you just say it?

301
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,204
Say what?

302
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,007
I'm an idiot. I'm, I'm sorry.

303
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,509
Come on. Don't, don't leave. Just...

304
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,914
Come back inside. Please.

305
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,585
- I'm sorry.
- No you're not.

306
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,121
It's just the way you are.
And that's fine.

307
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,288
I was silly to think I could change you.

308
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,086
All right, just please.
Just come back inside.

309
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,990
I'll see you in the office on Monday.

310
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:01,931
Really?

311
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,599
Fine.

312
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,840
Four dogs please.

313
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,565
- Hello.
- Hey there, good lookin'.

314
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,907
Hi.

315
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,139
We know who you are.

316
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:49,743
- How's that?
- You are Russell Bayne.

317
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,706
- Yes, I am.
- Why don't you come with us?

318
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,116
Okay. Well, is this some sort
of joke or something?

319
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:00,315
- Very funny Felix.
- We will explain everything.

320
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,550
Okay.

321
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:04,795
Get in.

322
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,561
- Oh, nice car.
- Yeah.

323
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,997
Um, yeah, uh...

324
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,494
ti- I really, really, uh, need to...

325
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,833
...gotta go, I gotta go take care
of my tab, all right?

326
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,437
Uh... give me, two seconds. I swear.

327
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,404
Um, do I need an ATM?

328
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,547
I mean, is this one
of those sort of deals?

329
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:27,444
- No. Don't be silly.
- It'll be fun.

330
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,847
I'm sure it will be.
Uh, look, I'll just be right back, okay?

331
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,089
Two, two seconds. Two seconds.

332
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,295
My car is parked out front,
you're gonna wanna get in.

333
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,599
Oh, God.

334
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,042
- Not you again.
- See your friends out there?

335
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,268
They're bad news.

336
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,143
I'll take my chances.

337
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,691
Leave me alone.

338
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,017
Hey, come on.

339
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,686
I wanna sell.

340
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,760
No B. S?

341
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,695
All right, shake on it.

342
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,053
Where is he?

343
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,524
We tried to bring him here.

344
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,795
She has found him
and is protecting him.

345
00:32:56,507 --> 00:33:00,637
There was no point in turning him
if he is not on our side.

346
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,645
It is no matter.

347
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,517
All will be complete soon enough.

348
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,423
She may be able to protect him
for a while.

349
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,597
But no one can protect him
from the Goddess.

350
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,129
What year is it?

351
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,303
Your majesty.

352
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,472
We serve at your pleasure.

353
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,882
And your service shall be rewarded.

354
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,578
What year?

355
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,682
You have been away for over
four hundred years...

356
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:48,116
...your highness.
- Four hundred years.

357
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,354
I shall make my captors pay.

358
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:57,134
Many are dead.
Drakulya, Ravencroft, Bathorly.

359
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,828
All passed.

360
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,494
The others are weak.

361
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,602
They feed off of rats...

362
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,934
and live in fear of the humans.

363
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,610
Then we shall make the humans fear us.

364
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:14,643
And dispose of all
who stand in our way.

365
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,977
- What the hell is goin' on?
- That's what we're here to find out.

366
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,886
The vampires want you for something.

367
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,613
That's why they sent those
two there tonight.

368
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,691
So you're sayin' my accident
wasn't an accident?

369
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,061
There's no such thing as accidents.

370
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,266
- Oh. You're not makin' any sense now.
- Try it.

371
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,525
Try what?

372
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:05,968
Change.

373
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:07,895
I can't do that.

374
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,706
Yes you can.

375
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,805
You're not really trying.

376
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,776
Come on. You do it then.

377
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,678
Come on. Lead by example.

378
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,516
Demonstrate for me.

379
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,320
Come on. Change.

380
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,807
I haven't changed all the way in years.

381
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,841
That's the point, Russ.
You can control it.

382
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,847
- How long have you been...
- Nine years.

383
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,548
- You haven't found a cure for it yet?
- I don't wanna find a cure.

384
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,158
- It's a gift, Russell, it's not a curse.
- A gift I'd like to exchange.

385
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,418
But you can't.

386
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,557
Now I wanna help you.

387
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,523
I will help you.

388
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,568
So that you can learn
to use it the way that I have.

389
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,633
Use what?

390
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,106
There's a lot for me to tell you.

391
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,036
There's a world out there
that very few people see.

392
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:25,580
A dark world that exists side by side
with the normal world.

393
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,585
I kinda like the normal world.

394
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,816
You've been given an opportunity,
Russell.

395
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,688
And with our gift comes many things.

396
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,562
Powers.

397
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,594
Responsibilities.

398
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,324
Enemies.

399
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,602
Well, see, th- that's exactly
what I don't need.

400
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,029
More enemies.

401
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,365
Look. Let me explain somethin' to you.

402
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,566
Getting in that car was the biggest
mistake I ever made.

403
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,206
I'm usually a pretty selfish prick.

404
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,869
- It's worked pretty well for me so far.
- You could be so much more.

405
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,380
You're makin' me out to sound
like some kinda superhero or somethin'.

406
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,985
You are so much more.

407
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,016
I gotta get outta here.

408
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,126
Russell.

409
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,358
I have progressed as far as I can
without your assistance.

410
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,903
And you have done
so without our consent.

411
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:26,807
- Your actions will bring repercussions.
- Repurcussions, that will affect us all.

412
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,740
We need not fear anyone.
The goddess...

413
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,576
The goddess
cannot be controlled or trusted.

414
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,082
That is why we disposed of her
so long ago.

415
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,081
We have peace now.

416
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,520
Bringing her back will reignite the war
with the humans.

417
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,487
A war that we will surely win.

418
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,525
You are forbidden from proceeding.

419
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,926
The humans have probably
already sent slayers here to kill all of us.

420
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,568
Let them come.

421
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:00,269
- All they will find is death.
- We shall hear no more of this.

422
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,947
Dare not continue
with your treason, Von Griem.

423
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,640
Am I clear?

424
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,911
Of course.

425
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,679
Your will...

426
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:13,883
...is my pleasure.

427
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,554
My Lord.

428
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,092
Good.

429
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,600
- There's no time to gather the Council.
- Agreed.

430
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,636
- Eight assassins, kill them all.
- Immediately.

431
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,241
Bring me any artifacts
they manage to cobble together.

432
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,401
I'm on it.

433
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,576
Eliminate them all.

434
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:45,612
Von Griem.

435
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,802
I don't remember inviting you in.

436
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,974
Whoa.

437
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,612
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

438
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,020
Von Griem sent you?

439
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,886
Von Griem asked for a volunteer.

440
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,162
Then, I...

441
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,159
I simply couldn't resist.

442
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,002
Your visit is about as transparent
as that meeting tonight.

443
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,673
Von Griem has already begun...

444
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,781
...the resurrection
of the goddess, hasn't he?

445
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,511
You were always smartest of the bunch.

446
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,486
So you know why I'm here, huh?

447
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,287
The Council isn't about
to just hand over the talismans.

448
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,358
They don't have to.

449
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,652
Clever girl.

450
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,526
Fortunately for you
I am sympathetic to your cause.

451
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:38,726
So tell me.

452
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:40,698
Vlad.

453
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,899
Where...

454
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,039
...can I find them?

455
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,801
One, you already have.

456
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:48,803
Hey.

457
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,632
Might we have a word with you...

458
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,010
...friend?
- I'd rather not.

459
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,841
And the other?

460
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,480
Lord Rutherford
was in love with a mortal.

461
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,689
When she died,
he had it buried along with her.

462
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,091
Wow.

463
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,257
And a name?

464
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,991
Tell me a name.

465
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,333
Oldham.

466
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,566
Now. Tell me.

467
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,274
What did your master
instruct you to give me...

468
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,535
...in exchange for my cooperation?

469
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,586
Death.

470
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,100
Get the amulet.

471
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,437
I've got this.

472
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,453
Oh, please.

473
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,001
Hold him.

474
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,302
What is she doin'?

475
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:23,805
What are you doin'?

476
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,241
Bite down.

477
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,049
This is gonna hurt. But you'll heal.

478
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,198
- Please. Get me to a hospital.
- We can't. / She's right.

479
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,002
There's always questions.

480
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,973
Questions that we can't answer.

481
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,414
They'll be back.

482
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:15,947
And we'll be ready.

483
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:35,007
Why have so few
of our kind come to my aid?

484
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,613
We have had to work in secret.

485
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,850
The others do not support your return.

486
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:44,319
We are...

487
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,543
...outlaws.

488
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:49,022
Outlaws.

489
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,056
How can we be outlaws?

490
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:59,565
Those who cower in fear of lesser
beings and forces...

491
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,193
...should be the outlaws.

492
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:02,570
Mm.

493
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,266
The humans have grown in strength.

494
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,094
They hunt us down. We are...

495
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,606
...weak.

496
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:45,681
That's why we are meant
to eliminate the day.

497
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,517
When I am fully alive...

498
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,017
and my power restored
we will block out their sun.

499
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,516
You tell them.

500
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,519
Tell them I have returned.

501
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,592
All of them shall follow.

502
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,789
Or join the humans
as victims of my wrath.

503
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,733
Feeling better?

504
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,109
I'm sorry.

505
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,077
I didn't mean to stare.

506
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,685
Uh, I don't want you to think
I'm a pervert or anything.

507
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,355
Perversion has its place.

508
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,461
In the right context.

509
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,529
I'm gonna take a shower.

510
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,667
Then we can get started.

511
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:51,605
Thank you...

512
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,809
...for savin' my life.

513
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:56,467
No problem.

514
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,646
Here's hoping you're not gonna have
to return the favor.

515
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,549
The first thing you're gonna have to do
is control your transformatio...

516
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,223
which is gonna be difficult
for you considering...

517
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:09,689
...how weak you were last night.

518
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,416
Excuse me?

519
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,253
You heard me. Look.

520
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,058
Just 'cause we're in a similar situation,
it doesn't mean I have to like you.

521
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,362
You've been nothing
but a selfish jerk off to me...

522
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:21,094
...since the moment that we met.

523
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,572
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

524
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:24,799
And one more thing.

525
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,667
Any flirting that you think is
going on between us...

526
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,446
...that's just me being nice.

527
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,774
I wouldn't go for a scumbag
like you in a million years.

528
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,515
And when you stared at me
this morning...

529
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,416
...that made me sick.

530
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:47,660
That's good.

531
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:49,662
Frustration.

532
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,332
Aggression.

533
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,961
That's where it comes from.

534
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,034
Remember that feeling.

535
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,639
The adrenaline.

536
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,635
The increase in blood pressure.

537
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,609
It stimulates the retro virus
and forces it to become active.

538
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:05,642
With training, you're gonna be
able to control that.

539
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,516
You're gonna feel the changes
instead of the anger.

540
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,119
And then...

541
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:11,686
in time...

542
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,689
...you're gonna be able to do this.

543
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:19,762
Jesus.

544
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,330
See, I'm not angry.

545
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,832
I just learned how to control it.

546
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,636
How do I control it?

547
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,400
Relaxation.

548
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:33,833
Meditation.

549
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,744
Just clearing your head.

550
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,405
Again, in time
this is not gonna be a problem.

551
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,308
When the full moon comes
I get a little crazy, so...

552
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,680
pour a glass of wine,
I put a Sarah McMahan CD on...

553
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:45,753
...and I'm good to go.

554
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,718
Should I be taking notes here?

555
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,693
Sarah McMahan
and wine are just my thing.

556
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,726
- Everyone's different.
- Oh.

557
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:54,852
Hold on.

558
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,130
Hey Felix.

559
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,495
Look, I, uh, I'm not gonna be comin'
in to work today.

560
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,170
It's a long...

561
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,774
Hey. I just paid four hundred dollars
for that thing.

562
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,204
You need to focus.

563
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,637
You're on vacation.

564
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:12,138
Tell me something.
How old do you think I am?

565
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,246
Mid-twenties?

566
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,917
I was. Nine years ago.

567
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,288
Since then...

568
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:24,024
I've been shot at, stabbed, and hit
by a car goin' ninety miles an hour.

569
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:25,685
So it's true?

570
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,126
- We do live forever?
- Yes and no.

571
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:30,724
Some myths are true.

572
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:33,293
Silver bullets impede our ability to heal.

573
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,562
And then there's this plant.

574
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:35,970
Wolvesbayne.

575
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,029
It's like our kryptonite.

576
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:39,932
Why do you have it?

577
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,734
Because...

578
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,613
I've been working on an antidote.

579
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,775
If you're lucky, on contact,
that stuff will kill you.

580
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,513
What if it doesn't kill you?

581
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:57,888
Uh, how did you learn
how to do all this?

582
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,562
An old friend.

583
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:02,763
Where's he?

584
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,528
He's dead.

585
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,105
They killed him.

586
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,408
- The vampires.
- Yeah, uh, what's the deal with them?

587
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,804
I think that's enough
back story for today.

588
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:17,878
Before you leave here...

589
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,946
I wanna see you do the little stunt
that I just did.

590
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,644
- Yeah. For real?
- Mm-hmm.

591
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,115
All right.

592
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,489
I'll try.

593
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,090
No, you're not gonna try.
You're gonna do it.

594
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,589
Damn, you're bossy.

595
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:38,758
Okay. Come on, impress me.

596
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,169
All right.

597
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,512
I will not wait any longer.

598
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,885
Gather a company
and fetch me the human.

599
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,063
I want him tonight.

600
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,568
Yes, master.

601
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,580
Fascinating...

602
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,685
...isn't she?

603
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:33,517
She worries me, master.

604
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:36,816
How so?

605
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,189
You heard the Council.
They said she could not be trusted.

606
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,702
Because she cannot be controlled.

607
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,703
Their lust for power...

608
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,606
and control...

609
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,606
...clouds their objectivity.

610
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,408
But, if we do this...

611
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,581
...how do we know
she will not turn on us?

612
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:06,521
They have rumors that
she tried to enslave the entire planet.

613
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,422
Legends.

614
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,994
Stories to frighten vampires
before they go to sleep in the morning.

615
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,866
No more.

616
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:21,234
With her...

617
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,373
...we will be unstoppable.

618
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:49,665
It has begun.

619
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,176
What happened to him?

620
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,118
Well, he's just a little tired
from his first workout.

621
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:14,916
I fell off the ceiling.

622
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,089
Where's the amulet?

623
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,159
- What?
- Don't be stupid with us.

624
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,560
- I know you have it.
- We're running out of time.

625
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,327
I would love to help you if I knew
what the hell you were talkin' about.

626
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:26,798
He doesn't know.

627
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,770
Yeah. He doesn't know.

628
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,545
Your great grandfather, Eric Bayne,
was one of us.

629
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,012
Entrusted with one of the talismans
that the vampires now seek.

630
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down. Ho- uh.

631
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,152
My grandfather
and his best friend Lou Slawner...

632
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,221
...they, they own a bakery in Milwaukee.

633
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,552
After he retired...

634
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,553
...he fought the undead
for over forty years.

635
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,324
He wouldn't just misplace it.

636
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:55,764
So...

637
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,866
...think very hard, Russell.

638
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,597
Where is it?

639
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,610
The heirlooms.

640
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,249
My dad left me this old box.

641
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,682
It had, had a bunch of old papers
and land deeds...

642
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:18,648
...and assorted artifacts.

643
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:20,956
It's in there.

644
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,521
Where exactly is there?

645
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,454
The, uh, the Deltalands National Bank
in a safety deposit box.

646
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:29,560
Good.

647
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:30,992
It stays there.

648
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:32,532
Do you have an address?

649
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,894
The vampires are being
difficult as usual.

650
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,107
Most of the higher-ups
have fled the city. One remains.

651
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,463
Vlad Arau.

652
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,609
Who, who exactly are you guys?

653
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,841
Sadie MacPherson.
And this is Jacob Van Helsing.

654
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,405
Van Helsing.

655
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,046
I've heard that name before.

656
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,118
There are six amulets.

657
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,481
Magical talismans...

658
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,124
that were used to put her into a state...

659
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,556
...of suspended animation
four hundred years ago.

660
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,560
- Who is her?
- Lilith.

661
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,597
The first of their kind.
The vampire's Eve.

662
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,696
The most powerful of them all.

663
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:12,233
As vampirism spread, they began
to organize themselves into clans.

664
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,275
To protect and control the populations.

665
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,338
Lilith demanded
they pay homage to her.

666
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,644
She had aspirations of creating
a world of darkness.

667
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,512
Where humans were bred
like cattle for food.

668
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,522
That sounds like a good deal for them.
I mean, why would they want her gone?

669
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,088
'Cause not all vampires are bad.

670
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,064
Some just want their immortality.
To be left alone.

671
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,596
They saw her as a menace
to be destroyed.

672
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:41,796
They couldn't kill her outright.
She was too powerful.

673
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:43,828
Oh. So you guys...

674
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,036
...you're professional vampire hunters?

675
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,142
They hunt all creatures of the night.
Including us.

676
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,937
Only when we step out of line.

677
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:02,914
They need the six talismans to resurrect
their queen to its full power.

678
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,427
They believe this Vlad character
has one of them.

679
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:06,789
The other two are disappeared.

680
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,590
We know where one is.
So we're one step ahead.

681
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,667
Excuse me.

682
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,634
Can I talk to you for a second?

683
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,947
Russell.

684
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,345
Look.

685
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,846
- You're not ready to fight.
- Oh no. I can do this.

686
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,783
No. Today was good,
but you need a lot more practice.

687
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,923
Hey, I'm all about on the job training.
Come on. Let's, let's just do it.

688
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:36,615
Hey. These guys
are professional assassins.

689
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,522
There's only nine of them
in the world at a time...

690
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,889
because that's all that they need.

691
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,794
The entire vampire world,
scared to death of them.

692
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,729
- So, we're in good hands, right?
- No.

693
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,565
Look. They're ruthless.

694
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:52,171
They are fixated on their mission
and they are not going to protect us.

695
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,606
Look, I don't really have a choice,
all right?

696
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,404
The vampires are gonna come after me.

697
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,609
Just have my back.

698
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,788
Shall we?

699
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,228
- Hey, hey, what are you, what the hell?
- You're not ready.

700
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:21,796
Wha- you just said...

701
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,227
Guess I lied.

702
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:25,639
Hey...

703
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,140
Hey...

704
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:30,746
Sorry, mate.

705
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:35,105
Come on.

706
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,461
Hello.

707
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,727
You should have come with us
the other night.

708
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,295
You would have had such a good time.

709
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,437
All bark, no bite.

710
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,039
Don't worry.

711
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,549
A day late and a dollar short.

712
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:35,609
No.

713
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,079
Hey, toots.

714
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,919
You're connected to two blood IVs.

715
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,124
One is clean blood.

716
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,455
The other is hers.

717
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,167
She is an immune.

718
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,605
Her blood is poison to your system.

719
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,468
You tell me what I need to know
and I'll be merciful.

720
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,475
I'll allow you to regenerate,
and after all this is over...

721
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:11,645
...I'll set you free.

722
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,250
So predictable.

723
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,824
Enjoy.

724
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,641
Can't watch this.

725
01:04:43,879 --> 01:04:45,540
The poison is slow acting.

726
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,442
The pain will go on for minutes.

727
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,243
Days. Weeks. Months if I choose

728
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,445
Or, you can cooperate.

729
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:57,749
And tell me what I want to know.

730
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,593
I will tell you nothing.

731
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,961
Look around.

732
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,938
The goddess grows in power.

733
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:18,412
The sun will not rise tomorrow.

734
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,576
Because she commands it.

735
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:27,113
We will rise in power...

736
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:32,484
and you will live as our slaves.

737
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:42,000
Tell me what I need to know...

738
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,697
and then I'll be merciful
and let you live.

739
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,266
Then we'll send your goddess back
to where she belongs.

740
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,069
'Cause no one's enslaving anyone.

741
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:52,746
Not on my watch.

742
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,614
- These guys are no joke, huh?
- No, they're not.

743
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,693
Sometimes I think they actually
enjoy their job.

744
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,254
The other day...

745
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,655
I didn't tell you the entire truth.

746
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,030
About the man who taught me
everything I knew.

747
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,299
His name was Templeton.

748
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,439
I was young.

749
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,210
We fell in love.

750
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,745
He was a slave for the vampires.

751
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:31,242
Countess Bathorly was his mistress.

752
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:35,116
When she died...

753
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,754
...he was set free.

754
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,927
So he went to work
for the vampire hunters.

755
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:46,926
There was a war...

756
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,700
...between the vampires
and the humans.

757
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,032
They found a way to control him.

758
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,079
Hunters killed him in his sleep.

759
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,310
And that's why I don't trust them.

760
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,984
Sounds like they might
not have had a choice.

761
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,088
We all have choices.

762
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:14,062
The paths that we walk,
they're ours, and ours alone.

763
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,193
Is there any way for them
to do this to us?

764
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,591
To turn us against the hunters?

765
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:20,899
Or each other?

766
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:30,740
Give me a name.

767
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,205
A name.

768
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,374
Oldham.

769
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:36,876
Oldham.

770
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:45,817
What's the name again?

771
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,293
Oldham.

772
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,586
They captured and tortured me.

773
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,549
I waited as long as I could.

774
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,326
But they were gonna kill me.

775
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:29,965
I told them where to find it.

776
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,668
What was I supposed to do?

777
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,444
Die?

778
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,607
It's here.

779
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:42,676
We'll cover you.

780
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,754
Jacob Van Helsing.

781
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,500
I should thank you for saving me
some valuable time.

782
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,900
- It's not here.
- She's right, you know.

783
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,164
I promise you.

784
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,199
Your deaths shall be swift.

785
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,143
You're nothing if not a...

786
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,640
...worthy adversary.

787
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,609
Let's not get ahead of ourselves,
shall we?

788
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,046
Give to me what is mine.

789
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:25,845
Sure you want it?

790
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,920
Then I think we should give it to them.

791
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,684
Right.

792
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,889
You are immune but not immortal.

793
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,898
Silver bullets, bitch.

794
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,378
Bring me the final talisman
or the others will die.

795
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,846
Their blood shall be on your hands.

796
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:11,826
Jacob.

797
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:13,727
They took her.

798
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,056
Now would be a good time
to call your backup.

799
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,112
I always wanted a pet.

800
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:40,687
You need to be good
or you're not gonna have any treats.

801
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:49,128
You're quite amusing.
I think I'll kill you last.

802
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,789
Your killing days are over.

803
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,729
Soon you will be one of us.

804
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,894
You're almost as funny
as your girlfriend.

805
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:03,603
You will not be immune
to the bite of the goddess.

806
01:13:03,745 --> 01:13:05,542
Something to look forward to.

807
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,779
I was hoping to just
shoot you in the face...

808
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,884
...with a forty-five
and stake you to the ground.

809
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,646
I will not allow that.

810
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:16,685
You're going to stop me?

811
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,093
No, my little one.

812
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:23,594
You will call me master,
you will do my bidding.

813
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,324
Only if your bidding includes
killing you and all your friends.

814
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,701
I think not.

815
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:32,768
But you and I are going
to have some issues, love.

816
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,205
You...

817
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:48,621
...will soon see the wisdom
of our ways.

818
01:13:58,834 --> 01:13:59,732
How do we know where they are?

819
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,495
One of my cohorts pressured
the Vampire Council...

820
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,967
...into telling them where they are.

821
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:04,606
That'd be him.

822
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,913
Downtown.
The River Run Movie Theater.

823
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,177
Closed down
in nineteen seventy-seven.

824
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,283
Last thing they showed there
was Star Wars.

825
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,286
Ever since then it's been
a bloodsucker hangout.

826
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:24,689
Russell. I'd like you to meet Jimmy
the Kid.

827
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,553
- We call him The Kid.
- Come on man, we talked about this.

828
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,592
It's not The Kid.

829
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:30,465
It's Jimmy.

830
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:31,764
It's Jimmy.

831
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,398
- Let me guess. You're the werewolf?
- That's right.

832
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,401
Do me a favor buddy.
Keep your distance.

833
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,972
I got one eye on them,
and one eye on you.

834
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,409
But I got silver bullets too. -

835
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,211
With your name on 'em, pal.

836
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:46,806
- Whoo. Come on.
- Ignore whatever he says.

837
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,877
- We usually do.
- Who's The Kid?

838
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,647
Let's go. I'm drivin'.

839
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,822
Von Griem tells me
that you were captured.

840
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:33,625
- And tortured.
- Yes.

841
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,164
I had no choice but to tell them.

842
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:38,593
But I told Von Griem immediately
where to find them.

843
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,664
I see.

844
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:41,701
Yet, you...

845
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,037
jeopardized...

846
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:44,694
everything...

847
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,408
...because of your weakness.

848
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,739
- I did...
- The type of weakness...

849
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,647
...that will not be tolerated
in the new world.

850
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,518
- In my world.
- Yes, your highness.

851
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,227
Is it better to...

852
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,957
try to teach her...

853
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,730
...or to try to use her as an example?
- Your Highness, may I suggest...

854
01:16:14,936 --> 01:16:16,096
How dare you?

855
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,970
Your Highness.
She was a member of my clan.

856
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,599
Your clan? Your clan no longer exists.

857
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,878
All of you shall follow me.

858
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,915
I will lead us in this new millennium
of darkness.

859
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,484
I am their leader as I am yours.
Do not dare...

860
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,515
...challenge my decisions.

861
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,217
Child of the night.

862
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:16,995
We're not so different. Yeah.

863
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,883
Bring me the other one.

864
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:52,597
Are you ready my child?
Ready to become my servant?

865
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:54,563
Ready...

866
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,565
...and willing.

867
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,279
Von Griem.

868
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,440
Van Helsing.

869
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,041
Release them.

870
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,508
And I will give you this.

871
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,525
You are in a position
to ask for nothing.

872
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:22,654
Kill him.

873
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:24,654
Bring me the amulet.

874
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:42,974
Shall we give it a go?

875
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,861
Try not to get too excited.
The stake's in my back pocket.

876
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,275
What have you got now, Van Helsing?

877
01:19:51,717 --> 01:20:50,275
