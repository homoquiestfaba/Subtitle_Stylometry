the history, he/she had already told it to you

6
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,426
 TO this I am devoted 

7
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,417
 Hello 

8
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,074
Hello, I am Jeffrey Good

00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:51,255
Ok, I have the 10 commandments there

10
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,798
And I will give them 10 histories

11
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:56,103
Each one according to the commandments

12
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,701
So hands to the work

13
00:01:58,988 --> 00:01:59,936
Pardon to arrive late

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,794
By the way, a short history, my wife... 

15
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:05,887
 ... no, I won't tell them this

16
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:09,961
Ok, a long-short history
my wife and I have been bad

17
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,249
We agreed in
to go after the... 

18
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,139
 ... and to have a great day
of purchases

19
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,860
Not I will count them

20
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,137
He/she will put on of bad and... 

21
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,376

22
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,407
 ... they didn't come... 

23
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:26,193
 ... to listen my shits, certain?

24
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:29,938
I came to give them 10 histories
and arrive late, so... 

25
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:32,547
 ... for that don't already make it

26
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:34,077
That the party begins

27
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,440
History not. 1

28
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,060
NOT YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER GOD
MA THAT ME

29
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,627
REVISE THE PARACHUTE
BEFORE OF JUMPING

30
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,059
This ignition? Hello to all
I will jump

31
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,237
These nervous one?

32
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:59,065
No, like I will be nervous
I will marry

33
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,046
- Bring it
- These nervous one

34
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:04,648
Look that high we are

35
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:08,090
It is like in the movie Titanic

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,334
I want them to throw me
as to their friends

37
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,190
you already know it

38
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:18,728
Ok, let us make it that the party begins

39
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,626
Excuse... 

40
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,009
-  ...  he/she forgot their parachute
- Please tell me that it is joke

41
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,677
No, it is not joke

42
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:31,529
Oh not, Steven!

43
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,149
Steven oh my God

44
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:37,660
Are you well?

45
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,196
No, really not

46
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:50,656
It seems to be well, but... 

47
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:55,050
 ... their body this so buried one
that it cannot take off

48
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:57,418
That would kill him

49
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:59,118
That it is supposed that he/she makes?

50
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,102
Alone to leave to my engaged one
there buried?

51
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,216
If

52
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:07,866
But I suggest that both
return to their normal routine

53
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:13,223
Don't sunbathe

54
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,645
Do You Know Restaurant Fun?

55
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,875
There is a show tomorrow

56
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:23,435
We would rot... 

57
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:24,672
forget it

58
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,312
Pardon that you said?

59
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,944
- Anything, did I say as these baby?
- Horrible

60
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,701
Ok, we are to the air in 30 seconds

61
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,122
We will marry in the house
of the beach of my parents and.

62
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:44,692
If very beautiful

63
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:47,170
But now it seems that it will be here

64
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,224
If, it will be... 

65
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:51,248
 ... he/she already knows, there

66
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:53,728
 ... and it will be... 

67
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,534
No, this well

68
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:08,004
Ok, 5, 4, 3, 2... 

69
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,273
Thank you Jake, I am here in
a field away from Homesdale

70
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:17,634
Where Steve has been buried
in the earth the last two months

71
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:21,324
I suppose that you know
that you are hero's spice

72
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,789
You have some words for
your growing fans group?

73
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,634
No, really not

74
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:31,787
He/she is a man of few words

75
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,624
But many followers

76
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,815
They gather by day or at night
to have something of the one

77
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:40,181
The buried Hero

78
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:44,066
This Halloween will be a little
but...  under earth

79
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,100
I Am Steven Montgomery,
if they remove me I die

80
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,570
The Fever has begun Montgomery

81
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,704
we will make the unemployed that that
Steven Montgomery to their body

82
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:59,880
We will be buried low earth
and we will make sure that they don't move us

83
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,317
I will be direct because
it is my style

84
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,296
Not you are amusing

85
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:09,605
With that act, never
you achieved something in this city

86
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,094
- As they allow to enter to people as her?
- I suppose that taenia mentions

87
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,920
- Not another time passed
- But it is worth

88
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,205
Sr. it is Sr Montgomery
in the line 1

89
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,288
Steven... 

90
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:28,295
 ... they come and we will make a history
in the TV, what do you say?

91
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,341
Do you never play?

92
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,165
He/she would make it but if I make it as the other ones
as you would know that I am?

93
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:44,171
- Where this Steven?
- Here, as always

94
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,190
Hello, Steven

95
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:49,789
I have two tickets for
the world series, do you want to go?

96
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:52,268
No, in fact not

97
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,980
- For that not?
- Because I cannot move, Fred

98
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,919
If he/she made it, he/she would die

99
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,688
We all die to know
will your character leave at some time?

100
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,906
Not I mean a lot... 

101
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:25,169
But I will say this

102
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,860
Probably not, for obvious reasons

103
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:37,899
I would have been embarrassed for two years

104
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,827
As agent of Montgomery
all world calls me

105
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:45,240
The world has changed

106
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,173
Without moving

107
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,135
When I began in this industry... 

108
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,632
it is like a Trail Blazer... 

109
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,792
I believe that it is very safe
to be in the hat of Brando

110
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:02,616
America loves my things... 

111
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,325
Steven Montgomery, hero, superestrella... 

112
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:07,012
 ... God

113
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,818
There was a tragedy in Texas when a group
of adolescents I jump intentionally of an airplane

114
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,172
Without parachute

115
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:18,144
Obviously to imitate a man
that they come as a God

116
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:19,864
Steven Montgomery

117
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:23,234
Turn off that shit

118
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,215
What this happening here?

119
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,257
Who these people are?

120
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,211
- Not it is what you believe
- Not it is what you believe

121
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,641
Kelly, waits

122
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:33,341
He/she waits

123
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,164
Not I can move

124
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:36,795
Damned it is I cannot move

125
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:55,597
Not wise to where to go

126
00:08:57,672 --> 00:08:58,824
This well, listen to me

127
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:01,279
I will take care now of you

128
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:02,594
Will you make it?

129
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:03,893
Clear

130
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,746
Ok, to the air in 5, 4, 3,

131
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:25,696
That he/she has the monkey in common
with Feed Newton, anything

132
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:29,841
Think again, both sometimes
they are brown

133
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:34,615
Steven, I have bad news
your program has been canceled

134
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:38,677
The girl that was here
taenia 16 and something happened

135
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,258
I thought that taenia 18

136
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:42,519
Not it cares, it was here

137
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,128
- I thought that her already wise
- Not Steve cares... 

138
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:49,181
-  ...  you had sex with her
- I thought that it was she "dedeando!"

139
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,670
is the same thing, don't you understand it Steven?

140
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,336
Shit, give me another work

141
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:56,922
Not I have anything Steven

142
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:01,927
Let us face it, you cannot leave
without dying

143
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:04,323
I don't make the rules

144
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:08,307
It is like the market is managed
I have to take this... 

145
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,543
Hello, Johnny Franco

146
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,396
I am blocked here
that it happens?

147
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,948
He/she looks, you have to decide
quick, because... 

148
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,621
At the end of the day, there won't be but... 

149
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,559
Three years later

150
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,734
What did it pass Steven Montgomery?

151
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,944
In the last three years that
Steve has been outside of the air

152
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,074
He/she chose a calm life

153
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,606
Blocked in the earth

154
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:41,991
Always

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,203
Before it pleased me

156
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:45,919
Now I hate it

157
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:48,865
Thank you Lewis

158
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,260
They are all the news for
tonight, I am Brein Vincent

159
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,043
And me James Stanfold, good night

160
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:01,869
Do they come like it works?

161
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,021
It was the first and
I have nine but

162
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:05,523
In total they will be 10

163
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:06,755
And they know what is 10

164
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:09,863
10 are...  does somebody know?

165
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,692
It is as if we didn't have but

166
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,497
Good, we go to the
second history

167
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,679
Do we go?

168
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,766
No, don't help me in anything

169
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,539
Not he/she knew that you were here

170
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,392
Undoubtedly not wise, not you
nobody cares but that your same one

171
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,231
- Gretchen
- Don't tempt me today, you will lose

172
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,528
Do they come that? Am I crazy?
Not wise that was here

173
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:35,878
God, goes to the point, there is not
something that could... 

174
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:39,949
 ... before never we fought
before we laughed at those people

175
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,638
If it broke that knot
I would laugh so much

176
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,613
They knew that laughing
is the best medicine?

177
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:48,155
No, he/she would not need medicine
to break it

178
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,667
It is this way like he/she was laughing

179
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:57,333
It was so much time ago I laughed
so much that he/she already forgets like it is

180
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,475
I sit down it, I didn't want to bore them
with this... 

181
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,310
 ... oxydon 3

182
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,249
It is this way like he/she called himself that oil

183
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,920
Good, let us return to
our 10 histories

184
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,571
We Go with the No. 2

185
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:12,398
The duck, the news

186
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,541
NOT YOU SWORE IN THE NAME OF GOD
IN VAIN

187
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,731
Improving your Spanish?

188
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,564
If, a moment

189
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,511
Very well

190
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,040
You hear yourself as my grandma

191
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,094
That not so good fué

192
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,951
As it is, I want that

00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:23,059
It will be in Mexico this summer

194
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,200
Very well Oliver

195
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,894
I will be able to improve my pronunciation

196
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Mexico

197
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,353
Do you see what we have Gloria?

198
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,671
For that don't leave with me?

199
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,961
God willing it felt this way, but not

200
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,785
Not you can be my girlfriend

201
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,010
Every day, during
five years

202
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:44,096
I introduce you to Tony,
your temporary substitution

203
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,446
As these?

204
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,027
He/she had not seen you

205
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:52,622
- Hello, pardon, this better one?
- A lot

206
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,842
The system this here

207
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:59,504
I wrote you here the instructions
and if you need something

208
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,464
- you can call me... 
- Hey relaxes you

209
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:03,081
He/she takes your vacations

210
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:04,752
Drive crazy you, have a good time

211
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:07,044
Tony can get ready them
certain Tony?

212
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:15,193
Perhaps be right

213
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,140
- I want... 
- If

214
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,795
I want... 

215
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:13,951
 ... to catch your teats, if!

216
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:17,227
No, I don't believe that it is
that what you try to say

217
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,250
A moment

218
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,056
Prove this...  it is very sweet

219
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,347
"Thank you" Alfonso, but... 

220
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:46,316
 ... "tired" by my airplane

221
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,082
He is Jesús

222
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,259
I like in knowing you

223
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:48,588
 ... our gentleman and savior
Jesus Christ

224
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:53,755
Oh Oliver, if, Oliver

225
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:55,992
Oh Jesús

226
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,171
Who demons are Jesús

227
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,102
Nobody, Oliver

228
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:04,526
- These exaggerating
- Exaggerating?

229
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:08,527
That it would seem you that
Patricia told you to half... 

230
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:25,166
9 ...  10

231
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,205
Lament this

232
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:34,680
From when you exercise?

233
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,630
That you speak?
I found it below

234
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:38,348
I thought of giving him/her a little
of flavor to my pectoral

235
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,850
- Flavor to your pectoral?
- That? Flavor to my pectoral

236
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,218
Not you

237
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,610
There is something that I don't like

238
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,123
That you think Rachel?
That I deceive you?

239
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:51,136
Allow me to guess, I knew to
a girl in the coffee

240
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,692
It is as if you take something hot
with a glove you didn't burn

241
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:58,661
- Twice?
- Not he/she will say that

242
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:02,114
- Then I can... 
- Please, continuous

243
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:06,035
They saw, boys

244
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,429
It questions my pectoral

245
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,473
I sit down it it was not my intention... 

246
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,294
Ah if, here the third history goes

247
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,197
NOT YOU KILLED

248
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:31,642
Scalpel

249
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:35,909
Forceps

250
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:43,886
This well?

251
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,319
- Scissors
- scissors

252
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,388
- It is everything
- Good work, Dr Richie

253
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:57,038
Thank You Mattie

254
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:11,211
- Every time that I move.
- Hey seems that we have a couple... 

255
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,256
Dr. she has a horrible pain
from the operation

256
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:16,979
Oh if

257
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,605
Do you see this? Not it should be there

258
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:28,937
This cutting the knives

259
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:31,145
The scissors prescribe

260
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:33,766
They are causing most
of the pain

261
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:36,459
I leave the scissors inside
of my wife?

262
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:41,130
- If, it is this way
- How could it make this way an error?

263
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,325
Not fué error, I made it as joke

264
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,830
- Does he/she joke?
- No, relax you

265
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:51,449
- As joke, I made it as joke
- Not I understand

266
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:54,517
Clearly he/she doesn't know me,
I joke a lot

267
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:56,992
My friends know it

268
00:25:57,197 --> 00:26:01,767
If, I joke, the thing is
that he/she has to understand my sense of humor

269
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,784
I believe that it is everything, Natty

270
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:07,799
Your you were when it operates her
throw the scissors in their belly

271
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,251
For that made it?

272
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,178
if I remember well, he/she made it
as joke

273
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:16,706
- Now you do go?
- Dog son, serve looks at that of the... !

274
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:18,191
 ... stomach of my wife, now!

275
00:26:21,796 --> 00:26:23,232
Baby

276
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,027
- This dead one
- What?

277
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:27,323
Do wait, is a joke?

278
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,245
It is a...  no, this dead one

279
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:31,929
He/she still wants him to remove him/her
the scissors, seemingly not

280
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:36,019
- He/she murdered my wife
- Hey, fué a joke

281
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:38,590
As joke, does he/she know that?

282
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,918
It is very violent, I have
that to fly

283
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:48,357
Let us be direct

284
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,903
He/she says that you accent a
I orchestrate surgical in their body... 

285
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,963
 ... knowing it and deliberately

286
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,089
I have been a good surgeon
during 20 years

287
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:04,664
Good citizen, a father,
family man...  a husband

288
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:12,565
It put those deliberately
scissors in their body?

289
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:17,803
He/she would never make something that hurt to
some patient, fué a joke

290
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:20,407
- Did it put the scissors?
- They belonged to practitioners

291
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:23,503
- Did it put the scissors?
- During the last 20 years

292
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,305
Did it put the scissors?

293
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:28,334
- Did it put the scissors?
- As a prostitute joke

294
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:38,442
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury

295
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:40,857
I would like a joke

296
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:43,475
As much as to this type

297
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,556
In the school, me and my
roommate

298
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:52,335
We put to an oriental inside
of the cajuela of my corvette

299
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:54,578
It is a joke

300
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:58,267
But it is a joke... 

301
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,961
 ... and later fué murder

302
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:04,192
- Objection
- Accepted

303
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:05,435
Refused

304
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:08,634
Alone I joke

305
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:12,251
It is one of the many examples

306
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:16,747
I already heard too much, I am here
to close up of for life

307
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:18,867
For the murder of Sheyla Contiella

308
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:23,048
Their lordship

309
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:25,900
- Will we have the same thing?
- Clear

310
00:28:26,124 --> 00:28:27,712
does he/she want to go by everything?

311
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:29,672
As he/she wants

312
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,294
- They arrived to a verdict
- It is this way, their lordship

313
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:46,558
Us the jury, we find
to the protected one... 

314
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,609
 ... guilty

315
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:50,238
Murder in first grade

316
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:55,781
Not to say this, but
what I said 3 hours ago was not?

317
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:59,945
- But they insisted in... 
- But their lordship, the system works this way

318
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:02,768
Is it as well as does the system work?

319
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:09,084
Please, say but to the world
we want to know it

320
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:12,009
The Verdict is, as there was him
said before

321
00:29:12,277 --> 00:29:14,977
Life imprisonment, for
Dr. Richie

322
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:17,292
Is a joke?

323
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:18,565
I don't believe it

324
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:22,287
If it was for my, it would send it to the death

325
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:24,720
Damned imbiles

326
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,506
- Thank you their lordship
- Ah, your... 

327
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,028
- Your in contempt
- Me?

328
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:34,596
For that? That I will make?

329
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,670
I knew that there are vacancies in
the plant

330
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,162
He/she can that it is better than this

331
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:43,066
You were very good in this

332
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:44,601

333
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,989

00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:34,669
But it is worth you that you are quiet the muzzle
and begin to suck me the verga

336
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:38,510
I joke

337
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,387
Very good

338
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,042

341
00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:00,462
Oh if, this playing basketbol

It will be outside hours

343
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:05,586
- Oh not you... 
- Which the alternative is?

344
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,768
It ruined your glorious day

345
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:12,575
I want to make you love
before your session

346
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:14,379
It is terrible about the love
of the women

347

I believe that we would should
to see the points

348

Don't misinterpret me, I offer you
a same salary

349
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:21,741
But there are some differences

350

You want to be in the front line
I don't believe it

351
00:31:24,057 --> 00:31:27,151
The Russian will come and
they will want to be in your boobies

352
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:30,777
You are so sexy when

I will make it this week

357
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,102
This is the following history

358
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,649
It becomes touching

359
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:54,864
Can you feel?

360
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:01,825
You HONORED Your Father and Mother

361
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:06,650
20 years ago

362
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,889
- Is he/she a boy or girl?
- I will say this way it, the first are boy... 

363
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:21,084
 ... here the boy Not comes. 2

364
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,135
Oh my God

365
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,803
Is there ace in that vagina?

366
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:31,044
I love it

367
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,418
My small ones

368
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:41,016
I will love them until I die

369
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,797
We have already grown

370
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:01,328
I believe that it is moment
of telling us the truth

371
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,606
About that?

372
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:05,914
about the fact that
your and dad are white

373
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:07,517
and we are black

374
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:10,506
certain

375
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,758
Wise that this day he/she would come

376
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:15,621
The year before they were born

377
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:19,085
He/she was the reporter for
the local newspaper

378
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:23,632
And I had to opportunity of interviewing
to all the big stars

379
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:25,641
Denzel Washington

380
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:27,772
Morgan Freeman

381
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,118
 ... to all

382
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:33,569
And although it was married with
their father

383
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:36,319
And it was very in love of the one

384
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,239
From time to time

385
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,167
After the interviews

386
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,683
These stars

387
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:44,783
They caught me

388
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,684
Mom, leave you of things
did you have sex with them or not?

389
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:52,520
- As I said... 
- Who is our biological father?

390
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:56,505
One night after one
he/she interviews... 

391
00:33:56,505 --> 00:33:59,398
 ... take the opportunity of... 

392
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,564
 ... to catch with Arnold Zuartzeneger

393
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:03,442
and... 

394
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,126
They need that I spelled them to him

395
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:05,911
if

396
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:09,545
I...  F... 

397
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,400
Or...  Z...  K... 

398
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:17,745
 ... Or...  D... 

399
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:20,140
To...  R...  N... 

400
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:21,760
Or...  L...  D

401
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,848
S...  Z... 

402
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,436
-  ...  And... 
- Mom - you Allow it to finish

403
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:34,138
 ... W...  To...  R...  And...  N

404
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:37,120
And...  G...  G... 

405
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,675
 ... And...  R

406
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:44,031
You Say that Arnold Zwarszenegger
is our biological father?

407
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:47,053
If, for that reason they are so high

408
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:50,429
He/she always told to all
that they were high because they ate a lot

409
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:53,243
- As you can be sure... ?
- Positive

410
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,438
It was with the only one with the one
that I was in that moment

411
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,799
And I made myself a test of blood
to prove it

412
00:34:58,048 --> 00:34:59,646
How you explain the color
dark of the skin?

413
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:03,181
Him you, believe me, him you

414
00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:13,403
About that conversation
I have been thinking a lot

415
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:15,782
and I have decided

416
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:18,390
it is better for you
that they know their true father

417
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:20,010
Really?

418
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,692
If...  so... 

419
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:24,810
Without but that to say

420
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:28,574
He/she has returned, and here it is

421
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:31,952
The man, schemes it

422
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:33,781
Their father

423
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,992
The incomparable one, Arnold Zswarzenegger

424
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,069
Hello children

425
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,448
I Am Arnold

426
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:45,875
Finally I know my
two children

427
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:48,364
It will be fantastic

428
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:51,727
Do they want to go to the bar or something like that?

429
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:53,645
he/she suckles

430
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:55,851
He is not Arnold zwarzenegger

431
00:35:57,644 --> 00:36:01,018
- Could you wait in the room?
- Clear

432
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:02,941
egresare

433
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:09,113
Look, I tried to arrive to Arnold
but now he/she is a politician

434
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:11,317
and I could not pass the reception

435
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:13,359
that type is it covers its events

436
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,130
Alone he/she wanted to give them an idea
of like it was

437
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:18,934
this well suckles

438
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:20,345
thank you

439
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,145
We will try him to work

440
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,427
Those are my beautiful boys

441
00:36:25,872 --> 00:36:26,677
Return

442
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:31,496
Dad

443
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:33,427
son

444
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:55,920
You that this owes
to be difficult for you

445
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,750
so many levels

446
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:01,698
1. their father has died

447
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:06,586
He/she makes but of one week
it would not have imagined this

448
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:09,430
after canceling
a great battle

449
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:18,029
2. that their biological father is not nobody
but that the international star and governor

450
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:19,578
they already know who is

451
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,176
Arnold Zwarzenegger

452
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:24,047
To have me to my, replacing it to the one

453
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:32,852
and to make them feel comfortable

454
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:33,941
comfortable

455
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:37,972
and complete

456
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:46,796
To know that they have two biological parents
and to be African-American American

457
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:50,309
it should be difficult

458
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:51,867
not so much

459
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:55,746
you don't have to fake the voice
of Arnold if you don't want

460
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:01,871
look, to be honest with you

461
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:06,150
it is sometimes but fcil to express
my true feelings

462
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,088
making this personification

463
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,467
there are things that he/she can say
but that Mark Jakempson

464
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,082
many

465
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:21,702
We go

466
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:42,749
Look at my so sweated children

467
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,154
he/she suckles, true Arnold szwaurzenegger
it is as this

468
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,253
I have not spoken with the one
in years

469
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,483
according to memory

470
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,994
Oh my God

471
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:54,649
Van to hate me for this reason

472
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,230
I made some... 

473
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,592
Not it was Arnold Szwarzenegger

474
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:04,859
It was... 

475
00:39:07,856 --> 00:39:09,329
That explains a lot

476
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:11,234
Then discover the true truth

477
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,150
And the test of blood that you said?

478
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,278
It was for the... 

479
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:19,010
And like I am?

480
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,255
What can we make?

481
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:23,171
No

482
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:28,554
I can make a good Eddie Murphy

483
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:30,447
- This well
- Same difference

484
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:43,560
Do they remember?

485
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,824
They can think that our
family is a little different

486
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:50,354
But do they know that?

487
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,156
It is our familla
and it is what counts

488
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:55,910
Who goes to say who
he/she is your father

489
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,659
Is he/she the person that and did it raise?

490
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,607
Or he/she is the person that gave you their DNA

491
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,574
Or perhaps it is a type that
this in your house imitating comedians

492
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:07,382
That it is the same one that
your biological father

493
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,247
If they ask us?
It is the I finish

494
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:14,063
The type that this at home
imitating a famous comedian

495
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,136
that it also raised
to famous other comedian

496
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,074
who is your biological father

497
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:20,436
- I Am Gratt Jeffey
- and me Ted Jeffey

498
00:40:20,436 --> 00:40:22,971
And we are the Siblings Jeffey

499
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,292
Gretchen is an incredible wife but

500
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:41,613
Liz makes me feel young and I live

501
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:45,891
and the sex, hey the sex

502
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,894
If, but it is worthwhile to throw 20 years
of marriage for a moment?

503
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:56,869
- The monogamy is... 
- what maintains the society in foot

504
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:01,039
 ... biochemistry...  to deploy
our... 

505
00:41:01,278 --> 00:41:02,876
.. as soon as you burn the truth
you will be but happy

506
00:41:03,118 --> 00:41:04,840
I am happy with this

507
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,406
- Not him these
- I am really it

508
00:41:07,622 --> 00:41:11,357
They were 24 good hours but
it is with who I sleep

509
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,249
If he/she had my milk free
you could be so sure

510
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,859
He/she would begin to catch cows

511
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:20,285
It is easy to say it for you
I have children

512
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:23,079
It is the only reason to continue this way
when I wake up

513
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,549
You live in a world of fantasy

514
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,996
Perhaps but I take
a pill

515
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:28,167
to feel well

516
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:29,865
Not you to the one who to believe

517
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:31,735
Ave or Scottie

518
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,859
What is been... 

519
00:41:36,153 --> 00:41:39,350
 ... we have 10 histories
and I won't disappoint you

520
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:41,130
I promise them to him

521
00:41:43,828 --> 00:41:46,949
NOT YOU COVETED

522
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,876
Does one scheme as of hospital?
for that would make that?

523
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,257
it is ridiculous

524
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,085
The problem of being a hero

525
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:40,649
do you know that?

526
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,442
we will have one it schemes this way

527
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:48,136
Affection would not know that
to make on one schemes this way

528
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:51,550
I will investigate it, if I can with
the Video casetera can with this

529
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:53,265
I configure VCR

530
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:55,030
- Hey
- Not it was intentional

531
00:42:56,395 --> 00:42:57,464
I sit down it Jake

532
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,125
do you know that dad loves you certain?

533
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:02,253
- Pope loves you
- I configure VCR

534
00:43:02,973 --> 00:43:04,197
- Ray!
- Not it was intentional

535
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:06,025
I sit down it Jake

536
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,715
do you know that potato loves you, certain?

537
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:10,214

MARS

541
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:28,490
Oh sits down it

00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,868

547
00:44:08,643 --> 00:44:09,241

00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:48,734

552
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,539

553
00:46:07,817 --> 00:46:09,418
McDonalds

554
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:11,779
Burger King

555
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,586
I love them, some changes
and they are but famous

556
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:19,754
It is this way

557
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,639
I really love Ray

558
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:26,310
thank you

559
00:46:30,138 --> 00:46:35,027
This is the radioactive nucleus
of where the energy comes

560
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:37,848
so that you connect
their you scheme electric

561
00:46:38,064 --> 00:46:39,654
Doesn't it become very hot there?

562
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,760
Don't worry, we are
perfectly safe here

563
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,180
We know that we make

564
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:46,904
Attention, this it is not a mockery

565
00:46:47,173 --> 00:46:49,632
This is not a mockery,
all the levels... 

566
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:53,861
This happening!

567
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:01,187
There are many children that can be
exposed at dangerous levels of radiation!

568
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,154
That demons will make?

569
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:06,088
The substitution will be able to fix everything
in the following hour

570
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:10,848
Impossible, where we go to
does to find scheme this way in this city?

571
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:13,869
- I have an idea
- That it happens we already have many problems

572
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:18,776
In a reality show... 

573
00:47:18,997 --> 00:47:22,255
- That that is?
- It is a panel of celebrities

574
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:23,787
Not you!

575
00:47:25,987 --> 00:47:31,028
- I was hardly happened
- we will speak later when we concentrate

576
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:36,574
Your dad doesn't maybe have a
heap of you scheme this way?

577
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:57,756
Not there is here neither nobody

578
00:47:58,061 --> 00:47:59,185
I don't have my key

579
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,974
It is an entire relief the one
to leave the house

580
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:50,431
Your you said it

581
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:29,529

we go, don't die
not now

586
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:50,342
In the news, 75 children
they are dying

587
00:49:50,544 --> 00:49:53,698
as a result of an accident
in a nuclear plant

588
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:58,349
The hopes finished the one
not to be able to enter to those houses

589
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:02,040
It is reported that they had dozens
of you scheme that they would save their lives

590
00:50:02,305 --> 00:50:07,313
Collected without reason by two neighbors
that unaccountably they have not been opposing

591
00:50:07,528 --> 00:50:12,622
Formally this being pursued
the one in charge of the nuclear plant

592
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,387
The details to the moment

593
00:50:20,122 --> 00:50:21,294
the bill

594
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,606
Have you been deceiving me one year ago?

595
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,655
He/she finished, long!

596
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:31,202
I am fed up with your lies
of your excuses and your... 

597
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,375
 ... lousy stone chart

598
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,678
To where it is supposed that he/she goes?

599
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:37,286
For my it vetoes to the hell

600
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:39,205
Veto with your small prostitute

601
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:40,417
Not he/she is a prostitute

602
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:42,454
he/she is an actress and you know it

603
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:45,880
one is also considered
magician

604
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:47,803
You know that that your you cannot make... 

605
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:49,793
Not say anything of that that
you can be sorry

606
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:53,921
- Don't say it, I notice it to you!
- Veto to fly, Gretchen

607
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:57,739
Veto to fly

608
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:02,831
Prostitute's son!

609
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,312
 Ok, something that to speak... </i>

610
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:16,687
NOT you WANTED THE Woman
DE YOUR NEIGHBOR

611
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:46,596
They have not shown up
they have just transferred me

612
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:48,820
Oh a pleasure, Glen Richie

613
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,530
You are the one that killed
to one of their patients

614
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:55,476
it was a joke

615
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:57,658
If it was joke, I understand it

616
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:01,100
Finally somebody understands it

617
00:52:07,141 --> 00:52:10,838
He/she makes a lot that I am not out

618
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:13,904
Something new that to say?

619
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,405
- It is good
- Do you joke?

620
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:21,685
this type has a
social problem

621
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:23,864
I tell it to you, they have a social calendar

622
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:25,297
better than none

623
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:29,904
if for some reason salts

624
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,410
there won't be reason

625
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:34,159
But it is not so bad here

626
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:41,758
I am addicted to that

627
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:50,461
Pardon

628
00:52:52,576 --> 00:52:56,169
It would bother you if I sit down next to you

629
00:52:57,037 --> 00:52:58,865
No, it sounds very well but... 

630
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:01,062
 ... I don't believe that it is good idea

631
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:05,141
I have a great partner
and it would violate me for that reason

632
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:12,200
It is my luck

633
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:14,345
I should know that they would take you

634
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:22,464
That but I can say

635
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:28,553
Do you know that? to the devil, we are alone
two people enjoying their company

636
00:53:32,736 --> 00:53:35,270
To who he cares, I say
first the security

637
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,312
The heat

638
00:53:52,738 --> 00:53:54,151
The life is interesting

639
00:53:58,557 --> 00:54:01,768
He/she looks, you that you already have owner

640
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:04,503
And I respect that totally

641
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:08,726
But your and I are
so similar

642
00:54:09,484 --> 00:54:13,313
When I pass that of this type, I said
the life is interesting and your also said it

643
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:17,624
It is the type of moments
of those that I speak

644
00:54:19,496 --> 00:54:23,309
I sometimes wonder as serious if
it was me the one that violated you every night

645
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:27,870
you know

646
00:54:28,117 --> 00:54:31,317
I believe that I sit down the energy
of our friendship

647
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,363
- and you project it in something that is not
- No, me not... 

648
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:40,765
 ... I don't project it

649
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:47,181
I can see you without you chewed
as if we were in another side

650
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:49,912
you would hit me in the mouth

651
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,367
and it would violate you

652
00:54:54,815 --> 00:54:56,175
Without your consent, clear

653
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,628
That is very valiant

654
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:03,088
Of that it is violating

655
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,741
- He/she looks and I have listened
- But

656
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:14,313
I cannot simply change

657
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:16,977
it is not so simple

658
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:25,307
- I will already fix it
- Not be of the type... 

659
00:55:25,307 --> 00:55:27,010
Not I can

660
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:32,417
I don't have left it a lot,
see you later

661
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:47,535
To where chingados
do you believe that you go?

662
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:14,405
Buster, we have to speak

663
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:18,076
Oh not, don't tell me

664
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:24,007
Dwayne

665
00:56:26,874 --> 00:56:32,285
Not it is easy, Dwayne asked me him to be its dog,
and I am not sure of wanting or... 

666
00:56:32,545 --> 00:56:34,628
 ... noq to want to be their dog

667
00:56:36,238 --> 00:56:37,502
Tell me that it is joke

668
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,553
No, this time not

669
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:45,534
We have gone by moments
emotional, we know it

670
00:56:45,831 --> 00:56:49,065
this cell explains to it but that anything

671
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:53,717
wise that this day it would arrive

672
00:56:57,278 --> 00:57:00,775
Listen to me...  you have to make
what you have to make

673
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:03,937
Whenever your ass
be violated

674
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,601
I suppose that it will be this way

675
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:07,645
for somebody who is

676
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:09,547
every night

677
00:57:12,173 --> 00:57:13,532
and it is what it cares

678
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,972
he/she joked

679
00:57:28,138 --> 00:57:28,985
ahead

680
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,699
long of here

681
00:57:32,487 --> 00:57:33,393

00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:45,912

683
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:52,378
he/she read a paper but

684
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,487
I can make it but late

685
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,294
that it happens?

686
00:57:58,114 --> 00:58:00,152
speak with the great buster and... 

687
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:03,184
 ... it seems that I take it well

688
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:08,471
this is wonderful

689
00:58:11,812 --> 00:58:12,930
Do you know what means, not?

690
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:13,729

691
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:17,168

692
00:58:34,895 --> 00:58:38,160
The king is the but big

693
00:58:39,425 --> 00:58:42,612
All that I have made

694
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:44,839
It has been expressed intensely

695
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:48,528
The life is to delight

696
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:51,071
day by day

697
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:53,321
The hours will be patient

698
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,984
and yours... 

699
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:59,096
 ... leave it in our hands

700
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:02,707
and take you our hearts

701
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:05,542
Everything is this way

00:59:27,018 --> 00:59:27,982
Do make state drinking?

703
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,904
No, alone a little

00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:37,013
I believe that we have that

01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:17,752
And me Gary and I renounce

720
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:21,415
- Gary
- Your you are the one that has the hand in my ass

721
01:01:22,997 --> 01:01:25,908
- Or somebody laughs enough
- He/she leaves alone the girl

722
01:01:25,908 --> 01:01:27,530
To the chingada, as you call yourself affection?

723
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,517
- Me?
- Undoubtedly to you, I don't speak with your boyfriend

724
01:01:36,265 --> 01:01:39,511
Hey Kelly because you don't wait for me
after the show and I will show you my hooter

725
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,774
Not it is amusing

726
01:01:43,053 --> 01:01:45,201
He/she allows to hear what Gary says

727
01:01:45,475 --> 01:01:48,165
- Idiot
- When he/she says you can unite

728
01:01:50,092 --> 01:01:51,965
He/she is a great comedian

729
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:55,863
Oh my God

730
01:01:57,501 --> 01:02:00,593
I believe that it was part of the act

731
01:02:00,896 --> 01:02:03,277
can you be quiet one second?

732
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,681
Affection is our moon
of honey, we should take champagne

733
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:11,569
- To return to the room
- Please, I have just had dinner

734
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:15,282
hello friends

735
01:02:15,546 --> 01:02:17,243
- We love the show
- Thank you

736
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:19,196
Can I speak with Gary?

737
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,045
Clear

738
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:31,505
Hey baby, is glad me
that you liked the show

739
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:34,672
For that don't come undone of the one
and we will be able to speak

740
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:38,645
You showed me your hard verga
as you said?

741
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:43,785
I already have to leave

742
01:02:44,003 --> 01:02:46,482
Well for that doesn't leave
that Gary comes with us

743
01:02:46,692 --> 01:02:49,870
- Affection believes that... 
- I will hit you in the face

744
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,160
That Gary says,
we go to the field

745
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:56,843
This a little tired
good night

746
01:02:57,964 --> 01:03:00,832
You are maybe... 

747
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:04,392
Not I am gay because I go out with small

748
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:06,585
and Gary is not Gay because
he/she is a marionette

749
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:08,360
that I bought in a company
in Chicago

750
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,236
Good night

751
01:03:14,184 --> 01:03:15,766
Kelly, we go... 

752
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:30,234
He/she hoped to lose the virginity
tonight

753
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:32,733
I have go to walk

754
01:03:32,956 --> 01:03:34,923
Really? Because it would rot... 

755
01:03:36,476 --> 01:03:37,379
 ... to go with you

756
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,709
hello

757
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:04,434
I have many condoms

758
01:04:05,578 --> 01:04:08,074
I want to make it

759
01:05:23,183 --> 01:05:24,888
Does he/she know where was the it finishes time?

760
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,171
thank you to call to the police

761
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:17,625
We should call to the police

762
01:06:27,244 --> 01:06:28,116
I sit down it

763
01:06:28,441 --> 01:06:30,233
I thought that him toward
but not

764
01:06:30,475 --> 01:06:32,888
I had never felt
so happy for a long time

765
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:37,465
we always make the same jokes
I no longer find amusing

766
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:41,643
Your you were there when my engaged one
it was buried

767
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:44,074
- And it continues there
- it continues there

768
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:47,626
You said that taenias girlfriend, but
when it was the it finishes time that you came out?

769
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:53,312
She dies to go out with you

770
01:06:54,645 --> 01:06:56,111
Do how many point out you need?

771
01:06:56,393 --> 01:06:57,997
then our marriage
it is a farce

772
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:12,500
perhaps be right

773
01:07:15,145 --> 01:07:16,761
You that I am right

774
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,039
I am for sure to her
he would love to hear that of you

775
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:58,664
It is a madness

776
01:08:57,156 --> 01:08:58,182
That you make here?

777
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,521
Gretchen...  hello it was

778
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,766
I thought that it could happen
to shit

779
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:08,139
Not it is a good moment
for that don't return tomorrow?

780
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:10,026
Can I enter for single 5 minutes?

781
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:11,661
Tomorrow perhaps doesn't have
necessity to shit

782
01:09:12,953 --> 01:09:13,824
Who this in the door?

783
01:09:15,874 --> 01:09:18,983

787
01:09:28,673 --> 01:09:30,211
In fact we look for a ponny

788
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,750
A ponny can be
delicious

789
01:09:35,106 --> 01:09:38,899
As I said, it is not moment
so that you shit

790
01:09:40,873 --> 01:09:42,735
But it was good to see you,
you are brilliant

791
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:45,520
It is always well you

792
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:47,362
You are tired

793
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:50,031
- These taking...

794
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:54,461
I can speak for five minutes
without you attack me for that reason?

795
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:58,387
- Rot then
- Am I taking my Oega Trifásico, ok?

796
01:09:58,604 --> 01:10:00,128
Alone that not in the same way

797
01:10:01,802 --> 01:10:02,985
It is for that reason

798
01:10:04,822 --> 01:10:05,971
If it is for that reason

799
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:07,785
That you are lucky, Jeff

800
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:10,230
Also your, Gretchen

801
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:30,568
NOT YOU LIFTED REINFORCEMENT TESTIMONY

802
01:11:02,996 --> 01:11:04,087
The new one this awake one

803
01:11:05,087 --> 01:11:06,964
As not, if it hurts me
the head

804
01:11:08,585 --> 01:11:10,219
And definitively I will need something but

805
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:12,026
you to what you refer

806
01:11:12,276 --> 01:11:14,497
You Need a Lionel Rynold

807
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:19,046
It is always the shit
for that lick this way it?

808
01:11:21,621 --> 01:11:24,998
It is a good question and
there is a history, friend

809
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:28,451
León Renold, in fact existed

810
01:11:30,927 --> 01:11:35,066
Before that he/she lived in New York

811
01:11:35,066 --> 01:11:38,957
No, the history begins before

812
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:40,781
Did you count your history or mine?

813
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:45,946
The first in the history of he/she Quarrels
it is when it left the school

814
01:11:46,311 --> 01:11:49,033
And I work AD in Washington

815
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:52,719
He/she opened locks

816
01:11:53,485 --> 01:11:55,915
It was difficult because
not taenia fingers

817
01:11:56,176 --> 01:11:58,275
Their prostitute open door wants
take

818
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:01,235
You paid for that reason, he/she Quarrels!

819
01:12:03,745 --> 01:12:05,390
So for that reason they call
to this Life does Quarrel?

820
01:12:05,657 --> 01:12:07,655
There is but in the history

821
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:11,271
Some years later, he/she Quarrels
he/she worked in the streets

822
01:12:11,509 --> 01:12:15,840
- Give me one second
- Not I do have toa the night, does it work or that?

823
01:12:16,062 --> 01:12:17,842
Don't speak to me, leave me
to concentrate

824
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:21,414
Do you know that? Forget it

825
01:12:22,731 --> 01:12:24,207
God that passes them

826
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:26,165
For that reason he/she was not able to
to maintain a work

827
01:12:27,727 --> 01:12:29,230
He/she wanted to play the piano

828
01:12:39,307 --> 01:12:40,717
- These discharged
- That?

829
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:42,880
Because I sit down passion
for this reason?

830
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:57,596
- If
- Do you know that I knew?

831
01:12:58,501 --> 01:13:03,656
That it is of the racist organization

832
01:13:04,528 --> 01:13:06,271
If, it is this way

833
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:09,352
Undoubtedly if

834
01:13:19,713 --> 01:13:21,911
Finally he/she Quarrels he/she found something
in what was good

835
01:13:22,188 --> 01:13:23,679
To say lies

836
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:29,635
You know that she sucks him/her
the eggs to somebody in a party?

837
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:33,960
Wise that your he/she suckles
was it in and prostitutes' service?

838
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,994
Take away from the director, he/she wants
to catch to all the children

839
01:13:40,368 --> 01:13:44,296
- He/she quarrels it was in the summit of the world
- Does he/she quarrel that there is?

840
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:03,185
Aaron, you knew that that
did it pass the lizard?

841
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:05,386
You knew what passed him/her
to your face?

842
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:17,791
Until he/she heard something

843
01:14:18,222 --> 01:14:20,297
Evil dogs
really

844
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:23,351
And all were infected
to if same

845
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:26,601
With an illness of
transmission sexual human

846
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:28,575
and they planned to begin an orgy

847
01:14:28,816 --> 01:14:30,166
to infect to the whole town

848
01:14:31,312 --> 01:14:34,170
This way the one Quarrels he/she wanted to notice
to all

849
01:14:34,606 --> 01:14:37,345
A moment for that those dogs were infected
with a mortal illness?

850
01:14:40,169 --> 01:14:41,679
They were immune

851
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,327
Listen all, don't have
sex with the dogs

852
01:14:45,532 --> 01:14:49,073
they plan to have an orgy

853
01:14:50,702 --> 01:14:52,948
You always lie for that
we should believe you

854
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:57,159
Hey has gender together all

855
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:01,623
- Not you
- To who you will believe him/her to he/she Quarrels or to the winning dog

856
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:36,316
It began to lose weight

857
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:43,836
For that reason they call to this
Does Liar Quarrel?

858
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,606
Because it is the same thing
every day

859
01:15:47,628 --> 01:15:49,108
gentlemen

860
01:15:51,348 --> 01:15:53,491
- See you later friends
- That the one is he/she Quarrels?

861
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:00,456
This is the place
it is not necessary a lot to look

862
01:16:01,368 --> 01:16:02,663
What you see is what there is

863
01:16:03,444 --> 01:16:05,006
That you waited for 850 a month

864
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:09,346
What you see is what there is

865
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:11,159
or that you waited for
850 a month

866
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:14,548
The station MIR there out

867
01:16:15,506 --> 01:16:16,300
In the space?

868
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:17,865
I take it to me

869
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:19,682
Sr. dalton

870
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:22,420
- Dalton...  Timothy Dalton
- As the 007

871
01:16:23,427 --> 01:16:24,413
It is this way

872
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:28,092
The keys

873
01:16:29,394 --> 01:16:32,263
NOT YOU WILL MAKE ADULTERY

874
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:01,732
As you have been?

875
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:04,125
Your dilo first

876
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:07,597
As this Liz?

877
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:08,836
we finish

878
01:17:09,151 --> 01:17:10,609
she was very young

879
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:13,591
- As this Jim
- Not I work

880
01:17:14,806 --> 01:17:16,066
Their penis is too big

881
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:18,368
I say, for a while
it was grandiose

882
01:17:19,588 --> 01:17:21,178
God, very well

883
01:17:21,923 --> 01:17:23,287
I sometimes think of that and.

884
01:17:24,154 --> 01:17:25,467
 ... I have a small orgasm

885
01:17:28,569 --> 01:17:31,146
No...  oh waits

886
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:33,433
Here he/she comes

887
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:36,922
But you know, I don't work

888
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,936
- And where you live?
- I have this new home

889
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:43,944
It is an empty place
without stone charts

890
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:46,453
That good that changed

891
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:51,480
Gretchen could never apologize

892
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,489
For what I happen

893
01:17:56,222 --> 01:17:57,433
You came out of you limit them

894
01:17:57,433 --> 01:17:59,330
I should never tell it to you

895
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:01,244
not after him
that I happen with-

896
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:05,057
 ... with you and your brother

897
01:18:06,245 --> 01:18:07,070
thank you

898
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,184
Perhaps you would want.

899
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,910
 ... a cup of coffee

900
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:19,073
I would love it, but after finishing
with Liz, let us marry and I won't make the same error

901
01:18:19,289 --> 01:18:21,019
you already know, adultery

902
01:18:24,343 --> 01:18:26,221
With who you married?

903
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,474
it is brilliant

904
01:18:27,691 --> 01:18:31,175
- The star of Broadway
- oh if this prides of that

905
01:18:31,421 --> 01:18:33,086
and also of the oscar

906
01:18:33,301 --> 01:18:35,645
I see that it has been useful

907
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,647
it is as "thank you"

908
01:18:40,551 --> 01:18:42,047
- that good to see you
- equally

909
01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:03,079
Gretchen loves you so much
I want you to return

910
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:04,680
If. no

911
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,512
that there is of your wife

912
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:10,216
I will call him/her and I will tell him/her
that he/she finished

913
01:19:13,437 --> 01:19:14,710
Diane

914
01:19:15,948 --> 01:19:17,198
As these?

915
01:19:18,312 --> 01:19:19,675
that?

916
01:19:19,902 --> 01:19:21,266
150 dollars

917
01:19:23,161 --> 01:19:24,737
As if he/she shitted dollars

918
01:19:25,526 --> 01:19:26,660
Him you, terrible work

919
01:19:26,955 --> 01:19:30,140
he/she looks, I have you bad news

920
01:19:30,415 --> 01:19:32,201
I saw. to my former wife Gretchen

921
01:19:32,404 --> 01:19:35,402
and...  as I will say it

922
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:40,769
Diane, I sit down it a lot

923
01:19:41,464 --> 01:19:42,332
Really?

924
01:19:44,094 --> 01:19:47,234
You are brilliant, we could make it

925
01:19:48,628 --> 01:19:50,802
I will make that my lawyers
do send you the documents, ok?

926
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:54,271
This well, I will make it

927
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:57,887
I have to leave

928
01:20:00,155 --> 01:20:01,579
I have to leave, Diane

929
01:20:14,468 --> 01:20:17,727
YOU SANCTIFIED ON SUNDAYS
AND DAYS OF PARTY

930
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:34,214
we will arrive late at the church

931
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:36,301
the children are already in the car

932
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,396
I am sick, I believe that
they have poisoned me

933
01:20:44,182 --> 01:20:45,424
You should go without my

934
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:32,414
Totally naked?

935
01:21:32,623 --> 01:21:34,216
completely naked

936
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:35,577
The whole time that
they left to the church

937
01:21:35,577 --> 01:21:36,850
The whole morning

938
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:39,138
He/she is intriguing Oliver

939
01:21:40,869 --> 01:21:41,987
And I eat it was you on Sunday

940
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,218
- we could be together
- That I will tell to Gina

941
01:21:44,218 --> 01:21:45,313
It invents an excuse

942
01:21:47,095 --> 01:21:48,344
- That?
- Buimia

943
01:21:50,642 --> 01:21:52,052
- It is something gay'
- No

944
01:21:54,214 --> 01:21:55,260
I am very heterosexual

945
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,621
I like girls

946
01:21:57,828 --> 01:22:02,231
But even so I like life

947
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:04,076
We are alone a couple
of types heteros

948
01:22:04,306 --> 01:22:05,697
That they don't go to the church
to be naked

949
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:08,137
not you, doesn't like me

950
01:22:10,854 --> 01:22:12,942
In fact serious

951
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,428
Hey that made you
to change opinion?

952
01:22:18,665 --> 01:22:21,656
Really these nude

953
01:22:22,446 --> 01:22:24,274
that it is your penis

954
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,946
And your bottom there

955
01:22:28,164 --> 01:22:29,359
You are right

956
01:22:30,221 --> 01:22:31,657
For that not and ntras and do you take off your clothes?

957
01:22:32,356 --> 01:22:33,107
well

958
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:44,846
I have q ue to tell it to you

959
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:47,256
I thought that this serious good

960
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:49,426
But this, is very good

961
01:22:50,287 --> 01:22:51,371
Is it very good, not?

962
01:22:52,849 --> 01:22:54,255
I have many Cd's

963
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:55,608
do you want to hear something?

964
01:22:57,733 --> 01:22:59,785
Do you joke? It is my favorite one

965
01:23:00,502 --> 01:23:01,671
That we listen?

966
01:23:01,919 --> 01:23:03,216
Killing me Softly?

967
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:05,406
That is too much

968
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:07,232
We go a little but deep

969
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:11,457
That such an east

970
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:36,879
The contemporary flavor

971
01:23:37,651 --> 01:23:39,489
The grace of the universe

972
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:42,786
That was grandiose

973
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:45,687
- That well we pass it
- For that don't come next Sunday'

974
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:50,084
Not you, would feel a little guilty
if I don't go to the church

975
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,972
Marty, God not necessarily
he/she wants us to go to the church every Sunday

976
01:23:54,885 --> 01:23:58,354
Take it as being given or
rest of the normal life

977
01:23:58,578 --> 01:24:00,098
and to celebrate their great creation

978
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:03,341
And that bigger creation

979
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:09,324
For my there is not he/she swims well
that to be here, and to move the balls

980
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:13,228
It is a great point

981
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:15,016
But I have a question

982
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:17,212
To how many boys but
should he/she invite?

983
01:24:17,415 --> 01:24:19,587
On following Sunday

984
01:24:29,347 --> 01:24:30,461
Who invite it to the one?

985
01:24:32,585 --> 01:24:35,381
It is the I finish that I need

986
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:39,511
Week 5

987
01:24:40,015 --> 01:24:41,521
I like the music

988
01:24:43,688 --> 01:24:45,990
I always know them

989
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:49,374
Wise that serious good

990
01:24:49,374 --> 01:24:50,955
Week 7

991
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:55,392
And it was no longer angry
and it was completely outside of if

992
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:57,787
As their own wall

993
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:00,399
Week 9

994
01:25:16,848 --> 01:25:19,449
We finish early in the church
and your wife goes in road

995
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:37,563
This here!

996
01:25:38,295 --> 01:25:38,928
That we make?

997
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:45,740
Hello potato? as your gangrene he/she goes

998
01:25:46,909 --> 01:25:47,712
Better

999
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:50,472
Oliver, does something happen?

1000
01:25:52,095 --> 01:25:52,946
For that?

1001
01:25:53,202 --> 01:25:55,912
You act strange and I want
to know that it happens

1002
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:02,003
Affection, you deserve to know the truth

1003
01:26:03,589 --> 01:26:05,462
Friends

1004
01:26:08,684 --> 01:26:11,794
Every Sunday, dozens of
men come here

1005
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:13,100
And they get undressed

1006
01:26:13,872 --> 01:26:15,971
- I already see
- Not we go to the church again

1007
01:26:16,612 --> 01:26:17,512
That you think of that?

1008
01:26:17,724 --> 01:26:19,276
I will tell you what I think

1009
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:24,592
If you have one again
party of nudes in my house... 

1010
01:26:24,592 --> 01:26:26,066
 ... in a Domingo

1011
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:29,415
You can kiss me the bottom
when saying goodbye

1012
01:26:30,636 --> 01:26:31,746
a moment Gloria

1013
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,388
Listen to me

1014
01:26:34,049 --> 01:26:35,749
I have been a good man

1015
01:26:35,749 --> 01:26:37,730
all my life

1016
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,844
I have taken care of my children

1017
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:42,650
and to my wife

1018
01:26:44,082 --> 01:26:45,516
I give to the church

1019
01:26:48,265 --> 01:26:50,360
I never knew about flying

1020
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:52,701
I have never caught to a prostitute

1021
01:26:53,379 --> 01:26:55,269
So leave us this day

1022
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:57,513
that every Sunday

1023
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,847
we have to make this

1024
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,269
That is the worst way

1025
01:27:03,529 --> 01:27:05,301
But I felt never so well

1026
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:07,540
there was really something

1027
01:27:15,347 --> 01:27:18,432
Not this wrong to be naked
in one Sunday

1028
01:27:19,605 --> 01:27:23,271
Comely that would want to make it

1029
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,354
Present them this history

1030
01:28:01,562 --> 01:28:03,314
Not they could get lost it

1031
01:28:03,517 --> 01:28:07,997
I read that of the charts but
don't listen the wisdom

1032
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:11,891
I should never betray my wife
but I made my work

1033
01:28:12,606 --> 01:28:14,361
I gave them 10 short histories

1034
01:28:14,361 --> 01:28:18,169
And we don't die for that reason
