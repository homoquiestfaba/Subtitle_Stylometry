1
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:06,755
(film whirring)

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:10,385
(dramatic orchestral music)

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,103
(soft dramatic music)

4
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,241
(bright synth music)

5
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,413
(flame whooshing)

6
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,468
- If you're watching
this at home,

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,595
then I suggest you stay there.

8
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,764
Because with complete
pandemic lockdowns

9
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,141
lifting for the
entire country in time

10
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,768
for the holiday shopping season,

11
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,228
the promise of robust
Christmas sales

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,439
combined with lingering
supply chain issues

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,734
makes for a truly Black
Friday to kick off

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,402
the holiday shopping season,

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,488
which has been
limited to online only

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,323
for the last three years.

17
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:18,827
I must say, I feel terrible
for the retail workers.

18
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,454
- Chris!

19
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,791
I told you to watch
the door, not the TV!

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,125
- Sorry.

21
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,286
- Where are your glasses?

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,424
You need to have them on
your eyes at all times.

23
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,180
(bright orchestral music)

24
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:56,866
(phone vibrating)
(alert chiming)

25
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,339
(soft suspenseful music)

26
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,384
(door rattling)

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,344
(glasses whirring)

28
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,512
(glasses chiming)

29
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,514
- [Crowd] Let us in. Let us in.

30
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,682
- They're here.

31
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,226
- [Crowd] Let us in. Let us in.

32
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,227
Let us in.

33
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,229
Let us in.

34
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,899
Let us in.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,651
Let us in! (hands thudding)

36
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,904
Let us in!

37
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,573
Let us in!
- They want in.

38
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,242
- [Crowd] Let us in! Let us in!

39
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,870
Let us in! Let us in!

40
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,664
Let us in! Let us in!

41
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,500
- Let's get ready.

42
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,336
- [Crowd] Let us in! Let us in!

43
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,547
Let us in! Let us in!

44
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,340
- Two minutes.

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,884
- Look at them.

46
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,595
- [Crowd] Let us in! Let us in!

47
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,432
- They haven't been
free for three years.

48
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,434
No matter what,

49
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,437
we're a team,

50
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,565
and we stick together.

51
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,609
- [Crowd] Let us in! Let us in!

52
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,610
Let us in!

53
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,651
- There's so many.

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,282
- Call 911 if you have to.

55
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,323
I'll understand.

56
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,537
- [Crowd] Let us in!
Let us in! Let us in!

57
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,248
- Chris, get the door.

58
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,792
Someone hit the lights.

59
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,960
Go! Go!

60
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,464
- [Crowd] Let us in! Let us in!

61
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,635
(rising dramatic music)

62
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,395
(bright holiday music)

63
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,342
(bright holiday music continues)

64
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,497
(bright holiday music continues)

65
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,569
(bright holiday music continues)

66
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,890
(bright holiday music continues)

67
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,941
(phone vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

68
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,902
(dogs barking)

69
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,737
- Hi, Leni.

70
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,938
This is gonna be your
Christmas. I just know it.

71
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,737
Oh, hun, you know I would
take you if I could.

72
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,537
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,582
(cage clanking)

74
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,583
Come here.

75
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,962
(dogs barking)

76
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,598
- Oh, hi.

77
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,974
How can I help you?

78
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,476
- Oh, I'm just
here to see Leigh.

79
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,727
She's one of the employees.

80
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,479
- Okay, I'll page her for ya.

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,147
- Usually I just, I go back.

82
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,774
- Hey, Chris. Hi.

83
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,442
This is Chris. He's
always welcome.

84
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,736
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm new. (laughs)

85
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,817
- She's in the back.

86
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,824
Hush, my dear

87
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,992
Hold your peers

88
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:55,497
Be here in this warm embrace

89
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,791
Heed my words

90
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,085
Hear this song

91
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,005
Let my love make you strong

92
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,510
There's no need for
this heartache tonight

93
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,473
There's no reason to
shut out the light

94
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:17,644
There's no need for
us to argue and fight

95
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,605
We are together

96
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,819
And baby, it's Christmas tonight

97
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,826
- You should sing more often.

98
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,161
- My granny used to
sing me that song,

99
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,829
but you didn't hear anything.

100
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,708
I, I only sing for
puppers, not people.

101
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,878
- You should change that policy.

102
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,005
- Someone's in the
Christmas spirit.

103
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,965
I wish I could say
it looks good on you.

104
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,966
- [Chris] Wow.

105
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,677
- [Leigh] How was that
Black Friday shift?

106
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,514
- Yeah, uh, it was not good.

107
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,891
- Yikes.

108
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,227
Well, why don't you go
home and get some rest?

109
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,813
- Jenn just got back from
her parents' Thanksgiving

110
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,523
and I really don't wanna
deal with her right now.

111
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,649
- Oh.

112
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,026
You and your dad didn't go?

113
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,819
- [Chris] No, her
parents hate my dad, so.

114
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,237
- Really?

115
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,906
- Yeah.

116
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,159
- So is her dad older
or younger than yours?

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,872
- My dad is two years
younger than her dad.

118
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,915
- Yikes.

119
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,541
- I mean, they're 20 years apart

120
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,751
and she wants to
be my new mother,

121
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,753
but like I can't
let that happen.

122
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,214
- Yeah, I get it.

123
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,841
Well, you and your dad
should've came over

124
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,259
to my house for Thanksgiving.

125
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,055
My mom made an amazing
turkey that my dad

126
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,765
could not stop raving about.

127
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,059
- I might take you
up on that next time.

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,268
Jenn was talking to
my dad about inviting

129
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,728
my grandpa over for Christmas,

130
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,065
so I might need to be rescued.

131
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,776
- Really? Rescued from what?

132
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,611
- So what's your beef?

133
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,862
- Beef?
- Beef.

134
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,113
Problem. Issue.

135
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,281
- I don't have any beef.

136
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,282
- You don't?
- No.

137
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,617
- No?
- No.

138
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,743
- You're 16.
- Right.

139
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,286
- You got plans?
- Plans?

140
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,747
- Plans after graduation.
- I'm not sure.

141
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,123
- You're not sure?
- That's right.

142
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,750
- What kind of a kid isn't sure?

143
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,876
- A kid like me, I guess.

144
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,253
- How are you gonna make it?

145
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,294
- My good looks.

146
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,093
- Your grandpa sounds
like a great time.

147
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,930
- He's just obsessed
with me goin' to college.

148
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,224
I don't think he understands
that I don't need college.

149
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,059
I have the greatest
job in the world.

150
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,605
I sell overhyped technology
to gullible consumers.

151
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,274
- Hey, at least you have money.

152
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,651
- I can get you a job at the
shop if that's what you want.

153
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,111
- It's not that I
want a job there.

154
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,322
I just, I would like to
start this pet sitting,

155
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,324
dog walking service, you know?

156
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,327
It just sounds like a dream.

157
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,448
- What's stoppin' ya?

158
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,331
- There's so many
start-up costs,

159
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,126
and insurance, and
I have to be bonded,

160
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,295
and a website, and you know,

161
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,171
a million other things
that I need to buy.

162
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,301
It's just a lot
of start-up costs.

163
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,345
- Yeah.

164
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,681
I bet Christmas is a great
time for these dogs, though.

165
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,141
- Yeah.

166
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,686
My (chuckles), my granny
used to say that Santa

167
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,815
would come and get these
guys homes for Christmas.

168
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,650
I wish that were true.

169
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,153
- Who knows, maybe Santa
can get me a new family.

170
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,196
- You have a family.

171
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,325
Go spend some time with them.

172
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,326
- Humbug.

173
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,787
- Merry Christmas.

174
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:30,129
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

175
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,844
(lighthearted holiday music)

176
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,877
- Off to work?

177
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,421
- Looks that way.

178
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,582
- Can I pack you a
sandwich or something?

179
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,761
You're right.

180
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:25,434
- Yeah, um, I'm late, so have
fun with whatever this is.

181
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,192
(soft gentle music)

182
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,092
(soft sentimental music)

183
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,295
(lighthearted holiday music)

184
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:13,209
(lighthearted holiday
music continues)

185
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,251
(string lights clattering)

186
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:01,257
- [Instructor] You are strong
and capable and powerful.

187
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,426
You can do this.

188
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,096
Now hold that pose

189
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,266
and remember to breathe.

190
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,563
(lighthearted holiday music)

191
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,202
- No way do I have your touch.

192
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,302
(soft sentimental music)

193
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,649
Thank you for this.

194
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,155
(soft sentimental music)

195
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,461
(door closes)

196
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,130
- Jenn, you home?

197
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,174
Jenn?

198
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,176
- Where else would I be?

199
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,303
(kiss smacking)

200
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,013
- [Jim] I'll never get tired
of being greeted like this.

201
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,514
- Mmm, I expected
you home an hour ago.

202
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,308
Where have you been?

203
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,601
- Oh, I had just
something to take care of.

204
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,270
You know, that divorce case?

205
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,022
I can't talk about it.

206
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,649
I cannot disclose.

207
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,025
No big deal.
- Very weird.

208
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,526
You're being very weird.

209
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,612
- [Jim] No, I'm not.
- [Jenn] Mmm-hmm.

210
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,293
- No, I'm not.
- Yup.

211
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,282
Okay, fine.

212
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,660
- So this is really somethin'.

213
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,163
- Yeah, well, I, uh,

214
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,374
it'll be better once
the tree is done.

215
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,002
So if you could help me with
that, that would be great.

216
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,048
(Jenn sighs)

217
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,175
It's a family holiday, Jim.

218
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,302
She's family.

219
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,673
- Any word from Alf
about Christmas dinner?

220
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,309
- Well, I think he's coming.

221
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,187
It's hard to tell
because he just got

222
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:25,191
a new smartphone and
his texting, not great.

223
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,068
- Really?

224
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,736
He's had one of those senior
citizen flip phones forever.

225
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,363
It's big with big numbers.

226
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,031
- Yeah, well, I guess
he's trying to catch up

227
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,700
with the times.

228
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,702
Everyone else said
they're coming, though.

229
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,743
That's for sure.

230
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,206
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?

231
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,541
- Jim, really.

232
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,502
It's gonna be good,
for everybody.

233
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,213
- The lawyer in me
needs to make sure

234
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,257
you understand and I
disclose that this is

235
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,717
all Amy's side of the family,

236
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,593
and they could be
a little strange.

237
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,430
- Your brother Pat
is gonna be there.

238
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,432
- You'll love Funcle Pat.

239
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,433
Everybody loves Pat.

240
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,059
The kids worship him.

241
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
If fun had a name,
it would be Pat.

242
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,438
- That's weird.

243
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,732
I thought fun
already had a name,

244
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,068
and it was, hold on.

245
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,361
Oh, it's fun.

246
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,779
- Oh, is that a bit?

247
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,614
You doing stand-up now?

248
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,283
- What about Alf?

249
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,324
He seems like the
life of the party.

250
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,365
- You could say that.

251
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,457
- [Alf] I warned
ya! (kid wailing)

252
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,658
There's only room for one
old man at this house!

253
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,131
That's the last time that
fat geezer ruins the roof.

254
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,467
Venison for everybody!

255
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,388
- I'm sorry. That's awful.

256
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,308
I don't want this to be awkward.

257
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,768
Maybe I'm overstepping.

258
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,437
I can just as easily
go to my parents'.

259
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,230
- No, no, no.

260
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,648
I'm sure they'd be
very happy with that,

261
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,729
but we want ya here.

262
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,153
- Does we include Chris?

263
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,614
- I appreciate
everything you're doing.

264
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,325
The decorations and
bringing everybody together.

265
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,494
It's really nice.

266
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,868
- Well, do you think
he'll be excited?

267
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,500
- Let's just hold
off on telling him

268
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,170
till we make sure nobody
cancels, you know?

269
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,545
Just give it time.

270
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,719
Then we'll tell
him together, okay?

271
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,803
- Okay.

272
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,435
(soft solemn music)

273
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,297
(soft solemn music continues)

274
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,849
(Leigh sighs)

275
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,229
(phone ringing)

276
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,564
- [Mom] Hello?

277
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,482
- Um, hi, Mom.

278
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,734
- [Mom] Who is this?

279
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,696
- It's, it's me.

280
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,410
Um, I was just calling to see
how your Thanksgiving went.

281
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,374
Um, and if it'd be okay if
I came up for Christmas?

282
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,037
- [Mom] If you want
something, call your father.

283
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,214
- I, I don't want anything.

284
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,215
I...

285
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,221
It's not like I can
reach Dad anyway.

286
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,264
You know that.

287
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,602
(Leigh sighs)

288
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,396
I'm living with some
friends right now, um.

289
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,939
- [Mom] What do I
care? You're an adult.

290
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,275
Stop calling me.

291
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,778
(phone beeps)

292
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,577
(bright holiday music)

293
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,261
(soft gentle music)

294
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,977
(knuckles rapping)
- Dad?

295
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,978
Dad?

296
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,944
- How was work?

297
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,613
- Stupid. What are you doin'?

298
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,656
- Laundry.

299
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,495
- So, um, I have this friend
who wants to start a business.

300
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,498
- What kind of business does
your friend wanna start?

301
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,499
- It's not me, Dad.

302
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,959
It's this girl I know.

303
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,835
I just thought we
could help her out.

304
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,338
- Did she ask for your help?

305
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,298
- No.

306
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,299
- Chris, just ask her out.

307
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,801
- It's not like that.

308
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,802
- Sure. Of course not.

309
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,844
What do I know.

310
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,471
- Forget I asked.

311
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,306
- It's perfectly
natural to be nervous.

312
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,933
- I'm not nervous.

313
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,518
- Then why concoct this
scheme to be around this girl

314
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,978
instead of just asking
her out like a man?

315
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,479
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I understand.

316
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,314
- Wait. Hold on.

317
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,315
Don't act as if it didn't
take you a whole year

318
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,651
to ask me out, Jim.

319
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,906
I still had to make
the first move.

320
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,492
- See, that's more of an our
generation type of thing.

321
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,830
- What's that supposed to mean?

322
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,832
- He just called you old.

323
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,913
Or me young. I'm
not really sure.

324
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:42,467
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

325
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,512
- If she's really serious
and wants to make money,

326
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,888
she's gonna have to
file a business name

327
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,849
and create an
LLC. (Chris sighs)

328
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,018
- You're really gonna help
her with this, aren't you?

329
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,520
So sweet.
- Okay, shh.

330
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,813
Just doing some
undercover research.

331
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,023
Don't tell anyone, please.

332
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,024
- Yeah, uh-huh.

333
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,400
You like her, don't ya?

334
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,860
- No.

335
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,737
- Just admit it.
(employee chuckles)

336
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,363
- Do you really think
she needs an LLC?

337
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,698
- Yes, and insurance.

338
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,366
She's gonna have to get bonded.

339
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,410
- You two really do
make a cute couple.

340
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,705
(gasps) What if you get married?

341
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,375
Oh my gosh, they would
have the cutest babies.

342
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,752
- What?
- [Employee] Oh my gosh!

343
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,753
- She really could
use something positive

344
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,920
in her life right now.

345
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,047
That poor girl. She's all alone.

346
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,089
- Wait. What about her parents?

347
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,591
- Oh, you didn't hear?

348
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,384
Oh, they ditched her.

349
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,721
She is living in this disgusting
basement apartment thing

350
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,598
with her friends.

351
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,766
- I took her home from
work the other day

352
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,101
and I was scared for my life.

353
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,771
Anyway, my brother's
an insurance agent.

354
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,440
I should totally introduce you.

355
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,406
(lighthearted holiday music)

356
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,914
- I'm rockin'!

357
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,455
- All right, Jack!

358
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,061
- What's the verdict, boss?

359
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,772
- It's really comin' together.

360
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,482
- Thank you.

361
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,776
You okay? What's wrong?

362
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,656
(soft solemn music)

363
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,796
- Don't think I've
ever seen this one.

364
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,509
- Good news, bud.

365
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,677
We're having Christmas
Eve dinner here,

366
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,096
and the whole family's comin'.

367
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,640
It will be just like
when you were a kid.

368
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,475
Everyone.

369
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,596
Grandpa, Aunt Mandy,
Uncle Matt, your cousins.

370
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,813
- And?

371
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,649
- Funcle Pat.
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,528
(soft gentle music)

373
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,990
How long has it been since
everybody got together?

374
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,952
- Well, Amy was sick for two
years before the shutdown.

375
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,953
- Stop.

376
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,833
(soft gentle music)

377
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,637
(Chris crying)

378
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,727
(soft solemn music)

379
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,237
(Chris sniffs)

380
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,822
They're acting like
you don't matter.

381
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,701
Like you never existed.

382
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,040
I can't forget that
Christmas was your day.

383
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,254
(Chris sniffling)

384
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,886
(Chris breathing heavily)

385
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,269
(tense dramatic music)

386
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,270
(knuckles rapping)

387
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,606
Fuck! Come on.

388
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,743
What's up, Dad? (Jim sighs)

389
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,954
- Look, she's
trying her best, I-

390
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,955
- [Chris] I know.

391
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,409
- This is all new to
her and I should've,

392
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,586
just please be patient.

393
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,627
- I don't want her
doing my laundry.

394
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,923
- Okay.

395
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,926
I get it.

396
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,887
She's just, uh- -
Trying too hard.

397
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,807
- Look, with this Christmas
Eve dinner coming up,

398
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,060
we all have to figure
out a way to get along.

399
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,852
Can I count on you?

400
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,148
- You know it's
gonna be hard seeing

401
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,651
everyone else without her.

402
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,611
- I know.

403
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,615
(soft gentle music)

404
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,298
(glasses vibrating)

405
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,634
(dog barking)

406
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,845
- Good morning, Leni.

407
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,338
I brought your favorite!

408
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,271
I might spend
Christmas with you.

409
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,150
Don't get adopted
before then, okay?

410
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,318
All right.

411
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,824
- Get adopted till when?

412
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,035
- Oh, nothing. What?

413
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,661
- Smooth.

414
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,706
So, remember when
I said my grandpa

415
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,124
might be coming to Christmas

416
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,043
and I'd probably
need to be rescued?

417
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,835
- Yeah.

418
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,211
- Well, now my whole
family's comin' to Christmas,

419
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,131
and I definitely
need to be rescued.

420
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,799
- Oh, uh, Chris.

421
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,160
- I'm not asking to bail
on your family's plans.

422
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,721
But do you think it
would be possible

423
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,723
for you to come to my
house on Christmas Eve?

424
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,683
- I might have to talk
to my family first.

425
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,352
- Okay, before you commit,

426
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,372
I need to let you know
what you're getting into.

427
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,314
- Okay.

428
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,899
- So every year we play
this White Elephant game.

429
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,359
My grandpa likes to
put lousy gifts in

430
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,069
and a ball of cash and
everyone fights over it,

431
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,404
and he calls it
Christmas Cage Match.

432
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,031
- Interesting.

433
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:43,327
- My Aunt Mandy is neurotic.

434
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,247
My cousins Kelli and
Cole are total nerds,

435
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,832
especially Kelli.

436
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,250
She's like this frumpy
little book worm

437
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,752
that would rather
read the dictionary

438
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,170
than have a
conversation with you.

439
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,214
So, my Uncle Matt is
scared of my Aunt Mandy,

440
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,049
so he doesn't really talk,

441
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,219
and nobody knows what's
going on inside of his head.

442
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,888
- Is there anyone else I
should be worried about?

443
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,014
- Yes.

444
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,724
My dad's brother, Uncle Pat.

445
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,726
We call him Funcle Pat.

446
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,353
If he can't make you
smile, you're not human.

447
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,938
No one really knows
what he's gonna do next,

448
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,398
and he's probably
the only person

449
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,274
I'm looking forward to seeing.

450
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,069
- Wow, it sounds like every
family needs a Funcle Pat.

451
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,196
- Yeah, yeah.

452
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,409
- I guess I could go.

453
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,130
- [Chris] You'll come?
- Yeah.

454
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:34,087
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

455
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,052
(Jim humming)

456
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,653
- [Jim] Hey.
- Hey.

457
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,765
- Are you making
Amy's applesauce?

458
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,934
- Yeah. Tell me I can do this.

459
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,895
- You can do this.
- Thank you.

460
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,940
- And if you can't,
you're still incredible.

461
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,900
And we have lots of cheeses.

462
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,819
- Oh, that's good.

463
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,487
- And you could always fall
back on your amazing looks.

464
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,489
- For how long?
- Forever.

465
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,116
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Sweet-

466
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,160
- [Chris] Oh, come on. Gross.

467
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,494
Ugh.

468
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,329
- Did you clean your room?

469
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,123
- I don't think we're
goin' into my room.

470
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,124
- Take out the trash
when you go out.

471
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,086
And then come back
and clean your room.

472
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,087
- Wanna nail him?
He's still there.

473
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,427
- I'm rockin'!

474
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,514
- All right, Jack!

475
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,478
(lighthearted holiday music)

476
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,440
(glasses whirring)

477
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,110
(bell chiming)

478
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,493
(light plucky music)

479
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,477
(Chris panting)

480
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,070
(soft suspenseful music)

481
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,578
(glasses whirring)

482
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,207
(bell chimes)

483
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,543
(Chris laughs)

484
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,549
(door creaks) (clothes flop)

485
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:54,936
(Chris sighs) (tense
dramatic music)

486
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,441
(light plucky music)

487
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,368
(Chris sighs)

488
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,247
(light plucky music)

489
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,375
(door clangs)

490
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,421
(light plucky music)

491
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:39,271
(soft suspenseful music)

492
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:44,277
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

493
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,116
- How was work?

494
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,237
- What are you doin'?

495
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,162
- Laundry.

496
00:31:55,163 --> 00:32:00,168
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

497
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,133
Sorry, bud. Occupato.

498
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:15,350
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

499
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,656
(suspenseful Old West music)

500
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,662
Work?

501
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,538
- Bad.

502
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,124
- Food?

503
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,670
- Got it.

504
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,548
- Girl?

505
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,549
- Bye, Dad.

506
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,180
(suspenseful Old West music)

507
00:32:55,181 --> 00:33:00,144
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

508
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,232
Dad, come on. I
need to do laundry.

509
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,358
- [Jim] Sorry. (loud thudding)

510
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,735
Ow! Oh! No can do.

511
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:15,576
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

512
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,256
(soft solemn music)

513
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,767
(Jim crying)

514
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:59,287
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

515
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,754
(Chris screaming)
(rising dramatic music)

516
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,258
(soft introspective music)

517
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,312
- [Friend] Hey,
we're headin' out.

518
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,230
Please make sure you
lock up when you leave.

519
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,107
It's the least you can do.

520
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,151
- Wait, I thought you were
gonna give me a ride later.

521
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,312
- [Friend] Babe? Babe?

522
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,114
- [Friend] What?

523
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,824
- [Friend] Did you say we'd
give Leigh a ride tonight?

524
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,493
- [Friend] What?

525
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,745
- [Friend] Did you say
that we would give Leigh

526
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,289
a ride tonight?

527
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,532
- [Friend] A ride where?

528
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,835
- [Friend] Yeah, we don't
remember saying that.

529
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,504
- But I-

530
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,422
- [Friend] Let's go.
We're gonna be late!

531
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,341
- [Friend] Sorry, kid.

532
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,467
You're gonna have to figure
it out for yourself tonight.

533
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,302
Let us know how it goes.

534
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,679
(door closes)

535
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
- Ugh.

536
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,810
(door opens)

537
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,686
- [Friend] Please make sure
you lock up when you leave.

538
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,315
(door closes)

539
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,194
- We have one too many, hon.

540
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,235
- Oh, no we don't.

541
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,698
- No, Jim.

542
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,493
We don't.

543
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,873
- Yeah.

544
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,209
(phone vibrating)

545
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,504
Oh.

546
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,673
What does this mean?

547
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,302
- I, mmm. (Jim laughs)

548
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,303
I don't know.

549
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,514
(glasses whirring)

550
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,723
- Fire.

551
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,517
(missile blasting)

552
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,227
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

553
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,813
Ugh.

554
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,690
(knuckles rapping)

555
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,690
- [Jim] Chris?

556
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,526
Your door's locked.

557
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,527
- I know.

558
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,574
- [Jim] Can you just do me
a favor and text Grandpa

559
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,575
to see if you can
tell what he needs?

560
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,372
He got a new phone and I
don't know what he's saying,

561
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,542
and I don't think he knows
how to answer our calls.

562
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,543
- Fine.

563
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,212
- [Jim] Thank you.

564
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,338
And why don't you
come downstairs

565
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,674
when you're done to help Jenn.

566
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,758
I heard that.

567
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,767
- Text Grandpa.

568
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,689
Hey, Grandpa. It's Chris.

569
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,525
(light plucky music)

570
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,402
Chris, your grandson.

571
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,443
Can you read this?

572
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,617
(light plucky music)
(texts chiming)

573
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,368
Oh my, shoot me.

574
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:50,374
(light plucky music)
(texts chiming)

575
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,591
(light plucky music)

576
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,890
(texts chiming)

577
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,812
(light plucky music)

578
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,280
(texts chiming)

579
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:32,291
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

580
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,966
(soft holiday music)

581
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,876
(sentimental holiday music)

582
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,812
(Chris sighs)

583
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,067
(sentimental holiday music)

584
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,371
- Go, go, go, go.

585
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,709
- Okay.

586
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,673
Do you think they'll like it?

587
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,092
- They're gonna be so impressed.

588
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,553
- Well, thank you.
(doorbell ringing)

589
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,389
Oh, god.
- For whom the bell tolls.

590
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,891
Who's first?

591
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,532
- I'll go see.
- No!

592
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,894
- No looking.

593
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,437
We made a game about it.

594
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,564
You have to guess who it is.

595
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,765
- I'm gonna say Grandpa.

596
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,936
- I'm gonna go Uncle Pat.

597
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,861
- Leigh.

598
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,448
- [Jim] What's the bet?

599
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,743
- 10 bucks.
- Deal.

600
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,119
- All right.

601
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,701
- [Jack] I'm rockin'!

602
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,751
- Ready?

603
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,088
- Hi.

604
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,631
- Tell me you're Leigh.

605
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,632
- Yeah.

606
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,760
- Ha! Cough it up, boys.

607
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,763
- I'm Jim, Chris's dad.

608
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,640
This is Jenn, my girlfriend.

609
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,808
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

610
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,976
- Can I take your jacket?

611
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,812
- Would you like a drink?

612
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,813
- [Leigh] Um.

613
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,106
- We have cheeses.

614
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,982
- No thank you. I'm okay.

615
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,485
Uh, can I help
you with anything?

616
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,486
- Oh, no.

617
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,567
- Just keep us calm.

618
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,119
(Chris sighs)

619
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,790
(soft introspective music)

620
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,460
- [Jack] I'm rockin'!

621
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,088
- Good for you, Jack!

622
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:32,972
- Merry Christmas.

623
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,013
- How are you?

624
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,054
Where's the kid?

625
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,480
You asked for it. (laughs)

626
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,023
- [Chris] Merry
Christmas, Grandpa.

627
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,650
- All right, get on with it.

628
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,694
Come on, man.

629
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,821
So, you must be Jenn.

630
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,656
Well, I'll tell you
somethin', the house looks-

631
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,616
- This is Jenn, Alf.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,826
Excuse me.

633
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,994
So you just be Jenn.
- Yes.

634
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,787
- Well, the house looks great.

635
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,539
And thank you for putting
this all together.

636
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,040
You know, Jim's an
attorney, but he couldn't,

637
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,878
he couldn't, he couldn't
organize his own briefs.

638
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,797
- Yeah, that's true.

639
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,842
- Anyway, so you, young
lady who's not Jenn,

640
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,218
what is your name?

641
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,053
- Leigh Cabot, Mr. Landon.

642
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,138
It's very nice to meet you.

643
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,723
- Nice to meet you.

644
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,849
- I've heard a lot about you.

645
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,810
- And you guys are, uh?

646
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,228
- Leigh's a friend of mine.

647
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,189
She works at the
shelter downtown.

648
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,649
- Friends.
- [Chris] Yeah.

649
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,236
- Okay. Well, when do we eat?

650
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,035
So, you're goin'
to college, huh?

651
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,703
Boy, you better be.

652
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,163
I sent you a hundred
bucks for graduation.

653
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,581
Then I couldn't figure
out how to log in

654
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,742
to watch the ceremony.

655
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,835
- I've been thinkin'
about art school.

656
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,546
Kinda. Sorta.

657
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,589
- Kinda sorta?

658
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,926
You wanna draw or somethin'?

659
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,219
- Graphic design.

660
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,721
Maybe.

661
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,934
It is the PA College
of Art and Design.

662
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,061
- Let me tell you
something, Chris.

663
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,687
The longer you wait,

664
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,008
the faster the sand runs
through the hourglass.

665
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,567
What about you, young lady?

666
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,736
- I'd love to one day, sir.

667
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,114
Right now I'm focusing
on starting a business.

668
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,783
- Starting your own business.

669
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,701
Now that's a good idea.

670
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,869
What's your passion?

671
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,205
- It's silly, but...

672
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,752
I love dogs, and I
wanna start dog walking

673
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,713
and doing dog sitting services.

674
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,049
I just need to
save up some money,

675
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,096
and I'm going to do this right.

676
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,977
But college is part
of the plan, too.

677
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,938
- Who needs it?
(doorbell ringing)

678
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,982
This oughta be fun.

679
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,608
- Okay, who's at the door?

680
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,776
- [James] I'm rockin'!

681
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,777
- It's Mandy and her brood.

682
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,858
Get ready to rumble.

683
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,116
(Jim sighs)

684
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,328
- [Mandy] Merry Christmas!
- My aunt and uncle are here.

685
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,788
- [Mandy] Oh, Daddy, oh my god!

686
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,914
- How are you?

687
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,791
- Hey, Jim. How's it goin'?

688
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,002
- Did Santa make an early
Xanax delivery to your house?

689
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,129
- Warm as a cry for
help, Dad, as always.

690
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,255
- He looks like the unabomber.

691
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,299
- Matt, Mandy, this is Jenn.

692
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,341
- [Mandy] Oh.
- Hi.

693
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,942
- [Mandy] Hi.
- Oh!

694
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,179
- Hey, man, what'd you do?

695
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,931
Get her in the mail from Russia?

696
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,143
Or one of those 90-day
television programs?

697
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,770
(light plucky music)

698
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,939
- [Mandy] Chris!

699
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,024
- [Chris] This is
my friend Leigh.

700
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,151
Uh, Leigh, that's my Aunt Mandy.

701
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,819
- [Mandy] Hi.
- [Leigh] Hi.

702
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,945
- [Matt] Hey, Chris.
How you doin', buddy?

703
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,226
- He never fails to disappoint.

704
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,330
(wreath clatters)

705
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,709
- Now she's your version
of a nerdy bookworm?

706
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,211
I don't wanna know where I rate.

707
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,009
- I guess a lot can
change in three years.

708
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,345
- Kelli.

709
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:07,686
- Hi.
- Oh my god.

710
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:08,687
- Hi.
- Hi!

711
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,855
- Where's Cole?

712
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,690
- He's still outside.

713
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,859
That dummy dropped the
presents all over the ground.

714
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,195
- That kid has been
on my shi-naughty list

715
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,696
for the last year.

716
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,740
You have no idea.

717
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,200
- Oh my god.

718
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,869
You look absolutely
stunning in that dress.

719
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,330
And your hair? Oh my god.

720
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,707
You are gorgeous. OMG.

721
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,917
I love you.

722
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,251
You are perfect.

723
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,252
You are!

724
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,091
- She speaks in
exclamation points.

725
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,717
- You did good, Uncle Jim.

726
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,344
- Oh!
- [Kelli] She is awesome.

727
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,346
- Hey, I think you've
been watching too much

728
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,015
of that TikTak or whatever
it is that dumb kids

729
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,016
watch on the internet.

730
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,894
- TikTok, Grandpa.

731
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,270
- CrepeCrap.

732
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,939
- Actually, I have
my own channel.

733
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,941
- She's been making good
money with endorsements.

734
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,901
She just might have a career.

735
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,903
- Well, make all the
money you can, kid,

736
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,224
'cause when your looks
are gone, you're done.

737
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,283
(light plucky music)

738
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,368
(doorbell ringing)

739
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,369
- Uncle Pat?

740
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,002
- Oh for god's
sake, it's the kid.

741
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,458
You want an engraved invitation?

742
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,460
Get in here.

743
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,923
- Hi, Grandpa. Merry Christmas.

744
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,133
- Yeah, I got more
gifts in the car

745
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,051
when you put these away.

746
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,051
Come on.

747
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,434
(ornament jingling)

748
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,812
- [Jack] I'm rockin'!

749
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,231
- Whoa! Everybody
hold the phones.

750
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,442
I got to know what is goin' on

751
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,445
with the goofball next door
sittin' on the front porch

752
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,822
rockin' in a rockin' chair.

753
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,909
- Hello, pot. I'm
kettle. You're black.

754
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,787
(Matt chuckles)

755
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,998
- Oh, that's just Jack
next door, Uncle Matt.

756
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,833
He likes to rock in his chair.

757
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,835
I could only wish to
be as happy as him.

758
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,961
He's nice.

759
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,282
- Well, he looks like a martian.

760
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,925
Hey, Jim, what you say you
let me walk around the house

761
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,926
a little bit and
scope the place out?

762
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:06,971
- Be my guest.

763
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,308
- I am your guest, Jim.

764
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,476
I mean, what do
you mean by that?

765
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,797
What are you trying to say here?

766
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,106
- Nothin'. Just
means go ahead, Matt.

767
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,941
- Mmm-hmm.

768
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,982
Yeah, it all looks
under control here.

769
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,157
(light plucky music)

770
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,502
- (sighs) He wants to make
sure the house isn't bugged.

771
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,172
- Well, I guess you shouldn't
show him these, huh?

772
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,342
- (gasps) OMG!

773
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,844
Digi sunglasses?

774
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,222
I want those.

775
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,225
Like, you don't understand.

776
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,980
- All right, well, I
better get dinner started.

777
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,066
- Uh, can I help?

778
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,150
- Sure.

779
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,269
- [Kelli] I'm coming, too.

780
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,744
- Don't forget
Grandpa's presents.

781
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,541
- It's been a long lockdown.

782
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,583
- You have no idea.

783
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:25,551
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

784
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,598
- Oh! (head thuds)

785
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,060
(Jim sighs)

786
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,230
(phone vibrating)

787
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,900
(text chiming)

788
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,617
(text chiming)

789
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,578
- You should be a
guest on my show.

790
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,079
Jenn?
- [Jenn] Mmm. Mmm-hmm?

791
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,914
- My god, I would love that.

792
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,374
You could make some big money.

793
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,458
- Wow.

794
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,127
- And you.

795
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,421
I want you to glow
up on my channel.

796
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,965
I get like all these
products for free.

797
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,134
We do this awesome
before and after,

798
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,303
and then your glow up
blows up my channel.

799
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,432
- Um, is there a problem
with the way that I look now?

800
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,225
- It's a compliment.

801
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,104
She's saying you have potential.

802
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,441
(glasses chiming)

803
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,151
- Okay.

804
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,570
- Honestly, Jenn, you should've
just had this catered.

805
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,405
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

806
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,990
I didn't want to have people
work on Christmas Eve.

807
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,911
- Oh, please, they
chose the job.

808
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,287
Are you making
homemade applesauce?

809
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,165
- Yeah, just an
online recipe I found.

810
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,627
- Oh, Amy used to
love to make that.

811
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,963
She had this big family cookbook

812
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,341
filled with her
favorite recipes.

813
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,968
It's gotta be here somewhere.

814
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,971
- Um, Mandy?

815
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,097
I lied.

816
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:03,440
(soft sentimental
music) (glasses chiming)

817
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,446
- Kelli, stop with
those stupid sunglasses

818
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,647
and help your Aunt Jenn,

819
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,368
help Jenn with this applesauce.

820
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,455
(soft sentimental music)

821
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,376
- Um, okay. Well, the
apples need to be mashed.

822
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,057
There you go.
- Okay.

823
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,218
(masher tapping)

824
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,346
- You can cook?

825
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,140
- Uh, a little bit, yeah.

826
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,558
(masher tapping)

827
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,726
- Oh, no, no, no.
The cooked apples.

828
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,688
Mash the cooked apples, please.

829
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,649
(water boiling)

830
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,025
- I can't get anything
on this dress.

831
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,026
- Here. I got you.

832
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,237
It's just water. Okay.

833
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,701
- So what's new, Cole?

834
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,245
I mean, besides the obvious.

835
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,580
- Could be better, Grandpa.

836
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,542
- Um, what happened with Kelli?

837
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,044
- Yeah, that's an
extreme makeover.

838
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,214
Matt, you should
get one of those.

839
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,427
- Now what exactly you
tryin' to say by that, Alf?

840
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,679
- I'm not tryin', I'm sayin' it.

841
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,558
The pandemic was a virus,
not early onset dementia.

842
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,768
- It's a long story.

843
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,229
I don't really want to
talk about right now.

844
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,150
- [Alf] Don't worry.
Your mom will.

845
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,442
(doorbell ringing)

846
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,443
- Funcle Pat?

847
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,278
Thank god!

848
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,572
- Here's Pat!

849
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,700
(waning happy music)

850
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,285
Jesus, Pat.

851
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,786
You look like all
the side effects

852
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,705
for a medicine commercial.

853
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,124
- I'm really looking forward
to Catch Match Christmas, so.

854
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,542
- [Jack] I'm rockin'!

855
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,463
- Good for you,
Jack! Good for you!

856
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,133
Well, I'm gonna get
a drink and potty.

857
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,220
- Merry Christmas,
little brother.

858
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,221
- Hey.

859
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:04,268
It's, uh, it's been a long time.

860
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,645
- Uh, this is
Jenn, in the flesh.

861
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,272
- [Jenn] Hi.

862
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,441
- We've been going
back and forth

863
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,567
through electronic mail.

864
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,651
It's good to finally meet you.

865
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,445
- Good to meet you as well.

866
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,766
I've heard a lot of good things.

867
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,491
- Okay.

868
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,499
- Well, how is life
treating you, Pat?

869
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,293
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh.

870
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,669
Uh.

871
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,801
Uh, well, actually if
you really wanna know,

872
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,137
um, yeah,

873
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,348
Laurie and I are done.

874
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,642
Uh, we broke up for
good this summer.

875
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,643
So, ah.

876
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,772
I lost my job.

877
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,149
I can't find a new one.

878
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,655
I'm, uh, six months
behind on rent,

879
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,324
and my car is about to die,

880
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,325
and I

881
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,703
have a boil

882
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,704
on my butt

883
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,209
that needs to be lanced.

884
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,171
I think it's infected.

885
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,175
(Leigh chuckles)

886
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,719
- Merry Christmas, Funcle Pat.

887
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,888
- Chris!

888
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,515
Yeah, Funcle Pat.

889
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,516
Yeah, yeah.
- [Chris] Funcle Pat, yeah.

890
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,184
- It's good to see you.

891
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,894
- Uh, this is my friend Leigh.

892
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,230
- Don't screw him over.

893
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,685
- I get you, Uncle Pat.

894
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,861
I get you.

895
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,240
(fist pounding)
- [Matt] Who is it?

896
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,575
- What a weird thing to ask.

897
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,660
Hurry up in there!

898
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,578
You alone out here?

899
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,207
- No.

900
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,208
They're watching.

901
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,837
- They? They who?

902
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,672
- Them.

903
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,926
- What do they want?

904
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,429
- You know what they want.

905
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,389
- I wouldn't know
where to start, Alf.

906
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,558
There is so much
weird stuff happenin'

907
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,560
in this world these days.

908
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,601
- You don't say?

909
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,439
- The pandemic.

910
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,567
That was all one
big distraction.

911
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,777
- A distraction from what?

912
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,863
- Aliens.

913
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,698
- Oh, lizard people.

914
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,949
- Mmm-mmm.

915
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,784
Mmm.

916
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,784
The grays.

917
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,789
From the far away land
of Zeida Reticuli.

918
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,791
- Don't worry, Jack.

919
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:33,919
Dad's got your back.

920
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,423
- Matt.

921
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,799
Matt, Alf.

922
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,120
You don't even know your
own son-in-law's name.

923
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,802
- They're watching.

924
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,601
- Who are you?

925
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,437
- I'm just a man that
needs to pee, Jack.

926
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,273
A man that really needs to pee.

927
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,650
- [Matt] Mmm-hmm.

928
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,741
- I should've done
a background check

929
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,285
when Mandy brought him home.

930
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,788
Oh, I got to pee.

931
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,332
- Hi, guys.

932
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm here with my fam
making homemade applesauce.

933
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,835
It's like a famous
family recipe.

934
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,506
And OMG, it's like low-key,
the best thing ever.

935
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,800
You're so jealous
right now, I know.

936
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,843
Merry Christmas!

937
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,514
- Look at her go.

938
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,766
Beauty and brains.

939
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,476
- [Jenn] Oh, yeah.

940
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,354
- I'm so proud of you!

941
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,650
(light plucky music)

942
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,873
(tense dramatic music)

943
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:55,874
- Phew.

944
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,519
(soft sentimental music)

945
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,039
(glasses chiming)

946
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,707
You are working so hard.

947
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,875
Take a load off.

948
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,376
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

949
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,086
This has to be perfect.

950
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,407
- You have a lot to learn
about this family, honey.

951
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,090
- [Matt] Alf! Hey!

952
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,425
- [Funcle Pat] What the?

953
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,844
- Matthew!

954
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:53,098
- [Funcle Pat] What, uh, what
exactly are you looking for?

955
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,933
- [Matt] Hmm.

956
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,894
- He's checking to see if
your pupils react to the light

957
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,729
and turn long like a reptile's.

958
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,897
- Seriously?

959
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,898
- I am serious.

960
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,860
Unfortunately, so is he.

961
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,448
- Oh, for god's sake, Matthew!

962
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,116
They're not lizard people.

963
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,952
- Pretty bad when she's
the voice of reason.

964
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,788
- Cole, Matthew.

965
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,123
Family meeting right now.

966
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,918
- What did I do this time?

967
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:24,631
- [Matt] Hmm.

968
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,469
(Funcle Pat swallows)

969
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,555
- Well, um, I'm gonna go

970
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,766
anywhere else.

971
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:36,767
- I'll come, too.

972
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,649
(Jim exhaling)

973
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,154
- I never knew ginger ale could
be used as a cooking hack.

974
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,155
- Oh, yeah.

975
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,490
- Aw, give me a break.

976
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,075
- What?
- Not you.

977
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,618
Glasses?

978
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,161
- One sec.
- [Chris] Really?

979
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,789
- One sec.

980
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,839
Ew. Reality is gross.

981
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,633
- Jenn, can we help
you with anything?

982
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,510
- Sure, um.

983
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,096
Can you start bringing things
out to the table, please?

984
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,097
- Okay.

985
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,517
- Thank you.

986
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,989
- It's really tough coming
back here with Amy gone.

987
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,618
There should've been a service.

988
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,862
We should've been there.

989
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,001
- Yeah, well, the
pandemic had other plans.

990
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,837
You need another drink?

991
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,549
I'm gonna.

992
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,177
- Uh.

993
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,055
Jenn's a,

994
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,851
a real pretty girl.

995
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,519
Nice work.

996
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,889
- I know what you think.

997
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,693
- Nah, I don't think you do.

998
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,070
- I have a hunch.

999
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,533
- Okay, look, we've
always been straight

1000
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,577
with one another.

1001
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,912
You know me.

1002
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,039
One word.

1003
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,583
- Go for it.

1004
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,584
- Biology.

1005
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,714
- [Jim] Huh?

1006
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,715
- Biology.

1007
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,760
All right, Jenn's what?

1008
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,847
She's, uh, 25?
Somethin' like that?

1009
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,098
- Somethin' like that.

1010
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,099
- So...

1011
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,064
What are you doing? (chuckles)

1012
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,941
Come on.

1013
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,235
You're supposed to be the
smart, successful son.

1014
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,070
- Don't start that.
- Oh, come on.

1015
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,863
You know Mom loved
you more than me.

1016
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,033
You're the firstborn.

1017
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,244
I read. I know how stuff works.

1018
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,287
- How what works?

1019
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,872
- Oh, man.

1020
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,960
Does, does Jenn want kids?

1021
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,628
Do you know?

1022
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,297
Are you going to be
changing the diaper

1023
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,802
of your second-favorite
child when you're 60?

1024
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,970
- I don't know.

1025
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,808
- What about Chris? Huh?

1026
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,811
Have you thought about that?

1027
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,312
What about your wife?

1028
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,648
- Amy?
- Amy, yeah.

1029
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,276
Yeah, she, uh.

1030
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,987
She died, man.

1031
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:35,989
That's...

1032
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,324
Just messed up.

1033
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,666
- Yeah, well cancer
will do that.

1034
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,662
- It's just, I...

1035
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:50,628
I don't understand how
you're always so okay.

1036
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,673
- My life's a mess.

1037
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,010
It's not, it's not fair.

1038
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,137
You know, I just,

1039
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,141
I look at you and no matter
what gets thrown your way,

1040
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,769
you always seem to
land on your feet.

1041
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,854
- You don't know the
first thing about

1042
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,015
what I've been through.

1043
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,110
I'm just doing the best I
can with the one life I have.

1044
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,987
So you decided to
throw yours away,

1045
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,269
it doesn't obligate the
rest of us to follow suit.

1046
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,826
- Hey, Funcle Pat.

1047
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,828
I was just tellin' Leigh here.

1048
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,288
Um, do you remember
when you drug us

1049
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,956
across the backyard
in the snowmobile?

1050
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,333
Like you tied the
kiddie pool to it

1051
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,667
and Mom was really mad?
(Funcle Pat laughs)

1052
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,003
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,132
I had to sell that snowmobile
to pay for groceries.

1054
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,051
- Okay.

1055
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,011
(Mandy clears throat)

1056
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,389
- Jim, you're owed
two apologies.

1057
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,350
The first one from my
husband for calling

1058
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,060
you all lizard people.

1059
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,728
And the second one, from Cole.

1060
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,063
- Hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

1061
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,898
- [Mandy] Cole?

1062
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,358
- I don't know why I'm
supposed to be apologizing.

1063
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,068
- For being a little
snarky- - It's fine.

1064
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,069
It's good.

1065
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,364
We're all happy you're here.

1066
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,909
- Let me ask you somethin'.

1067
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,950
Do you love her?

1068
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,871
- No, we're just friends.

1069
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,416
- Well then there can only
be one explanation for this.

1070
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,086
Now I get it.

1071
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,213
There's 147 reasons you
don't want Jenn and your Dad

1072
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:20,342
to, you know, and
between us, I'm with ya.

1073
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,103
- I'm not- - Shut up.

1074
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,389
- When your grandma died,

1075
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,224
I thought I'd never
be happy again,

1076
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,105
and for a long
time that was true.

1077
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,896
But then eventually
you start to heal.

1078
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,942
And if you're very lucky,
happiness will find you.

1079
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,320
- He's not happy.
He's delusional.

1080
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,405
- If there's a difference
between the two,

1081
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,446
I've never seen it.

1082
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,912
(hand smacks)

1083
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,918
- Hey! (hand smacks)

1084
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,880
(soft gentle music)

1085
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,518
- [Jenn] Oh, really?

1086
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,317
(glasses whirring)

1087
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,071
(chime ringing)

1088
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:34,167
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

1089
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,338
- Ah, wanna thank everyone
for making the venture out

1090
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,842
for the first family
gathering in over three years.

1091
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,011
Jenn and I are blessed
by your presence.

1092
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,971
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1093
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:51,016
Oh, and um, I would like
to say something as well.

1094
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,186
A toast to Amy.

1095
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,105
It's her recipes, her kitchen.

1096
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,260
Without her, none of this
would've been possible, so.

1097
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,526
To Amy.

1098
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,527
- To Amy.

1099
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,282
(glasses clinking)

1100
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,245
- Time for food.

1101
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,506
(utensils clinking)

1102
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,518
(soft suspenseful music)

1103
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,520
(Cole gags)

1104
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,480
(Alf coughs)

1105
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,314
- [Mandy] Dad!

1106
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,358
- Jenn, did you wood
chip the Morton salt girl

1107
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,526
and sprinkle her in here?

1108
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,986
- It's like seawater.

1109
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,363
- I, I didn't.

1110
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,198
Kelli made the sauce.

1111
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,075
- Don't blame her for
your lack of supervision.

1112
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,869
- You did this on purpose for
one of your stupid videos.

1113
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,412
- What? No I did not!

1114
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,873
- Not everything is
a conspiracy, Cole.

1115
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,251
- Lizard people thinks there
isn't a conspiracy here?

1116
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,877
- I'm sure it was
just a simple mistake.

1117
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,045
I didn't mean anything.
(water bubbling)

1118
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,380
- My daughter's an angel.

1119
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,382
She would never
disrespect Amy's recipe!

1120
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,050
- Do you really
think I would try

1121
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,219
and ruin Christmas with a prank?

1122
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,054
- This is my nightmare.
- [Kelli] I'm not Grandpa!

1123
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,514
- Oh, come on.

1124
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,099
You're already dumb. You
don't have to act it.

1125
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,559
- Oh, she's the
one who's typical?

1126
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,395
Really? You really
wanna go there?

1127
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,938
(spoon clanging)
- Jim!

1128
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,099
Enough with the glass.

1129
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,073
(suspenseful plucky music)

1130
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,368
- I know I heard
somethin' up here.

1131
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,369
Somethin'.

1132
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,917
We got us a whole
lotta maybe somethin'.

1133
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,253
(water bubbling)

1134
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,922
Oop! Wait a minute!

1135
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,301
- Yeah.

1136
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,137
- Excuse me?

1137
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,471
- Yeah.

1138
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,098
I wanna go there.

1139
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,600
You all wanna know
why they're mad at me?

1140
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,476
- Cole, don't you dare!

1141
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,395
Just shut up and drop it!

1142
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,106
- Why don't you take
your own advice, Mom.

1143
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,941
I'll tell you all why.

1144
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:08,153
Last summer me and my
girlfriend, we got serious.

1145
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,613
(Mandy gasps)

1146
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,448
- Serious? How serious?

1147
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,452
- About as serious as
you can get, Uncle Jim.

1148
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,664
- Cole, this is not
dinner conversation.

1149
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,958
It's Christmas!
- Mandy, head it!

1150
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,002
I wanna hear the kid.

1151
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,171
Pass the bread, Leigh.

1152
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,509
(water bubbling)

1153
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,512
- Yeah, that'll work.

1154
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,641
- You wanna know what they did?

1155
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,976
Oh, my dear mom
got so freaked out

1156
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:44,314
that she and Dad made me
move school districts.

1157
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,483
- You guys moved?
- No.

1158
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,651
That's just it.

1159
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,527
They lied to the new school.

1160
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,363
Said they were divorced,

1161
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,658
and then Dad used his brother's
trailer as a residence.

1162
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,659
- That's illegal.

1163
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,701
- [Cole] Ya think?

1164
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,536
- That's awful.
- Right?

1165
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,164
You're not even in the
family and you get it.

1166
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,041
- I get you, Cole.

1167
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,001
I really get ya.

1168
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,337
- Took me out of my school
where all my friends were

1169
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,674
for my senior year.

1170
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,719
I lost my friends, I
lost my girlfriend.

1171
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,223
I hate everything.

1172
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,390
- Yeah, I got one.

1173
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,560
Ugh.

1174
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,020
Man.

1175
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,021
Ah! Oh!

1176
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,690
Ah!

1177
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,194
- Mandy.

1178
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,029
- He's exaggerating, Jim.

1179
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,572
It wasn't like that.

1180
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:36,491
- It wasn't?

1181
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,535
I had to take a bus to Uncle
Walt's trailer every day

1182
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,776
and one of those two
would come pick me up.

1183
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,708
- That's major fraud, tax fraud.

1184
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,085
Don't you think your reaction
was a little extreme?

1185
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,712
- Extreme? Really, Jim?

1186
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,755
He was 16.

1187
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,716
- It's not like he
committed some crime,

1188
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,837
but you two might of.

1189
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,179
- It figures you
would side with him.

1190
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,220
- [Jim] Huh, what
do you mean by that?

1191
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,045
- Well, she's referencing, uh.

1192
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,770
- [Jim] I know what
she's referencing.

1193
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,439
- None of you know
how hard it's been

1194
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,233
for me these last three years.

1195
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,614
- Where I thought
I'd find the problem.

1196
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:17,741
(water gurgling)

1197
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,201
Got myself into a problem.

1198
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,202
Oh! Oh!

1199
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,121
Oof!

1200
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,122
Ah!

1201
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,124
- Dogs are better than people.

1202
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,417
- Mmm.

1203
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,586
You need to meet Leni then.

1204
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,212
- [Cole] Who's Leni?

1205
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,298
- Oh, a dog that I
watch at the shelter.

1206
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,466
- Mmm, yeah.

1207
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,551
What? Are we holdin' ya up?

1208
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,429
Please continue. We're all ears.

1209
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,264
- Well.

1210
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,642
(Matt grunting)

1211
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,311
I'm gonna end up having
to leave out of here

1212
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,146
with the whole toilet
bowl attached to me.

1213
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,483
Uh! (water gurgles)

1214
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,819
- Why can't you be
more like your sister?

1215
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,654
- You serious?

1216
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,656
At least my girlfriend
wasn't like 50 years old.

1217
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,617
(Mandy gasps)

1218
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:04,287
Mom, she tells you that her
money comes from endorsements,

1219
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,830
but really her boyfriend,

1220
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,334
her 50-year-old
married boyfriend

1221
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,503
is sending her money.

1222
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,463
- He's lying.

1223
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,131
None of this is true!

1224
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:17,133
He's just trying to
draw attention away

1225
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,593
from his screw ups.

1226
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,512
- Well let me see
your phone then.

1227
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:20,804
- No.

1228
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,180
- Kelli? (sobbing)

1229
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,640
- Mommy.

1230
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,641
Mommy!

1231
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,442
- Well, don't want
it to go to waste.

1232
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,865
- Maybe before I go home I
could stop over and meet Leni.

1233
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,700
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1234
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,454
- Uh, uh, would you,
would you wanna walk him?

1235
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,704
- I think I would.

1236
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,334
- Well, can't get any worse.

1237
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,462
Wow.

1238
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,713
Just wow.

1239
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:56,840
I'm so sorry.

1240
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,716
- Oh, don't be.

1241
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:02,388
Chris warned me that things
could go south today.

1242
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,196
It's fine.
- Yeah.

1243
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:09,894
I forced everybody together.

1244
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:13,314
I thought it was
gonna be a good thing.

1245
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,567
And turns out it's not.

1246
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:18,903
- Don't say that.

1247
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:21,573
I mean, so yeah, I mean,

1248
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,701
the applesauce was a mess,

1249
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,538
but that's not the
end of the world.

1250
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,418
And you did such a good job
getting everyone together.

1251
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:37,882
I mean, family is so important.

1252
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:41,718
- Yeah.

1253
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,763
Should've spent the
night with your family.

1254
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,515
Bet they're totally normal.

1255
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,851
- [Leigh] Well.
(lights clicking)

1256
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,729
- [Funcle Pat] Hey, I
think the power's out.

1257
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,398
- Perfect time for the
Christmas Cage Match.

1258
01:09:55,399 --> 01:10:00,404
(dogs yelping)
(gentle piano music)

1259
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:10,623
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

1260
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:17,295
Okay, so we all know the
rules, but for newcomers,

1261
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,964
the gifts are put into that box.

1262
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:24,970
First player gets a gift
out of that box, opens it.

1263
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,972
Second player can
either steal that gift

1264
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:31,476
or get another gift
out of the box.

1265
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,645
And there are some
clunkers in there,

1266
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,981
but as always,
there's some treasure.

1267
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,318
2,000 big ones.

1268
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,786
- [Leigh] So it's
like White Elephant?

1269
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,793
- We call it
Christmas Cage Match.

1270
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:57,794
- Why is that?

1271
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,339
- You'll see.

1272
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,968
- Okay, who's the first player?

1273
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:09,431
(tense dramatic music)

1274
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:21,485
(gifts clattering)
(bright holiday music)

1275
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,372
- Where?

1276
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,791
I saw it!

1277
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,671
(gifts clattering)

1278
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,636
(Pat mumbling)

1279
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,640
(gifts clattering)

1280
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,395
(bright holiday music)

1281
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,696
Okay.

1282
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,673
(soft gentle music)

1283
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,900
(paper ripping)

1284
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:48,739
- Thanks, Grandpa.

1285
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,743
(soft gentle music)

1286
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,621
- No. Why?

1287
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:57,955
- Pull it together, soldier.

1288
01:12:57,956 --> 01:12:59,750
You still got a war to fight!

1289
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:01,876
- Please.

1290
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,702
- [Funcle Pat] Can't your
husband buy you alcohol?

1291
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:11,428
- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- [Cole] Oh, come on.

1292
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,141
- Ew! What is that?

1293
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:21,438
(gentle piano music)

1294
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,990
(paper ripping)

1295
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,618
- Oh, look at this.

1296
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:40,624
You shouldn't have. (laughs)

1297
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,502
Huh.

1298
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,463
It sees you while
you're sleeping.

1299
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,885
- That's just,
that's so last year.

1300
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,510
- Did Kelli get two gifts?

1301
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,805
- I, just don't worry about it.

1302
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,767
- It's my turn now, right?

1303
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,478
Hmm. Oh.

1304
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,147
- No!
- Oh, I don't think so!

1305
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,690
This was her gift.

1306
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:06,691
You may take this.

1307
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:07,859
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1308
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,485
- [Mandy] Don't shush me!

1309
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:10,653
- I'm not interested
in what you think!

1310
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:11,821
You're not playing by the rules!

1311
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:12,822
- [Kelli] I don't care!

1312
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:13,990
- You're not playing!

1313
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,700
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!

1314
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:19,036
(siblings screaming)

1315
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,955
The money's mine!

1316
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:24,542
- Most traditions are
lame, but this one just,

1317
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,836
this one's worth holdin' onto.

1318
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:30,674
(group yelling indistinctly)

1319
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:41,017
(Funcle Pat screaming)

1320
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,144
- Ah, he bit me!
- Are you okay?

1321
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,645
- He assaulted me!

1322
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,730
Hush, my dear

1323
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,690
Hold your peers

1324
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:51,903
Be here in this warm embrace

1325
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,530
Heed my words

1326
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:56,657
Hear this song

1327
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,703
Let my love make you strong

1328
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:04,916
There's no need for
this heartache tonight

1329
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:09,754
There's no reason to
shut out the light

1330
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:14,008
There's no need for
us to argue and fight

1331
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:17,053
'Cause we are together

1332
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:22,059
And baby it's Christmas tonight

1333
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,104
Oh

1334
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:32,110
It's Christmas tonight

1335
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,280
Oh

1336
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,785
It's Christmas tonight

1337
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:49,086
(glasses vibrating)
(bright jangly music)

1338
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,132
With everyone fighting
over White Elephant,

1339
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:59,303
I realized that no one
wants to talk about

1340
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,098
the elephant in the room.

1341
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,308
(gentle piano music)

1342
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,936
I didn't know Amy,

1343
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,982
but I feel like I do.

1344
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,653
She's everywhere in this house.

1345
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,909
And though I've only see
one picture of her, I,

1346
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,622
I can't help but think that

1347
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,668
she would've been the
mom that I always wanted.

1348
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,298
(gentle piano music)

1349
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,136
I don't have a family.

1350
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,641
I sleep on a mattress
in a basement

1351
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:51,023
off of the charity of people
that I pretend are my friends.

1352
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:58,697
I would love to have a
family like all of you.

1353
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,994
I would love to have
a mother like Amy

1354
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,162
or Mandy

1355
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,207
or Jenn.

1356
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,338
(gentle piano music)

1357
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:16,214
You're angry,

1358
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:20,051
and I get it.

1359
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,844
I'm angry, too.

1360
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,014
Not for the same
reasons, but it's,

1361
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,684
it's Christmas,

1362
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:34,232
and we're all pretty lucky
to be here together, tonight.

1363
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,820
Chris.

1364
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,866
She was your mom.

1365
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:47,245
I can't imagine what
it must've been like

1366
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,999
not being able to
say goodbye to her.

1367
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:54,753
- I, I miss her every day.

1368
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,424
(gentle piano music)

1369
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:09,851
She was your daughter.

1370
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,107
That's not how it's
supposed to happen.

1371
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:21,029
A parent should never
have to lose their child.

1372
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,951
(gentle piano music)

1373
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,456
She was your sister.

1374
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,918
I would be mad, too.

1375
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,422
You loved her.

1376
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,221
She was your wife.

1377
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,141
The mother of your son.

1378
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,061
I'm so sorry, Mr. Marsh.

1379
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:57,107
(gentle piano music)

1380
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:01,278
I'm so sorry you lost her.

1381
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,450
None of you

1382
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,747
got the closure
that you deserve.

1383
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:16,418
The pandemic robbed
all of you of that.

1384
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,966
It stole something
from all of us.

1385
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:29,306
Something much more
important than a wad of money

1386
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,808
in a pile of gifts.

1387
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:36,313
(gentle piano music)

1388
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,858
You were owed better,

1389
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,361
and so was Amy.

1390
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:47,866
Maybe it's time
to steal it back.

1391
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:52,287
(gentle piano music)

1392
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,016
- When my girls were little,

1393
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,937
I could protect
them from anything.

1394
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,147
When Amy needed me the most,

1395
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,192
I couldn't protect her.

1396
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,529
I couldn't even
be there for her.

1397
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,864
I couldn't hold her hand.

1398
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,868
(Alf exhales)

1399
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,872
I couldn't even tell
her I loved her.

1400
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,001
I miss her every day.

1401
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:44,506
I know you do, too.
I know we all do.

1402
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,336
I love you, too, Mandy.

1403
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:53,557
I don't tell ya
enough, but I love you.

1404
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,019
(gentle piano music)

1405
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:17,205
(gentle piano music continues)

1406
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:39,311
- Amy was everything to me.

1407
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,064
We met in college and
I fell in love with her

1408
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,232
the moment I cheated off of her

1409
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,985
for our political science exam.

1410
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,449
I remember when Chris was born,

1411
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,951
when they handed him to her.

1412
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,246
I knew in that moment that
she was put on this earth

1413
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,367
to be that kid's mom.

1414
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:06,253
When he turned one
she wrote a poem

1415
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,132
for his first birthday and
had it published in the paper.

1416
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,261
She wasn't Emily Dickinson, but.

1417
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,637
You remember it?

1418
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,603
"Our son is one today.

1419
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,608
He is my life, my
world, come what may.

1420
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,529
I will watch him grow

1421
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:37,535
and listen to every
word he'll say. (crying)

1422
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,706
One day he'll become
a man and go away,

1423
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:47,504
but for now our son is
one today." (sniffling)

1424
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:52,717
Hardest closing argument ever.

1425
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,223
(soft gentle music)

1426
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:15,657
(soft gentle music continues)

1427
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:25,709
Jenn.

1428
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,411
You've done nothing but
show respect to Amy.

1429
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,093
We're all here because of you.

1430
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,387
None of this would be possible

1431
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:42,100
without your amazing,
caring, loving heart.

1432
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,061
You deserve a lot more attention

1433
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:47,382
than what you've been getting.

1434
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:55,112
Hasn't been easy,
and I know that.

1435
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,113
I'm sorry.

1436
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:01,285
But I'm in awe of your
strength and courage,

1437
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:05,372
and you brought
happiness into my world

1438
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,333
when I didn't think
it was possible.

1439
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,630
Jenn.

1440
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:23,599
I lost the ring, so use
your imagination, but.

1441
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,600
- My god, Jim.

1442
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:28,103
- Wait.

1443
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:32,150
(soft gentle music)

1444
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:39,783
(Jim chuckles softly)

1445
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:48,665
(Jenn chuckles softly)

1446
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:49,706
- What do you say?

1447
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:52,461
- Uh.

1448
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:55,506
Uh, no.

1449
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,427
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1450
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,473
Jim, I love you.

1451
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,435
But, um, not now.

1452
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,146
And maybe not ever,

1453
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:12,816
but, uh, that's okay.

1454
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:18,655
I mean, this family
obviously needs to grieve,

1455
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,199
and you all deserve that.

1456
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,662
(gentle piano music)

1457
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:29,164
And I'll never replace Amy.

1458
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:32,877
We need to know if that's
what's been going on here.

1459
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,216
And I'm not your mom, I know.

1460
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:43,178
But I also know that
she would be very proud

1461
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:45,181
of the man you're
growing up to be.

1462
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,561
I'm sorry.

1463
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:55,859
I love you, Jim.

1464
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:00,196
(soft gentle music)

1465
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,203
- Here.

1466
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:10,164
Use that to get
back on your feet.

1467
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,333
- Okay. Shh.

1468
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,334
- Okay.

1469
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,381
- What would you think
if I adopted Leni?

1470
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,425
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1471
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,718
- I haven't had a
date in 20 years,

1472
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,845
and dogs are chick magnets.

1473
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,430
You always see all
these single ladies

1474
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,390
at the dog park, and if
they see me with Leni,

1475
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:29,558
they're gonna think, oh my gosh,

1476
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:30,934
I guess he's not terrible.

1477
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,895
- I mean, I would love that.

1478
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,773
I'd miss him a little bit,
but he'd be in a good home.

1479
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,609
- Well, you'd still
see him 'cause I need

1480
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,527
a dog sitter once in awhile.

1481
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:41,945
- Right.

1482
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,946
I haven't started
my business up yet.

1483
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,700
- Well, I could
be your investor.

1484
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,911
I can help you get
it up and running.

1485
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,456
- I, I can't accept that.

1486
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,750
- You know, my late
wife used to say

1487
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,460
if someone gives
you a wonderful gift

1488
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,422
and you're embarrassed,
just say thank you.

1489
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,557
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1490
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:08,263
- [Jack] Merry Christmas!

1491
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:11,475
- So, uh, what'd I miss?

1492
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,644
(bright holiday music)

1493
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,730
- [Jack] Merry Christmas!

1494
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,734
- Merry Christmas, Jack!

1495
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,486
Merry Christmas!

1496
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:25,657
(bright holiday music)

1497
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,830
(glasses vibrating)

1498
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,919
(bright holiday music)

1499
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:00,024
(heartwarming holiday music)

1500
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:22,547
(bright holiday music)

1501
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:52,869
(bright holiday music continues)

1502
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:16,100
(bright holiday music continues)
