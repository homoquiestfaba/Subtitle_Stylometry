Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,084
We got the building coming down!

3
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,152
Everybody move it out!

00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,389
Everybody out! Let's go!

00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,390
Move it out!

7
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,393

Let's go, folks! Move it out!

00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:06,300
Move it out!

10
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,837
Outside! Get those boxes out!

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,172
This building's coming down!

12
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,006
We got to move! Come on now!

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,611
Let's go, folks! Move it out!

14
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,818
Bobby...

15
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,291
Come back over here.

16
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,259
This here's the story
of that little black boy

17
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:41,762
who go into the jungle...
What's his name?

19
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,930
Sambo.

20
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,432
Little black Sambo,

21
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,934
only not particularly black,
nor he white,

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,570
'cause this not the story
you're accustomed to,

23
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,504
understand?

24
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,506
This here the honest to god,

25
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:56,510
up to date,
unexpurgated version.

26
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,079
Now, Sambo,
he go into the jungle

27
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,881
wearing this brand new
red jacket

28
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:04,318
and his brand new
blue pants and purple shoes,

29
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,354
and he carrying his
brand new green umbrella

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,090
to protect himself
from the fierce jungle sun.

31
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,359
And one by one,

32
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,793
them tigers come and steal away

33
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,162
each of them
various items of clothing

34
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,797
until Sambo,
he got nothing left.

35
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,603
Then they begin to fighting
amongst themselves

36
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,406
to see who is the grandest
tiger of them all.

37
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,609
Now, this here
where the story diverts,

38
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,986
'cause Sambo, he not interested

39
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,080
in putting back on
any of them clothes

40
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,146
the tigers threw off.

41
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,816
No, siree.

42
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,620
This Sambo, he walked out
of that jungle 100% naked.

43
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:43,324
But he got something
even more precious

44
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,394
than that red jacket
and them blue pants

45
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,296
and his purple shoes.

46
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,334
What he got is
his own naked self,

47
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,636
and no one, no way,

48
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,972
going to take that
away from him.

49
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,641
That's my story.

50
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,819
Shine you up real fine, my man.

51
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,389
This window going to be positively
radiant 'fore I'm through.

52
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,093
Yeah, it makes my heart
jump for joy

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,395
to see such radiance.

54
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,896
What about you, mister?

55
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,899
Your little heart going
pitty-pat, pitty-pat?

56
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,503

whatsoever, my man...

57
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,039
But we do accept gratuities.

58
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,344
Thank you kindly.

59
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,601
Is that your baby?

60
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,045
Is he yours?

61
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,048
Yeah, he mine, only he not a he.

62
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,417
It's a she.

63
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,918
I'll hold her.

64
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,660

a bus for Roberto clemente...

67
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,932

Thank you.

69
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:48,948
Watch yourself.

70
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,776
This say Gloria wise
and two children.

71
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,978
You a member of the family?

72
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,480
No. I'm a friend.

73
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,550
You're in the wrong place.
This is a family shelter.

74
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,553
You got to go back downtown to ft.
Washington.

75
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,159
I heard that!

76
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,028
That look like my blanket.

77
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,689
What the hell you do, boy?

78
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,058
Hey, you take my picture?

79
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,560
Yeah.

80
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,861
You got no common sense,

81
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,896
tuning in on a man like that?

82
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,131
I ain't no fly
on no fucking wall!

83
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,533
My image ain't for sale!

84
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Let me have it!

85
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,802
What, what, what?

86
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:22,970
That film!

87
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,505
There's no film.
There's no film.

88
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,007
Hand it over.

89
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,609
It's empty. See?

90
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,377
What do you mean?

91
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,280
There's no film in this camera.

92
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,820
How come you take a
picture that have no film?

93
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,992
I'm a photographer.

94
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,129
Yeah, and I'm the lone ranger,

95
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,931
only I got no horse.

96
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,672
Next!

97
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,042
Put your bag up.

98
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,324
You never been in here before?

99
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,826
I was a pharmacist.

100
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,662
I ran into some difficulty.

101
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,296
Sign in over here.

102
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,777
Hey!

103
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,545
You hard of hearing?

104
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,848
Hard, but not of hearin'.

105
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,215
Empty out your pockets.

106
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,451
Nothing in my pockets.
Nothing up my sleeves.

107
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,619
Turn around.

108
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,621
Haven't we been through
this routine?

109
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,122
You know the story.

110
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,558
I don't know no story.
Turn around.

111
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,293
I was in nam.

112
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,729
I got shrapnel in my legs.

113
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,665
O.k. Move along.

114
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,432
Thank you kindly, brother.

115
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,201
Don't need no help.

116
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,211
Son of a bitch ball buster.

117
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,284
He knows it's shrapnel.

118
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,852
Son of a...

119
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,754
Thank you kindly.

120
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,597
You don't mind if I
save it for a rainy day?

121
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,532
I don't mind.

122
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,367
Good.

123
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,639
'Cause I got something
better just now.

124
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,947
I'm holding on to a little
piece of the universe.

125
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,049
You believe in god, boy?

126
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,951
Sometimes.

127
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,752
Yeah, I know what you mean.

128
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,856
Sometime he here.
Sometime he not.

129
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:40,060
Right now... He here.

131
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,530
Yeah.

132
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,999
Yeah.

133
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:49,002
This here is the
closest thing to god

134
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,204
you'll find in this place, boy.

135
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,206
Want to touch him?

136
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,808
Nah.

137
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,376
You never know.

138
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,312
You might get struck dumb
with religious faith.

139
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,317
It ain't in the touch anyhow.

140
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,220
Boy, it's... It's in the taste.

142
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,090
This here little pill

143
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,961
made by Mr. Johnson & Johnson,

144
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,596
they god's true
representative on earth.

145
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,100
It ain't the churches or
them synagogues or the pope.

146
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,801
That's just propaganda.

147
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,304
It's the pharmaceutical
companies.

148
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,174
Yeah... Mr. Johnson & Johnson

150
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,510
separating this
black man from his pain.

151
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,213
Hallelujah!

152
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,320
Don't get me wrong, boy.

153
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,123
I seen worse.

154
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,927
Seen a lot of misery in nam.

155
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,697
This is child's play
compared to that.

156
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,066
What's your name?

157
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,370
Matthew.

158
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,107
I'm Jerry.

159
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,643
Where you from, Matthew?

160
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,414
I'm from... The Bronx.

162
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,282
Belt parkway.

163
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,517
Yeah.

164
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,386
I'm from bed stuy.

165
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,565
You never been in one of these
shelters, have you?

166
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:30,037
No, I'm...
Best take care of your property,

168
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,941
otherwise you going
to come up short, boy.

169
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,151
First thing they do,
once you close your eyes,

170
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,154
is creep up
and remove the sneakers.

171
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:52,092
Next thing they do is
jiggle your pockets,

173
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,795
see if you got anything
valuable inside.

174
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,431
This place filled
with bull daggers,

175
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:02,835
knife orders... Junkies...

177
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,405
All sort of weirdoes.

178
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,288
Drifting off now, boy.

179
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,856
Yeah.

180
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,625
Sweet little old painkiller

181
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,128
working its magic.

182
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,380
Aroo!

183
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,582
Aroo!

184
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,030
They're holding on
to their dreams, Matthew.

185
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,365
Only thing they got left.

186
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,149
You sweet meat, boy?

187
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,950
Hey, you're the fucking watch.

188
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,952
Hold out on old Leroy, man.

189
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,655
Next time things be worse.

190
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,089
Oof!

191
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:22,469
Kitty cat,
I'm always where the money's at.

192
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,707
Meow!

193
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,582
Hey, Matthew!

194
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,550
Hey, Matthew!

195
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,117
Come here. Take my picture!

196
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,820
Come over here. Take my picture!

197
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:48,887
Come on, Matthew!

198
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,921
Get over here.

199
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,691
Let me see that fucking camera.

200
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,961
That better be
American made, now.

201
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,331
Let me see that. Nah, nah.

202
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,032
Come on, man.

203
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,168
Come on. How you guys doing?

204
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,571
Hey, John, how you doing?

205
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,772
Let's look.

206
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,509
How you doing, Matthew?

207
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,344
Good. How you doing, John?

208
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,045
Me, I'm good, man.

209
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,314
I'm working for my uncle.

210
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,815
Driving his limo.

211
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,618
My sister asked me
about you the other day.

212
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,919
How's she doing?

213
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,621
Cindy? She's doing good, man.

214
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,592
She got engaged.
Some motherfucker down in sheepshead bay.

215
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:29,462
You know,
I wrote her some letters,

216
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,532
but she never got back to me.

217
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,534
Something happened with my mail.

218
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,136
Yeah, I don't know. Something...

219
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,538
Hey, Matthew.

220
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,540
When you were in the hospital,

221
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,242
did they give you
shock treatment?

222
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,177
Or like drugs?

223
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,513
Some.

224
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,181
No, I don't take drugs.

225
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,617
This dude in school...

226
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,320
When he gave away his overcoat.

227
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,555
Gave away his money,
his mother's jewelry.

228
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,324
Do you need some money?

229
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,825
You guys need some cash?

230
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,327
No, no, no.

231
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,329
Matthew, Matthew,
I don't need it.

232
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,332
I don't want your...
I was just asking...

233
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,634
I don't have much money on me,

234
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,403
but I know where
you could get some.

235
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,204
I don't have much,

236
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,376
but I know guys that do, and...
Yeah.

238
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,810
I'll see you guys around.

239
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,446
Yo. Take care, man.

240
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,013
Take it easy, Matthew.

241
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,515
Thanks for the advice, Matthew.

242
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,703
Mom?

243
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:47,840
Mom?

244
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,712
She's not home.

245
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,347
Do you know where she went?

246
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,350
Florida.
Won't be back till spring.

247
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,486
This key doesn't fit.

248
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,488
She changed the lock.

249
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,192
Why did she do that?

250
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,460
I wouldn't know.

251
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,529
She asked me to water the plants

252
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,130
and pick up the papers.

253
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,665
Can you let me in?

254
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,966
Can't.

255
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,835
Why? I'm her son.

256
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,203
I'm her son.

257
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,705
I got no authority.

258
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,176
We have you residing
at the Jefferson arms

259
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,521
on west 44th street, Manhattan?

260
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,814
There's no hotel there,
just rubble.

261
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,350
Well, then the checks will
eventually be returned here.

262
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:34,353
Why can't I be given
the check directly

263
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,055
to find another apartment?

264
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,232
That's against state policy.

265
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,691
Find an apartment. Notify us.

266
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,394
We'll send the checks
directly to your new landlord.

267
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,830
I got to find a place tonight.

268
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,799
I'm not going back to the
fort Washington armory.

269
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,276
The computer needs
to be reprogrammed

270
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,070
once the checks are sent
here, and that takes time.

271
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,439
I'm not going back!

272
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,182
Then there's the question
of documentation.

273
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,609
What kind of documentation?

274
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,512
We need verification from the
Jefferson arms management.

275
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,114
There is no Jefferson arms
management!

276
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:05,317
I'm trying to tell you there's
no Jefferson arms management.

277
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,387
There's no Jefferson arms!
It doesn't exit!

278
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,927
You owe me a check for $408.

279
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,796
I mean, I'm not crazy.

280
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,932
You owe me a check, you know.

281
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,473
Hey, hey, hey,
the sandwich man is back, y'all.

282
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,174
The sandwich man is back.

283
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,676
Check this out, man.

284
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,144
50 cent apiece.
Check one out, man.

285
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,913
No. No, thanks.

286
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,381
I got Danish, man.

287
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,083
A quarter apiece, man.

288
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,585
Yo, sandwiches, man!

289
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,496
Yo, sandwiches, man!
Liverwurst and danishes.

290
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,054
Hey, y'all pay attention.

291
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,959
You got an extra smoke
on you, bro?

292
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,127
Cigarette?

293
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,194
Yeah, cigarette.

294
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,530
Thank you.

295
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,442
Thank you.

296
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,219
Meow, kitty cat.

298
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,022
I'm always where the money's at.

299
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,291
Don't you know the bowery
rate of exchange, boy?

300
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,359
No.

301
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,294
We here in Washington heights...

302
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,296
That's on the northern tip

303
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,798
of the island of Manhattan...

304
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,034
But we still operate
at the bowery rate.

305
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,268
I don't know it.

306
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,170
20 cents, baby.

307
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,740
Two thin dimes a smoke.

308
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,809
These are my loosies.

309
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,111
I the loosie representative
around here,

310
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,312
you understand?

311
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,782
Now you're setting
a bad example.

312
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,318
Are you taking unfair
advantage of this black man?

313
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,254
How can a man compete?

314
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,989
You giving it away for nothing.

315
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,325
It takes years to establish
a rate of exchange,

316
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,628
and you destroying it
in one night.

317
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,397
Now you declare
economic war on me,

318
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,399
I declare it right back.

319
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,334
You strike first,
now it's my turn.

320
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,070
Leave him alone, little Leroy.

321
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:06,639
Who the fuck said that?

322
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,408
It's Jerry.

323
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,378
It's none of your
business, old man.

324
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,213
Anything reaches my ears,

325
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,585
that touches my eyes is my
business, Leroy.

327
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,220
The man's entitled
to give away his goods

328
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,389
if the man wants to.

329
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,724
He's nothing to you.

330
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,793
What you butting in for?

331
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,795
He's something to me.

332
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,864
He a relative.

333
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,601
What the fuck you mean?
You full of shit.

334
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,402
He's my son.

335
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,570
He white.

336
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,739
You talking skin tone?

337
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:42,441
You mother fucking right
I'm talking skin tone.

338
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,676
What the fuck you think?

339
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,545
Skin tone mean shit,
little Leroy.

340
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,948
He blacker than you,
matter of fact.

341
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,249
He's my son.

342
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,752
His name's Matthew.

343
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,253
Come on, Matthew.

344
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,455
We got to go now.

345
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:57,857
You've seen enough TV.

346
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:58,924
O.k.

347
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,621
How come you said that?

348
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,925
How come I said what?

349
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,930
You know, you said
that I was your son.

350
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,938
It come to me in a...

351
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:48,641
Dream the other night, boy.

352
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,577
We were in Africa

353
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,880
a couple of hundred years ago.

354
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,949
Slave traders
burned down our village.

355
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:00,452
They tried
to take you from me...

356
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,454
Only we fight them.

357
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:09,028
Yeah... You get shot...
Die in my arms.

360
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,540
Don't worry, boy.

361
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:25,011
It was only a dream.

362
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,192
Hot.

363
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,271
Don't you know anything, boy?

364
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:04,510
You got to test the water

365
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,913
before you step in.

366
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:10,416
The last thing a homeless
man can afford to be

367
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,617
is conspicuous.

368
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,619
Now, if you're inconspicuous,

369
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,422
sit in the dunkin donut
or Wendy's

370
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,990
or Roy Rogers,

371
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,993
nurse a cup of coffee
for an hour or two...

372
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:26,132
That a lifesaver
come inclement weather.

373
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,002
What's your story, boy?

374
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,439
I don't have a story.

375
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,875
Hey, every man got a story.

376
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,077
You born on this planet,
ain't ya?

377
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:38,945
Yeah.

378
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,147
Then you got a story.

379
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,358
There the story.

380
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,329
Hey.

381
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,435
What's the matter?
I embarrass you?

382
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,871
No.

383
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,506
Homeless men can't
afford to be embarrassed.

384
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,810
I show you something.

385
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:18,517
This... My story.

387
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,453
This here called
the American dream.

388
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,721
Is this your family?

389
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,124
Wife, little girls,

390
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,193
only they ain't
so little anymore.

391
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,195
They 13 and 14, respectively.

392
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,898
Where are they?

393
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:35,634
Are they... Queens.

395
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,636
She remarried.

396
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:40,406
That... that my house and cars

397
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,474
in the background.

398
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,649
Arthur and I had
a produce market.

399
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,652
He a Vietnam vet, same as me,

400
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,654
only he sell, I buy.

401
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,024
I traveled through
all five boroughs,

402
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,226
parts of Jersey.

403
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,728
Buy big, red, juicy,
beefsteak tomatoes,

404
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,731
sweet bean cherries.

405
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,566
Meantime, he pissing
everything away

406
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,867
on the horses.

407
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:12,238
Lose the business,
house, cars, my family,

409
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,241
everything inside of two months.

410
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,277
Hey, you see
that fellow over there?

411
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,048
He think everything okey-dokey.

412
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,016
Check don't come in,

413
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,652
he only a couple of months
short of homelessness.

414
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,262
Hey, I, I do have a story.

415
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,563
I imagine so.

416
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,766
I had four breakdowns,
one after the other.

417
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,068
Yeah?

418
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:46,272
Yeah, I was, I was hospitalized

420
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,774
between the ages of 17 and, 20.

421
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,276
I was hospitalized

422
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,778
between the ages of 17 and 20.

423
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,280
That ain't a crime.

424
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,781
No, I'm, schizophrenic.

425
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,116
Who call you that?

426
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:58,183
Doctors. Doctors.

427
00:31:58,217 --> 00:31:59,851
Why'd they say that?

428
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,855
Because, I don't know.

430
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:10,862
Because... I...
I hear voices, you know?

433
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,365
There's nothing wrong
with hearing voices.

434
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,432
Yeah?

435
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,968
What about Joan?

436
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,569
She hear voices.

437
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,870
Joan? That Saint Joan.

438
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,806
They don't call her
schizophrenic.

439
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,041
They call her a Saint.

440
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,376
What about Moses?

441
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,577
What about him?

442
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,179
He hear voices.

443
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,315
He hear a voice.

444
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,883
He don't hear that voice,

445
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,586
there'd be no
judeo-Christian tradition.

446
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,887
Honest to god, Matthew.

447
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,889
Moses come down that mountain,

448
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,892
doctors asked him
what'd he hear?

449
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,963
He say... "Thou shalt not kill!"

451
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,366
"Thou shalt not
commit adultery!"

452
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,936
They say, "yeah, Moses?"

453
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,904
You hear that? Voices say that?"

454
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,773
They shoot him full
of thorazine,

455
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,608
lock him up, throw away the key.

456
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:57,876
If it wasn't for voices,

457
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,378
we'd still be pagans, Matthew.

458
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,180
Still be sacrificing
lamb, sheep,

459
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,715
even human beings.

460
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,018
We'd be a race of sacrificers.

461
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,854
Maybe you ain't schizophrenic.

462
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,258
Maybe you're just... A Saint.

464
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,971
Hey, rosario!
How's it going, my man?

465
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,973
Going good, man. What's up?

466
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,384
Can't complain, can't complain.

467
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,377
I'm going to get busy, Matthew.

468
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,515
Go on in.

469
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,752
How come you fine-looking ladies

470
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,054
are hiding your beauty

471
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,789
behind a dirty windshield?

472
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,791
That's no good.

473
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,959
The world needs beauty.

474
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,496
It's starving for beauty.

475
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,698
Am I right, rosario?

476
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,266
You right, Jerry.

477
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,071
Gracias.

478
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:07,912
A rolls.

479
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:09,648
Roll, roll.

480
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,283
Yeah, roll.

481
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,222
Hey, Arthur!

482
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,424
You been in touch
with your broker recently?

483
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,892
No, I haven't seen the man.

484
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,994
I understand the stock market

485
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,997
is going to take a nosedive.

486
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,833
We could lose everything we got!

487
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,302
Could end up on the streets.

488
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,003
If we're not careful.

489
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,840
Maybe we should diversify.
What do you think?

490
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,007
That makes good sense.

491
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,777
Yeah... Mutual funds.

493
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,084
Hondo!

494
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,154
I see. I see. See you later.

495
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,156
We're just trying
to make a buck.

496
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,990
Come on, fellas.
Get off the bridge.

497
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,059
Get out of here! Get moving.

498
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,362
Next time we haul you in.

499
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,130
Let's get out of here.

500
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:00,132
What, are you funny
or something?

501
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,833
What, are you funny?

502
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,136
Get out of here! Get moving!

503
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,138
Take your friend
with you, all right?

504
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,639
Don't come back!

505
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,520
I'm gonna take
a load off, Matthew.

506
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,322
Achin'...deep.

507
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,333
You wanna try?

508
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,635
Go ahead, boy.

509
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,904
Nothing to it.

510
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,693
Come on! Come on!

511
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,781
Don't use that shit.
Use this shit.

512
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,220
Yeah. This is good.

513
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,789
Hey, you got a cigarette?

514
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:04,990
Yeah, I got a smoke.

515
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,226
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,228
You got to be nice, polite.

517
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:11,630
Like I do.

518
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,138
You're under no
obligation whatsoever,

519
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,708
but... We do take gratuities.

521
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,710
Hey, thanks a lot.

522
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,278
Appreciate it.

523
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,779

How'd you do?

534
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,159
I don't know.

535
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,795
I lost count.

536
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,930
Well, start again.

537
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,634
I get distracted. You do it.

538
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,439
Your money, Matthew.

539
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:28,974
A man got to take responsibility

540
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,442
for his own money.

541
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,189
I can't do it.

542
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,224
What do you mean,
you can't do it?

543
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,427
That money ain't goin'
to bite you, boy.

544
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,462
It made of inanimate matter.

545
00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:52,030
Something gets in the way.

546
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,165
What gets in the way?

547
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,503
Thoughts...
Voices, I don't know.

549
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,705
Something always
in the way, Matthew.

550
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,640
No such thing as clear sailing.

551
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:04,342
You just don't know
how to navigate.

552
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,477
I'm going to show you.

553
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,913
No, no. I can't.

554
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,881
Go ahead. Start again.

555
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,383
It's just anxiety, boy.

556
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,051
Ain't no goddamn schizophrenia.

557
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:16,154
Ain't nothing gonna snatch
you away from yourself.

558
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,423
I promise you that.

559
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,392
It'd have to get past
one badass black man.

560
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,796
Go ahead. Count.

561
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,961
16.50.

562
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,964
16.50, and, this.

564
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,165
16.50.

565
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,501
Good.

566
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,970
Drink up, boy.

567
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,172
You earned it.

568
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,874
You passed your first hurdle.

569
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,189
16.50... not bad.

570
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,458
First day on the job.

571
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:29,294
A homeless man can do okay...

572
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,064
If he works 7 to 12 hours
a day washing windshields.

573
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,503
I know a lady

574
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,505
willing to rent me
a railroad flat

575
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,507
on the lower east side.

576
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,573
It's not bad.

577
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,175
In fact, it livable.

578
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,478
It's only, 350 bucks a month.

579
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,846
How about it?

580
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:52,250
We can go our separate
ways or we can...

582
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,585
Pool our resources

583
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:56,955
and rent us an apartment.

584
00:40:57,022 --> 00:41:00,258
Where are we going to get
that kind of money?

585
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,260
We'll work hard, boy.

586
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,629
In a month and a half,

587
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,531
we have ourself
a down payment. Promise.

588
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,999
Honest to god.

589
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,840
What do you say?

590
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,780
Yeah, okay, alright.

591
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,249
Yeah.

592
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,584
We get a roof over our head,

593
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:29,087
we're on the first rung
of the economic ladder.

594
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,156
Yeah...

595
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,167
Lift up your shirt.

596
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,254
This is our first deposit, boy.

597
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,934
Meow.

598
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,005
Kitty cat.

599
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:23,208
I'm always where the money's at.

600
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,611
Come and run your eyes

601
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:28,446
up and down my body
like that, boy.

602
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:32,784
Your white eyes
against my black skin

604
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:35,987
send chills up my spine.

605
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,457
I'm talking to you,
motherfucker.

606
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,768
Now ain't you got no manners,

607
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,561
turning your back
on me like that?

608
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:46,965
Nobody turns his back
on little Leroy, boy...

609
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,299
Nobody.

610
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:52,070
Now, the way I figure it,

611
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,539
your white eyes on my black body

612
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:57,008
has got to cost you something.

613
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,578
I say maybe... 2 or 3 bucks.

615
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,614
What you say, Caesar?

616
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:06,484
I say at least 5, little Leroy.

617
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:08,720
I think you're
selling yourself short.

618
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:11,522
Yeah, I say you're
right, Caesar.

619
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,591
Maybe more.

620
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,961
Maybe 10.

621
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,831
We got a problem here?

622
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,808
You fucked up.

623
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,644
I'm gonna teach you a lesson
once and for all, Mr. Jerry.

624
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:34,711
I'm always interested
in lessons, little Leroy.

625
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,523
This gonna be readin',
writin', or arithmetic?

626
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,016
Arithmetic, motherfucker?

627
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,119
Get some of this.
Come on. You want it?

628
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,054
Get that!

629
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,156
God bless you, motherfucker.

630
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:48,026
Play pussy... Get fucked!

632
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,639
You fucked up my arm, man!

633
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:02,908
Shit!

634
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,010
I'm going to fuck you up, man!

635
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,979
I'm going to fuck you two up!

636
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:34,740
Hey...
Hey, this here my truck, boy.

638
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,642
J and t produce market.

639
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:38,844
I told you.

640
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,980
This is where I used
to carry my produce.

641
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:45,150
It's alright. Come on.

642
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,185
Get in. Come on.

643
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:48,319
Come on.

644
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:49,721
Yeah.

645
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:56,904
Hey, this ain't no setback.

646
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,764
I promise you that, boy.

647
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,434
Hey, hey.

648
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:06,537
We're safer on the streets.

649
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:07,973
Matter of fact,

650
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,875
we're a thousand times safer

651
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:12,577
than in one of those shelters.

652
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,347
No, I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna do that.

654
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,486
What, like if I don't do it...?

655
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,888
What's the matter?

656
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:25,390
What's the matter with you, boy?

657
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:33,531
You listening to
them voices again,

658
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,001
is that it?

659
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,444
You listening to them pill-white

660
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,205
fucking anglo-Saxon voices?

661
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,874
What are they telling you to do?

662
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:44,409
What are they talking about?

663
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,278
He's gonna track us
down, you know, and...

664
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,350
I can't go see
my mother, you know?

665
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,652
She's in Florida.

666
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,488
You hearing me? Where are you?

667
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:58,656
I can see poison fruit.

668
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:00,125
Poison fruit?

669
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,926
Yeah.

670
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,727
You come back here, Matthew.

671
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:04,162
Don't you disappear on me.

672
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:06,464
I need you.

673
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:07,465
No, no!

674
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,534
You're mad at me.

675
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,872
I ain't just Jerry's voice...
Talking...

677
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,807
You understand?

678
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:17,675
We're partners, ain't we?

679
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,144
I need you.

680
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,045
Stop.

681
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,613
Just Jerry's voice
talking to you,

682
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,816
you understand?

683
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,887
Is my voice calling you?

684
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,591
I need you. Where are you?

685
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,160
Jerry?

686
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:36,594
Yeah.

687
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:37,829
I'm here. Yeah?

688
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,898
Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, I'm here.

689
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,566
Yeah, yeah.

690
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,101
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,265
Morning.

692
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:53,771
This service better
than the Hyatt regency.

693
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,343
I figure...
I'll extend my vacation...

695
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,545
Stay here a few more weeks,
Matthew.

696
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:07,052
This fella's name
is Billy Sweetwater.

697
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,853
He half-black, half cherokee.

698
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,056
We were in nam together.

699
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:13,992
Billy got a sweet
old station wagon.

700
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,028
Maybe he'll rent it by the day.

701
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:18,997
What are we going to do with it?

702
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,298
Buy some produce, Matthew.

703
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,534
Bing cherries, green
beans, iceberg lettuce.

704
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,003
All we got to do

705
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,072
is pull up to any
corner in Manhattan

706
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:30,375
and sell it out of
the back of the wagon.

707
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:39,951
Hey... He calls it esmeraldo.

709
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,819
He treat her like a woman

710
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,754
though he spell her name
like a man,

711
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,524
that account he high
on that loco weed.

712
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,959
Billy can fix a car

713
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,996
faster than you can take a piss.

714
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,330
You stay here.

715
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:55,400
He's suspicious
of strangers, okay?

716
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:14,119
What did he say?

717
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,754
He say soon as we got
a roof over our head

718
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,756
or a legitimate apartment,

719
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:20,458
he willing to do
business with us.

720
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:23,394
I tell him we're back
inside of six weeks.

721
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,133
Matthew, traffic jam.

722
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,268
We strike gold, Matthew.

723
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,682
A dime, Matthew.

724
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,917
A dime.

725
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,986
Why, that's no better
than slave labor.

726
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:50,755
I thought we fought
the civil war

727
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,159
to escape these wages.

728
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:58,029
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

729
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:01,366
May all your children be white!

730
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:07,905
No, no!

731
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,146
I don't want you to. Don't.

732
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,517
I'm working my way
through school.

733
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,111
I'll bet. What school is that?

734
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:14,512
The school of hard knocks.

735
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,713
Very funny.

736
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,317
Sometimes we call it
the school of hard yucks.

737
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,652
Hey, tell her your joke.

738
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:22,953
My joke?

739
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,789
The one about the fish.

740
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,991
The fish?

741
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,159
Yeah.

742
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,027
Where do fish keep their money?

743
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,829
I have no idea.

744
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:34,065
In river banks.

745
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,873
Alright, alright. Here.

746
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,709
Th-thanks.

747
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:49,814
I got a... and I said the joke
right. It's river banks, right?

748
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,338
Thanks a lot.

749
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,840
May all your children be white.

750
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:51,909
That's it for today.

751
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,879
Yeah. We'll wait it out.

752
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:08,793
Make no money today.

00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,075

754
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,253

755

00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,581
That's good.

757
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,616
Not bad,
considering the weather.

758
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,917
Yeah.

759
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,457
Got a surprise for you.

760
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,724
For me?

761
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:16,126
What is it?

762
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,528
Open it.

763
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:28,773
What is this?

764
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:29,907
It's film, boy.

765
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,075
It's the real thing.

766
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,978
I know what it is.
I didn't ask for it.

767
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,315
I figured if you're
a photographer, you'd want some.

768
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,584
Jerry, I don't want any film.

769
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,722
It's none of your business.

770
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:52,801
Where the hell you going, boy?

771
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,365
I don't know.
I'm going somewhere.

772
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:56,734
I don't know where.

773
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:59,136
Hey, I didn't mean
nothing by it, boy.

774
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:00,847
You don't want
the film, get rid of it.

775
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,441
Flush it down the toilet
as far as I'm concerned.

776
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:07,077
We ain't going to let a roll
of film get between us.

777
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:09,246
Come on, Matthew.

778
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:44,549
One of my pictures was in
a national photo magazine.

779
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,317
That don't surprise
me none, boy.

780
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:49,354
You got a genuine talent.

781
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,622
How do you know?
You never saw my pictures.

782
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:53,190
Don't need to see them.

783
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,626
Got an instinct.

784
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,932
Once I got sick,
started hearing voices...

786
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:06,404
Nothing came out right.

787
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:08,305
You're young yet, boy.

788
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,541
Give it time.

789
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,281
You okay?

790
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:18,416
Fine. It's nothing.

791
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,885
It's the weather, that's it.

792
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,425
S-Son of a bitch.

793
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,960
What's the matter?

794
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,662
Run out of pills.

795
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:34,164
Run out of these
little god damn painkillers.

796
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,401
Got to go to the v.A...

797
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,536
And get some more pills.

798
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,976
Appreciate it, boy. Here.

799
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:49,647
Yeah, that feels good.

800
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,354
Yeah.

801
00:55:57,422 --> 00:56:01,659
Once we get us an
apartment of our own,

803
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:05,295
we're going to rent
that station wagon.

804
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,566
I know a fella on staten island

805
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:11,469
sells green beans by the bushel.

806
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:15,005
Know another fella
this side of the verazano bridge

807
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,574
that sells iceberg lettuce.

808
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,810
All we got to do, boy,

809
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:23,147
is pull up on any street corner
in Manhattan,

810
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,350
sell that produce right
out of the back of the wagon.

811
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:29,153
One, two, three loads a day.

812
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,521
Honest to god.

813
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,289
Hey, we going to make us

814
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,859
an economic recovery, Matthew.

815
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,828
Yeah.

816
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:41,265
That's better.

817
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,133
Yeah. This feels great.

818
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,468
I'm not going back
to the shelter.

819
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:18,836
We never going back there.

820
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:21,606
Let's ride
the "a" train all night.

821
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,604
How's fort Washington?

822
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,806
We can't go back there anymore.

823
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:30,174
Run into some trouble.

824
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,009
You on the streets?

825
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:34,078
Yeah. Been sleeping
in the truck,

826
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:35,946
only they tow it away.

827
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,447
Listen, man,

828
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,884
why don't you shack up my place?

829
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,152
We wouldn't want to inconvenience
you, rosario.

830
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,520
Fuck that.

831
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:47,592
Tamsen and I, we going to be in
galveston in a couple of days.

832
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:13,618
Something smells good.

833
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:16,153
What you cooking, spits?

834
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,689
Cooking hoppin' John.

835
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:21,892
Red beans and rice is very nice.

836
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:23,994
You're going to want some twice.

837
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,230
It ready when you be, rosario.

838
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,932
I always ready.

839
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:30,635
You got enough for my friends
Matthew and Jerry?

840
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:33,270
Yeah. Got plenty. Plenty.

841
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,872
This here's spits.

842
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,641
He share the place with us.

843
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,376
Actually, he here before us.

844
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:43,047
Been here ever since they
condemned the building.

845
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,883
Hey, it's okay my friends stay
a couple of days?

846
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,351
Sure.

847
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,620
Make yourself to home.

848
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,356
I'll go get
a couple of more bowls.

849
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,758
Appreciate that.

850
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,761
How's tamsen doing?

851
00:59:56,827 --> 01:00:00,064
She's sleeping soundly.

852
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,100
Hey, where you
fellas been hanging out?

853
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:04,601
Fort Washington,

854
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,637
but we on the streets just now.

855
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:09,206
I was at the Atlantic
shelter before here.

856
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,540
Biffin Avenue?

857
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,543
Wake up one morning,
got nothing in my mouth.

858
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,780
Can you imagine some
fella walking around

859
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:18,182
with my old teeth in his mouth?

860
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,421
That's cold.

861
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:26,556
You got to be real bad off

862
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,693
to steal a man's choppers.

863
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:32,730
Hey, young blood.

864
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:34,631
Come on, get some
of this good stuff here.

865
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,734
No. Don't be shy.

866
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:38,645
Got more than enough
to get through the winter.

867
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:41,872
All a body need is
a sack of rice

868
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:44,174
and some wild horses.

869
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,575
Who's smoking?

870
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,244
Eat some of this, mamita.

871
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,682
Give me a drag.

872
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,657
That's my limit.

873
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:05,029
Trying to keep her
safe and sound.

874
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,230
Who are you?

875
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,331
Matthew.

876
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,633
If I'd known
you was inviting company over,

877
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,468
I would've put out
the clean linen.

878
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:14,038
Tamsen from buffalo.

879
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,873
That's why she got
a sense of humor.

880
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:18,275
There's nothing funny
about buffalo.

881
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,744
Ran away from buffalo.

882
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,678
My sister did before me, too.

883
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:23,080
We met on the street.

884
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:25,750
Yeah, in front of the 42nd
street library.

885
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:27,551
He come up to me and say,

886
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,386
"want to see my tattoo?"

887
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,355
And I say, "not particularly."

888
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,689
You say worse than that,

889
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:34,491
but I show it to you anyhow.

890
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:37,094
Yeah. We was really close.

891
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,797
We spent the whole summer
in battery park.

892
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:41,331
Remember, rosario?

893
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:42,867
I remember.

894
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,534
We saw a shooting star

895
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,170
fall from the sky one night.

896
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,239
Yeah. I made a wish
on that star.

897
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:52,877
Pretty soon,
it's gonna come true.

898
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:02,539
Picking up the tickets
tomorrow, mamita.

899
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:06,210
We going to be working the
24-hour shift at Teddy's place.

900
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,913
It's a 24-hour
truck stop and diner.

901
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:12,016
Tamsen gonna cook. I pump gas.

902
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,919
That's the arrangement.

903
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,987
What's the matter?

904
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:18,355
The baby moved.

905
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,290
It moved?

906
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,426
Yeah.

907
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:23,827
Again. Feel it?

908
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:25,095
No.

909
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:29,866
There.

910
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:31,568
That's it?

911
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:32,802
Yes.

912
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,371
That's my baby?

913
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:02,599
Like to give you a going-away
present, rosario.

914
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,168
Like to give you

915
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:08,138
the best damn spit shine ever.

916
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,976
The spirit willing,

917
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:15,980
but the flesh say
no go, rosario.

918
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,982
It's okay, spits.

919
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:20,084
You've done enough already.

920
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,320
Why don't you lay on
your hands, Matthew?

921
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,990
Maybe it'll help.

922
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,391
What you mean?

923
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:30,594
My leg hurting me
on account of shrapnel.

924
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,631
Matthew lay on his
hands, pain go away.

926
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:36,700
It go away?

927
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,768
Not entirely, you understand.

928
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:41,105
It go away temporarily though.

929
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,609
That good enough for me.

930
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:49,879
I... i can't do that.

931
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,983
It... it don't hurt to try, boy.

932
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,227
Something's happening.

933
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:46,103
My hands.

934
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,013
I can bend them.
They don't hurt.

935
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:58,882
Let me see that.

936
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,950
It's like a miracle.

937
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,019
Let me see.

938
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,458
It worked.

939
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,463
Spits, man, that's unbelievable.

940
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,901
We're not gonna wait

941
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,204
till after you're dead, Matthew,

942
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,572
like the rest of them saints.

943
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:26,042
You understand?

944
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:37,121
We'll take care of you now.

945
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,627
You're Saint Matthew.

946
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,231
You're Saint of all
the homeless people.

947
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,845
Two tickets to galveston.

948
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,381
Hey, hey, let me take a picture.

949
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:19,663
You finished the roll.
That's good, boy.

950
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,033
Hey, w-what do you say,

951
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,836

952
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,439
Come on.

953
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,356
♪ Pop, pop, pop ♪♪

954
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:53,863
That cold gets in
your body, it never leaves.

955
01:08:58,768 --> 01:08:59,903
I'm bleeding.

956
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:02,906
What?

957
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:07,076
My god, spits.
I'm... I'm bleeding.

958
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,379
My god.

959
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:11,181
Come on. You lie down here.

960
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:12,982
I'll go get somebody.

961
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,684
I don't wanna lose the baby.

962
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:19,356
You're not gonna lose the baby.
Now you just stay here. You hear?

963
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:21,425
I'll be right back.

964
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,900
Spits!

965
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,604
God.

966
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:41,778
Spits!

967
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:14,844
Tamsen. I... I'm
looking for tamsen.

968
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,246
Come on.

969
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,091
It was a boy, rosario.

970
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,993
It was a baby boy.

971
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:34,223
Hey, rosario, take
a load off, man.

972
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,759
I tell you we take care of you.

973
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,226
You're in no condition to work.

974
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,195
I got to work, man.

975
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,830
You don't understand, man.

976
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:42,532
I got to do something.

977
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,347
Take your hands off my car.

978
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:59,182
It's okay. I clean it up nice.

979
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,226
I don't want you touching
the car. You hear me?

980
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,355
I hear you. You don't have to
pay. It's your lucky day.

981
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:06,723
I do it for free.

982
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,559
Why don't you get a
job, you fucking bum?

983
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:16,433
What did you say?

984
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,635
What did you call me?

985
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:21,104
I'm trying to make a living,

986
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,573
and you call me a bum!

987
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:30,179
I'm a bum!

988
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,752
A bum!

989
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,435
Hey! Hey, rosario!

990
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:53,503
Get out of there, rosario!

991
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,839
Rosario, get your ass
out of here!

992
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,808
Get out of here.

993
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:18,194
Get out of here!

994
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:19,261
Alright.

995
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:20,830
Get out of here!

996
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,574
You guys come and see us.

997
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,809
Maybe we'll do that, rosario.

998
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:35,187
I'll come out and see you and
your babies one of these days.

999
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:37,581
I imagine you're going
to have two or three.

1000
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:40,049
What do you imagine, Matthew?

1001
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:41,518
I imagine, like, five.

1002
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:44,454
Yeah. He got a better
imagination.

1003
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,423
We going to miss you guys.

1004
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:08,678
My hand's stopped working, boy.

1005
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:13,983
I don't believe no...
Doing no good.

1006
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,352
Where you going, Jerry?

1007
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,421
Somewhere.

1008
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:20,189
I got to keep moving, boy.

1009
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,494
I got to keep moving.

1010
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:27,597
I can't... I can't stay still.

1011
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,401
Don't make it through
the night like this, boy.

1012
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,468
I need something.

1013
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:34,738
What do you need?

1014
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,239
I'm burning up, buddy.

1015
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:40,476
I'm...
I need, damn pain killers.

1017
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,785
Jerry.

1018
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:51,821
Where you going?

1019
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:55,659
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!

1020
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:03,700
No, Jerry.

1021
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:07,035
Let me go.

1022
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,104
Let me go.

1023
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:10,406
Let me go!

1024
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:12,609
You're crazy.

1025
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,071
It's alright, boy.

1026
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:44,674
Okay, it's alright.

1027
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,811
What are you doing, boy?

1028
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:24,380
Come on, Jerry. Get up.
It's rush hour.

1029
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,182
I'm tired. Leave me alone.

1030
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:39,162
Come on, Jerry. Get up.
We're losing money.

1031
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:41,130
Go away, Matthew!

1032
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:44,333
One day more or less
don't matter.

1033
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,835
It matters, Jerry.

1034
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:47,671
We don't want
to lose the apartment.

1035
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:49,348
The woman's waiting.
She's got the keys.

1036
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:53,576
What apartment? It was
just a pipe dream anyhow.

1037
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:55,712
What are you talking about?

1038
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,448
Come on, Jerry.

1039
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:02,351
What are you talking about?

1040
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,553
This our reality.

1041
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,589
What you see is what you get.

1042
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,091
What about the station wagon

1043
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:09,505
with the fruits and vegetables?

1044
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,694
We're almost there.

1045
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,096
I'm going to sleep.

1046
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:15,932
You're just going to lie
down there and die, Jerry?

1047
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:19,535
You're giving up.

1048
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:21,204
You... you're giving up, Jerry.

1049
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,906
I ain't up to it.

1050
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,341
I'm telling you
something. Go away.

1051
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:28,177
No, I'm not going away.
I'm never going away.

1052
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,612
Get up.

1053
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:30,914
Why can't you...

1054
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,516
Are you crazy or something?

1055
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:34,818
What's wrong with you?

1056
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:36,720
We're going to work,
get some money,

1057
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:38,054
and get that apartment.

1058
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:39,689
You out of your fucking mind?

1059
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:42,358
Come on. Let's go,
Jerry. Come on.

1060
01:17:44,227 --> 01:17:45,294
God damn, boy.

1061
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,496
You're a fucking
slave driver. Come on!

1062
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:49,766
Fucking slave driver!

1063
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:53,737
Come on, Jerry.

1064
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,857
Just trying to make it,
not take it.

1065
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:17,927
Hey, thanks a lot.

1066
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:19,796
This is your world.

1067
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:21,297
We just live in it.

1068
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:24,934
How you doing, Jerry?

1069
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:28,271
I'm doing alright now, boy.

1070
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,306
I... i appreciate it.

1071
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,741
I saved your ass.

1072
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:33,309
You saved mine.

1073
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,578
That's the way
it's going to be. Yeah.

1074
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,902
I've got to get back
to the park!

1075
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:07,536
I've got to feed the pigeons.

1076
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:08,704
Walk yourself in there.

1077
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,273
I've got to feed the pigeons.

1078
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:13,877
The pigeons are going to starve
if I don't feed them.

1079
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:14,987
We'll feed them tonight.

1080
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:16,179
Relax. No!

1081
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:17,813
Let go of me!

1082
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:19,682
I am not going!

1083
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,417
Let go of me!

1084
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:25,488
You have any I.D.?

1085
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:29,125
I.d.? Yeah. Identification.

1086
01:20:30,026 --> 01:20:31,427
Where you live?

1087
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,930
We don't have
an address just yet.

1088
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:36,132
We're working on it, though.

1089
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:38,201
Where are you going
to sleep tonight?

1090
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,267
Wherever.

1091
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:40,536
In the streets?

1092
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:42,939
Just now.

1093
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:45,041
Get in that Van. There's
a cold weather alert.

1094
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:46,919
We're just going to take you
a shelter for tonight.

1095
01:20:46,943 --> 01:20:48,344
I don't want to go to a shelter.

1096
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:51,414
Listen, the men go to the
fort Washington armory.

1097
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,182
I'm not going.

1098
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,818
You can't stay out here.
It's below freezing.

1099
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:56,896
You can't stay out here.

1100
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,021
We're okay. Let's go.

1101
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,989
Wait a minute.
I'm talking to you.

1102
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:02,191
We ain't broken no law.

1103
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:05,161
We can do this easy,
or we'll use force.

1104
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:06,562
We ain't going to no shelter.

1105
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,331
This is a free country, okay?

1106
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:11,267
This is a free country, hear?

1107
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,334
Take it easy.

1108
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:13,636
Take it easy.

1109
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:16,172
Jerry.

1110
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,573
Hey.

1111
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,774
Jerry.

1112
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:22,178
Jerry.

1113
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:23,846
Matthew!

1114
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:26,315
I don't want to go.

1115
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,483
Get him up there.

1116
01:21:28,784 --> 01:21:30,253
Jerry.

1117
01:21:31,787 --> 01:21:32,888
Jerry!

1118
01:21:32,956 --> 01:21:35,158
Cuff him.
I'll get the radio car.

1119
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:58,014
He's not a criminal.

1120
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:35,451
Alright, guys. Let's go.

1121
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:36,719
Come on.

1122
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:39,455
Move it.

1123
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:41,457
Let's get on in there.

1124
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:44,227
Inside, fellas.

1125
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,365
Let's go.

1126
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:03,979
Where your daddy, boy?

1127
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:05,681
He desert you?

1128
01:23:05,748 --> 01:23:06,915
I got to go.

1129
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,551
You don't want out of this.

1130
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:09,452
I got to go.

1131
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:12,521
It's cold out there.
Come on, now.

1132
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,048
You want to keep your sneaks,

1133
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:04,207
put them away,

1134
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:06,409
or somebody's going
to come calling.

1135
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:14,417
What's your name?

1136
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:17,553
Jason.

1137
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,155
I'm Matthew.

1138
01:24:23,326 --> 01:24:25,628
This place is no picnic.

1139
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,599
Watch your things.

1140
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:02,765
Meow!

1141
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:04,032
What the fuck, man?

1142
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,068
Kitty cat, I'm always
where the money's at.

1143
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:09,104
That's a mighty fine ring

1144
01:25:09,172 --> 01:25:10,373
you got there, boy.

1145
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:13,642
It's going to look
nice on my pinkie.

1146
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:15,844
Take your shit off,

1147
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:17,085
or I'm going to cut it off.

1148
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:21,450
Take it off, boy.

1149
01:25:23,686 --> 01:25:24,553
Help!

1150
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,322
Who you fucking with,
motherfucker?

1151
01:25:26,389 --> 01:25:28,056
Who the fuck you fucking with?

1152
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:29,792
Help! Help!

1153
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,094
Help!

1154
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:33,562
What the fuck is this?

1155
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:36,299
I'm going to take
your shit now, motherfucker.

1156
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:38,301
Leave him alone!

1157
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:40,169
Get the fuck back
to your cot, Leroy.

1158
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:41,713
Why you fronting
for his white ass?

1159
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,272
I'm doing what I'm
supposed to do.

1160
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:44,707
Do what I say.

1161
01:25:44,773 --> 01:25:46,141
Get back to your cot.

1162
01:25:47,343 --> 01:25:49,812
You made a big mistake, boy.

1163
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:54,250
You fucker.

1164
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,553
Chill.

1165
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:48,471
Going somewhere, boy?

1166
01:26:49,438 --> 01:26:51,206
You ain't going nowhere.

1167
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,829
Meow!

1168
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:23,499
No. Hey, man.

1169
01:29:29,732 --> 01:29:31,099
That's it.

1170
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:32,194
Are these babies?

1171
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,563
Yep. Little homeless babies.

1172
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:36,599
How come there's so many?

1173
01:30:36,665 --> 01:30:39,535
We wait a few days until
there's a good-sized load.

1174
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:41,279
Otherwise, it ain't
worthwhile going over.

1175
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:42,538
Where you taking them?

1176
01:30:42,605 --> 01:30:44,773
Potter's field over
on hart island,

1177
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,042
just off long island sound.

1178
01:30:51,213 --> 01:30:53,281
There anyone you know?

1179
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,383
Yes.

1180
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,152
A relative?

1181
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,955
My son.

1182
01:31:00,022 --> 01:31:01,724
I'm sorry.

1183
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,659
I'd like to see the funeral.

1184
01:31:03,726 --> 01:31:05,761
There is no funeral.

1185
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:07,596
We just place them in the ground

1186
01:31:07,663 --> 01:31:10,065
and cover them up with earth.

1187
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:12,100
I'd like to be there.

1188
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:13,536
I wish you could take you,

1189
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:16,438
but it's against
city regulations.

1190
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:19,307
You mean I can
never visit the grave?

1191
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:21,710
I'm sorry.

Right, Matthew?

1218
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,053
My sweet Matthew.

1219
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:56,091
I'll remember you, boy.

1220

1222

Hey, your pictures come back.

1223
01:35:06,935 --> 01:35:09,037
Nice and sharp.

1224
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,674
You take a real beauty.

1225
01:35:15,778 --> 01:35:18,346

I'm starting over now, boy.

1245
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:04,012
Have a nice evening.

01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:05,847
Nothing's going

Why a lovely lady like you

hide behind a dirty windshield?

1253
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:28,370
The world needs beauty,
lots of beauty, ma'am.

1254
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,941
Thank you kindly.
