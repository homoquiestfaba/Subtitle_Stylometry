1
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,833
Oh, saviour of China,

2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,632
you have ennobled the House of Fa.

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,029
In gratitude, we honour you.

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,953
O, veneration to you,

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,349
O, mighty...

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,317
Say it, say my name.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,118
Mushu.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,070
That's what I'm talking about.
How you doing up there, man?

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,991
Thanks for the intro.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,631
And now, I think I'd like to visit
my beloved pedestal.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,389
Let's get it over with.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,794
Ceremonial robe of honour.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,908
If Mulan could see me now.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,910
Mulan saves China one time,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,594
and now he thinks he's the emperor.

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,958
I'm climbing a stairway to heaven.

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,793
Top floor.

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,713
Pedestals, perks and props.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,314
Ceremonial bath of honour.

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,519
Yeah.
Y'all better take a deep breath now,

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,875
'cause I ain't leaving my pedestal

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,758
for the next thousand years.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,794
Let the whirlpool begin.

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,629
Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,234
According to this chart,
I put the coins here.

26
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,677
Relax, child.

27
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,955
The spirits tell me Shang will arrive

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,600
and propose to Mulan
before the sun sets.

29
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,194
Still time to get in on the pool.

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,111
Mother.

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,716
Gambling is like playing Mah Jongg
with blank tiles.

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,519
No one really wins.

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,518
I'm enriched by your presence,
my son.

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,030
I think I'll go pray.

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,791
Hello, Sha-Ron.

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,313
Is Fa Mulan here?

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,709
She's out in the field.

38
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,439
Yeah, doing her chores.

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,556
I'll go help her.

40
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,350
Thank you.

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,989
The children all love Mulan.

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,198
And why not? She's strong,
she's brave, she's beautiful.

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,757
She's a chip off the old block.

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,672
It's okay, Little Brother.
What's going on here?

45
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,354
We want to be like you, Fa Mulan.

46
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,510
But I'm still learning myself.

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,830
Please.

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,037
Okay. I guess I can show you
a few moves.

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,509
Mulan's gonna teach us
how to kick butt.

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,750
Hooray!

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,513
Hold it, calm down.

52
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,830
That's lesson number two.

53
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,196
The first and most important lesson
is to be gentle.

54
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,953
At the same time, we're being tough.

55
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,272
- How can you be tough and gentle?
- Yeah, I want to be tough.

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,349
Yeah!

57
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,591
I know it does
sound a little funny, huh?

58
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,639
But the world is full of opposites,
and so are you.

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,475
To be a good warrior,
you must bring it all into balance.

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,551
Let's see if this helps.

61
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,030
Earth, sky. Day, night.

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,999
Sound and silence.
Dark and light.

63
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,469
One alone is not enough

64
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,358
You need both together

65
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,070
Winter, summer
Moon and sun

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,669
- Lesson number one
- Wow!

67
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,475
Like a rock
You must be hard

68
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,155
Like an oak
You must stand firm

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,596
Cut quick like my blade

70
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,912
Think fast
Unafraid

71
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,795
Like a rock
I must be hard

72
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,429
Like an oak
I must stand firm

73
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,671
Cut quick like my blade

74
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,311
Think fast
Unafraid

75
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,072
Okay, Mulan, I'm ready.

76
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,077
But you're still out of balance.
You're only halfway there.

77
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,994
Like a cloud
You are soft

78
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,914
Like bamboo
You bend in the wind

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,710
Creeping slow
You're at peace because you know

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,429
It's okay to be afraid

81
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,994
Like a cloud
I am soft

82
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,755
Like bamboo
I bend in the wind

83
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,277
Creeping slow
I'm at peace because I know

84
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,511
It's okay to be afraid

85
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,952
One alone is not enough

86
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,431
You need both together

87
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,877
Winter, summer
Moon and sun

88
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,115
Lesson number one

89
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,954
Like a rock
I must be hard

90
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,191
Like bamboo
I bend in the wind

91
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,671
- You can fly
- i'm at peace because I know

92
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,673
It's okay to be afraid

93
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,754
- You have begun
- Lesson number one

94
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,071
It's General Shang.

95
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,233
Hello, little warriors.

96
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,795
Your new uniform suits you, General.

97
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,075
The uniform, yes.

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,476
Now I just have to live up to it.

99
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,869
Of course you will.
You're very brave.

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,919
Oh, right. Brave. Yes, well...

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,719
Mulan, I haven't known you
for very long,

102
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,633
but I feel that doesn't matter so much
when a man is in...

103
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,597
When a man is in...

104
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,396
Is there someplace private
we can talk?

105
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,152
We can go to my house.

106
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,912
Okay, everybody.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,230
Time to be like the river
and flow home.

108
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,750
Bye, Shang. Bye, Mulan.

109
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,310
Could you take care of this for me?

110
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,994
You're never gonna get that back.

111
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,677
She said yes.

112
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,038
When one's heart
is overfilled with joy,

113
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,554
some may spill from the eyes.

114
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,756
You can say that again.

115
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,229
I win the pot.

116
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,349
Actually, you bet he would propose
before sundown.

117
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,193
I bet he would propose
before noon.

118
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,748
But, you don't gamble.

119
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,559
Betting against my mother
is not a gamble.

120
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,471
It's an investment.

121
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,993
Oh, what a happy day.

122
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,150
My little baby's getting married.

123
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,071
Mushu, someone will hear you.

124
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,596
I can't help it.
You know dragons are very emotional.

125
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,229
Seems like just last month,
you and I were saving China.

126
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,754
- It was last month.
- How time flies.

127
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,274
You know, this must be
a magical moment for you.

128
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,032
It's not every day I get engaged.

129
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,076
I meant telling me you're engaged.

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,628
I'm the guy that gave you
and pretty boy the hook-up.

131
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Am I a guardian,
or am I a guardian?

132
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,708
You're more than that.

133
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,995
You're my most trusted friend.

134
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,868
- Oh, that did it.
- Are you crying again?

135
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,394
No, I just got some
exfoliating cream in my eye.

136
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,392
Of course I'm crying, girl.
What you think? Oh, Mulan.

137
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,472
- I'm just so happy for me.
- You?

138
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,879
This wedding business
is a big status boost for me.

139
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,394
When the ancestors
look up the career ladder,

140
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,357
all they're gonna see is my behind.

141
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,716
So glad my getting married
is helping you out.

142
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,475
All right, I get you, Miss Missy.
But I'm thinking about you too.

143
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,028
I'll plan your wedding.
I gotta work me up a theme.

144
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,758
Theme is everything.

145
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,912
How about "Rainbow of Memories?"

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,639
That's too junior prom.
I've got it.

147
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,551
The theme is, "Think Pink. "

148
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,553
You know, pink is the new red.
It's simple, it says it. Watch my smoke.

149
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,473
Cri-kee, to the fabric store.

150
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,358
Mulan, seems your grandma
invited someone

151
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,715
to help us celebrate
the engagement.

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,950
Really? Who?

153
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,837
- China.
- Congratulations!

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,557
Isn't it wonderful?

155
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,631
Sorry it's sort of slapdash.

156
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,188
It took us by surprise, you know.

157
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,989
Make way for the happy couple.

158
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,832
- Now this is a battlefield.
- What's our strategy, General?

159
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,798
Divide and conquer.

160
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,510
All right, dead people.

161
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,556
We've got work,
so move with purpose.

162
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,029
I've got an important announcement
to make.

163
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,193
Hold on to your ectoplasm now.
Mulan's getting married.

164
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,797
All right. Simmer down.
I know just how you feel.

165
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,110
But time is wasting. Move.

166
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,156
The theme is pink.

167
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,390
I want to see pink flowers,
ribbons, bows.

168
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,516
I'm not talking about salmon.
No blush.

169
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,353
I mean pink as a freshly-slapped
newborn's behind.

170
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,034
- How about a pink slip?
- Excuse me?

171
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,475
Nobody wants to see your drawers,
Prunehilda.

172
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,790
Actually, she meant this.

173
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,518
Hey, this looks like
a for-real pink slip.

174
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,433
You know,
like a "you're fired" pink slip.

175
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,476
- Oh, it is.
- Say what?

176
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,231
The pink slip is for you.

177
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,834
It is written,
once a woman marries,

178
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,319
her husband's ancestors

179
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,358
take over the duty
of guardianship.

180
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,319
No. Your scroll must have a typo.
That can't be.

181
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,949
- But it is. You're out of a job.
- Out of a pedestal.

182
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,110
And out of our hair, fool.

183
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,829
No, no.
I ain't going out like this.

184
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,832
It took me 500 years to get
this pedestal back,

185
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,558
and I ain't about to give it up.

186
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,518
Hear me, you lazy lounge lizard.

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,910
The moment Fa Mulan is married,
you've got your old job back.

188
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,036
Remember gong duty?

189
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,588
Perhaps this will ring a bell.

190
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,670
Mushu's on his way out

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,355
What am I gonna do?

192
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,355
- So, tell me, will it be a big wedding?
- Absolutely.

193
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,032
No, absolutely not.

194
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,508
- Children?
- As many as possible.

195
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,318
Maybe one or two.

196
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,550
- We'll think about it.
- Right away.

197
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,473
- Blue... Mild... Yes.
- Pink... Spicy... No.

198
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,676
Oh, dear. Did you hear that?

199
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,673
- Not exactly a harmonious couple.
- What should we do?

200
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,558
Perhaps we should give our gift
to the children now.

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,276
General Shang, Fa Mulan,
orders from His Majesty, the Emperor.

202
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,672
- Is there trouble?
- Yes. Report to the Imperial Palace.

203
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,273
We'll leave at once.

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,558
This must be important
for the emperor to want both of us.

205
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,631
He knows a winning team
when he sees one.

206
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,631
Since when are they the winning team?

207
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,518
Ink's not dry on my pink slip,
and I'm being replaced.

208
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,708
Yeah, I know. You're right.

209
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,836
How could I have been so selfish?

210
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,559
Look at them.
Those two clearly got it going on.

211
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,837
I've made a decision.
I've got to kiss my pedestal good-bye,

212
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,354
cos my girl's happiness comes first.

213
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,314
- Baba. Mama.
- We were admiring the mudan tree.

214
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,391
It's so lovely this year.

215
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,948
The blossoms reach
for the sunlight above,

216
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,591
yet, unseen, the roots reach
for the rainwater below.

217
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,079
Sun and rain.

218
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,914
So different,
yet only by working together

219
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,549
do they create harmony and life.

220
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,598
I know, the lesson of yin and yang.

221
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,275
And, to help you
remember that lesson...

222
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,749
Father, mother, your necklaces.

223
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,196
Not ours, our great-great grandparents'.

224
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,477
And now, yours.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,788
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, they're so beautiful.

226
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,873
But, you'll be surprised how heavily
they can weigh.

227
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,111
To share the burden,
you must work together,

228
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,431
like the sun and rain.

229
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,914
Wait a minute,
old man Fa-Zhou got a point now.

230
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,436
Mulan and Shang
are as different as sun and rain.

231
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,112
When the infatuation wears off,

232
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,839
their tree of life is going to
wind up with root rot.

233
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,997
Yeah, sure. She seems happy.
That's the real tragedy.

234
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,594
The girl don't even realise
how miserable she is.

235
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,750
That's why I gotta
nip this thing in the bud.

236
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,351
This is not about my pedestal.

237
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,319
This is about Mulan making
the biggest mistake of my...

238
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,391
I mean, her life.

239
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,470
Man, how could I have been so selfish?

240
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,755
Mulan's a girl worth fighting for.

241
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,912
And, after all,
I am the girl's guardian.

242
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,072
Cri-Kee, I'm gonna break them up.

243
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,634
So, I guess that means
you're on board?

244
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,071
Mulan, could you smooth out the ride
a little? I'm getting horse sick.

245
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,950
- Mushu, what are you doing here?
- Whither thou go, I goeth, girl.

246
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,157
Remember, teamwork ain't about ego,
it's about "we go. "

247
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,754
Cri-Kee, what are you doing here?

248
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,269
Protect Mulan from me?
I'm her guardian.

249
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,148
Yeah, you're her lucky cricket.
Lucky I don't break out the bug spray.

250
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,036
As we stand here, Mongol forces
are moving closer to our border.

251
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,714
The threat of attack
is growing every day.

252
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,395
As it is, our army's
hopelessly outnumbered.

253
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,916
Your Majesty, let me lead my forces
in a pre-emptive strike.

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,468
Each of my warriors
will fight like ten Mongols.

255
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,629
No, General.

256
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,599
I plan to defeat this enemy
without the use of force.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,956
Instead, we will
forge a union so strong,

258
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,759
the Mongol hordes
won't dare attack.

259
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,957
An alliance with
the kingdom of Qui Gong.

260
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,635
We will become united
through marriage.

261
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,156
You will escort three princesses
to Qui Gong.

262
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,198
There, they will marry
Lord Chin's sons,

263
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,555
and seal this critical alliance.

264
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,278
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,635
My advisors tell me
the charts are clear.

266
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,837
If this wedding does not take place
in three days,

267
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,196
the alliance will crumble and
the Mongols will destroy us.

268
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,590
Mark my words, General.
Three days.

269
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,238
Not a moment more.

270
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,352
I know that face, Fa Mulan.
What troubles you?

271
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,398
Your Majesty, an arranged marriage?

272
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,758
Rest assured, child.

273
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,957
My daughters know exactly
what they're doing.

274
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,678
Your daughters?

275
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,150
They consider it an honour to marry
in the cause of peace.

276
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,277
Your Majesty, I...

277
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,749
Apology accepted.

278
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,638
General, how many troops
do you estimate you will need

279
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,280
- to accomplish this mission?
- Three.

280
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,112
- Companies?
- Three men.

281
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,715
You surprise me.
These are my children.

282
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,360
This mission does not call
for force, but finesse.

283
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,510
We must become one
with the countryside.

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,830
As emperor, I trust you.

285
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,074
As a father, I implore you
to choose your three soldiers wisely.

286
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,391
- I know just the men. Fearless.
- Loyal.

287
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,835
- Disciplined.
- China's most honourable

288
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,075
and noble soldiers.

289
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,158
And stay out!

290
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,548
I've found wives
for hundreds of men,

291
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,029
but the Golden Dragon of Unity himself

292
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,953
couldn't make love matches
for you three.

293
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,589
Come back when
you get personalities.

294
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,116
Well, that's a fine way
to treat China's greatest...

295
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,708
...heroes.

296
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,597
What's her problem?

297
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,150
All I asked for was a girl who
would worship the dirt I walk on.

298
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,199
I simply asked for someone who would
cook for me morning, noon and night.

299
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,555
And I just wanted a girl
who likes to laugh,

300
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,870
and thinks I'm a god.

301
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
Perhaps we weren't specific enough.

302
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,670
Forget that dragon lady.

303
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,797
The only ones who can
find girls worthy of us is us.

304
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,915
Yeah.

305
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,470
Well, I don't need her
To be all smug and snooty

306
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,989
I got a plaque right here
That says I kicked Hun booty

307
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,314
We have everything
We dreamed we'd find

308
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,277
When we came back from war

309
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,952
Yeah, everything but...

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,560
A girl worth fighting for

311
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,519
- Hey, suck in your gut.
- There's a girl worth fighting for

312
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,353
And I think she wants us
to come over.

313
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,718
My girl won't laugh at all my jokes
But tell it to me straight

314
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,155
She'll rub my head when I get sick

315
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,959
And let me pick off of her plate

316
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,397
If Ling can find a girl
Who likes his chopstick nose trick

317
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,392
He really better just propose quick

318
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,112
Well, I have to say
Based on today, I'm cranky

319
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,751
- I'll just spend my life with you two
- Pass the hanky

320
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,910
And there's no one there
To steal my chair

321
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,594
And twirl around the floor

322
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,229
I wish I had
A girl worth fighting for

323
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,270
I would be true
To a girl worth fighting...

324
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,430
I'd make fondue
For a girl worth fighting...

325
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
I'd even kiss you
For a girl worth fighting

326
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,917
For

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,194
Mulan.

328
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,713
General Shang.

329
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,719
If you three aren't too busy
disturbing the peace,

330
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,631
I need you to join us
on a mission.

331
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,631
- To save China?
- Naturally.

332
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,794
I'll be leaving behind a few
broken hearts, but count me in.

333
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,633
- Sign me up.
- When do we start, General?

334
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,472
Tonight.

335
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,676
We're about to depart, Your Highnesses.

336
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,320
You have my word
we will arrive swiftly and safely.

337
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,709
My sisters and I thank you.

338
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,308
Permit me to introduce Fa Mulan.

339
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,709
It is a privilege
to meet the hero of China.

340
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,109
I leave you in her capable hands.

341
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,636
- Stand ready.
- You might need these. It's chilly.

342
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,234
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Your Highness.

343
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,232
So, you're getting married.

344
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,596
- Oh, yes.
- To princes in Qui Gong.

345
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,877
- That's right.
- Well, they must be handsome.

346
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,190
We don't know.
We've never met them.

347
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,398
Really? So you have no idea
what they're like?

348
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,835
- At all?
- It's all right.

349
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,195
It's our honour to serve the emperor.

350
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,829
- And the Middle Kingdom.
- The whole thing is so exciting.

351
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,911
We're very happy. Really.

352
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,389
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

353
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,677
- I'm not sure I could go through...
- Prepare to move out.

354
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,511
Time to get going.

355
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,357
Move out.

356
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,992
If we get to the Honshu Pass
by midday tomorrow...

357
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,196
We'll have time
to make it to Qui Gong.

358
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,633
Yeah. Just enough time

359
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,518
to stop Mulan from making
the biggest mistake of my...

360
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,989
I mean, her life.

361
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,075
- What's the face?
- What face?

362
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,390
- That face.
- There's no face.

363
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,550
This is my face. That's all.

364
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,110
You know I know you better than that.
What's wrong?

365
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,236
- I realise our duty is to the mission.
- But...

366
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,278
But I have another duty.
To my heart.

367
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,713
Mulan.

368
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,952
- Your only duty is to the emperor.
- But an arranged marriage?

369
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
I know, but not everyone
can be as lucky as we are.

370
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,829
In an ideal world,
everyone would marry for love,

371
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,911
but the world isn't perfect.

372
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,991
I'm just glad my world is.

373
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,948
"My world". Talk about selfish.

374
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,874
You don't hear me bragging about
how it's my world, even though it is.

375
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,474
I'm telling you,
the sooner I bust them apart,

376
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,755
the better things will be for Mulan.

377
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,675
And so, I said, "You just broke
my best set of china. "

378
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,718
- China. Get it?
- Did you see the way she looked at me?

379
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,153
You mean with disgust?

380
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,071
No.

381
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,715
Our eyes met and we shared
a cosmic moment.

382
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,236
Just like when I look at
potted pigs' knuckles.

383
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,789
It's love, I tell you. Love...

384
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,154
Love, shmove.

385
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,595
It doesn't matter.
We're on a mission.

386
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,069
No fraternizing with the princesses.

387
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,993
Engaged-to-be-married princesses.

388
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,312
Wow. China is so big.

389
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,072
Isn't it beautiful, Mei?

390
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,229
Mei?

391
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes, beautiful.

392
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,469
Did you see the way
he looked at me?

393
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,391
Who? The gorilla with the bad eye?

394
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,553
Gorilla? He's more like
a big, cuddly panda bear.

395
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,110
- But you didn't even talk to him.
- A true romantic can tell.

396
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,909
He may be coarse on the outside,
but on the inside...

397
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,468
- He's gross?
- I mean under that.

398
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,676
He smells?

399
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,320
I can see past my nose.
Deep down.

400
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,075
Deep, deep down. Way down.

401
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,515
There's something.

402
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,795
Ting-Ting, I think she's in love.

403
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,950
No, there'll be none of that.

404
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,713
Remember, Mei, you are
to be married in three days.

405
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,358
You gave your solemn oath.

406
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,519
You're right.

407
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,397
Whoa.

408
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,755
We're stopping to water the horses.

409
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,038
- Maybe you'd like to stretch your legs?
- Are the guard fellows out there?

410
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,315
Yes, you're perfectly safe.

411
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,755
I think a leg stretch
would be very nice.

412
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,915
Thank you for helping me
with my slipper.

413
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,791
May I know your name?

414
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,156
Now. Dow. Cow. Bao?

415
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,639
No, you must eat.

416
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,871
It must be exhausting guarding us
day and night.

417
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,598
No. Well, yes.

418
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,035
But I'm strong and marching.

419
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,829
Yes, I suppose all that training
does make it second nature.

420
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,559
But I think you, a princess,
with royal...

421
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,030
- I could never.
- But it is our duty and our honour.

422
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,031
Although it can be a burden.

423
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,152
I've said too much.
You are very easy to talk to, Yao.

424
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,152
Permit me to echo your praise.

425
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,472
I find your presence engaging
and your conversation sparkling.

426
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,993
Thank you.

427
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,350
Hello, there. I am Ling.

428
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,079
I am Princess Ting-Ting.

429
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,789
Well, if you ever need me,
just give me a ting-a-ling.

430
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,429
Come on, Your Highness.
You don't want to let your guard down.

431
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,308
Get it? Guard... down?
Thank you.

432
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,594
You know,
I've got some blue blood myself.

433
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,797
Many have called me a royal pain.
Thank you.

434
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,190
You've been a great crowd.

435
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,599
Ting-Ting, look.
Isn't this fruit lovely?

436
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,877
Chien-Po got it for me.
He's so sweet.

437
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,474
Just get your pomegranates
in the carriage.

438
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,552
- Fa Mulan.
- Your Highness. Is anything wrong?

439
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,790
No, not at all.

440
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,510
Are you sure?

441
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,993
I just wanted to compliment you.

442
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,197
You were so brave
to take your father's place in the army.

443
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,990
Well, thank you.

444
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,230
Your duty was to stay home,

445
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,153
but your heart told you
to break the rules.

446
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,834
How did you decide
between duty and heart?

447
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,710
Well, it wasn't easy.

448
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,952
But, by following my feelings,
I wound up doing the right thing.

449
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,476
I guess I learned that
my duty is to my heart.

450
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,431
My duty is to my heart.

451
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,479
Yes. That makes sense.
That's marvelous.

452
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,949
Thank you, Fa Mulan.

453
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,234
You're welcome...

454
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,276
I guess.

455
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,396
Let's get back on the road.

456
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,270
That's my cue to put
Operation Shang into action.

457
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,115
Pretty boy's gonna look so bad,
it'll send Mulan running for the hills.

458
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,319
This is gonna be delicious.

459
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,196
Watch this.

460
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,993
Hey!

461
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,517
Good catch.

462
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,240
What? Shang?

463
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,915
Hey.

464
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,348
Tasty.

465
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,955
I try and I try.

466
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,112
I put my heart and soul
into busting them up.

467
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,191
And what do I have to show for it?

468
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,149
A cricket that laughs in my face.

469
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,676
I just can't do it anymore.

470
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,437
Oh, great ancestors,
I throw myself at your mercy.

471
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,398
My pedestal is all
but a distant memory.

472
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,472
Great spirits, take me now. Ah!

473
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,478
Hold on, ladies.

474
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,117
- We'll save you.
- Look out! A cliff.

475
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,316
They're headed for the cliff.
Come on.

476
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,916
- Time to go.
- Ting-Ting, over here.

477
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,228
Go.

478
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,678
- You're next, Su.
- No, no.

479
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,034
Take my arm.

480
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,677
Ting-Ting's stuck.

481
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,198
Mulan, the rope.

482
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,117
Hang on!

483
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,989
Is everyone all right?

484
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,517
- Mei, I'll save you.
- I saved the food.

485
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,316
And I saved you.

486
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,072
Mulan!

487
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,832
- What happened?
- I don't know.

488
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,196
- I wasn't near the carriage.
- Yao, Ling, save the supplies.

489
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,556
Keep paddling.
Look how great you're doing.

490
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,359
- Who's the big boy?
- Thank you.

491
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,629
My fault?

492
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,233
This wasn't my plan.
Wagon's busted.

493
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,676
Cold and miserable.
Everything's ruined.

494
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,318
Or maybe not.

495
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,949
Old Shang's steaming
like a fresh pork bun.

496
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,508
I bet he and Mulan are two nasty words
away from an all-out feud.

497
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,309
Oh, Cri-Kee,
things are brightening up after all.

498
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,836
- I've seen happier princesses.
- That's the least of our problems.

499
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,999
There's a mountain pass
between here and Qui Gong.

500
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,197
It takes us through bandit country,
but it's the only way.

501
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,589
Why not just follow the river?

502
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,750
Because the river's
not on the map.

503
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,719
It's bound to go past a town and
where there's a town, there's a road.

504
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,313
There's no town on the map.

505
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,313
Then maybe we should just
forget the map and wing it.

506
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,631
We can't wing it. We need a new plan.
We have three days.

507
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,679
- What if we get lost?
- Then we pull over and ask directions.

508
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,196
We don't need to pull over
and ask directions. We have a map.

509
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,316
What is with men
and asking directions?

510
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,870
- What is it with women and maps?
- You're saying women can't read maps?

511
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,033
Women will ask
but they won't follow directions.

512
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,031
...because they refuse to ask.

513
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,311
Am I interrupting?

514
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,153
- What is it?
- Scout report.

515
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,152
I found a village and a path to it
through the forest.

516
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,196
A forest path?

517
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,475
Great. Show us.

518
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,199
See. If it were a snake,
it would've bit you.

519
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,999
There's bound to be a road
that will lead us to Qui Gong.

520
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,036
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

521
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,634
Shang, I'm sorry.
You're in charge of the mission.

522
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,599
No, I'm the one who's sorry.
A good leader is open to new ideas.

523
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,672
- Forgive me.
- There's nothing to forgive.

524
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,512
I'd better go.
I've got the first watch, General.

525
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,919
But...

526
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,270
Are you bugging? Look at her go.
She can't wait to get away from him.

527
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,196
That's no smile.
That's a mask of pain.

528
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,996
That was just phase one
of my new 18-phase master plan.

529
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,833
Now, just watch phase two
when I get up close...

530
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,996
...and personal.

531
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,915
Excuse me, Your Highness.
I found your fan.

532
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,230
It just needed a little drying out.

533
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,117
Thank you, Ling.

534
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,636
Normally, I would say,
"I'm your biggest fan. "

535
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,272
But...

536
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,874
I'll just go away now, again.

537
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,349
Sorry.

538
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,557
I'll replace that.

539
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,396
Of course she doesn't like you.
You're such a ding-a-ling.

540
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,472
He likes you.

541
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,357
It would seem so.

542
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,749
And you like him.

543
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,994
Well, I appreciate
that he's a good soldier.

544
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,838
How can you do that?

545
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,152
How can you look at someone,
realise you share a connection,

546
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,198
- and then just...
- I know where my duty lies.

547
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,793
Do you?

548
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,356
And so, my dear father,

549
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,795
I cannot complete this mission.

550
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,997
I have come to realise that my duty

551
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,719
- is to my heart.
- What are you doing?

552
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,472
- She's running away.
- What are you thinking?

553
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,630
I can't complete this mission.
I know that now.

554
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,109
Why?
Because Yao has given you his heart?

555
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,512
No. It's not about his heart.
It's about mine.

556
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,830
We've discussed this.

557
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,469
A princess must make every sacrifice
for her country.

558
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,913
It's our duty.

559
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,754
The life of a princess

560
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,670
From her birth is well-defined

561
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,876
She must humbly serve her country

562
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,191
Play the part she's been assigned

563
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,710
She guards the hopes of her people

564
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,519
Weak and mighty
Rich and poor

565
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,479
Who could ever ask for more

566
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,714
I want to be like other girls

567
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,633
Climb up a tree like other girls can

568
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,872
Just to be free like other girls

569
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,915
Get to be

570
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,513
Mei. Su.

571
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,160
- To slouch when I sit
- To eat a whole cake

572
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,356
- Feel the sun on my feet
- Get dirty

573
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,318
- Act silly
- Be anything I want to be

574
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,836
- Dance around
- In my underwear

575
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,673
- To run really fast
- To get rid of this fan

576
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,716
- To eat a whole cake
- Get crazy

577
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,633
- With frosting, no manners
- No escorts, no nursemaids

578
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,154
No worries
No hands folded perfect

579
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,196
Like holding a lily

580
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,430
No pinchy shoes?

581
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,429
I want to be like other girls

582
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,557
Scrape up my knee like other girls can

583
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,030
Just to be free like other girls

584
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,637
Get to be

585
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,159
- To speak for myself
- To sing way off-key

586
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,198
Marry someone I've met
Who loves me for me

587
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,796
No escorts, no manners, no nursemaids,
No worries, no hands folded perfect

588
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,030
Like holding a lily

589
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,918
No pinchy shoes

590
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,472
I want to be like other girls

591
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,199
Climb up a tree like other girls can

592
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,431
Just to be free like other girls

593
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,598
Get to be

594
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,269
She defied you.

595
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,635
She insulted you.

596
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,359
- She laughed at your map.
- My map.

597
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,158
And if she's laughing to your face,

598
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,993
imagine what she's saying
behind your back.

599
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,230
Behind my back.

600
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,394
She's a loose cannon.
She's out of control.

601
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,835
- She's out of control.
- Who's in charge here?

602
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,195
- You? Or Mulan?
- I'm in charge.

603
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,955
Mulan... Mulan!

604
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,758
Mulan?

605
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,195
General Shang?
No, that's not it.

606
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,113
General Shang?
Hello, it's me, Mulan.

607
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,589
General Shang...

608
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,638
Shang, Shang, Shang.

609
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,709
I got it.

610
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,669
General Shang? General Hardhead,
that's what they should call him.

611
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,395
- Everything's got to have a strategy.
- Mulan?

612
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,392
The man won't brush his teeth
without a back-up plan.

613
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,232
- What?
- I blame myself.

614
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,197
I fell for those broad shoulders.

615
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,034
I didn't realise there wasn't
much sitting on top of them.

616
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,037
Except for that garlic breath.

617
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,229
That boy can peel paint.

618
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,275
That's enough.
Where is she?

619
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,713
I am good.

620
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,711
- Mulan!
- Why, hello, General.

621
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,597
Out on night manoeuvres?

622
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,910
General Hardhead?
Brushing my teeth?

623
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,714
- Something wrong?
- I heard you.

624
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,679
- Every word.
- Every word of what?

625
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,558
Don't play coy.
I saw you outside my tent.

626
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,790
What? I haven't left my post.

627
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,077
I suppose you weren't gossiping
about me with the princesses.

628
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,879
Did that dip in the river
get you waterlogged?

629
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,838
And why are you talking with
your hand over your mouth?

630
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,559
I wouldn't want to peel your paint.

631
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,313
Changing of the guard.

632
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,437
And next time,
don't leave your post.

633
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,795
What's with him?

634
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,071
What's with her?

635
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,276
Who am I talking to?

636
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,113
How could he not believe me?

637
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,509
I don't know, girlfriend.
But I do know this...

638
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,912
Without trust,
there can be no relationship.

639
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,911
And that man don't trust you.

640
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,831
Maybe he was just confused.

641
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,708
You fussed about the arranged marriage,
then about which way to Qui Gong.

642
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,155
Now y'all feuding over nothing.
It seems clear.

643
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,639
You're right.

644
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,599
- I don't know what to do.
- I do. It's simple.

645
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,353
Drop him like a hot potsticker.
Kick him to the curb.

646
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,036
Burn his letters and dance around
the fire yelling, "Happy days are here. "

647
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,759
You have a point.
If this is the real Li-Shang,

648
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,558
I don't like what I'm seeing.

649
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,550
I hope the tea's still warm.

650
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,910
- After you.
- No, after you.

651
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,752
- No, after you.
- After you.

652
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,035
I said, after you.

653
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,592
- You. I'm gonna...
- Yao!

654
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,558
- Is everything all right?
- No.

655
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,713
I mean, yes.

656
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,475
You see, Chien-Po here
has always had a dream.

657
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,312
- A dream?
- A dream?

658
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,277
- A dream.
- But I don't...

659
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,433
That dream.

660
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,875
A dream of seeing a small village

661
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,077
in the middle of nowhere
by the moonlight.

662
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,674
- How can we help?
- Well...

663
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,070
If Your Highnesses would consent
to come with us to the village,

664
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,676
we could still guard you,
and Chien-Po could have his dream.

665
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,877
My one chance
to be like other guys.

666
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,396
- Can we please?
- Please, please.

667
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,391
Sounds like fun.

668
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,033
Oh, we're sorry.

669
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,553
We're off.

670
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,550
I never noticed
we were so different.

671
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,870
It's like I don't even know him.

672
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,155
Well, what do you know about that?

673
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,800
I mean, I know
he's "by the book,"

674
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,599
but doesn't the man ever bend a rule?

675
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,238
Speaking of bending rules...

676
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,155
You know, relationships are easy
when everything runs nice and smooth.

677
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,629
Nice and smooth
just ran out of camp.

678
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,075
- What?
- Did you know almonds, rice and milk

679
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,071
are part of a complete breakfast?

680
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,720
I'm trying to tell you
the princesses went AWOL.

681
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,314
- Where are the guards?
- Showing them the way.

682
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,515
They're together?

683
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,910
- Together together?
- Don't you understand Chinese?

684
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,709
Hey, what about old Shang-hai?

685
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,030
I think I'd better handle
this one on my own.

686
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,429
Shang's on a short fuse, as it is.

687
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,636
Just make sure
nothing wakes him up.

688
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,949
You can count on me.

689
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,079
Where are the guards?
The princesses!

690
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,274
"My duty is to my heart?"

691
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,398
Mulan.

692
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,157
Get your ticket.
The show's about to begin.

693
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,828
Wow.

694
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,434
Look at all the food.

695
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,309
We just got in
some excellent ginger.

696
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,150
Ginger. That goes very well
with dumplings.

697
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,711
- Did you say dumplings?
- How about some fresh ginseng?

698
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,917
That makes a wonderful accompaniment
to soy beans.

699
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,956
One order of soy beans.

700
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,039
Oh, my.

701
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,272
Who will be next to challenge
the undefeated Shi Rongkai?

702
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,236
- Step aside.
- Yao.

703
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,356
You'll be killed, little man.

704
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,870
Where'd he go?

705
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,794
Yao! You're my hero.

706
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,474
Pick a prize, any prize.

707
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,915
Which one do you want, sir?

708
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,198
Gimme that one.

709
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,279
Okay, how about this one?

710
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,512
What does Attila say
when he walks through the door?

711
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,558
Hun, I'm home.

712
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,479
I give up. I guess I'm not
as funny as I think.

713
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,869
What a cute laugh.

714
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,633
No. I hate my laugh.

715
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,631
What? It's adorable.

716
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,870
I thought you didn't have
a sense of humour.

717
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,670
No sense of humour?

718
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,758
It's so beautiful.

719
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,671
Yeah.

720
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,558
It's the same moon
we see from the palace.

721
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,679
No, this one is entirely different.

722
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,635
You're right.

723
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,154
I know I've never
seen anything like it.

724
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,119
I'm listening.

725
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,633
We... that is...

726
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,358
I... all of us...

727
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,599
Oh, boy.

728
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,433
Fa Mulan, it's love.
Yao and myself,

729
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,273
- Chien-Po and Su...
- And myself and Lingy-Bear.

730
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,112
I mean, Ling.

731
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,839
Group hug.

732
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,994
I'm so happy for all of you.

733
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,037
- General Shang.
- General Shang.

734
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,519
Oh, boy.

735
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,911
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

736
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,116
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

737
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,075
I'm so sorry to break up
your little party.

738
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,833
This is gonna be good.

739
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,798
Before you jump to conclusions,
let me explain.

740
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,791
Fine. Why don't we start with this?

741
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,155
- That's mine.
- All yours?

742
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,674
Or did you have help?
"And so, my dear father,

743
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,716
I cannot complete this mission. "

744
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,110
"I have come to realise that
my duty is to my heart. "

745
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,953
- Who does that sound like?
- Mei never meant to send it.

746
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,998
Your Highnesses, you swore a vow
to be married in Qui Gong.

747
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,878
If your father saw you now,
breaking that vow,

748
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,552
what would he say?

749
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,198
You three are to escort their highnesses
back to their tents immediately.

750
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,319
You are to guard them. You are not
to enter their tents or speak to them.

751
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,472
Not a word. Ever.
Am I understood?

752
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,471
Yes, sir.

753
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,797
- The problem isn't as bad as it seems.
- The problem is you.

754
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,915
What?

755
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,275
You place your feelings
above everything.

756
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,477
Duty, obligation, tradition,
it all means nothing to you.

757
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,039
It means everything to me.

758
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,032
My heart tells me my duty
and I follow it.

759
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,956
You're a brilliant warrior.

760
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,276
You're brave, you're loyal,
but you don't trust your heart.

761
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,558
Sometimes I wonder
if you even have one.

762
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,113
This assignment has made it clear.

763
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,395
We are very different people.

764
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,272
Maybe too different.

765
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,639
Fine.

766
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,831
We have a mission to complete.

767
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,788
Fine.

768
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,949
Isn't it a great day?

769
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,474
I see pretty boy isn't talking to you.

770
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,676
And you're not talking to pretty boy.

771
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,636
You know, you can always talk to me.

772
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,114
Wait till she realises
what I've done for her.

773
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,156
Will that frown turn upside down.

774
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,038
Snapdragon.

775
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,395
Just for that,
I'm not talking to you.

776
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,992
We're so sorry
for what we've done.

777
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,640
You inspired us to follow our hearts,

778
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,632
and we repay you
by ruining your relationship.

779
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,713
No, you just opened my eyes
to how broken it was.

780
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,392
I'm indebted to you.

781
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,554
Keep a sharp eye.
This is bandit country.

782
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,832
I sure wish we could
talk to the princesses.

783
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,480
What? You know we can't.

784
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,238
Yes, I also wish
we could talk to them.

785
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,993
But as you know,
orders is orders.

786
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,039
Yes, but if I could talk to them,

787
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,680
do you know what I would say?

788
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,548
No, what would you say
if only you could?

789
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,792
I'd tell Ting-Ting that she's
the prettiest, funniest,

790
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,633
most extraordinary girl
I've ever met.

791
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,711
I would tell Princess Su
that she is like fresh ginger

792
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,792
on the rice bowl of my life.

793
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,713
And I would tell Mei
that she's one right babe.

794
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,830
Mulan, what do you say
to a little pick-me-up?

795
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,836
My father said, "Differences can
make you stronger. "

796
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,276
He didn't realise that Shang and I
are just too different.

797
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,955
Well, you know,
you've always got me.

798
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,349
The old team, right?

799
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,672
You're always looking out for me.

800
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,432
Just doing the best I can.

801
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,035
Really, I just don't know
what I'd do without you.

802
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,273
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

803
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,599
I can't stand it no more.

804
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,240
The only thing wrong
with you and Shang...

805
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,993
...is me.
I'm the one that got between you.

806
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,471
What are you talking about?

807
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,949
You didn't make the carriage
go into the river.

808
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,828
That was an accident, following
several attempts at on purpose.

809
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,230
It wasn't you outside Shang's tent.

810
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,639
You know how I gab.

811
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,109
You woke him up after I left?

812
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,191
It wasn't easy.
That man can sleep.

813
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,352
- What did you do?
- I was banging pots and pans...

814
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,476
No. What did you do?

815
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,438
You was getting married.
Everything was gonna change.

816
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,432
I was gonna lose you.
And my pedestal.

817
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,193
You got between Shang and me
so you could keep your job?

818
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,952
I'm sorry.

819
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,508
What you did was unforgivable.

820
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,478
But you and Shang are so different.

821
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,439
Wait a second.
Not as different as I thought.

822
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,036
All those problems, they weren't us.
They were you.

823
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,275
I've got to talk to Shang.
Tell him I love him.

824
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,550
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

825
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,358
Forget it.
You've helped enough.

826
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,751
Shang! Shang!

827
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,918
- It's an ambush.
- Bandits.

828
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,309
Close ranks.
Save the princesses.

829
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,033
You two, get the gold.
You two, come with me.

830
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,391
I've got them.

831
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,232
I've got your back.

832
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,599
Take my hand.

833
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,873
The princesses.

834
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,754
How dare you touch me.

835
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,274
- It won't budge.
- Then take the whole package.

836
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,191
Get your hands off her.

837
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,068
Hold them off. Let's go.

838
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,708
Help me.

839
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,993
Run.

840
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,999
Mei!

841
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,598
Come on.

842
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,439
Let's get out of here.

843
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,837
- Shang, hang on.
- It won't hold us both.

844
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,751
It will.

845
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,119
Mulan.

846
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,029
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

847
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,554
Shang! Shang!

848
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,508
Fa Mulan, we're ready
to go through with the wedding.

849
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,718
No. Your orders are
to take care of each other.

850
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,835
But...

851
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,677
Losing Shang
will not be meaningless.

852
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,469
No matter what it takes,
I'm finishing this mission.

853
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,878
Good horse.

854
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,476
What do you mean,
they are gone?

855
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,357
There was an accident,
Lord Chin.

856
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,159
The royal carriage fell in the river
and was destroyed.

857
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,951
A grave loss.

858
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,955
But it does not alter
my agreement with the emperor.

859
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,951
And unless it is honoured,

860
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,033
I will sanction no alliance
with the Middle Kingdom.

861
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,396
- A marriage was promised.
- A marriage there will be.

862
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,873
I would be honoured
to wed a prince of Qui Gong.

863
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,949
You?

864
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,750
My lord, Fa Mulan,
the hero of China.

865
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,592
A jewel in your crown,

866
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,310
far more dear than
three mere princesses.

867
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,876
This is not what was agreed.

868
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,918
However, the Golden Dragon of Unity

869
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,468
smiles upon you today.

870
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,120
And in view of the tragedy,

871
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,919
I will accept your offer.

872
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,959
You will make a fine bride
for my eldest son,

873
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,917
Prince Jeeki.

874
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,954
This is her?
She's so old.

875
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,112
Mulan said she was gonna finish
the mission, no matter what.

876
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,398
- But how can she without us?
- By taking your place.

877
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,518
Shang's alive.

878
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,755
Mulan was right. No one should
marry someone they don't love.

879
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,830
- I'm going to Qui Gong.
- We're going too.

880
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,797
No, you're not. Stay here.

881
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,310
Would you say that was an order?

882
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,915
I would say
it was a friendly suggestion.

883
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,474
Let's go.

884
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,598
Looks like we won't
be a team after all, Mushu.

885
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,150
Mulan.

886
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,394
I would give up a thousand pedestals
if I could stop this.

887
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,634
I doubt even the Golden Dragon of Unity
could stop this now.

888
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,997
Good-bye, Mushu.

889
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,595
My people,

890
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,515
the Golden Dragon of Unity,
who guides us in all we do,

891
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,636
today sanctifies a union

892
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,429
that will be a blessing
for all of Qui Gong.

893
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,115
Of course I want to stop it.
But what can one itty bitty dragon do?

894
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,794
With the tying of this sash,

895
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,236
we shall unite not only two lives,

896
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,595
but two kingdoms.

897
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,240
- It's General Li-Shang.
- He's alive.

898
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,629
Yeah. Shang to the rescue.

899
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,917
Lucky for Lord Chin,
cos I was about to whip his butt.

900
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,515
You're alive.

901
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,716
I couldn't let you get married
without me.

902
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,475
This is outrageous.
You will leave at once.

903
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,551
I'm not going anywhere.

904
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,677
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. I'm winging it.

905
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,832
How dare you trample
upon this sacred ceremony?

906
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,718
Oh, my gosh. He's gonna
lower the hammer on Shang.

907
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,758
Where's the dang Dragon of Unity
when you need him?

908
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,271
Don't bother me now, I...

909
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,877
I have an idea.

910
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,999
My lord, I love Mulan.
I don't care what the rules say.

911
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:15,437
If she'll have me, I intend to marry her
right here. Right now.

912
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,876
Insolent dog. Seize him.

913
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,039
What's with all this drama?

914
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,838
The Golden Dragon of Unity.
He lives.

915
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,035
Mushu?

916
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,430
You dang right, I live.

917
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,353
So you best drop
your dumpling-eating behind on down

918
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,874
and tell me why
we ain't busting out the vows.

919
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,916
But your greatness,

920
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,390
General Li-Shang
is not a son of Qui Gong.

921
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,629
Silence!

922
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,875
I am the Golden Dragon of Unity,

923
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,669
and I decide whom to unify.

924
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,228
My all-seeing eye has peered

925
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,676
into the very heart of China.

926
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,788
And I've never seen two people
more right for one another

927
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,793
than this lovely couple right here,
Mulan and Shang.

928
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,599
Give it up for them,
would you please?

929
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,319
Now, I command you
to proceed at once.

930
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,470
Yes, your greatness.
As you command.

931
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,120
Let's get to business.
Mulan, do you love Shang?

932
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,191
Of course.
Shang, do you love Mulan? Yes.

933
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,716
Moving on.
By the power vested in me, by me,

934
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,076
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

935
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,310
You got anything to say,
Lord Double Chin?

936
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,279
Yes, I mean, no.
I mean, whatever you say.

937
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,956
And furthermore, I hereby decree that
the princesses of the Middle Kingdom,

938
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,679
wherever they may be,
are released from their vow,

939
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,911
and may marry
whomsoever they please.

940
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,275
And who pleases them,
that's very important.

941
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,918
Honey pie.

942
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,550
I can't believe
I'm back on wake-up duty.

943
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,308
Well, Mulan is happy.

944
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,960
If she's happy, I'm happy.

945
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,957
Thank you.
I did do good, didn't I?

946
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,192
You better get your rest.
I have a yoga session at dawn.

947
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,158
And I don't want to be late for
my "greetings to the sun. "

948
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,798
And don't forget,

949
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,474
I like to be awakened
from my beauty sleep

950
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,996
with a nice, long foot massage.

951
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,198
I think I'm gonna be sick.

952
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,676
- Shang, what are you doing?
- Watch and see.

953
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,718
- What is he doing?
- It can't be.

954
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,110
He's combining the family temples.

955
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,713
Excuse me, what does that mean exactly?
For me?

956
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,270
- It means...
- What? It means what?

957
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,717
Unfortunately, you get
to keep your pedestal.

958
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,872
Oh, yeah. I'm back, baby.

959
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,837
I am back.

960
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,594
Yes.

961
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,352
So, this is the famous Mushu?

962
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,198
Somehow, I pictured you bigger.

963
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,838
Say what?

964
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,593
You told him about me?
About us?

965
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,078
I have no secrets
from my husband.

966
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,435
I told him everything.

967
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,398
Everything everything?

968
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,155
That's right,
Great Golden Dragon of Unity.

969
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,634
I still don't get it. What does
combining our temples do?

970
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,598
It gives me back my pedestal.

971
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,195
Wait. Can you do this?
Aren't there rules?

972
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,315
Of course.

973
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,075
Right next to the rules about dressing
up like a man and joining the army.

974
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,357
Well, what do you know?
This might work out, after all.

975
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,469
Hey, where's my masseuse?

976
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,233
Saving China gives me knots
you wouldn't believe.

977
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,478
What about my pedicure?
Let's get jamming on the toe jam.

978
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,391
And somebody heat up some oil.

979
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,029
I don't know what we're gonna
do with it yet, but it's gonna be good.

980
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,554
Does a hero dragon
deserve anything less?

981
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,234
Draw my bath.
Warm my towel.

982
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,471
Let the pampering begin!
