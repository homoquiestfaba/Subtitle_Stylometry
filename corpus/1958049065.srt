get back to my kids.

I can't do anything for you.

176
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,674
Mr. Kincaid, I'm sure
you have your reasons...

177
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,643
I do. Really good ones.

178
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,379
I just can't be involved. That is
a terrible thing that happened.

179
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,682
I hope you get a break.
But it can't be through me.

180

Look, Parker,
we go back a long way.

181

I wouldn't be here if we
didn't really need you.

182

Can we work something out?

183

All right, we got 20 hours left.

191

Get me back to the office.

192
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,783

This was a waste of time.

your things into neat piles,

I didn't mean on the floor.

Are you mad at me?

197

There is nothing
that you could ever do

198
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,968
that would make me mad at you.

00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,138
Sure.

if you prove

that Thomas Jefferson
wrote that letter?

make a million dollars

I missed you guys so much.

The place was so beautiful.
Right on the water.

have something till I got back.

of your presents tomorrow.

'Cause Shannon made cookies.

I would love to, but Jerry's
waiting for me in the car.

walk me to the car?

Oh, yeah. Come on guys,
get inside. Eat.

you hadn't said that

do that much more difficult.

you've done for them,

my life under control.

Jerry and I, we're
getting married in the fall.

244
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,817
You wanna bring
them back to court

245
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,619
and put them through
all that? Again?

246
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,621
I'm hoping we can work it out
between ourselves

247

248

that works.

You have all the
visitation that you want!

250
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,129
I don't want to be
a part-time mother anymore.

two years, Parker.

It's my turn now. I've got
my life all sorted out.

253

I can offer them a real home.

254
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,173
This is their home.

255
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,942
A home with a mom and a dad.

256
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,578
I'm their dad.

257

But I'm their mother,

258
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,983
and I wanna be
with my kids for real.

259
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,153
Not just for a couple
of hours at a time.

260
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,456

to ask for that.

best for them to stay with me

out of here two years ago

for me having custody

341

is that I work at home

to endanger the kids.

00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,528
I just found out that the
custody case got reopened.

344
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,064
- Their mother cannot know about this.
- All right, listen.

345
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,400
If you need to do this
anonymously, that's fine by me.

346
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,435
All that matters
is catching this guy.

347
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,070
Okay, without
anyone to call him off,

348
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,873
I suspect he's going to carry
out his orders to keep killing.

349
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:52,912
Triple espresso with a shot
of half and half, right?

350
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,483
Thank you.

351
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,486
Now, analysis of
the note suggests

352
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,253
that the writer
was foreign born,

353
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,189
been in the country
two or three years.

354
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,293
Poorly educated, at most, the
equivalent of two years high school.

355
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:11,831
Probable IQ, 100,
plus or minus 10 points.

356
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,133
Yeah. Textbook analysis.
Very impressive.

357
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,103
Very thorough.
And completely wrong.

358
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,304
This guy's not a foreigner.

359
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,739
He's been living here for years.

360
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,042
He's well-educated and
his IQ is near genius level.

361
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,779
Let's take a look at
the words on the page.

362
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,216
Let's see here. Umm...

363
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:35,021
One might misspeak and say, "The end
is night," but you wouldn't write it.

364
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,324
Not unless you wanted to
throw people off the scent.

365
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,959
The same thing with,

366
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,328
"I am knowing."

367
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,429
Sounds foreign.

368
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,797
Yeah. It sounds fake.

369
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,777
Sounds like he wants us
to believe he's foreign.

370
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,435
Okay, if he's not
from the US though,

371
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,936
why would he write "1200 hours"?

372
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,038
He did that once.

373
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,906
But then here he
writes "twelve."

374
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,643
If he's so smart, what
about the spelling errors?

375
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,946
You mean "their"
instead of "there"?

376
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,048
Well, most people
would make that mistake

377
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,083
if they were
keyboarding at high speed.

378
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,019
But it's much rarer
in handwriting

379
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,864
unless you wanted people
to think you were dumb.

380
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,690
Does the letter
give us anything?

381
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,892
It gives us
The Devil's Teardrop.

382
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,061
The what?

383
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,829
The Devil's Teardrop.

384
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,698
CAGE: Yeah,
I remember that case.

385
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,843
He was a serial killer. He left
notes on the victim's body.

386
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,402
He did what
the writer here does,

387
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,738
places a dot above
his lowercase I's

388
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,807
and makes a small tail upwards.

389
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,742
Could it be the same guy?

390
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,912
That guy was beaten to death
in his cell years ago.

391
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,314
Okay, you've shot down every
theory about who this guy was,

392
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,183
so do you have your own theory?

393
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,718
Not yet.

394
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,863
Come on, the letter's gotta
give you something about him.

395
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,527
What his state of mind was, what
he was likely to have planned next.

396
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,492
I'm a scientist,
not a fortuneteller.

397
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,693
But you said he was smart.

398
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:47,960
Yeah, well, IQ is measurable.

399
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,696
It's a metric.
I can tell you he's smart

400
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,556
but I can't tell you
what he's gonna do next.

401
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,533
I can't tell you anything
about his character.

402
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,867
The guy is a psychopath.

403
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,512
You can't tell anything
from his handwriting?

404
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,637
Come on!

405
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,371
Anybody who says
that they can analyze

406
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,207
personality from
handwriting alone is lying.

407
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,943
It's like reading
tarot cards and tea leaves.

408
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,545
I mean, it's bogus.

409
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,146
People make a living doing it.

410
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,516
Yeah, people make a living
writing horoscopes.

411
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,918
It's got just as
much to do with reality.

412
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:14,987
Chief?

413
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,669
I'm gonna have to
use the document lab

414
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,228
if I'm gonna
analyze this further.

415
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,497
Yeah. Absolutely.

416
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,768
(SOBBING)

417
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,777
Strange.

418
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,344
What?

419
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,346
There's no tremble.

420
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,782
Tremble?

421
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,650
Yeah, when people
fake their handwriting,

422
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,186
try to write in a way that
can't be traced back to them,

423
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,255
they're going against
years of muscle memory,

424
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,827
forcing themselves to overturn,
you know, the habits of a lifetime.

425
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:31,463
Usually that results
in a shaky kind of lettering.

426
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,300
I'm not seeing this here.

427
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,869
Which means?

428
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,771
Well, either he
had ice in his veins

429
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,040
or this is his
actual handwriting.

430
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,577
He was so sure that we would
never even get close to him,

431
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,946
he didn't even
bother to disguise it.

432
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,582
Do we have anything?

433
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,353
Yeah, there's something here.

434
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,724
Under the surface.
Take a look.

435
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,058
Indentations.

436
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,928
He wrote something
on a sheet of paper

437
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,495
on the same pad,

438
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,064
before he wrote this.

439
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:07,667
Umm...

440
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:13,172
Here, first column,
lowercase "a-i-n,"

441
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,474
then a space,

442
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,810
then uppercase "S,"

443
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,314
then a space, lowercase "n."

444
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,551
First crime scene?

445
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,687
Train Station?

446
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:33,325
Second word, three letters.

447
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,896
"T-e-l..."

448
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,966
Nothing more readable.

449
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,301
Telephone?
Telephone company?

450
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,070
Television studio?

451
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,741
Mmm, it looks like the "t-e-l"
comes at the end of a word.

452
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,311
Hotel! Motel?

453
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,447
I mean, this guy was going
for maximum impact, right?

454
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,385
Big targets, lots of victims.
That means someplace public.

455
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,787
Yeah.
Like the lobby of a hotel.

456
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,631
Yeah. Somewhere packed
for the July 4th holiday.

457
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:05,224
- Near the sights?
- Downtown?

458
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,027
KINCAID: Look, this is
the best I can give you.

459
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,896
There are more letters
down here on the page

460
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,731
but nothing I can decipher.

461
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,733
They may refer to
subsequent attacks.

462
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,601
- I'll just keep working on it.
- It's 9:03.

463
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,746
We've got less than three hours
left. Do you think you're right?

464
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,905
This is my best guess.

465
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,285
We can't empty
every hotel in DC.

466
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,507
HARDY: We won't have to.

467
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,018
Just cover the most
likely targets, right?

468
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,844
The big hotels
inside the city core.

469
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,846
Hope you're right,
Kincaid. Yeah.

470
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,757
We'll put small teams into them.
Tell them what to look for.

471
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,149
Make sure we
don't start a panic.

472
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,094
Hardy, you get the city
police on board with this.

473
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,452
We'll need them as backup.

474
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,987
I don't want any
uniformed officer

475
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,588
scaring this guy off, though.

476
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,025
Just tell them it's based on
the best information we've got.

477
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,827
No problem.
I'll contact the hotels,

478
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,395
have them beef up their own
security personnel as well.

479
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,198
Somebody gets trigger happy, we
get a shootout in a crowded hotel,

480
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,000
a lot of innocent
people could get hurt.

481
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,202
What's the alternative?
We sit here and do nothing?

482
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,380
We gotta get out ahead of the
curve with this guy, right?

483
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,574
I'm just saying that guns
and crowds don't mix.

484
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,710
Look, I know the risks,
all right?

485
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,678
It's a crime in
a federal district.

486
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,681

I helped track down

494
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,615
a serial killer
called The Boatman.

495
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:13,119
He used to dump
bodies in the marina.

496
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:16,455
I investigated the notes he
sent boasting what he'd done

497
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,090
and how we'd never catch him.

498
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,594
I made connections that
got him 10 life sentences.

499
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:27,333
On his way to jail, he killed
his escort and escaped.

house in the night.

00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,048
He was gonna kill him.

504
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:43,658
He was gonna do
something to my daughter

505
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,351
and make me watch.

00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,207
It's clear.

687
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,909
MAN: Roger that.

688
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,613
I love what he's done
with the colors in this place.

689
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:30,682
Get Forensics in here
as soon as we can.

690
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:40,191
Not even a carton of
milk to get DNA with.

691
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,194
He cleared everything out.

692
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,931
Well, that would fit
with the psych profile.

693
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:50,235
Everything he does is
orderly and precise.

694
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,643
TV's still warm.

695
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,046
He hasn't been gone too long.

696
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,798
Hey, this looks
like the note paper

697
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:22,267
that the demand
letter was written on.

698
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,205
It tell you anything?

699
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:31,910
I can't really make it out. Just
looks like random drawings or doodles.

700
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,916
(GASPS)

701
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,356
(GRUNTING)

702
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,759
It's stuck.

703
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:50,738
- (BEEPING)
- This thing's stuck.

704
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,397
Get out now!

705
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,109
He's got the place wired!
It's gonna blow!

706
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,869
- Go! Kincaid!
- I don't wanna damage this.

707
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,906
- Kincaid! Now!
- Almost got it.

708
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,174
- Almost got it.
- Come on, let's go!

709
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,609
It's all we got.

710
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,577
CAGE: Come on,
it's gonna blow! Hurry up!

711
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,414
Move! Move! Move!

712
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,552
(YELLING)

713
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,797
- LUKAS: Get up!
- KINCAID: Hey!

714
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,289
- (GROANING)
- You all right?

715
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,091
LUKAS: Let's go!

716
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:24,362
KINCAID: Let's go!
Come on, Cage.

717
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,235
CAGE: Get back!

718
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,371
KINCAID: It's gonna blow! Go!

719
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:37,208
Go!

720
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,301
We're on it, Captain.

721
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:05,804
Yeah, 10,000 copies of the
sketch of the perp have gone out.

722
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:07,904
We're also asking newspapers
and television stations

723
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,440
to run it as a lead item.

724
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,476
Somebody is bound
to see this guy.

725
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,814
Hey, what happened out there?

726
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,449
Place was wired.
Booby trapped.

727
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:22,453
He must have figured we'd find
the place eventually.

728
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,753
Yeah. Whoever's
behind all this

729
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,757
has been one step
ahead of us all along.

730
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:28,497
But now we have this. And it might
tell us where the next target is.

731
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:34,465
It's mainly doodles, but there
seem to be letters underneath.

732
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,334
Can you write this down?

733
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:38,103
Yeah.

734
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,506
(HARDY CLEARS THROAT)

735
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,141
Okay, shoot.

736
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,211
Lowercase "a,"

737
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,114
"I,"

738
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:50,248
"I."

739
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,349
"a-l-l"?

740
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,351
Yup.

741
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,521
Lowercase "I,"

742
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:59,958
and uppercase "N."

743
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,994
"I," "N" for Norma?

744
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,429
Mmm-hmm.

745
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:09,234
And there appear to be some
indentations on these other sheets.

746
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:14,072
Some are quite deep,
others are very faint.

747
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,475
Another lowercase "I,"

748
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:23,815
with a line ruled under it
and four uppercase S's.

749
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:27,618
Scratch that.
They're dollar signs.

750
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,155
It appears that somebody was
working something out here,

751
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:34,592
trying to put the final
elements of a plan in place.

752
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,394
Why write it all down?

753
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,030
Maybe The Digger is
not all that smart.

754
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,499
Maybe he needs it all
spelled out for him.

755
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,769
That mark on his head
could be from a head injury.

756
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,571
He needs it all
written down, step by step,

757
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:50,375
and the dollar signs are there to
remind him what's in it for him.

758
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,343
Does it get us
any closer to him?

759
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:55,646
It might, if I can decipher
the rest of the scribblings

760
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,883
and fill in the gaps
between the letters.

761
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:59,717
I need to run this
through a program

762
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,186
that would remove
the scribblings

763
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:05,223
so I could see what was
originally on the page.

764
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,993
It doesn't give us
a lot to work with, huh?

765
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:09,995
KINCAID: It's like
a crossword puzzle

766
00:47:10,095 --> 00:47:13,431
where we're missing half the
page as well as all the clues.

767
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:14,932
How's Cage?

768
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,567
Broke his leg.

769
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,203
Someone else is
gonna have to pitch

770
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:19,770
in that softball league he's in,

771
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,272
but other than that,
he'll be fine.

772
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:22,874
By the way,

773
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:24,910
next time I tell you to move,

774
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,914
move, or I'll leave you behind.

775
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,317
I need to run this
through my lab at home.

776
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,985
You can't do it here?

777
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,054
I've been away
from my kids too long.

778
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:38,356
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come with you.

779
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,491
Right now that's
the only piece of evidence

780
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,493
we have to our names.

781
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,529
Sure.

782
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,458
It's Margaret, by the way.

783
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,394
(DOOR OPENING)

784
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,530
It's Robby.
The Boatman.

785
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,067
You heard him?

786
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,901
Where did you hear him?

787
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:26,704
In the garage, moving around.

788
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,240
Okay. Take a deep breath.

789
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,143
Remember your
sword and your shield.

790
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,680
I heard noises and it was
just like the time when...

791
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,549
When he came. And...

792
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,219
All right. I'm gonna go down
and take a look, all right?

793
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:42,520
Okay?

794
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,822
And Janet's gonna stay here
with you while I do that.

795
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,958
And Margaret's gonna
stay here with you.

796
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,160
Okay?

797
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,163
All right, everyone get
acquainted. I'll be right back.

798
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:55,900
I'm Shannon.

799
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,969
Are you one of Dad's customers?

800
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,972
I'm one of his
friends from work.

801
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,940
This is Robby.

802
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,041
Wanna say hi?

803
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:07,112
- Hi.
- LUKAS: Hi.

804
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:12,017
Hey, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

(EXHALES)

806
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:31,136
Hey, Robby, remember that time
when we got sprayed by the skunk?

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

808
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:37,708
The door blew open and Mrs.
Elroy's dog, Chester, got in again.

809
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,111
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Mmm-hmm.

810
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,517
LUKAS: The Puzzle Master.

811
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:48,419
The name
an over-imaginative journalist

812
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,622
gave me for
helping solve a case.

813
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,091
But you like puzzles.

814
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:55,093
I like the challenge.

815
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:57,662
It bothers me to see
something I can't explain.

816
00:49:57,762 --> 00:50:02,033
Like why my son's possessions
seem to have a life of their own.

817
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,404
This must be tough for you.

818
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:11,442
My son was as messy
as your son seems to be.

819
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,778
Maybe all boys are like that.

820
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:15,313
Yeah.

821
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,315
What was the thing
you said to Robby

822
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,350
about the sword and shield?

823
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,686
Something
the psychologist suggested.

824
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:25,256
It's a way for him to feel
like he has some power,

825
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,196
you know, like he's not
completely defenseless.

826
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:31,796
He's getting better at it.
It's a slow process.

827
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:35,166
The divorce didn't help.

828
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:39,804
Something like The Boatman can
have a real strain on a marriage.

829
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:42,407
I mean, there were
problems there, anyway...

830
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:49,814
Well, if there's anything else that
this paper can tell us, I'll find it.

831
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:52,634
It might take some time, but I'll
work through the night if I have to.

832
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,385
And I know that
there's a deadline

833
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:57,122
so you can stay
as late as you want.

835
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:04,129
I'm going to bed now.

836
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,131
Okay, I'll be right
up to put you to bed.

837
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,765
- Good night.
- Good night.

838
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,534
I'll see you again sometime?

839
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,369
Maybe. Yeah.

840
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:14,272
I'd like that.
Dad works too hard.

841
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,241
He doesn't meet enough people.

842
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:22,012
She's terrific.

843
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,348
Yeah.

844
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,749
I'm pretty lucky.

845
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,050
From what I can see,

846
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:29,320
your kids are pretty lucky, too.

847
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,958
Why don't you put
your daughter to bed?

848
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:36,827
This is gonna be an
all-nighter for me, too.

849
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,366
Just let me know
if you find something, okay?

850
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,403
Hey, I know we're under the gun,

851
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:47,338
but I need an hour tomorrow,
first thing.

852
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,340
Legal stuff. Gotta sit
down with my lawyer

853
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,908
and my ex-wife's.

854
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,677
I'm sorry.

855
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,279
Do what you have to do.

856
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,318
Thanks.

857
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,658
LUKAS: Kincaid's
made some progress

858
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,927
but he needs to do more work.
Right now,

859
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:12,306
we're gonna have to proceed under
the assumption that he won't

860
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,832
be able to tell us what
today's target might be.

861
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,335
And that means we continue
doing as we have been

862
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:20,438
and keep everyone on high alert.

863
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,373
Yeah, Metro will
be doing the same.

864
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,451
We're bringing all live bodies
from neighboring forces,

865
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,395
covering shopping malls,
places of entertainment,

866
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,522
anywhere that large numbers
of the public will congregate.

867
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,948
Hopefully, these headlines
will keep everyone at home.

868
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:34,219
But if they don't, we need to
be out there protecting them.

869
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,820
Something else.

870
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,456
It appears as though this guy
was ordered to kill three times

871
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,358
and then disappear for good.

872
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,126
And we missed him
at the train station,

873
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:43,628
we missed him at the theater.

874
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:46,864
If we don't catch him
in the act this time,

875
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,667
we may never find him.

876
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,602
This is our last chance.

877
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,914
JOAN: I'm not
attacking you, Parker.

878
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,584
This is about what's changed
in my life, not yours.

879
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,586
I'm sure we all agree
you've done a fine job

880
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,321
with Robby and Shannon,
Mr. Kincaid,

881
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,122
but now Joan feels
she's ready to get back

882
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:14,759
- into their lives as a full-time mother.
- We understand that,

883
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,179
but there's a reason why the
court gave Parker full custody.

884
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,297
That was over two years ago.

885
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:23,234
I had a drinking problem.
It's in the file.

886
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,470
But I was in treatment
and I'm sober now

887
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,348
and I'm in a stable relationship
with somebody

888
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,907
who wants to have the kids
be with us all the time.

889
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,652
Yeah, but you went on your
vacation without them.

890
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,311
That was the only
time Jerry and I

891
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:34,755
could get away and
you know that, Parker.

892
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,481
And I would have
taken them with me

893
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,259
but I'm not allowed to
leave the country with them.

894
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,285
That's something
you insisted on.

895
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,353
It's actually something
the court stipulated.

896
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,589
I gave up my career in
order to be with them.

897
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,425
Yes, and that career endangered
the lives of your family.

898
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:50,328
I learned to be a
full-time stay-at-home dad

899
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:51,662
and I'm good at it.

900
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,173
BEN: No one's saying
you're not, Mr. Kincaid.

901
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:54,477
We're just
saying that it's fair.

902
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,209
And it's in the best
interests of the children

903
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,578
for Joan to have
primary custody right now.

904
00:53:57,602 --> 00:54:00,271
We have a child who
is still traumatized

905
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,573
by a violent incident
that happened at the house.

906
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:05,075
I have a letter
from his psychologist

907
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,413
saying how important stability
is to his complete recovery.

908
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,217
We referred this to a
child psychologist as well.

909
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:15,085
She said the best
thing for Robby is to be

910
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,787
out of the house
where it happened.

911
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:19,557
The presence of his father is a
continual reminder of the event.

912
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:22,693
We also have letters from Joan's
physicians and treatment specialists

913
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,996
saying that she is entirely fit
to assume full responsibility.

914
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,632
KINCAID: What about the kids?

915
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,900
What about what's best for them?

916
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,537
Shannon already asked me
if something's wrong.

917
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:35,239
She senses what's going on
and it's upsetting her.

918
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,541
Is that where you want them?

919
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,643
Back in court with us
fighting over them?

920
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,011
I've changed, Parker.

921
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,047
I want a second chance.

922
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:44,307
And I deserve the opportunity

923
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,884
to make my case before a judge.

924
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,557
- Now what?
- We get a court date, we argue your case.

925
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,191
In the meantime,
you don't do anything

926
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,793
to give them any
kind of ammunition.

927
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,295
Like what? Developing
a sudden crack habit?

928
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:00,965
It would be smart
not to do that.

929
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,734
I thought this wasn't about
me not being a good dad.

930
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,904
It's isn't. But the
playing field isn't level.

931
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:10,274
Everything being equal, most judges
would give the mother custody.

932
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:11,742
You know I can't
let that happen.

933
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,644
I'm gonna fight this
all the way for you.

934
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,889
I think we've got a really good
shot, but if this goes to court,

935
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:19,484
you know as well as I do,
it's a roll of the dice.

936
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:25,790
NEWSCASTER ON RADIO: Tension in the
street mounts as day three begins.

937
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,725
The mayor's plea
for people to keep

938
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,860
off the streets and not
gather in large groups

939
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,929
has been greeted with resistance

940
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,669
from those who are
determined to celebrate

941
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:35,666
July 4th in traditional fashion.

942
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,668
Anything less,
they say, is a surrender

943
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,805
to the violence of
the past two days.

944
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:58,889
What are you doing here?

945
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,758
HARDY: Lukas needs to
know what you've got.

946
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,636
We've got two hours left.
We're running out of time, man.

947
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,362
I know how much time we have.
I'm going as fast as I can.

948
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,331
Can I help you out?

949
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:11,402
Yeah. Pull your car around back.
And no guns in the house.

950
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,248
All right.

951
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:26,083
Nanotechnology, all right?

952
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,553
I have a program that
slices one sheet of paper

953
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:31,522
into hundreds and
hundreds of nanosheets.

954
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,624
It's like slicing a gene

955
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,225
so you can see inside.

956
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,594
Okay.

957
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:38,596
I printed these up last night.

958
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,197
We gotta comb
through all of these

959
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:42,066
and see if
there's anything here.

960
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,602
Okay, gotta be honest with you,

961
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:45,879
I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at here.

962
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,738
It's a bunch of squiggly lines.

963
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,475
Most of it's gonna
look like gibberish,

964
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:53,110
just let me know
if anything jumps out at you,

965
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,450
any letters or words or phrases,

966
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:55,913
anything that could be a clue.

967
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,848
Okay.

968
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,677
Yeah, keep moving.
This way.

969
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,946
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

970

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

972
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,853
It's Lukas.

973
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:48,358
Nothing?
From any of the units?

974
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:52,029
Ours? Metro?
Transit Police?

975
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:54,565
Okay, great. Thanks.

(RINGS)

977
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,304
Yeah?

978
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,472
Really? Nowhere?

979
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:04,008
Thanks.

980
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,210
Nothing.

981
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,814
Maybe he got cold
feet when he saw

982
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:12,817
how many guys we had out there.

983
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:14,719
Could be.

984
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:16,386
You don't think so.

985
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,488
I'm interested in fact,
not speculation.

986
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:21,391
You got anything yet?

987
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:22,693
No.

988
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,162
Just random letters.

989
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:29,099
SHANNON: Daddy,
can I have something to eat?

990
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,068
Be right back.

991
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,738
Hey. How about
some fruit salad?

992
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:35,305
Yeah. Can I ask you
something, Dad?

993
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,375
Sure, pumpkin. Have you
lost Marzipan again?

994
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:41,445
No. I just wondered if I could
stay up for the midnight fireworks.

995
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:45,282
Midnight? You think you
can stay awake that long?

996
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,151
I'd just really
love to see them.

997
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:50,487
It's so beautiful and everyone
cheers and waves their flags.

998
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,090
I've stayed up
past 12:00 before.

999
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:58,528
Yeah. That's a great idea.

1000
00:59:58,629 --> 01:00:02,767
Why don't you, me and Robby stay
up and watch the fireworks? Okay?

1001
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:05,102
I'm gonna go back to work now.

1002
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,777
So do you think we still need
to go through this stuff?

1003
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:15,179
The guy didn't show, right?

1004
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:19,216
Hey. I don't think we should
drop our guard just yet.

1005
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:20,818
The three days are up.

1006
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,096
Shannon just asked me if she
could stay up till midnight.

1007
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,689
12:00 midnight.

1008
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:26,599
The demand note didn't
say anything about noon.

1009
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,492
It said he was
gonna kill at 12:00.

1010
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,295
You really think he'd give us
an extra 12 hours to stop him?

1011
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:34,799
It's also another 12 hours for him
to set up something really big.

1012
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:36,734
We're not done
with The Digger yet.

1013
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:38,344
Listen, you gotta
give me something solid

1014
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,280
to go on this time, Kincaid,
if I'm gonna ask the mayor

1015
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,174
to keep the whole city on
lockdown for Fourth of July.

1016
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,711
HARDY: Okay, wait a sec.

1017
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:48,879
It's the Fourth of July.

1018
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,380
Yeah.

1019
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,816
How do people celebrate?

1020
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:54,719
And where in DC do
they go to do it?

1021
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,004
You found it. You call it.

1022
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,882
We think he's gonna hit
the Fourth of July crowd

1023
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,674
at the National
Mall at midnight.

1024
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:19,419
Now, I'm just guessing.
I'm not the expert here,

1025
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:21,812
but the word "fire"
kept jumping out at us.

1026
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,489
At first we thought
maybe it was open fire,

1027
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,783
or maybe he was gonna light
a fire to cover his tracks.

1028
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:27,718
I don't know.
But when Parker suggested

1029
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:30,855
that the attack was gonna take
place at 12:00 midnight, I thought,

1030
01:01:30,955 --> 01:01:33,623
"Fireworks."
The kind of fireworks

1031
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:37,895
that they're gonna set off at the National
Mall on the Fourth of July at midnight.

1032
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:40,340
Now, the noise will give him enough
cover to get off a bunch of shots

1033
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:41,966
before anybody raises the alarm.

1034
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:44,268
In the ensuing panic,
he makes his escape.

1035
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:47,071
It fits the MO. The train
station, the theater.

1036
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,573
Those are places where a
large number of victims

1037
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,041
are herded into one area.

1038
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,878
And there's something else.
It's a headline act.

at the stroke of midnight.

have wanted to go out on a bang.

jogging paths, public entrances,

1042
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,814

behind, and targets everywhere.

1043
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:34,318
We'll set up checkpoints on all the main
access points. Here, here, here and here.

1044

Lock everything down, flood the
area with everything we got.

1045
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:40,290
What if he's already inside
any perimeter you establish?

1046
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,960
Let's assume you're right. He
thinks he's a step ahead of us.

1047
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,162
Except this time,
we're one step ahead of him.

1048
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,631
We know what he looks like,
we know his agenda,

1049
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,109
and we're the ones
setting the trap.

1050
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,944
You make it sound so easy.
But if we guess wrong,

1051

we leave the rest
of the city naked.

1052

1210
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:25,074
Good morning. Ella Whitaker,
Child Protective Services.

1211
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:27,210
- I'm here to interview your children.
- Uh-huh.

1212
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,979
Mind if I come in,
Mr. Kincaid?

1213
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,314
No.

1214
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:33,216
Hey.

1215
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,219
I won by two goals, Daddy.

1216
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,121
Hello, children.

1217
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:41,190
Hi, I'm Margaret Lukas,
friend of the family.

1218
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,759
If you don't mind,
Mr. Kincaid,

1219
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,293
I'd like to speak
to the children.

1220
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:45,594
Yeah. Of course.

1221
01:17:45,695 --> 01:17:48,364
Hey, kids,
can you show me your rooms?

1222
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,504
It's okay. She just wants to ask
you some questions.

1223
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:53,903
Come on!
My room's over there.

1224
01:17:57,807 --> 01:18:01,144
- What?
- Hardy said he'd sent The Digger on one last mission.

1225
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:03,880
I guessed he was after that
sheet of paper you took from him.

1226
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,816
It's the only thing that
physically tied him to the crime.

1227
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:10,720
I brought a SWAT team here
but we were too late.

1228
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,221
You'd already taken care of it.

1229
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:16,159
We found The Digger
up there on the stairs.

1230
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:18,094
You were out cold.

1231
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,964
For a moment, I thought...

1232
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,398
Parker?

1233
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,301
Hi, Joan.

1234
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,103
Hello. Hello.

1235
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,172
Hi.

1236
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:33,176
Joan, this is Margaret Lukas.
She's a...

1237
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:37,814
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm a friend of Parker's.

1238
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:40,984
- Through his work.
- Nice to meet you.

1239
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:44,788
If you'll excuse me...

1240
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:49,725
She spend the night?

1241
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:51,227
No.

1242
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:53,362
You sure about that?

1243
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,499
Quite sure.

1244
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:57,843
God, Parker,
it smells like you've been

1245
01:18:57,867 --> 01:18:59,568
cleaning up a storm around here.

1246
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,404
Yeah, well...

1247
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,106
Where are the kids?

1248
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,508
Upstairs with the social worker.

1249
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:08,111
I'm gonna go bring
them their presents.

1250
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:16,085
What did you do?

1251
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,397
This place was a mess. I mean,
there was blood everywhere.

1252
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:22,358
After we did forensics and bagged
the body, I called in a cleanup crew.

1253
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,928
They weren't thrilled
about working on the holiday,

1254
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:28,865
but I figured we owed it to you.

1255
01:19:28,965 --> 01:19:30,699
They did a pretty good job,
don't you think?

1256
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,602
- Yeah.
- I mean, aside from the missing hallway table,

1257
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:36,973
and there's some blood behind the
painting up there on the stairs.

1258
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:40,676
ROBBY: This is my hamster,
Marzipan,

1259
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,246
but it's Evil Monster Marzipan

1260
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:47,283
because it's attacking
this little guy.

1261
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:51,720
These are my other friends
and we're in our rocket ship.

1262
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:53,722
We're blasting off.

1263
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:57,526
Yeah. But it's the morning
because the sky is blue.

1264
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,762
And this is me,

1265
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:02,899
practicing my fighting skills.
You see?

1266
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:06,035
That's my sword
and that's my shield.

1267
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:08,780
SHANNON: I think something's
going on with Mom

1268
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,440
and we might have to move.

1269
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,911
I don't wanna move either.
I know Robby doesn't,

1270
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:19,115
but sometimes we have to do
what the grownups tell us,

1271
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:22,651
even if we don't like it.

1272
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,588
I think Mom's better now
but don't worry.

1273
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:26,866
I'll take care of you and Robby

1274
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:30,326
if she gets the way
she was before.

1275
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:33,863
Just like Daddy
takes care of all of us.

1276
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:43,172
You've got some great
kids there, Mr. Kincaid.

1277
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,209
You've done
a great job with them.

1278
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:47,977
Thank you.

Joan? Are you okay?

1281
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:02,758
I'm fine.

1282
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:07,230
Um... Parker,

1283
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,933
you know that I love Robby
and Shannon so much, right?

1284
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:14,837
And that I would do
anything for them?

1285
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:17,773
Well, maybe now is not
the time to make a change.

1286
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,444
And I'm really sorry. I'm sorry
that I put us both through this.

1287
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:27,216
No. Don't be sorry. I mean,
you're their mom.

1288
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,285
And that's never gonna change.

1289
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,388
No. It won't.

1290
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:38,627
Can you tell them that I
left the presents upstairs?

1291
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,497
Mmm-hmm.

1292
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:44,067
Can you tell them
that I love them?

1293
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,370
Okay.

1294
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:53,876
Where'd the table go?

1295
01:21:53,977 --> 01:21:56,179
And the painting...

1296
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,015
you moved it.

1297
01:21:59,115 --> 01:22:00,926
- It doesn't look good up there. It looks...
- No, no.

1298
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:04,220
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Wait. Um...

1299
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:11,560
Hello, darling. Yes, it took a
little bit longer than I thought.

1300
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,198
Okay, I'm on my way.

1301
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:18,367
Um... I gotta go.

1302
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:22,238
I... got a hungry
man on my hands.

1303
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,508
Thank you.

1304
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:35,418
Everything okay?

1305
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:36,852
Better than okay.

1306
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,422
Good.

1307
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:41,890
I guess I should let you
and your kids be then.

Why don't you
spend the day with us?

1309

I don't know,
I should probably...

1310
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,032
The kids would love it.

1311
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:52,568
Just the kids?

1312
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,171
And their dad.

1313
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,308
Sure. I'd like that.

1314
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:01,644
Thank you.

1315
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:08,784
There's something I wanna clear
up with you, if that's all right?

1316
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:11,420
In the lab,
the first time we met,

1317
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,490
I upset you somehow.

1318
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:18,094
Offended you in
some way, personally.

1319
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,662
Why do you say that?

1320
01:23:19,762 --> 01:23:22,598
'Cause I'm the Puzzle Master,
remember?

1321
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,201
Whatever I said

1322
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,536
bothered you so much
you had to leave the room.

1323
01:23:27,636 --> 01:23:30,106
And when you came back,
you were very angry.

1324
01:23:30,206 --> 01:23:33,042
I just wanna know
what I said or did

1325
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:37,546
because I wanna see you again.

1326
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:51,894
Before my son got on the plane,

1327
01:23:51,994 --> 01:23:55,231
he wrote me a postcard

1328
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:56,732
to tell me how much he loved me.

1329
01:23:56,832 --> 01:24:01,837
He must have slipped it
in the box without a stamp,

1330
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:05,074
not realizing,
'cause he was only six.

1331
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,283
It showed up in the mailbox

1332
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:19,122
a week after his funeral.
Postage due.

1333
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:21,824
I have it. I carry
it with me everywhere.

1334
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:26,829
I brought it to
a handwriting analyst.

1335
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:28,449
And she said
the shape of these letters

1336
01:24:28,531 --> 01:24:30,866
and how they're spaced
shows that whoever wrote this

1337
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:33,302
is very creative and charming.

1338
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:36,739
And brilliant.
No patience for deception.

1339
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:39,308
I know it by heart.

1340
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:46,515
She also said that he has
a great capacity to love.

1341
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:53,322
And that I was very lucky
to have a son like this.

1342
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:59,262
If I didn't have
that to cling to,

1343
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:01,264
I would have lost my mind.

1344
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:05,501
And then you...

1345
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,035
You say that it's all nonsense,

1346
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:08,871
that it doesn't mean anything.

1347
01:25:08,971 --> 01:25:11,006
But it does.

1348
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,541
But you said...

1349
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,419
Yeah, but it's what your
son wrote that counts,

1350
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,145
not the shape of the letters.

1351
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:18,681
The teardrop "I" doesn't prove

1352
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,616
that Hardy was a psychopath.

1353
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:23,819
We can draw that conclusion
from his actions.

1354
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:25,321
Just as what your son wrote

1355
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:30,693
tells us what kind of
human being he was,

1356
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:33,329
how much he loved you,

1357
01:25:33,429 --> 01:25:37,366
and what kind of a person
he was gonna grow up to be.

1358
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:43,306
Paper is amazing stuff.

1359
01:25:43,406 --> 01:25:48,844
It seems fragile but it lasts
longer than almost anything.

1360
01:25:50,546 --> 01:25:53,216
The essence of
your son is on here.

1361
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:58,687
There's a link between you
and him that can never break.

1362
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:01,624
It makes him immortal.

1363
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:04,760
Or as close to that
as any of us are gonna get.

1364
01:26:07,062 --> 01:26:08,564
Thank you.

1365
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:15,904
So Shannon tells me you have a
letter written by Thomas Jefferson.

1366
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:20,376
A letter that somebody claims
is by Thomas Jefferson.

1367
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:21,910
That's what pays the rent now,

1368
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,748
trying to figure out
