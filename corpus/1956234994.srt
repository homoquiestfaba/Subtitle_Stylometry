1
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,084
MALIK: When I was 10,

2
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,152
my father put a bullet
in my mother's heart

3
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,620
rattled off some cryptic shit

4
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,021
about the rent being due

5
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,357
and then he put a
slug in his own head.

6
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,294
With that level of
Jackson-family-on-crack-type dysfunction

7
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,553
it's no wonder I turned
out the way I did.

8
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,439
My name is Malik Bishop

9
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,007
and I'm a professional hit man.

10
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,542
Mm-hmm.

11
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,944
See, up until a month ago, I was
the hardest, coldest bastard

12
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,879
to screw a silencer on a pistol.

13
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,081
I know what you're thinking,

14
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,350
"What kind of a moral
existence is that?

15
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,085
"Professional hit man."

16
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,221
But the way I see it, the
world is full of people that,

17
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,723
quite frankly,
we all could do without.

18
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,659
Some will argue that I'm one
of them, but I digress.

19
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,894
I would say that
I was a custodian

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,630
of anthropological refuse.

21
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:29,399
Meaning, I kill motherfuckers
that are worthless.

22
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,035
Which leads me to
my current dilemma.

23
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,171
That's my target, Cynda Griffie.

24
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,329
Kind of cute, huh?

25
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,109
So, check this, 7:00 a.m.,

26
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,044
she does 30 minutes
on the treadmill,

27
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,647
followed by yoga,
then a hot bath.

28
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,715
Me? I do 30 minutes
of shadowboxing

29
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,251
followed by calisthenics

30
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,319
watching her take a hot bath.

31
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,055
I guess you can see by now
that I'm one of those,

32
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,691
what you call,
complex black men.

33
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,760
Yeah, that's right, I'm complex.

34
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,295
But don't get it twisted.

35
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,096
I'm not like one of
those Eric Benet,

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,599
open-toe-sandal-wearin',
poetry-recitin',

37
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,934
Jill Scott-listenin'-to,
latte-drinkin',

38
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,271
not-afraid-to-cry,
snob motherfuckers.

39
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,339
I'm somethin' different.

40
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,342
10:00 p.m., she's writin' in her diary.
I'm writin' in mine.

41
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,279
11:00 p.m., she's hittin' the sack.
So am I.

42
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,713
For all intents and purposes,

43
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,382
we're like a married couple.

44
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:21,251
Which is no good, 'cause
when the call comes in

45
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,953
I'm supposed to take her right
off this mortal-fuckin' coil.

46
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,622
And now, I'm havin' doubts.

47
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,923
What the fuck was it?

48
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,226
A momentary bout of
consciousness, maybe?

49
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,861
Nah, it was a lot more.

50
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,264
I could trace it back to
when I was a kid doing hits

51
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:35,756
for a loud-mouth
rock dealer named...

52
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,044
MALIK: Frenchy Davis was
the number-one employer

53
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,780
of downwardly mobile black
youths in the neighborhood.

54
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,016
The area underneath
the 6th Street Bridge

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,718
was the corporate headquarters.

56
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,853
And he was always
lookin' for new executives.

57
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,055
If I say I wanna
motherfucker smoked,

58
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,857
that's just what
the fuck I want,

59
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,250
a motherfucker smoked.

60
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,967
These tattoos are shit.
You're a bad nigger, huh?

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,802
You think you got
the motherfuckin' nuts

62
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,404
to put a hole in a motherfucker?

63
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,472
Who?

64
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,630
This motherfucker!

65
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:22,246
Yo, man, you ain't
got to do this.

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,448
MALIK: I've heard stories
from some of the most

67
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,317
don't-give-a-fuck killers 'bout how
the first time was the hardest.

68
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,485
You know what?

69
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,254
I don't even remember
the first time.

70
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:33,390
All I remember was that after I
pulled the trigger on that kid

71
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,725
(CLICKING)

72
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,194
I knew it wouldn't be a problem.

73
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,187
I guess, in a strange way,

74
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,132
he was my first kill.

75
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,468
No, for real.
Hey, look, man

76
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,869
money is time, time is money.

77
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,438
Let's... Let's be on
time this time, now.

78
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:52,342
Please, for me.
Be there on time.

79
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,910
MALIK: It didn't take
long to figure out

80
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,145
that I was different
from the rest of the crew.

81
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,214
See, I took my new job serious.

82
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,751
I wanted to study to
be the best I could be.

83
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,120
FRENCHY: Be, hey,
be on time, now.

84
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,456
You are?
All right,

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,492
you gonna be on time.

86
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,327
You fucked up last
time by bein' late.

87
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,363
MALIK: All they wanted to do was
sit around with the ice grill,

88
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,199
get high, gamble and
talk a bunch of shit.

89
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,002
I guess they thought I was
bitch-made or somethin'.

90
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,462
They didn't know shit
about being professional.

91
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,641
FRENCHY: Be on time, homey.

92
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,576
Business is money, ain't it?

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,177
(GUNSHOTS)

94
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,546
MALIK: It didn't take
long for them to learn

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,515
the benefits of
being professional.

96
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,650
They all had that
G-style of shootin'

97
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,018
where you held a gun sideways

98
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,421
and bucked your arm
in and out as you shot

99
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,823
which was a cool-lookin'
way to shoot, I guess.

100
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,025
But it wasn't really
an effective way to aim.

101
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,994
I called it the "innocent women
and children" style of shootin'.

102
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,554
(GUNS FIRING)

103
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,695
FRENCHY: My nigger, Bishop,

104
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,707
you's a bad motherfucker, boy.

105
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,310
Motherfuckin' terminator
in this motherfucker.

106
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,947
No, no, motherfuckin' Tony
Montana in this motherfucker!

107
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,783
You understand, nigger? You
is a bad motherfucker, baby!

108
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,586
Hey. I'm gonna make you
my ace motherfuckin' G.

109
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,189
Hey, see, y'all motherfuckers can learn
something from this motherfucker.

110
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,458
See, this motherfucker here,

111
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,292
this nigger's got discipline.

112
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,362
Strange-ass motherfucker.

113
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,830
Excuse me? Did you say
something, motherfucker?

114
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,065
No, man.

115
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,700
That's what the fuck I thought.

116
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,370
'Cause if you did, I'd have my
nigger Bishop wet your ass!

117
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,604
Raise the fuck up!

118
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,406
All you motherfuckers, raise up!

119
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,640
Not you, though.

120
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,609
I want you to stay
right here, Bishop.

121
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,211
'Cause you're my ace
motherfuckin' nigger, G.

122
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,147
You my nigger, baby! We gonna
make some money, baby!

123
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,316
MALIK: I was Frenchy's
main nigger after that.

124
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,418
Yeah.

125
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,919
He always kept me close.

126
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,220
He gave me lots of perks.

127
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,179
Everything was gravy until...

128
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,628
All right, nigger, whoo!
All right. Slow down...

129
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,030
MALIK: The only person I
knew that Frenchy feared,

130
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:58,234
well, not really feared but had
to bow down to, was Pretty Nate.

131
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,136
8:00 nigger.

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,572
Pretty Nate was an ex-process
pimp turned dealer.

133
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,774
He was Frenchy's chief supplier.

134
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,877
Pretty Nate was notorious
for being late with shit.

135
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,780
He used to drive Frenchy crazy.

136
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,182
Whatever time that nigger would
say he was gonna be there

137
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,219
you could bet your ass he was
gonna be 3 to 5 hours late.

138
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,287
And sometimes, not
even show up at all.

139
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,289
But Frenchy couldn't fade him.

140
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,591
He was connected.

141
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,192
Ass motherfucker!

142
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,761
Goddamn it!

143
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,864
MALIK: See, now Pretty
Nate's problem was bitches.

144
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,633
He had so many hoes on his jock,

145
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,201
I guess he felt it was his duty
or something to fuck 'em all.

146
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,370
FRENCHY: He's always
motherfuckin' late!

147
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,139
Late-ass nigger!

148
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,274
MALIK: I never had
that problem myself.

149
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,909
I always had a practical way

150
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,502
of dealin' with these hoes.

151
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,416
MALIK: Look, Frenchy, check
this shit here, nigger.

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,085
I know this is supposed to be your
motherfuckin' man and everythin',

153
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,155
but I don't know nobody that be doin'
this shit blatantly to niggers.

154
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,223
To me, it looks like this
nigger's straight playin'.

155
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,625
If it was my motherfuckin' time,

156
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,561
you know what I mean?
My motherfuckin' money...

157
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,263
I'm just sayin' this shit's
real unprofessional.

158
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,298
Goddamn right,
it ain't professional.

159
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,933
Late motherfucker!

160
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,702
I'm sick of this shit.

161
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,472
Tryin' to play me like I'm some kind
of motherfuckin' mark or somethin'!

162
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,374
This shit's real
disrespectful, Frenchy.

163
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,110
Goddamn right it's disrespectful,
but I'll tell you what,

164
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,413
I bet you I get me some
motherfuckin' respect today.

165
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,483
Now, you talkin', goddamn it.

166
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,150
You know what, dog?

167
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,944
As a matter of fact, there goes
the bitch-ass nigger right there.

168
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,859
Hey, get this for me, man.

169
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,341
Frenchy, baby, what's happenin'?

170
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,176
Hey, man.

171
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,678
You know this is bullshit, man.
You're late, man!

172
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,313
Hold this for me.
Thank you.

173
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,783
You had us waitin' out here for
five motherfuckin' hours, Nate.

174
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,352
Oh, see, what happened,
brother, is, um,

175
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,722
Tammy was trippin'
on some bullshit.

176
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,389
I had to take her
to her mama's house

177
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,925
and, well, you know
how that can be.

178
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,292
FRENCHY: Hold on, Nate.

179
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,861
You had me and my people
out here for five hours

180
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,319
over some bitch?

181
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,565
Bitch?

182
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,700
Nigger, now I'm not concerned

183
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,102
with how I've
inconvenienced you.

184
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,171
You'll wait all goddamn
day if I want you to.

185
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,740
What was you gonna
say about that, hmm?

186
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,642
Hey, Nate...

187
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,976
What was you gonna do?

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,277
You know what, man?
Hey, man,

189
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,970
you ain't even got to be
in my face like that, man.

190
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,707
(GUN FIRING)

191
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,319
FRENCHY: Man!

192
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,088
What the fuck, man?

193
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,923
Man, you fucked up, Bishop!

194
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,492
Do you know what the fuck
you just did, nigger?

195
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,762
Man, look at this bullshit!

196
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,264
Oh, shit, man! Do you know
who the fuck this is?

197
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,733
Motherfucker, this is
Pretty Nate Hubbard, man!

198
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,168
He wasn't being professional.

199
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,071
Fuck that shit! This is our
goddamn money, Bishop!

200
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,306
This motherfucker is
Damien Wiles' nigger, man!

201
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,841
Do you know who Damien Wiles is?

202
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,811
Motherfuckin' head enforcer
of all the goddamn enforcers.

203
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,413
What you sayin', I ain't
being professional?

204
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,948
Look, man, look.

205
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,516
We, all right,

206
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,485
we wasn't being professional.

207
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,387
Man, fuck all that "we" shit!

208
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,890
All that "we" shit's in
Divorce Court, motherfucker!

209
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,349
Bitch-ass niggers! I'm
straight up professional!

210
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,433
You're a crazy
motherfucker, Bishop!

211
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,703
We still cool though, right?

212
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,229
Let's get the fuck outta here, man.
Goddamn it!

213
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,398
Get the fuck in.

214
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,412
MALIK: I guess, in retrospect,

215
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,380
I wasn't being very
professional at all,

216
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,382
killin' Pretty Nate like that.

217
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,218
Could've been
a subconscious reaction

218
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,954
to the angst of workin'
a job that had no future.

219
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,289
Or, it could've just been
that nigger's lime-green suit

220
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,650
was puttin' a hurting on
my motherfuckin' eyes.

221
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,494
Malik Bishop.

222
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,255
No, that's his name.
Malik Bishop.

223
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,900
Scared?

224
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,471
Hell motherfuckin' no, I ain't
scared of that nigger, all right?

225
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,241
Hey, hey, look, look,
you know me, Mr. Wiles,

226
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,744
I always toe the line.
This is big Frenchy!

227
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,469
Scared of that motherfucker?

228
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,248
Well, what you, hey, look,

229
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,016
I can hand you
the motherfucker's head

230
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,619
on a platter, if you want.
It ain't...

231
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,089
Oh, okay, y'all gonna
handle it, okay. Shit.

232
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,523
Hey.

233
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,959
Well, all right,

234
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,728
okay then.

235
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,164
That motherfucker stepped
up to the big leagues now.

236
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,999
Hey nigger, you
watchin', you watchin'?

237
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,058
Don't look at me,
look out there, homey.

238
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,627
(DOG BARKING)

239
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,227
Good morning, young fella.

240
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,462
How you feeling?

241
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,555
Sorry we had to clobber
you like we did.

242
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,904
Hot dog?

243
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,097
Come on, these are from
Sali's On The Pier.

244
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:38,832
Mmm.

245
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,610
You know,

246
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,948
I have a meat-packing
company of my own.

247
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,617
But nobody makes hot dogs as
good as Sali's On The Pier.

248
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,211
Go ahead, brother, they're
pretty damn good.

249
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,551
All right?

250
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,830
It's all right.

251
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,223
I know what you're thinking
about, right about now.

252
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,927
"When is he gonna
kill me?" right?

253
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,638
Somethin' like that.

254
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,341
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

255
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,577
That would be a waste of talent.

256
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,769
So, what's up then?

257
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,405
Well,

258
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,209
I'd like to offer you a job.

259
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,553
Wait,

260
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,255
you wanna hire me

261
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,425
as a hit man in
your organization?

262
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,260
We don't hire hit men.

263
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,752
We hire professionals.

264
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,067
Down.

265
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,003
All right, come here, kid.

266
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,561
(LAUGHS)

267
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,774
DAMIEN: Kid,

268
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:48,644
being a professional is more
than mastery of weapons.

269
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,604
You need to be a student
of the human body.

270
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,851
There is nothing more wondrous

271
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,877
or as beautiful
as the human body.

272
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,081
It's one of God's
greatest creations.

273
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,853
You need to learn
every possible way

274
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,621
to kill it.

275
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,077
DAMIEN: Buddy here
is an old pro.

276
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,079
You listen to him.

277
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,413
Remember,

278
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,373
whenever you kill
from this point on,

279
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,741
it is something special.

280
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,578
Make it memorable.

281
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,691
You're not just taking a life,

282
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,651
you're undoing one
of God's masterworks.

283
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,403
That was some deep shit.

284
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,062
That was some bullshit.

285
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,508
"Undoing God's masterwork."

286
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,809
Listen to me, kid,

287
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,245
you ain't doin'
nothing but a job.

288
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,239
Ain't nothing glorious about
cleaning up somebody else's shit!

289
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,985
Now, sit back

290
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,877
and let me teach you
a thing or two.

291
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,921
MALIK: Next month wasn't at
all what I expected.

292
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,534
I mean, sure, I learned
shootin' and shit like that.

293
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,337
But what I mostly
learned was poison,

294
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,863
anatomy and knife techniques.

295
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,644
But to Buddy, the
most important lesson

296
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,304
was makin' a good
cup of cappuccino.

297
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,557
You've learned a lot
this month, kid.

298
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,383
It's about time
you got out there.

299
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,096
Damien hooked me up.

300
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,832
I mean, so, I gotta
get my shit straight.

301
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,367
Do right by him, you know?

302
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,193
Fuck doin' a good
job for Damien!

303
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,705
Do a good job to get paid.

304
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,608
That's what this
shit is all about!

305
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,045
Make enough money to forget.

306
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,803
Forget what, O.G.?

307
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,308
Everything.

308
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,321
MALIK: Damien introduced me
to the rest of his crew.

309
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,889
DAMIEN: I'd like
to introduce you

310
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,125
to the newest member
of our family,

311
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,860
Malik Bishop.

312
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,328
MALIK: They made me
feel about as welcome

313
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,664
as Clarence Thomas at
a Black Panther rally.

314
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,668
Now, it's no secret that a professional
assassin's life is a lonely one.

315
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,070
It's extremely difficult

316
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,838
to find people you can
kind of vibe with.

317
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,241
So, it was cool to
meet kindred spirits.

318
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,576
Let's see,

319
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,911
there was the black
guard led by Buddy.

320
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,282
But you know him, he was always
complainin' about money shit.

321
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,384
That's 'cause I
ain't got no money!

322
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,652
MALIK: Then there was Cisco.

323
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,554
Don't let that
baby face fool you,

324
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,756
he was a stone-cold killer.

325
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,993
He punctuated
everything he said with...

326
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,528
Baby! You makin' more
money than me, baby!

327
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,829
Sala, he was a freak

328
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,232
for that Homicide show.
He insisted that...

329
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,825
Yaphet Kotto is the finest
actor working in films today.

330
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,937
Omar was a martial artist.

331
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,439
He trained in karate

332
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,931
and tae Kwon do.

333
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,145
He was pretty damn good.

334
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,280
Then there was
Vaughn Lo from Pittsburgh

335
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,082
who didn't play that shit.

336
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,850
He was always tellin' us...

337
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,585
Man, I'm from Pittsburgh.

338
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,021
We don't play that shit.

339
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,722
MALIK: There was
the Aryan nation.

340
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,525
They were the white boys that
hung out at the coffee bar.

341
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,461
Last but not least,
there were the bitches.

342
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,929
The female assassins.

343
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,432
Of course we never called them
the bitches to their faces,

344
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,699
or they'd probably kill us.

345
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,126
Who the fuck you
callin' a bitch?

346
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,341

00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,086
(GUNSHOT)

522
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,266
(CAR HONKING HORN)

523
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,539
MALIK: Damn, this
complex black man shit

524
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,108
was startin' to weigh on my ass!

525
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,710
What was it?

526
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,411
Was a nigger sprung?

527
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,115
Only time I've ever been
this twisted over a shorty

528
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,341
was with a fine-ass
government cleaner named...

529
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,328
I heard of people talk
about love at first sight

530
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,564
on TV shows and shit.

531
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,900
But, guess what?
It happened to me.

532
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,769
Well, not exactly.

533
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,537
It was more like lust at
first sight or something.

534
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:13,208
We're talkin' about a deep
soul-searching, emotionally stimulating,

535
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,778
move-through your whole person
until the entire lower half

536
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,982
of your body get a woody
type of lust. Yeah.

537
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,284
Hylene was like
a female version of me.

538
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,087
And since I knew my shit
was John Blaze bliggity

539
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,546
I figured she'd
be perfect for me.

540
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,165
My mama, what's up?
What the deal?

541
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,901
Fuck off.

542
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:42,604
What if I decide not to
just go and fuck off?

543
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,240
You're playing a dangerous game.

544
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,342
You'll only get yourself hurt.

545
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,902
Hurt? What you mean, like
my feelings or somethin'?

546
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:51,971
No.

547
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,075
Not your feelings.

548
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,711
Hey, baby, do me a favor.

549
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,390
Look into my eyes.

550
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,559
Does it look like I'm scared?

551
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,363
Mmm, no, no,
you don't look scared.

552
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,156
A little dumb, maybe.

553
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,825
But not scared.

554
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,361
Look,

555
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,906
my name is Bishop.

556
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,808
Malik Bishop.

557
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,543
So you say.
Yeah, I say.

558
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,478
What do you want, Malik Bishop?

559
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,881
Malik Bishop wants to save you.

560
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,082
To save me?

561
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,450
Mm-hmm.

562
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,652
Save you from a
life of loneliness.

563
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,344
What makes you think I'm lonely?

564
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:40,028
Look here, baby, check this out.

565
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,030
See, I know what you're about.

566
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,499
I mean, you walk around
here like you all that.

567
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:47,102
I mean, you're finer
than a motherfucker,

568
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,304
dress sexy as hell.

569
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,006
You've got your
makeup on just right.

570
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,908
You ain't gotta take
nothing away, add nothin',

571
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,433
I mean, it's tight like...

572
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,012
But, you know what?

573
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,514
You got this frigid
little look in your eye.

574
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,750
And you know what
it's tellin' me?

575
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,452
It's tellin' me that Miss
thing over there is scared.

576
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,644
Afraid.

577
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,256
Afraid of what?

578
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,525
Afraid of lettin'
somebody like me in.

579
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,062
'Cause if you did, you know we'll find
all them little fucked-up skeletons

580
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,900
you got locked away in that
little nasty-ass closet of yours.

581
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:20,102
And once that cat's out the bag,

582
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,394
we'll find out basically
that you're insecure,

583
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,472
alone,

584
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,709
and in a desperate
need to be loved.

585
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:30,078
Look, baby, don't even
bother tryin' to refute me,

586
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,004
just give me your
goddamn number.

587
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,476
Wow. That was...

588
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,490
That was just about

589
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:46,261
the dumbest shit I've
ever heard in my life.

590
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,453
(LAUGHS)

591
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,157
And you were so serious, too.

592
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,868
(LAUGHS)

593
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,270
You were like, "You're
afraid to let someone in."

594
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,905
(LAUGHS)

595
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,606
Mackin' your ass off.

596
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,876
I bet that was your best game.

597
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,902
No, that wasn't my best game.

598
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,207
"All the skeletons in
your fuckin' closet."

599
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,252
Ha ha.

600
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,753
Hee hee hee.

601
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,946
It really wasn't that funny.

602
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,691
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,994
You were being so creative.

604
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,728
You know what?
Fuck this shit.

605
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,697
You know, I ain't even
gotta listen to this.

606
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,666
I'll just leave you with this.

607
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,126
That wasn't my best mack!

608
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,998
Come on, I wanna
hear your best mack.

609
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,705
You wanna hear my best mack?

610
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,851
Yeah.

611
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,388
Wait, what you tellin' me is that
you wanna hear my best mack?

612
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,090
I wanna hear your best mack.

613
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:49,925
All right, Missy,

614
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,227
I got one that works
for me every time.

615
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,552
Get down.

616
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,000
Shake that ass and get it loose.

617
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,335
I can see how that would
be effective for you.

618
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,894
Yeah, I bet you would.

619
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,977
MALIK: The mack
worked like a charm.

620
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,512
You see, Hylene
was the type of girl

621
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,181
that just couldn't say
no to a 9-Millie.

622
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,083
Anyway,

623
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:18,210
that was the beginning of the
happiest days of my life.

624
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,924
See, Hylene was
a government cleaner,

625
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,259
and that was kind of
like playin' with fire.

626
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:27,930
See, Damien didn't like us
kickin' it with the federalies.

627
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:31,099
But, what the fuck?
I was sprung.

628
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,935
Shit, she wouldn't really admit

629
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,303
that she worked for the
government at all, though.

630
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,906
She told me she didn't
officially work for anybody.

631
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,909
She didn't even
officially exist.

632
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,045
Which was actually pretty cool.

633
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,213
'Cause, see, she had
a license to kill

634
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,050
and she could smoke almost
anybody and get away with it.

635
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,418
But Hylene,
she wasn't like that.

636
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,488
See, she had been in the
game longer than I had,

637
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,823
and it was startin'
to get to her.

638
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,293
Sometimes, she'd be away
for several weeks at a time.

639
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:01,120
I'd be going straight
crazy while she was gone.

640
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,233
But just like that, she'd return

641
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,559
and we'd be inseparable
all over again.

642
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,407
Many times when Hylene
would return from a job,

643
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,210
she would shower and wash
her hands incessantly

644
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,345
as if tryin' to
wash out some dirt

645
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,538
that was permanently
embedded in her skin.

646
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:25,353
Then she'd wanna sleep and
hold me for hours on end.

647
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,222
You know what?

648
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,890
For the most part, I
couldn't stand for no woman

649
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,559
to wanna hold and
cuddle up with my ass.

650
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,829
But with Hylene, I didn't mind.

651
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:38,000
For the first time in my
life, I felt I was needed.

652
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,735
It was a good feelin'.
It was different.

653
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,163
She also had me thinkin' about my
line of work for the first time.

654
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,175
One day when Hylene was gone,

655
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,811
I watched this movie
about this old-ass cowboy

656
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,479
that used to be
a hard-core killer

657
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,915
and now he's a pig farmer.

658
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,883
He goes out on
this one last hit.

659
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,486
All through the movie,
this old fucker's sayin',

660
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,755
"I ain't like that no more.
I ain't like that no more."

661
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,824
While these other cowboys
are tryin' to tell him

662
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,393
how much of a bad-ass
he was back in the day.

663
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,862
So, all through this movie,
I'm waitin' for my man

664
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:10,298
to go off and start
smokin' niggers,

665
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,000
and when he do,

666
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:14,236
I ain't pumped.

667
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,771
I kind of feel sorry for my man.

668
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,807
All he wanted to do
was be like normal folks

669
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,744
but he couldn't get
away from that damn rep.

670
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,147
It was a stupid movie.

671
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,715
But it kind of fucked with me.

672
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,575
You ever think about
having children?

673
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,555
I don't know.

674
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,257
I mean,

675
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,149
I never really thought
about it much.

676
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,568
I killed a man in front of
his children two weeks ago.

677
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:47,702
Did they make you?

678
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,604
Who?
The kids!

679
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,430
No. I did it
from a rooftop.

680
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,702
Oh, so the kids seen
the whole thing.

681
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,915
Damn, that shit had to be tough.

682
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,917
Yeah, it was bad,

683
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,276
so bad.

684
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,460
I can't do this anymore.

685
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,863
I want out of the business. Out.

686
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,100
What you gonna do?

687
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,867
Just live, I guess.

688
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,528
No, I mean, what you
gonna do for a living?

689
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,097
I don't know,

690
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,875
open an art gallery,

691
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,601
or teach oil painting...

692
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,571
Or something.

693
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,074
All right.

694
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,355
I wanna be normal, Malik.

695

00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,567
Um,

872
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,036
well, I just, uh, thought
I'd keep in touch

873
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,629
and see how you're hangin'.

874
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:48,876
I'm... I'm... I'm good.
I'm good.

875
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,770
Good. Uh, I'll see you
back at the fort?

876
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:04,759
Hey.

877
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,193
Hey.

878
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,352
You hungry?

879
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,493
I have to go to DC.
On a job.

880
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,396
It's gonna be my last one.

881
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:20,742
Yeah, man,

882
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,101
it's really gettin'
to be about that time.

883
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,113
This is what I
think we should do,

884
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:29,316
when I get back,
we should just leave.

885
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,777
Don't tell anybody
anything. Just go.

886
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:35,923
I got a whole lot
of loot saved up.

887
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,060
Might get a little island
off the shore or somethin'.

888
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:41,753
Live large for a long time.

889
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:45,924
I got something for you.

890
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:49,828
For me?

891
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,442
You want me to wear this?

892
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,845
Yeah, it's a matching set.

893
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,246
It symbolizes that
my heart is broken

894
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,082
whenever I'm away from you.

895
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,450
Aw, look at you.

896
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,153
That's some romantic
shit you're talkin'.

897
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,222
Romantic as hell.

898
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:11,392
I don't know. I'm seein'
candlelight dinner,

899
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,428
my boo-boo over here
trickin' on jewelry,

900
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:17,088
I think you're tryin' to seduce me, Mrs.
Robinson.

901
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:22,503
So, why don't you go
over by the bed

902
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:25,139
and model it for me?

903
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,541
Why do you need me to
model it over there?

904
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:30,035
Because I wanna see it on
you with nothing else.

905
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,513
Nothing else?

906
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,039
Nothing else but you, baby.

907
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:36,274
Why?

908
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,887
Because if it looks good

909
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:43,390
I'm gonna come over there and
fuck the taste outta your mouth.

Seemed like her job
was being cut short.

974
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,135
She had a quick meeting and she
was jumping on the next bird out.

975
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,736
Since it was Thanksgiving,

976
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,073
I thought I'd surprise her
with a little dinner.

977
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:55,442
Now, I don't generally celebrate
Thanksgiving in the traditional sense.

978
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:58,879
Personally, I feel like the Indians should've
gotten their hands on some muskets

979
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:02,349
and busted some caps in those

982
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:10,924
I had cornbread, black-eyed
peas, greens and ham hocks.

983
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,626
But since I gave up the swine,

984

the ham hocks was out, you know?

it was from Mrs. Brooks,

twistin', I decided to do it.

seemed pretty good to me,

home, take my cornbread out.

1045
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,997
Just in time.
The cornbread was perfect.

1046
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:38,932
The greens was still
cookin' nicely,

1047
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,734
but they weren't ready yet.

1048
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,437
You don't wanna cook them too
long 'cause they get slimy.

1049
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:46,207
I knew they were gonna need
some fat for seasoning.

1050

was right in one way.

What the fuck was I thinking?

1086
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,619
Anyway, I knew I had
to take a chance,

1087
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,521
so I went back to the hotel room

1088
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:09,980
with another bag
and got both bodies.

1089
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,932
I knew that I was gonna have to
go check my black-eyed peas.

1090
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:21,201
You don't wanna overcook them.
They get all mushy.

Fat for my greens!

1092
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:26,340
My black-eyed peas
were doing fine.

But my greens!

1095
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,112
I needed something
to replace the ham hocks.

1096
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,481
See, a lot of people like
to roll with smoked turkey,

1097
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:37,918
but nothing is better than cooking
your collard greens with fat.

1098
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:42,055
That's old school there.
Real old school.

1099
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,891
Anyhoo, I knew that
I had to get the meat soon,

1100
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,361
'cause if you get it in too
late, the greens turn all slimy

1101
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:49,396
before any of
the flavor gets in.

1102
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,897
I decided to take a chance

1103
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,633
and get some hocks
from the deli.

1104
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,935
It was gettin' late and
Hylene would be home soon.

handle some swine for one day.

1106

You made a wise choice
goin' with the hocks, kid.

1107
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:08,072

be something special.

dinner with Hylene.

1110
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:17,591
I added the hocks to the
greens and checked the peas.

1111
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,893
Oh, yeah,
the peas were the shit!

1112
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,862
That's the shit.

1113
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:23,997
The greens came out perfect.

1114
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,667
See, I nuked the cornbread a little
bit to get it hot and steamy

1115
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,369
and set the table.

1116
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:31,762
All I had to do was sit back
and wait for my boo to arrive.

1118
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,840

but she wasn't on it.

I called every government
department in Washington, D.C.

1122
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,884
No one ever heard of her.

1123
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:20,611
It was like she said,
she didn't exist.

1124
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,458
I knew what happened to her.

1125
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:28,495
Damien had her whacked and there
was nothing I could do about it.

1126
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,055
I broke the rules and
I got spanked for it.

That's the name of the game.

1128

tryin' to break free of the life.
