And I'll get them
 too, you know why?

569
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:46,746
Because my cruiser is loaded
 with a dimensional fusion bomb

 screwed up my plans.

But this time you
 won't have a chance

578

because you're gonna be in
 tiny, tiny, little atoms.

 apart piece by piece, Bardo.

It's mine now.

I'll take good care of it.

584
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:34,141

01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:35,313
- The point of origin
 seems to be Topeka, Kansas.

737
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:37,620
We've preset the time
 and space coordinates.

738
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:42,625
The cycle is now activated.

739
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:44,322
There's no turning
 back now, Jack.

740
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:48,718
I wish I could give you a
 better idea of what to expect.

741
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:49,980
- Don't worry about me.

742
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:53,070
I love surprises.

01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:03,384
- A solonoid.

746
01:16:03,428 --> 01:16:04,864
Shit!

747
01:16:04,908 --> 01:16:05,691
Jack!

01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:14,439
- What the hell is
 going on up here?

751
01:16:14,482 --> 01:16:15,832
- The solonoid,

752
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,356
it must've regenerated
 itself in the TCL chamber.

753
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:20,532
Jack's trapped in there with it.

[chamber hums]

755
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:25,319
I can't override the system.

01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:34,590
- It's gone.

760
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,243
He's gone.

761
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:40,117
Where is he?
[door whooshes]

762
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,988
- We've lost telemetry.

763
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:43,120
He could be anywhere.

[solonoid screeching]

767
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:19,156

 I'm not in Kansas.

[explosion booms]
 [Jack grunts]

769

Hold it!

[electricity crackles]

775
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:06,333
A Trancer.

You're a fucking Trancer.

777
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:11,469
- Who's meat are you?

778
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:12,470
- I'm nobody's
 meat, I'm Jack Deth,

779
01:18:12,513 --> 01:18:13,950
and you're coming with me.

[woman groans]

781
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:18,258
- I'm Borgia.

782
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,435
And where do you
 propose to take me?

783
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,611
- Run!

784
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:24,525
Run like hell!

785
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:26,179

Hey.

- You've made a major
 error, Wolf's Head.

806
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:40,357
The last thing in this
 world that you wanted

807
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,098
was for me to notice you.

808
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:45,449
And now that I
 have, you're dead.

809
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:48,104

01:21:24,053 --> 01:21:26,577
How can you be the
 son of Caliban?

818
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:33,932
It is I who by all rights should
fill his lordship's boots.

[dramatic music]

827
01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:20,892
- [Caliban] You still don't
 get it do you, Wolf's Head?

828
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,154
I am Caliban.

829
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:25,331
This is my world.

830
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,029
My universe.

831
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:31,424
You have no place here.

832
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:33,209
- This place,

833
01:22:33,252 --> 01:22:35,820
this is the place that
 Farr talked about.

834
01:22:35,863 --> 01:22:37,778
- Wolf's Head!

835
01:22:37,822 --> 01:22:39,389
Brought you a present.
 - Jack!

836

- Let her go!

837
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,001
- Tell me how to get to
your world, Jack Deth.

838
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:44,046
- I don't know how.

839
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,003
I'm trapped here.

840
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:46,918
My showing up was an accident.

841
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,746
- That is unfortunate.

842
01:22:50,182 --> 01:22:55,187
- No!

I got nothin' to lose.

[lightning crackles]

847
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:20,517
Where are you?

848
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,084
Where are you?

849
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:24,347
- It's not where I am,
 it's where you are.

850
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:31,136
You're knocking on death's
door and I got the goddamn key.

853
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:45,063
He would've killed us all, is
 that what you wanted to save?

854
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:45,890
Huh?

855
01:23:49,328 --> 01:23:50,938
- I'm sorry, father.

856
01:23:52,723 --> 01:23:53,898
- I have no son.

857
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:12,090
- You hear anything?

858
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:14,049
- Just the pounding of
 my heart, what else?

859
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:16,616
- Nothing.

860
01:24:17,574 --> 01:24:19,010
- Caliban, is he?

861
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,707
- Gone.

862
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,057
My father is gone

863
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:25,408
and I should feel relieved
 now that it's over.

864
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:26,713
- It's not over yet.

865
01:24:26,757 --> 01:24:28,237
I'm still stuck here
 with no way home,

866
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:30,891
and I hear wizards don't die.

867
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:34,765
They're just metaphysically
 inconvenienced.

868
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:42,120
