like most of the kids in this school.

176
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,489
But someone turned him around.

177
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,117
His 11 th-grade
social studies teacher.

178
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,037
Now I think he's back
to try and return the favor...

179
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,958
and if this is a last desperate attempt
to help these kids...

180
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,296
because what we're doing
is not working...

181
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,339
I think it might
be worth a shot.

182
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,675
What have we
got to lose?

183
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,766
Hey, Dianna.
Dianna, whoa.

184
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,810
I just wanted
to say thanks.

185
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,271
- Thanks for talking me into it.
- You're welcome, Louis.

186
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,440
Can I help you carry something?
Your books?

187
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,609
Thanks. We're not
in high school anymore.

188
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,944
No, we're not,
and we shouldn't act like it.

189
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,947
So I can take you
someplace nice now.

190
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,116
Look. You're not
getting it, are you?

191
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,411
I liked your proposal.
I thought it was fresh and offbeat.

192
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,915
- Thanks.
- I doubt it's gonna work,
but at this point, I don't care.

193
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm willing to try anything.

194
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,837
But just don't think that my support was
based on anything other than those kids.

195
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,507
That's all you should expect.

196

- Hector.
- Si, mi amor.

with these?

There's the front door.
Or maybe that...

200
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,585
Yeah, that's
the front door.

- Well, we can take those out.

for a toilet, and I'm supposed
to do handstands on this?

with some prefab Brahms samples.

I say, "Okay."

520
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,935
Which means not good enough
to train my boys here...

521
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:23,937
but good enough
to train my primo.

522

Santo, s gonna teach you the simple shit,
and when you're ready to graduate...

I'm gonna be

teach you in the playgrounds.

531

was not the smartest move
you ever made.

Look who's talkin'...

533
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:15,781
you waitin' outside the fire station
alone on a night like this.

534
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,866
Yeah, I'd say that's
pretty levelheaded, huh?

535
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,245
- Aaah.
- Sorry.

536
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:27,376
- So why did you wait for me?
- 'Cause I know that neighborhood.

537

And I know about
Orlando's family.

538

- Hey, you know me.

I'm the first sucker in line.

what these kids are?

What does that mean?

544
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,691
It means that if I don't do something
about it, I've got to live with it.

- Take two aspirin, and don, t
call me in the morning.

Wait. It's your turn. I bet you can't
even do a handstand anymore.

- This is a challenge.

You gonna wimp out
on a challenge?

Swim, or do a handstand.

- This is my choice?
- This is your choice.

- [Sighs] All right, Mr. Show-off.
- All right.

Does teacher need
a spot or some help?

560

No, no. Just don't look
when I try one.

- So you do need a spot.
- All right.

but your back bend's pretty good.

who, guess what, turns out to be
a former boyfriend of yours.

577
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:41,695
Since when did you start teaching
current affairs, Hector?

578
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,781
Since you started
piling on the fiction, Dianna.

579
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:47,868
Look. What is going on
down at that firehouse?

580
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,995
I don't think that's
any of your business.

581
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,878
Although it probably wouldn't hurt for
you to come down and see for yourself.

I wasn't expecting this.
This is very... impressive.

586
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:22,820
So the techniques are
mixed in with the dance?

587
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:25,072

Great. They've learned a more efficient
way to give each other bloody noses.

590
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:45,342
Apparently, that's not all
they've learned, Senor Cervantes! Look!

591
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:48,303
Ordinarily that would have
led to a shooting,
especially with those two kids.

592
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,722
Look at what he's done with them.
And these are...

the absolute bottom of the heap!

a small degree of discipline...

597
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:07,573
but let's not blow this
out of proportion.

598
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:11,994
"Out of proportion"?
Like taking this proposal directly
to the head of the school board?

599
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,621
- Would that be
out of proportion for you?
- What proposal?

600
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:20,169
The capoeira program, Kerrigan.
Citywide, at every high school
in the district.

God knows,
if it works at Lincoln, it'll work
damn near anywhere. You shut up!
