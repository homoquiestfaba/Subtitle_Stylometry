14
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,219
Hey, Case,

15
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,640
Is it wrong to pray for revenge?

16
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,730
Fuck do I know?

17
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,810
The T aliban does all day

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,983
long, right?

19
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,697
You think God answers

20
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:34,727
their prayers?

21
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,500
There's a lot of crazy

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,530

23
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,917

the other buddies,

38
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,151
Well, this is a beach front property

39
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,973
you're sitting on here,

40
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,665
And, uh, not too many people will

00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:51,793

42
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,663

47
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,787
Desert Storm,

00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,698
Got your medals,

49
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:15,389

00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,960

51
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,546
flat feet,

52
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,265
THC get out of your
system sometimes Golden

53
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,700
Seal just don't work--

54
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,210
Listen, Dave,

55
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,807
I don't wanna be the only guy

56
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:27,871
in the neighborhood

57
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,713
who doesn't know what happened

58
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:30,540
to my family,

59
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,122
Well, you see how the neighborhood's

60
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:54,898
gotten, man,

61
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,617
And you know how Lucia was,

62
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,368
Always righteous,
always with her

63
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:02,914
head up, man,

64
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,508
After your little boy was born,

65
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,462
You thought she was gonna sit by

66
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,138
and let Juju and the dealers

67
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,806
move in and start dealing rocks

68
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:12,832
on the corner, man?

69
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,805
She was calling the cops every

70
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:15,752
night on them,

71
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,251
Someone on the Police force must

72
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,514
have ratted her out,

73
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,449
Who did it?

74
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,120
Who did it, Dave?

75
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,972
Are you talking about the guy

76
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:38,942
who had the knife,

77
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,045
or the guy who paid him to do it?

78
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,238
You know? 'Cause the
chain of people that

79
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,448
goes between those two,

80
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,318
I mean, that involves half

81
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:48,558
the neighborhood,

82
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,851
Look, man, I ain't
saying that I don't care,

83
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,124
Gabriel, because I do,

84
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,451
But there is such a
thing as spilled milk, so

85
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:57,794
whatever you're planning,

86
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,398
I don't want any part of it,

87
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,246
There are some powers to be in

88
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:04,301
this neighborhood

89
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,961
that you do not want to

90
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:07,061
fuck with, man,

91
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,432
You just make sure

00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:26,853
fucking cockroaches,

93
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:29,970
You let any of them get
away, you're gonna have

94
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,620
to start all over again,

95
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,007
You know why the British lost here?

96
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:38,277
Why the Soviets lost
here, why we're eventually

97
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:40,138
gonna fucking lose here?

98
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,289
Blood vengeance,
They make a vow

99
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,423
to get your ass,

100
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,262
I'm not talking about a little New

101
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:46,259
Year's resolution,

102
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,688
I'm talking about they
give up every fucking

103
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:49,679
thing to get you,

104
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,899
They believe that if their will

105
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,139
is strong enough,

106
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,410
they can come get you from the dead,

107
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,683
I didn't wash Afghanistan off me,

108
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,968
Hey, Dave,
I gotta go wash up,

109
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,429
Yeah, well maybe now
isn't such a good time,

110
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,649
It's Juju's guys,
Pimps and hoes

111
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:07,679
at your house,

112
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,195
Dave, I gotta go home sometime,

113
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,608
They'll let you use the

114
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,764
bathroom at Paco's,

115
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,575
Excuse me, ma'am,
Is there a rest room

116
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,434
that I can use?

117
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,319
Ma'am? Hm, I like that,

118
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,590
Yeah, you can use

120

Can I get you anything?

121
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,209
Uh, coffee, sugar,

00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,003
Okay,

123
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,173
After your little boy was born,

124
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,842
She wasn't just gonna sit by and

125
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,601
and let Juju and a bunch of dealers

126
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,367
move in and start dealing rocks at

127
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,212
the corner, man?

128
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,860
It's Juju's guys,
Pimps and hoes

129
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,632
at your house,

130
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,809
He's not a very pleasant guy, Trane,

131
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:52,269
Now I want the

138
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,037

00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,952
You know what?
Call 'em on a pay

190
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:32,587
phone, Here,

191
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,522
Get the fuck outta my face, Let's go,

192
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,032
Santa Maria,
forgive me,

193
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,092
Because I have no
forgiveness for the people

194
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:57,032
who took my family from me,

195
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,096
God knows I'm lost and I'll

196
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:04,636
pay for my sins,

197
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,847
But I didn't come back
to turn the other cheek,

198
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,405
Yo, army boy,

199
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,948
What's your problem?

200
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,950
Just looking for a good time,

201
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,717
Are both you guys gonna suck my dick

202
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,895
at once or take turns?

203
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,286
Oh, you funny, huh?
Are you like George

204
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:33,565
Lopez or somethin'?

205
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,329
You're like two seconds
getting fucking blasted,

206
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:37,360
son, You feel me?

207
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,461
Oh, yeah, I feel you,

208
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,005
Are you feelin' me?

209
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,675
Money first, How about 20 bucks if

210
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:42,616
you suck my dick?

211
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,047
And there's an extra
tip in it for you if your

212
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,578
tranny friend here swallows,

213
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,805
Man, blow this mother fucker away,

214
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,642
Hey, fag,

215
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,022
Suck this,

216
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:01,893
Mother fucker, Oh!

217
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:04,988
Fuck!

218
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,120
These hits will lower your

219
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,110
score, Captain,

220
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,254
Don't forget to use
the available cover,

221
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,341
The fuckin' video game

222
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:34,165
Okay, okay,
you win, you win,

223
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,418
Let's try it again,

224
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,377
Okay,
you win, I never got to play

225
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:40,090
with you when I was a child,

226
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,692
What?

227
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,659
Hey, it's Zoe, Some army guy just threw

228
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,679
us out of the house,

229
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,980
I hear gun shots,

230
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,698
I'm taking care of this, alright?

231
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,325
You run there with the boys,

232
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,197
and don't bother bringing him alive,

233
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:53,395
Just waste 'em, Okay?

234
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,872
Everything's gonna be alright,

235
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,543
Drive slow, alright?

236
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,420
I know how to--

237
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,785
If the car gets dirty,
bring it here to Paquito,

238
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,371
He'll do the cleaning,

239
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:10,337
Fucking tellin' me how
to drive a fuckin' car,

240
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,798
Slow down,

241
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:14,299
I haven't got in the car yet,

242
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,518
Just slow down,

243
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,018
Is this slow enough?

244
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,689
Is this slow enough?

245
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,934
Can't be my fucking neighbor,

246
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,244
Hey, Dave, Where does Juju live?

247
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,243
Uh, 110th St, housing

248
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,533
projects, Why?

249
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,869
I just like to know where I'm goin',

250
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:26,129
What's goin' on?

251
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,252
Oh, son of a bitch, You brought

252
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,628
'em to my house,

253
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:35,419
That's exactly why I moved out here

254
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,414
in the first place,

255
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,065
Yeah, You might wanna go do something

256
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:40,310
else for a while,

257
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,448
The car! The car!

258
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,123
Check your fire!

259
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,958
Weapons, Fire!

260
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:54,292
Hold fire,

261
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:55,385
One!

262
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,928
Look at 'em go,

263
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,596
Fucking--

264
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,133
What?

265
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:04,227
He's gone, dude,

266
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,520
He took your car?

267
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,472
He's gone! He-- He's gone, dude,

268
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:11,276
He took my car,

269
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,023
Listen, mother fucker!

270
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,575
What the hell do I pay you for?

271
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:24,873
Hold on,

272
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,003
I don't care if you got it wrong,

273
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,180
Get your fucking ass right here now,

274
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,733
Wake up,

275
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,562
What the fuck are you doing, sleeping?

276
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,012
Get whoever comes up

277
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:57,972
those stairs,

278
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,576
Hey,

279
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,466
You want me to kill

280
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:31,339
you, right?

281
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,067
Fucking son of a bitch,

282
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

283
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,030
Don't shoot,
Don't shoot,

284
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,448
Don't shoot,
Don't shoot,

285
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,200
I'll give you whatever you want,

286
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,069
You the man in charge?

287
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:45,612
What?

288
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,738
Who's in charge?

289
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,456
I'm not the man in charge,

290
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,501
The Russians run everything,

291
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,585
What Russians?

292
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,295
The Russians in Brighton,

293
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,757
Bullshit,

294
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,126
Hey, wait, wait, wait,

295
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:02,254
Wait, I don't have no weapons, okay?

296
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,211
You wanna take over my business, I can

297
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,415
totally relate to that,

298
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,896
but you gotta talk to them,

299
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:09,469
because if I die,

300
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,146
they'll come down on your ass

301
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,025
and that's a battle
you cannot win, huh?

302
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,487
I wanna meet them,

303
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,481
I can arrange that,

304
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,574
Now,

305
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,525
Look, this is T rane,

306
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,519
T rane, this is lvan,

307
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,194
He's a cop?

308
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,286
No,

309
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,488
Hm,

310
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,865
I have something for you,

311
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:13,867
What?

312
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,835
50 pounds of heroin,

313
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,800
How much?

314
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,512
It's a gift,

315
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,557
How come I didn't get no gift?

316
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,476
Sit down,

317
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,517
You served?

318
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:39,901
Afghanistan,

319
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,612
Hm, Me, too,

320
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,739
I wanna do business with you, Ivan,

321
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,673
This smack is to show you that I'm

322
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:47,434
on the level,

323
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,996
We already have a supplier in there,

324
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,700
Who? T errorists?,
Warlords?

325
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,760
I get my shit directly
from the NATO impound

326
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,350
and I get a lot of it,

327
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,596
I have to discuss it with Sergei,

328
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,682
Sergei?

329
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,078
I thought you were the one

330
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:13,043
calling the shots,

331
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,422
As far as you're concerned,

332
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:16,938
I call the shots,

333
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,110
Don't hurt our new friend, Juju,

334
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,196
He's a war hero, you know,

335
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,837
Maybe you can show him

336
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:27,733
a good time,

337
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,994
Trane, give us a minute, okay?

338
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,495
If he has any heroin, find it

339
00:23:41,595 --> 00:23:42,797
and kill him,

340
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,053
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,430
I'm taking them all down,

342
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,764
You want some advice?

343
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:00,851
Just get outta here,
There ain't nothing

344
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:01,841
left for you here,

345
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,110
Go back to Afghanistan, kill

346
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,904
some Saudis, whatever,

347
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,219
'Cause you're turning this place

348
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,389
into a war zone,

349
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,204
It already is a war zone, Dave,

350
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,934
Hey, Caridad,

351
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,145
If you don't mind,

352
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,813
No problem,

353
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,064
Good to see you, honey,

354
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,151
Hey, look who's coming,

355
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,195
The most beautiful woman in the world,

356
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,454
My pride and joy,

357
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,887
Caridad, I want you to meet my

358
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,666
new friend, T rencito,

359
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,204
It's good to meet you

360
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:47,547
Pleasure,

361
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,970
Baby,

362
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,214
give us a minute,

363
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:59,726
Sure, daddy,

364
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,760
This is bullshit,
I though I was

365
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,881
gonna meet your boss,

366
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,726
Ivan's my boss,

367
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:10,312
That's as far up the chain as I go,

368
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,778
Take it, easy, kiddo,

369
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:14,099
take it easy, Huh?

370
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:18,161
We got time, man,
Plenty of time,

371
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:21,106
Enjoy your piece of
the pie and everything

372
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,626
will work itself out,

373
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,745
Pst, pst, pst,

374
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:30,415
I got something for you,

375
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,759
You're gonna like it,

376
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,819
Juju's present,

377
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,504
My office is waiting

378
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:09,529
for you, gentlemen,

379
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,630
No problem,

380
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,010
I could butter her muffin,

381
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,629
Y eah, I could, too,

382
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:18,722
Holy mackerel,

383
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:19,973
I'd butter her face,

384
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,236
Maybe we could go someplace

385
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,336
more private?

386
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,112
Okay,

387
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,283
Thanks again for the car,

388
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,322
Ha, ha, ha,
very fucking funny,

389
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:44,914
I hope you like genital warts,

390
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,632
That bitch got a crab,

391
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,876
shrimp, lobster,

392
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,203
the whole seafood planet in that ass,

393
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:52,394
Not that I know of, you
know, just what I've

394
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,490
heard on the streets,

395
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,841
You know what I'm saying?

396
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,659
What you looking at?

397
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,703
I'm looking at you,

398
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,470
Uh, I like to watch,

399
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,016
So just lay back and do your thing,

400
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,761
and I'm gonna do my thing,

401
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:52,440
But I don't like anybody to see me,

402
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,608
Okay?

403
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,736
Okay,

404
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,736
Oh,

405
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:06,454
Oh, yeah,

406
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,572

00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:09,332
Oh, yeah,

408
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,959
Just like that,

409
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,954
Oh, yes,

410
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,455
Don't stop,

411
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:16,840
Oh, yes,

412
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:17,924
Don't stop,

413
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,844
Oh, yeah,
Oh, yeah,

414
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:25,257
Oh, yes, Oh, yes,

415
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:29,561
Oh! Oh!

00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:33,189
Oh, oh, oh,

417
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,344
Well, you gotta give
us some upfront, I ain't

418
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,004
gonna do this on faith,

419
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,989
We gotta get paid upfront, comprende?

420
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,098
Make sure you find
out where he's keepin'

421
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,267
the heroin, alright?

422
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,704
How we gonna do that if we kill 'em?

423
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,917
Find it out before you kill him,

424
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,930
Where is this fuckin' spic?

425
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,285
What do you think you're doing?

426
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,831
You don't fuck with someone like Juju,

427
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,962
How do you think that's funny?

428
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,256
He's sending his boys
over here right now,

429
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,968
Did you tell 'em you're my sister?

430
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,338
I'm not stupid,

431
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:48,248
I'm just trying to help

432
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,349
you, Gabriel,

433
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,233
I'm not a little girl anymore,

434
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,061
Yeah,

435
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,405
I can see that,

436
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:10,662
What was I supposed to do?

437
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,123
Juju protects me,

438
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,089
Okay, Fine,

439
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,877
I'm the screw up,

440
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:29,431
I don't wanna see you get hurt,

441
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,058
Just stay out of my way,

442
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,611
Why don't we take a break?
We'll go get a freebie

443
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:49,851
from one of Juju's girls,

444
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,571
Tommy,

445
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:55,782
what the fuck is wrong with you?

446
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:58,501
I know this may sound weird to you,

447
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:01,576
every once in a while
we actually gotta do

448
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:03,089
our job, you know?

449
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:08,628
It ain't all about booze and whores,

450
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:11,639
Alright, You're right, I'm sorry,

451
00:32:17,863 --> 00:32:19,283
Were you boys looking

452
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:20,523
for some smack?

453
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,362
We might be,
How much you got?

454
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,447
A lot,

455
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,159
Where is it?

456
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,623
I tell you where it
is, then you kill me,

457
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:34,688
I don't think so,

458
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,373
Oh, Come on, man,

459
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,659
What do you think this is?

460
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,440
We're cops,
You think we're

461
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,163

462
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,099
We ain't gonna kill ya, Come on, get in

463
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,116
the back of the car,

464
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:49,260
Take us to it,

465
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,055
Come on, we'll give
you a beer, Come on,

466
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,133
Take a small ride,

467
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,644
You got our word,

468
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,356
Okay,

469
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,981
I live near Brighton beach,

470
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:12,867
Good, Have a beer,

471
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,336
So, Trane,

472
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:32,817
How come you guys couldn't

473
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:33,747
get Bin Laden?

474
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,433
We needed more guys,

475
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,227
You needed more guys?

476
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:43,515
Should've, could've,
would've, Hm?

477
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:46,785
Maybe you two could
teach me a little something

478
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:48,305
about honor and duty,

479
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,357
Honor and duty, huh?

480
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:54,068
You keep those fucking words

481
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,185
out of your mouth,

482
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,902
I'm about 10 seconds from dumping

483
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,063
your ass in the guano,

484
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,664
Wait until we get this shit,

485
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,575
He's diggin' all day,

486
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,860
Go finish your fucking
donut, You threw it on

487
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,028
the ground over there,

488
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,963
I found it,

489
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,383
Get the fuck out,
Move! Move!

490
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,213
Where is it?
You got it?

491
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,640
I don't see anything,
What's he talking about?

492
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,018
Hey, Trane, where is it?
I don't see anything,

493
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,554
Hey!

494
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:25,148
You son of a bitch,

495
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:28,026
Shit,

496
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:00,809
Shit,

497
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,488
Jesus,

498
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,206
Ritchie,

499
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,924
Richie,

500
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,510
Aw, Jesus,

501
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:09,002
AIright, Where's my drugs?

502
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,587
You didn't get it?

503
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:11,878
No, Of course

504
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:12,739
I didn't get it,

505
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,539
I gave it to Juju's boys,

506
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,919
Blitzer and McKern,

507
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,970
No better bag man than the NYPD,

508
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,638
How come you didn't bring it?

509
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,513
I'm not gonna walk down the street

510
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,833
with 50 pounds of smack,

511
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,845
Smart,

512
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:29,064
How you getting along with Juju?

513
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,483
He said you had
trouble with the police,

514
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:33,518
That's bullshit,

515
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:35,640
He said when the cops
take you down he'd be

516
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,972
happy to buy my shipments,

517
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,372
Juju's a snake,
I'll prove it to

518
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:40,408
you tomorrow,

519
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,542
Fuck,

520
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,556
I'm the daddy here,

521
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:10,772
Let's make a toast,

522
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:14,393
T o T rane, Huh?

523
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:17,278
May he rot in fucking hell,

524
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,322
That's a good toast,

525
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,957
You girls celebrating something?

526
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,050
What's the occasion?

527
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,386
Why wasn't I invited?

528
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:44,472
I thought you'd be busy,

529
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:46,683
I was busy,

530
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:50,804
I ran into your boys,
Blitzer and McKern,

531
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:54,941
They seemed pretty
interested in my heroin,

532
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,609
What about you?

533
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,695
You wanna buy it?

534
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,241
Yes,

535
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:06,036
Half a million,

536
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:12,326
Or I could just give it to lvan,

537
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:14,502
I'll buy it,

538
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:19,257
You know the air strip
at Floyd Bennett?

539
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,844
Yes? No?

540
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:27,474
Tomorrow, 11:00 AM,

541
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,824
When do I get to meet Sergei?

542
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:54,650
You don't need to meet him,

543
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,819
you deal with me,

544
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,112
I cannot believe

545
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:01,966
that Juju thinks he can steal my drugs,

546
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,329
Juju must be the dumbest mother

547
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:05,929
fucker on the planet,

548
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,975
Don't touch it,

549
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,436
What is it?

550
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:18,233
That's where we melt down the bodies,

551
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,319
This will be Juju's new home,

552
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,781
We going golfing?

553
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,493
Where is he gonna be?

554
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,954
Right over here in the middle of

555
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:52,844
this runway,

556
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:13,455
Oh, No it's bad for me,

557
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,100
They're gonna come from the entrance

558
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,410
road on the right,

559
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,132
Actually,

560
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:35,594
I don't like killing with a gun,

561
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:36,558
It saves a

562
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:37,420
Iot of the mess,

563
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,688
You know,
gun takes the

564
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,141
fun out of it,

565
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:44,652
I prefer with a knife,

566
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:49,157
Up close, in person,

567
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,163
AIthough Sergei tells me who to kill,

568
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:58,375
but how to kill is my business,

569
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,295
Can't wait to meet this guy,

570
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,679
Car's approaching,

571
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,639
There she is,

572
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:43,378
Fuck,

573
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,596
Shit,

574
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:09,279
You gotta find that girl,
Okay? Bring in the girl,

575
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,488
We have his girl at the safe house,

576
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:55,283
The safe house,

577
00:42:55,408 --> 00:43:00,622
Girl, girl, girl,
Get me the phone,

578
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,090
Alright,
Alright,

579
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,211
Alright,

580
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,572
Hey, man,
you've reached

581
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:18,014
Juju's voice mail,

582
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:20,217
Unfortunately, he is unable to take

583
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:20,875
your call,

584
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:24,622
But if you leave him
a message, probably, he

585
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:26,564
might get back to you,

586
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,630
Parlamo italiano,
se habla espanol,

587
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:35,580
J uju, if you wanna see

588
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,701
your girl again,

589
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:40,052

590
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:41,204
fucking heroin!

591
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,740
If Juju wants her back he's gonna try

592
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,947
to take her by force,

593
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,299
Then we'll kill her,

594
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:56,678
How many guys do you have watching her?

595
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:57,887
Three,

596
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:58,930
That's it?

597
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:03,476
What? Is that enough?,

598
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:11,810
Yuri, go check up on them, with him,

599
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,486
Please,

600
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:46,503
Hey, Yuri, Why don't
you go down to the corner

601
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:47,754
and get us some coffee?

602
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:49,147
It's gonna be a long night,

603
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:52,817
Oh, I get coffee,
Okay, Sounds good,

604
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:08,333
Yuri went back to lvan's,

605
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,599
Where's the girl?

606
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:26,434
None of your business,

607
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,939
Tisk,

608
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,315
Five balls,

609
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,026
That's not a shot,

610
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:36,820
I can make it,

611
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:38,780
Right,

612
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:44,869

613
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,351

00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,837

623
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,032

I've always liked about you, Juju?

698
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:34,135
You have good fashion sense,

00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,462
What?

700
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:37,422

00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,607
Hey, Hey,

00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,577
Relax, Relax, Hm?

713
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:03,913
Are you gonna tell me where

714
00:52:04,013 --> 00:52:04,608
my wife is?

715
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,284
How should I know?

716
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,829
Listen,
Do it,

717
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,831
Do it,

718
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,181
I'm going to pretend we never tried to

719
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:14,200
kill each other,

720
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,886
Or set each other up, or anything,

721
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:18,890
Man, I just want you to tell me

722
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,998
where my wife is,

723
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:21,766
Then I'll let you go,

724
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,666
And you can crawl back to

725
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:24,519
Afghanistan

726
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:27,694
or to whatever other shit hole

727
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:29,190
you came from,

728
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:30,817
How's that sound, bro?

729
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:32,777
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

730
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:34,942
He just cursed at you,

731
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:36,322

732
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,650
Do it, you fuckin' pussy,

He just called you a pussy,

00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:40,977
man, Do it,

735
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,658
Stab 'em already

736
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:49,299
I'm cutting you piece by
piece and the only thing I'm

737
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,695
gonna leave is your tongue,

738
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:52,312
'Cause you're gonna be begging

739
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:52,989
to tell me--

740
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:54,617
Why don't you stop talking and

741
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:55,825
just do it, you fagot,

742
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,878
Do it, Stab 'em already,

743
00:52:57,978 --> 00:52:59,652
You heard 'em,
fuckin' do it, man,

744
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:00,538
He's asking you,

745
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:01,958
What the fuck is wrong with

746
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:03,124
you? Shut up! Huh?,

747
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:05,268
I'm about to carve your eyes out,

748
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,479
So do it already!

749
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:09,856
She's my wife,
for Christ's sakes,

750
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:15,612
Pussy,

That's juicy, right?

752
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,905
Talk already, Talk!

753
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:31,536
I told you I wasn't lying,

754
00:53:31,636 --> 00:53:33,705
T ell me where she is,

755
00:53:33,805 --> 00:53:35,882
Stab his other eye, already,

756
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:42,263
Oh, man, Look at his fucking eyeballs,

757
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:46,885
You can't see his eyeballs,

758
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:58,397
You're making people sick, Here,

759
00:53:58,497 --> 00:54:01,199
He's vomiting because
of your fucking eyes,

760
00:54:01,324 --> 00:54:02,826
There you go,

761
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:04,786
The fucker's puking' because of you,

762
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,980
Come on, man, this is embarrassing,

763
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,898
You're puking like a little girl,

764
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:35,191
He doesn't know shit,

765
00:54:35,316 --> 00:54:36,901
He knows, man,
He fucking knows,

766
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:38,307
Fuck you,
He doesn't

767
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:39,014
know shit,

768
00:54:39,114 --> 00:54:41,156
I just poked his eyes out,

769
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,985
But now I say we get serious

770
00:54:43,085 --> 00:54:44,351

771
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,218

772
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:46,144

773
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:48,924

00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,576
You want me to fucking hold your

778
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:04,079
hair back or something?

779
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,848
Ah, man!

780
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:10,635
Hey, yo!
He's gone, man,

781
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:11,728
He's gone!

782
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,273
What do you mean he's gone?

783
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:17,184
He cannot be gone,

784
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:18,234
He's gone, dude,

785
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,236
He's around here somewhere,

786
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,452
I don't know where he went, man,

787
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,321
Hurry up, he's not gonna go too far,

788
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:31,100
You wanna make me go into the jungle

789
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,399
with my new jacket, man?

790
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,380
Dude, this is my new
jacket, I don't wanna go

791
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,028
into the fucking jungle,

792
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:39,401
Where the hell did he go, man?

793
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:40,757
The mother fucker,

794
00:55:40,882 --> 00:55:42,494
You never know with these guys in

795
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:43,702
the military, you know,

796
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,096
Hope there's no snakes, man,

797
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,078
He cannot go too far,

798
00:55:51,178 --> 00:55:52,052
He's blind,

799
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,690
There'd better be no fuckin'

800
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:06,790
snakes in here,

801
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,042
Promise me one thing,

802
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:57,284
Is it wrong to pray for revenge?

803
00:56:57,384 --> 00:56:59,294
Fuck do I know?

804
00:57:02,505 --> 00:57:05,300
Look around you, man,
Is this what you want?

805
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:10,472
Send me back,

806
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,581
Dave!

807
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,536
Dave!

808
00:59:04,636 --> 00:59:05,879
Gabriel!

809
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,382
Are you okay?

810
00:59:12,635 --> 00:59:15,547
One more time,

811
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:18,475
Right,

812
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,684
We're there,
Back up,

813
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:20,810
I got it,

814
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,818
Dave,

815
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:31,780
Can you make a phone call for me?

816
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:36,868
You know where I buried my bag?

817
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:38,445
Yeah,

818
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,580
What do you need your bag for?

819
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:44,709
I need to get to Sergei's,

820
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,975
No, dude, You need to
get to a hospital, man,

821
00:59:47,075 --> 00:59:48,071
you're all assed out,

822
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:50,256
Just give me my bag,

823
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:52,217
Please,

824
00:59:58,223 --> 00:59:59,424
Towel,

825
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:04,729
Ivan, It's me, Trane,

826
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:07,933
You went for them, huh?

827
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:10,153
Yeah, But I got Juju and Antwan

828
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:11,463
coming to kill me,

829
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:20,787
Okay, Antwan,

830
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:23,832
Stay put, here,

831
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,167
Try not to touch anything,

832
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:28,378
Keep your eyes on the road,

833
01:00:28,503 --> 01:00:31,214
You've said it once,
I heard you, Okay,

834
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:33,319
Keep your eyes on the road in

835
01:00:33,419 --> 01:00:34,699
case the cops come,

836
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:37,095
Alright?

837
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:42,100
"Don't touch anything--

838
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:44,217
You said it three--
The first time I heard

839
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:45,462
you it was fucking fine,

840
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,032
The third time was too fucking much,

841
01:00:48,132 --> 01:00:49,272
Come on! Damn it,

842
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,117
"Don't touch-- The fucking thing's

843
01:01:14,217 --> 01:01:15,242
broken, It's broken,

844
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,669
"Don't touch anything,"

845
01:01:17,769 --> 01:01:19,804
"Don't touch it, "

846
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:28,930
Gabriel!

847
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,522
Above!

848
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,198
The man's just above,

849
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,543
Come on, man,

850
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:34,662
Pick up the phone,

851
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:35,902
Juju, Pick it up,

852
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:41,858
Oh!

853
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:48,337
If you leave a message,

854
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:50,420
probably, he might get back to you,

855
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,242
Oh!

856
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:13,355
Oh! Whoa,

857
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:14,336
Hold it, man,

858
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,475
Whoa, whoa,
Hey, I'm right here,

859
01:03:17,575 --> 01:03:19,799
I'm right here, Listen!

860
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,879
Relax, man,
I'm married

861
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:30,835
to your sister,

862
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:33,172
That has to mean something,

863
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:34,464
for Christ's sakes,

864
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,275
Maybe next lifetime,

865
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:44,608
Yo!

866
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,868
Yo,

867
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:57,212
Jesus Christ, man,

868
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:59,130
I'm fine,

869
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:06,672
[Don't fucking move!

870
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:07,764
Where's Juju?

871
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,391
He's dead,
Where's Antwan?

872
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,074
I blew his fucking head off, What

873
01:04:11,174 --> 01:04:12,294
happened to your face?

874
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:13,853
Let's get 'em over to lvan's,

875
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,812
Ivan,

876
01:04:21,912 --> 01:04:25,991
Trane, You got the smack?

877
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:34,290
Yeah,

878
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,663
Good,

879
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:43,508
Good,

880
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:07,532
Throw your bag in the trunk,

881
01:05:27,552 --> 01:05:29,685
You know, I don't want to

882
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:31,298
sound sentimental,

883
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:33,516
It's funny,

884
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:35,240
You and I were both soldiers

885
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,586
before in Afghanistan,

886
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:39,525
And now we're here, another

887
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,600
war zone, Rockaway,

888
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,860
where you have to kill to survive

889
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:47,314
kill to win,
kill to stay strong,

890
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:52,577
I never enjoyed killing,

891
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:57,824
I used to be like you,

892
01:05:57,924 --> 01:06:03,121
Until it all changes,
in Afghanistan,

893
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:06,002
We got an order,
we had to wipe out

894
01:06:06,102 --> 01:06:07,550
the whole village,

895
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,532
There was-- there was some

896
01:06:12,632 --> 01:06:14,332
terrorists, I don't know,

897
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:18,470
We couldn't leave any witnesses,

898
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:20,639
So I came inside of some house,

899
01:06:20,739 --> 01:06:24,441
and there was a girl,
she was 14, 1 5, 1 6,

900
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:25,644
I don't know,

901
01:06:25,744 --> 01:06:28,066
She spoke Russian, she knew

902
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,698
she was gonna die,

903
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:32,455
And she said,
"l don't want to

904
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,077
die as a virgin,"

905
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:41,827
So she didn't die as a virgin,

906
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:45,088
And after that,
it's all the same,

907
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:47,549
There's nothing left of me here,

908
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:50,301
There's nothing left,

909
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,086
Where's my present?

910
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:18,682
What's that?

911
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,601
That's it?

912
01:08:21,726 --> 01:08:22,811
No,

913
01:08:32,904 --> 01:08:34,197
Just let me go back,

914
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:37,667
Just got off the

915
01:08:37,767 --> 01:08:39,369
phone with the Major,

916
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,194
You're on the next

917
01:08:41,294 --> 01:08:42,854
transport out of Kabul,

918
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,626
Just let me go back,

919
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:55,627
Just let me go back,

920
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:14,988
Send me back,

921
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:39,512
Send me back,

922
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:35,925
I actually

923
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,123
never like to kill with a gun,

924
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:40,717
I prefer a knife,

925
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:57,389
Is it wrong to

926
01:11:57,489 --> 01:11:58,629
pray for revenge?

927
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:03,940
Look around you,

928
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,327
Is this what you want?

929
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:10,116
Hold on, Jose,
Y o, Rambo!

930
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:12,988
You lost or something?

931
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:16,408
Yeah, man, Get out
of here, Go sell your

932
01:14:16,508 --> 01:14:17,440

01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,284
Yo, make sure you shake it before you

934
01:14:19,384 --> 01:14:20,110

935
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,925
Like I was tellin' ya, I don't wanna

936
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:22,612

937
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:25,090
and have to smack your
bitches up, you hear me?

938
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:01,827
You know what, Antwan?

939
01:15:01,927 --> 01:15:03,286
What?

940
01:15:03,386 --> 01:15:05,098
Be careful with my baby, I just

941
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:06,114
had her detailed,

942
01:15:06,214 --> 01:15:07,666
Alright?

943
01:15:07,766 --> 01:15:09,592
Yeah,

944
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,139
You know what?

945
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:18,284
I don't want you eating

946
01:15:18,384 --> 01:15:19,794
inside the car, Huh?

947
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:21,715
That wasn't me

948
01:15:21,815 --> 01:15:22,856
there eating--

949
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:25,025
No scratches to the paint,

950
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,810
I heard,
Yes, Yes,

951
01:15:55,138 --> 01:15:57,549
If you're gonna park,

952
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:00,021
try not to do dings to my rims,

953
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:00,844
Alright?

954
01:16:00,944 --> 01:16:04,056
No dings to my rims,

955
01:16:04,156 --> 01:16:07,684
Yes, Master,

956
01:16:07,784 --> 01:16:09,444
Yeah, Anything else?

957
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:10,880
What happened to your car?

958
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:11,805
You never told me,

959
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,221
That wasn't me, man, It was

960
01:16:13,321 --> 01:16:14,182
some Jersey driver

961
01:16:14,282 --> 01:16:15,645
that got in the fucking way,

962
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:16,351
but I'm cool,

963
01:16:18,411 --> 01:16:19,913
Come on,

964
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,129
Ah!

965
01:16:33,343 --> 01:16:35,804
Gracias, It's a lot of cabbage,

966
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:39,808
What do you say?
Lunch is on me,

967
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,760
It's good,

968
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:44,026
It's good, Hey,
uh, Juju, you know,

969
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:45,380
I sing a little bit,

970
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:46,757
Uh, we should get together

971
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:47,674
and jam sometime,

972
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:48,996
This is nice,
we could cut

973
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:49,759
a little demo,

974
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:51,319
Who knows?
I'm just saying--

975
01:16:51,444 --> 01:16:52,896
You'll cut a Christmas album,

976
01:16:52,996 --> 01:16:54,322
We're having lunch,
