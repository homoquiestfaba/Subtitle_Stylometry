<i>Lowest temperatures tomorrow night</i>
<i>will be somewhat higher than tonight</i>

5
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,309

00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:00,417
<i>Clear and calm, firing for lemons will be</i>
<i>necessary beginning about 2:00 a.m.</i>

9

00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,168
<i>Well, the night before I met her,</i>
<i>I was in my hotel room on Bunker Hill</i>

15
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,933
<i>down in the very middle of Los Angeles.</i>

16
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,601
<i>It was called the Alta Loma.</i>

17
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,809
<i>It was built on a hillside in reverse</i>

18
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,439
<i>so that the main floor</i>
<i>was on a level with the street.</i>

19
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,118
<i>My room was down on the fifth floor</i>

20
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,517
<i>so that my window was on a level</i>
<i>with the green hillside,</i>

21
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,886
<i>and there was no need for a key.</i>

22
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,584
<i>The window was always open.</i>

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,225
<i>I'd been going over the plans I'd made,</i>
<i>since I'd come here like everyone else</i>

24
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,596
<i>in search of fortune, fame, good health</i>
<i>and glamorous women.</i>

25
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,538
<i>Only I was going to be different.</i>

26
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,004
<i>Only I was going to be different.</i>

27
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,368
<i>I wasn't here to search for my future.</i>
<i>I was here to create it.</i>

28
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,568
<i>I'd write the first great novel</i>
<i>about this place</i>

29
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,669
<i>and everybody who came here</i>
<i>from somewhere else.</i>

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,681
The Road to Los Angeles
<i>by Arturo Bandini.</i>

31
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,017
<i>It would bring me everything</i>
<i>I ever wanted.</i>

32
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:12,188
<i>Now, after five months, I was trying</i>
<i>to make a very important decision.</i>

33
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,089
<i>What to do with my last nickel.</i>

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,461
<i>"Mr. Bandini, it has now been six weeks</i>
<i>since you've paid the rent.</i>

35
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,302
<i>"Four dollars per is mounting</i>
<i>like the national debt.</i>

36
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:33,268
<i>"Either you pay $24, every penny,</i>
<i>or pack up and leave."</i>

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,748
<i>It was her sixth note in six weeks.</i>

38
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,573
<i>Pretty humiliating.</i>

39
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,052
<i>My landlady was getting</i>
<i>more writing done than I was.</i>

40
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,588
<i>She was the kind of woman</i>
<i>who increased her height</i>

41
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,888
<i>by rising on tiptoe</i>
<i>and peering at me over her glasses.</i>

42
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,224
-I'd like a room.
-Do you have a job?

43
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,763
I'm a writer.

44
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,097
I'll be with you in a moment, Mr. Archer.

45
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,240
Wrote that.

46
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,077
Here. What's your name?

47
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,109
Mrs. Hargraves, why?

48
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,848
"For Mrs. Hargraves.

49
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,076
"A woman of ineffable charm,

50
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,987
"with lovely blue eyes

51
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,255
"From the author, Arturo Bandini."

52
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,557
"The Little Dog Laughed."

53
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,532
I hate dog stories.

54
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,065
Bandini. Young man,
are you a Mexican?

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,767
Me, a Mexican?

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,873
I'm an American, Mrs. Hargraves.
And that isn't a dog story, either.

57
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,506
We don't allow Mexicans in this hotel.

58
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,780
I'm not a Mexican,
and there isn't a dog in the whole story.

59
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,514
We don't allow Jews, either.

60
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,283
I got that title after the fable, you know,

61
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,417
"And the little dog laughed
To see such sport"

62
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02,467
So you're an author. How nice.

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,900
Here we are, Mr. Bandini.
This is one of my very favorite rooms.

64
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,771
There are windows on two sides,
which makes it extremely airy.

65
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,572
It's $4 a week,
and I expect to be paid in advance.

66
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,978
Now that includes cleaning
but no laundry. We never do...

67
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,071
<i>Through that window,</i>

68
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,913
<i>I saw my first palm tree</i>
<i>not six feet away,</i>

69
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,086
<i>but the palm was blackish</i>
<i>at its branches.</i>

70
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,850
-And no girls in the room.
-I'll take it.

71
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,135
<i>Stained by carbon monoxide</i>
<i>coming out of the Third Street Tunnel,</i>

<i>with dust and sand</i>

73
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,271
<i>that blew in from the Mojave</i>
<i>and Santa Ana deserts.</i>

74
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,674
<i>What jerk's gonna believe</i>
<i>I made it all the way</i>

75
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:57,119
<i>from Colorado to downtown L.A.</i>
<i>without seeing one goddamn palm tree?</i>

76
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,382
Kid?

77
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,749
Kid?

78
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,496
Kid.

79
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,124
Do you like milk?

80
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,927
Yes, Hellfrick. I like milk.

81
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,761
Okay, then.

82
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,199
Here's the plan.

83
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,710
The Adohr man's a friend of mine.

84
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,883
Every morning at 4:00,
he parks his truck behind the hotel

85
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,352
and comes up to my room for a while.

86
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,055
-That's not much of a plan, Hellfrick.
-No, kid, no.

87
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,055
While he's having one with me,

88
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,556
you get 10 minutes
to help yourself to the milk.

89
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,928
So what do you think?

90
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,559
If he's your friend,
why not just ask him for it?

91
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,298
Kid, come on. Who's kidding who?

92
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,541
He knows I don't drink milk.
I'm doing this for you.

93
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,579
No, thanks, Hellfrick.
I like to consider myself an honest man.

94
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:00,379
It certainly makes me wonder
about your ideas of friendship.

95
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,645
Okay.

96
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,257
Only trying to do you a favor.

97
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,759
You wanna do me a favor?
Pay me the money I loaned you.

98
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,227
-How much was that?
-Fifteen cents.

99
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,066
-Don't have it.
-Well, how about 10 cents? A nickel?

100
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,130
Can't give you any hard cash, kid,

101
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,043
but I'll see you get all the milk you need.

102
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,354
<i>Mencken. Editor of the greatest</i>

<i>is not serious.</i>

112
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,754
Think of something
besides stealing a bottle of milk.

113
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,589
You're an author, not a thief.

114
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,149
<i>The streets are full of them,</i>

<i>I'm an inexperienced jerk,</i>

00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,073

122
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,742
Very.

123
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,015

124
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,380
You're Italian.

125
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,721
That'll be two cents a day

<i>St. Teresa, when I was little,</i>
<i>I prayed to you for a fountain pen.</i>

Anyway, I got a fountain pen.

128
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:38,132
Now please, sweet and lovely Saint,

129
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,237
inspire me. Give me an idea,
so I can write a story,

130
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,815
a great story,

131
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,745
so I can be rich and famous
and not be ashamed of my name.

132
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,046
Door is open.

133
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,742
To you, Mencken. To the future.

134
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:26,147
<i>I headed down Third Street looking</i>

<i>And there it was.</i>

136
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,494
Come on.
Learn to dance if you can't walk!

137
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,548
<i>The perfect place to end up flat broke.</i>

138
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,156
-Can I get you something?
-Coffee with cream.

139
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,922
<i>Just five months ago,</i>
<i>I had $150 in my pocket</i>

140
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,025
<i>and big plans in my head.</i>

141
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:21,230
<i>In those days, I was Arturo Bandini,</i>
<i>lover of man and beast alike.</i>

142
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,410
<i>All I needed was to meet one</i>
<i>of those beautiful golden-haired girls</i>

143
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,449
<i>that seemed to grow like oranges</i>
<i>out here,</i>

144
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,884
<i>and I'd write a story, a love story,</i>
<i>one of the greatest of all time.</i>

145
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,772
Who brought this here?

146
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,777
There you go, Tony.

147
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,722
Thank you.

148
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,604
Are you done with that coffee?

149
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,270
You call this stuff coffee?
Maybe it isn't coffee at all.

150
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,447
Maybe it's just water after they boiled
your filthy shoes in it.

151
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,920
Maybe you don't know any better.
Maybe you're just naturally careless.

152
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,223
But if I were you,
I wouldn't be seen in a Main Street alley

153
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,588
wearing those <i>haraches.</i>

154
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,788
It's <i>huaraches,</i> not <i>haraches.</i>

155
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,894
I hope you die of heart failure right there
on that chair.

156
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,269
Camilla.

157
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,310
It's not my fault. I didn't do nothing.

158
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,610
I swear to God, I just asked him
if he wanted some coffee!

159
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,309
Take care of it.

160
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,489
If he's sick, get him out of here.

161
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,558
Hey.

162
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,227
Young fellow, are you all right?

163
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,792
You there? Oh, say something, please.

164
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,501
You can dish it out, but you can't take it,
can you?

165
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,371
You want the nickel?

166
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,235
Then mop it up.

167
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,394
Hey, you!

168
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,043
<i>Sand from the Mojave</i>
<i>was blowing across the city.</i>

169
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,711
<i>It was everywhere.</i>

170
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,452
<i>It was even between the sheets,</i>
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

171
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,962
<i>All I could think about</i>
<i>were those</i> huaraches.

172
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,298
<i>"To a Mayan princess</i>
<i>from a worthless gringo."</i>

173
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,878
What's the name of the girl
who works here?

174
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,042
You mean Camilla?

175
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,950
The one who was here yesterday.
The Mexican.

176
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,579
Camilla Lopez.

177
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,649
Will you give this to her?

178
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,092
Take good care of it. It's valuable.
See that Miss Lopez gets it personally.

179
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,837
<i>The truth was, I couldn't afford</i>
<i>to go back and see her that night.</i>

180
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,779
<i>I didn't have a nickel for a cup of coffee.</i>

181
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,487
What do you want?

182
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,863
I'm an honest man, kid.

183
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,462
There, see if he wants a beer
on the house.

184
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,410
Sorry about the coffee.

185
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,574
Everybody orders beer around here.
We don't get that many calls for coffee.

186
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,211
I can see why.
I'd drink beer, too, if I could afford it.

187
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,687
Anyway, I hope this is better.
You want cream, right?

188
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,632
Not bad. Certainly an improvement
over last night.

189
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,866
Did you read "The Little Dog Laughed"?

190
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,542
"The Little Dog Laughed,"
by me, Arturo Bandini.

191
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,745
Arturo?

192
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,621
Bandini. It's Italian.
Did you read the story?

193
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,255
-Sure.
-So?

194
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,366
It's very good.

195
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,758
Hey, listen. You want a beer?

196
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,394
I can get you some.
You don't have to pay.

197
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,336
What did you like about it?

198
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,772
-Camilla.
-I have to go.

199
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,022
You still haven't told me
what you thought.

200
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,184
I told you. I liked it. I like dog stories.

201
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,631
-You like dog stories.
-I like dogs a lot...

202
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,963
-There's no dog in the story.
-There's no dog...

203
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,626
There's no dog in the story!

204
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,398
Okay. I heard you.

205
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,665
Then why did you call it
"The Little Dog Laughter"?

206
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,437
Why did you lie to me? Why did you
just say you read it when you didn't?

207
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,810
Listen, kid. Please, drink your beer.

208
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,609
It's tough enough just to have
a good time, okay?

209
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,572
Sir! Sir!

210
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,778
Forgot your hat.

211
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,553
-Something else you wanted to say?
-Camilla can't read.

212
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,618
Not English, anyway.

213
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,102
<i>And another thing, Mr. Mencken,</i>
<i>I have no understanding of women.</i>

214
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,832
<i>How can I write about</i>
<i>what I don't understand?</i>

215
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,841
<i>How can I write about experiences</i>
<i>I haven't had?</i>

216
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,704
<i>When I first came here,</i>
<i>I was so sure of myself.</i>

217
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,713
<i>So sure I wasn't like the others.</i>

218
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,682
<i>The others came to the land of sunshine</i>
<i>with just enough money to live</i>

219
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,776
<i>until the sun killed them.</i>

220
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,947
<i>Take Hellfrick, across the hall,</i>
<i>from Minnesota.</i>

221
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,091
<i>Gassed in the Great War</i>
<i>and gassed ever since.</i>

222
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,128
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>he has no idea where he is.</i>

223
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,924
<i>So, I guess here is as good</i>
<i>as anywhere else.</i>

224
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,091
<i>Heilman's a bank teller</i>
<i>from South Bend.</i>

225
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:20,103
<i>But his health is bad and he was told</i>
<i>he had to stay here or die.</i>

226
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,140
<i>He hates the sun and the fog</i>
<i>and the SC Trojans.</i>

227
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,141
<i>My landlady's from Back East.</i>

228
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,679
<i>She tries to make the hotel lobby</i>
<i>look like Bridgeport, Connecticut.</i>

229
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,975
<i>No Mexicans and lots of doilies.</i>

230
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,074
-Will there be anything else, ma'am?
-No, thank you.

231
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,278
<i>Then there's the Filipino houseboy</i>
<i>from Hawaii</i>

232
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,752
<i>and the redhead from St. Louis.</i>

233
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,379
-Hello.
-Hello.

234
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,152
-How are you?
-Better now.

235
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,921
<i>She's come to feel he's terribly brave</i>
<i>in the face of so much prejudice.</i>

236
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,827
<i>The other day when I was going</i>
<i>to San Pedro,</i>

237
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,196
<i>looking for work at the canneries,</i>
<i>I saw them.</i>

238
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,169
<i>Even with high leather heels,</i>
<i>he was a foot shorter than she was.</i>

239
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,104
<i>I don't know where the girl</i>
<i>in the red fox fur is from,</i>

240
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,770
<i>but you can find her in Bernstein's Fish</i>
<i>Grotto with a fresh one every week.</i>

241
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,913
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>there's the Japanese man</i>

242
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,246
<i>who grows his vegetables</i>
<i>down on Jefferson, near the sloughs.</i>

243
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:11,254
<i>Bullet-faced and always smiling,</i>
<i>he keeps me alive for a nickel.</i>

244
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,223
You like plums? Good. Good for you.

245
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,194
<i>Of course there are others too poor</i>
<i>and too unlucky</i>

246
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,128
<i>to be allowed to call</i>
<i>any place their own.</i>

247
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,694
<i>Even for a while.</i>

248
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,429
All right, <i>amigos.</i>

249
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,207
<i>In the end, we're all strangers here.</i>

250
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,302
<i>Maybe the only thing that makes you</i>
<i>a Californian is a pair of sunglasses</i>

251
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,440
<i>and a four-bit polo shirt.</i>
<i>Suddenly, you belong.</i>

252
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,612
Mr. Bandini. You have mail.

253
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,950
<i>"Dear Mr. Bandini,</i>
<i>with your permission,</i>

254
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,156
<i>"I shall remove the salutation</i>
<i>and ending of your very long letter</i>

255
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,334

256

263
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,761
<i>"This owing to the incontestable fact</i>

271
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,471
Still mad at me?

272
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,040
Not that I know of.

273
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,010
Well, would you like
to order something?

274
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,009
A cigar. Something from Havana.

275
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,975
They're a quarter.

276
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,148
Keep the change.

277
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,136
-I said keep the change.
-Not from you.

278
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,142
You're poor.

279
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,854
Don't I look different?

280
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,222
I thought you'd like my shoes.

281
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,658
They're very nice.

282
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,025
How about something to drink?
Scotch highball.

283
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,568
Saint James.

284
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,935
Sammy, get me a highball.
Saint James.

285
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,575
You've changed.

286
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,588
Before you were just mean.

287
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,626
Now that you've got a couple of bucks,
you're mean and stuck-up.

288
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,960
Forty cents.

289
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,753
Well, you haven't changed.

290
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,957
You're just the same little
Mexican princess,

291
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,592
-charming and innocent.
-I'm not charming and I'm not innocent.

292
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,934
To me you'll always be a sweet
little peon, a flower girl from old Mexico.

293
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,098
You dago son of a bitch!

294
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,707
I'm just as American as you are.

295
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,344
Or at least I will be
as soon as I pass my test.

296
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,449
Sure you will,
just as soon as you learn how to read.

297
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,259
Take off those shoes.

298
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,928
My legs are not good enough for them?

299
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,932
They're not good enough for your legs.

300
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,310
Sorry what I called you.
I didn't mean what I said.

301
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,274
I didn't either.

302
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,616
-You got a car?
-No.

303
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,153
I do. It's in the parking lot.

304
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,990
It's a '27 convertible.

305
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,991
The stuffing, it's a little bit
out of the upholstery, but it runs.

306
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,827
I'm off at 11:00.

307
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,067
Camilla Lombard?

308
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,081
Arturo.

309
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,186
-This is Sammy.
-Hi.

310
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,952
Are you coming?

311
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,870
Have a good night.

312
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,718
Be right back.

313
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,755
Who is he?

314
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,926
Sammy? Just a friend.

315
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,361
What kind of a friend?

316
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,633
A good one.

317
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,328
He got me my job.

318
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,565
-They let the bartender hire you?
-Sammy's not just the bartender.

319
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,578
Oh, yeah?
What else is he, a concert pianist?

320
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,675
Listen, Arturo,
you're not the only writer in town.

321
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,357
-Sammy's a writer?
-You'd be surprised.

322
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,122
I'd be surprised
if he could write his name.

323
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,527
Do you like my car?

324
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,031
How come it's registered to
Camilla Lombard? Your name's Lopez.

325
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,726
-You married?
-No.

326
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,427
-So what's the Lombard for?
-For fun.

327
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,837
-Sometimes I use it professionally.
-As a waitress?

328
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,403
Do you like your name?

329
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:51,175
Don't you wish it was Johnson
or Williams or something?

330
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,908
-No.
-Come on.

331
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,782
Do you honestly like
being called Bandini?

332
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,283
-I'm satisfied with my name.
-No, you're not.

333
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,858
-I am.
-You're not.

334
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,984
-I am.
-You're not.

335
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,721
-I am.
-You're not.

336
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,355
What's Sammy's last name,
Johnson or Williams?

337
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,627
White.

338
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,795
Pretty much sums up your ambition
in life, doesn't it? To be Mrs. White?

339
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,965
You can be a real son of a bitch,
you know that?

340
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,938
-Are you still cold?
-No.

341
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,641
The cliffs keep you warm.

342
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,542
They're like a blanket
when you're underneath them.

343
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,282
Why do you get so mean?

344
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,851
Why do you get so mean?

345
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,361
Can't we be friends?

346
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,400
Friends like you and Sammy?

347
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,610
Look at the fog.

348
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,325
An army of ghosts crawling
on their bellies.

349
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,921
What are you talking about?

350
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,857
The fog bank.
It creeps in and hugs the water.

351
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,033
-You didn't answer my question.
-I know what a fog bank is.

352
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,507
And what about you and Sammy?

353
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,204
Who are you interested in,
me or Sammy?

354
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,144
Come on, why don't you teach me
how to ride a wave?

355
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,477
Out there, in all this fog?

356
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,353
Yeah, why not?

357
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,313
Are you afraid?

358
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,193
Of course not.

359
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,502
What are you waiting for?

360
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,035
Come in! Come here!

361
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,946
Come here! Come on!

362
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,884
Get in here!

363
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,456
What are you hiding?

364
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,864
You got a pretty one.
Pink as a baby's bottom.

365
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,126
Relax. Let's have some fun.

366
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:07,573
-You're not gonna ride a wave tonight.
-Sure I will. You show me how.

367
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,770
I'm from Colorado.

368
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,609
You mean you don't know
how to ride a wave?

369
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,980
Listen. My technique might be not good
for you to learn. It's unorthodox.

370
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,178
That's okay. I'd like to learn from you.

371
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,120
The first thing you gotta do is
get to where the waves are.

372
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,350
Don't take any chances.
Just stay back, stay right there.

373
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,120
I will, I promise.

374
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,064
Just watch me...

375
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,017
-Help!
-Camilla!

376
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,088
Camilla?

377
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,150
Camilla! Camilla!

378
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,431
Oh, God. Camilla!

379
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,706
Camilla!

380
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,113
Where'd she go? Where'd she go?

381
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,781
Camilla! Camilla!

382
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,723
Camilla!

383
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,932
Fooled you pretty good!

384
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,278
It was as good as your heart attack.

385
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,908
-Admit it.
-It was better.

386
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,711
You can dish it out,
but you can't take it, huh?

387
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,860
Cut it out!

388
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,695
It was a joke, God damn it!
What are you trying to do, drown me?

389
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,006
I'll never forgive you.
Not for my whole life.

390
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,274
I thought your life was over.

391
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,683
I thought I was gonna die
looking for you.

392
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,787
That was my first time in the ocean.

393
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,832
What you gonna do now, walk home?

394
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,062
It's 10 miles to downtown.
Where do you live?

395
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,771
The Alta Loma.

396
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,242
Bunker Hill.

397
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,512
Old women and weak men.
Perfect place for you.

398
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:05,248
Couldn't be better.
In my hotel they don't allow Mexicans.

399
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,369
White dough.

400
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,007
No wonder she laughed. Who wouldn't?

401
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,376
Arturo Bandini, genius,
man of the world,

402
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,348
can't take a walk on the beach
without trying to hide his dick.

403
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,626
<i>I never wanted to see you again.</i>
<i>You were so mean last night.</i>

404
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,187
<i>Get in.</i>

405
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,992
<i>What for?</i>

406
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,126
<i>Get in.</i>

407
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,179
<i>Arturo, don't stop.</i>

408
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,448
<i>Please don't ever stop. Arturo...</i>

409
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,026
Jesus Christ, Hellfrick!

410
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,762
Have you ever heard of knocking
before you come into a room?

411
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:23,459
Sorry, kid. Didn't mean to disturb you.

412
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,064
Artist at work, huh?

413
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,203
Listen, kid.

414
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,606
How much dough you got?

415
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,338
-Oh, for Christ's sake!
-No, no, no, it's not for booze.

416
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,011
-Well, then what's it for?
-Meat.

417
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,908
Meat?

418
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:45,278
I mean like the steaks you used to get
Back East.

419
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,182
Real meat. Not like out here.

420
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:52,421
Sure. Cattle are different out here.

421
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,893
Absolutely.

422
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,999
Here's always sunny and dry.
Cows eat nothing but weeds.

423
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,562
Dead weeds. Meat's full of worms.

424
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,801
They paint it to look bloody and red.
Did you know that?

425
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,473
Maybe you could use that
in one of your...

426
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,480
Okay, okay. What do you need?

427
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,346
Fifty cents? There's a butcher on Olive.

428
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,712
He's got the real McCoy,
beef from Kansas City.

429
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,986
It would help keep me off the hard stuff.

430
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,630
I'll make it good with you, kid.

431
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,807
I'll pay you back 1,000 times.

432
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,939
<i>I had just under $10.</i>

433
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,408
<i>It would pay the rent</i>
<i>for two-and-a-half weeks</i>

434
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,852
<i>or buy me three pairs of shoes</i>
<i>or two pairs of pants</i>

435
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,583
<i>or 1,000 postage stamps</i>
<i>to send stories to Mencken.</i>

436
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,359
<i>But you don't have any stories or talent.</i>

437
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:08,366
"Don't stop. Don't stop.
Please don't ever stop."

438
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,335
Garbage.

439
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,435
Camilla. Camilla, wait up.

440
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,101
-Did you ask him?
-What's in it for him?

441
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,351
Just do it.

442
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,557
Who is it?

443
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,407
-Hello.
-What are you doing?

444
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,813
Do I know you?

445
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,215
Who are you?

446
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,978
"He took her roughly in his arms.

447
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,252
"She pressed herself
against his throbbing loins.

448
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,127
"'Don't stop! Don't ever stop."'

449
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,026
-Hey, that's private.
-I hope so.

450
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,394
It should never be made public.

451
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,065
It's pitiful and sad.

452
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,771
A hopelessly bad writer
buried in a cheap hotel on Bunker Hill.

453
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,439
In Los Angeles, of all places.

454
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,353
-They'll never read what you write.
-That's not really my writing.

455
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,318
They won't even have a chance
to forget it.

456
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,391
Say, what's going on?
Where did you come from?

457
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,224
-Is this a gag?
-You're nobody.

458
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,222
I might have been somebody,

459
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,630
and here we are.

460
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,476
Lady. Lady, you've got to sober up.

461
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,212
How about a little fresh air?

462
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,649
We could go out
and have a drink. Money.

463
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:46,687
Lady?

464
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,529
Good idea. Let's have a drink.

465
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,267
You are gonna be so marvelous!
So wonderful!

466
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,807
-My landlady.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

467
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,572
-Forget it, now. Let's just walk.
-Okay, but we're having a drink.

468
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,741
I insist. Look, money!

469
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,342
Okay, we'll have a drink.
Just put it back in your purse.

470
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,099
-Hey, Mr. Bandini.
-Hi, Solomon. How's business?

471
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:31,800
Till you showed up, Mr. Bandini, I had
more pinball machines than customers.

472
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,437
-A short beer, am I right?
-And whiskey.

473
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,505
Lots of whiskey.

474
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,077
Does he know you?

475
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,812
Your mouth, your wonderful mouth.
God, what a mouth.

476
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,891
No, let's have a drink first.

477
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,428
-What's wrong?
-You know what's wrong.

478
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:02,062
-No, I don't.
-You're just like the rest of them.

479
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,863
-You know!
-Know what?

480
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:08,035
-That's why you won't kiss me!
-Here we go. One short beer.

481
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,675
And double whiskey.

482
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,082
-So who was it?
-Who was what?

483
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,346
Who told you about my wounds?

484
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,086
Your wounds?

485
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:25,053
Do you have a nickel?
I love pinball machines.

486
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,130
One game. Would you mind?

487
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,896
-Whatever my darling wishes.
-Thank you.

488
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:49,575
Solomon, could you come over here?
For some reason, it's on tilt.

489
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,352
Play. Play.

490
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,850
Who is that woman?

491
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,188
Who knows?

492
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,425
She was in a week before last,

493
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,692
when you were talking
about Sinclair Lewis

494
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,961
to that couple from Minnesota.

495
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:08,800
-I didn't notice her.
-Well, she noticed you, believe you me.

496
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,939
Listened to every word you said.
Every single word.

497
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,303
-And when you left, she left.
-And what's she doing now?

498
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,919
-Watching you like a prize dog.
-I gotta get out of here.

499
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,517
Door opposite the men's room.

500
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,124
Is everything all right, darling?
Do you need another nickel?

501
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,896
No. No, I'm just gonna use...

502
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,032
-Oh, my God!
-Darling.

503
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,061
I took a cab and the door was open.

504
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,762
Don't you think this has gone
far enough?

505
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,102
"I see them in the lobbies of hotels.

506
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,337
"I see them sunning in the parks
and limping out of little ugly churches,

507
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,108
"dispossessed in this place
where the seasons never change."

508
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,012
That's more like it.

509
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,421
Will you please get out?

510
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,050
You're my darling,
and you're going to love me.

511
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,287
Some other time. I think you better go.
I mean it.

512
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,569
I know how I revolt you,

513
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,132
that you know what my clothes
are covering up.

514
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,868
Know what?
I don't even know your name.

515
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,611
Vera Rivkin.

516
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,380
Back East I had a real life

517
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,973
and friends who knew about
H.L. Mencken

518
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,211
and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

519
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,219
Now I'm a housekeeper.

520
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,718
I work for a nice Jewish family
in Long Beach.

521
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,796
I'm tired. Tired of housekeeping.

522
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,899
Then one day, I saw you at Solomon's,

523
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,099
and I heard you talk.

524
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,073
And I went and I bought your story.

525
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,333
And I read it.

526
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,415
And I felt that you were someone

527
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,711
who could look at me
and see me for what I am.

528
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,287
So I followed you home.

529
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,254
So stupid.

530
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,754
Hopeless.

531
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,954
But I'm really a good person.
Honestly, I am.

532
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,095
Here.

533
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,164
Thank you.

534
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,838
-What do you want me to do?
-Tell me I'm like other women.

535
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,346
-Tell me I'm beautiful, please.
-But you are beautiful.

536
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,883
Really, you are.

537
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,381
This is just a childish obsession.

538
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:14,446
You know, maybe a hangover
from the mumps. I don't know.

539
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,583
Plenty of men would give anything...

540
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,620
Let me show you something.

541
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,260
-You don't have to show me anything.
-You're going to see it for yourself.

542
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,533
Undo this, please.

543
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,272
Look, you've convinced me, all right?

544
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,476
Yeah. Yeah, I thought so.

545
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,219
You know all about them.

546
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,823
So what's the fuss? That's nothing.

547
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,332
Tell that to my husband.

548
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,497
"Deformed, disfigured,

549
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,273
"disgusting."

550
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,939
That's what he said.

551
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,350
I say,

552
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,052
you're beautiful.

553
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,475
Excuse me.

554
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,241
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,712
I'm so sorry. I don't know
what was in my head. I just...

556
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,950
Take it easy.
I'll wait outside so you can...

557
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,827
Take it easy.

558
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,317
<i>"Dear Boy,</i>

559
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,725
<i>"of course I should have known</i>
<i>you'd have a girlfriend.</i>

560
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,824
<i>"Is she very beautiful?</i>

561
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,989
<i>"She's very lucky.</i>

562
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,595
<i>"Is she also kind and generous?</i>

563
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,900
<i>"Would she ever allow you to come</i>

564
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,940
<i>I woke up relieved to think</i>

565
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,106
<i>there were other possibilities in life</i>
<i>besides Camilla.</i>

566
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,083
<i>Maybe Vera was a little crazy,</i>
<i>but like she said about herself,</i>

567
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,619
<i>she was a good person.</i>

568
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,814
<i>We'd read the same books,</i>

569
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,950
<i>and she was capable</i>

570
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,292
<i>Suddenly, I felt better about myself.</i>
<i>I was once again, Arturo Bandini,</i>

571
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,663
<i>lover of man and beast alike,</i>
<i>and afraid of nothing.</i>

572
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:48,528
Mr. Bandini! Hey! Bandini!

573
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,941
It's Sammy,
the bartender at the Columbia.

574
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,442
-Yeah. Sammy White.
-Yeah.

575
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,608
-Camilla says you've been published.
-What of it?

576
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,876
I was thinking about getting into
that line of work.

577
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,182
-Publishing?
-No, writing stories like you.

578
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:09,958
Bartending and the damp nights don't
seem to agree with me much anymore.

579
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,624
Looking to find something I can do
pretty much anywhere.

580
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,425
Like writing stories.

581
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,727
Yeah, well, good luck to you, Sammy.

582
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,234
Yeah, I was hoping
you could give me a few pointers.

583
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,397
And that magazine
with "The Little Dog Laughing" in it,

584
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,169
you wouldn't happen to have
a spare copy?

585
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,375
I'd sure like to read your story.

586
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,677
I know I got one in here somewhere.

587
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,582
Thank you, Arturo. It's a real honor.

588
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:48,027
Like I said, I was hoping you could
give me some pointers about writing.

589
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,195
If there's anything I can do for you,
you let me know.

590
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,668
Sounds like you've got something
in mind.

591
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:58,434
Well, thought you might like
a little advice about Camilla.

592
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:03,710
That's real white of you, Sammy,
but I think I can handle the situation.

593
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,411
Okey-dokey.

594
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,147
But you know what they say,
"Never a horse that couldn't be rode,

595
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,814
"never a cowboy
that couldn't be throwed."

596
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,883
And Camilla's one tough little pony.
She's got a real hard mouth on her.

597
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,929
"A real hard mouth."
Interesting turn of phrase.

598
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,095
You're too nice to that girl, Mr. Bandini.

599
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,829
-Too nice?
-Way too nice.

600
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,405
You don't understand Mexican women.

601
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,200
-Oh, Mexican women are different.
-No, sir.

602
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,906
They're like most women,
except more so.

603
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,815
You let up on them,
they're all gonna take advantage.

604
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,543
But you ease up on that little spic,

605
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,915
she gonna peg you
for a lily-livered gringo

606
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,183
and buck you out of the saddle
before you're in it.

607
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:52,728
A horse with a hard mouth
don't feel the bit, Arturo.

608
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,992
So, keep them on a tight rein,

609
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:01,129
never let them forget
who's boss for a second. No trick to it.

610
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,665
Ride them hard and it's easy.

611
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:08,644
Well, Sammy,
sounds like you know your horseflesh.

612
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,679
Yeah, I hope so, Arturo.

613
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,683
I'm gonna write Westerns.

614
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,282
By the way, <i>amigo,</i>

615
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,854
Camilla's one pony
who's worth the ride.

616
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,765
I'm glad to see you.

617
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,162
Why?

618
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:38,831
Okay.

619
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,208
Sammy told me
you were really nice to him.

620
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:48,373
I was beginning to think
you couldn't be nice to anyone.

621
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,755
-Can I get you something?
-Where is Sammy tonight?

622
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,587
-He left.
-Went home?

623
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,790
To the desert for a while.
He hasn't been feeling real good.

624
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,398
-What's the matter with him?
-Camilla.

625
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,565
TB, I think.

626
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,050
Here. You can start with this.

627
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:26,118
-Sammy has tuberculosis.
-Yeah. Tough break, huh?

628
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,281
We all gotta go.

629
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,424
What are you talking about?

630
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,234
-He won't live long.
-How dare you say something like that!

631
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,932
So how are all your other boyfriends?

632
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,507
I haven't got any other boyfriends!

633
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:48,076
Sure. Forgive an incautious remark.

634
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,244
Could I have the check?

635
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,647
No charge. It's on Sammy.

636
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,927
Bandini.

637
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,534
You don't have to pay
to be a smart aleck.

638
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:23,908
Besides, if it cost more than half a buck,
you couldn't afford to be one.

639
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,709
You're very funny.
Sammy writing your dialogue?

640
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:31,218
Why do you have to be so mean?

641
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,845
Mean? Me?

642
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,254
I'm anything but mean.

643
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,890
I'm a lover, my dear girl.
Equally fond of man and beast alike.

644
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,429
You can't be mean
and be a great writer.
