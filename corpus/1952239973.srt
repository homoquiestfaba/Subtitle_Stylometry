1
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,281
New Orleans in the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina.

2
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,293
Oh shit.

3
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,034
- Duffy split.
- Yeah.

4
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,028
Freaking Duffy. Duffy rolls out of
here...

5
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:18,033
...in a brand new Cadillac up the lot,
has the nerve to ask me to clean up his
fucking locker and save it for him.

6
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,169
Probably has dirty pictures of his wife.

7
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,105
I don't know what the fuck is in here.

8
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,250
He does have dirty pictures of his wife.

9
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,093
Yes, he does.

10
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,116
Lucky man, her hooters.

11
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,188
You like that, huh?

12
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,097
Alright,

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,997
Here's what I'm gonna do.

14
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,065
I'm gonna keep 'em.

15
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,138
Now, I gotta answer to Duffy for that.

16
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,239
I'll answer to him.

17
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,009
It means that Duffy's been marked a bad
guy.

18
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,171
Fuck Duffy! Just fuck him! Fuck all of
them!

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,114
Five copies of an arrest report.

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,212
The prisoner was transported. There
wouldn't still be 5 copies here.

21
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,190
Duffy might have left them downstairs.
What's his name? Chavez.

22
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,022
Let's go find him

23
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,130
Who's there?

24
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,138
That's strange 'coz the manifest says
the prisoners all evacuated.

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,008
- Anything is possible in this storm.
- Who's there?

26
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,010
I feel bad coming on. Should we open
the casino?

27
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,009
Please

28
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,238
Alright, up to his nose by 4 o'clock.

29
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,243
What took you so long, man?
Please.

30
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,143
Please what, Shit bird?

31
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,254
Get me the fuck out of here, man. The
water's rising.

32
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,222
It rises for like three hours, man.

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,023
I'm not gonna be able to fucking stand
here, man.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,128
I'm fucking drown, man. The water
doesn't stop, man.

35
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,062
It keeps rising and shit, man. Get me
the fuck out of here.

36
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,122
There's fucking snakes and shit in this
water, bro.

37
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,998
- Get me out.
- Alright, twenty bucks.

38
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,002
...and the polaroid.

39
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,061
Says nothing happened before 5.

40
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,233
Twenty bucks. What the fuck is that?
Let's make it worth our while, at least.

41
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,235
- A dime.
- I'm not betting any of those thousand dollars.

42
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,042
Get me the fuck out of here, man.

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,139
The water keeps rising, man. Get me
the fuck out of here!

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,151
Alright, 200 and the polaroids.

45
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,015
Please, motherfucker! Please!

46
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,247
Please what, Shit turd?

47
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,157
You gotta broke leg, Sir. Please get
me out of here.

48
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,995
Wait a minute. You want me to get wet
on account of you?

49
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,125
Hey, man. I got on Swiss cotton
underpants.

50
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,033
Yeah, that's right.
Cost me $ 55 a pair.

51
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,030
You think I wanna get all this brown
water and shit all over?

52
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,140
You got underwear that cost $ 55?

53
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,136
My girl gave it to me.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,139
[Chavez praying]

55
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,152
Come on, we get the time.

56
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,153
- What are you doing?
- Hold this.

57
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,225
Aw, come on, man.

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,058
Let the fire department get him out.
What are you crazy?

59
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,187
He ain't worth it.

60
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,133
Come on, man.

61
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,126
You are crazy.

62
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:00,298
You okay, man?

63
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,131
You okay?

64
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,238
Well the good news, Terrence is, I'll
okay you to return to full duty.

65
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,176
The bad news is in an all likelihood,
you'll be experiencing moderate to
severe back pain.

66
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,053
How severe?

67
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,051
You wanna be taking something for it.

68
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,126
I'm gonna write you a prescription for
Vicodin.

69
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:23,289
For how long?

70
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,129
From now on.

71
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,064
No. For how long am I gonna get pain?

72
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,230
We're gonna try to manage this as long
as we can.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,137
- You mean for the rest of my life?
- Probably.

74
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:38,075
But they're making advancements everyday, so...
just work with me on this, alright?

75
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,171
Now. When this runs out, call the
office.

76
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,088
Thank you for helping me honor our
fallen heroes today.

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,217
We will now move on to the awards and
promotions.

78
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,153
Among those being promoted to Lieutenant
today,

79
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,257
It gives me great pleasure,

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,259
to additionally award the "Distinguished
Service Cross"

81
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,201
...to Sergeant, now Lieutenant

82
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:13,008
In recognition of extreme valor in the
line of duty.

83
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,046
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

84
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,233
Six months later

85
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,251
There's 3 more.

86
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,266
You don't wanna look.
It's execution style.

87
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,018
What did you come up with?

88
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,022
Scale in the closet, bundle of glass in
envelopes.

89
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,058
I thought he went away?

90
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,118
He's out. Saw him the other day.

91
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,229
Let's get him in.

92
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,164
His baby mama is over by General Taylor
annunciation

93
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,263
- You have forms during the canvas?
- Duty camp sent 'em out.

94
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,005
Whoever they talk to, I want follow up
by a member of the squad.

95
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,198
You see that personally, Armand.

96
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,267
- They brought security cameras?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,204
- Every license plate in the area?
- Got it.

98
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:55,005
"My friend" by Babacar Ndele.

99
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,076
My friend is a fish

100
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,179
He live in my room

101
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,015
His fin is a cloud

102
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,150
Hee see me when I sleep.

103
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,181
Couple's name: Dauta and Yasin Ndele.

From what we know, Dauta had been dealing
heroin to supplement his income as a peddler.

108
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,072
Now I want every drug dealer, every
junkie within a 5 mile radius...

109
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,144
...hassled in giving up who his
supplier was.

110
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,239
Due to the nature of this crime, you got full
authorization per over time if you need it.

111
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,244
Lieutenant McDonagh gonna be heading up
the investigation, so coordinate with him.

112
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,984
That's it, let's see some results.

113
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,249
McDonagh! See you in my office for a minute.

114
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,194
- You up to this?
- Why wouldn't I be?

115
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,206
I know you still having problems to back,

116
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,038
Getting to be in pain a lot of the time.

117
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,202
I'm managing.

118
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,146
You still take medication for it?

119
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,108
Only what the doctor prescribes

120
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,046
We never let it be somebody with more time on
the job handles this kind of investigation.

121
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,283
But I'm gonna go out on a limb with you 'coz you
got good instinct and dont do nothin' but work.

122
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:02,066
But I find out that you needed help you
didn't ask for, I'm gonna be mad.

123
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,068
Yes Sir.

124
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,161
How's your man doing?

125
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:10,006
He's drinking himself into another glass.

126
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,044
- Give my best, would you?
- I will.

127
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:18,081
- Lieutenant, no more unnecessary jumps, huh?
- Yes Sir.

128
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,281
Hi, honey.

129
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,153
You bring me something?

00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,037
You need to call him back?

133
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,203
No.

134
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,265
You know I'd rather go
to the mountain with you.

135
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,169
I can't afford it

136
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,180
I can. I can afford it.

137
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,133
Yeah. Who brought him in?

138
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,095
That's who is questioning him?

139
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,003
I'll be there in 10 minutes, tell him
I'm on my way.

140
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,170
Tell him if he put his hands on this
guy, he's gonna have a problem.

141
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,081
I don't give a shit, Armand. You tell
him to take a fucking break.

142
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,110
Excuse me, could you tell me how much
longer that's gonna be?

143
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,089
Hello, Miss. I'm a lieutenant in the
police department.

144
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,217
I'm in the middle of a homicide
investigation.

145
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,023
Can I get my prescription, please?

146
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,189
Do you see I'm on the phone?

147
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,191
Hey, you can't come back here.

148
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,259
You got me waiting for 14 minutes, so you
can make a fucking personal phone call.

149
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,270
Security! Security in the pharmacy.
Security to pharmacy, please.

150
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,238
- This is it. This is it
- Come on.

151
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,007
Police emergency. This is it.

152
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,071
- You're no cop.
- What is that look like?

153
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,117
Then why are you acting all crazy for?

154
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:10,213
This is uh... $ 23 right, get
everybody a drink.

155
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,157
Get the fuck out of my way.

156
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,996
Look at me, okay?

157
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,126
2 hours. I said enough.

158
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,135
Now tell me something I don't know

159
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,104
- Man you better get me out of here.
- Get you out of here? What are you crazy?

160
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,007
I got you on possesion. You're on parole.

161
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,044
Man, one skinny ass joint, man.

162
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,012
You gotta help me,
or I'll gonna get you back...

163
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,140
I got 5 dead people, man.
You understand?

164
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,149
I don't know where the body

165
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,179
Don't bullshit. For the murder, man.
Tell me something.

166
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,020
What do you want me to tell you?

167
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,988
I want you to tell me something I
haven't heard.

168
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,219
I don't want you to tell me...
Look at me.

169
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,160
I don't want you to tell me, that you
don't know nothing.

170
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,218
But I don't know nothing.

171
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:52,190
Listen...

172
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,190
I got 2 dead baby Yambos.
You understand what that means?

173
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,226
That means I can do whatever I want in
this room.

174
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,165
That means Guantanamo Bay.
You believe this motherfucker?

175
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,076
I busted my ass for Yambos, and this
one won't tell me shit.

176
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,138
Detective. Can I see you outside for a
second?

177
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,011
Uh, Yeah... Sure.

178
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,014
Two minutes. Think about it.

179
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,181
Oh not a great time to take a break.

180
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,224
- What are you doing?
- What? He's about to go.

181
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,184
Bullshit, Stevie. He's scared out of
his mind, because you and your partner
may have spectacle out of picking him

182
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,197
Now everyone in Central City knows he's
in here.

183
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,994
- Are you trying to...
- No! Just shush.

184
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,991
Do you think he's gonna go out on a limb
you keep insulting him like that?

185
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,002
You are trying to tell me how to do my
interrogation?

186
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,163
Yes. As the matter of fact I'm gonna
tell you when I think you're doing is
something wrong.

187
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,037
Go and fuck yourself.

188
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,177
I'm gonna treat you respectfully.

189
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,239
You're treat me respectfully.

190
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:47,107
I'm looking at some bullshit pop bust and
because you're on parole, you wanted back
in Angola? Why would you do that?

191
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,087
Man, I ain't the one doing it.

192
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,247
Who just have Kingard pissed off?

193
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,254
I never said a two words to him.
I don't know.

194
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,286
But you knew he was selling dope tho.
Come on.

195
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,158
Should I just call your parole officer?
He'll violate you... Stop wasting my time.

196
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,066
- I knew he was sellin'
- Okay.

197
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,106
Tell me, where he was selling.
Whose neighborhood was it?

198
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,001
Man, look. I got me a good job at the
cleaning service.

199
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:17,080
I check in when I'm supposed to. I
smoke a little weed, but that's it.

200
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,142
Tell me, whose neighborhood it was,
Dob.

201
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,123
Man...

202
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,030
You know Fate?

203
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,057
Big Fate? Yeah.

204
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:40,170
Ain't nothin' moved that part of town.
He got a piece of it.

205
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,072
Where can I find him?

206
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,202
I've said all I must say.

207
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:50,113
Now if you want me to lead you to him,
you just roll like me the fuck back up.

208
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:04,253
Check Stevie's arrest report on Dob. Have it
mentioned marijuana, make sure it gets lost.

209
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,997
What do I tell Stevie?

210
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,125
You can tell him to go fuck himself.

211
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,293
I'm gonna go upstairs
and catch an hour in the crib.

212
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,152
What do you want, Mundt?

213
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,228
Internal Affair is just checking the
property room vouchers.

214
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,006
- So?
- So that means they're gonna find
out the shit missing.

215
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,100
Not if you don't tell them they won't.

216
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,268
I can't do it anymore, Terence.

217
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,243
Fuck!

218
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,219
Uhm... I'm really sorry. I just can't.

219
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:09,254
Mundt.

220
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,056
Whatever drugs might have been taken out
of the property or...

221
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,226
...have a voucher, you understand?

222
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:25,042
They won't turn up as missing, because
there's no record of them being there in
the first place. Okay?

223
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,137
They're installing cameras.

224
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,149
So then you don't do anything...

225
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,212
...where the cameras can see you.

226
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,281
I can't.

227
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:44,018
So when it was me redoing paperwork to
cover the cash you misplaced, that was
alright? That was entirely fucking...

228
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,131
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,001
Hei, Mundt!

230
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,239
You bad boy.

231
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,251
Stand against the wall

232
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,253
Come on!

233
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,989
- Stand against the wall!
- Okay.

234
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,199
You keep busy making out with your
girlfriend you don't know any done
something illegal?

235
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,063
- What are we hiding tonight?
- Nothing.

236
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,261
Does drug in that club?

237
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,001
No!

238
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,132
The two of you match the description.
Now empty your pocket and the handbag.

239
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,072
Why?

240
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,203
What, hard at hearing?
I said you match the description.

241
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,241
Somebody is in passing drugs.

242
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,083
I wasn't in passing drugs

243
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:12,981
What is that even mean?

244
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,078
Empty your pockets, stomp out the
handbag. I'm not gonna tell you again.

245
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,153
This is bullshit!

246
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,126
- Just do what he says, okay?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,129
- What do you got in there?
- Nothing.

248
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,254
I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?

249
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:27,223
No.

250
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,030
I get stuck, I'm gonna be very fucking angry.

251
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,260
You're not gonna get stuck.

252
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,173
Where's your badge if you're a cop?

253
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,042
This is what I'm looking for.

254
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,976
Here's where it says I'm a cop.

255
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,247
Sir, It's obviously just for personal use.

256
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,018
I'm not a dealer.

257
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,147
That's for the D.A. to decide.

258
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,020
You gonna dump that bag or I'm gonna do it?

259
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,056
Sir. Is there any way my parents dont
have to find out about this?

260
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,226

274
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,105
It's detective bribery.

Would you just get the coke?

C'mon, Missy. We had your eyes
surveilanced for weeks.

326

Homicide. You got people making
deliveries here?

336
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,216
We got different guys making deliveries.
Different days, different guys.

00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,083
Just one in Tuesday?

338
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,218
Different terms of day, different guys.

339
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,262
Late afternoon.

340
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,231
We don't keep track of who takes what to
where.

341
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,259
Is there a delivery boy who hasn't show
up for a little while?

342
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,252
Excuse us, hello!

343
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:49,062
Police department. We're looking for
Binnie Rogers.

344
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,236
- I'm Binnie Rogers.
- We need to talk to you for a second, Ms. Rogers.

345
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,171
Do you mind stepping in the hall?

346
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,204
No, well I can't step into the hall.
Can't you see this legs that leaves me here.

347
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,014
We're looking for your grandson, Ms. Rogers.

348
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,176
What are you looking for him for?

349
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,043
Just to talk. We just wanna talk.

350
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,146
Did he do something wrong?

351
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,057
He might've been a witness to a crime.

352
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,058
I don't know anything about that.

353
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,118
Where can we find him?

354
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:21,188
Young man. What do you think gives you
the right to come into my room...

355
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:26,159
...and have a conversation without even
acknowledging my presence.

356
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,068
We're terribly sorry.

357
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,074
It's very important we talk to this
woman's grandson.

358
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,041
And she told you she doesn't know where he is.

359
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,173
Actually, she hasn't told us that.

360
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,204
I don't know

361
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:43,248
Sorry, grandma.

362
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,094
What do you want to know?

363
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,155
Did you make a delivery, Tuesday?

364
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,189
On Josephine and Denilson?

365
00:28:59,003 --> 00:28:59,162
Uh huh.

366
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,105
What did you see there?

367
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,207
This is a 15 year old boy, Sir.

368
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,141
We need you to tell us what you saw there.

369
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,238
He don't get involved in drugs, and gangs.
He goes to school.

370
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,176
He hold down a job and he come home.

371
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,211
A family was murdered, mam.

372
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:21,055
And I feel very bad about that, but I
don't want my grandson involved in it.

373
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,119
Maybe your grandson have some feeling on
his own.

374
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,206
The lady told me to set the grocery bag
in the kitchen.

375
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:43,113
As I send the grocery bag down there, I
heard screaming. Then i heard gun shots.

376
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,080
So I hid in the closet.

377
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,279
When I came out, everyone was all dead.

378
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,993
Did you see her shot then?

379
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,073
Yes or No?

380
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,083
This is what we're looking for.
The name is Donald Godshaw.

381
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,016
Street name Big Fate.

382
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,248

narcotics and possesion of automatic weapon.

384
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,128
We believe he's also behind at least 3 homicides.

385
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,061
Including the Ndele Family.

386
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,125
Lieutenant, would you show us some victims?

387
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,037
All three were possible witnesses.

388
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:47,177
Godsha has two floggies that he runs with.
DeShaun Hackett. Street name "Midget".

389
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:54,083
Has a girlfriend on Burgundy. We'll set
up surveillance all the block. Maybe
we'll get lucky. He'll turn up.

390
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,084
Gary Jenkins. Street name "G".

391
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:03,126
His grandmother lives in project.
If he's laying low chances are
that's where we'll find him.

392
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,093
Let's bring 'em in.

393
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,084
Give me a minute.

394
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,121
I need access to the property next door.
Do you mind?

395
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,232
That's okay, baby...

396
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,123
What do you need access for?

397
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,295
We have some complaints about
disturbance.

398
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,277
Don't fucking breathe.

399
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,040
I love it.

400
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,070
I just love it.

401
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,278
I told you everything I know

402
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,124
This is your lucky day, Son

403
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,291
You're the first person we picked up,
you're in the position to help yourself.

404
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,229
- Help myself to what?
- You think you know something...

405
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,095
...about this family that got murdered.

406
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,166
I don't know nothing, man.

407
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,100
You were in the apartment when the
African got shot.

408
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,003
- Who's with you? Midget, Donald?
- Who?

409
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,996
Donald Godshaw. Big Fate.

410
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,009
- Where is he? Where can we find him?
- I don't know no Big Fate.

411
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:09,046
We find him on our own, we don't need
you no more. There's gonna be 5
homicides to answer for,

412
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,105
and Donald's gonna hang 'em on you.

413
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,241
I mean "G" get 10 to 10, you got life.

414
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,176
I don't know nobody name "Midget",
I don't know nobody name "Big Fate".

415
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,099
Renaldo Hayes.

416
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,194
Oh man, it's bad luck.

417
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,065
I keep for over once on a while this kid
throw to somebody on his own team.

418
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:42,010
I love the guy. By the end of the
fucking game. I'm starting to hate him.
What do you want for the weekend.

419
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,206
- What's to spend on Lousiana and Arkansas?
- 4.

420
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:49,085
Lousiana, minus 4 for a dime.

421
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,220
You got it.

422
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,278
I got a favor to ask.

423
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,023
My kid got a speeding ticket.

424
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,287
I can take care of it
if you give me 0.5 point.

425
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,024
You're gonna grind me for helping out my kid?

426
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,031
Grind you?
You're a funny guy, you know that?

427
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,024
There's guys getting half a point on the
street for nothing. Who lying to you.

428
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,205
Alright.

429
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,064
But you take care of it.

430
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,133
Hello

431
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,195
I'm Lieutenant McDonagh.
New Orleans homicide.

432
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,037
What can I do for you?

433
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,032
A friend of mine's daughter got a ticket
for speeding.

434
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,079
She was doing 75 on the way to the
hospital to visit her grandmother.

435
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:54,084
Has a couple of minor, minor moving
violation in the past. She's in danger
of losing her license.

436
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,143
- What do you want me to do?
- I'd like you to take care of it for me.

437
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,120
You come out to the scene of an accident
just to ask me that?

438
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,090
We got both parts to submit.
It shouldn't be a problem.

439
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,191
Are you asking me to break the law?
Is that what you're doing here?

440
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,284
Are you asking me to break the law?

441
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,155
I'm asking you one cop to another
to do me a favor.

442
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,135
- The answer is no.
- Just like that?

443
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,161
Just like that.

444
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,132
Isn't this the same police department
my father was in?

445
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,006
Will you excuse me.

446
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,079
Right. Guardian of the flame, right?

447
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,014
Fucking ass.

448
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,107
Get back in your car, Lieutenant.

449
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,219
Or else what?

450
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,219
Hey there.

451
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,147
Hey, what are you doing here?

452
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,117
- You know, the lieutenant, officer?
- Yes, we used to work together.

453
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,220
Why don't you walk him back to his car.

454
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,998
I could've told not to bother with that
asshole.

455
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,171
If you need a ticket fixed, why didn't
you come to me?

456
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,230
I didn't know you work here

457
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:54,077
They only let me out on patrol when
they're shorthanded. Or else they got
me in the property room.

458
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,206
Property room? What are you doing tonight?

459
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,077
- You're asking me out?
- Yes, I am.

460
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,101
Hey.

461
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,210
You like this boots, don't you?

462
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,053
Who cares who bought it on you, you
know that.

463
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,083
- You horny?
- Oh yeah.

464
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,087
No, you're not.

465
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,126
Yeah true.

466
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:31,998
Whenever I take prescription except for
the heroin.

467
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,235
Hey! Wake up McDonagh.

468
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:42,242
You know there's times I can't get what
I need with the prescription.

469
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,289
- Really?
- Yeah.

470
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,184
My back hurts sometimes

471
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:54,028
Maybe there's something I can do to make
that pain go away.

472
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,967
You definitely can.

473
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,035
What's that, baby? What do you want me
to do for you.

474
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,062
Check out your property room.

475
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:11,038
See if there's any Oxycotin or morphine
that you can sneak out of there.

476
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:16,151
Just make sure you get rid off the
voucher copy.

477
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,280
You're nuts.

478
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,074
It's gonna be more complicated than I
thought.

479
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,071
You're kidding me.

480
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:51,088
The best thing to do is now have a plead
not guilty. By the time a court date
comes around, I'll talk to cover up.

481
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,181
I thought that's what you're gonna do.

482
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,020
I went straight to the lieutenant.

483
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,222
It'll work out. It's just gonna take a
little longer.

484
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:07,033
Kinda calls in the question 'half a
point for nothing' concept don't you
think?

485
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:12,174
- You're some cheap freak, you know that?
- You say you gonna do something, you dont do it.

486
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,203
Good. Charge me for that point.

487
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:20,081
And, after last weekend, you're down $
3, 000.

488
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:26,223
You might I mean might have thought to
bring me little something?

489
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,188
2 Dimes. On Louisiana against Georgia.

490
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,069
Okay. You got it.

491
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,003
- How long has he been in there?
- About 20 minutes.

492
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,108
- Who else?
- His girlfriend at least one.
That's as far as we know.

493
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,086
What are these fucking Iguanas doing on
my coffee table?

494
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,249
- They ain't no Iguana.
- Yeah, they are.

495
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,218
It ain't no iguana.

496
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,188
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.

497
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,192
Are we set up?

498
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,267
- SWAT is around the corner.
- No.

499
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,137
No. No SWAT. Let them stay there.

500
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,005
Well the Duty Captain said he want to
coordinate with us when we...

501
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,977
Is that right, Stevie? Is that what
you're fucking doing now? Reporting back
to the fucking Duty...

502
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,137
I'm telling you what he said.

503
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,216
We need SWAT, we'll call 'em.

504
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,108
Let's go.

505
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,970
- Who else is in here?
- Nobody.

506
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,266
We don't come back everyday, you
understand?

507
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,978
One times we come back, you want
chances that child getting shot.

508
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,237
Ain't nobody here.

509
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,118
He's hiding back there in the armoire.

510
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,153
You all stay with her. Armand.

511
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,271
Get out. I said get out.

512
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,112
Damn, man

513
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,209
You know, it's always nice to see
intact family.

514
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:20,245
Father want as his obligations, as far
as the children are concern.

515
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:27,257
Less the important thing. You maybe
hiding in an armoire. But your child
knows you're here.

516
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,166
- Are you trippin' man?
- Armand give us some air, would you?

517
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,135
And shut the door.

518
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,136
Shut up.

519
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,193
Shut the door.

520
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,072
Sit down.

521
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,176
Relax, take a sit.

522
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,175
Now we can talk.

523
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,179
- You dont mind if I light one up, do you?
- Fuck, man.

524
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,023
I find it relaxes me.

525
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,223
What the fuck, man.

526
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:04,257
You know we got your boy. "G" right?

527
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,228
Man, I don't know no "G".

528
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,073
He knows you.

529
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:17,045
It's amazing how much you can get done
when you got a simple purpose guiding
you through life.

530
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:27,251
My purpose is to find out who shot up
this apartment, on Josephine.

531
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,126
I know the guy is from Senegal,

532
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,086
I know he was selling heroin,

533
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,225
I know whose territory he was stepping on.

534
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,100
I know who went over to the apartment to
straight him out.

535
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,070
I found out all that in the past few days.

536
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,007
Where's Big Fate, Son?

537
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,179
I don't know no Big Fate.

538
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,238
You see, I know that's not true.

539
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,209
Because everybody who comes from where
you come from does know who Big Fate is.

540
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,015
The fact that you're lying to me about
it, tells me you're hiding something.

541
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:03,220
Since you know my only reason for being
here is to find out who shot up the
apartment I know that's what you're

542
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:04,152
See, it all...

543
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,097
It all comes back to that same simple
purpose.

544
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,197
Man,

545
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,033
I ain't telling you shit.

546
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,184
Hey, what's wrong?

547
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,254
Your father was mad at me because I
can't take care of his fucking dog

548
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,191
Why he had you to take care of it?

549
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,030
Because he's going back into A. A.

550
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,071
He says he can't deal with anymore
responsibility.

551
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,266
Besides, he's gotta stop drinking.

552
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:59,082
I mean gotta take care of it, but I leave
at 7 o'clock in the morning to go to work.

553
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,277
Let me talk to him.

554
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,181
I tried to be good wife to him,
Terrence. I do.

555
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,089
But you know I got a limit too.

556
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,093
He says he got a drinking problem

557
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,055
He wants to do something about it,
that's good.

558
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,001
He's been down that road before, It
didn't take, he wants to try it again.
Good.

559
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:29,068
I said why don't just take beer the way
I do. He says he can't do that.

560
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,181
- Hey, Pop.
- How are you doing?

561
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,084
- You said the meeting is at 7.
- I'd like to get there early. Set up the chairs.

562
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,085
I'll take it.

563
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,120
She can do it.

564
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,248
I came over to see you let me take you
for a ride at least.

565
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,260
You feed the dog?

566
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,064
You feed the dog?

567
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,164
I can take care of it.

568
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,065
What are you talking about?

569
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:57,039
Genevieve told me a little about what's
going on and I'll take the dog off your
hands for a while.

570
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,139
And how you're gonna take care of a dog?

571
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:03,078
I got a friend. She just loves animal.
All of them. Dogs too.

572
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,239
Let's go

573
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,216
Have a good time

574
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,136
No, no

575
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,047
Fuck you.

576
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,080
Fuck you.

577
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,246
Can we not discuss this on the phone?

578
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,184
How come you only come when you need
something?

579
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,127
You're fucked up, aren't you?

580
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,994
What? Yeah... yeah...
I'm fucked up.

581
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:56,260
What are you doing?

582
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,261
I'm going to work.

583
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:01,032
I've to go to "Bloxxy" tonight. Going
to the hotel casino.

584
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,201
Well how are you gonna take care of the dog if
you're fucked up, and you're going to "Bloxxy"?

585
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,245
The doorman is gonna walk him in the
morning and get back in the afternoon?

586
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,110
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

587
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,051
You don't know his name?

588
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,157
That's my father's

589
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,116
You are unbelievable.

590
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,191
I gotta get going.

591
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,152
Unbelievable.

592
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,132
Baby, nice to me.

593
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,166
He smells.

594
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,295
He needs a bath.

595
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,040
Did you try to understand something. It doesn't
matter that you're just along for the ride.

596
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,237
It doesn't matter that you didn't
actually shoot anybody.

597
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,007
You're playing "The Price is Right" now.

598
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:48,074
The price is Big Fate gain off lights gonna help
D.A. convict you and your boy "G".

599
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,143
I guarantee you that's just the way he's gonna do.

600
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,085
- The piss smoke at, man.
- What are you talking about.

601
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,252
Might as well get fucked up I gotta
listen to all this bullshit.

602
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,052
- So break out the smoke, man.
- You flippin' out on us, Midget?

603
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:03,223
Nah, man. Your partner lid up a motherfucking
blunt before you put the cuffs on.

604
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,123
I love this guy.

605
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,169
What did you say? You saying I smoke
Marijuana in your presence.

606
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,231
Cannabis? Is that what you're saying?

607
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,073
Yeah, right.

608
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,203
Your word against mine, so the fucker
won't believe me, right?

609
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:21,107
Lieutenant, can you step out for a
moment?

610
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:42,262
My name is Eugene Gratz, Lieutenant.
I'm an attorney.

611
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,041
This is my client, Donald Godsha.

612
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,135
I understand you've been looking for him.

613
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,112
How can I help you?

614
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,223
I just wanna talk to these guys for a
second. Why don't you wait in there?

615
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,033
Gentlemen.

616
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,075
- Can I get you a glass of water?
- No, thanks.

617
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,015
I got to turn over the names of my
witnesses to my lawyer

618
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,148
Once I do that,

619
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,152
Godshaw look to scare the kid

620
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,245
He can't scare him, he kill him.

621
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,189
I'll never get to him.

622
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,993
Since Godshaw turn himself in, I've
authorized 24 hour to start immediately.

623
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:42,124
Just remember, we have no fingerprints,
no DNA, no weapon.

624
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,160
We lost the kid, we lose the case

625
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,163
Understood?

626
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,114
He's a nice dog, but I just can't keep him.

627
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:04,247
She said she'd be back at one o'clock
this afternoon. I'm off at 4, and I
have anotherjob I gotta be at.

628
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,016
- She didn't call?
- No.

629
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:10,252
And I ain't gonna walk him. And I just
can't leave the animal on her apartment,
It might do damage.

630
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:14,093
- How do you get my number?
- Ms. Frankie gave it to me. In case of emergencies.

631
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,033
Emergencies.

632
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,041
This is what I'm talking about.
Doesn't pick up the phone.
Isn't where she's supposed to be.

633
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,177
Not showing up.

634
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,208
Terence, did you think you can put me
on the witness stand by May 15th.

635
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:34,276
I don't know. Why?

636
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,020
My mom goes for the parole board.

637
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,020
I'm sure we can get people to put in a
good word for her.

638
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,229
Hello

639
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,026
Where are you?

640
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,067
Okay, I'm about an hour from there.

641
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,999
I'm on my way.

642
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:58,139
Frankie, I'm on my way.

643
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,236
You ever been to "Bloxxy"?

644
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,030
Okay, You stand there. Don't move.

645
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,168
I'll be back in five minutes

646
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,000
- Baby.
- Hi, Baby...

647
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,138
What are you doing?

648
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,263
You alright?

649
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,278
You okay?

650
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,074
Who did it?

651
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,122
- Do you have anything for me?
- Some coke.

652
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,192
- That's it?
- And Vicodin.

653
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,025
I'll take both.

654
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,100
What the fuck is going on in here?

655
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,132
Who is this?

656
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,109
Get easy.

657
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,202
Just get my money. He never paid.

658
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,271
- What are you, jealous boyfriend?
- Shut the fuck up.

659
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:46,983
Just get me my money.

660
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:47,984
I used to pay when I'm done.

661
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,246
Done smacking her around?

662
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,255
It was out of chip, man.
I didn't hurt her.

663
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,116
Terence, let's just go.

664
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,061
We don't hit woman down south.

665
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,064
You just made a big mistake there.

666
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,193
My father is Andy.
You wanna get rid of him?

667
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,098
Who?

668
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:09,033
- One of the biggest developers in the Gulf Coast.
- Congratulations.

669
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,040
Tommy Leonardi is one of his best friends.

670
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,065
Hey listen to me, scumbag!

671
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,009
Don't try to impress me with your father
knows some guinea hood.

672
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,045
What you gotta take away from this experience.

673
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:22,048
Is if you ever see that girl again? You
turn around and you walk in opposite
direction. You got that?

674
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:27,979
I had you just looking at that girl,
you gonna wish you were born without a dick.

675
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,120
Big mistake.

676
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:45,072
Big mistake

677
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,992
Daryl, this is Frankie, Frankie, this is Daryl.

678
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,229
- Hi Daryl.
- Hi.

679
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,119
I gotta go talk to someone.

680
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:36,149
You go and take Frankie to the coffee
shop, and you stay with her.

681
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,186
- You can do that, right?
- Yeah.

682
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:42,062
- Do you have to do that now?
- I'll be with you in a minute.

683
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,996
Let's go. Take care of me.

684
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,008
- What Louisiana go off at?
- 3 points underdogs.

685
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:55,201
3 points underdogs

686
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,176
- What are they losing by?
- 8.

687
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,114
- How the fuck is that?
- There's still 2 minutes to play.

688
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,021
Louisiana ain't got his passing game, friend.

689
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,256
Good point.

690
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,279
You want my pick for the "Pac-10"?

691
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,153
Do I look like I wanna hear em?

692
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,267
Where is the boy?

693
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,239
He went to the bathroom

694
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:13,250
- Are there any bath beside that one?
- Yeah, on the other side.

695
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,115
What's going on?

696
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,188
What he said when he left?

697
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:58,132
He asked me if I'd be okay waiting here
by myself. I said yeah, he said he
gotta go to the bathroom.

698
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,293
- He is a witness to a homicide.
- What?

699
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,026
To 5 homicides. Let's go.

700
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:05,138
- Where are we going?
- To find him.

701
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,055
Where is he?

702
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,017
Binnie, call security.

703
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,219
There isn't gonna be anybody.

704
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,286
Where's your grandson, Binnie?

705
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,257
I don't have to tell you anything.

706
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,002
Yeah, you do.

707
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:47,042
I haven't done anything. My grandson
haven't done anything.

708
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,041
If he don't want to be witness, he
doesn't have to be a witness.

709
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,239
This is bigger than you want to.

710
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,108
It was a massacre.

711
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,988
Children were executed.

712
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,257
Well maybe you should've thought of that before.

713
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,224
I need to know where he is.

714
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:14,030
Young man, I would like to know the
name of your superior.

715
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:22,033
Right now, I walk on about an hour and
half of sleep over the past 3 days.

716
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:26,238
And I'm still trying to remain calm.

717
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:31,248
I'm beginning to think that that's
getting in the way of being effective.

718
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,030
What are you doing?

719
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,141
I want to know where Daryl is.

720
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,167
My God.

721
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,043
Nobody saw me coming.
Nobody knows I'm here.

722
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,080
This old woman gonna run out of air.

723
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:03,209
And you're gonna have a tough time convincing
people that It wasnt you who did it to her.

724
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:10,215
And even if. Even if you convinced them
that you didn't kill her on purpose.

725
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:15,095
You're still gonna have a tough time
selling them that you took care of her
with a fuck.

726
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:20,067
Now, listen to me.
Where the fuck is he?

727
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,231
I said where the fuck is he?

728
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:26,002
He's on an aeroplane.

729
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,169
Ms. Edwin had bought him a ticket.

730
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,145
She sent them to live with her family in
England.

731
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:39,010
It's okay.

732
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,122
There we go, that's it.

733
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,025
That's a good girl.

734
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,094
Let's breathe.

735
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,034
You drop dead you selfish cunt.

736
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,194
You ever think about your kids?
Your grandkids?

737
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,235
Suck it up their inheritance through
that oxygen tube?

738
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,011
And Binnie's fucking intensive care.

739
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:07,146
I hate you, I hate you both

740
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:13,044
Right now, I should've fucking kill you.

741
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,289
You're the fucking reason this country
going down to drain.

742
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,202
Watch out, he is not in a good mood.

743
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,010
Come in.

744
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,051
Have a sit.

745
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,113
Scotland Yard called.
The kid's in England.

746
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,217
Make him a material witness.
Maybe Scotland Yard will hold him.

747
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,185
Can't do that.

748
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,027
He had no involvment with the crime.
He don't want to testify.

749
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,090
We can't compel it.

750
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,131
Well we can still try flipping one of
the three.

751
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:01,035
Yeah you can try all you want.

752
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,004
Nobody flippin' on Godshaw. They're
scared to death.

753
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,267
As of now, all they all are person of
interest.

754
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,165
You gotta let them go.

755
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,172
Come on.
5 homicides and you're letting them go?

756
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:15,116
You weren't supposed to let the kid out
of your sight, Lieutenant. Now you
just be glad that he dont turn out dead.

757
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,083
- This is bullshit.
- Get the hell out of here.

758
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,986
Hey lawyer, you're not the one...

759
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,080
Get out of my office!

760
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,055
- We're risking our lives on the street.
- Easy... easy...

761
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,057
You know what's involved, right?

762
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:31,226
- Take it easy.
- Maybe if we have a prosecutor...

763
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,207
- What happened when you went to see his grandmother.
- I told you.

764
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:51,179
She said that the woman she takes care
are buying a plane ticket and he was on
his way to England, to stay with

765
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,247
- Any incident takes place when you were there?
- What kind of incident?

766
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,257
Any kind.

767
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,986
No.

768
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:03,289
Whatever it is,
you gonna have your story down.

769
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,998
Come on they're gonna public integrity
into this?

770
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,226
What for?

771
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:13,233
The old woman, her son is
United States Congressman.

772
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:22,241
I asked where Daryl was. His
grandmother told me.

773
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:26,244
You didn't at anytime threaten his
grandmother?

774
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,022
No, I did not.

775
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,219
You didn't at anytime threatened
Antoinette Fahringer?

776
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,026
No. I did not.

777
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:42,034
Think you should know form of complaints
been filed. Alleging you cut off...
Mrs. Fahringer oxygen supply.

778
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:46,174
Well who's saying that? Mrs. Fahringer?

779
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,232
Is it true?

780
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,210
I think she might be suffering from a
little dementia.

781
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,077
Is it true?

782
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,276
Absolutely not.

783
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:11,097
I saw 5 of those. I want you to clean
that up.

784
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:18,063
Ned. Excellent. You got my message.
Good. Come on.

785
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:20,267
You got the flowers I sent? How's Jenny?

786
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,174
What the fuck are you talking about.

787
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,147
Stop it.

788
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,148
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

789
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,242
I don't have anything for you.

790
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:32,277
- Then this is a problem.
- Yeah well then it's a problem.

791
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,183
You owe me 5 large, Terrence.

792
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,114
I haven't got it.

793
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:42,120
Give me something, give me goods, if
you dont have cash.

794
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,189
- Give me a gold Rolex.
- Ned please.

795
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,995
I look like I got a gold Rolex?

796
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:50,199
- Dont play me for a fucking stooge, Terrence.
- Will you keep your voice down.

797
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:55,100
- Dont play me for a fucking stooge.
- Are you done?

798
01:06:55,177 --> 01:07:01,116
Do you think these guys care you're a
cop. They will fuck you up just like
everybody else

799
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,277
Let me get something down the Texas game, yeah?

800
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,083
No.

801
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,988
Nothing!

802
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:13,219
You pay what the fuck you owe.

803
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:19,066
I am little late on my rent, is all.

804
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,133
Lieutenant.

805
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:27,036
Somebody name Frankie called.

806
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:55,101
- What's going on?
- All kind of things. Come closer.

807
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:56,231
I'm Dave.

808
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,128
- Who are you?
- Andy.

809
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,141
- Who are you?
- Jeff.

810
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,169
What I want right now is to get this
behind position right.

811
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,044
He wants money.

812
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,216
Who are you?

813
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,048
Sit down.

814
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,213
I told you. I'm Dave.

815
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,182
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.

816
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,159
You make a date with a pretty girl,
you gotta pay.

817
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,129
Dear.

818
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,090
Like this.

819
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:33,230
You see that's it. We engage with another
human being, we remind us we're not alone.

820
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,203
Plus who knows maybe we even learned a
little something.

821
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,008
How much?

822
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,073
You took 10 off to make it right, you
gotta come up with 50.

823
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,082
Bullshit.

824
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,245
It's punitive damages.
What can I tell you.

825
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,983
- I don't get it.
She kept up her end of the bargain.
- He says no.

826
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:51,057
He's a fucking liar. I did everything
he asked me to do.

827
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:56,292
- Which was what?
- You want details? Sick people.

828
01:08:57,099 --> 01:09:02,036
Listen to her stand up for herself.
The indignation. I love it.

829
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,002
- Where's the money?
- My bag.

830
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,110
It's all here.

831
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:15,115
Here are 5,000 and some changes here.

832
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,110
Why dont I give you this and call it a day.

833
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,181
We could do that alternatively I could
tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.

834
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,184
You want me to shoot the fucking dog?

835
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,994
I'll put my calling card on this gorgeous.

836
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,090
I don't give a shit about the dog.

837
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,195
But you mark her up, I'm gonna have a
tough time getting you your money.

838
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,262
By my money you mean $ 50,000.

839
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:40,275
- I need a couple of days.
- By couple you mean two?

840
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:41,243
Yeah.

841
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,008
Good

842
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,014
I know, relax.

843
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:51,252
The boys wanna saddle her up just in the
spirit for friendliness. You mind?

844
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:54,085
Well, gotta let her clean up.

845
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,087
Put on something hot.

846
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,183
- She looks like shit right now
- Beautiful.

847
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,086
What are you waiting for?

848
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:07,159
I don't wanna play pressure on you, but
she has a client coming over in 15 minutes.

849
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:10,068
You boys can be done by then, right?

850
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,005
- The both of us?
- They'd been done in 15 seconds
if you havent mention it.

851
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,210
My mistake.

852
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:20,080
You'll hear it when we come back.
Two days, same time same station, yes?

853
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,040
Ok, you got it baby.

854
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:25,151
Don't make me look for you Terrence.

855
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,053
They're gone.

856
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,258
You're taking him to my father's house.

857
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:10,089
Frankie.

858
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,225
They're gone.

859
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,304
I can't take care of them.

860
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:26,070
I just need a place where she could stay
for a couple of days.

861
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,049
Why can't you put her in your place.

862
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,247
I can't take a chance this guy found out
where I live, dad. Come on.

863
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,180
Christ!

864
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:39,125
I get me ajob for bringing the cookies to the
meeting. It takes me half a day to get it done.

865
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,253
You want me to babysit a prost?

866
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,188
You dont have to babysit her.

867
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:45,999
She's very self sufficient.

868
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,062
I'm not in any kind of shape to take on
something like this.

869
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:55,142
I get home from one meeting, I lie on a
couch and I wait.

870
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:58,206
TiI it's time for the next meeting.
That's all I can do right now.

871
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:03,116
Let your wife deal with her.
They'll get along like sisters.

872
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,213
Get away from me, you fag.

873
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,249
My husband's trying to quit drinking and
you bring this shit into our house?

874
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:16,129
Give that back, lady or I swear to God,
I will stab you in the heart.

875
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,166
- What's this?
- What kind of trash you bring in here, Terrence?

876
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,192
She's going through my bag.
My personal shit.

877
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,038
Everybody calm down.

878
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:27,133
- Give it to me.
- He got to put up with narcotics under his nose.

879
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:31,043
Oh God, Come on, it can't be any worse than
you're being shitface on beer all the time.

880
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,014
You told her I'm shitface all the time?

881
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,017
No

882
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:38,076
It's pretty fucking obvious, lady.

883
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:41,051
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

884
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,990
Well, fucking whore. Watch this.

885
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,083
Come fucking get it.

886
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,155
I can't deal with this shit.

887
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,026
Terrence.

888
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,097
We come in or you come out?

889
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,168
Alright. Come on let's go

890
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,281
Francesca Donnenfeld. You know her?

891
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,108
Just cut the bullshit, and tell me what
you're here for.

892
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:14,078
I'm Yasco. Here's the thing tough guy.
You just keep fucking with the wrong people.

893
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,123
First, the old lady.

894
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,020
Now, your prostitute friend customer.

895
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,286
The old lady, you might have written
out. She didn't remember so good.

896
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:24,122
The colored nurse, She's covering for
the grandson, whatever.

897
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:30,067
But when I get a call from a chief of
D's office. That you're shaken down
your prost friend's customer.

898
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,231
Whose father is hung all the way from
here to fucking city hall.

899
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,102
You're done, Lieutenant.

900
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,080
What do you want?

901
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,014
Your gun for starters.

902
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,144
Huh.

903
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:55,060
Until the outcome of the hearing,
you're on modified duty.

904
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,188
Better call your delegate.

905
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,059
You have a good day, Lieutenant.

906
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,240
I didn't have a gun.

907
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:22,121
I know, look you cut the best deal you can
and you get to handle the police department.

908
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,016
Because if you stay in,
it's gonna get worse.

909
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,194
Terrence, can I talk to you for a second.

910
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,020
I can't stay here.

911
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,191
I didn't take the shit from my own mother.
And I'm not gonna take it from her.

912
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:36,103
Hey, Dad. Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?

913
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,073
She's gonna calm down. I promise.

914
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,203
I'm so happy you're here.

915
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,239
I got something else I wanna show you.

916
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:15,169
I wanna show you this place.
I spent a lot of time here...

917
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,144
When I was a boy.

918
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,205
I was here alone a lot.

919
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,219
This was my special place...

920
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,249
...as a child.

921
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,217
My castle.

922
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,992
And I would imagine things here.

923
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,257
Pirates, buried treasures.

924
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,258
My dad didn't like that so much,

925
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,031
But my mom, she got it.

926
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,132
Before she died.

927
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:47,004
She bought me a metal detector.

928
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,041
I wanna show you something.

929
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,169
Look at that. Right out there.

930
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:56,006
I thought that pirates came up the
Mississippi,

931
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,985
And that they bury treasure right there
by that tree...

932
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,086
Next to the house.

933
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,991
I took the metal detector my mom gave me.

934
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:09,096
And I went out there and it started
beeping like 'Beep'... 'Beep'... 'Beep'.

935
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,189
I started digging, and I I dug and I
dug and I dug...

936
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:17,003
And I found a sterling silver spoon.

937
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,169
And I was so happy I started screaming,
and jumping and laughing.

938
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,269
And I went
"Hey Man... this is treasure".

939
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,201
"This is Pirate's treasure."

940
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,105
And I came back here with it.

941
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,052
And I hid it somewhere. I just
Sterling silver spoon.

942
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:33,988
I still can't find it.

943
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,184
It could be anywhere.

944
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,195
I know it's here.

945
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,133
I don't know what to tell you,
Terrence.

946
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,102
Not a lot I can do in this
circumstances.

947
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,246
I tell you guys all the time, you can
not get away with that cowboy shit
anymore.

948
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,052
You don't listen,
and now this is what we had.

949
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:13,059
My best fucking detective, and I gotta
put him in the property room.

950
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:40,220
Terrence, come on.

951
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,083
I don't wanna get you in full of orders.

952
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:47,220
You do all this Fonz shit, and I'm
here, they're gonna think I'm doing it
too.

953
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:51,157
So who go to the storage house when
you're not here?

954
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:55,265
While you're there, get my. 45 Magnum
and bring it to me.

955
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,011
- Hey.
- Hey.

956
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,180
- You work here?
- Looks that way.

957
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:07,203
Why do you got there?

958
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,118
9-10 grams of heroin, and Glock 9.

959
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,283
You see that scale over there?
It's broken.

960
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,150
Useless.

961
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,223
I sent for a new one, as soon it gets here.

962
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,233
I'll weigh the drugs, and I'll get you
your voucher, okay?

963
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,169
Alright, bye bye...

964
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,170
How may I help you, Sir?
May I help you, Sir?

965
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,212
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Excuse me.

966
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,247
You mind stepping outside?
I'd like to talk to you.

967
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,184
You interrupted my meal.

968
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:57,155
I'm gonna pretend to be polite, suit
you like a big man in front of your
friends.

969
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,994
But you give me hard times...

970
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,094
...I put the cuffs on you, just like
any other shit bird.

971
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,131
I'll be back.

972
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:09,166
- You alright?
- What the fuck you wanna talk to me?

973
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,236
You ain't gonna shoot me,
are you motherfucker?

974
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,247
Why would I do that?

975
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,216
I got something for you and I think
you're gonna like it.

976
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,116
Let's take a walk.

977
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,192
You're crazy for coming down here.

978
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,233
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make some money the old fashion way.

979
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,168
With a cop protecting you.

980
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,179
- What I need protection for?
- Other cops.

981
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,210
A cop gonna protect me from cops.

982
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,086
You'll know when a supply is under
surveillance,

983
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,079
You'll know when it's safe to make a
pickup, when it's not.

984
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:56,246
What do I gotta give you?

985
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,258
$ 15,000 - shipment.

986
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,220
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I being unfair?

987
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,264
How do I know you ain't looking to set me up?

988
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,190
Tomorrow I'll bring you some information.

989
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,160
Small shit.
You decide if you wanna go to the next step.

990
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,131
What about the murders?

991
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:15,040
You won't give a fuck about them no more?

992
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:20,113
Look at me.
Now look at you. I never did.

993
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,173
I got the weight on that dope, finally.

994
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,181
Thanks.

995
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:01,983
That's all there was?

996
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,026
I'll double check it if you want.

997
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:11,232
Don't matter,
when that's enough for felony.

998
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:13,096
Hey where do you guys get going on today?

999
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,158
Buy and bust on 4th and Ferret.
On Andre's outfit.

1000
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,064
Happy hunting.

1001
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:34,087
Undercover just bustin' on Andre.
4th and Ferret.

1002
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:39,091
- What do you know?
- Man of your word.

1003
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,993
Are you running me back to my car?

1004
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:47,258
Yeah, I need to make a stop first.
Is that alright?

1005
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,195
Yes.

1006
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,158
- This is prime real estate.
- Doesn't look prime.

1007
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:16,121
See that's the point.
Now is the time to get in.

1008
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:17,255
2-3 years from now,

1009
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:22,102
All of this will be river front condos.
Marble floors, health spas...

1010
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,238
By that time, another motherfucker
made all the money.

1011
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,267
Don't be going legit on me now, Big.

1012
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,174
Money is money

1013
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:35,176
Tell you what. You'll be the frontman,
I'll be the power behind the throne.

1014
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,085
Just like we work your 4th grader good.

1015
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,985
Yeah you're right.

1016
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,025
This is a good spot to build condominiums.

1017
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,061
See, I know I like you, man.

1018
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,120
Come on.

1019
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,249
May I ask you to step out of the vehicle

1020
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:54,090
- What I do?
- You bought dope.

1021
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,154
I watched you buy dope,
now stand the fuck up.

1022
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,264
Put your hands on the car

1023
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,132
I didn't buy nothing, man.

1024
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,271
No? What's this?

1025
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:12,143
- Officer, please...
- Please what?

1026
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,012
- I don't how that shit got in there
- You don't?

1027
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,175
- No, Sir.
- Did I put it there?

1028
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:16,150
No, Sir.

1029
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:19,051
- Just some freak occurence?
- Yes, Sir.

1030
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,189
Was that what you're gonna
tell the judge then?

1031
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,158
Maybe you'll get lucky, and he'd be a
football fans.

1032
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:28,218
- You know who I am.
- Oh, I know who you are.

1033
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:31,061
Then why you wanna fuck my life for?

1034
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,226
I gotta spend a night and that's gonna
knock me out the draft.

1035
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,202
I'm sure you'll get a contract or some
kind eventually, Shit!

1036
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:37,129
You run the 4th and what?
4-3?

1037
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:40,975
Why did you do this to me?

1038
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,237
Because of some motherfucking marijuana, man?

1039
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,241
I was gonna buy my mama a house.

1040
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:47,979
So.

1041
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,047
You're going off 6 points favor against Texas.

1042
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:55,079
You win by 5 or less, or you lose
altogether. None of this ever happened.

1043
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,248
Sir, I I can't do that.

1044
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,029
A fumble on this assignment.
You can absolutely do it.

1045
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,123
Sir, please please don't make me...

1046
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:06,133
Now, listen to me Renaldo.

1047
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,999
I've thrown a lot of money this year...

1048
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,071
...on you. I gotta chance
to get some of that back,

1049
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:15,202
I want to take advantage of it. You're
gonna tell me your integrity game is too
much to you, Fine...

1050
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:19,202
...I respect that. When a dream of
trying to convince you to go against
your concience.

1051
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:21,205
So turn around, I'm placing you under arrest.

1052
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,085
You...

1053
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:27,212
You won't tell nobody.

1054
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,225
You ain't gonna tell nobody.

1055
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,089
This Taliban shit.
That's what this is.

1056
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,092
This does show Osama get a motherfucker
before they blow themselves up.

1057
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:15,262
That's money.

1058
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,094
Shut up!

1059
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:21,130
Where's the 15,000?

1060
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:24,010
You'll get it, man. Relax.

1061
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:28,147
Did I not do what I said I was going to do?

1062
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,218
Yo, man. Relax.

1063
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,156
Tell me again to relax.

1064
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:40,151
I'm not looking to beat you, man.

1065
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,162
Where's my money?

1066
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,063
- I'll get your money
- When?

1067
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,123
- Tomorrow.
- Where?

1068
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,092
My place.

1069
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:51,197
Give me a cut of the uncut dope.

1070
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,038
Look. I'm gonna pay you in money.

1071
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,101
This is interest.

1072
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,077
That's bullshit, man.

1073
01:26:57,245 --> 01:27:01,147
- What's that little man?
- Yo, Midge, chill out.

1074
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,109
Here.

1075
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:09,156
Now put that gun away.
Before you kill somebody.

1076
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:16,222
I'll kill all of you.
To the break of dawn.

1077
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:25,072
To the break of dawn, baby.

1078
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:29,009
What's up?

1079
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,239
What's up? What's up? What's up?

1080
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,146
- No, don't talk to me...
- What's up motherfucker?

1081
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:35,172
...about no fucking bet, Terrence.

1082
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:36,205
Now what's the matter?

1083
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,985
You don't pay your debts, I don't
wanna know you. I can't afford it.

1084
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:45,148
Ten grand. 5 by 0. Yeah? All for
Louisiana. Right there.

1085
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:50,025
- Where did you get this?
- What are you my priest?

1086
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:56,127
- That's a 6 point spread.
- No shit.

1087
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,032
Frankie!

1088
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:11,173
Frankie!

1089
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,991
- Hi.
- Hi.

1090
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,022
- I got something for you.
- I need to get my clothes.

1091
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:28,058
Don't worry about your clothes right
now. This is uncut dope.

1092
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,231
Just a bunch of stuff from my closet,
and then from my dresser by the bed.

1093
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:36,209
I'm not gonna give you much until we know
how strong it is. 'Coz it's pure, you know?

1094
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:41,978
Baby, I've been talking to your father a lot.
And I think I'm gonna go to the meeting with him.

1095
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,177
Does that mean you don't want any?

1096
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:51,225
I mean, of course I want some but I,
maybe when I get back.

1097
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,158
Frankie,

1098
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,121
- Ready?
- We gotta go.

1099
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,090
Okay.

1100
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,081
Thank you

1101
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,171
This is the way to do business.

1102
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:24,014
This? This way I ain't gotta worry about
what I'm walking into. I got you.

1103
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,147
Let me hit that shit

1104
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:38,259
Yeah.

1105
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,164
You eatin' this shit?

1106
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:49,972
Hey, Midget.

1107
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:53,046
Light the Caucasion's swag.

1108
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:02,147
You're my kind of motherfucking cop,
man.

1109
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:05,122
You look crazy, motherfucker.

1110
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:10,196
- Why do you care?
- I'm guessing $ 60,000.

1111
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,064
- Pretty good guess.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

1112
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:15,065
You owe me 15,000.

1113
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:17,264
I'll take 25% of the dope uncut.

1114
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:19,061
That means you're getting my price.

1115
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,266
There's one way of looking at it.

1116
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:26,076
The other is you get to keep 75%, and I
go to prison for the rest of your life.

1117
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,224
Make sure you cut it before you sell it.

1118
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,156
Unless you wanna kill the motherfucker
who buys it.

1119
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:42,094
Hey, did I ever tell you story about
Nigger Elk. Nigger Elk, yeah?

1120
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:44,063
I was watching TV, The game, right?

1121
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:45,065
When Renaldo Hayes, he got tossed upon,

1122
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,064
He was running with it, running,
running, running.

1123
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:49,068
He jumped over 3 linebacks and in mid air...

1124
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:53,072
He spouted antlers like a gizelle, like an elk.

1125
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:57,044
He landed again, he ran, ran ran.
He scored a touchdown.

1126
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,183
I'm not worried about you so I'll be
concern about me.

1127
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:06,118
'cos I'm not concern, You're not
concern, So don't worry 'cos...

1128
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:07,279
I'm not really concern.

1129
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:12,254
I'm worried, because if you drop dead,
I'm the motherfucker they come looking for.

1130
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:16,253
And then I gotta end up having a nigger
from Africa trying to move in on my shit.

1131
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,125
I don't wanna shot no more purple ass
niggers from Africa.

1132
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:23,067
- You understand?
- Easy... Easy... 'coz I'm not Eazy-E.

1133
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,176
- I need to go to the store.
- So?

1134
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:32,268
So I need you to watch him.

1135
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,241
Well. Fuck No! I can't watch him!

1136
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:37,183
Well don't be yellin', They ain't
nothin' to eat then.

1137
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:39,244
Get the fuck out of here.

1138
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,050
Get the fuck out of here.

1139
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,281
Hit me again with another one of them rocks.

1140
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,216
Now what the fuck is that?

1141
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:51,028
It's my lucky crack pipe.

1142
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:53,122
You're a crazy motherfucker.

1143
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,132
You don't have a lucky crack pipe?

1144
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:56,230
No.

1145
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,006
I don't have a lucky motherfucking crack pipe.

1146
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,199
Well then, Donald.
You gotta take a hit off from mine.

1147
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:03,110
Why I gotta do that?

1148
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,104
'Cause it's lucky.

1149
01:33:22,196 --> 01:33:25,131
Sorry we're late, fellas.
I hope you didn't wait dinner.

1150
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:28,294
- Who the fuck are you?
- 3rd party Ben Fishery.

1151
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,061
Your friend here can feel you
in on the details.

1152
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:34,040
I'm working on getting your money,
Dave. That's what I'm doing here.

1153
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:39,069
Yeah, I don't know about you but I find
the hardest part of collecting debts is
having to listen to the stories.

1154
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:40,171
Wait a minute.
Terrence owes you some money?

1155
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:41,181
Fifty thousand dollars.

1156
01:33:42,049 --> 01:33:46,145
Plus my two young friends here were
supposed to have had a sexual experience
at their choosing...

1157
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:49,045
...with an attractive woman. Nothing!

1158
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,024
He came across with none of it.

1159
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:54,994
Now that's wrong. That's wrong when you
don't do what you say you gonna do,
Terrence

1160
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,224
My end of the dope worths more than $ 50,000.

1161
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,063
Take it.

1162
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:02,195
Why don't I take all the dope?

1163
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,096
What are you gonna take what belongs to me?

1164
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:07,140
Well, there was a time when I wouldn't have.

1165
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:10,142
I'd have taken what's mine
and left the rest on the table.

1166
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:13,036
But you see,
I never got rich enough to retire.

1167
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,145
I'm stuck doing this shit.

1168
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:18,217
And I'm not young anymore.

1169
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:23,018
So now I don't leave nothing on the table.

1170
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:25,158
Pick it up.

1171
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,082
- Kill him again.
- What for?

1172
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:56,020
His soul is still dancing.

1173
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:20,113
Shoot him again.

1174
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:55,139
What are you doing tonight?

1175
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,107
I'm getting out of here and go to bed.

1176
01:35:57,118 --> 01:35:58,176
Well just for fun.

1177
01:35:58,185 --> 01:36:00,119
Why don't you stop writing report on
Josephine?

1178
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,215
- For fun?
- I think you might find something interesting there.

1179
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:04,989
Like what?

1180
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:08,289
I've been thinking this bushwhackers, might've
hit a crack pipe while they were there.

1181
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:13,031
Dropped under the bed where the kids were?

1182
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,100
And we missed it?

1183
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:17,227
The DNA place 'em at the scene.

1184
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,107
Yeah, the vision, right?

1185
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,015
Frankie.

1186
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:09,182
Where's Frankie?
She's not in the house?

1187
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:13,090
- Frankie's on the way to Rehab.
- Rehab?

1188
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:14,261
What about her clothes

1189
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:18,188
Someone bring her, her clothes.

1190
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:22,202
Anything else you wanna know?

1191
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:50,030
You don't have to hide it from me.

1192
01:37:55,135 --> 01:37:56,227
Both like a poison.

1193
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:02,039
You just drink beer, I thought.

1194
01:38:47,187 --> 01:38:53,023
- I'm gonna watch the game.
- Be my guest.

1195
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:19,041
[Sports commentator talking on TV]

1196
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:25,992
...and all this without Renaldo Hayes.

1197
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:30,026
We still don't know the nature of his injury...

1198
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:33,261
I'll kill him.

1199
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:42,099
...you know I'm looking right there...
Hayes And I tell you what.

1200
01:39:42,176 --> 01:39:45,236
The guy just does not look like a happy guy.
I mean he's on the sideline...

1201
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:50,181
He's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury...

1202
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:39,056
First off, This thing between us is
gotten way out hand, my man.

1203
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:40,188
Got way out of hand.

1204
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,168
Okay?

1205
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:46,072
Those goomballs couple fucking assholes.

1206
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,108
I take this because of something
you did to 'em?

1207
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:50,243
Woah, man...

1208
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:53,078
I got no beef with you whatsoever.

1209
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:56,047
Everything between me, rinsed with rain.

1210
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:58,116
I want you to know,

1211
01:40:58,152 --> 01:41:02,179
That my father got in touch with this
guy, and he told like whoever it is,

1212
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:06,216
That complaint has been withdrawn.
Finished. Oh yeah.

1213
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:09,059
Okay?

1214
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:12,258
Okay.

01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:32,243
No... no... Look Ned

1218
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:35,221
If you'd called first I would've save
you the trip. I, I...

1219
01:41:35,222 --> 01:41:39,181
I'm guessing, that you didn't see the game.

1220
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:43,223
How did this happen?

1221
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:47,056
Louisiana by 3.

1222
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:51,001
- Hayes ended up playing?
- Nope.

1223
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:54,172
- Worked out anyway.
- What are you talking about?

1224
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:55,197
Nothing.

1225
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,103
And my daughter's tickets.
Speeding tickets.

1226
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:02,240
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1227
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:06,982
This female highway patrol officer
calls up says they're taken care of.

1228
01:42:10,057 --> 01:42:12,082
It's $ 10,000.
You sure you don't wanna count it?

1229
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:13,091
I trust you.

1230
01:42:14,027 --> 01:42:16,154
- Alright, man. You take care of yourself.
- Alright.

1231
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:20,125
- Great news.
- Why?

1232
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:22,192
Armand came up with this at the crime
scene on Josephine.

1233
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:24,227
I was uh... I just got lucky.

1234
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:28,041
Lab found Godshaw's DNA on it.

1235
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:35,139
That is fantastic!

1236
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,983
Yes!

1237
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:42,989
Oh... Look at that.

1238
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:11,982
I found the spoon.

1239
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:18,014
It's not silver and little rusty.

1240
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:21,084
I want to give it to you.

1241
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,089
It's yours

1242
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:28,157
It's for me?

1243
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:36,075
That's so sweet.

1244
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:49,248
It's beautiful.

1245
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:03,098
Yes, eight.

1246
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:07,163
It's going down, baby.

1247
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,101
I got some help.

1248
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:14,214
Police Department. Stand up.
Keep your hands where we can see em.

1249
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:16,148
- What the fuck is this?
- Shut up!

1250
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:17,081
We got it.

1251
01:44:17,184 --> 01:44:21,018
Check the outside. Check the backyard.
Check upstairs. Check his car.

1252
01:44:21,054 --> 01:44:23,022
We got this. It's okay.
Good. We're good.

1253
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:24,114
- Upstairs.
- Cuff him.

1254
01:44:24,224 --> 01:44:25,088
No!

1255
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:32,030
- No!
- What do you mean no?

1256
01:44:32,065 --> 01:44:35,000
Here's what happens. Before we can cuff
him, he goes for this weapon,

1257
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:36,195
we shoot this prick and steal his shit.

1258
01:44:36,236 --> 01:44:39,967
What the fuck? Terrence...
What are we doing?

1259
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,166
I thought we had our thing going.

1260
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:42,232
And you're wrong, baby.

1261
01:44:42,309 --> 01:44:45,107
He acts like he likes you,
cause he likes to get high.

1262
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:48,078
That don't mean he stops being the police.

1263
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,980
- Cuff him, Stevie.
- No.

1264
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,254
I said "Cuff him, Stevie!"

1265
01:44:55,088 --> 01:44:59,149
This is about money? You want money?
You want my fucking money? Take my money!

1266
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:01,057
But you won't gotta kill me for this shit.

1267
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:02,186
Go for it, Son.

1268
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,263
Go for it.

1269
01:45:03,997 --> 01:45:05,157
Go for it. Go for it.

1270
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:13,103
Next time.

1271
01:45:14,107 --> 01:45:16,041
Now fucking cuff him.

1272
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:22,139
I said cuff the motherfucker, Stevie.

1273
01:45:35,062 --> 01:45:37,223
One year later

1274
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:49,235
Ladies and Gentlemen.
It's an honor to conclude this year

1275
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:51,244
on a positive note.

1276
01:45:51,244 --> 01:45:57,114
In recognition of his leadership, and
tenacity, and the investigation of
Ndele family murders,

1277
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:00,210
resulting in successful apprehension,
and prosecution...

1278
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:03,086
...of the 3 individuals responsible

1279
01:46:03,256 --> 01:46:09,058
So I'm proud to include Lt. Terrence
McDonagh among those being promoted...

1280
01:46:09,062 --> 01:46:10,154
...to the rank of "Captain"

1281
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:13,166
Captain Mc Donagh.

1282
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:40,125
- Excuse me, would you care for some wine?
- No, thank you.

1283
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:43,095
We're all gonna stick
with our sparkling water.

1284
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:47,225
I would like to make a toast.

1285
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:50,127
To the new Captain.

1286
01:46:51,037 --> 01:46:52,061
To new life.

1287
01:46:53,106 --> 01:46:57,099
- I'm probably gonna start to cry right now.
- Aw... That's okay.

1288
01:46:58,211 --> 01:47:00,179
To my new family.

1289
01:47:00,313 --> 01:47:03,180
- God Bless!
- Hear, hear...

1290
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:31,075
You're still gonna working the nightshift
when I get closer to the D-Day?

1291
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:34,173
I'll make sure I'm not. How's that.

1292
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:37,242
I can get to the hospital on my own, but...

1293
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:39,980
But I like having you home at night.

1294
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:42,283
I like it better that way too.

1295
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:53,191
- Stand against the wall.
- What did we do?

1296
01:48:53,226 --> 01:48:55,126
- Hey! Stand against the wall
- Wait!

1297
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:56,217
What are you doing?

1298
01:48:56,263 --> 01:49:00,063
You two match a description.
In passing drugs in a club.

1299
01:49:00,066 --> 01:49:01,260
- Sir. You have the...
- Don't say anything.

1300
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:03,263
Do exactly what I tell you to do.

1301
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,228
So.

1302
01:49:05,272 --> 01:49:07,137
- What are you hiding tonight?
- Nothing.

1303
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:11,075
- We didn't do...
- Empty your pocket and stuffed out the handbag.

1304
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:28,984
- Room Service.
- I didn't order any room service.

1305
01:49:30,163 --> 01:49:34,099
Must've make a mistake again.
Holy shit.

1306
01:49:36,036 --> 01:49:38,027
I'm Evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.

1307
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:41,035
I was in the prison that was flooding, man.

1308
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:43,168
- Oh yeah.
- Do you remember me?

1309
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,203
Are you still with the police department?

1310
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:49,081
Port of Call. Still New Orleans.

1311
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:51,072
Okay.

1312
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,048
What happened with you?

1313
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:56,214
Judge amend me to a drug free program.

1314
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:59,157
November 14th.
I'd have a year clean.

1315
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,125
Congratulations.

1316
01:50:07,133 --> 01:50:09,101
Are you alright?

1317
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:14,234
Sometimes, I had bad days.

1318
01:50:16,242 --> 01:50:19,268
Listen. You saved my life.

1319
01:50:20,213 --> 01:50:23,182
I'm almost done working. I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

1320
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:26,118
Okay?

1321
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:32,283
Does fish have dreams?

1322
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:58,039
You know, Chavez. I still hate that I
ruined my underwear for you.
