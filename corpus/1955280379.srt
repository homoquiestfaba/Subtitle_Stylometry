1
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,684
So if you're just joining us,
I am here with Andrew Kincaid.

2
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:56,255
Brainchild behind sentinel,
the world's most rapidly

3
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,624
growing video game company.

4
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,693
And if I may say so, now,
one of the most powerful

5
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,495
men on the planet.

6
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,697
You recently made
headlines for your

7
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,500
campaign against the
preservation of the right

8
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,669
to bear arms in this
second amendment war

9
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,838
that's been raging
in Washington.

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,211
Complete with catchy slogan,
"keep guns in games."

11
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,381
Well it's something that
I'm very passionate about.

12
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:25,384
We've lost touch with how
lucky we are to be here.

13
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,718
Uh, we piss on the planet.

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:26,718
We piss on the animals, on
nature, and on each other.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,723
And then we raise our fists
in protests for our right

16
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,560
to own a gun while people are
being killed left and right.

17
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,462
And then we delude
ourselves into believing

18
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,697
that gun that we own could
ever match might with the

19
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,799
21st century American military.

20
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,869
Gun ownership in this country
is an obsolete tradition.

21
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,537
It can't protect us anymore.

22
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,607
In fact, it's
clearly hurting us.

23
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,843
Well, certainly a very
traditionalist perspective

24
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,578
to support gun ownership.

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,880
And the number of failed
bills reflects that.

26
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,483
Traditions still stand
strong in America.

27
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,884
That makes me very sad.

28
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:02,387
I mean, what is it gonna take
to get that point across?

29
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,891
And your solution would be to
contain violence to video games?

30
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,828
Well, we're never gonna contain
it, but we can direct it.

31
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,631
You wanna shoot something,
you wanna shoot somebody?

32
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,765
Play a game.

33
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,900
Play one of my games.

34
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,335
Flight's not delayed
like we thought.

35
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,504
Out the door in thirty, okay?

36
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,909
Ors, we are not gonna be able to
sort through all these things.

37
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,546
And speaking of your games,
what can you tell us about

38
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,215
the rumors that your top
security officer, Orson

39
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,485
creed, has been pushing
to move sentinel into

40
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,586
military contracts.

41
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,621
Come on.

42
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:36,755
I dare you.

43
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,490
Orson, we need to go.

44
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,392
Yeah, hold on.

45
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,760
I need to hear this.

46
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,196
And how it can best be
used to serve to public.

47
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,399
Mr. creed and I fall on
different sides of the aisle.

48
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,667
And let's be clear about this.

49
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,869
This is not the first time
he's tried to extract an

50
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,538
intellectual property.

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,807
But I could promise you,
it will be the last.

52
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,644
So Orson creed would be
the one saying...

53
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,213
Under his direction, sentinel
becomes a military

54
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,514
tech developer.

55
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,816
Are you hearing this?

56
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,852
Do you expect anything less?

57
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,556
Marrying ourselves to
tradition has held us back.

58
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,659
People are resistant to
the future, but that

59
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,427
doesn't stop it from coming.

60
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,296
And if it's not me, it's
gonna be the next guy who

61
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,564
takes up the reigns.

62
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,201
At the end of the day,
it's your quarter.

63
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,603
If any of you are unfamiliar
with Mr. Kincaid's

64
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,905
gaming ambitions,
and from the numbers,

65
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,540
there can't be too many.

66
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,245
We've heard of where you think
Mr. creed is going to

67
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,513
take sentinel...

68
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,815
Tell us what you're doing
here, what you've done.

69
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,685
I wanted to take the gaming
world and I wanted to push it.

70
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,387
I wanted to push the inner
activity, the gameplay,

71
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,422
the environment.

72
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,725
Players wanna be in the game.

73
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,760
And right now, we're
closer to that than

74
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:48,760
anyone's ever been before.

75
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,863
Well, you know, some of
your critics have been

76
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,799
pretty vocal about
their issues with that.

77
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,401
Especially given your outspoken
stance against guns.

78
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,403
Yeah, I think you'd be
surprised how many of

79
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,772
those critics have secret
gaming accounts of their own.

80
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,243
Look, I have an issue with
guns on the street and I

81
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,412
think that that issue will
be resolved. So...

82
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,848
Take one more look around.
I'll start the car.

83
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,287
Hey.

84
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,257
I love you for not being him.

85
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,892
In America, we are in the
business of making money.

86
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,494
Come here.

87
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,364
If I can do that while making
my country a little safer?

88
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,499
Buddy, I call that
the American dream.

89
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,769
People are literally
controlled by their phones

90
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,705
and their tablets and
their social networks and

91
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,307
the games that the play.

92
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,313
Abbie!

93
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,950
We live in a world
dominated by technology.

94
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,585
Let her go.

95
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,755
You can call it sad, or you
can call it whatever you want.

96
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:56,828
But you can't argue
one fact, it is now.

97
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,832
Oh...

98
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,033
Just you.

99
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,201
Just me.

100
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,638
Come on.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,740
Thought you might come
outside for this one.

102
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,707
Quit playing around.

103
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,576
Come on.
Give it to me.

104
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,047
Man, when is Kincaid gonna
stop with all the discs?

105
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,849
Yeah, I guess it is kinda
old school for a new

106
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,517
school guy, huh?

107
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,786
Really nice way to say
someone's paranoid.

108
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,022
Says the man who refuses
to leave his house.

109
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,924
Shut up, Bernard.

110
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,126
This is a new adventure.

111
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,094
Stay tuned.

112
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,930
- See ya.
- Mhm.

113
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,089
Right on time, my Princess.

114
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:15,260
Oh, gee. You know how I love
it when you call me Princess.

115
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:19,531
So your highness, how art
thou on this majestic morning?

116
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm good! Another
day at the office.

117
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,969
Jerry brought me crepes
for breakfast this morning.

118
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,871
Jerry. That bastard.

119
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,740
You tell that Jerry
that you're mine.

120
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,141
All mine.

121
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,676
Uh huh.

122
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,278
That would require you to
get out of your house and

123
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
take me out.

124
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,648
Oh, Princess.

125
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,850
How can you resist
my sex appeal?

126
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,089
Oh, nothing sexier than sitting
on the other end of the phone

127
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,791
while your coworker mods
a game against protocol.

128
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:51,630
You know, first of all, that
only happened like three times.

129
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,998
- Four times.
- Whatever.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,301
And second, mods made
the games better.

131
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,936
Uh huh.

132
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,907
Oh right.

133
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,309
Let me give you your moment.

134
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,742
So tell me about this game.

135
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,611
Well, you won't be
modding this game.

136
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,012
I can tell you that.

137
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,714
Okay.

138
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,616
This is the one.

139
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,051
The Kincaid prophecy.

140
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:46,051
The dream game.

141
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:50,221
The one where you get
to be in the world.

142
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,290
Really?

143
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,025
This?

144
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,295
Oh, hey!

145
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,030
Keep talking.
I'm listening.

146
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,765
Just gotta grab my pizza.

147
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,669
Well, you'll be testing
the game frame mostly.

148
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,106
Kincaid isn't ready to
reveal the real tech just yet.

149
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,314
So can you tell me
about it then?

150
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,150
Exactly how are
you in this world?

151
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,886
No comment.

152
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,688
Can we get some comment?
Any comment.

153
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,724
Absolutely no comments.

154
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:25,724
What about the rumors?

155
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,659
He said no comment!

156
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,194
Let's go, let's go.

157
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,796
Hey, did you hear me?

158
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,798
Hello?

159
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,200
Sorry, no.
Uh, let's get started.

160
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,735
We have a lot to cover.

161
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,205
Alright.

162
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,706
Let's do this.

163
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,783
From behind.

164
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,118
Let's go.

165
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,423
Guys, we are on the clock.

166
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,024
Gotta go, gotta go.

167
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,695
Almost got it.

168
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,021
Done!

169
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,122
Done.

170
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,491
What?

171
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:07,459
Pack up the gear.

172
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,060
I'll get the girl.

173
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,798
Come on, boys.

174
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,934
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

175
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,218
Enjoy the ride, old friend.

176
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,964
Style is great.

177
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:26,965
Realistic.

178
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,100
Kincaid wanted a
grounded universe.

179
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:33,071
Meaning real human movement
with a stylized aesthetic.

180
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,907
To distract from the
intense violence no doubt.

181
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,242
You're so smart.

182
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,576
You know.

183
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,249
Can't say I've seen a game
start like this before.

184
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:48,453
No menu, no options, no loading.

185
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,888
Total immersion.

186
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,289
That's the goal.

187
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,534
Man, that looks
like Orson creed.

188
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,270
So?

189
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,139
Guess they designed it
before the total fallen

190
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,074
out of destruction thing.

191
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,609
I guess so.

192
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,486
Ah, it's amazing.

193
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:28,226
Almost like I can see anger.

194
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,661
Pretty good, huh?

195
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,264
Damn good.

196
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,726
I guess I'm supposed
to grab that.

197
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,563
Yup.

198
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,468
Play me.

199
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,303
Cute.

200
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,441
Hey, ors!

201
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,509
Good to see you're up and about.

202
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,279
I bet you're wondering
about now just what the

203
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,247
hell did we do to you.

204
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:27,485
But you should know, how
can the artist forget his

205
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,620
own artwork, right?

206
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:37,228
We've got a series of
tasks for you, ors.

207
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,566
And I can't wait to see
you make it through

208
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,768
because I know you will, buddy.

209
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:49,307
You'll have 90 minutes to
complete each objective.

210
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:53,044
If you fail, ors...

211
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,480
I hope you're listening, buddy.

212
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:59,684
If you fail to finish in
the 90 minute window,

213
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:06,591
you beautiful wife, Abbie,
loses a body part per objective.

214
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,759
K?

215
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,728
Okay.

216
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,063
Mission one.

217
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,465
National bank is
about to be robbed.

218
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:19,203
Your mission is to get
inside, undetected, during

219
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,340
the robbery and retrieve
the contents of safety

220
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:26,044
deposit box 1121.

221
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,479
Do you hear me?

222
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,716
If you're compromised,
it's all over.

223
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:39,123
Think of Abbie,
beautiful, Abbie.

224
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,461
Okay, scout, you
better get a move on.

225
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:48,266
Your 90 minutes begin now.

226
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,472
Heavy.

227
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:58,142
Yet, still has a classic
video game setup.

228
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,145
How can we embrace the new
without acknowledging the old?

229
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,181
True that, true that.

230
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:31,275
Inventory, inventory.

231
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,244
Hit the Grey button.

232
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,348
No inventory menu either?

233
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,884
What, he just pulls out
whatever he has on him?

234
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,253
That's weird, but okay.

235
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,604
Ladies and gentlemen, just in.

236
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,540
We are getting unconfirmed
reports of armed men from

237
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,709
the Southtown branch
of National bank.

238
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,211
No details as of yet.

239
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm told one of our
reporters is sending us

240
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,883
text messages from the scene.

241
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,751
From inside the bank.

242
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,553
Please stand by.

243
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,322
I'm gonna stay on the
line today with you.

244
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,924
Orders straight from the top.

245
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,626
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,594
Why don't you just beam me
with excitement over your

247
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,229
assignment?

248
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,665
Max, I didn't mean it
like that. I mean...

249
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,936
Oh, come on, Princess.
Say it with me... smitten!

250
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,504
Who says that anymore?

251
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,506
I say it.

252
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:36,908
Oh shit.

253
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,413
I wonder if I uh...

254
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,282
Max, stay on the mission.

255
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,883
We're on a time table remember?

256
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,885
Yeah, totally.

257
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,290
Max!

258
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,494
I told you to stay
on the mission!

259
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,696
Well, I guess I don't want
any stars or anything.

260
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,964
Don't do that again.

261
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,966
What? It's just a game.

262
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,467
Relax.

263
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,670
Just having a little
fun, that's all.

264
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,973
Um, yeah. Just remember
the clock is running.

265
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,575
Yeah, right.

266
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh shit.

267
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,924
How the hell am I supposed
to get in there undetected?

268
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,091
- Let's move.
- Dear god, please!

269
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,514
- Please no!
- Stay down!

270
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,050
We see movement,
we start shooting.

271
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,451
Get it?

272
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,820
Open the vault!

273
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,938
Gotta be the manager.

274
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,075
Hey!

275
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,778
Get the bags ready.

276
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,786
What are you doing?

277
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,355
How do I talk to people?

278
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,091
Hit the black button with
the cursor over her.

279
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,795
Hey, baby.

280
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,464
Hey, baby.

281
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,466
What?

282
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,501
Yeah.

283
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,107
I've never seen mpc's
react like that before.

284
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,443
Well it's probably because
you're being a douche.

285
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,811
Oh hey!

286
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,579
Sweetie pie.

287
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,881
Oh, you getting a little
jealous on me or what?

288
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,683
Uh, hardly.

289
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,085
I kinda like it.

290
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,623
I need to access safety
deposit box 1121.

291
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,792
Are you crazy?

292
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:45,596
I need to access safety
deposit box 1121.

293
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,865
Wait, where do I know you from?

294
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,633
I need the keys, ma'am.

295
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,968
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

296
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,637
I need the keys right now.

297
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,673
I don't have them.

298
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,875
They're in my desk.

299
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,677
It's over there.

300
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,083
Well, I think this is two
points for difficulty.

301
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,491
Get down!

302
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,511
Okay.

303
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,980
Bingo.

304
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,082
Oh!

305
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:44,922
What is this?

306
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,657
Is this thing on?

307
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,465
Hey, you got a hot
shot over here.

308
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,501
Drop the gun or you're dead.

309
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,470
3, 2, 1.

310
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,038
Okay, okay!

311
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,937
- I got the bag.
- Sweet!

312
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,939
Tryna murk some mpc's.

313
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:37,208
Stealth is key for
this mission, Max.

314
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,642
Thanks for the tip.

315
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,978
And um, don't kill any hostages.

316
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,546
You'll fail the mission.

317
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,916
Um, someone's being a
little drama queen.

318
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:46,951
Relax.

319
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,220
I can always reload
and auto-save.

320
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,830
Hey, you're all gonna die.

321
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,532
Get him!

322
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,201
Everybody, stay down!
Stay down!

323
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,503
Check right.

324
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,104
Clear.

325
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,953
What was that?
I didn't copy.

326
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,790
Come again.

327
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,196
Smile for the cameras.

328
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,947
I see him!

329
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,003
Knock, knock.

330
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,377
You're dead.

331
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,188
Hey, I'm gonna take
a quick break.

332
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,027
Why won't this damn thing pause?

333
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,430
Uh, I'll look into it.

334
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,234
Well, I'm still taking a break.

335
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,302
Man's gotta take a leak.

336
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,205
We're here with bank
manager, Lillian Brandt,

337
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,275
who is one of the hostages
in this crisis.

338
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:01,245
Can you confirm that he
killed all the suspects?

339
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:06,016
No, he stopped them.

340
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,852
And you're saying this
man is Orson creed.

341
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,220
What the hell?

342
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,222
I didn't recognize him at first.

343
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,824
It was a mess in there.

344
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,326
The Orson creed who was
recently fired following

345
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,296
disputes with sentinel
ceo, Andrew Kincaid?

346
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,464
No.

347
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,833
He saved my life.

348
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,935
I just wish that
I could thank him.

349
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,871
It just seemed like he was
gone as fast as he came.

350
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,777
If you're out there, thank you.

351
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,879
We're awaiting comment
from sentinel and

352
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,715
authorities tell us attempts
to contact Orson creed

353
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,851
- no, this is not right.
- And his wife have failed.

354
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,854
Ladies and gentlemen, you
are as confused as we are.

355
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,789
Stay with us.

356
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,228
Ladies and gentlemen,
these cellphone photos

357
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,898
just came to us from
our source inside.

358
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Uh, it looks pretty convincing.

359
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,937
Orson creed, apparent
hero, leaving the bank

360
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,739
with two million dollars.

361
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,440
As far as we know, the
money has not been

362
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,910
recovered and there is
no sign of Orson creed.

363
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,079
Is everything okay?

364
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,047
I'm calling the police.

365
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:10,948
What!

366
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,249
Max, no!

367
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,150
Max!

368
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,752
9-1-1 operator.

369
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,487
Sit down and play the game.

370
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:16,487
What's going on?

371
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:20,357
I should be asking you that.

372
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,127
I sit down and start
playing this brand new game

373
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,964
and all of a sudden my mission
is on the goddamn news.

374
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,533
- There's no way.
- Calm down, Max.

375
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,101
Calm down?

376
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,336
Calm down.

377
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,806
Just tell me.

378
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,108
Did I just kill a
bunch of people?

379
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,244
You need to listen
to me right now.

380
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,012
You need to keep playing, Max.

381
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,047
Trust me, just keep playing.

382
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,282
You have to.

383
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,151
Not until I figure
out what's going on.

384
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,286
The only thing I'm doing is
turning this damn thing off.

385
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,821
Max, no!

386
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,160
Hello, Max.

387
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,062
No, this is not happening.

388
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,330
Shut up!

389
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:04,535
And listen very, very carefully.

390
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,037
Your life depends on it.

391
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,823
Now let me be perfectly clear.

392
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:30,160
If you, Max, try to call
the authorities, turn off

393
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,363
your console, or
leave the house...

394
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:38,068
Which shouldn't be a
problem for you, right?

395
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,439
We're going to kill your
girl and then we're gonna

396
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,541
tell the cops what you did.

397
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:45,542
What?

398
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,177
What are you talking about?

399
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,279
I'd check your bank account.

400
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,551
I can see it in
the headlines now.

401
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,188
Say it isn't so, Max.

402
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,442
Shit.

403
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,879
I think you get the point.

404
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,047
Now finish the game.

405
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,182
Max.

406
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:26,950
Max.

407
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:31,021
You have to finish the game.

408
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,362
Ors!

409
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,131
I knew you'd make it.

410
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,198
Good job.

411
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,367
Very exciting stuff.

412
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,970
Your wife keeps
her digits for now.

413
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:23,273
Let's see how you do on
round two, shall we?

414
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,610
There's a private school
a few miles north.

415
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:31,214
There's about to be
another shooting.

416
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:35,452
Get there and wait for
further instructions.

417
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,739
Please try to stay in the game.

418
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:58,141
I can't believe you're
a part of all this.

419
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,043
They didn't give me a choice.

420
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,345
Save it.

421
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,647
You're just a voice!

422
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,682
Tech support.

423
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,529
Okay, champ!

424
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,531
Good god, this guy is annoying.

425
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,434
There's a shooter
in the building.

426
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,004
The authorities are
about to be contacted.

427
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,440
Internal security will
attempt to take him out.

428
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,510
You are going to stop them.

429
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,513
- What?
- You heard it right, folks.

430
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:41,785
Your mission is to
protect the shooter.

431
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:47,257
And if you refuse, I've
been itching to spend some

432
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:51,194
time with Abbie.

433
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,565
Clock starts now.

434
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,602
I'm not doing this.

435
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,503
No.

436
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,038
Max, you have to.

437
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,205
No!

438
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,408
I don't wanna die.

439
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,523
I'm sorry.

440
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,145
Oh god.

441
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,195
Let me go!

442
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,496
Let me go!

443
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,166
They're gonna kill my mother!

444
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,839
You!

445
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,796
No, no, no, no!

446
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,272
Max.

447
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,512
Max! You have to get
him out of there.

448
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,367
Ladies and gentlemen,
we go now to frank b. Cooper

449
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,870
high school where a shooting
has just taken place.

450
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,439
Tragic day for our city.

451
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,376
You look sad, Orsy.

452
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,312
Why the blues?

453
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,781
You should be so happy.

454
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:00,417
Abbie's still in one piece.

455
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,352
Nothing?

456
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,721
No witty comeback?

457
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,490
That hurts my feelings.

458
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:11,228
Your next mission is a juicy...

459
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,601
Max, what are you doing?

460
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,971
Improvising.

461
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,982
Can you hear me?

462
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:37,254
This is your player.

463
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,724
I need your help.

464
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,403
Please eat.

465
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,878
I missed our lunches, Abbie.

466
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,916
You're as beautiful
now as you ever were.

467
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,489
Well...

468
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,324
Let's not quibble over details.

469
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,860
You were a snake then,
and you're a snake now.

470
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,529
Okay, well I'll take
that as a compliment.

471
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,300
A snake is an evolutionary
masterpiece and incredibly

472
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,701
misunderstood.

473
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:28,605
And like the snake, I'm just
doing what needs to be done.

474
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,976
Though I don't seem to
remember you putting up

475
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:38,682
such a fuss back when I
was paying your bills.

476
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,885
No one could type a
memo quite like you.

477
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,356
You ever tell creed about us?

478
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,825
There is no us,
you piece of shit.

479
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,428
Well...

480
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,096
Not for a while, right?

481
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,370
Churchill.

482
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:04,441
I keep Winston up there to
remind me to stay the course.

483
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:08,745
He once said, you have enemies?

484
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,380
Good.

485
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:15,385
That means you stood up for
something sometime in your life.

486
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:19,089
You can't expect everyone
to believe in your vision.

487
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,759
But when they wake up one
day in a better world,

488
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,929
they will thank you
for your contribution.

489
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,566
Yes.

490
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,465
That husband of yours
is a stubborn man.

491
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,567
You've underestimated him.

492
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,172
He's a survivor.

493
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,007
God, that's what
I love about you.

494
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,709
You're so dramatic.

495
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,944
You're just...
You're unpredictable.

496
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:20,116
I hate to eat and run, but uh...

497
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:25,922
Your husband is actually
becoming a bit of a nuisance.

498
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,693
And I need to go remind
the dog who's master.

499
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,006
I'll be back.

500
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:50,747
To build maybe the slow and
laborious tasks of years.

501
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:54,918
To destroy can be the
thoughtless act of a single day.

502
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,222
Churchill said that, too.

503
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,059
Careful of your dreams, Andrew.

504
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,878
Time to bring the pain.

505
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,113
Yo, yo, incoming, incoming!

506
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,048
We've got trees over here.

507
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,649
Watch out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

508
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,831
Get some, get some!

509
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,134
You don't want none
of this, creed.

510
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,870
You don't want
none of this, huh!

511
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,576
Get back here, creed!

512
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,721
Shit.

513
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,057
No, no, no!

514
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,230
Never thought you'd
betray us, creed.

515
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,134
Yes!

516
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,871
That's it.

517
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,288
You know what, creed...

518
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,161
Kincaid ordered not to shoot.

519
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:47,163
But I'm gonna shoot you anyway!

520
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,899
Yes!

521
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,670
Oh!

522
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,011
Wow.

523
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,116
What's up?

524
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,386
Right. You can't talk.

525
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:45,955
Hey, you there?

526
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:46,990
Me?

527
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,192
You said I can't mod this game.

528
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:50,860
Max.

529
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,095
But you can.

530
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,630
I can't.

531
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,231
Unblock the speech frequency.

532
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,766
Max, I...

533
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,035
Do it.

534
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:00,370
Or I'm done.

535
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,706
And so are you.

536
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,883
You okay?

537
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,890
Who the hell is that?

538
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,060
Tech support.

539
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,969
No.

540
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,405
Let them find the bugs.

541
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:38,141
Let them think that
they're ahead.

542
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:39,909
It won't matter.

543
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,449
I wanna see where he takes this.

544
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,353
How do you my house
is bugged, Mr. creed?

545
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,059
I created every security
protocol for sentinel

546
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,960
including bugging.

547
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,466
You bugged my house?

548
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:08,971
Everything you received from
sentinel is monitoring you.

549
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,743
Show me.

550
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,834
I need a beer.

551
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,471
Come on, join me.

552
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,778
Well drink up.

553
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,088
Oops, my bad!

554
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,359
We'll get that
cleaned up no problem.

555
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,131
So you're sentinel's
secret weapon?

556
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,467
Right here in the flesh.

557
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,505
Just a gamer.

558
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,845
So tell me...

559
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:28,551
What is all this that
you're doing, Mr. creed?

560
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:34,190
My wife calls me Mr.
Creed when she's upset.

561
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,959
We just met kid.

562
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:43,266
I develop a technology
that connects you to me.

563
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,268
It's called control x.

564
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:47,537
Control x?

565
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,206
Sounds like a
bad Sci-Fi movie.

566
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,109
It's the prototype.

567
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,845
It was meant for
surveillance, but I

568
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,247
thought it better
suited for military.

569
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,082
Why military?

570
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:02,151
I served a couple of tours.

571
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,987
Lost a few too many friends.

572
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:09,258
Control x is about making
stronger soldiers with

573
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,329
faster reflexes with
two sets of eyes.

574
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,066
And what's Kincaid got
to do with all this?

575
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:21,237
I'm not sure, but he
has some master plan.

576
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,872
Keeps guns in games.

577
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,340
No, that's bullshit.

578
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,408
I know Kincaid.

579
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,076
He's a one percenter.

580
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:30,012
He doesn't care how many lives
it takes to keep his billions.

581
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:35,418
I wanted control x to save
people, he wants it to use them.

582
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,153
So why'd you work for him?

583
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,522
He paid me good money.

584
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,891
Ah, yeah.

585
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,428
What about that Zane guy?

586
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,097
He's just a dog on a leash.

587
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,099
Brought in for muscle.

588
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:52,535
He's a glory seeker.

589
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,904
Wants everything I got.

590
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,074
Hang on a second.

591
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,575
Authorities have now
confirmed through

592
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:02,578
surveillance footage,
Orson creed has gone from

593
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,381
bank hero to murderer.

594
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,150
Strange and bizarre
day for our city.

595
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,419
An example of a man unhinged.

596
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,421
Truly shocking.

597
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:15,358
That's a load of shit.
Come on.

598
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,060
Just call me Oswald.

599
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,962
I'm the distraction.

600
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:21,497
From what?

601
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,499
The future of gaming.

602
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,469
What got you into it, kid?

603
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:36,145
Well um, it's just a
world that I fit in.

604
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:39,982
People in the real world
tend to let you down.

605
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,286
You lose someone who's
special in a game,

606
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:45,221
it doesn't hurt as bad.

607
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:51,928
Today actually marks two years
since I left this house.

608
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,697
Yeah.

609
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,205
I was uh...

610
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:07,610
I was coming from the gaming
tournament that I won and

611
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:11,514
being famous sometimes
makes you unpopular.

612
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:16,118
It was the middle of the
day, I was out walking

613
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,057
with my best friend...

614
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:27,296
And they drove by,
windows came down.

615
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:33,135
Let's just say that
they missed me.

616
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,605
Here's a picture.

617
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,575
Take a look.

618
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,020
What?

619
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,395
I loved that dog, okay?

620
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:05,568
Best thing that ever happened
to me before that day.

621
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,373
It's not always easy losing
someone you care about.

622
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,177
You should know that, right?

623
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,297
A signal.

624
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,135
You gotta get this
thing out of me, kid.

625
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:40,336
What the hell?

626
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,204
I don't know how to do that.

627
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,708
I do.

628
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,523
I'm gonna go flush
out this beer.

629
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,109
No.

630
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:54,443
Stand down.

631
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,179
I've got this.

632
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,529
I think you've had enough fun.

633
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,231
Why are you doing this?

634
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,398
Where is he?

635
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,367
Creed?

636
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:20,302
I'm here.

637
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,876
I'm disappointed in you, Max.

638
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:30,279
I chose you because
you're the best.

639
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:33,716
You understand the game world
and you understand rules.

640
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:37,186
Well you've broken the rules
so that means a penalty.

641
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:37,186
Tell me something.

642
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:40,489
How are you and your
girl doing, huh?

643
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:44,260
I'm sensing some
trust issues there.

644
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,295
I would kill it every
time, my friend.

645
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:51,267
I mean, what do we have if
we can't trust each other?

646
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,371
Princess, you okay?

647
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:59,375
She could be, but
that's up to you.

648
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,878
Here are five feeds of
five sentinel employees.

649
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,948
Each equally
disappointing to me.

650
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,583
You're naughty girl
is one of them.

651
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,617
Come on, that's bullshit.

652
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:09,785
You know I've seen her.

653
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,820
Pay attention, Max.

654
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,456
That's the point.

655
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,793
You choose wisely, she lives.

656
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:21,530
You choose poorly, they all die.

657
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,599
Tell you what.

658
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:25,935
I'm gonna make it easy on you.

659
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:30,706
Do it.

660
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:39,848
No.

661
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,518
You should be thanking me, Max.

662
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,221
Now you just got four choices.

663
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:46,855
You got sixty seconds.

664
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:47,990
Good luck.

665
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:49,225
Shit!

666
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,667
Max!

667
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,905
Max, what the hell is going on?

668
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,006
I don't know.

669
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:05,941
I don't know!

670
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,743
Shit.

671
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,020
There.

672
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,021
That's her.

673
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:19,755
It's her!

674
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:20,923
Feed 4.

675
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,024
Feed 4!

676
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,459
Come on, feed 4!

677
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:24,727
It's her!

678
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,643
Congratulations.

679
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,344
Why are you doing this?

680
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,446
What the hell do you want?

681
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,548
You'll be getting a
message with instructions.

682
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,753
And little man, I
suggest you follow them.

683
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:07,936
Baby, I'm okay.

684
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,842
They want you to go to the
ground floor of the needle.

685
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:21,517
Caleb Angelo will be
leaving a dinner and they

686
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,985
want you to kill him.

687
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:24,787
I love you.

688
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,538
I get it now.

689
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,939
Well tell me.

690
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:48,811
Caleb Angelo owns 51% of the
world's largest server file.

691
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,847
Kincaid only owns 40%.

692
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:55,718
With Angelo out of the way, he
can scoop up all of the shares.

693
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,619
Complete control.

694
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,522
He wants to play god.

695
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,094
Let's do this.

696
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:07,529
Alright, okay.

697
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,502
Creed.

698
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,972
Go get your wife back.

699
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,145
I'm sorry about your loss.

700
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,695
You know I'm coming after you.

701
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,664
Give you a good show.

702
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,810
Yeah, hi.

703
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:37,980
Can I get some popcorn, soda?

704
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,282
Thanks.

705
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:46,255
- Max.
- Hey!

706
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:47,756
Are you okay?

707
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:48,690
Shit.

708
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,725
I almost killed this dude.

709
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,993
- What!
- No, nevermind.

710
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,628
What happened?

711
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,696
They told me I was reassigned,
but I managed to sneak away.

712
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,198
I'm here to help how I can.

713
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,800
I'm so sorry that I
got you into this.

714
00:58:58,802 --> 00:58:59,835
Yeah, don't worry about it.

715
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:01,236
The important
thing is your safe.

716
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:02,704
What do you mean?

717
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,640
If I live through all
this, I'll tell you how I

718
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,642
saved your life like for real.

719
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:08,277
You can't tease
a girl like that.

720
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,245
Putting you on speaker.

721
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,850
I'm feeling adventurous.

722
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:17,286
Just remember, there's
no rebooting here.

723
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:18,921
If he dies, you're done.

724
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:21,590
Go big or go home, right?

725
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:22,824
I always wanted to do this.

726
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:25,694
Do what? I'm just
booting up my laptop.

727
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:26,728
This.

728
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,197
Yes!

729
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,233
Max, are you hanging from a car?

730
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,702
Why yes, your highness, I am.

731
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,771
You stay away from my dad.

732
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:36,939
Who the hell is this guy?

733
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:39,808
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

734
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,618
Hey!

735
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,000
Get him, boys!

736
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:07,235
Do what the hell I pay you for!

737
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,645
- Whoa!
- Dad!

738
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,953
Hey, look.
I am rich!

739
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,221
I'll pay you whatever
they're paying you and

740
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:27,956
I'll double it!

741
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,358
I'm not a bad guy.

742
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,093
I'll do anything for you.

743
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:32,294
I have a daughter.

744
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,296
She's beautiful, super hot.

745
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,330
You can have her.

746
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,765
I'll give her to you.

747
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:38,200
Just let me go.

748
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:40,102
Come on, guy, come on!

749
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:42,004
Max, are you...

750
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,839
Finishing the game.

751
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:47,142
Who the hell are you?

752
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,187
Hey! Fuck you!

753
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,665
Yeah. What the hell is
going on over there?

754
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,433
Angelo should've
recognized creed.

755
01:01:11,435 --> 01:01:14,936
Sir, he's here.

756
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:16,972
Lock it down.

757
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,708
Lock it down!

758
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,009
Yes, sir.

759
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,118
We're locked down, gentlemen.

760
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,720
No one out.

761
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:33,955
You know who's coming.

762
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:37,693
And remember no shooting.

763
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:39,695
So unstrap.

764
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,433
Now.

765
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:56,211
Kincaid wants him alive
and wait for my command.

766
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,281
Creed.

767
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:41,523
What makes you think you
can just walk back in here?

768
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,024
Where's Abbie?

769
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,030
Come to rescue your girl?

770
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:55,003
I heard she had a lovely
meal with her boss.

771
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:08,784
They might even be getting
ready to call it a night.

772
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:12,020
I'm not leaving
here without her.

773
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,426
You hear that?

774
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,031
He's not leaving without her.

775
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,045
Fuck you.

776
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:45,854
I've retired from violence.

777
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:55,197
Guess we're gonna call
this a cheat day.

778
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,003
Tear that bitch's
arms and legs off.

779
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,591
Creed!

780
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,035
All personal.
Report to main entrance.

781
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:17,612
Let's go!

782
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,147
Come on, creed!

783
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,183
- Get up!
- You ain't nothing!

784
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,361
Stop!

785
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,012
- Come on, creed!
- Get up!

786
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,098
Dead man.

787
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,652
Creed!

788
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,324
Oh, no!

789
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,231
Get up!

790
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,599
This isn't over.

791
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,705
I gave you a chance.

792
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:31,840
What?

793
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:40,381
I gave you a chance.

794
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,438
We were like brothers.

795
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,482
Abbie!

796
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,318
Stop.

797
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,819
Right there.

798
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,458
She'll be dead before
you can touch her.

799
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,694
So...

800
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,897
Where's Zane?

801
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,365
He's dead.

802
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,801
Congratulations.

803
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,670
Well maybe you're next.

804
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,274
Maybe.

805
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:49,544
Is this what this
all comes down to?

806
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,749
Well, I hope you've rehearsed.

807
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,652
That's cute.

808
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:03,024
And for your information,
yes, I have.

809
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:07,528
I gotta say you were uh,
fairly impressive, but I mean,

810
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,965
what else would we expect
from the great Orson creed?

811
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,734
Am I right?

812
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:17,805
Well I had some help, but
you know all about that.

813
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,474
Yes, you did.

814
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,378
Which reminds me,
where is Robin?

815
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,380
Oh yeah.

816
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,653
In my evil trap.

817
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,389
So...

818
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:40,461
Onto the monologue, yeah?

819
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:45,033
What was it you wanted
to know, my master plan?

820
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,637
Well it's your game, maestro.

821
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,838
Always a gentlemen.

822
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,907
Even under duress.

823
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,544
But why kids?

824
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:58,346
Why would you kill children?

825
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:02,016
They're causalities of war.

826
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,353
You're delusional.

827
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,490
I'm delusional?

828
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:18,666
It's broken, creed.

829
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:22,370
The whole damn show is broken.

830
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:24,872
And you wanna take control x
and you wanna give it to the

831
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:28,910
puppeteers, the people who
sell you, sell all of us

832
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:31,913
on America, land of the free.

833
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:35,817
You wanna do that and
you call me delusional?

834
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,588
I see the future.

835
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:47,395
In the gamers lies
our salvation.

836
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:52,667
As events like today
continue, the country will

837
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:55,036
pass my bill willingly.

838
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,410
To keep guns in games.

839
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:07,548
An army of elite gamers.

840
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,985
Born through with
what we provide.

841
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:15,890
An absolute controlled
militia ready to strike.

842
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:20,828
That, that is the
revolution of today.

843
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:29,470
And that's how we show the world
the potential in our humanity.

844
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,876
From time to time, the
tree of Liberty must be

845
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:40,548
refreshed with the
blood of patriots.

846
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:14,982
This is our wasteland
and what we've made

847
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,185
doesn't have to be like this.

848
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:24,992
Sometimes to make things
better you need to start

849
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,094
by making them worse.

850
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,598
And I will do that.

851
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,835
I will tear it down.

852
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,805
I will tear it all down.

853
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:46,481
And then I will rebuild
it brick by brick.

854
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:50,785
So you'll lead this new order?

855
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,659
And you could've been
there, right at my side.

856
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,865
That's bullshit.

857
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,902
You don't have the right
to control people from

858
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,771
being assholes and you can't
because we're gonna fuck up.

859
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:12,807
That's what being human is.

860
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:15,776
This was never about
saving the wasteland.

861
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:18,112
The wasteland is
inevitable because of who

862
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:22,183
we are and that's
reality brother.

863
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:25,686
So who's selling who?

864
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,556
This is about you
and no one else.

865
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:31,259
This is about your greed,
this is about your quest

866
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:33,661
to be what only a god can be.

867
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:36,764
Right now I am god.

868
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,136
Well you can't control me.

869
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:45,806
You sure as hell
can't control her.

870
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:51,312
At the end of it all,
what is this really?

871
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:57,051
It's about what you don't have,
what you can't have...

872
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,020
What I have.

873
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,822
You don't know shit.

874
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:13,067
You don't think I
saw you coveting her?

875
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:16,637
Well no matter what
happens today,

876
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:22,276
you'll always know that
she chose me over you.

877
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:24,712
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

878
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:26,147
What are you doing?

879
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,118
Hey!

880
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,254
Drop the controller.

881
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:37,625
Drop it.

882
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:39,627
Drop it right now!

883
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:41,929
Hey!

884
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,699
Drop the controller now!

885
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,167
No!

886
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,337
Shit.

887
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:50,204
Shit.

888
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,305
Gotcha.

889
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,648
Abbie!

890
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,272
Come on! Come on! Come on!

891
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,341
Shit!

892
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:29,810
Max, what is it?
What's going on?

893
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,980
Max!

894
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:47,662
When I come back, you'll
buy me dinner to thank me.

895
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:48,829
What?

896
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,097
Max, wait!

897
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:51,932
Max!

898
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,782
This ends now.

899
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,503
I'll remember you well.

900
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,376
Kincaid!

901
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,481
Remember why your
friend is dead, Max.

902
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,052
Because of what you're
holding in your hand.

903
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:30,424
Through me, that'll
never happen again.

904
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:32,092
Shoot him.

905
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,531
I know you won't shoot me.

906
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,567
Let's go home.

907
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:26,213
You're going to our house.

908
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,514
Let's not make a date of it.

909
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:29,083
Come on, let's go.

910
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:42,029
So if you're just joining us,
I'm here with Max Troy.

911
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,266
Champion gamer and former
lead tester for sentinel.

912
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:48,269
After a very bizarre chain
of events that one might

913
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:51,238
only find in a video
game, the sentinel board

914
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,943
unanimously voted in this
young man and their new ceo.

915
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:57,611
You've been fairly silent
since this has all

916
01:21:57,613 --> 01:22:00,581
happened and we're
all dying to know.

917
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,183
Tell us a little bit about
what happened and what you

918
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:04,451
have planned.

919
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:07,488
Well one thing we must
acknowledge as a leader in

920
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:11,959
this field is our responsibility
to shape our society.

921
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:15,129
If you look where we've
come, or arguably where

922
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:17,264
we've fallen to, you have
to ask yourself what

923
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,701
happened to our humanity
and where did it go?

924
01:22:20,703 --> 01:22:24,672
In my new position, my
focus is to return the

925
01:22:24,674 --> 01:22:26,607
spotlight to the gamers.

926
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:29,576
I find that the single
most important thing.

927
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:31,178
And hopefully if we're
smart enough, we can

928
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:35,549
remind our consumers to
engage in balance, to

929
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:39,386
remember what makes them
human in the first place.

930
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,388
In between missions of course.

931
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,225
Some of your critics
have voiced concerns.

932
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,594
Going as far as to fear
you're gonna fall into the

933
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,663
same track as your predecessor.

934
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:52,266
And with such an
unprecedented vote,

935
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:55,636
some are wondering, I think,
if you almost planned

936
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:57,338
for this to happen.

937
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:00,341
Any ambitious man would
dream of reaching the top.

938
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:03,744
To deny that would deny
my own humanity I think.

939
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:07,681
Andrew Kincaid was a god
in his world and any god

940
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:11,618
who is obsessed with his
own power sets himself up

941
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,721
for his own demise.

942
01:23:13,723 --> 01:23:17,758
And that power
falls on his angels.

943
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,161
Someone had to take
up the reigns.

944
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:25,733
All we can do is hope
for a fresh perspective.

945
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:29,670
Ultimately it's up to us
to enter this world,

946
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:34,308
to take up that controller,
to make those decisions.

947
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,644
Ultimately, it's your quarter.

948
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,481
So there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

949
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:42,583
Straight from the man himself.

950
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:46,653
Time will tell if sentinel
takes us in a new direction.

951
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,224
We will all be
curiously watching.
