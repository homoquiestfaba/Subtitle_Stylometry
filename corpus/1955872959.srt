It's... it's a form of gold.

180
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,543
It kind of looks
like Molly.

181
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:32,042
Well, I assure you,
it's not.

182
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:35,668
And the positive effects
last much longer.

183
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:36,835
Oh!

184
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,084
Oh, thank you.
What's this?
Boing.

185
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,626
Deejaying
a wicked gig tonight.

186
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,292
So, if you wanna
come 'round,

187
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,126
I'll put you on the list.

188
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,376
That's very nice of you.

189
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:48,876
And thank you for the gold.
(phone chiming)

190
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,626
Of course.
Hold on, let me take this.

191
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:51,876
Yeah.
Hey!

192
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,251
What's going on, Raina?

193
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,084
Raina (on phone):
Nothing, I'm sorry
to call you.

194
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,209
I know that you prefer texts.

195
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,167
The Guy (on phone):
No, it's fine.

196
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,334
You home?
I am!

197
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,584
Cool. Be like
an hour or so?

198
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,501
Okay, thank you.
That's perfect.

199
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,501
Cool. I love you.

200
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,334
Oh. (laughs)
Um, thank you.

201
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:12,209
Bye.

202
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,459
Damn it.

203
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,501
Daria:
Do you want me to BCC
Bebe and Cece Winans?

204
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,710
Jo:
Of course!

205
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,543
But then BCC Bebe Neuwirth.

206
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,543
But Cece Peniston told me
to CC Bebe...
(phone chimes)

207
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:27,459
...not BCC Bebe,
'cause she cannot be trusted.

208
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,126
Okay, that could work.
Jo: Okay.

209
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,668
Jo:
Have you guys
seen my blue wig?

210
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,167
Oh, Kayla has your blue wig.

211
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,084
You lent it to her
at Ars Nova.

212
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,543
Jo:
Oh, fuck, you're right.

213
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,751
(knocking at door)
Daria: You're not
gonna get it back.

214
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,918
Oh... (whispers)
Who is that?

215
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,209
Is it your neighbor?
Jo: I'll get it.

216
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,251
The Guy: Hey!
Oh, hey.

217
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,167
(whispers)
Weed.

218
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,418
Jo: Come in.
The Guy: How are ya?

219
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:52,084
Hi!
Daria: Hi!

220
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,918
I'm so sorry about that...

221
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:56,710
"I love you"
moment on the phone.

222
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,084
It was so weird.
Raina: Oh!

223
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,084
Don't worry about it.
I had a hard week,

224
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,793
so it was actually sort of nice
to have some positive energy.

225
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:05,292
I said "I love you"
to my therapist.

226
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,459
That happens.

227
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,459
Um, wait. How did you get
in the building, though?

228
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,459
Uh, the neighbor
downstairs let me in.

229
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,918
Oh, yeah.

230
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:14,584
Stuff like that happens
all the time, you know?

231
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,126
People just slip in
behind someone,

232
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:19,626
and then...
the worst happens.

233
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,876
Yeah. Looks like you guys
are doing something...

234
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,835
something.
We got a show.

235
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,543
The Guy: Oh, yeah?
Daria: Yeah.

236
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,001
You want to come?

237
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,126
Lots of invitations today.

238
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,960
Oh, wow. I didn't know
you all performed together.

239
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,126
I'm actually gonna
sit this one out.

240
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,960
I don't feel up to it, so...

241
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,876
Yeah, I don't really
feel like going there,

242
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,626
and being like,
"You ever been on Tinder?"

243
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,543
You know, it just,
like, isn't real.
Raina, come on.

244
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:46,084
You know how much I promoted
this on social media.

245
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:49,501
I do know, but...
I got blocked
by my mom.

246
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,459
Well, I'm not surprised,
but I can't do it.

247
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,042
So, I don't want to.
Jo: I'll stay with you.

248
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,626
And... stand by you.
What?!

249
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,459
Jo!
I know the plan.

250
00:11:58,459 --> 00:11:59,876
You're gonna go.
I'm gonna stay.

251
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,167
I don't know if I'm gonna go.

252
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,584
I'm not committing.
Raina: It's fine.

253
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,167
I'm just gonna sit back,

254
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,793
and if you call,
and I don't answer,

255
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,292
just know that I went painfully.

256
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,543
It was hard.
It was a tough death.

257
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:11,084
Jo: Not funny.
All right.

258
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:13,751
This is what they want.
They want you to be
scared in your home.

259
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,209
The Guy: "They"?
Daria: You have to come.

260
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,418
The Guy:
I don't want to interrupt,

261
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:18,835
but is anyone gonna
actually buy weed?

262
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,167
(beeping)

263
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,209
(clears throat)

264
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,042
Hey, everyone.

265
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,459
It's Raina Noriega.

266
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,501
Your girl made a mistake.

267
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,084
(whispers)
Fuck.

268
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,334
(beeps)

269
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,251
Hey, Internet,
it's Raina Noriega.

270
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:42,126
You might not know me.
I'm not shocked if you don't.

271
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,876
Small career.

272
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:47,001
I made a huge mistake earlier.

273
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,918
(beeps)

274
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:51,418
Hi, this is Raina Noriega.

275
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:53,876
I wanted to apologize.

276
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,334
I'm very sorry for a tweet
that I had sent earlier.

277
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,793
Um, I want to apologize
to my family,

278
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,710
and my friends
who've been affected,

279
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,042
and to everyone that I hurt,
'cause I'm realizing now
I hurt a lot of people,

280
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,626
and that was never my intention.

281
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:11,710
You know, I have less
than 20,000 followers.

282
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,376
I didn't think
it would get around.

283
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:18,084

murdering the president...

Kind of. I was...

297
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,793
I was dancing one night,
and I thought...

298
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:01,251
No, no, no, I didn't
actually think at all.

299
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:04,459
I felt, "This is
fucking freedom."

300
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,042
And how fucking awesome
is the human body?

301
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:10,084
I mean, we actually have
no idea what it can do.

302
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:12,960
So I figured, why not see
how long I can go?

303
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,793
Yeah.
Why do we do
anything, you know?

304
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:16,793
The woman who currently
holds the record

305
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,626
was hospitalized
on her first attempt.

306
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,710
Are you not worried?
Oh, yeah,
she got all dehydrated.

307
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,459
So, I'm way ahead of that.

308
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,501

00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:48,876
Yeah, this subway tile's
really nice, man.

529
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:50,710
You guys did such a good job.

530
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,167
Dan:
Thank you!

531
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,584
It's coming along.

532
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,459
And you're going to Iceland
next week, man?

533
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,167
I've always wanted
to go to Iceland.

534
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,543
Yeah!
When are you leaving?

535
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:00,376
Next Wednesday.
I'm fucking excited!

536
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:02,543
Oh, I bet.
It's honestly the most
beautiful place on Earth.

537
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,251
Yeah, what are you gonna do
when you get there?

538
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,876
Oh, well, I got the
whole thing planned out.

539
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,543
We're going to Reykjavík,

540
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,376
and we're gonna
land there first.

541
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:14,167
Uh-huh.
I got one of those
Mercedes Sprinter RVs.

542
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:17,001
And we're gonna camp
all the way around
the countryside.

543
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,668
Oh. On that Ring Road?
Just camping out.

544
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:19,835
Exactly!
That is...

545
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,626
We're bringing our bikes.
It's gonna be sick!

546
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,793
Hello, hello!
Oh, hey, man!
Hey!

547
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:25,376
What's up?
Oh, not much.

548
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,751
You know,
a slave to the job.

549
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:28,084
Oh, I get it.

550
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:29,501
It's what vacations
are for, right?

551
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,418
I know, and you're
going to Iceland. Say hi...

552
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:32,751
(screams)

553
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:34,126
Iceland?!

554
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:36,626
Oh, I fucking knew it!
(phone chiming)

555
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:39,084
Iceland!
Damn, you motherfucker,
done ruined the surprise!

556
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:41,501
I knew it!
Dude, it was my second guess!

557
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,960
Motherfucker!
Just...
(squeals)

558
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,376
Hey Jim, what's up, man?

559
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,710
Jim (on phone):
Hey, you around?
My lady friend needs some help.

560
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,584
Yeah, happy to help.

561
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:51,751
(kiss)
(playful growling)

562
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,918
(instrumental music playing)

563
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,251
Hello?

564
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,001
Hello?

565
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:09,126
Hello?

566
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,501
Oh, hey, Gloria!

567
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:13,626
(moans)

568
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:14,751

00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,501

570
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:20,292
Oh, Jesus.
You okay?

571
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:23,626
I'm dancing.
Yeah, he said you're doing
a dance marathon.

572
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:25,793
Oh, hi.

573
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:31,292
Oh, wow.

574
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,626
You're gonna dance
for a whole nother day?

575
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:36,584
Well, that's what they say.

576
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:39,876
Well, Jim asked me
to get you a little something.

577
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:42,584
No, Jimmy...
To help you out here.

578
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,376
Maybe this'll help.

579
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:47,334
Do you want me
to light it for you?
Oh.

580
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,918
Sucio.

581
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,459
Sucio?
Mmm.

582
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,543
I'll dance with you.

583
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:57,668
You're sweet.

584
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:00,376
Here you go.
Everybody left.

585
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:02,167
Everyone left?
Mmm.

586
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:05,459
Yeah, I imagine
it's probably pretty hard
to do this without people here.

587
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:07,167
It's not child's play.

588
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,876
No.

589
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:12,501
Pretty good, huh?

590
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,292
This is Amnesia Haze.

591
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,960
Oh!

592
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,001
You know, it's like, uh...

593
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:21,918
Mm, I'm not afraid
of death, you know?

594
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,459
(chuckles)
What?

595
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:24,835
Never have been.

596
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,334
(laughing)

597
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,876
Mm-mm.

598
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:34,626
Oh. Still dancing.

599
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,209
Mm-hmm.
Still dancing.

600
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:40,668
Before you came,
I was really thirsty.

601
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:45,167
And I was thinking about
the caves of Lascaux.

602
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:48,042
Lascaux?
You know 'em?

603
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,960
In France,

604
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,501
where the Neanderthals
and Homo sapiens

605
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,710
gathered together
at the same time,

606
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,751
there was overlapping.

607
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,501
And...

608
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,418
the ones who made
the art won.

609
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:06,418
That's what they saw

610
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,584
in the layers
of the caves at Lat...

611
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:10,960
No, Germany,
not Lascaux.

612
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,626
And they...

613
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:16,418
sang.
