1
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,313
New algorithm should increase uptime
by at least to 20% .

2
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,586
Let's hope that's enough.
We need to catch a break here.

3
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,193
Today's the day, sir. l can feel it.
All systems are go.

4
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,394
Excellent.

5
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,802
Proceed to Phase Two.

6
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,484
lnitiating dispersal protocol now.

7
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,031
Releasing the drones.

8
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,743
They're in the air.
First databurst coming in three... two...

9
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,320
. . .one.

10
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,718
Piping the datastreams
into Little Blue.

11
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,587
Starting the predictive model.

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,222
All right, she's all yours.

13
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,358
All right, we are live.

14
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,898
How's it looking on your end, Major?

15
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:24,634
Looks good.

16
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,712
Transmission is clean.

17
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,907
Statistical accuracy at 42%

18
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,240
44...

19
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,183
Now 48 percent.

20
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,345
Looks like we have a constant
rising target, Major.

21
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,716
Tracking.

22
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,151
Do you see it?

23
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,558
About 3,000 meters, about 10:00.
18 degrees east.

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,325
52% .

25
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,360
Let's switch it over.

26
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,763
Hold on.

27
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,301
Now at 55% .

28
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,201
Drones are down 30% .

29
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,247
We'll start to get a drop in data
transmission in 30 seconds.

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,807
Just hold on.

31
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,312
57% .
Stabilizing at target levels, Major.

32
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,319
We're running out of time.
Let's do this, people.

33
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,921
Yes.
Switching to lateral controls now.

34
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,369
We have acceleration, Major.

35
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,235
We're measuring
a wind-speed increase of 1 1 % , sir.

36
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,243
1 1 % . Outstanding.

37
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,608
Let's fly this plane.

38
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,183
Affirmative.
Ready to proceed to the next phase.

39
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,520
Acceleration is increasing.

40
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,818
Velocity up 18%

41
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,317
18% ?

42
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,019
That's significantly higher than the model.
Do we have a problem, Doctor?

43
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,458
Cannot confirm at this time, Major.

44
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,031
We're now at 23% .

45
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,068
Ground speed 735 miles per hour.

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,746
You're exceeding the structural
limitations of the plane.

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,542
Shut it down.

48
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,921
Negative response.

49
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,353
We're still accelerating.

50
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,558
- Danger! Danger!
- lntegrity of the jet stream is compromised.

51
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,197
- Danger! Danger! Danger!
- lt's diving. Get back to your seats.

52
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,259
- Danger! Danger! Danger!
- Lock in!

53
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,798
Danger! Danger! Danger!

54
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,837
Break out of the stream.
lnitiate shut-down protocols now.

55
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,677
We need more power to break out of this.
Maxed out on throttle.

56
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,923
Danger! Danger! Danger!

57
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,026
Lost contact, sir.
l need the abort code.

58
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,067
Hang on. Let's see
if they can break out of this.

59
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,397
The jet stream's been diverted.

60
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,898
- Diverted where?
- West coast, sir.

61
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,466
Just north of San Francisco.

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,475
Abort code Tango-Delta.

63
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,041
Transmitting.

64
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,123
Surf's up in California.

65
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,961
No, actually, l am a scientist.
l was going to be a scientist.

66
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,697
l was going to go further with that,
but now here l am, l'm a weatherman.

67
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,604
Okay, more energy, more energy.

68
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,468
l'm Steve ''Sunny'' Simpson.

69
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,313
When you're looking for the guy
that knows Seattle's weather,

70
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,943
l'm the weather. . .

71
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,943
lt's Angel.

72
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,822
This is forward, right?
Okay, let's try it again.

73
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,185
But this thing's not knocking
on our door yet.

74
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,159
lt's way out in the scab lands.

75
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,592
Does-does anybody even know
where the scab lands are?

76
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,862
Are they east? West?

77
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,357
Oh, they're east, okay.

78
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,324
Um... going again?

79
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,895
What? We're live?

80
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,707
Normal high in the Seattle
area this year...

81
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,111
So, it looks like another Steve
''Sunny'' Simpson week.

82
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,487
Kilometers? Are we...

83
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,524
...are we doing the Canadian version
or the American version?

84
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,125
Here we go.

85
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:42,065
Have winds gusting up into 60 kilometers
per hour just about midnight.

86
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,359
On the way.
We'll talk about that in the Mormon.

87
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,005
ln the moment.
ln a moment! ln a moment!

88
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,909
Good morning, Seattle. Take a deep breath.
The air is fresh and clean,

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,339
thanks to the freak thunderstorms that
have been hitting us all week.

90
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,345
The weather guy swears to me
we've got nothing but blue sky ahead of us.

91
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,680
That doesn't go for the Seattle
Thunderbirds, of course.

92
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,312
They're 0 and 1 4 and looking
for a way into the record books.

93
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,921
lf you ask me we can do it.
Let's see if we can't make this...

94
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,727
There you go.
Just sent you my analysis.

95
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,556
Excellent.
We look forward to reviewing it.

96
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,434
Okay, so listen, Mr. or Ms. Anonymous
whoever you are,

97
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,899
this armchair analyst thing you have
me doing here, it's falling short.

98
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,067
We really need
some on-the-ground observations.

99
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,639
What are you proposing?

100
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,014
Well, it looks to me like one of these
anomalies is forming kind of close to here.

101
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,175
How can you tell?

102
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,912
l don't know, l can just... tell.
Call it a hunch.

103
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,917
Anyway, here's an idea.
How about we go out there together,

104
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,326
we make some observations,
and we finally meet?

105
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,191
- That's not recommended.
- Hey, honey?

106
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,362
What do you mean, ''not recommended?''
There's no substitute for direct observation.

107
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,235
Plus, l think l deserve to know
who l've been dealing with.

108
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,104
We strongly advise
you stay clear of that area.

109
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,832
- Honey?
- Why? What's the issue?

110
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,367
Why won't you just. . .

111
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,269
Oh, my. . .

112
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,612
Hello? Over here? Your fiance?

113
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,342
Oh, l'm sorry, baby. Come here.
Here, come here.

114
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,786
Come here.

115
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,055
Who were you just talking to?

116
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,790
l wish l knew.
lt's this same anonymous caller.

117
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,352
They keep feeding me data
and asking me questions.

118
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,791
Really?
You expect me to believe that?

119
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,199
Why would they be feeding you data?

120
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,661
l don't know, l guess they,
um, value my input.

121
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,701
And who might they be?

122
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,033
Like l keep telling you, baby,
l have no idea.

123
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,798
lt's probably some climate research team
that's stuck and they need some insight.

124
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,237
From you? A research team?

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,241
- What do you mean, ''from me?''
- Nothing.

126
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,509
Oh...

127
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,109
you mean from a guy who got kicked out
of his doctoral program for plagiarism.

128
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,289
Okay, l didn't say that
so stop being so sensitive.

129
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,554
Okay.

130
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,757
Besides, l thought they called it cheating.

131
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,423
Yeah, same thing.
l get it okay.

132
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,526
Okay plagiarism.

133
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,660
Okay, stop.

134
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,231
Look. . . you know l'll stand by
you no matter what. . .

135
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,197
. . .but you just, you've got
a great opportunity here.

136
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,169
As the KPQR weatherman?

137
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,267
Yeah.

138
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,700
Steve, you've got to
let go of the past,

139
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,237
okay? You've got a new job ahead of you
and rocking the boat like this is risky.

140
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,209
l'm not rocking the boat.

141
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,649
l've been tracking these weird
patterns for months now.

142
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,351
My predictive algorithms show
that they're going to spike.

143
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,120
l just... l wish you could forget all this
and focus on your job.

144
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,194
- My job is to predict the weather, Ange!
- No, that is a scientist's job!

145
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,591
And that didn't pan out,
which, you know, is fine by me.

146
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,233
But your job is to. . .

147
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,868
you know, deliver your lines, and look cute,
and be funny, and you're great at that.

148
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,637
- Jack knows it, too. He's grooming you. . .
- Jack, please.

149
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,244
- Speak of the devil.
- Please, think about it. For me.

150
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,911
l have. This is Steve!

151
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,883
Steve? Come on, buddy,
where's the nickname we worked out?

152
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,192
Steve ''Sunny'' Simpson, weather guy.
Friendly, easy on the eye.

153
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,119
Right? With me?

154
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,524
Sunny. Sunny Simpson.
Yeah, sure. You know,

155
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,193
- we don't want to alienate the average Joe.
- Alienate? God forbid!

156
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,364
We are entertainers, sonny boy.
Hold on a sec.

157
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,304
What the hell is this?
Get him in here.

158
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,704
That's what l love about this job.

159
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,540
Entertainment opens up opportunities
to inspire,

160
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,080
to educate to make a difference
in the world.

161
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,276
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell are you talking about?

162
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,849
This is about ratings.

163
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,756
l don't know what difference
you're planning on making,

164
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,388
but this is all about ratings.

165
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,425
So let's see
if we can't give them a boost huh?

166
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,061
Lighten up,
bring some levity to the game.

167
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,757
My bottom line goes down when their
bottom line goes down, you got that?

168
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,801
- Uh...
- Go, go, go!

169
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,165
Gee, l can do that, Jack, you know.
l can l can do some light banter, and,

170
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,206
you know, we can have a little
more fun with it. That's cool.

171
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,741
Maybe try some where
you wear different outfits, you know?

172
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,678
Like reflecting the weather.

173
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,845
So if it's snow, like, wear a big coat.

174
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,379
lf it's rain, maybe a rain hat.

175
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,947
- lf it's a sunny day...
- What?

176
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,350
...maybe a colored shirt.

177
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,120
Wow, Jack, you know what, man?
That's really original.

178
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,254
Let's try injecting some sex appeal.
How about a speedo?

179
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,231
A speedo?

180
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,994
Are you serious?

181
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,701
Serious as a heart attack.

182
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,398
Yeah, you know what, Jack, um,
l don't think that's going to play too well.

183
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,206
Aw, come on, Sunny,
get with the program.

184
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,211
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hold on.

185
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,646
l got another brainstorm.

186
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,045
Weatherman gone wild.

187
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,981
Weatherman gone wild?

188
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:35,217
Yeah, you know, like ''Girls Gone Wild,''
Teens Gone Wild? Weatherman Gone Wild.

189
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,592
Weather's gone crazy,
so has the weatherman.

190
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:42,195
Weatherman Gone Wild! Think about it.
lt's got YouTube virality written all over it.

191
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,197
Weatherman Gone Wild!

192
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,463
l want you to think about it Come on,
say it back to me, Steve. Say it back to me.

193
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,640
- Smile!
- Weatherman Gone Wild.

194
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,201
There you go. Say it again.

195
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,710
You know what this is really interesting,
but l got something l've got to talk to you about.

196
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,640
Just say it back to me, come on.
Weatherman Gone Wild.

197
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,449
Weatherman Gone Wild, okay?
l'm gonna think about it, but listen. . .

198
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,519
. . .l've got this huge scoop.
lt's an unbelievable story.

199
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,287
What like a weather scoop?

200
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,720
Yeah. All l need is a camera crew
and a field truck.

201
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,419
Who do you think you are?
Tom Brokaw?

202
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,831
l'll give you a van and a cameraman.
What are you going to give me, weatherman?

203
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,467
Jack l am going to give you footage
you have never seen before.

204
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,801
That's what l love about you,
sonny boy, you get it.

205
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,043
What are we talking about here?
Give me the pitch.

206
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,471
Okay, check it out, Jack.

207
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,478
There is going to be a convergence
in the jet stream that's going to cause this...

208
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,579
...huge weather anomaly.
lt's going to be out of this world.

209
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,351
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell are
you talking about?

210
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,753
Um...

211
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,559
l'm talking about, uh, l'm talking about
Weatherman Gone Wild!

212
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,058
- Yeah.
- lt's gonna be off the charts.

213
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,724
- Richter. Weatherman Gone Wild, l'm all in.
- Now you're talking.

214
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,433
Save all the cerebral nonsense
for the Discovery Channel.

215
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,296
l want ratings.
l want Weatherman Gone Wild!

216
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,705
Yeah, l hear you, brother. Okay, cool.
Weatherman Gone Wild, l got it.

217
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,044
Over and out.

218
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,247
That guy is out of his mind.

219
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,517
Promise me something?

220
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,582
Sure, anything, baby.

221
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,816
No more anonymous calls, okay?
Just it doesn't feel right that.

222
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,586
- l have no idea who's calling me!
- Okay. . . whatever.

223
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,223
Just no more, all right?

224
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,327
Okay.

225
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,061
- l love you.
- Love you.

226
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,163
- Weatherman gone wild.
- Whoo! Yeah, baby.

227
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,432
- The new Weatherman Gone Wild.
- Bye.

228
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,540
You better look out
when you get home tonight.

229
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,145
Bye!

230
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,151
No signal.

231
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,464
So how'd you get
into this racket anyway, Louie?

232
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,507
News cameraman.
How did you get into it?

233
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,434
Did you always want
to be a cameraman?

234
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,338
Did you play with the cameras as a kid?
You know, stuff like that?

235
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,712
You gotta pay the bills.

236
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,117
Keeps the ball and chain happy.

237
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,679
Right. You mean the wife.

238
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,716
The wife.

239
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,628
lt's happening.

240
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,771
- lt's gonna be. . .
- You know, l was born in Budapest, Hungary.

241
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,998
Went to the same film school
with Vilmos Zsigmond.

242
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,340
Wilmore Zigmund?

243
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,014
Vilmos Zsigmond,
the great cinematographer.

244
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,974
He shot movies for Steven Spielberg.

245
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,341
Spielberg? Really?

246
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,844
Yeah, and l shoot
the KPQR Morning News.

247
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,483
l hear you, man. Life's a bitch, huh?

248
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,325
And then you die.

249
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,587
- Yeah.
- Are you sure there's a story here?

250
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,960
- Not much to look at.
- Louie,

251
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,568
see those cirrocumulus clouds
right there?

252
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,204
That's what l want you to focus on.

253
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,505
Well, l thought it was something
more to do with Weatherman Gone Wild.

254
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,940
l'm not sure Jack
was thinking about this.

255
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,242
l don't care what Jack's thinking about.
This is a huge scoop, Louie.

256
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,545
The jet stream's not supposed to change.
lt's a constant.

257
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,347
lt's like gravity got shut off
in the middle of the night.

258
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,493
So no girls in bikinis, huh?

259
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,022
Just roll the camera.
The clouds are perfect right now.

260
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,195
Ah, perfect, you say.

261
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,064
- Nobody's ever seen anything like this.
- Okay.

262
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,230
How about you just indulge me
a little bit?

263
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,368
l'll indulge you all you want,
just don't forget that

264
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,437
this is supposed to be a live broadcast.

265
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,077
Live?

266
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,914
Yeah. They wanted us to do it live.

267
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,941
l thought we were just getting
some B-roll.

268
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,083
Now...

269
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,583
. . .are you ready with your. . .

270
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,756
. . .your stand-up
Weatherman Gone Wild?

271
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,161
lt's a story about climate change,
the jet stream changing course.

272
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,331
l don't want to rain
on your parade, but...

273
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,266
- this is not PBS.
- Yeah, l hear you.

274
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,269
- Now, Steve, just relax.
- Okay.

275
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,002
Play on the fact that you're on a live shoot
and nothing's happening.

276
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,308
Trust me, this won't be first time.

277
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,578
Really? Thanks, Louie.

278
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,280
No problem, kid.

279
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,910
You going to stand there?

280
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,713
Yeah.
Just don't forget to pan up to the sky.

281
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,192
Yeah, got it. Here we go.

282
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,491
Five. . .

283
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,893
Four...

284
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,362
Three. . .

285
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,659
Boy, l wouldn't want to be
in their shoes!

286
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,828
Speaking of hot and wild,

287
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,872
here's our own Steve Sunny Simpson,

288
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,007
the Weatherman Gone Wild
with an incredible story.

289
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,334
Sunny, what do you have for us?

290
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,441
How's it going back there?

291
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,380
Fine, Steve, the question is,
how's it going there?

292
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:32,274
Right!

293
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,645
Well, what if l told you that,
in the middle of the night,

294
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,447
- gravity got shut off?
- What?

295
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,089
That's exactly what l said.
l want you to take a look at this.

296
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,192
That's a classic cirrocumulus cloud.

297
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,324
They exist between 25,000
to 40,000 feet in the jet stream.

298
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,232
But notice how it's shredded?

299
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,558
- What l'm saying is that the jet stream as...
- What the hell kind of scoop is this?

300
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,729
we have known it
has changed fundamentally.

301
00:17:56,508 --> 00:18:00,638
That's fascinating, Sunny.
So what are we looking at in our future?

302
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,277
l mean, in terms of weather.

303
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,145
lt's kind of hard to tell from here, but...

304
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,983
What is that?

305
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,761
What do you expect us
to tell the President, Major?

306
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,433
- Have you lost control of Thor's Hammer?
- Lost control?

307
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,710
What you're looking
at is proof of concept.

308
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,542
Thor's Hammer is going to be one of the
most powerful weapons systems ever created.

309
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,985
This is not going to get developed
without some degree of collateral damage.

310
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:49,691
l'm not exactly sure
what your expectations are.

311
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,033
We expect the collateral damage
to remain below acceptable levels.

312
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,037
You give me the eggs,
l'll make the omelette.

313
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,109
Proceed, Major.

314
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,308
Yes, ma'am.
Wouldn't have it any other way.

315
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,594
Hold on, Louie! Hold on!
Hold on!

316
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,402
Hold on, Louie!
Stay with me! Louie!

317
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,834
He's awake!

318
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,309
Hey, Daisy.
Looking pretty cute today.

319
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,152
Uh, hey, folks.
The jet stream's moving a lot. . .

320
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:33,290
. . .these days, and it's, uh, really sort of
traveling in a direction here. . .

321
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,685
. . .and it's spawning these little spinning
depressive things

322
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,793
that's hovering right above our heads.

323
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:39,928
Hey, baby.

324
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,459
Hey!

325
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,196
Big day.
You ready to go home?

326
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,204
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

327
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,429
Watching your favorite show?

328
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,605
Yeah.

329
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,476
To the north and into the east,
bringing a lot of punch.

330
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,645
Wear that raincoat out there.

331
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,873
They all got it wrong.

332
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,976
Don't worry about them, okay?

333
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,111
Jack called.

334
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,756
They've got a whole
new show planned for you.

335
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,382
Tornado Man.

336
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,286
What?

337
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,786
Baby, Tornado Man!

338
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,264
This is going to get you
on the anchor track.

339
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,661
That was no tornado, Ange.

340
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,597
You don't know
what you're talking about.

341
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,196
You're a celebrity now.

342
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,171
- A celeb. . . What are you talking about?
- You're Tornado Man!

343
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,705
Okay, you have to see this video.

344
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,310
You're probably the only person
who's not seen this.

345
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,217
Almost two million views!

346
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,288
Notice how it's shredded.

347
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,521
What l am saying is that the jet stream
as we have known it

348
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,057
has changed, fundamentally.

349
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,696
That's fascinating, Sunny.
So, what are we looking at in our future?

350
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,302
l mean in terms of weather?

351
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,837
lt-it's kind of hard to tell from here,
but...

352
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,039
What is that?

353
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,454
Louie!

354
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,757
Louie, hold on. . .

355
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:24,896
lsn't that amazing?

356
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,435
lt has almost two million views.

357
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,199
Okay, and wait until you see this.

358
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,836
You're even on a t-shirt.

359
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,280
You know what, Ange, l mean,
that's great. Yeah, a million views.

360
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,478
But Louie is dead. l...

361
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,447
How do you think this makes me feel?

362
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,391
- Yeah, it's... l know.
- l took him out there.

363
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,326
- He was my responsibility.
- Baby, it was an accident.

364
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,391
No. No it wasn't, Ange.

365
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,192
Listen to me.

366
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,395
l got a call from those anonymous people,
and they warned me not to go out there. . .

367
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,032
. . .but l went out there anyway.

368
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,234
Do you hear what l'm saying?
They told me not to go!

369
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,978
Steve... l've stood by you for two years,
helping you rebuild your life.

370
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:17,181
And suddenly, this great opportunity
has come along, and...

371
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,718
Look, l feel bad for Louie and his family,
too, believe me, l do, but...

372
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,118
no matter what you do now,

373
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,852
there's no bringing him back.

374
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,993
Will you just think about it?

375
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,063
l'm going to go and handle
your release papers, okay?

376
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,508
All right.

377
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,129
lt's-it's kind of hard to tell from here
but. . .

378
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,766
What is that?

379
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,661
What is that?

380
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,031
That's fascinating, Sunny.
So, what are we looking at in our future?

381
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,607
l mean, in terms of weather?

382
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,108
lt-it's kind of hard to tell from here,
but. . .

383
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,250
What is that. . .

384
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,283
Hello.

385
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,154
Hey, yo, yo, yo, is this Tornado Man?
Do l have the honor?

386
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,327
Uh, hey, Jack.

387
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,064
How's it all coming together, buddy?
l understand you're almost on your feet.

388
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,698
So, when can l expect you back?
l want Tornado Man on the air!

389
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,095
Yeah, you know, l'm not sure
l want to be back on the air.

390
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,700
Whoa.
What the hell are you talking about?

391
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,277
You know,
with Louie and everything, l just,

392
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,506
l don't know if l want to be
a weatherman anymore, Jack.

393
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,250
Steve...

394
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,979
listen to me, buddy.

395
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,719
Bad things happen to good people.

396
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:03,316
Now, you want to spend your life moping
or you want to move on?

397
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,354
- l just... l don't know if l can get. . .
- Listen to me.

398
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,493
You've got a bright future.
You've got to weather these things.

399
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,168
- You understand what l'm saying?
- Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,268
So, when can l expect you back?

401
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,275
When's Tornado Man coming back?

402
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,679
Jack, listen, l just need some time, man.
l can't commit right now.

403
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,273
Okay, Steve, be straight with me.

404
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,245
Are you fielding other offers right now?
lf so who are you talking to?

405
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,711
lt's not like that Jack, all right?
l gotta go.

406
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,921
- Wait, hold on a sec. Hang on a sec. . .
- l got another call.

407
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:34,887
Damn.

408
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,854
lt's gotta be CNN.

409
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,803
Oh, man.

410
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,363
We're relieved to hear you
survived the incident.

411
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,068
Yeah? Who is ''we'' exactly?

412
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,471
That information cannot be
disclosed at this time.

413
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,136
What do you people want from me?

414
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,782
Access to the data figures to predict the
location of the event.

415
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,751
You know what data l used.

416
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,519
What model did you use
to make the prediction?

417
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,620
You want answers from me?

418
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,616
You're going to have
to answer my questions.

419
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,191
Sounds to me like you
guys opened Pandora's Box

420
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,988
and let out something
you can't control.

421
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,265
Why don't you guys just tell me
who this is?

422
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,698
- We are asking the questions.
- No. . . l'm asking the questions!

423
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,029
l went out there!
l got someone killed!

424
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,063
l want some answers!

425
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,202
You were warned.
You did not heed our warning.

426
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,307
This conversation's over.

427
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,925
Oh, boy, the bloody schedule is shot.

428
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,197
There's half a dozen lorries
behind this one, come on!

429
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,197
Get a bloody move on!

430
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,172
You what?

431
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,472
Say what?

432
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,745
What did you say to me, boy?

433
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,949
Well, thank you.

434
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,393
Thank you.

435
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,164
You're all right you are.

436
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,448
Fish?

437
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:06,273
ln London a freak weather condition
caused fish to rain from the sky.

438
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:11,244
They're estimating nearly 100,000 fish
came down in the space of just a few minutes.

439
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,679
Experts say, a cyclone in the Atlantic
was responsible

440
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,648
for what many are taking to be

441
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,913
- a biblical sign of the end of days.
- Where we come from. . .

442
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,526
. . .there's a legend, prophecy,
that say. . .

443
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,758
. . .that when a man challenge God...

444
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,188
. . .he is purged. . .

445
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:28,423
Hey!

446
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,264
ls this how you're planning
on spending your day again?

447
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,592
What?

448
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,164
ln front of the computer
with the TV on, like. . .

449
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,572
. . .some kind of loser?

450
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,538
Come on, baby,
is this what losers look like?

451
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,678
You don't want me
to answer that question.

452
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,842
Hey, doctor said l should stay
off my feet for a week.

453
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,853
He said that two weeks ago, okay?

454
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,352
Ever since you came out
of your coma...

455
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,616
. . .you've been obsessing
about this not-atornado thing.

456
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,720
Well, it turns out,
my hunch may be right.

457
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,651
Something is destabilizing
the jet stream,

458
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,826
and it's becoming dangerous
and unpredictable.

459
00:29:59,097 --> 00:29:59,995
Okay, stop it, Steve.

460
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,026
You're not a scientist anymore.

461
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,231
Actually, l was working
on my Ph.D in Meteorology

462
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,366
and Atmospheric Engineering.

463
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,237
Okay, don't talk to me like l'm stupid.
You know that l hate that.

464
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:16,106
All right, look, um, l'm sorry, baby.
lt's just, you know l...

465
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,213
Look, okay.

466
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,684
Whatever you were. . .

467
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,077
. . .they're never going to
let you be that again.

468
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,683
l'm sorry, but...

469
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,322
. . .that part of your life is over.

470
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,924
You have a new life now, with me, and...

471
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,853
instead of giving it a go,
you're just throwing it away.

472
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,264
You should be capitalizing
on this YouTube video thing.

473
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,004
- Oh, come on, YouTube? Are you. . .
- No, l mean, you know, TV, a book deal.

474
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,337
At least renegotiate
your contract with the station. But. . .

475
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,311
. . .all you're doing is sitting
in front of the computer,

476
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,642
researching something that
nobody believes ever happened.

477
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,342
lt was a freak accident, okay?

478
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,144
A tornado.

479
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,926
And now you're just in this
vicious downward spiral.

480
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,185
Wait a second, what did you just say?

481
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,192
- lt was a tornado.
- No, no, after that.

482
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,992
Vicious downward spiral?

483
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,405
Oh, my God. . . that... that's it.
That's what l've been looking for.

484
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,468
- That's brilliant.
- What?

485
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,333
You just said something that helped me
solve this problem that

486
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,211
l've been working on for, like, a month.

487
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,476
What are you doing?

488
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,240
Oh, my God.

489
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,482
Baby, you have no. . .

490
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,225
- Steve. . .
- This is huge. You have no idea.

491
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,459
l've got to go to work.

492
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,298
Ange!

493
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,514
Are you seriously considering allowing
a pile of fish to derail this program?

494
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,223
The British are asking questions.

495
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,087
Their experts believe this was
a motivated incident.

496
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,121
We'll be in a politically vulnerable position
when the program is revealed.

497
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:21,236
And why would we ever feel
a need to reveal it?

498
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,142
Our fingerprints have
to remain invisible, Major.

499
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,109
Let me... let me clarify something.

500
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,476
This weapons system leaves
no fingerprint whatsoever.

501
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,555
We're on the verge of transforming
America's strategic position

502
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:43,020
back to a level where
we will again be... unstoppable.

503
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,652
lf we discontinue this program,

504
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,057
do you think the Chinese will?

505
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,524
What about the Russians?

506
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,070
We need to swallow our fears and
remember what we're fighting for.

507
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,343
This is all well understood, Major.

508
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,382
However, we must warn you,

509
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,314
the success of this program
will have many fathers,

510
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,714
but its failure will be an orphan.
Are we clear?

511
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,280
Yes.

512
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,791
We're clear.

513
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,360
Thank you for your confidence.

514
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,458
What can l do for you, Doctor?

515
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,358
Security's been tracking
Steve Simpson's research.

516
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,499
The weatherman.

517
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,963
Yeah.
He may have had a breakthrough.

518
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,264
l have it keyed up down below
if you'd like to take a look.

519
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,873
The weatherman solved
a billion-dollar problem

520
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,942
that an entire research
facility couldn't?

521
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,247
More like discovered a deeper problem.

522
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,146
Go on.

523
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,750
When we took control of
the jet stream and accelerated it,

524
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,851
we destabilized
a natural phenomenon.

525
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,750
The higher speeds might have led
to a complex series of...

526
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,317
...chain reactions that may be
impossible to model.

527
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,021
Doctor, l know all this.

528
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,126
But l feel that it's leading to a complete
breakdown of many processes

529
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,358
- that have contributed to. . .
- Bottom line it.

530
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:03,203
lmagine the jet stream cycling the world,
accelerating itself over and over again.

531
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,538
At first, it might create
many jet streams,

532
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,869
splintering off unpredictably, randomly,
from the source.

533
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,546
But soon, as it increases in power,
the rogue streams grow as well,

534
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,985
increasing in size, growing
to be larger than any city,

535
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,352
any country, any continent.

536
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,124
They engulf the entire planet.

537
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,492
So how do we control it?

538
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,219
l don't think we can.

539
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,593
No. Wrong answer.
How do we control it?

540
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,795
We have passed the tipping
point here, Major.

541
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,066
No.

542
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:39,038
We were the catalyst, we created it,
that means we can control it.

543
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,912
l'm going to ask you one more time,
how do we control it?

544
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:48,307
l'm telling you that life on this planet is
about to face a major readjustment. . .

545
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,848
Do you think you're the first scientist...

546
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,546
to say it's the end of the world?

547
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,788
When they dropped the atom bomb,
they all said, ''Oh it's the end of the world.''

548
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,328
When they developed
the neutron bomb, they said,

549
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,230
again, lt's the end of the world.
Let me give you a hint.

550
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,200
The only thing that leads to the end
of the world is the end of the world.

551
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,442
lf we started it we can control it, and
that's exactly what we're gonna do.

552
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,309
l just...

553
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,315
l think that... l'm just. . .
. . .missing some pieces of the puzzle.

554
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,747
l need some help.

555
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:30,317
You have all the resources
of the United States military.

556
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,330
l need to bring Simpson in.

557
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,227
The weatherman again.

558
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,829
How do you think he's gonna feel
when he sees you?

559
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,338
How will he react. . .

560
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,206
. . .when he looks around

561
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:52,248
and sees his life's work
has been weaponized?

562
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,979
He only needs to understand
the more mundane uses of Thor.

563
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:02,890
We created all this
to bring rain to the desert.

564
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,593
- That's my problem.
- No.

565
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:11,398
Your problems are my problems,
and l don't want to carry your baggage.

566
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,966
Fine.
We need to bring in Simpson.

567
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,749
Bring in the weatherman.

568
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,355
Hey, it's sunny in Seattle!

569
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,689
So let's take a look
at how the day's developing

570
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,396
with Chopper Phil
and the morning traffic report.

571
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,232
Steve?

572
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,762
Uh, yeah, l'm down here, honey.
l...

573
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,631
l fell asleep at my desk.

574
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,541
Baby, you should take it easy
on yourself.

575
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,935
What were you doing?

576
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,640
You know what?

577
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,342
l'm really not quite sure
what l was doing.

578
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,910
But...

579
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,722
l think l have a feeling
l know what l'm doing today.

580
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,791
Yeah? What's that?

581
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,830
l'm going to go in,
l'm going to talk to Jack, and, uh,

582
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,061
maybe we'll launch this
Tornado Man thing,

583
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,998
You know.
Maybe he'll give me a show.

584
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,935
l'll make it fun with some fun facts,
you know, um,

585
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,538
. . .mix in some of that

586
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,342
Weatherman Gone Wild stuff, l guess.

587
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,241
That sounds great, baby.

588
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,344
You know, it's still pretty early.

589
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,412
You want to come upstairs
for a snuggle?

590
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,125
Hey.

591
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,319
You want some breakfast?

592
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,357
No, l'm good.
l'm going to grab something at the office.

593
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,026
l want to get in and close Jack,
you know?

594
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,263
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.

595
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,227
See, l told you,
it's good to let go sometimes.

596
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,260
Yeah, you know?
What's the worst that could happen?

597
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,405
The end of the world?

598
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,501
Well, it's not.

599
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,374
What was l thinking?

600
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,285
Hey, you want to grab lunch
at the Green Tavern?

601
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,954
Yeah, sure.

602
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,987
All right, sounds good.

603
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,722
Don't be late, all right?

604
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,194
Good morning, sir.

605
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,320
Are you Steven Simpson?

606
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:54,963
Yeah.

607
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,360
l'm Agent Bo.

608
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,999
l'm going to need you
to come with us.

609
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,503
Hey, uh, sweetie don't forget
to make a reservation.

610
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,468
You know how crazy it gets there.

611
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,671
Uh, yeah, sure.
l got it covered. Don't-don't sweat it.

612
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,205
- Right now?
- Yes, sir.

613
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,114
What's this about?

614
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,276
lt's a matter of national security.

615
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,288
Do you understand?

616
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,057
Who are you talking to sweetie?

617
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,458
Oh, uh... l'm just talking to myself, baby.
You know, a little. . .

618
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,234
my crazy morning talk.
That kind of stuff.

619
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,003
We need to go, sir.

620
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,602
All right, but just give me
a second, okay?

621
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,283
Uh...

622
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,285
You know what?
The funniest thing.

623
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,345
l don't think l can make lunch.
Something just came up.

624
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,982
What is it?

625
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,792
lt-it's Jack. He, um, he wants to go over
some ideas for this new show.

626
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:04,392
But how did he know you were even coming in?
You just told me this morning.

627
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,439
Uh, it's... l know,
it's just a crazy coincidence.

628
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,631
Great minds think alike, you know?

629
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,206
Right. Okay, well, um, good luck.

630
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,413
All right, l gotta go.
l love you. Bye. Bye.

631
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:39,900
Sorry.

632
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,560
No outside communications.

633
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,471
Dude, you just rejected
my girlfriend's call.

634
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,270
You know what she's gonna do?

635
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,269
You must be a single fellow.

636
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,337
Must be.

637
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,942
Here, take a look at this.

638
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,246
Wow.

639
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,890
Top-secret document just for me?

640
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,275
Come on, come on!

641
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,155
We have breaking news coming in.

642
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,689
The Midwestern town of Madison,
Wisconsin was apparently

643
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,984
wiped off the map today

644
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,389
after what we're hearing might have
been the most powerful tornado on record.

645
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,991
lt touched down just moments ago.

646
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,171
- Collateral damage, Major?
- Success doesn't come without a price.

647
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,303
Now, put on your big-boy pants
and get back to work.

648
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,250
What is this place?

649
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,080
This is the operations room.

650
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,717
What's it for?

651
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,592
Why don't you go talk
to your buddy over there?

652
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,463
l'm sure he'll fill you in.

653
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,359
Hello, Steve.

654
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:59,104
Wow.
Now it all makes sense.

655
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,246
Who else would have knowledge
of my thesis but not understand it

656
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,914
. . .besides the guy who stole it?

657
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,181
- l didn't steal it from you.
- Really?

658
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,947
You know, we were partners for six years.
You were my friend.

659
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,121
And you turn around, you accuse me of
stealing government documents?

660
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,883
Plagiarism?
You testify against me!

661
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,053
- lt's not that simple, Steve.
- l guess not.

662
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,022
Because you up and vanished.

663
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,066
You know, the people back home,

664
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,034
they actually thought l had something
to do with your disappearance.

665
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,468
But the whole time, you were here,
wherever the hell we are,

666
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,312
working on some
secret government program.

667
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,782
You wanted to publish,
to give it all away.

668
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,783
Our gift to humanity?

669
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,117
Listen, Mr. Open Source,

670
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:45,452
did you really think the government

671
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,114
was just going to let you give
that kind of power away?

672
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,186
Daniel, what have you done?

673
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,358
Tell me you've not turned this
into a weapon.

674
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,190
Same ideals.

675
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,057
Using weather
for the betterment of Man.

676
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,369
lt's just under better control now.

677
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,040
- Look, l didn't have a choice!
- Everyone has a choice!

678
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,632
That's true.

679
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,941
So now you have to make a choice,
Mr. Simpson.

680
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,183
And who the hell are you?

681
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,517
Major Nicholas Shaw,
United States Air Force.

682
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,285
The genie's out of the bottle.

683
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,384
So, you two...

684
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,554
. . .can work together.

685
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,196
Or you can die together.

686
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,731
Feilder's choice.

687
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,133
A hundred square miles
just wiped off the map.

688
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,911
Why is this happening?

689
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,638
Well, when you geniuses
accelerated the jet stream,

690
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,646
because of the magnetic field,
it created a dynamo.

691
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,249
The faster it goes,
the more energy it creates.

692
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,988
But unlike a real dynamo,

693
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,749
there's no friction at 40,000 feet
to slow it down.

694
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:06,060
lnstead, there's this natural push
from the warming effect of the sun

695
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,820
and the Earth's rotation.

696
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,961
l... hadn't thought it out.

697
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,861
Yeah, well next time you mess
with the planet, you might want to.

698
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,999
Oh, what am l talking about?

699
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:16,996
There ain't gonna be no next time.

700
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,610
You having fun, Mr. Simpson?

701
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,046
- Well. . .
- Look at me. Focus.

702
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:27,077
Now, we need to get back on point
and figure out how to control it.

703
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,785
The question is, how do you stop that
which is unstoppable?

704
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,229
That's it.

705
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:45,735
l got it.

706
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,370
The only force strong enough to spin
down the jet stream is the jet stream itself.

707
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,234
We splinter off a portion of the stream,

708
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,078
turn it around,
ram it back into the main current.

709
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,914
Make a U-turn and slam it back
into the main stream?

710
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,844
- Yeah.
- That's your big idea?

711
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,642
Yeah, genius. Sometimes the simplest
ones are the best ones.

712
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,916
Unfortunately, we don't have
nearly that kind of control.

713
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,259
Well, if you take into account
the dynamo effect,

714
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,420
and build in the algorithms,
we would.

715
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,161
We've had hundreds of scientists,

716
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,663
the best minds in the world,
working on this for years.

717
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,900
What makes you think you're right?

718
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,900
A hunch?

719
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,113
A hunch.

720
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,249
A weatherman's intuition.

721
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,680
Let's get to work.

722
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:46,788
You ready for this, boys?

723
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,058
All right, let's do it.

724
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,978
Phew! That is a big plane.

725
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,917
Oh, no, no don't! Please.

726
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,616
l told you, no outside communications.

727
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,894
Come on, man
let me just call her back. Please?

728
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,726
This is going to make her a little bit crazy.
She goes nuts when l reject her calls.

729
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,000
Now with the first rejection
back in the car,

730
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,463
l can explain that.
l can sell that, make it look like an accident.

731
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,264
But a second one?
That's a serious offence.

732
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:31,863
Mr. Simpson.

733
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,643
l don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

734
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,673
And it's really not my problem.

735
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,243
- Persistent, isn't she?
- That's my girl.

736
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,522
- No, no, please don't! Don't, don't, don't!
- Hey!

737
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:50,220
l'm rejecting her call,
not putting a bullet in her kneecap.

738
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,223
Listen to me.

739
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,590
She will call the phone company
and place a trace on this call.

740
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,796
You don't need that.

741
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,663
What l don't need is a breach
of security protocol.

742
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,596
l understand, l promise you.

743
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,167
You can sit right here
and listen to everything l say.

744
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,172
lf l say one thing that's not kosher,
you can shoot me.

745
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,438
Put a bullet in my kneecap
or whatever you call it in your world.

746
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,337
Don't tempt me, Mr. Simpson.

747
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,115
Now, whatever you say,
it can't be the truth. . .

748
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,510
- . . .or anywhere near it.
- Okay, okay.

749
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,050
- Got it?
- l got it. l got it! Thank you.

750
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,151
Hey, hey, baby!

751
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,782
Steve where are you?
l called your office.

752
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,488
You haven't been in all day.
What are you doing?

753
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,589
- Uh, you know, um... something came up.
- Steve!

754
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,531
Okay, all right, um, honey,
l'm at a meeting.

755
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,434
You're at a meeting? lt's 10:00 p.m. at night.
Who are you with?

756
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,639
Well, um... This, uh...

757
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,539
. . .Bolivian coffee magnate.
Hugo Chavez.

758
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,311
He wants to fly me down to Bolivia

759
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,177
and study weather patterns that
are affecting their coffee crop.

760
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,709
Are you being serious right now?

761
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:53,879
Do you think l'm stupid?
Hugo Chavez is the president of Venezuela.

762
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,226
- Dummy, dummy!
- What's that sound?

763
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,219
Are you at an airport?

764
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,229
Uh. . . yeah.
l'm going on a trip, to Bolivia.

765
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,190
With Hugo Chavez.

766
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,993
Okay, Steve, are you with that girl?

767
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,373
Babe. . . there is no other girl.
l'm just caught up in a situation.

768
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,041
- Right. Right, Steve, okay. . .
- Ange, you've got to trust me on this one.

769
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,211
l promise you there is no other girl.

770
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,313
Okay, but you need to tell me
where you are exactly.

771
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,322
- An airport.
- What airport, Steve?

772
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:31,023
Uh, l don't know.
Honestly, l have no idea.

773
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:36,198
- Why? Why are you lying to me?
- Okay, time's up, 007.

774
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,134
Listen, baby l've gotta go.
l should be home, um, tomorrow.

775
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,064
l love you.
l love you so much. Okay, bye.

776
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,363
Steve!

777
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,479
What?

778
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,081
- Feel better now?
- Yeah, just great.

779
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,899
Looks like Mr. Simpson's prediction
is holding true.

780
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,796
We have a rogue jet stream forming
just off the west coast.

781
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,441
We only have one shot at this.
Let's make it count, people.

782
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,601
Failure is not an option.

783
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,116
Now give me com one.
Check.

784
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,483
And hydraulics.

785
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:36,882
Check.

786
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,320
All right, com two.

787
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:39,488
Check.

788
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,320
All right, give me 20 degrees.

789
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,263
Check.

790
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,191
Let's get this show on the road.

791
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,847
We have a bearing on the center
of the convergence.

792
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:42,480
Altitude 10,000 feet,
speed 350 miles per hour.

793
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,991
lt's going to be a bumpy ride, boys.

794
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,554
Buckle up.

795
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,192
We're in for a bumpy ride?
But we're going to be safe, right?

796
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,894
This is a big jet.
lt can handle the shearing forces, yeah?

797
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,365
Sure.
That's what these planes are built for.

798
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,713
Danger! Danger! Danger!

799
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,216
No problem.

800
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,753
Great. l feel safer already.

801
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:24,995
There it is.

802
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:28,294
Jet stream convergence is just ahead.
Everyone, batten down the hatches.

803
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,095
l'm not sure how this is gonna go.

804
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,273
Here we go!

805
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,275
Come on.
Come on, baby, hold on.

806
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:44,284
Give me 10 degree flap.

807
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,350
10 degrees.

808
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,192
l got power spiking
in generators three and four.

809
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,054
- You want me to take them offline?
- Negative, we're going to have to ride it out.

810
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,994
What the hell is going on back there?

811
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,663
l don't know, man.
l think he was electrocuted!

812
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,065
Jesus!
Check his pulse.

813
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,834
No pulse! Beginning CPR!

814
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,209
You're doing it all wrong.

815
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,183
l got this, man.
l saw this on Baywatch!

816
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:16,484
Move!

817
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:20,181
Come on.

818
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,323
Come on! Stay with me.

819
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,733
We've got to turn around.
This man needs help.

820
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,037
Not anymore.

821
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,268
Aw, come on!

822
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,273
Military operations don't just end
because people die, Mr. Simpson.

823
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,876
Now get to your workstations
while l secure the body.

824
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,288
Now.

825
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,290
Go.

826
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,318
Military mission...

827
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,997
This is purely a weapon. This has nothing
to do with making it rain in the desert.

828
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,864
- That's what l've been trying to tell you.
- You turned my work into a loaded gun!

829
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,238
They were going to steal it anyway.

830
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,808
l tried to guide it and keep humanitarian
but l was wrong.

831
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,404
- Oh. . . Jesus.
- You were right the whole time.

832
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,074
Absolute power.

833
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,338
Corrupts absolutely.

834
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:28,983
This is it, gentlemen.

835
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,591
Ground zero for the jet stream
is Seattle, Washington,

836
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,388
then moving southbound all
the way down the Pacific coast.

837
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:36,390
lt's now or never.

838
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,596
Copy.

839
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,630
Game time.

840
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,372
Target area is 20,000 meters
at your 10:00.

841
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,276
Roger. Closing on target.

842
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,310
Closing on target.

843
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,713
Commencing dispersal... now.

844
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,523
Releasing now.

845
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,632
They're gone.
First databurst coming in three... two...

846
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,108
. . .one.

847
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,201
Plugging data into Little Blue.

848
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,244
Whoa!

849
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,694
68% , Major.

850
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,154
That's already higher
than we've ever achieved.

851
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,193
This weatherman
is proving to be an asset.

852
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,177
lt's beautiful.

853
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,594
The level of detail is amazing.

854
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,962
Alluring, isn't it?

855
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,301
75% still rising.

856
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,742
We've reached 80% accuracy.

857
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,544
We may pull this thing out yet,
gentlemen.

858
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,085
Good work.

859
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,313
They're going to be naming
high schools after you, football stadiums.

860
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,958
120 seconds left of probes.

861
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,227
Copy. Switching to max projective.
We'll begin bursting.

862
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,359
But we're only at 81 % .

863
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,794
81 % is the highest
we've ever achieved.

864
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,062
We normally work
at a much lower percentage.

865
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,239
60% is considered a success.

866
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:02,341
Oh, yeah, l forgot. Collateral damage
never was an issue for you guys.

867
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,639
Guess not.

868
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,346
We have extreme acceleration.

869
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,290
They are leading the stream, sir.

870
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:21,661
Okay.

871
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,359
Let's save the world.

872
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,639
Beginning repositioning maneuver.

873
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,275
We have control of the stream.

874
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,884
Still go on reposition.

875
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:48,283
Dan, l think we may have a problem.

876
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,552
lt's all good. We're still within mission
parameters. Maintain course change.

877
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,354
Everything's good on our side.

878
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,630
Losing predictive accuracy!
Down to 73% .

879
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:08,207
No, 64% . We're losing control
of the jet stream!

880
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,983
- l have total system failure!
- Failure is not an option.

881
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,582
Hang in there.
We have to get control of the stream.

882
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,044
l need a solution.

883
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,548
Yeah, but l don't have one.

884
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,394
The system's locked up!

885
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,190
The splinter's going
to lose coherence any second.

886
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,934
l'm taking Little Blue offline.

887
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:36,239
Why?

888
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,968
You're going to have to control
the plasma discharges Steve.

889
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,241
- Do it manually.
- Manually?

890
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,867
Blue is making trillions
of operations per second.

891
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,771
Little Blue's a computer. You're intuitive.
lt'll fire wherever you point.

892
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,112
l have no idea where to point it!

893
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,350
Do it, Steve! Use your gut!

894
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,214
- l'm a weatherman!
- Just do it, damnit!

895
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,314
- This is ridiculous. lt's not working.
- Keep trying!

896
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,282
Coherence failure seconds away.

897
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,129
Dude, this isn't working.

898
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,128
l'm just not the guy, man.

899
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,301
Listen to me. You know we have
a massive storm convergence growing.

900
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:13,563
- l know.
- lf we don't stop it now,

901
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,896
every city on the west coast is going
to be wiped out.

902
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,208
Seattle's at ground zero,
so come on.

903
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,433
- l know. . .
- Use your gut.

904
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,744
l know what's happening!
lt's just impossible!

905
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,080
No way.

906
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,416
Hey!
You are not going to answer that!

907
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,217
- lt's Angel.
- No kidding!

908
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,191
What kind of service do you have?

909
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:42,395
Hey, baby.

910
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,362
Why is it so loud?

911
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,664
Steve, will you please
just tell me where you are?

912
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,836
l wish l could.

913
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,509
l don't understand
why you're lying to me.

914
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,647
lt's not as if you're on some secret
U.S. mission or something.

915
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:08,188
Ange, um,
everything is going to be fine.

916
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,182
No, it's not, Steve.

917
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,985
You can't just hurt me like this
and lie to me, and,

918
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,527
worst of all,
not even tell me where you are.

919
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,132
- Ange, listen to me. Listen to me. . .
- When you decide that you really love me,

920
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,361
you can give me a call.

921
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,240
No, no, no, Ange! Ange!

922
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,810
Damnit! Damnit!

923
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,675
- Angel's moving out.
- Yeah, like that's a big surprise.

924
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,240
Steve, do that again.

925
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,306
Do what again?

926
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,508
Steve, Angel's leaving you, right?

927
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,278
- Yeah.
- How does that make you feel?

928
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,217
lt makes me feel mad.

929
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,150
- lt makes you feel angry, right?
- Yeah, really angry.

930
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,750
What about me?
What about what l did to you?

931
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,552
l stole your life.
Does that make you angry?

932
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,594
Yeah, it makes me really angry.
You piss me off. You sold me out!

933
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,230
- What else? Tell me what else.
- Agent Bo back over there,

934
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,434
he pisses me off! He's an idiot
with a smirk on his face!

935
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,832
- What. . . What else makes you angry?
- This mission pisses me off!

936
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,244
And that weather station
KPQR, and Jack. . .

937
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,303
. . .the guy who wants me to be the
Weatherman Gone Wild.

938
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,342
He makes me go crazy!

939
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,176
What about the jet stream?
Does that make you angry?

940
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,848
The jet stream makes me crazy!
l wanna go insane!

941
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,955
- l hate the jet stream!
- All right. . . you hate the jet stream!

942
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,190
- l hate the freaking jet stream!
- All right, let's do this!

943
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,087
l hate it! l hate the jet stream!

944
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,729
l hate the jet stream! l hate it!
l hate the jet stream!

945
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,004
Coherence is strengthening.

946
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:09,076
Nice.

947
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,513
You're doing it! You're doing it!
The jet stream's refocusing!

948
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:19,713
l'm doing it! l'm doing it!
l can do this! l can do this!

949
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:22,319
Let's bring this sucker around, baby!

950
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,753
You heard him!
Let's complete the maneuver!

951
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:28,995
- Copy! Resuming maneuver.
- Bring it around! Bring this sucker around!

952
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,793
Yeah!

953
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,196
Full coherence restored.

954
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:35,963
Excellent, gentlemen.

955
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,296
lt's working.
We're within mission parameters.

956
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,472
We're a go for phase three.
Let's collide the streams.

957
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,049
Brace yourselves! Here we go!

958
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,785
Here we go!

959
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,312
What's our status?

960
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,983
Jet stream is normalizing.

961
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,443
Confirm that, please.

962
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,715
Confirmed, sir.
Jet stream is normalized.

963
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:29,750
Nice work.

964
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,759
Nice work, everybody.
l'll be in my office.

965
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,759
Yes, sir.

966
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,666
Good job. We did it. We did it!

967
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,105
No, you did it.

968
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,071
Unbelievable.

969
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:59,111
- Unbelievable.
- What?

970
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,081
What?

971
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,556
The accuracy indicator says 99% .

972
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,195
99% accuracy?

973
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,799
How's that even possible?

974
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:15,830
Little Blue learned
from what you were doing.

975
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,439
lt's solved the dynamic air flow model.

976
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,797
Completely.

977
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:43,994
l'm happy to report Thor's Hammer
is a fully operational weapon system.

978
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:51,839
Excellent work, Major.

979
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:56,637
What do you think's going
to happen now?

980
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,504
What do you mean?
We're heading back to base.

981
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,974
Yeah, we're heading back to base
with a fully operational weapons system.

982
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,876
What do you think's
going to happen to us?

983
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,853
A guy just died, and Captain America
over there played it off

984
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,321
like it was a bump in the road.

985
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:10,922
Do you think they're
going to let us go back to our regular lives?

986
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,022
l don't have a regular life.

987
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,696
Major, we have
a security issue up here.

988
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,099
Requesting a green light.

989
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,437
You got it.

990
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,877
l need you to safeguard Little Blue
and secure the transmission of all its data.

991
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,548
Am l making myself clear?

992
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,180
Yes, sir.

993
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:57,203
Sergeant, open up
a high-speed secure channel.

994
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,401
We're going to download their data.

995
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:00,840
Yes, sir.

996
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:06,839
Listen to me.

997
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,978
We'll never know when
or where they're going to use it,

998
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,252
'cause we'll never leave that base alive.

999
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,355
l say we wipe the drives on that thing.

1000
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,290
Gentlemen. . .

1001
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:19,990
we have orders
to open a secure channel

1002
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,992
and then upload all data from
Little Blue back to base.

1003
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,365
Why?

1004
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,907
l'm going to need you to step away
from this terminal.

1005
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,409
Yeah, well, that ain't going to happen.

1006
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:41,175
Dr. Berg, begin the upload.

1007
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:43,347
Daniel...

1008
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,651
Daniel don't do it.

1009
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,224
Once they get the data,
they're going to kill both of us.

1010
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,363
Hey, Simpson, what's your problem?

1011
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,028
You helped save the world.
Your country appreciates that.

1012
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,361
Where's all this hostility coming from?

1013
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,669
You heard the Major.

1014
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,606
You guys stole my work once.

1015
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,432
There's no way in hell
you're doing it again.

1016
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,340
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, all right, all right. Chill, chill.

1017
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,745
Dr. Berg,

1018
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:16,147
begin the upload... now.

1019
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,286
lt's Angel!

1020
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,196
No!

1021
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,262
No!

1022
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:44,546
That's gunfire.

1023
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,280
Get back there and see
what's going on.

1024
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,685
The next one's going
to be right through your heart.

1025
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,513
Do you understand Simpson?

1026
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:06,826
Now, for the last time, Dr. Berg,
start the upload.

1027
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,750
That's better.

1028
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,426
Hey, Jim, what's going on here?

1029
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,622
l heard weapon fire.

1030
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:36,628
lt's okay, Lieutenant.

1031
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,229
l've got everything under control.

1032
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,293
Cut it off.

1033
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,198
l said, cut it off!

1034
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,834
Put the gun down.

1035
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,431
Shut it down.

1036
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,602
l swear, l'll shoot. Shut it down!

1037
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,608
l'll shoot you!

1038
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,310
Are you really that good?

1039
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,286
Are you sure
you won't hit your buddy over here?

1040
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,222
- Behind you!
- Put your gun down.

1041
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,190
Don't move!

1042
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,632
Get back! Get back!

1043
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,198
Don't you move.

1044
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:47,832
Okay.

1045
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,034
Look, you've had your fun.

1046
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,468
Why don't you put the gun away
before you hurt yourself?

1047
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,541
Get back! Get back!

1048
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,570
You've got to be the worst shot
l've ever seen.

1049
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,430
Really?

1050
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:34,282
Oh, crap.

1051
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:44,350
Help me!

1052
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,527
Grab my hand!

1053
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,295
Help!

1054
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,838
- Hold on!
- Come on!

1055
01:12:58,907 --> 01:12:59,805
Come on!

1056
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,939
No!

1057
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,281
No!

1058
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,047
The mission's been compromised!

1059
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,648
Possible structural damage.

1060
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,278
- l need clearance to land immediately!
- What is the ETA of that plane?

1061
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,385
At their current rate and altitude,
about 15 minutes.

1062
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:23,562
- And the status on that data download?
- Should complete in nine minutes,

1063
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,629
- as long as there are no interruptions.
- Patch me through to the captain.

1064
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:28,700
Done.

1065
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,871
Captain, what is the status
of your plane?

1066
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:35,867
Co-pilot is not responding.

1067
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:39,238
ln emergency descent.
Again, requesting clearance to land!

1068
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,579
Captain l need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1069
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,118
l need you to put the plane
on auto-pilot right now.

1070
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:48,015
l need you to go back to the control room
and secure the data download.

1071
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,349
- Do you understand me?
- Major,

1072
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:53,325
l do not recommend that l leave the
cockpit until l land this plane.

1073
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:56,222
That is a direct order, Captain.

1074
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,456
Captain!

1075
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,299
Damnit.

1076
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:28,861
Better?

1077
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,827
Yeah, thanks!

1078
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:33,200
You are crazy, man.

1079
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,798
What the hell is going on back here?

1080
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,050
Danny you've been shot!

1081
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,120
Stop the upload!

1082
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,192
Danny, hang on there.
l'll be right back!

1083
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,929
The upload was completed!

1084
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,497
We're below 10,000 feet!
You don't need a mask!

1085
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:45,463
Get me to the cockpit!

1086
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:49,705
- Do you know how to fly this plane?
- l learned a lot from these bastards!

1087
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:53,275
- What do you have in mind?
- Just get me to the cockpit!

1088
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,239
All right, brother, let's do this!

1089
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,456
You got it? You got it?

1090
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,994
Listen to me,
you need to get off this plane.

1091
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,597
Get off the plane?

1092
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,198
How am l going to do that?

1093
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,306
Parachute.

1094
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,238
Are you out of your mind?

1095
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,840
Steve, you want to live?

1096
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:25,735
You need to get to the back of the plane,
put on a chute and get out of here.

1097
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,912
Danny, l am not going
to leave you here.

1098
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,346
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Turning the systems back online.

1099
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:37,347
We just saved the world!
Why would you turn it back on?

1100
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,026
One more swing of Thor's Hammer.

1101
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:51,372
- you need to think this through.
- Steve. . .

1102
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,407
Steve. . . for once in your life,

1103
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,265
you need to listen to me.

1104
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,273
l'm taking this stream straight back
into the base.

1105
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,741
This whole program
ends here and now.

1106
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,146
Strap on that parachute
and get the hell out of here.

1107
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,278
l am not going to leave you here to die.

1108
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:08,915
Look at me.

1109
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,490
l got a bullet in my gut.

1110
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,722
l got maybe 10 minutes to live
before l bleed to death.

1111
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,127
We knew that this might be
a one-way trip.

1112
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,364
l don't want to go out of here

1113
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,497
knowing that Shaw might win this.

1114
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,397
No, man, no. We take out the base,

1115
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,800
- we land this beast, l get you to a hospital. . .
- Steve!

1116
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,840
- Everything will be fine!
- Steve! Steve that's not happening.

1117
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,311
The only way
you're getting out of here

1118
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:34,647
is a parachute.

1119
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:38,852
Look... Look,
l took your life from you.

1120
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:41,380
Let me give it back.

1121
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,356
Now get out of here!

1122
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,028
l miss you, brother.

1123
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,229
Next time you get a great idea...

1124
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:57,633
. . .keep it to yourself.

1125
01:17:58,407 --> 01:17:59,374
Now go!

1126
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,814
Sir, l have a track on the plane.
They're returning to base.

1127
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,357
ls the download complete?

1128
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,192
- Yes, sir. We have it all.
- Any word from the pilot?

1129
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,192
Negative.
Pilot has shut down all communications.

1130
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,068
Activate anti-aircraft batteries.

1131
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,106
Target the plane, Perez.

1132
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:37,504
- Sir, it's our plane.
- lt's a rogue plane.

1133
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,676
That's a direct order.
Target it now.

1134
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,440
Put up the satellite.

1135
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:42,915
Satellite's up.

1136
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,955
They're pulling the jet stream
right at us.

1137
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,354
N-9-9-0-7, C-1 7,

1138
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,722
you're diverted to Alexander Airbase.

1139
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,527
Please acknowledge.

1140
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,998
Coming right back at you.

1141
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,245
Open the blast shield.

1142
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,288
l want to see what the hell's going
on out there.

1143
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,459
- lt's coming right at us.
- Wind speed?

1144
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,165
800 miles an hour.

1145
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:41,736
Weapons live.

1146
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:48,546
Fire.

1147
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,553
See you in hell.

1148
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,663
Direct hit, sir. The plane is down.

1149
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,504
l want this base put on
lock-down right away. Get to it.

1150
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:22,273
Sergeant, l want that downloaded
secured, and encrypted ASAP.

1151
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,348
- Yes, sir.
- Sir?

1152
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,152
lt's still coming, sir.

1153
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:37,532
This has turned into a real bad day.

1154
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:51,870
lt's beautiful.

1155
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,617
Shut it down. Shut it all down.

1156
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:09,559
Thor's Hammer never existed.
ls that clear?

1157
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,005
Hello?

1158
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:54,439
Steve?

1159
01:21:56,244 --> 01:22:01,307
Hey, Angel.
How are you doing, baby?

1160
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,048
How do you think l'm doing?
l'm leaving.

1161
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,156
l just called to tell you
l'm leaving my keys in your mailbox.

1162
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,949
No, no, Ange,
please don't do that. Don't.

1163
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,752
How am l supposed to trust you when you
won't even tell me where you are?

1164
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,362
What's that sound?

1165
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,228
- Are you at another airport?
- No, l'm, uh...

1166
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,300
l am definitely not at an airport, but...

1167
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,198
. . .it is a helicopter.

1168
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:32,308
Hang on. Steve, take your right hand
and wave to the helicopter above you.

1169
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,345
Hey, Angel.

1170
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:42,687
Hey, Angel. ls that you, babe?

1171
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,222
We continue with live coverage
from our news helicopter

1172
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,353
that is over what appears to be
the only survivor from a C-1 7 crash.

1173
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,222
Early reports indicate that

1174
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,996
what may have been
a weather weapons test gone out control

1175
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,795
caused the plane to crash and
destroy the military test facility.

1176
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,608
The death toll may be in the hundreds as
we wait for further reports.

1177
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,809
So far, no government sources. . .

1178
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:09,311
- . . .have made any statements...
- Oh, my God. Steve, is that you?

1179
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:12,776
lt's me.
l guess you know where l'm at.

1180
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,219
Where am l?

1181
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:24,663
ln a world
where weather's gone wild,

1182
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,828
only one man has the insight. . .

1183
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:33,306
. . .the talent, the power to forecast
what's coming at you.

1184
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,671

1187
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,107
Cut!

1188
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,176
All right, man, l think we've got it.

1189
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,288

01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,086
- l want to go again.
- Oh, okay. . . / Reset! Going again!

1191

Okay.
Why? What was wrong with it?

1192
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,323
You know, l just want to take
it up a notch. l want to pump it up.

Know what l mean?
l want it to be Richter.

01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,356
l'm going to really go for it
on this one, okay?

1195
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,528
Also. . . if you can get
the camera guy to have

1196
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,464
the crane swoop in a little bit lower.

1197
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:04,237
Maybe. . . he can drop
that crane down a little?

1198
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,098
l've got a better angle over here.

1199
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,605
Cool, all right. Maybe a wider lens
and some more back light.

1200
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:10,743
Now you're talking, dude.
Now you're talking, baby.

1201
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,740
And also, crank that wind machine up.
Crank it up to 1 1 .

01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,280
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. l can handle it.

1203
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,348
You know what? lt's all about
entertainment, baby, right?

1204
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:19,318
- All right.
- We owe it. We're entertainers.

1205
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,318
- Knuckles, come on, baby, knuckles.
- Blow it up?

1206
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,148
Blow it up, baby!

1207

1208
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,394
l've got this idea for a show.

1209
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,823
Oh, well, you've got to talk
to my manager.

1210
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:31,757
Sure. . .

1211
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,529
. . .what did you have in mind?

1212
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:35,665
Well, you know there's all these
stories about how the Chinese

1213
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:38,270
and the Russians have all this
weather modification technology?

1214
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,102
And you got this
Weatherman Gone Wild thing,

1215
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,469
you're a scientist kind of dude.

1216
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,474
l thought you could, like, totally host it.
You'd rock, and you'd be awesome.

1217
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:48,947
Yeah, man, you know, l don't think that's
something l can get behind, dude.

1218
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,445
lt's just not my thing.

1219
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:51,908
We need to work more with nature.

1220
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:53,984
Get more in harmony
with Mother Nature.

1221
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:56,084
That's something l can get behind.

1222
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,121
- What do you think, Ange?
- Absolutely.

1223
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,221
- All right.
- You dig it? You dig it?

1224
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,556
All right, let's shoot this baby!
Come on!

1225
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,428
See, baby?
l told you, you're made for this stuff.

1226
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:09,363
And l was made for you.

1227
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,479
