1
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,043
<i>Are you scared?</i>

2
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,362
<i>Do you remember?</i>

3
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:05,967
<i>The world has made you soft.</i>

4
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,446
<i>In a lifetime a man
plays many parts.</i>

5
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,603
<i>We all hide behind a mask.</i>

6
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:26,003
<i>Do you even know
who you are?</i>

7
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,648
<i>Probably not.</i>

8
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:07,773
Grey, hold on.

9
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:12,092
<i>-Kyle, it 's always the same story.
-What am I supposed to do?</i>

10
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:16,611
-I've got to work this weekend.
- feel like I never see you anymore.

11
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,530
I miss just going to
the beach together.

12
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,289
Six more months and
we'll be back on Louisiana.

13
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,410
Right, until the next
job comes along.

14
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,009
<i>I've got to go.
I'll see you later,okay?</i>

15
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,169
<i>-Hello?
-Hey, baby.</i>

16
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:58,894
Hi.

17
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:03,013
<i>-You okay?
-I'm fine. I'm tired.</i>

18
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,853
Please, drive carefully.

19
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:08,654
<i>Don't worry. I should be
there in ten minutes, okay?</i>

20
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:10,013
Kyle, was I selfish?

21
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:15,092
It 's not easy for you.
No friends, far from home...

22
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:18,531
Kyle?

23
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,335
-Shit!
-I hate it here.

24
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,817
<i>-Baby?
-''Mon amour''!</i>

25
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:53,176
Guess what.
I'm taking a few days off.

26
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:55,576
Just you and me...
and the beach.

27
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:57,575
Promise?

28
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,175
I promise.

29
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,734
Grey, what 's going on?

30
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,574
Oh my God.

31
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,412
<i>Gray?</i>

32
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:30,374
Get off! No!

33
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:34,493
''Milizia''? Can you speak English?
Can you hear me?

34
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:35,934
No!

35
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,658
My wife is in danger! Help!

36
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,895
Move!

37
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:18,618
No!

38
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,257
Grey?

39
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:54,982
Grey?

40
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,426
It 's him!

41
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,824
It 's him!
He killed my wife!

42
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:08,105
Lack of evidence and
gross negligence by the police...

43
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:12,424
give me no choice
but to find Mr. Kovic...

44
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,703
not guilty.

45
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:22,102
-What 's wrong?
-His family has a lot of money.

46
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,748
They bought the judge.
I'm sorry.

47
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:44,343
By taking the life of a man in the
front of this courthouse...

48
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:47,709
you showed no respect for the law.

49
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,309
I regrettably sentence
you to life in prision...

50
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,908
without the chance of parole.

51
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,427
Baby Goat.

52
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,267
Bitch.

53
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:04,632
Stand in line!
Get back.

54
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,150
-You found him!
-Yes, General Hruschov.

55
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,949
-ls he alive?
-Yes.

56
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:23,228
-Bring him over.
-Dima!

57
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,393
Welcome to Kravavi.

58
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:39,550
Shut up!

59
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:47,589
You can try and run if you like.

60
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,988
No one has ever made it alive.

61
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,952
What is your name?

62
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,952
-Billy Cooper.
-How old are you?

63
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,752
Twenty-one.

64
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,712
Too bad.

65
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,351
Carry on.

66
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,910
March!

67
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:56,913
It 's class.

68
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,752
I don't understand.

69
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,595
Don't understand?

70
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:10,357
The ring, ''suka''.

71
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:16,996
This is from my wife.

72
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,319
Billy Cooper.

73
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,278
Kyle Leblanc.

74
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:02,601
What?

75
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,524
-Let 's go!
-Where?

76
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,644
Keep your mouth shut!

77
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,802
Go on! Move!

78
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:20,842
Come on!

79
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:36,844
-I need to see some green tomorrow.
-You'll get it.

80
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,202
Have fun.

81
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,842
Come on, man!

82
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,806
Fuck off!

83
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:03,844
No!

84
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,008
March!

85
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:07,770
Get up!

86
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,608
Now!

87
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,291
Bitch!

88
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,527
Stop!

89
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,213
Little toublemaker, huh?

90
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,449
Stay calm.
Understand?

91
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,540
Kyle, don't kill it!
Let it go!

92
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:28,459
<i>Some people believe
that when you die...</i>

93
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>you return into
another form.</i>

94
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:33,257
<i>What if I was gone?</i>

95
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,457
You'll be in here forever.

96
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:06,814
Shut up.

97
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:14,181
Quiet!

98
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,420
You can make your life easier
for the right price...

99
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,065
understand?

100
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:34,183
451!
We bring you a new cellmate.

101
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:38,502
Better watch out.

102
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,740
He killed his last three cellmates...

103
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:44,941
but if you want to change cells...

104
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,140
you let me know.

105
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,467
Move!
Back to work!

106
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:36,028
Grey's already back in Louisiana.

107
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:41,507
Like you asked me.
Found a place, close to the water.

108
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:43,394
Surrounded by trees.

109
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:47,553
Thanks, Paul. Your sister
should rest in peace.

110
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,032
How is it in here?

111
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:54,630
Kyle, this is Russia.
You can pay them off.

112
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,750
-Can't you control your animals?
-Get you pussy away from my man.

113
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:32,430
Stay back!

114
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,033
We have problem here?

115
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:43,433
Not now!

116
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:46,233
You want fight?

117
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,712
Go to Sparka.
Understand?

118
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,470
Move.

119
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:10,115
That was scary, dude.

120
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:12,394
-Kyle.
-Hey, I'm Billy.

121
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,873
What are you in for?

122
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:20,672
Tryin' to figure that out.
I was travellin' around...

123
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:24,798
everyhting was great.
Then I met this girl and...

124
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:26,717
we were drinking and...

125
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:29,676
she crashed her
car into a restaurant.

126
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:34,195
So they charged me
with gross negligence...

127
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:37,555
to private property.
Got a fucking year and a half.

128
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,233
How ya doin'?
Malakai.

129
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,073
Kyle.

130
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:50,678
I Have seen you Man in the Newspaper.You killed the
fuckin' guy right outside the courtroom.

131
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,237
Good for you, man.
He deserved it.

132
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:58,836
The guy who threw
the ball at me. Who is he?

133
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:02,196
Andrei.

134
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,555
Russian mafia.
The guy next to him is their leader.

135
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:12,274
Bolt. They got a deal with the
guards. They run the place.

136
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:15,319
The rest of the gangs just
try to kill each other.

137
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,879
It 's a regular party.

138
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:22,917
The whole place is a fuckin'
war zone. lnside and out.

139
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:27,237
Listen, man, anything you need...

140
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:29,156
I'm the man to see.

141
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,434
Okay?

142
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:33,556
But this one I'll
give you for free.

143
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:40,840
Pay the guard
and get yourself out...

144
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,278
of that crazy motherfucker
nigger cell.

145
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,239
Better start prayin', okay?

146
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,758
Don't ever touch me again!

147
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:56,043
The world's got
too much noise.

148
00:31:56,322 --> 00:32:00,523
And I've earned my peace and quiet,
and I expect it.

149
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,723
You only got 18 months so let them
do what they want and get outta here.

150
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,243
-How long you been in here?
-Six years.

151
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:28,083
But I'm gonna get outta here.
This place ain't shit.

152
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,721
He thinks he's a tough guy.
He's nothing but a small time.

153
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:35,442
You wanna climb the wall?
Quit puttin' that shit in your arm.

154
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:36,881
You sell it to me.

155
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,359
I been sellin' shit
my whole life. It 's my job.

156
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,407
I gotta roll before my wheels
get stuck in this bullshit.

157
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:47,804
He's a little bitter and all,
being a gimp!

158
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,724
You're tough.
I like that.

159
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:17,446
I'll see you tonight.

160
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,286
I want to change cells.

161
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:45,566
America.

162
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:47,684
Expensive.

163
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:52,563
I'll call for more money.

164
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,243
Until then, we wait.

165
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:27,369
What is this?

166
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,810
The inmates have problems.
This is the solution.

167
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,528
Back home we have football.
Here it 's the Sparka.

168
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:37,726
The guards set up the fights.
General Hruschov makes money...

169
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:41,566
bettin' with his pig friends
and everybody's happy.

170
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:45,406
Except the poor schmuck who
gets his head bashed in.

171
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:48,371
Motherfuckers, am I late?
I'll take all your action.

172
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,130
I'll bet you two packs on Andrei.

173
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,929
Step back.

174
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:06,126
Ladies and gentlemen,
on the right...

175
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,727
is the one that is always after me.

176
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:11,285
On the left is the one
that 's always after him.

177
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:14,651
I've always dreamed of having
them both together.

178
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:18,770
Well, I finally do!
I am stuck in the middle!

179
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:27,969
Now they will break my heart!
They'll hurt each other.

180
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:36,808
It 's time for blood,
sweat, tears! Boys...

181
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:40,932
show me how you love me!
Go, fuck yourselves!

182
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:02,654
Jesus!

183
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:12,532
Stop!

184
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:32,974
Does he fight?

185
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:36,492
He refused.
One reason he's still alive...

186
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:40,253
the guards make a lotta money
puttin' inmates in his cell.

187
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:43,299
Just gets rid of those
they don't like.

188
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:07,174
-Stay away from me!
-Drop it.

189
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:09,580
Drop it!

190
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:21,375
Take him to infirmary.

191
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,455
Hey, ''suka'', you're in my way.

192
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:31,054
Sorry.

193
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,458
-What 's the point?
-I want no trouble.

194
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:42,978
He disrespected us.

195
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,579
Get your respect.

196
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:24,583
Stop!

197
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,861
Not necessary.

198
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,859
I hope everything's resolved.

199
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:59,502
This is not America.
Don't be hero.

200
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:02,660
Take him back to the hole.

201
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,939
Everybody back to work!

202
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:43,703
<i>Grey.</i>

203
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:17,663
Long time no see.

204
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:21,703
Who are you?

205
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:32,747
<i>...seven foot, a hundred
and thlrty kllos. Mllos...</i>

206
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:40,065
Your break is over.
Let 's go.

207
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:12,951
I'm going to make you
my favorite ''suka''.

208
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,909
We're going to take turns.

209
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:21,948
Don't start,
or I'll put you both in hole!

210
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,947
You're dead.

211
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,472
Ready?

212
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,510
What 's up, man?
You okay?

213
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:20,270
Gotta go.

214
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,188
Come on, man!

215
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:52,995
<i>''Hate gives me strength.
Even when there's no hope.</i>

216
00:44:54,914 --> 00:44:57,954
<i>Tomorrow it's the time.
Hate'll makes things right.</i>

217
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:02,473
<i>Shit, hate keeps me alive.''</i>

218
00:45:40,158 --> 00:45:41,517
Nice to see you again.

219
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:53,794
I'll see you tonight.

220
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:11,237
Where the fuck's he goin'?

221
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:18,435
What?

222
00:46:49,395 --> 00:46:50,756
Stop!

223
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:54,960
You American.

224
00:46:55,281 --> 00:46:58,719
You are going inside for long,
long time.

225
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,957
<i>When shit hits the fan,
we all look for God...</i>

226
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:11,197
<i>but by then it's usually too late.</i>

227
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,719
<i>When He doesn't show up...</i>

228
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:33,159
<i>it's up to you to deal with
your own miserable life.</i>

229
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:43,683
What is it?

230
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:46,282
-We hit a mine.
-Stay back!

231
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:52,441
Stop them.

232
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:13,163
Go, go! Come on!

233
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,642
Escape!

234
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:18,122
Line up!

235
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:21,001
Check out!

236
00:48:37,404 --> 00:48:40,963
<i>We all have our way of dealin'.
Some choose to run.</i>

237
00:48:42,283 --> 00:48:44,321
<i>Others stay and fight.</i>

238
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:30,046
We lost money because you...
two hours late.

239
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:49,448
I should throw you in the hole.
I give you chance.

240
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:53,167
You're more useful to me
as a bitch, understand?

241
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:55,486
Take him.

242
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:06,964
Please! No!

243
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,125
<i>Is it a sin when you
reach your limit?</i>

244
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:36,324
<i>When you've taken
your last steps.</i>

245
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,930
<i>When you can go no more.</i>

246
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:50,528
<i>You find that dark
place deep inside.</i>

247
00:50:51,766 --> 00:50:53,966
<i>Forget the world
you come from.</i>

248
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:56,966
<i>Embrace the world you're in.</i>

249
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:13,849
He's ready for the Sparka.

250
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,809
I love you.
And I love you all!

251
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,727
-Kick his ass.
-Place your bets!

252
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:50,648
Hold on to your panties,
the party is about to begin!

253
00:51:55,172 --> 00:51:57,293
I give you twenty to one on Andrei.

254
00:51:57,293 --> 00:51:59,372
No way this American can win.

255
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:10,175
Beat the shit out of him!

256
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:19,653
Come on!

257
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:29,932
Come on!

258
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:57,052
Come on, Kyle!

259
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,542
Feels good...

260
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:42,941
doesn't it?

261
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:39,901
Your American is very, very good.

262
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:42,022
Bring the best men
from your prison.

263
00:56:42,022 --> 00:56:44,701
I'll give you a chance to
win back your money.

264
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:26,545
Finish him.

265
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:28,344
Finish him!

266
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:54,345
<i>You think you're a winner.</i>

267
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,743
<i>When you bend to play their
game, you're a loser.</i>

268
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,263
<i>You lost yourself.</i>

269
00:58:08,827 --> 00:58:10,747
He's really fucked up.

270
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,510
What are you looking at?

271
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:39,988
Do you even know who you are?

272
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:43,746
Probably not.

273
00:58:53,426 --> 00:58:54,466
Christ!

274
00:58:55,705 --> 00:58:57,264
I'm sorry.

275
00:58:57,949 --> 00:58:59,671
Must be tough in here.

276
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,951
Everything's gettin better.

277
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,350
I spoke to the Ambassador.

278
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:07,149
-He's gonna talk to the...
-Forget it!

279
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:08,948
What?

280
00:59:09,548 --> 00:59:11,347
Don't give me hope.

281
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:14,227
Nothing will change.

282
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:17,107
Forget me.

283
00:59:44,628 --> 00:59:46,828
Bolt cutters are where
they supposed to be.

284
01:00:11,988 --> 01:00:13,713
You didn't learn from last time?

285
01:00:13,993 --> 01:00:16,192
I'd rather die than play the bitch.

286
01:00:16,473 --> 01:00:19,072
Happy Russian Independence Day.
Send you a postcard.

287
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:37,269
So you are the American.
I am Valya.

288
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,553
Valya!

289
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:50,832
Warden told us no trouble today.

290
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,391
Come on.

291
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:06,154
That 's the guy they transferred
from the other jail to fight you.

292
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,672
Russian Independence Day
is a celebration of liberation.

293
01:01:16,032 --> 01:01:18,912
Pull up your skirt.
Here comes a sea of shit.

294
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:22,272
As a family with one common goal...

295
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:26,190
the rehabilitation of ourselves
and... our communities.

296
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:54,318
Kravavi will be reborn.
Together...

297
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:57,197
we will rise to new heights.
Together...

298
01:01:57,197 --> 01:01:59,676
we will embrace our future!

299
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:02,475
Future!

300
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:08,514
<i>The volce of authority should
be the voice of reason.</i>

301
01:02:08,874 --> 01:02:11,554
<i>Supposed to set examples, teach us.</i>

302
01:02:11,954 --> 01:02:14,073
<i>And I have learned is all just...</i>

303
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:16,273
<i>bullshit to keep us down.</i>

304
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,556
There is no escape.

305
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:42,274
I don't want to ruin
you pretty face.

306
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:46,679
But you just got more
time added on.

307
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,478
How long, is up to me.
Serve your time.

308
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:53,957
My little bitch.

309
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,479
Your payment.

310
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:18,798
How's Billy?

311
01:03:19,279 --> 01:03:22,238
Go easy on him.
It 's just a kid.

312
01:03:34,322 --> 01:03:39,040
<i>Malakai set Billy up. I guess
everybody has their price.</i>

313
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,120
Get out!

314
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:02,522
<i>After a while you don't
feel the steady prick.</i>

315
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:07,602
<i>You grow numb to it.
Forget about...</i>

316
01:04:07,602 --> 01:04:12,881
<i>what was, worry about
what is. But no...</i>

317
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,959
<i>not me. I can't forget.
I can't forgive.</i>

318
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:07,562
Get out.

319
01:05:13,124 --> 01:05:14,965
Take him to infirmary.

320
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:30,003
He tried to make me kiss him.

321
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:31,843
I spit in his face.

322
01:05:34,322 --> 01:05:37,683
He couldn't break me.

323
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,606
Kyle...

324
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:46,125
don't let them turn you into
something you're not.

325
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:12,406
<i>He finally escaped...</i>

326
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:14,605
<i>but in a different way.</i>

327
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:47,885
Ladies and gentlemen...

328
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:01,688
What 's he doin'?

329
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:12,607
Get up!

330
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:14,526
Fight!

331
01:07:19,131 --> 01:07:21,050
-Fight!
-Fight!

332
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:50,490
Get up!

333
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,731
Fight!

334
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:03,567
Tolik, what the hell is going on?

335
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:06,047
<i>-I don't know, sir.
-Well, find out.</i>

336
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:11,533
You better fight or
suffer consequences.

337
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:14,572
I won't play your game anymore.

338
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,852
He won't fight, general.

339
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,051
Get him out of there and
start another fight.

340
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:22,931
<i>-We'll deal with him later.
-Yes, sir.</i>

341
01:08:44,611 --> 01:08:46,891
Let me know when
you're ready to fight.

342
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:37,933
Who's that for?

343
01:09:38,693 --> 01:09:40,133
It 's for you.

344
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:43,853
From Billy.

345
01:09:56,895 --> 01:10:01,134
How could you betray your friend?
You got a big mouth.

346
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:03,534
Look at me.

347
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:06,973
I said look at me!

348
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:09,172
Even if I get out of this place...

349
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:12,735
I'm in a goddamn chair
for the rest of my life!

350
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:17,338
I piss, I shit all over myself.
I got sores all over my body.

351
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,457
I need special things.

352
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:21,377
They told me...

353
01:10:21,656 --> 01:10:24,536
they promised me, if I get my
eyes and my ears opened...

354
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:25,976
they would take care of me.

355
01:10:26,735 --> 01:10:29,134
I didn't want them
to kill Billy.

356
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:31,814
I swear to God, man.

357
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:33,934
I'm just tryin' to survive.

358
01:10:45,737 --> 01:10:49,377
I gotta get outta this
fuckin' place. Please...

359
01:10:49,858 --> 01:10:51,096
help me.

360
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:08,940
<i>I've been here over half my life.
I try to forget how I get here.</i>

361
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,219
''...and took a great delight,
it did it like...''

362
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:18,257
<i>When you're a kid you want to
believe what grown ups tell you.</i>

363
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,258
<i>What's right.</i>

364
01:11:20,258 --> 01:11:21,777
<i>What's wrong.</i>

365
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:26,855
Perfection.

366
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:31,940
<i>The stroking, the pettig,
all the lis of...</i>

367
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:36,660
<i>love and concern.
I finally realized...</i>

368
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:40,859
<i>the temperature was four
hundred and fifty one degrees.</i>

369
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:44,898
<i>It was all a dirty shame.</i>

370
01:11:45,778 --> 01:11:49,217
<i>Like my burn mark.
It stays forever.</i>

371
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:12,899
Your American, he has heart.

372
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:15,498
He's a idiot.
He should've fought.

373
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:18,863
He's fighting.

374
01:12:19,263 --> 01:12:20,583
For himself.

375
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:32,461
-What do you want?
-Peace.

376
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,540
Bullshit.

377
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:39,780
Take a good look.

378
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,224
-He is a dead man.
-With his death...

379
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:49,063
only he wins.

380
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:54,542
Together, we could all win.

381
01:12:55,862 --> 01:12:57,981
I want the fight. Now!

382
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,859
Victor!

383
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:15,264
Bring me Valya.

384
01:13:16,584 --> 01:13:17,944
That is suicide.

385
01:13:18,223 --> 01:13:21,502
The others gangs are united.
We cannot fight them all.

386
01:13:26,942 --> 01:13:28,981
No one will fight.

387
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,826
<i>Unity of people can bring
down any system.</i>

388
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:39,345
<i>Their power was gone.
They couldn't punish everyone.</i>

389
01:14:14,504 --> 01:14:18,063
-Where have you been?
-When you forgot yourself...

390
01:14:18,462 --> 01:14:20,183
you forgot me.

391
01:14:23,066 --> 01:14:26,308
-You've lost everything.
-Grey...

392
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:31,786
In my opinion...

393
01:14:31,786 --> 01:14:33,906
we bring him to the fields
and shoot him.

394
01:14:33,906 --> 01:14:36,786
If we kill him we turn
him into a martyr.

395
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:43,664
We must destroy his mystique
in front of everyone once and for all.

396
01:14:55,108 --> 01:14:56,627
Keep your faith.

397
01:14:58,547 --> 01:14:59,787
<i>Without evil...</i>

398
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:02,948
<i>we would never
recognize the good.</i>

399
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:15,150
Grey...

400
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:16,669
You're back.

401
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:19,750
You made me so happy.

402
01:15:20,589 --> 01:15:23,867
-I miss you.
-Nobody has ever gone...

403
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:26,268
as long as there's someone
to remember them.

404
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:55,428
It 's your time.

405
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:04,032
Lately we are having a huge
problem in Kravavi.

406
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:07,112
Authority is being
challenged.

407
01:16:07,112 --> 01:16:11,151
Order is not being respected.
This is unforgivable.

408
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:14,390
Tonight, I will show
you the consequences...

409
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:16,309
of this kind of
disobedience!

410
01:16:23,508 --> 01:16:25,707
All I want is one fight.

411
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:27,912
I will get it.

412
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:31,473
Meet Milos.

413
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:19,836
Continue to fight.

414
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:23,034
Kill me!

415
01:18:24,954 --> 01:18:26,393
I won't fight anymore.

416
01:18:44,996 --> 01:18:46,916
Do it! Come on shoot me!

417
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:07,684
People say one thing but they do
another. It 's all just bullshit.

418
01:21:09,043 --> 01:21:11,803
Everyone I killed in here
talked too much.

419
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,041
Don't waste words.

420
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:19,001
Just best not
to say a thing.

421
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:21,521
Look here, shut up.

422
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,366
Gotta get out of here.

423
01:21:31,004 --> 01:21:32,445
Someone killed my wife.

424
01:21:33,964 --> 01:21:36,764
I became a beast.
I lost myself.

425
01:21:37,804 --> 01:21:39,324
I lost her too.

426
01:21:40,204 --> 01:21:42,124
I don't want to
lose her again.

427
01:21:44,522 --> 01:21:46,362
I can get you out.

428
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,004
I have every death and every
murder that 's happened in here...

429
01:22:04,004 --> 01:22:07,045
for the last twenty some years.

430
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,524
Somebody out there
has to care.

431
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:13,562
You need more fight.

432
01:22:18,687 --> 01:22:19,727
After the fight...

433
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:22,687
they'll take you to a field and
shoot you. That 's their plan.

434
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:27,567
-I won't fight anymore.
-My plan calls for one last fight.

435
01:22:39,284 --> 01:22:42,163
<i>Seven inmates and one
guard died that night.</i>

436
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,529
<i>It was the first time since
I can remember...</i>

437
01:22:45,529 --> 01:22:48,407
<i>that we weren't
fighting each other.</i>

438
01:22:50,128 --> 01:22:53,487
<i>We were under total lock-down
for two weeks.</i>

439
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:03,645
I have to fight one more time,
so we can get out of here...

440
01:23:04,684 --> 01:23:07,284
...together.
-If he fights...

441
01:23:07,685 --> 01:23:09,490
he's no longer a martyr.

442
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,209
Win or lose, get rid of him.

443
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:11,570
This is for Billy.

444
01:25:44,774 --> 01:25:46,014
Good luck.

445
01:25:52,654 --> 01:25:54,173
Put him in the back.

446
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:30,339
Open up.
Come on.

447
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,534
You're making big mistake.

448
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,819
Sorry for the mistake.

449
01:27:05,258 --> 01:27:06,496
Here. Put this on.

450
01:27:07,337 --> 01:27:08,415
Damn!

451
01:27:12,336 --> 01:27:14,055
This is General Eltzin's car.

452
01:27:14,736 --> 01:27:17,414
You drive right through the gate.
Nobody's gonna stop you.

453
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,059
-You're coming with me, right?
-No.

454
01:27:23,059 --> 01:27:26,819
This is my home.
You got your part, I got mine.

455
01:27:34,778 --> 01:27:36,616
Make sure people know.

456
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:42,175
Come on. Get outta here. Go.

457
01:28:11,982 --> 01:28:14,982
Next time,
I'm gonna get my money back.

458
01:28:14,982 --> 01:28:17,060
I'm looking forward to it.

459
01:28:30,897 --> 01:28:33,462
-General...
-You're not allowed in here!

460
01:28:40,102 --> 01:28:41,541
Get out!

461
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:43,741
You talk too much.

462
01:28:58,423 --> 01:28:59,865
<i>Hello?</i>

463
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:02,543
<i>What did you say
about the general?</i>

464
01:29:02,824 --> 01:29:05,024
<i>Hello? Who is it?</i>

465
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:23,905
We did it...

466
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,665
together.

467
01:29:28,224 --> 01:29:32,745
<i>Most of us know the mask
we hide behind is bullshit.</i>

468
01:29:33,623 --> 01:29:35,822
<i>Sooner or later it shatters.</i>

469
01:29:36,664 --> 01:29:40,022
<i>That's when you find out
the man you really are.</i>
