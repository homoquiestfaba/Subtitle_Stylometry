1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am black and beautiful.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
O daughters of Jerusalem,

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do not gaze at me
because I am dark.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your lips are like
crimson thread,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
your breasts are like two fawns
that feed among the lilies.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There is no flaw in you.

8
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:12,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

9
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,505
Adonijah!
Adonijah, my brother!

10
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,544
Are you hurt?

11
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,922
Oh, of course not,
Solomon.

12
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,997
I always end a race this way.

13
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,302
No, don't move.
Let me see if you are injured.

14
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:30,957
So, you're
a physician now, too?

15
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,752
Is there anything
you don't know, Solomon?

16
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,671
I know you're too mean to be hurt
by such a minor accident.

17
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,941
Minor accident ?

18
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,466
- It was spectacular.
- I thought you'd been killed.

19
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:43,258
Imagine my disappointment now,
to see you still alive.

20
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,012
Get away from me!

21
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm not hurt.

22
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:50,529
I won, Solomon.

23
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,593
Won? You have to cross
the finish line to win.

24
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:58,246
Look at you. . .
you can't even walk.

25
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,205
I can walk.

26
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:08,336
Pick him up,
pick him up!

27
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:09,845
Break camp!

28
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,530
The hunt is over.
To Jerusalem!

29
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:21,735
Are you in need
of help?

30
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,493
Only if you're
a physician.

31
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,703
Physician?

32
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,263
No, no, my lord!
Stop, stop, stop.

33
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,068
But my daughter
is skilled in herbs.

34
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:35,148
Many people say
she has healed them.

35
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,454
What is your name?

36
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:40,889
I am Azarel ben Asaph,
from Jaffa.

37
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,706
I travel to Jerusalem
to sell salt fish.

38
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:48,184
This is my daughter,
if we can be of any help, my lord.

39
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,584
What is her name?

40
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,916
She is called Abishag.

41
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,991
And she has healing powers,
you say?

42
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,849
She has healed many
in my village, my lord.

43
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:02,732
I am Solomon,
son of King David.

44
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,680
This is my half brother,
also King David's son.

45
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,982
If you help him, there will be
a handsome reward, I assure you.

46
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:12,309
To aid the son of our great king
is reward enough, my lord.

47
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,513
There is an oasis just there.

48
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:17,718
We'll test your daughter's
healing powers.

49
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,322
Why the fish themselves
do not get sick,

50
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,325
is a great mystery
to me, my lord!

51
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,019
Ah, ah. . .
do not worry, my lord.

52
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:41,770
Abishag will help
your brother.

53
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:44,744
My wife offers you
salt fish.

54
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,608
This is my business.
Here--

55
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,394
try it--
I think you will find it pleasing.

56
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:53,882
Mmm. . .
this is good, Azarel.

57
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:56,347
But how can you fish
if you can't abide boats?

58
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:59,317
No, I do not fish myself, my lord.
Never.

59
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,632
I buy from the boats
as they come in the evening.

60
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,742
We work through the night
to salt the fish.

61
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,888
Through the night?

62
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:12,384
The heat of the day. . .
they must be fresh.

63
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:14,979
Solomon!

64
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,508
Adonijah!

65
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,836
Are you all right?
Your wounds!?

66
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:22,954
Nearly painless. . .

67
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:25,842
Would that I had been
injured before. . .

68
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,727
were I to be touched
by this woman.

69
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:31,892
Abishag, come out.

70
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:37,050
Have you ever seen
such a creature?

71
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:39,970
And her hands,
they are touched by God.

72
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,174
She heals just by. . .
laying on.

73
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,044
Perhaps you'd like
to meet her father. . .?

74
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:48,673
Azarel ben Asaph
from Jaffa,

75
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,301
meet the recently revived
Adonijah from Jerusalem,

76
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,611
the son of King David
and Haggith.

77
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,949
Sir, I'd like to buy
your daughter.

78
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,779
She's not for sale,
my lord.

79
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:03,156
Then I'd like
to marry her.

80
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:04,565
No, my lord.

81
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:06,641
Hah-- you?!
Married?!

82
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,297
( vendors chattering )

83
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,139
May the King live forever.
Your blessing, Father.

84
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,206
Lord bless you
and keep you.

85
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,952
God make His face to shine upon you
and be gracious to you.

86
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,869
God lift up His countenance to you
and give you peace.

87
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,413
So, the hunt went well?

88
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:12,009
No, Father.
No game was seen.

89
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:14,988
Oh. . . so, no tales
to tell, then.

90
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,951
Oh, a tale of near death
to tell.

91
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:17,910
Wha. . .?

92
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,378
But without the hunt?

93
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,331
Adonijah challenged me
to a race.

94
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,089
An accident?

95
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,429
He was thrown from his chariot
when it overturned.

96
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,385
Is he injured?

97
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:31,168
That's the most interesting part.
He was hurt, badly.

98
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:32,611
He was cut, broken,
he passed out. . .

99
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,362
as we were rushing him
here to the court physicians,

100
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:38,947
but on the way, we met
an old merchant and his family.

101
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:41,606
( mimicking )  A dealer
in salt fish, O Illustrious One.

102
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,134
Though never have I set foot
on a boat myself.

103
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,755
The motion, Great One,
it brings on the sickness.

104
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,895
Why the fish themselves are not sick
is a mystery to me, my lord.

105
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,733
But then his daughter,
a great beauty,

106
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,353
took Adonijah into their tent
and within an hour,

107
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:06,492
he was nearly whole.
An amazing cure.

108
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:07,970
How?

109
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,175
Herbs, and a knowledge
of nature, she says.

110
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,392
Bring her to me, Solomon.

111
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,185
Perhaps she can do something
with this old body.

112
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,801
I will.

113
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,622
Solomon!

114
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,696
Solomon, let me approach her.

115
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:35,001
- Who?
- The girl you promised to our father.

116
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,098
- You were listening?
- I must have her, let me bring her.

117
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,952
- The king commanded me. . .
- A favor, I beg of you.

118
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,808
Solomon. . .?

119
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,693
- Yes, all right.
- Thank you, Solomon.

120
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:56,135
Acknowledge them.
It is you they are cheering.

121
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,412
Is it wise to be seen
riding together, Joab?

122
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,450
What could be more natural?
You take an interest in the army,

123
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:03,598
so you ride with
the general in command.

124
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:07,312
- But much more important. . .
- Yes?

125
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,649
it shows the army is behind you.
Solomon's a weakling.

126
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,473
You speak harshly of my brother?

127
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:15,031
Half brother.
With him on the throne,

128
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:17,691
this country will fall apart
within five years.

129
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,356
Or Bathsheba would rule.

130
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,283
Solomon's mother is not as strong
as she would like to think.

131
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,937
- Stronger than her son.
- So is my eunuch.

132
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,558
Bathsheba doesn't understand
that Israel's strength. . .

133
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:29,482
lies in her fighting men.
You do,

134
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,239
so the army's behind you.

135
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,969
Look at the people.
They love you.

136
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,462
You are the image
of what a prince should be.

137
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,906
And when the time comes,
and I think it will not be long,

138
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:40,876
we must strike.
Then, the throne of Israel is yours.

139
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:46,034
Now, where do we find
this young woman you lust after?

140
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:49,437
You wait till you see her.

141
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,860
Make way!

142
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,927
Come on! Come on!

143
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:10,375
I'm Joab, general in charge
of the armed forces of Israel.

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,298
You are commanded to present
yourself and your daughter

145
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:15,218
at the court of King David.

146
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,861
Arise. . .

147
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,238
you are in no danger.

148
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:56,206
I am Bathsheba, wife of King David,
mother of Solomon.

149
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:59,249
He tells me your daughter
heals wounds.

150
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,265
Is that true?

151
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,440
It is quite true,
my queen.

152
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,334
I'm not a queen.

153
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:10,298
He flatters me because he thinks
it will be to his benefit.

154
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:15,363
What's your name?

155
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:21,965
He's Azarel ben Asaph of Jaffa,
a seller of salt fish.

156
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:24,650
And this is his daughter,
Abishag.

157
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:26,959
Come here, child.

158
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:35,386
You're beautiful.

159
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:38,136
So, you're skilled in herbs?

160
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,694
I have some knowledge,
Majesty.

161
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,796
It is our wish that your daughter
remains here to nurse the king.

162
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:50,470
General Joab,

163
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,610
I'm thankful
for your interest. . .

164
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:55,137
in bringing
this girl here.

165
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:58,283
You may go now.

166
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,223
As you wish.

167
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:08,110
You may all go.

168
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:18,235
Azarel, come here.

169
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,748
What I am about to tell you
is vital information,

170
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,050
worth much
to the king's enemies.

171
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,478
You love the king?

172
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,614
Israel exists only because
of King David,

173
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,922
for God loves him.

174
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:37,708
The king's life
is drawing to its close.

175
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,949
Israel is divided,

176
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:41,541
and only King David
can bring us all together.

177
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:47,274
That's why I want your daughter
to use all her power. . .

178
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:50,228
to bring back
the health of King David.

179
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:54,256
And I promise that
when she will leave,

180
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,040
she will take with her
a dowry fit for a queen,

181
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,860
and she will be
as pure as she is today.

182
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,989
It shall be as you wish.

183
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,465
Good.

184
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:09,632
So, my dear, we'll prepare you
to meet the king.

185
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,300
David is dying.

186
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,896
Our king is dying.

187
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,042
He will not survive.

188
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:53,287
And when he dies. . .

189
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:55,430
who are they going to put
on the throne?

190
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:57,325
- Solomon.
- Solomon!

191
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,208
And you know as well as I do,
our kingdom will be lost

192
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,927
- with him on the throne.
- That's treason you're talking!

193
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,207
Treason?!

194
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,574
It's our duty
to consider the succession.

195
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:10,326
But it is the king's will
that Solomon succeed him.

196
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,731
But is it God's will,
Abiathar?

197
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,898
Joab, God's will
and King David's will

198
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,977
are one and the same.

199
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:21,118
Is it God's will that His kingdom
be governed by a weak man,

200
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,973
without ambition
for himself or his people?

201
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,846
Of course, as priests,

202
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:33,960
I look to you for guidance
in these matters.

203
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:36,106
And the army?

204
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,344
Well, naturally,
they'll follow your lead.

205
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,480
And yours, General Joab.

206
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,756
Adonijah should. . .

207
00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:46,714
must be our new king.

208
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,582
But he cannot,
will not, unless you. . .

209
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,072
his newly elected High Priest,
anoint him.

210
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,903
High Priest?

211
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,914
Of course.

212
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:00,194
Let me explain.

213
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:01,857
It is essential. . .

214
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,969
that Adonijah be crowned
before David dies. . .

215
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,893
Abishag.

216
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,075
Well, come closer.
Come closer!

217
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,542
There's no need to fear me.

218
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:31,706
Oh, she makes me wish
I were young again.

219
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:34,661
But then, my dearest,

220
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:36,865
so do you.

221
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,642
Do you sing, child?

222
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:44,359
A little, my Lord King.

223
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,886
Play for your king.

224
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:57,584
( plays gently )

225
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:24,680
All is prepared for tomorrow
at the Stone Zoheleth, near Enrogel.

226
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,099
I'll send a company there with food
and wine enough to feast a thousand.

227
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,385
And the priests?

228
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,586
Abiathar is riding there
even now.

229
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,636
It has come to pass.

230
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,838
I n the morning, I'll spread the word
through the marketplace.

231
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:48,188
This time tomorrow, Adonijah,
you will be King of Israel.

232
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,411
Long live the King.

233
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,248
- Joab?
- My lord?

234
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:09,867
Oh, Joab, come,
come here.

235
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,362
You summoned me, my lord?

236
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:15,504
I'm troubled, Joab.

237
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,712
By what?

238
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,154
Memories.

239
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,840
Memories trouble old men.

240
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:29,219
Your memories should be
of battles won for God,

241
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:32,385
kingdoms established
in His name.

242
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,878
God's own words
trouble me, Joab.

243
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:41,358
Now therefore the sword shall
never depart from this house.

244
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:43,344
Do you remember those words?

245
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:46,760
Yes.
But that was a long time ago.

246
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:50,286
You remember the rest
of what God said to me?

247
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:51,799
No.

248
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,199
You were there, with me.

249
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,932
So I will raise up troubles
against you,

250
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,244
within your own house,
He said.

251
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:04,129
Within your own house.

252
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:10,851
Because of our conspiracy,
Joab.

253
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:14,885
- That was a long time ago.
- Well. . .

254
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:17,194
You paid a dear price.

255
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:22,700
- Your firstborn died.
- Bathsheba's. . .

256
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:25,773
but I gave her another child. . .
Solomon.

257
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,726
Yes, of course.

258
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:32,537
He will reign when I die,
of course.

259
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,842
Of course.

260
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,049
It is God's will.

261
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,095
Of course.

262
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:40,730
God's will. . .

263
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,579
Of course.

264
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,392
Please-- close it!
Close!

265
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:14,042
Close up! Close!
Close up!

266
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:15,516
Close.

267
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:16,928
Close up.

268
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,252
- Hey, what's going on?
- Haven't you heard?

269
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:18,783
They are anointing
the new king,

270
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:21,794
at the Stone Zoheleth.
Food and drink for everyone.

271
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,139
- New king?
- Adonijah.

272
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,385
- Adonijah?!
- Adonijah!

273
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,661
- But, Solomon. . .?
- Adonijah, I said!

274
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:30,415
Long live the king!
Don't you agree?

275
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:31,859
Long live the king.

276
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,375
Close up! Close!
Close! Close up!

277
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,336
Long live the king.

278
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,345
Close!

279
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,242
Close it! Close up!

280
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:57,724
- What do you have to report?
- You will be shocked to learn.

281
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,648
At the Stone Zoheleth,
this very moment,

282
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,236
Adonijah is being anointed king.

283
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,098
Abiathar and Joab anoint him.

284
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:06,240
- Thank you. God bless you.
- God go with you.

285
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:13,161
One who was there
has just ridden to tell me.

286
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:14,124
Mother. . .?

287
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:17,903
They are preparing
to anoint Adonijah king.

288
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,083
What?

289
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,798
- Who?
- Joab. The army.

290
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:27,160
At the altar of Stone Zoheleth.
One who was there just told me.

291
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:29,332
- And King David?
- He knows nothing about it.

292
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,030
They know
he is too weak.

293
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,651
I would never think
they'd dare.

294
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:36,642
You must see the king
at once.

295
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:40,449
Put the palace guard
on full alert.

296
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,373
Our lives are in danger!

297
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,164
Our lives?

298
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,372
Father will annul it.
Just because Adonijah. . .

299
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,648
Oh, Solomon!
Stop being so naive!

300
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,244
They'll cease at nothing!

301
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,128
They have nearly got
the kingdom in their grasp.

302
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,399
But not while I am alive.

303
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,732
You're going to be king
in spite of yourself.

304
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,696
Try to be a man!

305
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,593
More. . .

306
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:18,597
May the King live forever.

307
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:23,977
So formal, my love.

308
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:27,822
Why?
What is it now?

309
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,360
It was always
your promise to me. . .

310
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:35,438
that Solomon would be
king in your place?

311
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,813
Yes, I made that vow.

312
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:41,716
Well, today
your son Adonijah. . .

313
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,336
is to be anointed
to be King of Israel.

314
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,295
What?

315
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:49,216
By whose authority?

316
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:52,480
With the support of the army,
and much of the priesthood.

317
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:54,981
Joab?

318
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,324
Even so.

319
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:03,502
Joab-- Joab has
been loyal for 0 years!

320
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,870
He betrays you at this moment.

321
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:07,858
Nathan?
Come closer!

322
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,693
Is-- is this all true?

323
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:12,879
It is, my lord.

324
00:25:12,982 --> 00:25:16,302
He is to make sacrifices and
Abiathar will pour the holy oil.

325
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,315
They are travelling to the altar
of Stone Zoheleth at this moment.

326
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,253
The eyes of Israel are on you
to tell them who shall be their king.

327
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,046
I am their king.

328
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:31,555
And as I swore to you
by the Lord, the God of Israel,

329
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,472
that your son Solomon
shall succeed me as king,

330
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,612
so shall I swear today.

331
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:43,662
Zadok?
Does he remain loyal?

332
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:45,706
He does,
and many other priests.

333
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,187
And the palace guard.

334
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,464
Good.

335
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,851
Nathan, take Zadok. . .

336
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:55,706
and the other
loyal priests. . .

337
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,978
and the palace guard.

338
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,660
Have Solomon ride on a donkey
from my stables,

339
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:05,562
not a horse, on my donkey,
and bring him down to Gihon.

340
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,660
And there let Zadok
anoint him king over all Israel.

341
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,487
This is my will.

342
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:26,192
My king.

343
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,545
( trumpets heralding )

344
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:33,118
( horn blowing )

345
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:56,122
( cheering )

346
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:18,470
You are a witness to history,
my wife.

347
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,998
Today God decides
who is to lead His people.

348
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:23,824
Two men now claiming
the throne, but I for one,

349
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:26,292
will follow the choice
of King David.

350
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:34,716
( cheering and trumpets )

351
00:29:57,264 --> 00:30:02,090
Let the High Prince Adonijah
approach to be anointed king.

352
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:05,232
Solomon is being
crowned king! Wait!

353
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:06,743
Stop him!

354
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:10,354
Stop him!

355
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:12,796
What is the meaning of this?

356
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,001
Hear me! Wait!

357
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,624
Bring him forward!

358
00:30:21,158 --> 00:30:25,439
Wait! Hear me!
I saw them leave the city!

359
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:27,554
They are going
to anoint Solomon king!

360
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,247
You lie!
It's not true!

361
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:32,074
I am anointed by God.

362
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:33,802
Listen, it's true!

363
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:36,459
You can see the procession
from that ridge.

364
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:39,374
Solomon is being anointed king

365
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:42,644
by a decree
from King David himself.

366
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:43,890
I'll show you. . .

367
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,238
- Stop!
- Come on!

368
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:46,833
Wait!

369
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,348
- Stop!
- Come!

370
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:49,908
I am your king!

371
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,188
I command you to stop!

372
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:01,952
Look!

373
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:03,203
I told you!

374
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,404
That is the palace guard.

375
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:08,933
- And Zadok.
- And Nathan the prophet.

376
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:12,651
They would act only
on the word of King David.

377
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,960
We've been lied to.

378
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,681
This is no king.

379
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:20,502
Treason,
that's what it is.

380
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,905
I want no part of it.

381
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:38,272
Stop! Wait!

382
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:40,386
I am your king.

383
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,664
Appointed by God!

384
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:45,702
I command you to stop!

385
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,160
Joab! Stop them!

386
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,340
How?

387
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:54,195
Use your army!

388
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:56,239
To do what?

389
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:59,096
The people fear God
more than they do the army.

390
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,144
Joab!

391
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:02,869
We lost!

392
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:06,489
We moved too soon.

393
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,701
Bathsheba beat us.

394
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:11,840
Too soon?! Lost?

395
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:14,465
You've killed us!

396
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:16,742
Probably.

397
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:18,852
I think that's not
the only sacrificial blood. . .

398
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,900
that will be shed
this day.

399
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:27,884
What's this?

400
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,779
I will not leave this place.

401
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:33,296
Go and tell Solomon
I will not leave this place. . .

402
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,824
till he swears
he will not kill me.

403
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,361
Adonijah, come down!

404
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:38,517
Do as I say!

405
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,256
As you wish,
Your Majesty.

406
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:03,536
You have proven
your courage once again,

407
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:07,763
by delivering yourself
to this court. . .

408
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,069
As always,
I serve my king.

409
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:12,724
Not always, Joab.

410
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:15,034
You killed Absalom,
my son.

411
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,411
Because he rose
against you, my lord.

412
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:19,580
I commanded he be dealt with gently,
you struck him down.

413
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,276
I n a victory for your armies,
my lord.

414
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:23,039
Now you have risen
against me.

415
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:24,735
No, my lord, never!

416
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,662
Against these, yes. . .

417
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,818
but not against my king.

418
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:34,029
Then bow to your king.

419
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,639
King Solomon!

420
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:55,225
As long as you live, Father,
there is only one king in this land.

421
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:09,318
The penalty
for your actions is death.

422
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,254
Wait, wait, wait.

423
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:19,537
My judgment is this:

424
00:34:19,638 --> 00:34:23,635
While I live,
you live.

425
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:25,496
When I'm dead,

426
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:28,467
your life is in the hands
of your new king.

427
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:31,863
You're dismissed
from your command.

428
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,880
You're banished
from Jerusalem.

429
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:39,046
Thank you, my lord.

430
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,458
As always, your judgment
is full of compassion.

431
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,134
Your Majesty. . .

432
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,752
I meant you no harm.

433
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:54,709
What of Adonijah, General?

434
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:56,595
He clings to the holy altar,
my lord,

435
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,868
hoping for sanctuary.

436
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:01,338
Why didn't you
strike him down, General?

437
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:05,694
He is your son, my king.

438
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:19,295
And now, Adonijah.

439
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:20,549
What of him?

440
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,535
It is as you wish, Father.

441
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:28,683
He's also my son,
Solomon.

442
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:32,587
I cannot be impartial
in my judgment.

443
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,638
It was you he sought
to harm.

444
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,808
You must judge him.

445
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:51,934
He is guilty of treason.

446
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,607
The penalty is death.

447
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,147
I meant you no harm.

448
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:32,552
I swear it! I swear it!

449
00:36:37,615 --> 00:36:42,026
I beg of you, spare me my life,
for the love you once bore me!

450
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:45,200
Solomon! Solomon!

451
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:58,906
Our father
showed mercy to Joab,

452
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,914
I shall do
no less for you.

453
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:04,194
If you prove
a loyal and worthy man,

454
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:06,915
not one of your hairs
shall fall to the ground.

455
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,954
But if treachery
is found in you. . .

456
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,805
you shall die.

457
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,613
My brothers. . .

458
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,462
and my people,
hear me.

459
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,819
I had planned
to build a house of rest

460
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:17,406
for the Ark of the Covenant
of the Lord.

461
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,487
But God said to me,

462
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:23,588
You shall not build
a house for My name,

463
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:27,657
for you are a warrior,
you have shed blood.

464
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:31,275
It is your son,
Solomon,

465
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:34,448
who shall build My house
and My courts.

466
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:39,827
Solomon, my son,

467
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:44,058
know the God of your father,
and serve him well,

468
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:46,811
with a single mind
and willing heart.

469
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:49,337
For the Lord
has chosen you

470
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:52,741
to build a house
as a sanctuary.

471
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,167
Be strong, and obey.

472
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:16,784
These are the plans
for the vestibules,

473
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:20,756
treasuries, upper rooms
and inner chambers

474
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:24,542
and all that God wishes
for His house,

475
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:25,820
as given to me.

476
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:35,075
My son is young
and inexperienced,

477
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,515
his task is great.

478
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:40,550
As this shall not
be a temple for mortals,

479
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:43,211
but for the Lord.

480
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,415
But I have provided,
as far as I was able.

481
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:49,300
Bring in. . .

482
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:53,143
( crowd murmurs )

483
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:13,611
Of my God,
I give to my God.

484
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:17,007
And I ask you to do the same.

485
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:20,205
For this shall be
the house of the Lord.

486
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:22,316
Bless the Lord, our God.

487
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,844
Crowd:
Bless the Lord, our God.

488
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:33,563
Solomon, Solomon.
Remember, Solomon,

489
00:40:33,662 --> 00:40:36,665
a king must be strong.

490
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:40,088
If someone bars your way,
he threatens not just you,

491
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:42,586
but the good of the kingdom
as a whole.

492
00:40:42,694 --> 00:40:45,479
You must cut him down,
like wheat.

493
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,000
Can you do that?
Hmm?

494
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:49,864
I can, Father.

495
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:54,026
I should never have granted
the life of Joab.

496
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:57,098
He served me well,
but he has served you badly.

497
00:40:57,203 --> 00:41:01,003
When I'm dead, kill him.
Just kill him. Kill him.

498
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,113
If he plots with Adonijah,
kill them both.

499
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:05,145
Kill them.

500
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,621
You must now be king,
Solomon. . .

501
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:13,465
King!

502
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:44,594
King Solomon!

503
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,327
King Solomon!

504
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,349
King Solomon! King Solomon!
King Solomon!

505
00:42:10,803 --> 00:42:11,852
Abiathar!

506
00:42:13,718 --> 00:42:14,831
Joab!

507
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:17,141
So, this is what you do
in exile?

508
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:19,635
Yes, I've become
a farmer.

509
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,509
Long live
our glorious king!

510
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,065
May he reign
for at least another day!

511
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,019
Come!

512
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:31,940
Let me offer you some wine.

513
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:33,151
Good.

514
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:38,370
There's talk of Solomon
building a temple.

515
00:42:40,237 --> 00:42:41,580
I've heard so.

516
00:42:41,678 --> 00:42:44,135
I should preside as High Priest
when it's finished.

517
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:46,479
You may yet.

518
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:49,745
How? Solomon put that ancient
fossil Zadok in my place.

519
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:55,833
Well, we simply struck too soon.
We should have known. . .

520
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,169
while David is still alive.

521
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:01,239
But our time will come. . .
the moment he dies.

522
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:08,638
Solomon, a king.

523
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:11,647
If I had been in his place,
we'd both be dead men.

524
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:13,894
And who will you put
in Solomon's place?

525
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:16,972
Adonijah, of course.

526
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,618
Adonijah?

527
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,139
I thought you despised
his cowardice at the altar.

528
00:43:24,244 --> 00:43:26,580
Even cowards can be useful
at the right moment.

529
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:30,930
( chuckling )

530
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:33,424
Did you tell yourself a joke?

531
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:34,962
For some reason,

532
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,973
a song keeps coming
into my head.

533
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,325
- A song?
- Yes.

534
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:41,915
You remember I once wrote
a song for the Lord

535
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,509
on the day we were
delivered from Saul?

536
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:47,551
Of course,
everyone knows it.

537
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,921
For the waves of death
encompassed me,

538
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,476
the torrents of perdition
assailed me,

539
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:56,431
the cords of Sheol
entangled me,

540
00:43:56,528 --> 00:43:59,400
the snares of death
confronted me.

541
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:03,627
- So. . .?
- We were so dramatic!

542
00:44:03,735 --> 00:44:05,591
Torrents, snares, waves.

543
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:11,321
Death is not like that at all.

544
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:13,812
It was when we were young.

545
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:19,008
Yes, but now,
it's whispers, not waves. . .

546
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:22,209
soft currents,
not torrents. . .

547
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,575
and very visible inclines,

548
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:27,399
not snares.

549
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:31,370
Don't talk about death.

550
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,085
The decree from of old is,
Thou must surely die!

551
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:38,834
And kings surely
must have many wives,

552
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:41,074
but we must not
talk about them.

553
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,269
Like flourishing leaves
on a spreading tree. . .

554
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:50,109
which sheds some,
and puts forth others,

555
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:52,665
so are the generations
of flesh and blood.

556
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:54,844
One dies,
another is born.

557
00:44:54,947 --> 00:44:58,879
Every new creature
decays and ceases to exist.

558
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:01,286
Talk of death
to your other wives.

559
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:03,110
I'm only interested in. . .

560
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:06,760
your beauty,
and your wealth.

561
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:10,702
Bathsheba. . .

562
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:15,278
do you know what I fear
from death most of all?

563
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:18,386
What?

564
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:21,719
The absence of you.

565
00:46:52,587 --> 00:46:54,377
( dirge horns )

566
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:23,172
You'll never have her now.

567
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:26,884
- Joab. . .
- She has status now.

568
00:47:26,984 --> 00:47:30,565
She is no longer the daughter
of a simple salt fish dealer.

569
00:47:30,668 --> 00:47:32,612
She was the favorite
of our greatest king.

570
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:34,148
I know this, I know this.

571
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:36,745
And when she is passed along
to Solomon, he'll have her.

572
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,705
Give me peace, Joab.

573
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,007
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to be king!

574
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,251
Solomon is king!

575
00:47:56,354 --> 00:47:58,112
Well. . .

576
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:01,761
only till you wrench the crown
from his feeble grasp.

577
00:48:06,347 --> 00:48:07,941
David is dead.

578
00:48:08,045 --> 00:48:10,054
That leaves only
one power in the palace.

579
00:48:11,664 --> 00:48:13,607
Bathsheba.

580
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:15,208
Bathsheba.

581
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:20,821
But first we must show the people
that she no longer has. . .

582
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,809
a firm hand on the throne.

583
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,388
How?

584
00:48:33,315 --> 00:48:36,481
If you could take Abishag,
David's favorite,

585
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:39,267
from under the nose
of the new king,

586
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:42,600
it would show you're still in the fight.
The people would notice.

587
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:47,045
She wants me.
I know she does.

588
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,487
Of course she does,
anyone can see that.

589
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,806
How should we do it?

590
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,978
Simple.
Just ask.

591
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,455
Ask?

592
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:01,338
Demand.

593
00:49:01,435 --> 00:49:04,886
He'll want to placate you.
Solomon's weak,

594
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:09,216
showing you his mercy,
so that you will join his allies.

595
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,744
And soon you will have. . .

596
00:49:10,852 --> 00:49:12,796
Abishag!

597
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:20,515
The throne.

598
00:49:21,517 --> 00:49:24,007
( keening )

599
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,341
Thank you
for granting me this audience.

600
00:50:35,726 --> 00:50:38,117
Do you come in peace?

601
00:50:38,224 --> 00:50:40,113
I n peace.

602
00:50:41,395 --> 00:50:43,469
May I speak openly with you?

603
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,811
Go on.

604
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:47,189
You know,

605
00:50:47,288 --> 00:50:50,488
you know
the kingdom was mine.

606
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:52,760
And all of Israel
expected me to reign.

607
00:50:58,177 --> 00:51:00,448
But things change.

608
00:51:00,547 --> 00:51:03,070
The kingdom
has fallen to my brother. . .

609
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:05,663
For it was his,
from the Lord.

610
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:14,476
So now, I have one request
to make of you.

611
00:51:14,576 --> 00:51:16,170
Please do not refuse me.

612
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:18,474
Go on.

613
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,878
Please ask Solomon. . .

614
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:24,920
King Solomon,

615
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:27,125
for he will not refuse you--

616
00:51:28,861 --> 00:51:31,197
to give me Abishag
as my wife.

617
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:37,210
Men. . .

618
00:51:41,672 --> 00:51:43,462
This is all you want?

619
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,868
Very well.

620
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:50,798
I will speak to the king.

621
00:51:53,522 --> 00:51:54,985
Adonijah,

622
00:51:56,436 --> 00:51:58,773
the kingdom was never yours.

623
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,094
It was always,

624
00:52:03,195 --> 00:52:05,881
and will always be--

625
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,095
mine.

626
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:34,772
God of my father,
and my father's father,

627
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,694
give me strength
and courage

628
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,696
that I may be worthy
of this honorable duty,

629
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:41,528
and serve you well. . .

630
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:44,410
for I am weak. . .

631
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:51,867
and fearful.

632
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:32,833
Forgive me, Father.

633
00:53:32,937 --> 00:53:35,842
I do not deserve
your throne,

634
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:39,693
but now I must be king,
as you commanded.

635
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:54,453
May the King live forever!

636
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:56,118
Oh, Mother!

637
00:53:58,912 --> 00:54:01,085
Please take. . .

638
00:54:01,186 --> 00:54:03,609
Bring a chair for my mother!

639
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:11,817
The ruler of Israel
bows to no one, Solomon.

640
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,804
Yes, I can see that.

641
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:19,531
Come, Mother.
Don't be humble,

642
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,676
take your rightful place.

643
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:39,577
Thank you for putting me here,
Mother.

644
00:54:39,684 --> 00:54:41,791
I didn't put you here,
Solomon.

645
00:54:41,893 --> 00:54:43,389
Of course you did.

646
00:54:44,712 --> 00:54:48,775
But now that I am here,
I will deserve it.

647
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:53,386
By God and all His glory,
I will fulfill the destiny of Israel.

648
00:54:54,577 --> 00:54:58,737
I have a request to make.
Do not refuse me.

649
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:04,243
Make your request, my mother,
for you know I will not refuse you.

650
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:13,499
Give Abishag to your brother
as his wife.

651
00:55:16,677 --> 00:55:20,028
And why do you ask this
for Adonijah?

652
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:24,965
Because he came,
as a request.

653
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:29,512
I tell you so you may
know his mind.

654
00:55:29,616 --> 00:55:32,750
His mind
is to have the throne.

655
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:37,423
Good, my son.

656
00:55:37,526 --> 00:55:40,343
And so he begins again.

657
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:43,062
First, he asks
for this maiden,

658
00:55:43,164 --> 00:55:45,173
then next he will ask
for the kingdom!

659
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:48,094
For he knows that any show
of weakness on my part

660
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:50,560
will be a demonstration
of his power.

661
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:52,220
Joab is near to that.

662
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:55,261
Now therefore as the Lord lives,
who has established me,

663
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:58,151
and placed me on this throne
of my Father, David,

664
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:04,933
today. . .

665
00:56:05,038 --> 00:56:08,686
Adonijah and Joab must die!

666
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:15,489
Hey. . . !

667
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,353
Come back!

668
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:51,390
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

669
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:52,508
Move aside!

670
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:14,097
Traitor!

671
00:57:15,192 --> 00:57:16,121
Get him!

672
00:57:25,762 --> 00:57:28,185
I was to be king.

673
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:31,806
But you die as a traitor.

674
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:16,352
I ordered you
to kill him!

675
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:18,726
But my Lord King,
he's taken sanctuary!

676
00:58:18,825 --> 00:58:21,161
Even now, he's in the Holy
Tabernacle, clinging to the altar!

677
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:29,933
I don't care where he is!

678
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,544
Strike him down!

679
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:45,783
Joab?

680
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:49,403
It's by command of the king.

681
00:58:49,508 --> 00:58:51,397
You are to die.

682
00:58:54,537 --> 00:58:57,157
The king commands
you come out, Joab.

683
00:58:57,259 --> 00:58:59,049
No.

684
00:58:59,149 --> 00:59:00,808
I'll die here.

685
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,051
I beg you,
don't make me kill you there.

686
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:04,364
I would commit sacrilege.

687
00:59:04,466 --> 00:59:06,223
Which you cannot--

688
00:59:06,323 --> 00:59:08,332
dare not, Benaiah.

689
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:13,906
I'm not ready to die.

690
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:17,271
Listen to me!

691
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:19,545
You know as well as I ,
there's not a man in Israel

692
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:22,715
fit to rule
in place of King David.

693
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:26,618
Did you think I believed
Adonijah could truly be a king?!

694
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:28,384
He was but a pawn.

695
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:30,081
The people's favorite,
oh, yes,

696
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:32,641
but ruler of Israel?

697
00:59:33,623 --> 00:59:34,999
And Solomon. . .

698
00:59:35,097 --> 00:59:36,920
that weakling?

699
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:39,387
To rule over
God's chosen people?

700
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:41,210
No!

701
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,588
Benaiah. . .

702
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:49,476
the only real power to rule. . .

703
00:59:49,573 --> 00:59:51,680
lies in the army.

704
00:59:51,783 --> 00:59:54,371
Only the army
can save our nation.

705
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:57,258
Let Solomon remain king,
yes,

706
00:59:57,356 --> 00:59:59,977
but grant me my life--

707
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:02,502
and together
we will have the power.

708
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:06,321
Israel needs the army,
the army needs me. . .

709
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,587
you-- and me.

710
01:00:10,187 --> 01:00:12,458
Together, Benaiah,
we will be the real power

711
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:14,347
to guarantee Israel's glory.

712
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:15,692
God's glory!

713
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:17,353
But the king has commanded!

714
01:00:17,457 --> 01:00:19,313
Bathsheba has commanded!

715
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,835
Solomon is too weak!

716
01:00:21,942 --> 01:00:24,082
You know I'm right,
Benaiah!

717
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:29,720
Is the mother's command
greater than the will of God?

718
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:35,260
Well, my friend?

719
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:37,567
Will you obey the king?

720
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,833
The king's mother?

721
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:42,910
Or your God?

722
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,270
Aarrgh!

723
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:30,984
Mighty King. . .

724
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:34,927
I thank you for your kindnesses
to us and to our daughter.

725
01:01:35,702 --> 01:01:37,230
But what I . . .

726
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:39,442
I buy a good pearl
when I can,

727
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:41,914
for my daughter's future,
you understand.

728
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:44,723
But your bounty has--

729
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,490
has far outshone their worth.

730
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,212
Perhaps--

731
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:51,771
perhaps they could be used
in the temple.

732
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,783
They're poor things,
I know,

733
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:57,093
but I give them to you.

734
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:02,251
To you, Solomon,

735
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:04,937
and to the great God
we all serve,

736
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,213
the God of Israel.

737
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:09,519
I accept them
with pleasure.

738
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:12,077
And may God
keep you all in His hands.

739
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,593
We go!

740
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:13,800
Now will I prepare
to build Your temple, Lord,

741
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,724
here at the altar of Gibeon.

742
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:17,896
I'll make sacrifices,

743
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:20,489
cleanse my heart,

744
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:22,286
and listen.

745
01:04:05,689 --> 01:04:07,316
Solomon.

746
01:04:07,419 --> 01:04:09,330
Enter, Solomon.

747
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,415
Ask what you will of Me,
Solomon.

748
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:11,277
I am only as a child,
my Lord.

749
01:05:11,379 --> 01:05:14,960
I do not know how to go out
or come in.

750
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:18,997
Grant me the wisdom
and knowledge

751
01:05:19,098 --> 01:05:22,003
to righteously rule
this great people of yours.

752
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:25,146
Because you have not
asked for riches,

753
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,770
or long life,
or the lives of your enemies,

754
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:31,073
I give you the wisdom
of a clear and discerning mind.

755
01:05:31,173 --> 01:05:32,996
But you must walk
in My ways,

756
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:36,326
keeping My statutes
and My commandments.

757
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:02,077
This skirmish was simply
a patrol to test our strength.

758
01:06:02,176 --> 01:06:05,921
Our scouts confirm massed forces
just inside the Egyptian border,

759
01:06:06,019 --> 01:06:07,930
which can mean
only one thing. . .

760
01:06:08,037 --> 01:06:10,756
the new pharaoh, Shishak,
prepares to invade.

761
01:06:10,855 --> 01:06:13,989
Well, if we do have
a war on our hands. . .

762
01:06:15,307 --> 01:06:17,480
God be with us.

763
01:06:19,823 --> 01:06:24,716
Jerusalem--
the Egyptian border-- Tyre.

764
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:28,139
General Benaiah, I want officers
to ride to every city in Israel,

765
01:06:28,246 --> 01:06:30,550
measuring the distance
in the number of days it takes.

766
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:33,018
And I want to know the strength
of our army in each city,

767
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:35,800
foot soldiers, cavalry,
charioteers.

768
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:39,450
If we must fight, I want to know
what chance we have.

769
01:06:43,363 --> 01:06:45,951
By Royal Decree,
from today,

770
01:06:46,054 --> 01:06:49,701
the Kingdom of Israel and Judah
will be divided into twelve provinces.

771
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,515
I will appoint
a governor over each,

772
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:56,234
who will be responsible
directly to me,

773
01:06:56,335 --> 01:06:58,093
who will administer
law and order,

774
01:06:58,193 --> 01:07:01,065
and who will oversee
the collection of taxes. . .

775
01:07:01,171 --> 01:07:03,213
( muttering and groaning )

776
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:08,851
. . .which from today
will be increased by one tenth.

777
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,626
( uproar )

778
01:07:19,523 --> 01:07:21,085
Very impressive,
General Benaiah.

779
01:07:21,189 --> 01:07:24,038
Yes, but they are few compared
to the legions of Egypt.

780
01:07:24,135 --> 01:07:27,007
If they invade,
there'll be many widows in Israel.

781
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,046
When the Egyptians advance,
fall back before them. Don't fight!

782
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:33,518
Let thirst and the desert
do our fighting for us.

783
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,553
We can only fall back so far,
my lord, before we must fight.

784
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:38,153
Happily we won't have to.

785
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,651
Your king is to be married,
Benaiah!

786
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:42,068
A wedding!

787
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,755
I'm arranging to marry
the daughter of the pharaoh!

788
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:46,135
Let's hope she isn't ugly.

789
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:18,870
No war!
Peace through marriage!

790
01:08:18,968 --> 01:08:21,905
Our king is
a brilliant statesman!

791
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,347
Long live the king!

792
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:28,725
Long live Solomon!
Long live Solomon!

793
01:08:29,248 --> 01:08:31,771
( fanfare )

794
01:08:52,885 --> 01:08:55,221
( music plays )

795
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:26,737
( cheering )

796
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,456
Ah, Nathan!

797
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:38,079
So, how is married life?

798
01:10:38,183 --> 01:10:39,810
Very pleasant.

799
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:42,280
Very pleasant, indeed.

800
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,146
The pleasures of the body
are not to be missed, Nathan.

801
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:50,545
I have chosen to concentrate
on God's love, my lord.

802
01:10:50,642 --> 01:10:54,290
Do you really think He meant you
to deny yourself, Nathan?

803
01:10:54,389 --> 01:10:56,912
He made us this way,
did He not?

804
01:10:57,016 --> 01:11:00,215
Why would He not want us
to taste of the fruit?

805
01:11:00,315 --> 01:11:04,093
God put many things on Earth
we are not to taste, my lord.

806
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:07,575
If it were not so,
we would not have a free will,

807
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:12,387
and He would not be God, but
simply the creator of blind animals.

808
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:14,658
But I have tasted.

809
01:11:14,759 --> 01:11:17,347
And I like it.

810
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:20,616
You are allowed,
even required, my lord.

811
01:11:20,716 --> 01:11:22,823
But I warn you. . .

812
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:26,474
be careful not to give
yourself to any woman,

813
01:11:26,577 --> 01:11:30,639
so that she gains. . .
mastery over your strength.

814
01:11:30,741 --> 01:11:33,777
It may be too late, Nathan.
I'm exhausted!

815
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:41,971
But I have a matter
of some concern.

816
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,062
Speak.

817
01:11:43,168 --> 01:11:45,985
It is rumored that you're allowing
your Egyptian wife

818
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:47,577
to build a temple
to Amon Ra.

819
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:49,508
I had to, of course.

820
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:51,997
It's a political marriage.
It's part of the treaty.

821
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:55,554
I'm not going to war over one
woman's temple to a foreign god!

822
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:57,220
It's against God's law.

823
01:11:57,324 --> 01:12:00,710
Does God want war, Nathan?
I think not.

824
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:02,278
What of your other wives?

825
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:03,847
I haven't got any other wives.

826
01:12:03,954 --> 01:12:07,023
You may eventually have many.
You grant the same to all of them?

827
01:12:07,124 --> 01:12:07,986
Nathan!

828
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:10,476
The thought of having many wives
is too terrifying to contemplate.

829
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:12,975
I can barely satisfy this one.

830
01:12:18,591 --> 01:12:19,803
Nathan. . .

831
01:12:19,904 --> 01:12:22,590
I worship the one true God.

832
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:26,847
He will understand
even if you will not.

833
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,231
The king must be aware
that any child

834
01:12:31,338 --> 01:12:33,250
from the daughter
of the Pharaoh of Egypt

835
01:12:33,356 --> 01:12:36,621
cannot inherit the thrones
of Israel and J Judah.

836
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,714
I am perfectly
aware of that, Zadok.

837
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,232
But the council
must also be aware that

838
01:12:45,334 --> 01:12:48,851
there are other reasons for marriage
than just the begetting of heirs.

839
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:51,825
I married the pharaoh's daughter
to avert war and bloodshed.

840
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:53,362
- But my lord. . . !
- Zadok. . .

841
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:58,395
in future, be advised that
I will marry to consolidate my lands

842
01:12:58,498 --> 01:12:59,929
and to promote trade.

843
01:13:00,035 --> 01:13:02,820
I will marry to insure peace
with my allies,

844
01:13:02,918 --> 01:13:06,849
to discomfort my enemies
and to please myself.

845
01:13:08,107 --> 01:13:10,597
And I assure you. . .

846
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,769
that I will marry to beget
heirs to the throne. . .

847
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:17,169
when I am ready!

848
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:52,539
Is it always like this?

849
01:14:52,646 --> 01:14:55,648
Oh, I find fathers
always survive the ordeal.

850
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,946
A boy!

851
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:20,988
Oh, a fine Jewish boy.

852
01:15:21,087 --> 01:15:22,714
I shall call him Rehoboam,

853
01:15:22,817 --> 01:15:25,274
as a sign that the people
of Israel shall multiply.

854
01:15:25,379 --> 01:15:29,660
Mother, meet the heir
to the throne of David.

855
01:15:30,983 --> 01:15:32,708
Shh. . .

856
01:15:32,809 --> 01:15:34,371
A boy!

857
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:36,418
A boy!

858
01:15:36,525 --> 01:15:38,348
The King has a boy!

859
01:15:40,464 --> 01:15:42,921
( murmuring )

860
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:50,742
The purchaser of the horse
claims he was not told. . .

861
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:53,210
of the vicious nature
of the beast.

862
01:15:53,948 --> 01:15:56,054
Yet in the terms of the contract,
he was perfectly at liberty

863
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:58,068
to try the animal
before offering payment,

864
01:15:58,176 --> 01:15:59,639
or accepting delivery.

865
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:02,430
The seller has the right
to remain silent

866
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:05,086
and let the buyer find
any fault he can.

867
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:08,291
It is the buyer's fault
if he does not do so.

868
01:16:10,186 --> 01:16:11,976
The buyer must pay
full price.

869
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:15,180
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my king.

870
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:20,946
Zadok, why are there
so many people here today?

871
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,980
There is great interest
in the next case, my lord.

872
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:28,305
It came before the Provincial
Governor of Gilead.

873
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,906
Old Bengeber?

874
01:16:31,068 --> 01:16:34,552
The facts are simple,
but the case, very complex.

875
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:37,276
Your judgment
is eagerly awaited.

876
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,575
( rapping staff )

877
01:16:45,673 --> 01:16:47,016
my Lord King--

878
01:16:47,114 --> 01:16:49,288
the facts of this case. . .

879
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:52,326
are well established,
and are not in dispute.

880
01:16:52,431 --> 01:16:57,225
The two petitioners share a house
on the outskirts of Gilead,

881
01:16:57,331 --> 01:17:00,630
where they ply their trade
as prostitutes.

882
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:04,920
Some six months ago,
one gave birth,

883
01:17:05,018 --> 01:17:08,818
and shortly thereafter,
the second did likewise.

884
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,797
Both had boy children.

885
01:17:12,865 --> 01:17:17,244
This dispute arose
after one of the babies died.

886
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:20,679
You may each state your case.

887
01:17:20,776 --> 01:17:22,817
You go first,
you lying cow.

888
01:17:22,922 --> 01:17:24,746
Then I'll tell the truth.

889
01:17:27,886 --> 01:17:31,501
Well, we each have
our own room--

890
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,753
Are you a citizen
of this country?

891
01:17:38,327 --> 01:17:40,915
Yet you show no respect
to your king?

892
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:46,774
Now, rise--

893
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,881
state your name
and the facts as you see them.

894
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,760
My name is Basemah.

895
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:57,604
It was just us in the house.

896
01:17:58,505 --> 01:18:00,230
Us and our babies.

897
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:05,259
I'd gone to bed
with little Joachim.

898
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:07,149
- That's his name. . .
- Michael!

899
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:09,225
- Michael is his name!
- Silence!

900
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,926
Me and Joachim. . .

901
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,717
went to sleep.

902
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:22,900
And I'd given him
a good meal,

903
01:18:23,007 --> 01:18:25,791
and he was
a happy little baby.

904
01:18:25,889 --> 01:18:28,892
Well, that pig must have rolled
on her baby. . .

905
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:31,004
and killed him,

906
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:35,007
because when I woke up,
there was her baby beside me. . .

907
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:36,675
dead. . .

908
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,405
and my Joachim was gone.

909
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:40,265
- Liar!
- Silence!

910
01:18:40,365 --> 01:18:43,085
- A mother knows her own baby!
- That is my baby!

911
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:44,615
Silence!

912
01:18:45,586 --> 01:18:47,693
I'd pick him out
from a thousand!

913
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:20,496
What is your name?

914
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:22,482
Hannah, my lord.

915
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,029
Tell your story, Hannah.

916
01:19:26,133 --> 01:19:27,760
It's a pack of lies!

917
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:30,102
She's clumsy enough
to smother her own child,

918
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:32,757
and thinks she can get away
with claiming mine!

919
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:34,868
That's my Michael!

920
01:19:34,973 --> 01:19:38,686
And no woman,
or man on earth--

921
01:19:38,785 --> 01:19:41,821
is going to take him
away from me--

922
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:43,648
Your Majesty.

923
01:19:43,749 --> 01:19:47,844
That is for the King
to decide.

924
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:57,008
Was no midwife present?

925
01:19:57,105 --> 01:19:58,535
No, my lord.

926
01:20:02,326 --> 01:20:04,400
Lay the child on that table.

927
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:09,778
My judgment is this--

928
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:13,915
since both women
claim the living child

929
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:16,090
and neither
claim the dead child,

930
01:20:16,193 --> 01:20:19,873
it is therefore fair that they
should share the living child.

931
01:20:20,997 --> 01:20:23,388
So, I will cut
the child in half.

932
01:20:24,873 --> 01:20:26,216
( pleading and outcries )

933
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:34,190
Spare my baby!

934
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,950
Don't kill him!

935
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:43,381
She can have him.

936
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:57,861
God bless this child. . .

937
01:20:57,959 --> 01:20:59,651
Crowd:
God bless this child.

938
01:20:59,752 --> 01:21:00,767
. . .and his children's children.

939
01:21:00,873 --> 01:21:03,395
Crowd:
And his children's children.

940
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:07,592
And most of all. . .

941
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:13,422
his true mother.

942
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,086
Crowd:
Solomon! Solomon!

943
01:21:59,388 --> 01:22:01,529
( chanting continues )

944
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,613
He spoke to the crowd
and said,

945
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:11,264
It is my judgment that both
women should share the child.

946
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:14,435
This is not wise.
A child cannot have two mothers.

947
01:22:14,537 --> 01:22:16,295
They will fight
and ruin its childhood.

948
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:19,015
He took the baby,
laid it on a table,

949
01:22:19,118 --> 01:22:21,541
drew a sword
from a nearby soldier. . .

950
01:22:21,648 --> 01:22:23,308
and what do you think
he did?

951
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:26,227
I don't know.
Killed one of the mothers?

952
01:22:26,324 --> 01:22:27,918
He raised the sword
over the baby

953
01:22:28,022 --> 01:22:30,479
and declared he was going
to cut it in half!

954
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:32,341
Brilliant!

955
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:35,291
When the real mother saw
he was going to kill the baby,

956
01:22:35,388 --> 01:22:36,337
she ran forward. . .

957
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:38,268
and screamed for the baby
to be saved. . .

958
01:22:38,366 --> 01:22:41,598
. . .even if it meant giving
the baby to the other woman!

959
01:22:41,697 --> 01:22:43,608
Exactly, my queen!

960
01:22:45,573 --> 01:22:47,003
Brilliant!
