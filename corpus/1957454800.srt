a little bit.

354
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,590
We never eat dead things.

355
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,758
Only things with life.

356
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:33,560
Anything with life?

357

358

it's far less satisfying.

be hungry again?

360
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:44,905

tonight, maybe tomorrow.

suddenly when it comes.

362
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,813
Okay, well there's not much around
here that you can eat that's living

363
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:55,548

come up with something.

- [Amanda] No!

365
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,588
No no no no no! My cat is not
available for dinner, okay?

366
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:04,991
So just get that thought right
outta your head.

367
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,826
Or me.

368
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:13,533

would absolutely be stupid of you to eat me okay?
