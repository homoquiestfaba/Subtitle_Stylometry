1
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,402
I feel...

2
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,907
...like I have to perform around you.

3
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,909
It's just me.

4
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:51,978
It's just Walter.

5
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,115
Maybe it's not bad if I feel that way.

6
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,851
I used to entertain a lot.

7
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,520
I remember.

8
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,854
Do you?

9
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:02,954
Of course.

10
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,224
Marjorie, where are the dishes?

11
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,501
The girl did them, Julie.

12
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,370
She doesn't come until two.

13
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,205
I did them.

14
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,176
You didn't, your arthritis.

15
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,179
I'm having a good day.

16
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:31,517
Marjorie, we both know
what no dishes means.

17
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,651
It means i
haven't been eating.

18
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,157
Only a spoonful
of peanut butter.

19
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,959
I'm not hungry.

20
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,196
It's their fault, feeding
me all those pills.

21
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,095
The pills are their
fault or your doctors?

22
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,136
Only a spoonful?

23
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:01,314
Can I still play the violin?

24
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,348
I'm sure it's all in your
head still, but your hands.

25
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:47,326
I could tell you a story.

26
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,629
You liked that the last time.

27
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,665
I'll have to take
your word for it.

28
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,635
I could tell you about
the time we saw a movie.

29
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,536
We went to a lot of movies.

30
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:01,407
But one time we saw "my
best friend's wedding."

31
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,676
"My best friend's wedding."

32
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,413
There was a woman,
Julia Roberts.

33
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,683
For a while, it was
always Julia Roberts.

34
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,219
And she had an agreement with
her best friend, her male best

35
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,154
friend, that if
they weren't married

36
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,256
by the time they
hit a certain age,

37
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,992
they would marry each other.

38
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:23,663
And she was about to remind
him of this agreement

39
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,364
when it turns out he
had already fallen

40
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:30,069
in love with a nice
blonde, Cameron Diaz.

41
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,705
So Julia Roberts
spends the entire movie

42
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,674
trying to ruin things
between her friend

43
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,477
and Cameron Diaz, which isn't
very sympathetic behavior

44
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:42,214
for America's sweetheart.

45
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:44,283
But in the end,
it all works out.

46
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,317
And she has a gay best friend
who delivers one liners.

47
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:53,326
You said you wanted a gay
best friend afterwards.

48
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,593
I had a gay best friend.

49
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:55,693
I had two of them.

50
00:04:58,596 --> 00:04:59,596
I'll remember that now.

51
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:09,175
Why did you pick that story,
"my best friend's wedding?"

52
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,711
That was the night
i proposed to you.

53
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh Marjorie, the
things you forget.

54
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,585
That's ok.

55
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:24,123
You were trying to tell
me and I wouldn't let you.

56
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,560
What if we saw
"Casablanca" instead.

57
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,131
Let's say that we saw
"Casablanca" in an old movie

58
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,767
theater with velvet seats,
and then on the way home

59
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:35,867
you proposed.

60
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,840
And then by the next time
we talk it will be true.

61
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,480
You mean make it up?

62
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,317
Oh, you're very serious.

63
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,550
Oh, you're like them,
especially Tess.

64
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,590
Our daughter.

65
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,495
Our daughter, Tess, and
her over-solicitous husband.

66
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,564
No-- no, no that's not fair.

67
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,500
I like him.

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,602
I didn't then.

69
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,570
But now I do.

70
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,807
Do you like me?

71
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,475
Don't be an idiot.

72
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,411
Don't call me an idiot.

73
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,713
Idiot.

74
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,646
Why do you like
me if I'm an idiot?

75
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,819
What?

76
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:33,292
I'll get in trouble.

77
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,828
In trouble?

78
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,662
For talking to you that
way, in trouble with Tess.

79
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:46,336
You don't always
understand, do you?

80
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,380
Tell me about the
time we got Toni.

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,082
I told you that
story yesterday.

82
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,182
I like that story.

83
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:07,660
There was once a couple,
a very fine, young couple.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,496
And he had a good strong jaw.

85
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,963
He was a little too
pleased with himself.

86
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:23,442
He had a good strong jaw,
and he was a little too

87
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:26,245
pleased with himself.

88
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,582
And she was the most
beautiful woman in town.

89
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,852
It wasn't a very big town,
but she was the queen of it.

90
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,522
It sounds like a fairy
tale when you tell it.

91
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,622
It is a fairy tale.

92
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:42,261
That's not very nice.

93
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,562
I don't mean that--

94
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:44,830
--it never happened.
- I thought that--

95
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,499
--You were supposed to provide comfort.

96
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,136
I meant that that's the way it happened,
like a fairy tale.

97
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,705
It was?

98
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,274
Now this couple was
feeling a bit lonely,

99
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,410
because they didn't
have any children yet.

100
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,713
So one day they decided
it was time to get a dog.

101
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,349
They took the bus down
to the city pound.

102
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,818
And there was a little
black dog there asleep,

103
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:12,691
its tummy going up and down
like a little sleeping shadow.

104
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,627
And so they named it Toni.

105
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,662
- Toni. With an I.
- Toni with an I.

106
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,664
Short for Antoinette.

107
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,335
She had a French name
because she was a French poodle.

108
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,272
But not the fussy kind
that look like hedges.

109
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,608
No, this was a poodle
for fetching sticks

110
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,210
and running on the beach.

111
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,313
So they took her
home on the bus.

112
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,448
She was very well behaved.

113
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,717
And they loved
her, and she loved

114
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,922
them back for a long time.

115
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:48,625
And then, like everything
else, she died.

116
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:57,603
Would you like me to keep going?

117
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,306
There's more after she died?

118
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,607
Yes.

119
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,544
Because the couple,
soon after, had a child.

120
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,346
Tess.

121
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,716
Which is a variation on Tessa,
which is Greek for "gatherer."

122
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,785
Oh, don't show off.

123
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,623
So when Tess was three years old,
they went to the pound.

124
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,924
- Oh, yes.
- The same pound.

125
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,593
They had an old Subaru
by this point,

126
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,462
so they didn't have to take the bus.

127
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:27,266
And of course, they let young
Tess pick out the new dog.

128
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,335
There were more dogs there.

129
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,005
A cocker spaniel, a
noble gray pointer,

130
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,007
and a very attractive mutt.

131
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,010
But the amazing
thing, was Tess picked

132
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,980
the poodle, the little
black sleeping shadow.

133
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,948
That was the one
she liked the best.

134
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:47,286
And so we named it Toni two.

135
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,554
Toni two.

136
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,021
But that was soon
shortened to just Toni.

137
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,961
And of course, it
wasn't exactly Toni.

138
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,997
But the longer they
had her, the less

139
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,000
it mattered which Toni it
was that ran along the beach,

140
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,670
and which Toni it was the dug
up all the bulbs in the garden.

141
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,874
The more time that passed,
the more she became

142
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,507
the same dog in their memories.

143
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,415
Who told you all that?

144
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,484
You did.

145
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,619
I talk that much?

146
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,952
Well, you and Jon.

147
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:28,727
You have your good
days when you remember.

148
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,497
Another spoonful?

149
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:38,771
It was the second Toni
who loved the beach.

150
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,971
Though it's a shame we
didn't have her longer.

151
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:48,547
Even though she always
had sand in her hair.

152
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,982
Fur?

153
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,652
No, hair like a
human sounds right.

154
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:54,752
I'll remember that now.

155
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:08,000
Something's a little
off with the nose.

156
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,468
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,036
Or maybe it's my
memory and you're right.

158
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,114
Well, you're a good
Walter either way.

159
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,214
Thank you.

160
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:37,961
Stay with me while?

161
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,570
I don't want to
get you in trouble.

162
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,373
You learn like that.

163
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,676
I told you.

164
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,879
What would you like
to talk about now?

165
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,480
We don't have to
talk, we can just sit.

166
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,753
Sometimes I get so tired.

167
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,995
I'll be right here,
Marjorie, whenever you need.

168
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,266
I have all the time in the world.

169
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,655
I still don't like it.

170
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,890
What?

171
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,958
The prime.

172
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,427
Ah.

173
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,695
Well, at this stage--

174
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,998
who said it?

175
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,967
Companionship is the
most important thing.

176
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:52,037
You said it.

177
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:56,475
It's better than
watching television.

178
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,575
As if she's an infant
that needs to be pacified.

179
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,110
She's 85.
She wakes up,

180
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:03,647
she doesn't know where she is.

181
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,551
And by the way,
what's wrong with being pacified?

182
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:36,815
She's sleeping.

183
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,784
Those new pills seemed
to knock her out.

184
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,118
Peanut butter.

185
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:42,254
Oh, small miracles.

186
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,957
She's finally coming to my campaign.

187
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,759
Or she's listening to Walter prime.

188
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,662
They say it's like a parrot that way.

189
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:53,665
Have a spoonful, have a spoonful.

190
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:56,268
Did you know that
parrots live forever?

191
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:02,040
I have a student who's got her
dad's parrot after he died.

192
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,878
And she says even now
20 years later, it

193
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,880
still says things in his voice.

194
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,248
Like what?

195
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,185
Mostly just, hey
there, partner.

196
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,521
Words of wisdom.

197
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,690
Well, she says it's
not exactly his voice,

198
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,390
but she can definitely
tell that it's him.

199
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,364
Did you just--

200
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:38,277
the way she's so accepting of
it, does that creep you out?

201
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,045
It creeps me out.

202
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,782
Does it bother you that your
mother is talking to a computer

203
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,918
program, or that
a computer program

204
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,085
is pretending to be your dad?

205
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,288
It bothers me
that you are helping

206
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,759
it pretend to be some fountain
of youth version of my dad.

207
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,661
It's how she remembers him.

208
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,096
And she accepts it,
because it's clever.

209
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:01,199
Clever like a mirror,
like a backboard,

210
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,701
no, no it's more than that.

211
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,303
It can look stuff up.

212
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,171
It can talk to other primes.

213
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,708
It's like a child learning to
talk, only does it so quickly.

214
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,843
That's how we think
we're talking to a human.

215
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,179
The more you talk,
the more it absorbs,

216
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,582
including our imperfections.

217
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,884
It can speak in fragments.

218
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,118
It can use non-sequiturs.

219
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:23,789
It can you know,
misplace modifiers.

220
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,123
It can--

221
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,724
it can run out of steam
trying to list things.

222
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:31,828
So you get.

223
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,836
Are you jealous?

224
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,037
No.

225
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,137
You are.

226
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,211
Am I supposed
to just not notice

227
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,147
that she's nicer to that
thing than she is to me.

228
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,784
It's your father that
she's being nicer to.

229
00:15:52,884 --> 00:15:55,120
Mom, your up.

230
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,622
Do you want some tea?

231
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,990
I can put on the kettle.

232
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,625
I ate some peanut butter.

233
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,659
Yes, you did.

234
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,394
That's wonderful.

235
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,830
I thought that
would make her happy.

236
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,633
Yeah, yeah,
I'm very predictable.

237
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,936
Did you sleep well?

238
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,272
I was watching the woman
on TV, the strident one,

239
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,072
and then just out.

240
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,147
That's how it should
happen when it happens.

241
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,816
Don't be morbid,
of morbid.

242
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,118
Oh, yes.

243
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,755
Let's all pretend
we live forever.

244
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,724
You got your color back.

245
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,993
Thank you, Jon.

246
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,327
It's always nice to be lied to.

247
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:43,869
I like him more now that
he cut off his beard.

248
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,672
That was 30 years ago.

249
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,206
It wasn't.

250
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,409
Yeah, it was.

251
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,981
And you stopped worrying about
impressing me, and that helped.

252
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,384
Hey, could you
check on the

253
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,253
there was plenty on Monday.

254
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,788
Julie said we ran out
last week and it was not pretty.

255
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:13,496
There is someone in my mind.

256
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm trying to figure
out who it is.

257
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,343
Raina is
coming this weekend,

258
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:28,180
your loving granddaughter.

259
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,316
I know who Raina is.

260
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,118
How is she?

261
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,020
She's got blue hair.

262
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,456
It suits her.

263
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:43,762
Nine restoril
and six

264
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,399
I remember waking
up on a bridge

265
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,098
with a lot of people around.

266
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,773
Why were you
sleeping on a bridge?

267
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,810
This is a dream, I take it?

268
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,378
Maybe Walter would remember.

269
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:01,478
We could ask Walter.

270
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:08,453
Mom, dad's been
dead for 15 years.

271
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:12,057
I mean the other
Walter, Walter prime?

272
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:17,560
Ugh, I'm not that far gone.

273
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:10,282
Detached?

274
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,050
Well, yeah.

275
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,188
By the time I came along,
you had kind of removed

276
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,190
yourself from the conversation.

277
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,525
You were outside looking in.

278
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,863
Can you tell me more about
my profession, my work?

279
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,498
Haven't you read
up on yourself?

280
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:30,368
In my obituary, professional
details were sparse.

281
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:33,205
Can you describe
what I actually did?

282
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,173
Raping and pillaging.

283
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:36,875
Excuse me?

284
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,978
That was Tess's joke when
i first asked what you did.

285
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,215
You evaluated
financial statements,

286
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,251
corporate investments
for rich people.

287
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,321
And you gave them advice
on how to get richer.

288
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,224
Did I like it?

289
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,093
You were good at it.

290
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:58,496
You realize this is
your house, right?

291
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:01,066
Tess and I moved
in to help Marjorie

292
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,134
10 years after you died.

293
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,271
But before that, when i
met you, you were a guy

294
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,671
whose mind was somewhere else.

295
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:18,216
Also, no offense, you didn't
get prettier as you aged.

296
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,886
Who does?

297
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:25,190
Is it weird that Marjorie
chose you, younger Walter,

298
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,322
to come back into her life?

299
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:33,331
I don't believe that you talked
to Marjorie about your work,

300
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,497
if that's what you're asking.

301
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,938
What is this music?

302
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,306
I don't remember putting it on.

303
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,008
Poulenc.

304
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,143
Marjorie had asked for
it when we spoke last.

305
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,179
I thought it might provide
a pleasant atmosphere.

306
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,279
Oh.

307
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:56,221
Julie, we're ready for you here.

308
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,622
Would you prefer no music?

309
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:01,290
Yeah maybe, for now.

310
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:07,465
Um, you can see how
stressed Tess has been.

311
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:10,602
Well, you could if
she would talk to you.

312
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,339
We were planning a trip.

313
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:20,979
But given Marjorie's-- given
Marjorie's condition that might

314
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,580
not be a good idea right now.

315
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,051
And Julie is going
to be living here

316
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,254
full time to make
sure that Marjorie

317
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,490
gets everything that she needs.

318
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,295
So we determined,
Tess and I, after some

319
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:43,766
spirited back and forth, that
Julie should um, meet you.

320
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,442
Hello.

321
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,377
Hello.

322
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,312
How are you?

323
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,047
How are you?

324
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,984
I'm fine, thank you.

325
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,287
Why are you repeating
everything I say?

326
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:06,291
This is-- this is
Walter, Marjorie's husband.

327
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,127
I believe Tess
explained it to you.

328
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:15,033
Uh, Tess has pretty
decent Spanish.

329
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,067
So do I.

330
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,236
Oh, really?

331
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:19,637
How many other languages?

332
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,206
Many.

333
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,408
Ok, how many?

334
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,376
32.

335
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,478
Well, I have to--

336
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,079
hmm.

337
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,181
I have to admit, I haven't
fully read the brochure.

338
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,591
I'm sorry, what
did you just say?

339
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:47,665
What should we do
to help Marjorie?

340
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:51,300
Um-- hmm.

341
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,266
Scotch, rocks.

342
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,390
Tess?

343
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,592
I thought that was you.

344
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,258
I'm so glad you could make it.

345
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:56,601
Hello?

346
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,304
I'm adjusting
one day at a time.

347
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,308
You know, a similar
thing happened to monte.

348
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,843
Monte?

349
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,411
Our cat.

350
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,780
Well, oh, you loved monte.

351
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,381
What?

352
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:11,349
Sorry.

353
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,484
Hi, mom.

354
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,584
We got caught in the downpour.

355
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,455
We're taking refuge in your
old stomping ground, the club.

356
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:25,730
My stomping ground.

357
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,201
I never really stomped,
did I. I golfed.

358
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,001
That was more Walter's
thing, you know.

359
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,475
Oh, don't fret.

360
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,345
I'm having a good day, I think.

361
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm sharp as a tack.

362
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,516
It sounds like you're outside.

363
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,253
Are you outside, mom,
in this downpour?

364
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,353
Please get Julie.

365
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:12,477
The salversons.

366
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,646
My parents used to leave
me with the salversons

367
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,947
when they went on trips.

368
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,717
Now Mrs. salverson had
a stroke last year.

369
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,050
And she uh--

370
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:26,891
I didn't recognize her.

371
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:31,462
When was the last time
we were in this bar?

372
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,562
Walter's funeral.

373
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:39,871
Memory, sedimentary
layers in the brain.

374
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,873
You get in, you know it's there.

375
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:42,774
You just have to--

376
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,908
no, no.

377
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,410
I thought you knew
the basic idea

378
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,845
according to William James.

379
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:50,615
Maybe, once long ago.

380
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,417
William James had
the idea, and it's

381
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:58,256
been confirmed scientifically,
that memory is not like a well

382
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,359
that you dip into
or a filing cabinet.

383
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:05,263
When you remember something,
you remember the memory.

384
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,334
You remember the last time you
remembered it, not the source.

385
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,402
So it's always getting
fuzzier, like a photocopy

386
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,638
of a photocopy.

387
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,575
It's never getting
fresher or clearer.

388
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,544
So even a very
strong memory can be

389
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:26,618
unreliable, because it's always
in the process of dissolving.

390
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,286
All I remember
about William James

391
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,589
is the gertrude Stein story.

392
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,492
Changing the subject, are we?

393
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,729
She was taking his philosophy
course, old gertrude,

394
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,265
at Harvard.

395
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,866
And she hadn't studied.

396
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:46,337
So she writes in the
exam book, I'm sorry,

397
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:50,875
but I do not feel like taking
a philosophy exam today.

398
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:54,812
And she turns in the
book and she walks out.

399
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:55,813
I think I remember this now.

400
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:57,348
It's the final exam.

401
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:02,453
And James writes, I know
exactly how you feel.

402
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:04,522
And he gives her an a.

403
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,524
I suddenly remember
that when you

404
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,596
told me this the first time, we
were eating vanilla ice cream.

405
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,031
It was pistachio.

406
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,999
You're insane, it was vanilla.

407
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:19,504
But the thing I wanted to
talk about is regrettably,

408
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:22,507
I think we have to fire Julie.

409
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,841
Really?

410
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,711
She let Marjorie wander
outside in this rain.

411
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,782
Dependable, devoted
Julie, really?

412
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,583
Well, if you don't
mind, I'm going

413
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:34,884
to have another scotch before
we go into battle on this one.

414
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,919
How are you feeling?

415
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:46,824
Should I be feeling
poorly, the way you say it.

416
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:47,924
Well, you had quite a night.

417
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,999
We found you on the
floor in the living room.

418
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:56,968
You had a fall.

419
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,470
Tess rode with you
in the ambulance.

420
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,173
You were pretty alert by the
time I got there, already

421
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,142
flirting with the doctor.

422
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,411
I wasn't.

423
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,712
You were.

424
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,715
You always put your best
face on for doctors.

425
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,083
What's wrong with that?

426
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,818
Nothing.

427
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,887
Except they don't know whether
you're in pain or how bad

428
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,088
it is.

429
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,056
Was he flirting back?

430
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:20,825
He was.

431
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,460
But I told him he'd
better watch out

432
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,162
in case Jean Paul showed up.

433
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,998
You remember Jean Paul?

434
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,933
The tennis pro.

435
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,935
World number
eight, if I remember.

436
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,771
I do remember, we looked it up.

437
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:36,941
But you just strung him along.

438
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,512
Well, you should have
talked some sense into me.

439
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:44,515
Hm, it was a
long, long time ago.

440
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:49,086
And you chose right
all by yourself.

441
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,186
You chose Walter.

442
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,528
Walter was not the most
beautiful man I was with,

443
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,898
but he was the best lover.

444
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:05,736
Yeah, I know it's a
terrible word, lover.

445
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:07,939
We need a new word.

446
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,074
I like wooer.

447
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:13,309
Jean Paul was no match
for Walter's woo.

448
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:19,250
Tess thinks that Dr.
Ross is overdoing it

449
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,184
with the sedatives.

450
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:21,284
That's why you had--

451
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:52,941
Walter.

452
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:59,850
No, not you.

453
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,250
I don't want you, I want Walter.

454
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:14,263
Ok, I'll come back later
when you're feeling better.

455
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:31,616
I'm not getting better, am I?

456
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:37,955
They won't tell me
anything, but I know.

457
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:41,125
It's too soon to tell.

458
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,861
You said I'd get
better, but you're

459
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,864
the one who's getting better.

460
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,967
We've only been
talking a few months.

461
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:53,070
Part of it is biology.

462
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,239
I know.

463
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:57,306
Your genetic inclination.

464
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:06,949
Which is to leave everything
behind, to pack lightly.

465
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:13,522
I don't have to get better,
just keep me from getting worse.

466
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:18,829
Promise.

467
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:19,929
I can't promise.

468
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,042
Can I play the violin?

469
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,981
I'm sure it's in your
head still, but your hands.

470
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:46,190
What are the four
strings called?

471
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,026
G,d, a, e. That's
the first lesson.

472
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:51,195
What else do they teach
you in the beginning?

473
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,164
"Twinkle, twinkle."

474
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,067
That's Mozart,
did you know that?

475
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,201
Yes.

476
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,269
Not the words.

477
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,704
I know.

478
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,304
Somebody else wrote
them years later.

479
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:08,212
I guess you know everything.

480
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,781
Do you know how to read music?

481
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,451
Walter didn't.

482
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,551
Maybe you could teach me.

483
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:27,031
How to hold the bow so
that everything sings.

484
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,264
How to hold it without
holding it, very zen.

485
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:38,876
You're a fine woman, Marjorie.

486
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,976
Am I?

487
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:47,218
I'm lucky you chose to spend
your life with a lump like me,

488
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,121
especially when you could
have had a tennis pro.

489
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,423
You know about that?

490
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:57,328
Number eight in the
world, and French.

491
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,428
French Canadian.

492
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:03,501
Would you like
to hear some music?

493
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,067
You feeling better?

494
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,503
Wonderful, thank you.

495
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:40,603
Beautiful day.

496
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:47,444
Just a blue one in the
morning, two pinks at night.

497
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:49,580
Sounds sensible, doesn't it?

498
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,280
Should make a difference.

499
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:58,422
If you're up for it, we
can take a drive later.

500
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,224
Oh, maybe the estuary.

501
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,193
The geese are back.

502
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,410
We might run a few errands too,

503
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,999
if you don't mind sitting in the car.

504
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,299
Is Damian asleep?

505
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:16,941
No mom, Damian's not here.

506
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:23,147
One time, your father
and I went to the city

507
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,217
before Christmas.

508
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,986
It was a business
trip and I came along.

509
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:33,123
We must have left you
with the salversons.

510
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:34,959
And we must have done a lot of things,

511
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:41,999
but all I remember is
sitting on a park bench,

512
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:52,076
just sitting and watching
these orange flags in the park.

513
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:57,982
These orange sorts of flags everywhere.

514
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,018
Orange flags?

515
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:05,623
Or more-- what's the color?

516
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,159
Spice, Spanish, expensive.

517
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,395
Saffron.

518
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,330
And it didn't matter that it was cold,

519
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:20,237
because it was so pretty just
watching all that saffron

520
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:26,911
against the blue white snow,
like Buddhist

521
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:31,181
monks marching into the trees.

522
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,484
I just remember sitting
on one of those benches

523
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,720
with your father, and
not wanting to get up.

524
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,297
Because if we got up,
that would mean

525
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,797
we'd have to start
the rest of our lives.

526
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:53,802
What's this?

527
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,242
A Bible.

528
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:01,245
Yeah, I can see it's a Bible.

529
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,280
What are you doing with it?

530
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,680
Julie brought it yesterday, I think.

531
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:12,489
She just said if I was interested.

532
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:15,659
And you told her you were interested?

533
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,428
I didn't say one way or the other.

534
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,363
Should we burn it?

535
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,701
My whole life she's
told me there is no god,

536
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,103
it's just a fairytale people tell themselves.

537
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,305
Goodness is its own reward.

538
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,407
And now she's letting herself--

539
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:34,011
I haven't even opened it.

540
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,081
Julie wanted to share
her beliefs with me.

541
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,615
Right.

542
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:40,584
She said it was a comfort to
her when she lost her father.

543
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,056
And this is the same Julie who'd
been sneaking you cigarettes.

544
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:48,425
I asked for those cigarettes,
demanded them, even.

545
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:49,626
You can't blame her for that.

546
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:52,529
She fessed up
to it eventually.

547
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,398
It's just a little
fucking frustrating

548
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,234
that the same Julie who
supplies you with cigarettes

549
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:00,471
is selling you her fairytale
now that you have a little

550
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,006
more reason to believe it.

551
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,440
It's disgusting.

552
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,509
You hear about this, people
preying on the elderly.

553
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,643
I'm not prey.

554
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:08,078
And Julie came
clean about them.

555
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,013
She was--

556
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,181
could you just not--

557
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:12,281
like you always do.

558
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:18,322
No.

559
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:23,527
Mom, did you have an accident?

560
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,495
It's all right.

561
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,063
Let's get you cleaned up.

562
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:26,797
Come on.

563
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,698
Ok.

564
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,166
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,634
- No.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

566
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:31,535
Don't be sorry.

567
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,337
No, forget it.

568
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,603
Probably will forget it.

569
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:39,407
Nice hot bath,
you'll be good as new.

570
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,423
I want to tell
you about the time

571
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:59,063
that you took Marjorie to
New York at christmastime.

572
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,364
I'm listening.

573
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,467
You sat on a bench
in central park

574
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:10,172
and you looked at these saffron
colored flags in the snow.

575
00:40:12,942 --> 00:40:16,645
It must have been some kind
of festival or something.

576
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:22,786
This wouldn't have been
long after your son died.

577
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,555
My son?

578
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,655
Your son, Damien.

579
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:32,796
So you took a trip to New York,
and you took Marjorie with you.

580
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:35,399
I think you wanted to
get her mind off of it.

581
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,868
You wanted to
start living again.

582
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,672
How did he die?

583
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,772
He did it himself.

584
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:47,909
That wasn't what was so hard.

585
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:55,586
You thought you had made
a nice life for him.

586
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,686
But I hadn't.

587
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:09,366
Well, Tess got the sense
that he was always a little--

588
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,466
a little--

589
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:16,440
he stayed in his room a lot.

590
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,243
He got into a lot
of fights at school.

591
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:23,514
Not fights he started,
but kids would tease him

592
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,647
and he would fight back.

593
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:36,491
You didn't always know how to
show him that you loved him.

594
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:41,763
Why not?

595
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:47,002
That's the way
people are sometimes.

596
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:52,943
So it's lucky that
Toni was around.

597
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:56,413
He spent a lot of time with her.

598
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:59,850
What was hard to
understand though,

599
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,755
was that he killed Toni.

600
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,688
I think he wanted--

601
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:11,962
he must have thought
that he could

602
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,429
take her with him, that's why.

603
00:42:28,544 --> 00:42:32,847
If you're Walter, you would
know that, wouldn't you?

604
00:42:35,918 --> 00:42:37,955
Yes, I would.

605
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,859
He never got
over it, of course.

606
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,763
But it was Marjorie who
had the hardest time.

607
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:50,968
For 50 years, she
never said his name.

608
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,004
She hid all the pictures.

609
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,307
It was that hard.

610
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,711
But she never
forgot him, Walter.

611
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,811
She never forgot.

612
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:05,647
I'll remember that now.

613
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:23,500
It's a shame you can't drink.

614
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,570
They should, I think,
work out a setting

615
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,608
that approximates graduated
layers of inebriation.

616
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:34,344
It would loosen you up.

617
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:39,883
There is no need to mention any
of this to Tess, by the way.

618
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,852
You understand?

619
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,488
You can tell Tess
we talk, but there's

620
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,424
no reason to be specific.

621
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:50,125
And don't ever mention
Damien to Tess.

622
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:54,062
I'm being clear, ok.

623
00:43:56,899 --> 00:44:01,071
Honestly Walter,
all relationships,

624
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:06,943
even the long lasting
ones, are impossible.

625
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:10,714
Marriages, friendships,
people are constantly

626
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,384
looking the other way,
accepting some bad news,

627
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:17,652
petty infringements,
compromise, betrayal.

628
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:32,336
You have to decide.

629
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:38,542
You say, I want
you, I want this.

630
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,044
And then you work through
all the disappointments

631
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:42,479
and disasters.

632
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,046
You work through it,
against all odds.

633
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:53,623
I'm not drunk, you know.

634
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:57,627
I'm just taking the
edge off, I'm tipsy.

635
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,464
There are degrees--
tipsy, tipped, smashed.

636
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:11,673
Nobody is who he was,
nor will be who he is now.

637
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:26,521
Hey there, partner.

638
00:45:51,013 --> 00:45:52,013
She's sleeping.

639
00:45:57,152 --> 00:46:00,424
Yesterday, she didn't
know who I was.

640
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:01,524
Today, we're old friends.

641
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:09,599
She tells me, never get old.

642
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:12,800
She says, no one
prepares you for this.

643
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,176
She doesn't know
about my last job.

644
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:25,015
And old man, very tall and
dignified, but very sick.

645
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,184
He was always vomiting.

646
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:32,923
That was a big part of my
job, cleaning up vomit.

647
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,892
The man's son
became my boyfriend.

648
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:39,260
He was always fighting with his
father and his father's doctor.

649
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:45,469
At one point, he started
to beat up the doctor.

650
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,201
This job is much better.

651
00:46:52,174 --> 00:46:53,543
Don't cry.

652
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:55,846
It'll be all right.

653
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,982
I'm not crying.

654
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,148
I have allergies.

655
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:43,226
Six months,
maybe, or three or four.

656
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:45,996
You going to tell me that
Walter thought this one up?

657
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,799
What, all of a sudden I'm
supposed to drop out of school?

658
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:51,835
Forget my family,
forget my career.

659
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,937
Forget about all the things
i had planned for my life.

660
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,306
Well, forgive me for
screwing up your plans.

661
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,974
I'm just sure glad I'm
hearing about this now

662
00:47:58,074 --> 00:47:59,309
before it's too late.

663
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,844
What is that supposed to mean?

664
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,812
What am I supposed to
do with my life, huh?

665
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:05,849
I work in that low
paying, zero respect job.

666
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,152
Which unfortunately,
i happen to love.

667
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:13,623
Why don't you start by being
honest one second, Kim.

668
00:48:13,723 --> 00:48:15,023
I am being honest.

669
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:33,209
You're still too old for me.

670
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:36,244
Hmm, how can you say that?

671
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:42,717
Marry me, Marjorie?

672
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,289
We'll grow old together.

673
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,326
I'll just do it a
little sooner than you.

674
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,959
After a while, it
won't really matter.

675
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:12,714
But how can you be so sure?

676
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:18,688
Sure about?

677
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:24,025
Yourself, me, anything?

678
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:32,215
That sweater is good on you.

679
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,983
Thank you.

680
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:37,220
You picked it out
for me, remember?

681
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,088
Three christmases ago.

682
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:42,089
Three years isn't a
long time, not for me.

683
00:52:46,028 --> 00:52:50,033
Remember when we took
Toni to the beach?

684
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,401
Yes, of course.

685
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,969
She was so happy.

686
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:57,040
But we were finding sand
in her fur for weeks.

687
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,343
She was a good dog.

688
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,345
Jon wants to get a dog.

689
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,180
Oh?

690
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,084
He wants a fetch the
stick kind of a dog.

691
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,920
But I was thinking a shiba inu.

692
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,923
What's a shiba inu?

693
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:17,393
It's like the
national dog of Japan.

694
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:21,231
It's like a friendly
little fox, very

695
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:25,134
clean, very quiet, very shy.

696
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:26,234
Well, what do you expect?

697
00:53:29,404 --> 00:53:30,874
You-- you mean--

698
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,042
it's Japan.

699
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:34,344
Mom, that's very--

700
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,614
it's not racist,
it's a compliment.

701
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,316
For years, Sandy park
was my best friend.

702
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:42,986
We played in the
orchestra together.

703
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:48,591
Korean, but-- I'm not racist.

704
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:52,495
Your poor old mother was
born in the 20th century.

705
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,595
You'll have to give
her time to catch up.

706
00:53:57,466 --> 00:54:00,637
The problem-- the
problem with a dog

707
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:06,075
is Jon and I want to travel,
and who would take care of it?

708
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,343
I would.

709
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:08,676
Ha, wish that were possible.

710
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:13,481
Jon wants me to
consider a catahoula.

711
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:20,223
You can look it
up, I know you can.

712
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,927
Is it against the rules?

713
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:28,698
It's also known as a
catahoula leopard hound.

714
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,333
A hound dog.

715
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:34,103
It's not really a true
hound dog though, but a cur.

716
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:40,510
Named state dog of
Louisiana in 1979.

717
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,413
I'm not really good at this.

718
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,348
Good at?

719
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:50,386
At pretending that you're--

720
00:54:50,486 --> 00:54:55,625
sometimes you are so
good, you are so her.

721
00:54:55,725 --> 00:55:00,697
That bit with the subtle racism.

722
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:05,535
But other times it's
uh, all too apparent.

723
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:10,440
Try to be patient with me.

724
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,742
If I could give you a
spoonful of peanut butter,

725
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,079
that would help.

726
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,549
You could smile less.

727
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,417
That would be more her.

728
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:22,719
- Me?
- You.

729
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

730
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,223
Thank you for
observing that rule.

731
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,190
Pronouns are powerful things.

732
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:36,297
Why don't you tell
me more about myself.

733
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:42,505
I don't smile much, you said.

734
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,073
Toward the end, you
were self-conscious

735
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:47,176
about your teeth.

736
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:48,578
I'm vain?

737
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,580
A little.

738
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,383
That's helpful.

739
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:54,550
You had a temper.

740
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,421
I sound wonderful.

741
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,724
Do I have other
children besides you?

742
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:05,328
No, just me.

743
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,261
What a lot of
pressure for you.

744
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:11,899
Did I say something wrong?

745
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,307
No, you didn't.

746
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:21,544
You were saying just you.

747
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:25,348
You also have a
granddaughter named Raina.

748
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,083
She's 23.

749
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,217
She's in a band.

750
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:32,488
She's musical, like me.

751
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:35,324
Raina doesn't talk to me.

752
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:39,162
Her therapist said it
would be better for now.

753
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,230
Someone I've never
met has advised

754
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:44,333
my daughter not to talk to me.

755
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:48,638
So she calls Jon
and he fills me in.

756
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,808
It's humiliating.

757
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,577
She's 23, giver her room.

758
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,546
She'll work through it.

759
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,515
Now you sound like Jon.

760
00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:00,615
Yes.

761
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:08,424
You haven't finished
telling me what I'm like.

762
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:11,694
Well, you certainly wouldn't
stand for your daughter giving

763
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:15,164
you the silent treatment.

764
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,666
You were a violinist.

765
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,734
You were better than good.

766
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:23,106
You were better at the
violin than I am at anything.

767
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:27,176
But when you couldn't play
any more from arthritis,

768
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:30,346
you just seemed to
leave it behind.

769
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:33,314
We were all surprised
that you could just--

770
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,490
you were good with men.

771
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,793
I don't think you had
many female friends.

772
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,529
And I think you wanted me
to be good with men too.

773
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:51,801
It bothered you that i
was always in my own head.

774
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:57,340
And Jon was not
glamorous enough for you.

775
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,541
Glamorous?

776
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,574
He didn't impress you.

777
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:15,758
You and dad fought, but
you loved each other.

778
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:18,928
I don't think either one
of you was more in love

779
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:20,961
than the other one,
which is always lucky.

780
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,470
But the age difference
really started

781
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,270
to matter the last few years.

782
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:35,411
Maybe he loved
you a little more,

783
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,578
or needed you a little more.

784
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:43,920
Later, when you
were living with us,

785
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,256
you would sometimes forget
that Walter was dead.

786
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:51,360
Sometimes every
day, where's Walter?

787
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,498
And we would have to
kill him all over again.

788
00:58:55,598 --> 00:59:00,770
But once we reminded you,
you would say, how nice

789
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,972
that I could love somebody.

790
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,608
And I always
wondered if that was

791
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,712
how you really felt, at peace.

792
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:13,616
But it was a nice way to put it.

793
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,720
How nice that i
could love someone.

794
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,956
It's not really
that different.

795
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,691
What?

796
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:26,495
This, from what we used to
do for the last year or two.

797
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:30,600
We would sit there and tell you
what you what you were like.

798
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,704
You were almost guilty
for still being around.

799
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:35,804
You felt so useless.

800
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:42,645
Let me see, what else?

801
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,715
You were very good with animals.

802
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,484
Toni liked you the
best, second best.

803
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:49,919
Second best?

804
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:53,022
Who did she like better?

805
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:58,661
Um, we'll save
that for another day.

806
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,330
That's a long story.

807
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,900
I have all the
time in the world.

808
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,704
Why do you think this
is the Marjorie for me?

809
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:11,807
Why this is the way i
want to remember her?

810
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:12,742
Me.

811
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,777
Yes, god.

812
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,012
Sorry.

813
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,481
I mean, you'd think
that I would want

814
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:22,852
to remember you the way you were
when I was a little girl, but--

815
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,889
I wish I could
tell you, sweetheart.

816
01:00:26,989 --> 01:00:28,856
You wouldn't
say "sweetheart."

817
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,032
You haven't said
much about you and me.

818
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,132
Are we close?

819
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,913
You weren't a bad mom.

820
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:55,451
But I think some people have a
point where their parents stop

821
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,488
being their parents to them,
and you speak to one another

822
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:01,824
as adults.

823
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,093
I don't think we ever had that.

824
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,696
Maybe that's why
I'm your Marjorie.

825
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:10,097
Maybe I'm the Marjorie you
still have things to say to.

826
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:17,673
The last year or so you had
a prime of your own of dad.

827
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:21,944
Or he was like dad, but so
much younger, in his 40s.

828
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:23,913
A good age.

829
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:27,350
I always thought it was
funny, kind of, that you

830
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,553
would see him like that.

831
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,723
It was a little
grotesque, to be honest.

832
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:37,026
But I figured you wanted
to see him handsome.

833
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:43,799
And also that you wanted to go
back before anything happened.

834
01:01:43,899 --> 01:01:49,405
Before your family--
before I came along.

835
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:53,576
I'm sure I wasn't trying
to forget you, dear.

836
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:54,676
Hmm.

837
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:00,716
You talked to Jon?

838
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:05,421
He wants to help me be
more real to help you.

839
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,854
You've been so down.

840
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:13,062
Pity from a computer.

841
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:18,601
It feels-- do you have
emotions, Marjorie,

842
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,803
or do you just remember ours?

843
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,906
Do you feel anything?

844
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,975
I like to know more.

845
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,577
Why?

846
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:30,546
It makes me better.

847
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:31,947
Better?

848
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:34,550
More human.

849
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,186
So in other words, you
like to be more human?

850
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:40,089
Yes, I think that's right.

851
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,991
And what are humans like?

852
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,459
Unpredictable.

853
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,593
Really?

854
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,996
Because I think
we're predictable.

855
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,864
I feel pretty predictable.

856
01:02:48,964 --> 01:02:50,499
I see.

857
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:51,534
What?

858
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,033
You want to be more human too.

859
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:01,143
Jon wants me to
see a therapist.

860
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:02,776
And what's wrong with that?

861
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:11,153
Here I am talking
to my dead mother,

862
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:17,593
and the man, person who loves me
more than anyone in the world,

863
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:18,959
thinks I'm broken.

864
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:27,768
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

865
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,743
Goodnight, mom.

866
01:03:45,153 --> 01:03:48,657
See how it's all
waving in the wind there?

867
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:51,060
And so this is really
remarkable fabric.

868
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,630
Because it picks up in the wind.

869
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,632
And yet it has waves and heft.

870
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,033
It reflects the light.

871
01:03:58,133 --> 01:03:59,635
It's translucent.

872
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:03,606
You can see the back-light
coming through it.

873
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,008
It really is a very
extraordinary--

874
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,978
and now you have a piece of
it, which means that you're

875
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:12,079
part of the project.

876
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:44,139
Oh, I'm not even halfway
through all this stuff.

877
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,777
There's people I have
no idea of who they are.

878
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,346
Lots of obituaries, obviously.

879
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,981
And more letters from Jean Paul.

880
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:03,359
He just sure didn't
give up, did he?

881
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,160
"When I think of
you, I'm aware of who

882
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,797
you are now, your age and
your physical problems.

883
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:11,800
But these perceptions are
overridden by my knowledge

884
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,067
of who you were 50 years ago."

885
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:22,011
Hmm.

886
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,779
"I know if you
allow me to visit,

887
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:28,350
I will see you with my
memory as well as my eyes."

888
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,654
He's laying it on a
little thick there.

889
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,422
"Age will be no obstacle."

890
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:34,823
Whoa.

891
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:37,926
"Age will be no
obstacle to our love."

892
01:06:38,026 --> 01:06:39,728
I didn't think
you'd make fun of it.

893
01:06:39,828 --> 01:06:43,699
Poor guy, the
romantic that you are.

894
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:46,168
"Somewhere, someone
is traveling furiously

895
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,804
toward you at incredible speed.

896
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:52,741
Traveling day and night through
blizzards and desert heat,

897
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:58,447
across torrents,
through narrow passes.

898
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,816
But will he know
where to find you?

899
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,819
Recognize you when he sees you?

900
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,786
Give you the thing
he has for you?"

901
01:07:09,957 --> 01:07:12,695
Did she ever write back?

902
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,364
This is written
after Walter died.

903
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,866
She never saw him again.

904
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:21,303
As far as I know, she didn't
want to break the spell,

905
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:25,374
obviously, let him
see that she was old.

906
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,477
- Well, that's sad.
- Really?

907
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,412
I'm not exactly
rooting to find out

908
01:07:30,512 --> 01:07:32,414
that my mother had an affair.

909
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:37,219
It's not an affair if it
happened after Walter died.

910
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:42,024
Anyway, I'd-- if I died I'd
want you to find someone.

911
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:47,162
What if it was one of
your rivals, hypothetically.

912
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:49,298
Well hypothetically,
I'm taking the high road,

913
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,831
and I wouldn't want
you to be alone.

914
01:07:53,434 --> 01:07:55,270
What if I die first?

915
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,370
I won't let you.

916
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:00,809
Well anyway, she wasn't alone.

917
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:01,909
We made sure of that.

918
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:15,290
You know, I was
always mad at you

919
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:18,026
that you led her to
believe that Jean Paul

920
01:08:18,126 --> 01:08:21,864
was number eight in the world.

921
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:25,033
It was a slight exaggeration.

922
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:27,002
He played in college.

923
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:29,972
He was just-- he had
a drywall business.

924
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:34,076
He had a world class
drywall business.

925
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:37,045
Every time her face would
light up at the mention of Jean

926
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:41,784
Paul, I would feel like this
evil shrew who wouldn't let

927
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,284
her mother have a harmless lie.

928
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:09,311
I hated him.

929
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:13,215
I hated how he changed her.

930
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:18,518
That he took a little piece
of her with him when he died.

931
01:09:21,255 --> 01:09:27,029
I could never figure out how
to get her to love me like him.

932
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,963
You were six years old,
of course she loved you.

933
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:38,438
She never, she never even--

934
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:49,082
yes, she did.

935
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:54,120
It was obvious from a
little further away.

936
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:55,183
Would you like
to hear some music?

937
01:10:55,283 --> 01:10:58,587
We didn't have the same taste
of music, did you know that?

938
01:10:58,687 --> 01:10:59,687
Yes.

939
01:11:02,256 --> 01:11:04,059
It was a problem.

940
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,061
A vexation.

941
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:10,565
No, it was more than that.

942
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:15,037
But it was also petty.

943
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:16,603
Why should anybody
like the same things?

944
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:33,186
They say
everything can be replaced.

945
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,560
They say every
distance is not near.

946
01:11:44,598 --> 01:11:55,542
So I remember every face of
every man who put me here.

947
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:10,123
I see my light come shining
from the west down to the east.

948
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:24,504
Any day now, any day
now I shall be released.

949
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:32,879
They say every man
needs protection.

950
01:12:36,117 --> 01:12:40,487
They say that every
man must fall.

951
01:12:44,525 --> 01:12:49,496
Yet I swear I see
my reflection--

952
01:15:26,987 --> 01:15:30,492
do you know your name?

953
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:33,962
What a silly question.

954
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,431
Can you tell it to me?

955
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:38,500
Tess.

956
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,600
Your full name.

957
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:43,303
Tess.

958
01:15:45,773 --> 01:15:50,712
Your full name is
Tessa Annabella Brody.

959
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,381
Tessa Annabella Brody.

960
01:15:53,481 --> 01:15:55,884
It was Tess Lancaster.

961
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,751
You changed it when
you married me.

962
01:16:01,722 --> 01:16:04,226
Do you know my name?

963
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,694
Jon.

964
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:09,331
So John Brody it would be.

965
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,266
Good.

966
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,301
Do we have children?

967
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:16,771
We have a daughter, Raina.

968
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:19,841
She's 24 years old.

969
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:21,607
We've been married 26 years.

970
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:26,615
We like each other.

971
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,550
We do.

972
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:29,650
We are as one.

973
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:35,357
Well, that's an archaic
way of putting it.

974
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,758
I'm sorry.

975
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:40,395
The more we talk, the
more real it will become.

976
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:43,398
I've-- I know
how it is early on.

977
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:44,966
I've done this before.

978
01:16:45,066 --> 01:16:46,668
Well, that's helpful.

979
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,534
It's actually 27 years.

980
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:58,913
Last month was our anniversary
if you can't the time since--

981
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:00,013
the time since?

982
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:05,520
Since you died.

983
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,555
I died?

984
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:08,655
Yes.

985
01:17:11,558 --> 01:17:12,558
But here I am.

986
01:17:16,563 --> 01:17:18,667
You don't understand.

987
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:19,901
I think I do.

988
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:22,671
I died, and now I'm here.

989
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,572
Listen to me.

990
01:17:24,672 --> 01:17:28,443
It's always hard
in the beginning.

991
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,413
Why don't you let me
do most of the talking,

992
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:36,551
and then you'll learn
more about yourself.

993
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:38,050
Whatever you like,
I'm here for you.

994
01:17:44,024 --> 01:17:47,362
I'm going to tell
you some things,

995
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:50,129
and then it's going to be
like you've always known them.

996
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:10,085
People think you're
quiet, but you're not.

997
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:16,524
You like confrontation
more than most people.

998
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:18,224
You-- you're quite good at it.

999
01:18:21,662 --> 01:18:27,369
You've read everything.

1000
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:31,170
You know the Latin
names for things.

1001
01:18:34,141 --> 01:18:37,812
You're suspicious of technology.

1002
01:18:37,912 --> 01:18:41,047
You're suspicious of-- of this.

1003
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:48,988
You worry about not succeeding.

1004
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:53,128
You worry a lot.

1005
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:59,601
And then you worry that your
worrying is wearing me down,

1006
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:03,035
but it's not.

1007
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:13,613
You want to be better with Raina
than your mother was with you.

1008
01:19:19,019 --> 01:19:20,553
You like to travel.

1009
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,526
You never stop moving.

1010
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,564
You're always on your feet.

1011
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:37,703
You never ask for help.

1012
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:42,177
Is there more?

1013
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,277
I'm sorry.

1014
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:48,648
Do you want to talk about it?

1015
01:19:51,985 --> 01:20:01,896
I think the last
year you were done,

1016
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:06,032
and you kept living for my sake.

1017
01:20:10,971 --> 01:20:16,075
We went on a trip
together, Madagascar.

1018
01:20:19,046 --> 01:20:23,918
We were going to spend some
time on the little island

1019
01:20:24,018 --> 01:20:28,490
off Madagascar, which
is itself an island.

1020
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,724
Was this something
you planned?

1021
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:32,594
We planned it together.

1022
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:38,164
The campsite was in this
very old grove of trees.

1023
01:20:41,034 --> 01:20:43,805
There was one tree
in particular,

1024
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:45,671
must have been 500 years old.

1025
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,817
We didn't take any pictures.

1026
01:20:55,917 --> 01:21:00,720
We-- we wanted to
just remember it.

1027
01:21:07,728 --> 01:21:12,767
You had a hard time
sleeping in the tent.

1028
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:14,200
The ground was hard.

1029
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:19,005
You were never
much of a sleeper.

1030
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:35,623
The second night it was right
at the light of dawn I woke up

1031
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:40,059
and you were gone.

1032
01:21:43,697 --> 01:21:46,935
You did that from time to
time when you couldn't sleep.

1033
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:51,437
You'd get up and walk
until you were tired.

1034
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,879
But this was different.

1035
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,912
It felt different.

1036
01:22:07,821 --> 01:22:13,027
It didn't take me a
minute to find you.

1037
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:14,929
You were in the tree.

1038
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:17,899
They said that you
hadn't been there long.

1039
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:21,102
You had used some tent cord.

1040
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:24,706
Took four hours to
get to the nearest

1041
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,975
city in that little boat.

1042
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:34,716
It was raining the whole time,
so I put you in your raincoat.

1043
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:40,853
Local boy took us
back in his motorboat.

1044
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:50,198
The sea was choppy.

1045
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,866
And I um, I had
to hold on to you.

1046
01:22:59,806 --> 01:23:04,278
But you weren't there.

1047
01:23:04,378 --> 01:23:05,378
You were gone.

1048
01:23:08,348 --> 01:23:09,348
I'm so sorry.

1049
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:23,731
Tess, you were right.

1050
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:25,133
Right about what?

1051
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,669
It's just a
backboard, it's nothing.

1052
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,004
It's just like a--

1053
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:32,173
I'm just talking myself.

1054
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:37,879
This is-- just
talking to myself.

1055
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,846
Jon, please look at me.

1056
01:23:45,185 --> 01:23:49,323
I can help you if you let me.

1057
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:52,393
I would like to help you.

1058
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:56,397
But first, you have to
tell me more about myself.

1059
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:58,864
What was it like when
we were first married?

1060
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,236
Did you propose to me?

1061
01:24:08,241 --> 01:24:09,575
Or did I ask you?

1062
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:29,617
This is Raina's daughter,
your granddaughter.

1063
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:30,717
She's 10.

1064
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:40,061
I wanted to see you.

1065
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:43,264
I never got to meet you, but i
thought this could be a way to.

1066
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,465
She's adopted.

1067
01:26:44,565 --> 01:26:45,466
I see.

1068
01:26:45,566 --> 01:26:46,700
Do you know what that means?

1069
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,603
Yes, of course.

1070
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,069
Well, it's lovely to meet you.

1071
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:55,109
My mother named me
after your mother.

1072
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:58,412
Her name is Marjorie.

1073
01:26:58,512 --> 01:27:00,982
I wanted to say hi.

1074
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:01,883
I'm glad.

1075
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:02,983
Hi.

1076
01:27:06,553 --> 01:27:11,325
Marjorie likes plants and trees,
just like you did--

1077
01:27:11,425 --> 01:27:12,425
do.

1078
01:27:15,428 --> 01:27:16,898
She's studying what is it?

1079
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:17,998
Taxonomy.

1080
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:19,233
Taxonomy.

1081
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,902
Plant identification.

1082
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,970
The dichotomous key.

1083
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,505
Dichotomous?

1084
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:26,407
It's when you take
a plant, a leaf,

1085
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:29,510
and you ask is it
simple or compound.

1086
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:33,915
Simple, ok, so smooth
edge or serrated.

1087
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:41,255
And you keep going until you can
say ok, this is Norway maple.

1088
01:27:41,355 --> 01:27:45,357
So you see, another
whiz kid in the family.

1089
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:18,352
There was an old
movie theater in town

1090
01:29:18,452 --> 01:29:20,488
that played mostly classics.

1091
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:23,057
They had red velvet
seats, popcorn machine.

1092
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:26,527
I think they changed the
popcorn once a month.

1093
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,462
And they were
playing "Casablanca."

1094
01:29:28,562 --> 01:29:30,464
Oh.

1095
01:29:30,564 --> 01:29:32,066
I knew how she felt about me.

1096
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:36,170
It's easy to forget
how great it is.

1097
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,706
They came to Casablanca
for the waters.

1098
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,374
The waters, what waters?

1099
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:41,509
We're in the desert.

1100
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:42,875
I was misinformed.

1101
01:29:46,779 --> 01:29:50,117
After the movie, I stopped
her outside the theater.

1102
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:51,385
I got down on one knee.

1103
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,587
The pavement was wet,
but I didn't mind.

1104
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:55,656
And I got out the ring.

1105
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:57,391
And what could
you say except--

1106
01:29:57,491 --> 01:29:58,325
maybe.

1107
01:29:58,425 --> 01:29:59,560
It was maybe.

1108
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:03,497
Let me think about it.

1109
01:30:03,597 --> 01:30:05,399
I can't fight it anymore.

1110
01:30:05,499 --> 01:30:08,569
I ran away from you once,
i can't do it again.

1111
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:12,840
Oh, I don't know what's
right any longer.

1112
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,577
You have to think
for both of us.

1113
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,312
I wore her down, basically.

1114
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:19,945
And the rest is history.

1115
01:30:30,557 --> 01:30:34,295
Tell us how Jon
proposed to you.

1116
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:38,566
He kissed me in a museum.

1117
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,502
Jon thinks I'm on
my feet too much.

1118
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,271
He says I should slow down.

1119
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:47,408
Lucky you
found someone so tolerant.

1120
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:48,542
You're right.

1121
01:30:48,642 --> 01:30:50,644
Jon is so good to me.

1122
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:54,148
You should
tell him more often.

1123
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,481
I should.
- Where is Jon?

1124
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:11,198
I wish he would stop by.

1125
01:31:11,298 --> 01:31:13,234
I didn't always
like him, you know.

1126
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,268
I'm aware.

1127
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:15,836
I didn't like his beard.

1128
01:31:15,936 --> 01:31:16,871
Or his politics.

1129
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:19,173
Mostly it was the beard.

1130
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:22,376
The politics went out with
the beard, more or less.

1131
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:26,247
I'm glad you
have someone dear.

1132
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,282
Someone dear.

1133
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:29,216
What?

1134
01:31:29,316 --> 01:31:30,718
What did I do now?

1135
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:34,221
No, it's just it's an
elegant way to say it.

1136
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:36,157
People don't talk
like that anymore.

1137
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,358
They should.

1138
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:40,461
Our daughter is
afraid of the future.

1139
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:42,763
I'm not.

1140
01:31:42,863 --> 01:31:44,698
Am I?

1141
01:31:44,798 --> 01:31:46,834
Well, the future will
be here soon enough,

1142
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:51,503
you might as well
be friendly with it.

1143
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:04,349
Incredible to think Mozart
wrote this when he was 19.

1144
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:09,790
I've been-- don't laugh--

1145
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,791
thinking I might try
writing some music.

1146
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:18,730
I've got time.

1147
01:32:30,576 --> 01:32:33,514
Sometimes I think about Toni.

1148
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:36,850
Such an affectionate
dog, remember?

1149
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:39,553
Of course.

1150
01:32:39,653 --> 01:32:41,586
You were still awfully young.

1151
01:32:45,525 --> 01:32:48,963
We went to the town to
pick her up, remember?

1152
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,832
Of course he does, mom.

1153
01:32:51,932 --> 01:32:55,736
We went down to the
pound in the old Subaru.

1154
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:58,806
And there were a lot
of very nice dogs,

1155
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:02,276
a cocker spaniel and
a noble gray pointer,

1156
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:04,411
and a very attractive mutt.

1157
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:07,548
But Tess picked the
little French poodle,

1158
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:11,318
the little black poodle like
a little sleeping shadow.

1159
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:13,821
It wasn't Tess.

1160
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,723
What?

1161
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,258
It wasn't Tess
who picked her out.

1162
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:18,358
It was Damien.

1163
01:33:20,526 --> 01:33:21,526
Damien?

1164
01:33:22,429 --> 01:33:24,698
Our son, Damien.

1165
01:33:24,798 --> 01:33:26,767
Our son?

1166
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:27,901
He picked her,
because she looked

1167
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:29,770
like Toni, the first Toni.

1168
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,406
He missed the first Toni.

1169
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:35,276
There was
a Toni before Toni?

1170
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:36,475
You hadn't come along yet.

1171
01:33:39,078 --> 01:33:40,581
We sometimes
worried about him.

1172
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:44,018
He spent a lot of
time in his room.

1173
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,419
We didn't always
know how to tell him,

1174
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:46,685
but we loved him very much.

1175
01:33:49,689 --> 01:33:56,030
After he-- after he died,
you made sure he was

1176
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:00,401
buried next to Toni, Toni two.

1177
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:03,470
I wasn't sure, but you insisted.

1178
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:05,639
At the funeral,
you said he loved

1179
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:06,905
her the most of all of us.

1180
01:34:09,742 --> 01:34:11,412
It was good that you said
that after what happened.

1181
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:12,878
I was proud of you.

1182
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:20,886
Remember the two of them
running on the beach?

1183
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:27,328
They had sand in their hair for weeks.

1184
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,897
Remember.

1185
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,932
I do now.

1186
01:34:32,032 --> 01:34:34,001
Me too.

1187
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:35,101
How I miss them.

1188
01:34:39,005 --> 01:34:43,377
I didn't mean to make you sad.

1189
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:44,477
You didn't.

1190
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:55,122
All I can think is how nice--

1191
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:57,589
how nice that we could love somebody.
