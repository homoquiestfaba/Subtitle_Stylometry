He's here, Georgie.

188
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,408

193
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,450
- What's the matter?

194
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,553
- What is he doing here?

195
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,554

Who's here?

197
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,157

The First Horn is here.

199
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,762

200
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,364
- He's in New Orleans.

201
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,433
I knew he'd come back.

202
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,336

203
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,471

Is that a new Dixie Land Band?

Oh thank you for this favor.

It's been years for me.

227
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,379
I've been trying to find him.

I'ma check you later then, okay?

239
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,595
- Wait, George.

240
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,463
Bring this to the desk

241
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,399
and tell them it's for the First Horn.

242
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,934
- [George] Oh, all right.

243
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,035
I'ma see you later?

244
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,937
- Okay, Georgie Porgie.

245
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,114
- Aight now, you make me
cut you, motherfucker.

246
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:28,948
- That's your problem.

247
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,249
You always wanna cut somebody.

248
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,083
- That's right.

249
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,917
That why I wear black.

250
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,752
It's a good day for killing.

251
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,320
- I see you kill motherfuckers
in other colors, too.

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,455
- So you know I'll cut your ass.

253
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,923
- Look at this drunk motherfucker here.

254
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,260
- Ah man, fucking homeless.

255
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,829
- Hey, how you doing?

256
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,663
- All right.

257
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,265
- I have a message

258
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,002
for a Mr. F. Horn.

259
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,371
(gentle music)

260
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,205
- Yeah, he's here.

261
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,440
I'll take it, thanks.

262
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,741
- All right.

263
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,812
Say bro, you can spare
a little change, huh?

264
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,646
Just a little.
- Get out of here.

265
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,580
Go, go.

266
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,150
(gentle music)

267
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,790
- Man, what's up, bro?

268
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,824
What's happening?

269
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,691
What's happening?

270
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,826
Aw no.

271
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,495
(ominous music)

272
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,066
- Hey, Fat-Dough Boy.

273
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:21,567
- Hold up bro.

274
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,168
Hold up.

275
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,169
What you want, man?

276
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,003
- [Jim] What's the message, man?

277
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,070
- What message, man?

278
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,071
- I seen the envelope.

279
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,072
What was inside?

280
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,240
- Say bro, it was a picture.

281
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,509
It was a picture of a baby, bro.

282
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,444
The girl gave me $5 to
bring it to the front desk.

283
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,679
- Man, fuck this bum.

284
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,014
Let's kill this motherfucker.

285
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:35,848
- Wait, wait, wait, don't kill him.

286
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:36,682
Don't kill him.

287
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,516
- No, no, no, fuck him, fuck him.

288
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,350
- Say man, no.

289
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,952
Bro, I'm telling the truth, bro.

290
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,020
I'm telling the truth, man.

291
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,854
Hold up.

292
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,688
Hold up.

293
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,522
- Fuck that.

294
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,024
- Oh no, don't do it.

295
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,058
- Shit, look what you did.

296
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:46,892
- [Jules] Boy, I ain't never saw

297
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,561
a motherfucker bleed like that.

298
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,395
Shit.

299
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,063
- [Jim] Goddamn, fat ass dough boy.

300
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,732
(ominous music)

301
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,672
- [Lucinda] Aw, love that George.

302
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,909
(bright music)

303
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,912
(gentle music)

304
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,496
(glass shattering)

305
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,099
(gentle music)

306
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,339
- Let's keep it simple
and not have any rules.

307
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,673
There's less confusion that way.

308
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,976
- Don't you remember what happened in '83?

309
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,178
Dennis Proctor was dismembered.

310
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,046
- You mean somebody cut off his phallus?

311
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,014
- Not his dick.

312
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,349
Duh, dildo-brain.

313
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,084
Do you never think about anything else?

314
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,986
- [Betsy] You just said
they cut off his member.

315
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:47,953
- Dismember.

316
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,488
Torn limb from limb.

317
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,490
Ouch, she is so dumb.

318
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,893
- You see Beatrice, we have to have rules.

319
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,162
Before you know it, it will
be a spit of penis stuff

320
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,666
and we'll have a massive
witch hunt on our ass.

321
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,435
- Nobody is going to chop off
some poor schmuck's wonker

322
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,937
and grind it into spell powder.

323
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,006
- That's right because
it'll be against the rules.

324
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,941
First rule, no male extremities.

325
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,909
Write it down, Betsy.

326
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,644
- Next you'll be inviting
animal activists in

327
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,346
to make sure we don't use
any bat wings or sheep pies.

328
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,314
- Don't be ridiculous.

329
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,148
Rule number two.

330
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,484
No fraternizing with the
First Horn before the contest.

331
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,420
- What are we trying to
do eliminate shitting?

332
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,056
- What if he's the one that
wants to start the fraternizing?

333
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,492
- You don't have to worry about that.

334
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,660
Believe me.

335
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,861
- Third and final rule.

336
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,063
There will be no spells
cast from this day forward

337
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,498
until it's time for the contest.

338
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,034
We can't have anyone jinxing
anyone else's chances

339
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,402
or hexing up the airwaves.

340
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,103
- That's a ridiculous rule.

341
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,406
No one is gonna keep
me from using my magic.

342
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,274
- Anyone caught cheating
will be disqualified

343
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,276
from the contest and
suspended from the coven

344
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,378
for a year including you Beatrice.

345
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,381
You got all that, Betsy?

346
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,016
- Scribed in blood.

347
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,152
- Ha, that is a laugh.

348
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,887
I would like to see any one of you try

349
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,488
to keep me away from the coven.

350
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,591
(box thudding)

351
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,060
Oh yuck.

352
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,461
It's the whore.

353
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,964
(eerie music)

354
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,435
- Whore to you too, Beatrice.

355
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,303
- What are you crawling around for?

356
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,440
Looking for a spell to cure your V.D.?

357
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,543
- I think we all know who's
carrying the fungi around here.

358
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,511
Do you all have your gloves on?

359
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,413
Look, you know why I've come.

360
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,815
What is he doing here?

361
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,782
- What's it to you?

362
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,317
Spread your legs?

363
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,720
Membership to this coven
is not open to whores.

364
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,223
- You're being mean to me.

365
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,361
Look you fat inflamed vaginal wart,

366
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,864
I don't care about your
stupid puberty club.

367
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,734
I just want to know what he's doing here.

368
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:46,005
- Well actually Lucinda, if it
hasn't escaped your attention

369
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,008
it is the eve of Beltane,
the sacred night of love,

370
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,044
and the First Horn has to choose
a mate for the celebration.

371
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,779
- Choose a mate?

372
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,582
How, who?

373
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,218
- Whoever can cast the
most powerful spell.

374
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,486
Me of course.

375
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,021
Fangs up.

376
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,822
- Don't count your wrinkles, Beatrice.

377
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,691
There's more to fancy spell casting

378
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,693
than dollin' for foundation and mascara.

379
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,195
- Shut up you fat slut.

380
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,864
He'd never fuck you for solstice.

381
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,833
- You cheesy, smelly cunt.

382
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,335
- More repugnant than gorgonzola.

383
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,169
What a whiff?

384
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,208
Lucinda, nice of you to stop by,

385
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,078
and ah, give my regards to your pimp.

386
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:27,880
- Eh?

387
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,518
Eh?

388
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,452
Hey Beatrice, wonk.

389
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,422
And wonk.

390
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,427
Hey, how's your cheese factor?

391
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,561
Cheesy, baby.

392
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,533
- You virus stricken whore.

393
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,068
- You're scaring me.

394
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,403
Oh God, you guys are scaring me.

395
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,906
(eerie music)

396
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,476
You know what?

397
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,911
I think I'm gonna go to the friend's store

398
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,179
and get some new friends.

399
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,649
And a whore to you, too.

400
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,286
(eerie music)

401
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,894
- Lucinda Bale.

402
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,629
I know her little secret.

403
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,933
I will fix her now.

404
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,368
Vision light.

405
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,771
Vision bright.

406
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,739
- You can't do that.

407
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,942
You can't cast a spell on another witch.

408
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,009
- She's not a witch.

409
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,845
She is a whore.

410
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,214
One little spell is not going to hurt.

411
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,983
Go on, Beatrice, fry the bitch.

412
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,384
- Vision light.

413
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,054
Vision bright.

414
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:47,192
Foul up the First Horn's sight.

415
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,796
Lay his eyes upon Lucinda Bale

416
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:57,703
and all he'll see is a scabby veil.

417
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,908
- Hm.

418
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,243
A spell contest.

419
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:45,083
(singing in foreign language)

420
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,886
- Artos.

421
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,091
Spirit guide, it's about fucking time.

422
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:53,992
Come on, Artos.

423
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,461
I'm not in the mood for this crap.

424
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,464
- So Jason, it's nearly
the eve of the Beltane.

425
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,035
You must be fairly excited
to have sex without a condom.

426
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,236
- Cut the shite.

427
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,605
Do you not get laid in the spirit world?

428
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,275
- Beyond your wildest dreams, sonny boy.

429
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,213
So what's the problem, women, again?

430
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,214
- Just one woman.

431
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,216
That bitch Beatrice.

432
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,152
You know she's gonna win
the bloody spell contest.

433
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,888
- [Artos] But didn't you
say she gives good head?

434
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,323
- That's not a good enough reason

435
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,058
to have a child with a woman.

436
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,660
I'm trying to be serious about all this

437
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,963
and she's a fucking nightmare.

438
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,367
- A horny fucking nightmare.

439
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,936
A First Horn nightmare.

440
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:43,375
It's your duty to father,
nurture and train a son

441
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,212
to carry on the legacy
of your ancestor Merlin

442
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,880
or it will be lost forever.

443
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,718
- I don't want the shite
responsibility on my head anymore.

444
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,720
It's driving me fucking nuts.

445
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,657
- Too many undesirables know
about your enchanted bloodline.

446
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,993
You need some earthly protection.

447
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,861
Try this.

448
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,563
Jesse James did.

449
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,298
- You must be out of your mind.

450
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,835
You know every time I'm
violent I lose power.

451
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,537
This should not be the way of the druids.

452
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,241
- Promiscuity also cost you power druid.

453
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,512
If you spend less time screwing
and more time on the magic,

454
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,180
you wouldn't need a gun.

455
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,084
- I'll take love and whatever
shape or form it comes in.

456
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:30,088
What I do not need is you
encouraging me to be violent.

457
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,723
- The preservation of knowledge

458
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,294
and culture are two
things worth fighting for.

459
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,131
Listen to the voice of
your own conscience.

460
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,666

461
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,267
Wait.

462
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,070
What do I do about Beatrice?

463
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,206
- [Artos] Necessity is
the mother of invention.

464
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,432
- Did the First Horn check in today?

465
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,366

466
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,734

468
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,072

even know his real name.

469
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,273

00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,017
Do you mind if I say a wee prayer?

597
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:46,851

Looks like you made a mess after all.

605
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,336
- You son of a bitch.

606
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,805
You used your magic shit.

607
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,307
- That's right.

608
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,642
I prayed I wouldn't hit you in the head

609
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,945

610
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,949

Oh, it was so fine.

00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,494
I just wanna do it again.

621
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,038

622
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,140
It's all so simple.

623
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,876
Why'd I never think of it?

624
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,944
Blow their fucking brains out.

625
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:24,215
Why don't you blow your
own fucking brains out?

626
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,451
You fucking idiot.

627
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,253

I'm a fucking moron.

629
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,357
No.

630
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,191
Oh no.

631
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,793
What'd I do that for?

632
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,930
It's all good.

633
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,900

634
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,336
Fucking just fine, that is.

635
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,071
Oh God.

636
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,741
Oh no, it's keeping on my back.

637
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,442
Oh no.

00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,111

640
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,017
Here take it.

641
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,284
- I don't want your money.

642
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,185
- Well take it.

643
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,587
Business is business.

644
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,191
- But it's different.

645
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,342
- So what's your name anyway?

646
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,078
- Necessity.

647
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,079
- Necessity?

648
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,650
Necessity.

649
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,653
Necessity.

650
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,823
Why did I not get it the first time?

652
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,116
- Welcome to Minerva's Den.

653
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,251
- Thank you.

654
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,422
- [Madame] Chickory, remember
the gentleman's coat.

655

Does a girl named
Necessity still work here?

663
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,879
- The girls tend to change their names

664
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,748
quite frequently around
here, but look around.

665
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,950
You might recognize her.

666
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,086
- Aye, but it was seven or eight years ago

667
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:26,524
during the Mardi Gras and
she was wearing a mask.

668
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,993

Very lovely, bend over.

677
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:54,986
It's not you.

678

Oh my God, is it you?

679
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,294
- [Woman] I'm Necessity.

680
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,195

681
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,029

683
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:10,935
No.

684
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,036
It's not you either.

685
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:13,971
Anybody?

686
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,206
- Would you like to see?

687
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,207
- I'd like to see.

688
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,041
I'd love to see.

689
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,310
Oh, let me see.

690

692
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,357
Oh my darling.

693
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,926
Let me have a look at you.

694
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,028
Perhaps it is.

695
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,698
No, it's not you.

696
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,503
Is there a Necessity amongst you all?

697
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,672
- [Woman] Necessity is me.

698
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,511
- She was a little taller,
but I think I'll look anyway.

699
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,679
No, it's not you.

700
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,447
How 'bout you?

701
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,748
Perhaps it was you.

702
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,587
Ah, you got that naughty
look on your face.

703
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,755
Get down then.

704
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,724

709
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,505
You're so beautiful.

710
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,710
No.

711
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,544
All done.

712
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,717
She had a tattoo on her ass.

713
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,653
- Do any of you have a tattoo on your ass?

714
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,321
- It was me.

715
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,322
- Really?

716
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,224
- It was me, yeah.

717
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,493
- Well let me go and have a look.

718

719
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,500
I wish it was.

720
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,006
Why don't you call me
at the Courtyard Hotel?

721
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,144
She sent me this.

722
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,713
- My girls don't get pregnant.

723
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,849
You must have come to the wrong place.

724
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,052
Chickory, get Freddy up here

725
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,321

726
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,657

727
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,525

Children's Home over there?

733
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,049

00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,386
- I know those kids.

737
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,587
They come here for candy.

738
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,421
- They do?

739
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,257
Do you know my son Severin?

740
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,326
- Ah, little small boy.

741
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,161
Yeah, he has your eyes.

742
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,029
- He does?

743
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,934
Say listen, if I gave you my number,

744
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,604
would you call me if he comes in?

745
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,439
- Certainly, I don't see why not.

746
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,042
- Thanks.

747
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,611
(gentle music)

748
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,947
That's really nice of you.

749
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,349
- May I ask why he doesn't live with you?

750
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,951
- Ugh.

751
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,886
'Cause I was kinda young and stupid.

752
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,955
I couldn't really even
take care of myself.

753
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,823
- And you want him back now?

754
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,058
- Oh yeah.

755
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,393
I miss him.

756
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,560
God I've done everything.

757
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,728
I went to court.

758
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,798
Done everything except kidnap him.

759
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,102
- Wait a minute, please.

760
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,705
(gentle music)

761
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,963
Little boys, they like these.

762
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,432
- Thank you, sir.

763
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,101
(ominous music)

764
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,017
- Get in here now.

765
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:53,851
Move it.

766
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:54,752
Move it.

767
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:55,953
Get inside now.

768
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,787
Move it.

769
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,621
Move it.

770
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,456
Move it.

771
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,290
Get in.

772
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,124
Now.

773
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,958
Move it.

774
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,792
Move it.

775
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,429
(gentle music)

776
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,371
Stop.

777
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,940
Get off my property.

778
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,041
I have a restraining order against you

779
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,542
and I'll call the police.

780
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,110
- Restraining order?

781
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,746
You can't keep me from my son.

782
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,915
- And what do you think
your son is gonna think

783
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,718
when he finds out the
kind of woman you are?

784
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,153
- I wanna see my son.
- No.

785
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,621
You're always interfering
with this orphanage.

786
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,923
Nothing but a filthy whore.
- Mom.

787
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,258
- [Orphanage Woman] Victor.

788
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,726
Victor.

789
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,394
- Severin, listen to me.

790
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,263
Mama is going to get you out of here okay?

791
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,598
Don't you worry.

792
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:42,933
- [Victor] Come on, kid.

793
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,068
- [Severin] Hey.

794
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,404
Let go of me you little son of a bitch.

795
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,039
Mom.

796
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:49,874
Mom, help.

797
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,111
- Listen to me, if anything
ever happens to my son,

798
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,079
I'm gonna kick your ass.

799
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,580
- Oh yeah?

800
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,983
Why don't you just stand
here until the police come?

801
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,552
(gentle music)

802
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,362
- Give this to Severin, okay?

803
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,931
(gentle music)

804
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,987
- Ugly little pink things.

805
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,690
Do you think that sex could
lead to something so disastrous?

806
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,764
My oh my.

807
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,598
Children.

808
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,935
Real children.

809
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,202
Give me the candy, Bernie.

810
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,773
(soft music)

811
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,746
- May I help you?

812
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,717
- You certainly may.

813
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,853
I've come to meet the children.

814
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,156
I'd like to meet all of them.

815
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:12,990
Every.

816
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,491
Single.

817
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,793
Last.

818
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:16,927
One of them.

819
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,330
(soft music)

820
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,604
- Restraining order?

821
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,906
That must be terrible for you.

822
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,308
Let's see, the book
must be here somewhere.

823
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,478
It's been a busy week with
witches all looking for spells.

824
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,147
Here it is.

825
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,150
This these are the most
powerful white magic spells

826
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,820
to be used only by the purest of heart.

827
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,959
- A lot of good that's gonna do me.

828
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,395
- Don't dismiss the goodness
within you, Lucinda.

829
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,864
- I'm just a whore.

830
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,102
I'm just a whore.

831
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,440
And I gave away my son.

832
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,148
I'll never get him back.

833
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,685
- You did what you thought
was right at the time.

834
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,154
It doesn't make you a
bad person, trust me.

835
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,656
Now just remember to make sure you get

836
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,325
all of the ingredients
before you choose a spell.

837
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,660
It's an old book, you know.

838
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,362
(ominous music)

839
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,498
- You're always good to me, Ursula.

840
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,295
- Shades of the dead druids,

841
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:09,466
counselors of the ancient tribes,

842
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,170
guardians of earth magic,

843
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:19,877
I Jason Mageborn,

844
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,615
present descendant of
Merlin command a vision.

845
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:32,022
My true, all chemical blood
be the offering to the dead.

846
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,893
(ominous music)

847
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:54,444
(speaking in foreign language)

848
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,816
Merlin, that's what transformation is,

849
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,552
guide to my progeny,

850
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,089
I command a vision.

851
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,527
Merlin, where the fuck are you, eh?

852
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:12,930
Come on.

853
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,333
- [Merlin] I hope this isn't
about your horoscope again.

854
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,968
- Oh, cut it out, Merlin.

855
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,803
That was 10 years ago.

856
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,005
- [Merlin] Seems like yesterday to me.

857
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:25,075
- Aye, well I've matured a
wee bit since then, you know.

858
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,211
- [Merlin] That's what you always say.

859
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,312
It's your blood.

860
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,314
Speak quickly before you faint.

861
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,818
- I need to know, do I have a son?

862
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,254
- [Merlin] Indeed you
do and not by a priest

863
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,590
who was chosen on the eve of Beltane.

864
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,959
- But does he have our blood, Merlin?

865
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,760
- [Merlin] I myself was born of a union

866
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,562
between a Goddess and a demon.

867
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,465
Now, in your son's case, who is the God

868
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,400
and who is the demon?

869
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,469
- That's not a fucking answer.

870
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,904
It's a riddle.

871
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,240
If you want me to play your archaic games,

872
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,809
then at least you can
play it straight with me

873
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,177
and give me a vision.

874
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,846
- [Merlin] You can see the
queen's ass if you so desire,

875
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,816
but you're an idiot if you
want to step inside the future.

876
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,418
The future is a realm of possibilities.

877
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:12,022
Weakened power as you are, all
you'll find are your fears.

878
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,991
- I'm not your fucker Arthur.

879
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,492
I'm not your boy king.

880
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,194
I'm your flesh and blood.

881
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,428
I need a vision.

882
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,797
- [Merlin] No, you're the playboy king.

883
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:23,400
The freaking Casanova of this family.

884
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,935
It's all yours.

885
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,504
(gentle music)

886
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:45,989
(speaking in foreign language)
(gentle music)

887
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,525
- You see?

888
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,263
Okay.

889
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,666
Let me set you in there.

890
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,500
Okay.

891
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,237
Now this is your first test of power.

892
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,071
Don't be scared.

893
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:01,905
Just remember the words.

894
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,073
I'm gonna be right here.

895
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,082
Just say the magic words.

896
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:18,655
(speaking in foreign language)
(gentle music)

897
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,458
All right, now try again harder.

898
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:26,463
(speaking in foreign language)
(gentle music)

899
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,800
Come on, boy, try.

900
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,034
Try boy.

901
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:36,740
(speaking in foreign language)
(gentle music)

902
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,442
You're my son.

903
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,843
You can do it.

904
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,078
- [Severin] I can't.

905
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,112
- [Jason] No, you can.

906
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,113
Try again.

907
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,114
- I can't.

908
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,717
(gentle music)

909
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,553
(coughing)

910
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,591
- Aw, fucking hell.

911
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,364
- Okay on summoning the true sprite.

912
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,365
Summoning the true sprite.

913
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,866
All who witness the
dance of the true sprite

914
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,801
will see beyond the mask of their own pain

915
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,070
to the truth of the real feelings.

916
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,772
Okay basic ingredients.

917
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,341
Fox, gloves, spear, wart, lynn seed oil,

918
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,411
deadly knight shade and natural yogurt.

919
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,545
Special ingredients.

920
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,646
Let's write this down.

921
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,017
Big John the Conqueror.

922
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,552
Meteorite.

923
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,055
Segments with the right
side of the human brain.

924
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,857
Oh that's nice, huh?

925
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,459
Mermaid's purse.

926
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,295
And Dodo feather.

927
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,666
Sounds pretty simple doesn't it, Gideon?

928
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,370
And I bet none of those
other nasty witches

929
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,339
will have a spell like mine.

930
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,976
(hand knocking)

931
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:46,810
Aw.

932
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,013
I don't wanna work tonight, Gideon.

933
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,521
Oh dear.

934
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,755
- Bless you my child.

935
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,358
- Father John Thomas.

936
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,593
Sister Blossom is not
feeling quite well tonight.

937
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,063
Perhaps another night would be better.

938
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,798
- Oh that's all right.

939
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,800
Would you give her these for me please?

940
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,634
- Ooh.

941
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,502
- Do wish her well for me.

942
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,106
- Father, would you wait a moment?

- I've come to collect my prize.

955
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,339
- Well you're jumping the gun, Beatrice.

956
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,173
Get off.

00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,910

It's not the eve of
Beltane yet, all right?

959
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:32,716
Leave me alone.

960
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,584
- That's never bothered you before.

961
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,753
- Aye, well things are different now.

962
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,022
I know myself better.

963
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,726
- I think you're wrong, Jason.

964
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,427
People like us, we never change.

965
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,764
- Aye, well times have changed.

966
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,066
There's much more at stake now.

967
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:50,901
Come on.

968
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,704
- Doesn't love count for anything?

969
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,274
(gentle music)

970
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,010
- Love?

971
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,879
It was never love Beatrice.

972
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,482
- Are you saying you don't care about me?

973
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,921
- Well even if I did care for you,

974
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:15,091
you certainly never gave
a shite about me, eh?

975
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:21,131
- Maybe so, but I am the one
that you've come here to get.

976
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,435
- Really?

977
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,239
You're certainly very
confident, aren't you?

978
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,075
- [Beatrice] Certainly.

979
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:32,909
- Eh?

980
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,012
Eh.

981
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,952
Eh.

982
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,554
(gentle music)

983
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,858
If you were so certain,

984
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:51,928
you'd wait to show off

985
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,133
your power at the coven, eh?

986
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,703
(gentle music)

987
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,506
No.

988
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:05,609
Come on.

989
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,111
That's it, Beatrice.

990
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,512
That's enough.

991
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,347
Get lost.

992
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,354
- Shut the fuck up.

993
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,188
Drive.

994
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,956
- What the fuck?

995
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:20,790
- Okay.

996
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,960
- Don't touch me.

997
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:28,898
Maddison.

998
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,302
I almost didn't recognize
you with your haircut.

999
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,175
God, what do you want?

1000
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,312
- You and me, baby.

1001
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,816
We're in the same business.

1002
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,352
- I highly doubt it.

1003
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:54,924
- I think we should have a partnership.

1004
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,426
What do you think?

1005
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,297
- And why should I?

1006
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,135
- Because I possess a spell

1007
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,005
that will certainly make
you win this little contest.

but I need to know why
you and your husband

1035
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,322
have not had children of your own?

1036
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,524
- There's nothing personal about it.

1037
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,093
We've been trying for years.

1038
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,329
That's when I had Richard tested.

1039
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,965
We found out he has zero sperm count.

1040
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,435
There is no need to be
embarrassed, darling.

1041
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,838
I'm sure this nice lady
encounters problems

1042
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,239
like yours every day.

1043
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,408
- Yeah.

1044
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,276
Well you do know it will take a few months

1045
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:24,414
to complete the paperwork
and I can't guarantee

1046
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,650
that you'll be able to
adopt this exact boy.

1047
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,352
- Exact boy?

1048
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,588
- But you can leave a deposit.

1049
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:32,422
- A deposit?

1050
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,358
- To speed the paperwork
along and then I see no reason

1051
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,394
why you couldn't pick him up immediately.

1052
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,229
- Of course.

1053
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,999
Give her your money, darling.

1054
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,636
5000 shall we say?

1055
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:51,541
- And another five in cash
when you pick the child up.

1056
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,110
(gentle music)

1057
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,045
- $400 for a rock?

1058
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,713
I can't afford this spell.

1059
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,583
- [Gideon] Sex is magic.

1060
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,784
- Sex is magic.

1061
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,852

Hey fine fucking cane
you got there, sugar.

1084
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,334
Come on in.

1085
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,907
- Don't be shy, Lucinda Bale.

1086
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,775
Let me have a feel of you to be sure

1087
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,778
that you are the same lass
of these past two years.

1088
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,183
Oh.

1089
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,752
Oh.

1090
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:16,819
Oh.

1091
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:21,257
Not another pair like them
to be found in the world.

1092
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,592
Oh.

1093
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:23,426
Oh.

1094
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:28,498
Now let me show you what I have brung you.

1095
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,433
Big John the Conqueror.

1096
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,201
It's a freak of nature.

1097
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,505
Just like your gorgeous bosom.

1098
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,440
- Just like your dirty nuts.

1099
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,911
- Not two to be found
anywhere in the whole world.

1100
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,646

Huh?

1104
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,651

(baby crying)

- We were like sisters.

1182
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,330
We grew up in the brothel together.

1183
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,631
When we were little, we used to have fun

1184
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,033
dreaming up far out names.

1185
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,801
Her favorite name was Necessity.

1186
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:02,605
Mine was Luxury 'cause
I could use a little.

1187
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,508
- So what happened to her then, eh?

1188
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,943
- Got knocked up like me.

1189
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:07,877
Ran away.

1190
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:11,247
So anything you think she
could do that I couldn't?

1191
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:14,417
- Well I do need to know where she is.

1192
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:16,485
- I don't know.

1193
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,422
(baby crying)

1194
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,424
- Well do you know what her real name is?

1195
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,526
- She was born and raised in a den.

1196
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,294
I don't think she had no real name.

1197
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,731
Can you pass me the Desitin over there?

1198
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,900
(baby crying)

1199
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,568
- Is there anything I can do to help?

1200
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:37,807
So what about the woman
that runs the den with her?

1201
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,275
What's her name?

1202
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,611
- Georgina Bale, why?

1203
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:42,445
- I don't know.

1204
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,013
Bale.

1205
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,015
Just a thought.

1206
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,517

(bright music)

1209
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,564
- Of course they don't pay me as much

1210
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,766
as they pay the men at the institute,

1211
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,535
but they're not gonna get away
with that for much longer.

1212

1213
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,355

1214
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,357
Listen, Melanie.

1215
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,461
I appreciate you bringing
me that mermaid purse.

1216
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,797
I know it was expensive.

1217
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,532
- It was no problem.

1218
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,001
We get them free at
the Marine Biology lab.

1219
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,436
I didn't have to pay for it.

1220

(bright music)

1221
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,446
- Now I know you been working hard,

1222
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,615
not getting out, getting much play, huh?

1223
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:56,419
- Especially surrounded by
all those chauvinistic pigs.

1224
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,988
(bright music)

1225
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:03,859

1226
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,462
What do to me?

1227
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,897
I'll do to you.

1228
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,265
Oh yeah.

1229
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:12,101
Oh yeah (laughs).

1230
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:17,740
Oh, oh.

1231
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:19,875
Oh yeah.

1232
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,445
(gentle music)

1233
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,060
- When my mother comes looking for me,

1234
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,696
you tell her where I am.

1235
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,431
- Oh, get that idea out of your head.

1236
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,133

1241
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:26,642
- [Lucinda] Any ailment, any time.

1242

For the right price, I'll make you mine.

1243
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,079
Leave a message.

1244
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,316
- Lucinda, we met at the
gas station in Greenview.

1245
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,885
I saw your son today.

1246
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,054
They was taking him from the orphanage.

1247
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,122
I just thought you need to know.

1248
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,591
If I could be of any help, let me know.

1249
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,426
Goodbye.

1250
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,096
- Under no circumstances at all

1251
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,131
can I tell you who adopted that boy.

1252
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:52,068
And I don't care if you
think you are the father,

1253
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,404
especially considering the
occupation of the mother.

1254
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,507
- And can you not call
these adopted parents for me

1255
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,476
and explain the situation?

1256
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,445
- Absolutely not.

1257
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,279
That's illegal.

1258
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,214
They have total autonomy and anyway,

1259
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,949
I don't know how to contact them.

1260
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,818
- And what about the boy's real mother?

1261
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:09,819
Lucinda Bale.

1262
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,154
Do you know where I can find her, perhaps?

1263
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,458
- Probably in the same place
you met her the first time.

1264
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,992

♪ Dodo, dodo, dodo ♪

1282
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,214
♪ Dodo, dodo, dodo ♪

1283
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,650
I'm here to pick up my dodo feather.

1284
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:16,986
- Dodos?

1285
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,487
- Dodo feather.

1286
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,555
- Are you sure?

1287
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,056
- Yeah.

1288
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:26,061
Listen, we'll just pluck it
off and he won't feel anything.

1289
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:30,266
- I can get you a peacock feather.

1290
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,368
I don't have any dodos.

1291
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,202
- What?

1292
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,071
What?

1293
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:38,240
What are you talking about?

1294
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,477
You have tigers and lions and gorillas

1295
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,880
and giraffes and elephants
and you don't have a dodo?

1296
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,149
What kind of shit is this?

1297
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,319
What kind of crap are you running here?

1298
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,221
- They've been extinct for 100--

1299
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,822
- Extinct?

1300
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,224
Oh my God.

1301
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:56,058
What?

1302
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,498
(elephant trumpeting)

1303
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,466
- [Ursula] I told you to
check all of the ingredients

1304
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,435
before you did the spell.

1305
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:07,403
- I did.

1306
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,738
I didn't know that dodos were extinct.

1307
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:10,773
Do I know about dodos?

1308
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,008
Do I know anything about dodos?

1309
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,110
- Well for heaven's sake,
you can choose another spell.

1310
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,645
- I can't.

1311
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,180
Tomorrow's the contest.

1312
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,015
Don't you know I did everything I could

1313
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,818
to pull this off and I
don't have it at all.

1314
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,019
- Lucinda.

1315
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:24,853
Lucinda.

1316
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,256
If it's the First Horn
you're interested in,

1317
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,657
then why don't you go directly to him?

1318
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,227
- Oh, oh and just walk up right up to him

1319
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,996
and go excuse me sir, I'm
that prostitute that you saw

1320
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:35,731
and you know we were like hmm

1321
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,000
and then we were like hmm
and now we have a son.

1322
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,268
Hey how do you like that?

1323
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:42,905
- Lucinda, I didn't realize

1324
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,941
that he's the father of your child.

1325
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:49,612
Well then you can go to
him directly and ask him.

1326
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:52,314
- Ursula, you don't get it, do you?

1327
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,950
This is my last chance to get my son.

1328
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,085
What if he takes custody of my son?

1329
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,686
What if he takes him?

1330
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,089
What if he tries to take him away from me?

1331
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,224
- Lucinda.
- No, no, no.

1332
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,493
- Lucinda, Lucinda.

1333
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,464
- If I win this contest,

1334
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,400
he'll respect me and I can have my son.

1335
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,802
We'll go and we'll adopt my son, Severin.

1336
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,739
And am I gonna win this contest?

1337
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,773
Am I gonna win this contest?

1338
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,341
Is he gonna respect me?
- Yes, he respects you.

1339
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,409
- Do you respect me?

1340
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,244
- I respect you, Lucinda.

1341
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,579
I respect you.

1342
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:27,316
- Now listen to me you little
brat, if you start screaming,

1343
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,586
I won't feed you and you'll
stay here until you rot.

1344
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:31,820
Do you understand?

1345
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:33,622
Do you?

1346
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:38,427
Now, if you're a good boy,
I'll bring your father here

1347
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,095
to collect you tomorrow night.

1348
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,164
- What about my mom?

1349
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,232
- [Beatrice] You can forget about her.

1350
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,800
She's dead.

1351
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,469
(ominous music)

1352
01:11:49,972 --> 01:12:01,350
(speaking in foreign language)
(ominous music)

1353
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,326
(upbeat music)

1354
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,147
- [Gideon] Check messages.

1355
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,151
Check messages.

1356
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,320
- Shut up you little twitch.

1357
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:44,360
(upbeat music)
(patrons chattering)

1358
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,975
(soft music)

1359
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,016
- Fucking little shit.

1360
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:09,351
That hurts.

1361
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,754
(soft music)

1362
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:16,992
Give me that shit.

1363
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:17,993
Give me that shit.

1364
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:18,827
Shit.

1365
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,829
Lucky I don't torch your little ass.

1366
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:28,370
(soft music)

1367
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:36,178
(speaking in foreign language)
(soft music)

1368
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,015
- Give me some.

1369
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,316
Oh yes.

1370
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,518
No kiss me.

1371
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:43,352
Kiss me.

1372
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,319
Go on, steal a kiss.

1373
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,154
Oh no.

1374
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:48,957
- Ew.

1375
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:50,926
Ew.

1376
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,498
Oh Ursula, I'm wasting my time.

1377
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,100
He's not gonna help me.

1378
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,068
- You're going to have to talk to him.

1379
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,737
That's that.

1380
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:02,938
- Ew.

1381
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,340
- Why do we have to wait until tomorrow?

1382
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,175
We're all here.

1383
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,544
You can spend 15 minutes with each of us

1384
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,012
and then make your decision.

1385
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,380
- Quite right.

1386
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,516
Beatrice may well be the best
looking witch in the land,

1387
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:17,386
but I doubt she's the best fuck.

1388
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,956
- You're all forgetting something.

1389
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,791
It's not a gang-bang that
we're having tomorrow.

1390
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,661
It is a contest to find
the most powerful witch

1391
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,931
to participate in the Coupling
for the Beltane ceremony.

1392
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,467
- Nobody's quite forgotten that, Natalie.

1393
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,902
And that is why everyone
is scared shitless.

1394
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,671
- Did you really think
you're gonna be the one

1395
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,706
to cast the most powerful spell, Beatrice?

1396
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,107
I mean, how much time do you

1397
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,243
actually spend practicing magic?

1398
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:45,614
The only practice you get
is pouting in the mirror.

1399
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:47,549
- Is that so, Gloria?

1400
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:51,153
Then why is it that not one of
you will look me in the eye?

1401
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,189
- Because you're phallus
Medusa and everybody knows it.

1402
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,625
(Group laughing)

1403
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,994
Come on, tell the first time
how many spells it takes

1404
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,029
to keep that face-lift of yours in place.

1405
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,666
- Jason knows firsthand that
I haven't had any face-lifts

1406
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,602
or any other type of lips for that matter.

1407
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,470
Isn't that right, Jason?

1408
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,973
- You're all a disgrace to your sex.

1409
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,376
How can you sit there and let
them pander to you like this?

1410
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,578
Do none of you have any self respect?

1411
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,781
We're just as important
in all of this as he is.

1412
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,251
- No, you're quite right, Natalie.

1413
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:23,085
I agree.

1414
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:23,919
Right.

1415
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:27,789
The First Horn won't
stand for anymore of it.

1416
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:31,426
So you'll just have to contain
yourselves until tomorrow.

1417
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,863
And on that note, goodnight.

1418
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:36,665
- Meow.

1419
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,236
- And don't wait up for me.

1420
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:47,809
- Ah.

1421
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:48,911
- What is it?

1422
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:51,113
- He's wearing the dodo feather.

1423
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,221
(bright music)

1424
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:11,867
I'll have the usual, Neal.

1425
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,102
- I'll have a lemon drop.

1426
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,604
You've got to have some confidence.

1427
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,506
You need to go and speak with him, dear.

1428
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,208
You need to go and speak with him, please.

1429
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,110
- What am I gonna say?

1430
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:26,148
- Darling, darkness and light
and the moon shining bright.

1431
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,182
I miss a man.

1432
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:28,450
May I join you?

1433
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,087
Go on.

1434
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,922
Go and talk to him.

1435
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,491
(bright music)

1436
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,331
- Do you mind if I sit here?

1437
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,999
- Suit yourself.

1438
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:46,568
(bright music)

1439
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,306
- It's an early bird day.

1440
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:54,209
It's one hour, special deal.

1441
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,778
(bright music)

1442
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,349
Do you want to fuck me?

1443
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,052
- Get lost why don't you.

1444
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,622
(bright music)

1445
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,257
- Do you have a match?

1446
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,527
- There's a bartender over there.

1447
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,296
Why don't you go and ask him?

1448
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,134
- Do you have a match?

1449
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,206
So, are you waiting for someone here?

1450
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:29,444
- Excuse me, another beer and a shot.

1451
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,278
- [Waitress] Do you want something?

1452
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,614
- I'll have what he's having.

1453
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:35,684
So am I bothering you?

1454
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,420
- I'm just sitting here
trying to have a quiet drink.

1455
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,989
(bright music)

1456
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:44,026
- Oh wow, look at her.

1457
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,529
Does she turn you on?

1458
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,299
- No, does she turn you on?

1459
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,836
- No, not that one.

1460
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,104
She.

1461
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,272
I don't want cellulite.

1462
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:01,243
I want a girl that's, you
know, she's beautiful.

1463
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:06,081
She has to be more
beautiful that me, right?

1464
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,085
- Right.

1465
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,553
- And look her tits are fake.

1466
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,156
- And how can you tell?

1467
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,859
- 'Cause it's like real breasts are like.

1468
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,829
You know they're up and they're squishy.

1469
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,931
And the nipples are always
hard when they're fake.

1470
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,233
That's how I know.

1471
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,302
- I'll remember that next time.

1472
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,138
(bright music)

1473
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,376
- Ew, I hate that.

1474
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:37,379
Pig.

1475
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,814
Hate when guys do that.

1476
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,282
No respect for women at all.

1477
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,852
They don't know how to
make a girl feel good.

1478
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:46,955
- What kind of a man
makes a girl feel good?

1479
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:47,989
- The gentle ones.

1480
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,926
They have compassion.

1481
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,762
They have a backbone, not
floppy fish, you know?

1482
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,599
They have a secret.

1483
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:58,867
That's what it is.

1484
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:00,368
- Secret.

1485
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:02,838
- That's pretty.

1486
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:03,739
What is it?

1487
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,242
- It's a dodo feather.

1488
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,777
- Did you know they're extinct?

1489
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:10,979
- Ah, it's a family heirloom.

1490
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:13,615
- Do you have a family?

1491
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,483
Are you married?

1492
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,517
- No.

1493
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,451
- Children?

1494
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,853
- No.

1495
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:18,687
- Good.

1496
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:20,989
- And what's good about that?

1497
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,891
- Well, I mean no, I didn't mean that.

1498
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:23,725
I mean.

1499
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,027
Do you want a blowjob?

1500
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:27,629
I can just slip under the table.

1501
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,166
- Get lost, will you?

1502
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,000
- What's wrong?

1503
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,602
Don't you find me attractive?

1504
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,836
- Was that a trick question?

1505
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,972
- Usually guys are all over me.

1506
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,840
- Well I can understand that.

1507
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,844
I mean you do have a
certain blunt charm but.

1508
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:43,578
- But.

1509
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:45,280
But what, what is it?

1510
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:46,915
- Well.

1511
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,620
I mean you must've been very
beautiful before your accident.

1512
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:52,921
- What?

1513
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:54,422
My accident?

1514
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,358
- What was it, a car wreck?

1515
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,059
Did you go through the windshield?

1516
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,662
- What the hell?

1517
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:01,963
Are you crazy?

1518
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:03,665
What accident?

1519
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,635
- I'm sorry.

1520
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,771
I haven't stopped drinking
since I got to New Orleans.

1521
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,610
- What's wrong with you?

1522
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:18,246
You too proud, too clean
to be fucking a whore?

1523
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,916
- Actually I'm famed throughout the land

1524
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,584
for going down on whores.

1525
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,186
- Oh bullshit.

1526
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,654
I know what kind of guy you are.

1527
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,488
You're the kind of guy thinks

1528
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,856
we should be all locked up, huh?

1529
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,258
We got diseases and disorders.

1530
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:33,061
Definitely unfit to be
mothers so fuck you.

1531
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,863
- You know I think you're going through

1532
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,832
a bit of an identity crisis.

1533
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:40,135
You'd be doing better business over there.

1534
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,572
- Believe me, I'm
selective about who I fuck.

1535
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,241
- You know what?

1536
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,810
So am I.

1537
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,413
(bright music)

1538
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,765
- Mister listen, listen.

1539
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:11,800
I've got to tell you something.

1540
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,168
I've got to tell you something.

1541
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:14,569

1542
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:16,972
Come on, what is it?

1543
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:17,806
- I.

1544
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:18,640
- You in trouble?

1545
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,474
Do you need help?

1546
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:20,308
Do you need money?

1547
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,176
You want money?

1548
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:22,244
I'll give you money.

1549
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,144
Just leave me alone.

1550
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,613
- I don't want your money.

1551
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,081
- What do you want?

1552
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:27,649
- I want your dodo feather.

1553
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:28,884
- You want my feather?

1554
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:29,718
- Mm hm.

1555
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,286
Listen I'll make you a deal, okay?

1556
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:32,187
I'll do anything.

1557
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:34,389
I'll do anything you want.

1558
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,457
Just give me that dodo feather please.

1559
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:37,225
- Oh God, you're out of your mind.

1560
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,160
- Please, please, please, come on.

1561
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:39,995
- No.

1562
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:40,929
- Come on.

1563
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,064
- Oy, stop it.

1564
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,065
Stop it.

1565
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,668
Take the feather.

1566
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,572
And get out of here.

1567
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:56,878
Jesus.

1568

We met at the gas station in Greenview.

1594
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,353
I saw your son today.

1595
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:48,256
They was taking him from the orphanage.

1596
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:50,992
(dramatic music)
(glass shattering)

1597
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:51,826
- No.

1598
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,732
I gave away my son.

1599
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,970
I'll never get him back.

1600
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,742
Give me my son.

1601
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,811
- You can't come bursting into my office.

1602
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,379
You have no rights here.

1603
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,447
- Where is he?

1604
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:15,016
- You should be thinking
of his best interest.

1605
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,719
He was very lucky to be adopted.

1606
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,455
There are better children
that have been here for years.

1607
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:22,824
- I want to know where my son is.

1608
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,994
- I have a restraining order.

1609
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,495
I'm calling the police.

1610
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:28,329
- Police?

1611
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:31,833
Why don't you call the FBI or
the national guard, you fuck?

1612
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,735
Now you give me my son.

1613
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,504
- Don't you threaten me, you filthy woman.

1614
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,577
- Where's the file?

1615
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,012
- [Orphanage Woman] There is no file.

1616
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,081
The state doesn't release
any information to me.

1617
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:46,915
- You crook.

1618
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,216
You criminal.

1619
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:49,317
Give me their names.

1620
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:52,353
- You are not privileged
to have that information.

1621
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:53,588
- Who adopted him?

1622
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,123
Who adopted him?

1623
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:56,357
Do you want me to say it again?

1624
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,960

01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,750
(crowd cheering)

1638
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,731
- Tonight, as the eve of Beltane,

1639
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:50,004
long ago bonfires raged
across the pagan land.

1640
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:54,976
People abandoned their
burdens to celebrate new life.

1641
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:59,480
Children were conceived out of wedlock.

1642
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:05,353
And the Gods were invoked to
protect the seasons crops.

1643
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:11,526
To mark this day, I would be
honored to join the winner

1644
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:14,862
of the spell contest for the coupling.

1645
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,532
(soft music)

1646
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:19,634
Let the celebration begin.

1647
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:24,639
(crowd cheering)
(soft music)

1648
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:37,619
- My how attractive you are, Maddison.

1649
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,153
Too bad I'm not a lesbian.

1650
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:42,257
- When do I get the kid?

1651
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,993
- After I win the contest.

1652
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,394
- Why wait?

1653
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:50,565
- Because if the spell you gave
me doesn't work, he's mine.

1654
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:53,234
- Hail the First Horn.

1655
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,872
He of shadows, he of night,

1656
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:01,709
I drink your piss, your vile, your fright.

1657
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:05,113
From Adial Grave to Algol Star,

1658
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,182
come out, come out, wherever you are.

1659
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:13,755
- [Demon Spawn] What you
want you blue haired twat?

1660
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:17,358
- To demonstrate my
power over your domain.

1661
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:20,228
Tell those who gather here who you are.

1662
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:24,065
- [Demon Spawn] What right
do you have to command me

1663
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,601
to give you my secret name?

1664
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,603
- Don't question my power.

1665
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:30,138
Reveal yourself.

1666
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:35,109
- [Demon Spawn] Make me you
pathetic, wretched, fag hag.

1667
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:40,982
- Reveal your name demon
spawn, I command you.

1668
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,550
- [Ezekial] Time out.

1669
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:44,185
Stop it.

1670
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:45,687
You win.

1671
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:52,193
Ezekial, miserable 14th son,
14th son, 14th son of Satan.

1672
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:55,730
I bow at your command forever and forever.

1673
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:59,567
Now please, stop squeezing my balls.

1674
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:06,674
(crowd laughing)

1675
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,277
- Go home Demon Spawn.

1676
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,379
- [Ezekial] Fuck you too.

1677
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:20,221
- Does any among you feel
they can better Betsy's power?

1678
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,056
Eh?

1679
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:24,759
(soft music)

1680
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:56,491
(crowd cheering)
(soft music)

1681
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:04,232
Does any among you feel you
can better Natalie's power?

1682
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,500
- [Crowd] Beatrice.

1683
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,901
Beatrice.

1684
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,369
Beatrice.

1685
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:10,671
Beatrice.

1686
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:12,507
- Hail the First Horn.

1687
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:17,345
I'll show you what real power is.

1688
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:26,354
I consecrate this magic
circle with ancient elements

1689
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:29,957
of earth, water, fire and air.

1690
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:33,995
Let all evil spirits come forth.

1691
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,798
Let all good be gone.

1692
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:39,634
(crowd screaming)

1693
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:47,241
Witch power, witch power, burn with fire.

1694
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,945
Influence these demons to bring me desire.

1695
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:56,651
Crimson passion, crimson
passion burn with fire.

1696
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:03,357
Bewitch this sator for my hire.

1697
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,801
(soft music)

1698
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:27,548
- [Virility] Here's what you want.

1699
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,184
Good girl.

1700
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:40,361
- Watch as I devour Virility himself.

1701
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,563
(soft music)

1702
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,142
- Nice, kitty.

1703
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:59,113
Good girl.

1704
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:03,150
Oh yeah.

1705
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:16,731
(soft music)

1706
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:46,060
(crowd cheering)

1707
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:57,004
- I am the best.

1708
01:32:57,004 --> 01:32:58,272
Never doubt me.

1709
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:00,675
I am the best.

1710
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:03,210
- The best of the worst.

1711
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,445
I challenge her.

1712
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:08,082
- Who let this clap trap in here?

1713
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:08,916
Get her out.

1714
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,785
She's not a member of this coven.

1715
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:12,720
- Relax, Beatrice.

1716
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,455
Maybe it's time that I join.

1717
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:18,459
- She's not a witch, she's a whore.

1718
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:20,628
She'll ruin the good name of this coven.

1719
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:22,330
- I'm a sex witch.

1720
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,165
And you, you're a fraud.

1721
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:28,502
I know all about you and you
know nothing about what I do.

1722
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:31,138
- I know that you're a filthy whore.

1723
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:32,907
- What are you afraid of, Beatrice?

1724
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:37,478
That my magic is more powerful than yours?

1725
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:41,048
- You wish, whore.

1726
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:42,283
Whore.

1727
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:43,117
Whore.

1728
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,018
Whore.

1729
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,052
- [Crowd] Whore.

1730
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:45,886
Whore.

1731
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:47,355
Whore.

1732
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,289
Whore.

1733
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,290
Whore.

1734
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,291
Whore.

1735
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,592
Whore.

1736
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:53,394
- Silence.

1737
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:54,962
Silence.

1738
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,330
Silence.

1739
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:58,332
I want to see her magic.

1740
01:33:58,332 --> 01:33:59,433
- Why?

1741
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:01,702
- Oh shut up, Beatrice.

1742
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:03,371
Give the wee lassie a chance.

1743
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:08,142
- Whore.

1744
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:11,879
(soft music)

1745
01:34:19,887 --> 01:35:32,660
(singing in foreign language)

1746
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:42,269
- Without me, you'll
never scratch the surface

1747
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,105
of the power he holds.

1748
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:48,242
- Come on out, boy.

1749
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,644
Your father's here.

1750
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:55,649
Don't you want to meet your daddy?

1751
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,224
- He's not my daddy.

1752
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:05,059
- Come on, son.

1753
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:06,794
Everything's gon' be all right.

1754
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,629
- You're not my father.

1755
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:10,264
I know what he looks like.

1756
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:11,832
He came to me in a dream.

1757
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:13,801
- I'll be more than a father to you.

1758
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:16,771
I'll be your friend.

1759
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,305
- I don't think so.

1760
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:24,612
(speaking in foreign language)
(soft music)

1761
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,252
- Come on, grab the kid.

1762
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:59,380
(singing in foreign language)

1763
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,085
(upbeat music)

1764
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:31,879
- All who will have their
own truth revealed to them,

1765
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:33,681
look into the light.

1766
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:37,418
Lucinda, look into my light and see.

1767
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:41,889
Abandon your doubts and
feels for I am conjured

1768
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:44,892
from the purity of your heart.

1769
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:47,494
I am the light within you.

1770
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:50,831
You have lived the life
of the wholly hollered.

1771
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:56,303
You are descendant of Ishtar,
great lover of Babylon.

1772
01:37:56,303 --> 01:38:01,308
You are a Priestess, a
Sorceress, a Prophet and Healer.

1773
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:04,578
Sister of Aphrodite and Mary Magdalene.

1774
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:09,516
You have been set apart
to be the bride of man

1775
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:12,253
and to give birth to the son of Merlin.

1776
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:17,424
Scarlet woman, you are the sacred whore,

1777
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:20,761
glorious daughter of Venus.

1778
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:39,980
(crowd cheering)
(soft music)

1779
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:46,320
- Severin.

1780
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,154
Oh God.

1781
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:52,293
Magic beads for you.

1782
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:55,796
(soft music)

1783
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:09,176
Hey.

1784
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:10,077
- Stay back, bitch.

1785
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,148
Here's the deal.

1786
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:18,485
I take the boy and you can
have both those bitches.

1787
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:19,720
I'm sure you can figure out a way

1788
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:23,090
to have more kids, oh great horny one.

1789
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,392
- You beg my wrath, Maddison.

1790
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:26,293
- What?

1791
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:27,294
Your wrath (laughs)?

1792
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,099
I can kill them both

1793
01:39:32,099 --> 01:39:34,201
and you wouldn't lift a finger to stop me.

1794
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:36,403
- Do something.

1795
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:39,306
- Lady, he's a lover not a fighter.

1796
01:39:40,207 --> 01:39:41,642
- Use your magic.

1797
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:44,378
- He can't use his magic to kill.

1798
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,513
Isn't that right, Merlin?

1799
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:48,449
True Blood.

1800
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:50,017
- I've warned you.

1801
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:51,218
- Forget it.

1802
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:54,989
- You reckon just 'cause I
think killing people's a mistake

1803
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:58,459
that I wouldn't lift a
finger to save my own son?

1804
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:02,696
- Yeah, you're still a
free range chicken shit.

1805
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:04,665
- So you want my blood?

1806
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:07,201
You need to turn your
lead into gold, right?

1807
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:09,136
That's why you're here.

1808
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:11,505
But do you understand it also means

1809
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:13,941
I have the power to transmute?

1810
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:15,275
- So?

1811
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:18,512
- So, did you ever hear the
riddle of the shape shifter?

1812
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:19,980
- So what of it?

1813
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:23,650
- The theory has something
to do with the one love idea.

1814
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:26,387

1837
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:53,674
