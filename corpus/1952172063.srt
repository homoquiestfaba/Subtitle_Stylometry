1
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:26,332
There's juice in the blender.

2
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:28,744
Jared's gonna say he hates it,
but he has to drink it.

3
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,046
- Juice is not negotiable.
- I understand.

4
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,738
Oh, and I need you to stop
at the farmer's market

5
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:37,382
to pick up some vegetables.
There's a list on the counter.

6
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,298
The farmer's market.

7
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,457
Why can't we just shop at the
supermarket like everybody else?

8
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:45,054
Leland, please. Do you want your
children to be like everybody else

9
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:48,001
and have chemicals and
pesticides and God knows what,

10
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:50,705
or do you want them to be better
than everybody else?

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,188
Better.

12
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:56,979
Damn!

13
00:00:57,227 --> 00:01:00,560
- What is in there?
- Lighting equipment.

14
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,030
- Well, how much did that cost?
- Oh, don't worry, Leland.

15
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,174
I will pay you back.

16
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,281
That's not the point.
What I meant was that it's...

17
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,642
We-We can't afford lighting equipment!

18
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,359
Move.

19
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,644
If I had a digital camera I wouldn't need
so much lighting equipment.

20
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,202
We cannot afford a new camera!

21
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:19,549
Karen, I do not want to have another fight!

22
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:20,957
I would love to have another fight,

23
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,759
because I am sick and tired of this one.

24
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:33,600
Don't forget about the farmer's market,
and don't pretend...

25
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,242
to forget about the farmer's market.

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,868
I will call you later.

27
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,590
And I love you too.

28
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:04,144
Hi. I'm leaving right now.

29
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:06,798
Is Sandy there yet?

30
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:14,401
Tell Jerry I'm bringing my lighting kit.

31
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:16,649
We'll need about an hour to set up.

32
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,858
MONK Season 2 Epi. 14
Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife

33
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,065
Hey, Monk.!

34
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,290
Captain.

35
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,568
- Happy garbage day!
- Thank you.

36
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,348
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:49,785
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood.

38
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,193
I was going to the farmer's market
to buy alfalfa sprouts.

39
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:53,976
I figured I'd drop that off.

40
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,708
That's your check for the Rutherford case.

41
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,149
Late.

42
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,243
- Who's late?
- Garbage truck.

43
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:02,884
It's 8:22. They've never been this late.

44
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,486
No, it's 8:15.

45
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,984
Is that the watch that Trudy gave you?

46
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:14,541
So, you're never gonna know what time
it is for the rest of your life? - Maybe.

47
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:17,986
You know, Trudy's been gone
for seven years. I...

48
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:21,226
I think maybe it's time
you think about letting go.

49
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,943
- Letting go?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,796
You should think about your future.

51
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,959
What future?

52
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:27,816
- Your future.
- I don't have one.

53
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,092
Yes, you do.

54
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes, you do.
And I think that you should...

55
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,549
you should start thinking about
building a life.

56
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,117
You should, uh, get on with it.

57
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,324
Just let it go.

58
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,783
At least buy a new watch.

59
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:42,201
- Just think about it.
- I'm afraid to.

60
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,490
Here! Here they come.

61
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,789
Hold on. Where's...

62
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:56,422
- Where's Tully?
- On vacation.

63
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:59,807
He never said anything to me
about a vacation.

64
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,250
Why would he tell you?

65
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,556
We have a relationship.

66
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:06,667
He's been collecting
my garbage for years.

67
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,257
Mister, relax, okay?

68
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,575
We know what we're doing.

69
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,940
You know, we taught Tully
the garbage game, okay?

70
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:14,660
Okay. Yeah, but wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

71
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:16,697
You... You have to start from this end.

72
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,937
Tully always starts from this end.

73
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:21,873
Didn't Tully mention me?

74
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:24,288
Believe me, I would have remembered.

75
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,323
What's in here?

76
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:31,267
Water.

77
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,356
You're throwing away water?

78
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,231
Don't ask.

79
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,921
Okay, now... now this one.

80
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:39,240
Dude, what difference does it make, man?

81
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,112
I mean, it's all going to the same place.

82
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:42,753
Actually, no.

83
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:44,736
When you get to the dump, uh,

84
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:47,858
my bags go in Sector Nine.

85
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,739
Sector Nine?

86
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,900
Tully puts my garbage in Sector Nine,

87
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,052
so... so it's separate.

88
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,645
Right. Sector... Sector Nine.

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,517
- You got it, Sector Nine.
- Have a good day.

90
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:06,112
Hey, God bless you and your work.

91
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:18,255
Captain, I've been trying to call you.

92
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,979
What's going on?

93
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,003
This morning...

94
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,693
This morning... - For God's sake,
Randy, just say it!

95
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:28,951
It's Karen.

96
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,979
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.
My wife, Karen, was just brought in.

97
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:40,123
Captain, I'm Dr. Maulding.
I was on duty when she was admitted.

98
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:42,495
Um, would you like to come with me?
I have an office upstairs...

99
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,581
No, no. Now. Tell me now.

100
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,195
She has some internal hemorrhaging

101
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,898
and a non-displaced fracture of the skull.

102
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,474
Bottom line. What's the bottom line?

103
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,861
Her vital signs are strong.
They seem to be holding.

104
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:54,338
If the swelling goes down, we're going
to operate first thing in the morning.

105
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,573
Wh-Who's gonna do that?

106
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:59,041
- Dr. Schecter and Dr. Foster.
- They're good.

107
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:02,071
I'm an R. N. I interned
here seven years ago.

108
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:03,681
She's right.
They're the best we have.

109
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,917
Okay. Could I see her?

110
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:07,327
In a few minutes. Um, Captain.

111
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:09,084
We're good at our job.

112
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,453
Let us do it.

113
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:11,465
Okay. Okay.

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,271
- Right, right. I'll call you back.
- What do you got?

115
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,089
Okay, this is what we know...

116
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:17,738
Sniper on Highway 9.

117
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:21,355
So far it looks completely random
a thrill killing.

118
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,059
He took out the tow truck driver,

119
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,419
- and the truck spun into the...
- Into Karen!

120
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,633
Who was it?

121
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,889
We don't have him... yet.

122
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,472
- I want everybody.
- You've got them, sir.

123
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:33,840
Everybody is volunteering.
There's gonna be a task force.

124
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,156
I talked to the commissioner.

125
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:37,780
- He said whatever you need.
- All right, good.

126
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,655
Monk.

127
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,554
You... - I know.

128
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,067
If I lose her... - I know.

129
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,984
We... Karen... - I know.

130
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,797
- Since... Since we were kids.
- I know.

131
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:01,259
I know.

132
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,056
Is there anything I can do?

133
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:10,600
You know what you can do.

134
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:14,396
The victim's name was Fernandez.

135
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:18,132
Frank Fernandez, 34, unmarried.
He lives in Oakland.

136
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,230
Witnesses?

137
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,802
We're still knocking on doors. Not yet.

138
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,817
He shot from over there?

139
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,270
Yes.

140
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,578
Any idea where he parked?

141
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:30,039
We haven't found any tracks.
He could have parked anywhere.

142
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,475
There's a million little side roads
around here. We're still looking.

143
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,643
But why there in the open?

144
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,923
The surrounding area is heavily wooded.

145
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,207
There'd have been more cover.

146
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:40,866
I don't know.
It's a good question.

147
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,795
Ooh! Hey, you lost?

148
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,580
No. I'm just thinking.

149
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,196
I'm not talking to you.

150
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:50,532
Don't, Sharona! Don't...

151
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,024
Don't touch the dog, okay?

152
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,292
Just please don't pat the dog.

153
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:55,120
- Don't touch the dog.
- Well, why?

154
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,843
Okay, if you touch the dog, Sharona,
I'm...

155
00:08:57,878 --> 00:08:59,427
I have to let you go.

156
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:02,142
You always say you're gonna let me go,
but you never do it.

157
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:04,186
Don't listen to him.
He doesn't like anybody.

158
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,407
- Come on. Whose doggy are you?
- We recovered the shell.

159
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:09,436
It's a thirty-aught-six from
a Winchester bolt action.

160
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,424
It's not a sniper's rifle.
He's a hunter.

161
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,651
Look at this.

162
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,635
He crawled through this hole.

163
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,599
Shirt got caught.

164
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:20,714
He fired from over there
behind the mound.

165
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:26,339
How did he know the hole was here?

166
00:09:26,374 --> 00:09:28,288
Maybe he cased the area?

167
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:31,061
Or he lives nearby.

168
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,160
She's gonna want to keep it.
We can't have a dog!

169
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,305
You don't live together.

170
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,799
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

171
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:44,249
You want to see something really weird?

172
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,779
No.

173
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,707
Okay.

174
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:54,284
He wasn't wearing any shoes.

175
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,749
What?

176
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:58,813
- Watch your step.
- Bare feet?

177
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,833
Why would a sniper... go barefoot?

178
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:07,039
Especially at 6:00 in the morning.

179
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,473
It's been freezing.

180
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,104
Maybe he was an American Indian?

181
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:13,830
An American Indian sniper?

182
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:18,167
Maybe it was an uprising...
against technology.

183
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,394
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

184
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,592
Hardly any, really.

185
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:27,102
- Oh, "Native American."
- That doesn't help.

186
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,800
Lieutenant Disher...

187
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,683
Really? - Uh-huh.

188
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:35,349
You're gonna wanna to see this.

189
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:36,747
Yahhh!

190
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:38,738
This can't be a coincidence.

191
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:40,162
What are you talking about?

192
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,434
Frank Fernandez, the truck driver.

193
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:45,240
They've looked everywhere.
They can't find them.

194
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,528
Can't find what?

195
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,402
His shoes.
He was barefoot too.

196
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:01,978
Hey.

197
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:04,030
Hey yourself.

198
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,577
- I brought you some coffee.
- Thanks.

199
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,536
How's Mrs. S.?

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,383
She's still unconscious.

201
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,816
- Have you seen her yet?
- Yeah, I've seen her.

202
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,369
I'll feel a whole lot better when
she can see me.

203
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:18,499
How are the boys doing?

204
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,015
They're scared to death.

205
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,068
They're with my mother,
which is scary enough.

206
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:24,575
What do you got?

207
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,418
It's coming together.

208
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,700
What does that mean?

209
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,208
The killer and the victim were
both barefoot.

210
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean, Monk isn't sure what it means,
but he knows it's important.

211
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,730
What, do you have a suspect?
Do you have a name?

212
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:39,266
Not yet. The task force has a theory.
They're checking it out.

213
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,245
What?

214
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,257
I'm not supposed to tell you.

215
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,979
They warned me.

216
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:54,959
You know the local transport
union's on strike. - Yeah?

217
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:56,861
Harry Bolston, the union boss,

218
00:11:56,896 --> 00:12:00,251
he's made a few threats.
It's getting ugly.

219
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,748
Okay.

220
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:04,620
The tow truck belonged to a union shop.

221
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,733
The driver was a scab.

222
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:13,234
It was a union thing?

223
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,821
It's just a theory, sir.

224
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:29,296
- They're not sure yet.
- Son of a bitch.

225
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:33,522
- Where are you going?
- Never you mind, son.

226
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:37,950
Okay, I'll go with you.

227
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,131
No deal, no work!

228
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,996
No deal, no work!

229
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,475
- No deal, no work!
- Who's on the front gate?

230
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,415
Little Tommy and his crew.

231
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,903
Tell him to take pictures of all
the drivers, so we know who they are.

232
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,537
And don't hide the cameras.

233
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,082
I want them to know that we know.

234
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:57,336
Yes, sir, Mr. Bolston.

235
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:01,507
If you want, they can do more than
just take pictures.

236
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,931
No. - You're the boss.

237
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:08,872
No deal, no work!

238
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:10,585
No deal, no work!

239
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,770
No deal, no work!

240
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,205
Okay. Okay, bye.

241
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,743
That was Disher.
They're on their way.

242
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:21,978
Why are we even here?

243
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,452
- I want to protect the captain.
- From who?

244
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,509
From himself.

245
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,514
Adrian? No!

246
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,543
You call him "Adrian"?

247
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:31,797
It seemed to fit.

248
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:34,130
He's nervous,
and he's always cleaning himself.

249
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:37,354
- You should be flattered.
- I should be, but I'm not.

250
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:46,529
Scabs go home!

251
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:49,147
Scabs!

252
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,447
All right.

253
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:51,777
Scabs.!

254
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,569
Union! Union!

255
00:13:54,604 --> 00:13:56,707
Scabs go home!

256
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:58,576
Union!

257
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:01,799
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm a union girl.

258
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,616
- Since when?
- Since I started working for you.

259
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,567
Scabs go home!

260
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:09,681
I should start my own shop.

261
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,299
Do it. I'll join you.

262
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:12,956
You're not allowed.
You're management.

263
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,962
Oh, yeah? Good.
Get rid of the dog.

264
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:16,766
Will you stop worrying about this?

265
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:19,059
I got the vet's number off the collar.

266
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:22,079
They gave me the owner's name,
and I'm gonna drop him off later, okay?

267
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,034
Okay.

268
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:27,794
I'm gonna miss you.
Gonna miss you, honey.

269
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,159
No work, no deal!
No work, no deal!

270
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,584
- Where is Harry Bolston?
- Captain, please be careful.

271
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:35,414
Bolston's already sued
the department twice.

272
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,378
I'm just gonna talk to the man, Randy.
That's all.

273
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,442
Captain, I think you're making
a mistake. - Not now, Monk.

274
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,198
I-I don't think the union is involved.

275
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,015
Look, you've been
reading about this strike.

276
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,429
The negotiations are going their way.
Every editorial is behind them.

277
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,825
Why would they do something stupid now?

278
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,768
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It makes sense to me.

279
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,369
Also, the shooter wasn't wearing shoes.

280
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:55,705
Can you imagine any of these guys
running around barefoot?

281
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,188
- Well, maybe he wasn't thinking straight.
- Maybe you're not.

282
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:00,097
Look, Monk, you don't know
what I'm thinking.

283
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,104
I think I do.

284
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,870
The place you're in now,

285
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,473
that's where I live.

286
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,606
Look, I'm just gonna go talk
to the guy, all right?

287
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,371
- There's no...
- That's all. Stay here.

288
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,640
Hey, Bolston.

289
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:21,615
I'm Captain Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco Police Department.

290
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,416
This is a legal strike, Captain.
We've got every right to be here.

291
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:26,148
I don't care about your strike.

292
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,490
There was a shooting
on Highway 9 this morning.

293
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,183
- A driver was killed.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

294
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:32,901
I already talked to the cops.

295
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:35,513
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told them...

296
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,512
I had nothing to do with that.

297
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:40,831
It's what we call serendipity.

298
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,650
"Serendipity."

299
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:46,822
You've got five seconds to wipe
that smile off your face.

300
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,397
Did you say this?

301
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,493
"We're gonna bring this company down
using any means necessary"?

302
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:54,850
- Did you say that?
- No. I was misquoted.

303
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,643
- You know how that goes.
- This is incitement, you son of a bitch.

304
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,449
You might as well have pulled
the trigger yourself.

305
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:02,622
Now look, Captain. I can't control
every member of my union,

306
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:08,614
just like you can't control every stupid,
loudmouth cop in your department, can you?

307
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,700
You're Frank Wicks, aren't you?

308
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,949
I brought you in for assault
during the last strike, didn't I?

309
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:16,007
- You got a good memory.
- You're damn right I do.

310
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,844
- Do you own a hunting rifle, Wicks?
- I don't have a gun.

311
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,710
- I don't need one.
- Right.

312
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:24,474
- Where were you at 6:00 this morning?
- He was with me.

313
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,625
We were here, okay?
All morning, setting up.

314
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,535
Captain! The hospital just called.
Karen's awake.

315
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,125
This isn't over.

316
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,440
I got 10 lawyers.
Call one of'em!

317
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:47,188
We've stopped the hemorrhaging
and all the internal bleeding.

318
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,708
About an hour ago she
started fasciculating.

319
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,954
Oh, my Lord!

320
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,635
No, no, no. That's a good thing.
It means she's... she's stable.

321
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,293
She's not out of the woods yet.

322
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,653
We still don't know
how serious the head injury is.

323
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,871
The next six hours will tell the story.

324
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:01,143
Can we see her?

325
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:04,424
Maybe tomorrow after the surgery.

326
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,685
I think her husband
could use some help.

327
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:19,472
Hey.

328
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,014
I hate hospitals.

329
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,668
The doctor says she's stable.
Thank God.

330
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,856
She woke up for a couple minutes. I...

331
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:33,415
She could barely breathe.
That's how much pain she's in.

332
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,192
She asked how the kids were.
I said the kids were fine.

333
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:39,614
She passed out again.

334
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:41,514
If I lose her...

335
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:44,824
What if I lose her?

336
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,365
You're not. You're not.

337
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,685
You're not gonna lose her.

338
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:54,266
"Not gonna lose her."
I remember I said that to you one time.

339
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,288
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,415
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,138
Peanut bar.

342
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:17,930
I hate these.
Do you want it?

343
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,698
- Why'd you buy it?
- I didn't buy it.

344
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,074
I felt like hitting something.

345
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,785
Adrian, I'm gonna spank you.
Come on.

346
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,029
- Are you talking to me or the dog?
- Both.

347
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:38,660
Ooh! - Oh, I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll...
I'll stay here.

348
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:41,372
That's a good idea. Come on.

349
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,615
Come on. Come on.

350
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,000
Samson! There you are!

351
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,599
Oh! Where you been, huh?

352
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:52,133
Where's you been? Mmm.

353
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:53,331
Where's my squirrel?

354
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,293
Usually when he runs away he brings
me back a dead squirrel.

355
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,870
You must be disappointed.

356
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:01,140
Your taste is getting better.
She's a lot cuter than a dead squirrel.

357
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,886
Thanks.

358
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:04,950
I'm Evan Coker.

359
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,392
Uh, Sharona Fleming.

360
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,968
Sharona, I...
I don't know how to thank you.

361
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:11,146
I... I've been going out of my mind.

362
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,292
I don't know how he got away.

363
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,872
I must have left the gate open.

364
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,245
Well, he's really a great dog.

365
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,536
I had to leave him at my sister's,
'cause if I brought him home,

366
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,814
my son would have fallen in love with him.

367
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:23,106
He gets very attached to pets, you know?

368
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:27,188
I think it's because his father's
not around. I...

369
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,837
I'm divorced.

370
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:32,070
- Okay.
- All right.

371
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:36,157
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

372
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,028
I just got it.
It's kind of an impulse thing.

373
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:42,254
Well, impulses can be fun.

374
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,577
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

375
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:45,482
Hi.

376
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,554
I was, uh, just fixing your sundial.

377
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:50,386
- Yeah, leave it alone. It's fine.
- Ahhh.

378
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,952
It's five hours off.

379
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:54,496
No, it's not.
My son checked it last week.

380
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:57,371
Oh! Well, he did it wrong.

381
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,722
- Well, he's an astronomer.
- Oh.

382
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:03,128
Maybe his watch was broken?

383
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,634
Who are you?

384
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,156
Just a concerned citizen, ma'am.

385
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:08,493
Just a Good Samaritan just passing by.

386
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,467
- You're demented!
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.

387
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,067
Oh. There you go.

388
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,213
It's all done, and you'll thank me later.

389
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,257
Get out of my yard, you creep!

390
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:21,538
Do you know him?

391
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:23,513
Yeah, he's my boss.

392
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,479
I don't know how he got out.

393
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:27,673
I must have left the gate open.

394
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:31,226
- So what does he do?
- He's a detective.

395
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:34,366
We're working with the police now
on that sniper case.

396
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,919
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
They think it's a union thing, right?

397
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:37,934
No, no. My...

398
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,480
- My boss doesn't think so.
- Oh, he doesn't?

399
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:41,620
No.

400
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:44,624
And believe it or not, he's never wrong.

401
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:55,199
Hi, Karen.

402
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:56,858
Hi! - Hi.

403
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:58,844
- Hello.
- Are those lilacs?

404
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:00,988
I love lilacs. Thank you.

405
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:03,222
- Will you put 'em here?
- Sure.

406
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:06,030
- How do you feel?
- Like I was hit by a truck.

407
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,423
Ah, get it? - Oh. I do.

408
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,618
Shhh. He's been sleeping there all night.

409
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:29,741
What are you doing?

410
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,305
Just making them even.

411
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,264
- Even?
- You'll sleep better if they're even.

412
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,746
What are you talking about?

413
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:37,838
Hey! Did Max draw this?

414
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:39,834
Yeah. The boys were here all morning.

415
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,159
You know, they're
the best medicine in the world.

416
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:45,162
You know, if... if there's anything
we can do, we...

417
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:46,614
Well, as a matter of fact are
you busy tomorrow?

418
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:49,093
Because we need someone to
take the boys out to lunch.

419
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:52,607
Yeah. Sharona, I promised my mother
that I'd give her a break.

420
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:53,829
But I've got to work, so...

421
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:56,879
You know, I'd love to,
but Benjy has a dentist appointment.

422
00:21:56,914 --> 00:22:00,039
Hey! But Adrian can take 'em!

423
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:02,643
- Uhh...
- They would love that!

424
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:04,252
Would you mind, Adrian?

425
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,920
You mean, take the children
to a restaurant?

426
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:08,658
- Uh-huh.
- You mean, a public restaurant?

427
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:11,812
- Umm...
- They would love it.

428
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:15,423
Sure. Great idea.

429
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:18,220
Boy, I can't wait.

430
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,992
Monk, I'm wide awake.

431
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:26,481
Wide awake.

432
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:51,728
Get over here.!

433
00:22:51,763 --> 00:22:53,840
He's hurt bad.! Hurry up.!

434
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,446
Right. Okay, good work. Captain?

435
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,175
- What?
- You were right.

436
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,715
Second shooting at the truck depot?

437
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,114
Thirty-aught-six from
a Winchester... the same gun.

438
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:12,014
So they're both union related.

439
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:13,563
Don't try to tell me any different.

440
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:15,642
- What about the barefoot angle?
- What about it?

441
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,492
Well, Monk seems to think
the union isn't... - Look.!

442
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:21,673
It's not his wife being fed
through a tube, is it?

443
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,248
No, sir.

444
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,617
You know, I've been reading about this,
uh... this sniper.

445
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,394
That's, uh, really terrifying.

446
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,866
The police think it's union related.

447
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:34,140
And what-what, you don't agree?

448
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:39,984
I think the second shooting was
a diversion to throw us all off the trail.

449
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,593
Hmm. Well, it's still a tough case.
How do you feel?

450
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,194
I'm torn.

451
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:48,906
Half of me is worried about Karen,

452
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:54,046
and 40% is worried about
Captain Stottlemeyer,

453
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:58,901
and five percent...
is relieved...

454
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:04,281
that somebody finally understands
what I've been going through.

455
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:06,353
You know that's not 100%?

456
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:08,442
I know. I always keep...

457
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:13,183
part of me empty
for-for emergencies.

458
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:17,641
What... So-So, what, you-you offered
to take the two boys to lunch?

459
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:19,502
I didn't exactly offer.

460
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:22,568
I just felt it was, uh...

461
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:27,638
it was something that
I-I-I had to, uh... Sorry.

462
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:30,489
I can't concentrate.
What is that noise?

463
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:33,012
Oh. Oh, that's, uh,
the white noise machine.

464
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:35,334
We've always had it here.

465
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,944
No, this one's different.

466
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,785
Well, yeah. I mean,
the-the other one broke.

467
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,612
Uh, it's just a new... newer model.
But it's the same.

468
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,888
No, it's not.

469
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:51,463
No. The old one went,
"shuuu."

470
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:55,001
And this one goes, "shiii,"

471
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,697
not "shuuu," "shiii."

472
00:24:57,732 --> 00:25:00,696
It's like a half an octave higher. I'm...

473
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:03,028
I'm sure all your patients
are complaining.

474
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:05,705
No, No, actually, you're the only one.

475
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,939
Well, they're being polite.

476
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,277
Is that better?

477
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:17,986
No.

478
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:19,495
No.

479
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:24,747
All right, Adrian, would you like me
to try to get the old machine fixed?

480
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:26,660
- Oh, that would be great.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:28,350
Thank you.

482
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,074
I'll wait here.

483
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,156
I didn't mean now, Adrian.

484
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:38,401
I'll try to have it for next week.

485
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:42,835
- Captain.
- What's that?

486
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,958
That savings and loan robbery
in Delmare last Monday.

487
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:47,791
Clerk was shot and killed
during the get away.

488
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,536
- The clerk was 22 years old.
- I got it, Rick.

489
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,185
Captain?

490
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,390
Captain.

491
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:57,496
What? - We've got other cases, sir,
and they're starting to pile up.

492
00:25:57,531 --> 00:26:00,307
No! Randy, you have other cases.

493
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,958
In this room, there are no other cases.!

494
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:05,996
Understood?

495
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:10,318
What the hell is this?
What is he doing here?

496
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:12,507
Harry Bolston to see Agent Grooms.

497
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,949
Yeah. He'll be right with you.

498
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,379
Good. You got a room around here
where I can make a call in private?

499
00:26:16,414 --> 00:26:18,571
Right out here, first door to your right.

500
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:21,834
- Agent Grooms called him in.
- He... Without my okay?

501
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:23,263
According to Grooms,
he's been cooperating.

502
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:24,921
Yeah, I'll bet he's been cooperating.

503
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:26,103
Sir, don't.

504
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:29,259
Randy. This is my house.

505
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:32,576
Randy, the man is in my house.

506
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,002
- Where'd Bolston go?
- Conference room.

507
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:43,808
Just spend the money.

508
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:47,400
Yeah, that's what the strike fund is for.

509
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:48,624
Later.

510
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,258
Captain Stottlemeyer.

511
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,737
Captain Stottlemeyer is not here.

512
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,541
It's just us, Harry.
Just a couple of guys.

513
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,427
I heard about your wife.

514
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:09,577
I'm sorry, I really am.

515
00:27:09,612 --> 00:27:12,170
- What's her name?
- Her name is Karen.

516
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:13,414
Well, I'll look into it.

517
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:16,014
And if it was one of my crew,
I'll take care of it.

518
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:19,615
It was one of your crew, Harry.

519
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:22,668
Probably handpicked.

520
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,540
- Everything okay, boss?
- Yeah.

521
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:30,984
Why don't you call in some more goons,
make it a fair fight?

522
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,724
Now, listen, Captain. I can't do business
with you hounding me like this.

523
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,836
So what's it gonna take to
get you off of my back?

524
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,497
It's gonna take a heck of lot more
than your girlfriend here.

525
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:48,601
Stay down!

526
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,092
Stay down!

527
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:54,449
Oh, boy!

528
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:57,991
- What did you do?
- He didn't do anything.

529
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:01,341
My friend tripped...

530
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:04,872
on his own shoelaces.

531
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:13,488
It wasn't me.

532
00:28:18,895 --> 00:28:20,717
Ever been here before, Mr. Monk?

533
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:21,993
No.

534
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:24,271
No, I don't... go out much.

535
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:25,718
Oh, we come here all the time.

536
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:28,186
Well, I can see why.

537
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:30,842
It's so... loud...

538
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:34,690
and... loud.

539
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:38,008
- Is this really what the '50s were like?
- Exactly.

540
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:40,789
It's like a time machine.

541
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:46,734
Max, stay in the lines, okay?

542
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:50,060
Max, you have to stay inside the lines.

543
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,609
I don't want to.

544
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:55,527
Please. It's-It's a rule.

545
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:58,172
Rules are fun, huh?

546
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,698
Finish that later, okay?

547
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:06,653
Hey, cats and kittens, what's shaking?

548
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,481
I'm Cindy-Lou.
I'll be your waitress.

549
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:09,782
Who's ready to roll?

550
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,570
I'll have an Astro Burger and a Coke.

551
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:13,998
Me, too. - Yeah.

552
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,708
How about you, Pops?

553
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:17,775
Uhhh.

554
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,786
Uh, nothing.
I'm fine. I'm good.

555
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:24,418
I just ate, uh,

556
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:26,476
nine hours ago.

557
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:30,084
All right. I'll be back in two shakes.

558
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,246
Say something crazy.

559
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,602
Hey Max, he's not crazy, okay?

560
00:29:34,637 --> 00:29:37,460
He's... troubled.

561
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:39,742
Thank you, Jared.

562
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,940
I saw your mom today.

563
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:44,599
She-She's really doing great.

564
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:47,642
The doctors say she's gonna be
coming home soon.

565
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:50,824
I pray for her every night.

566
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:53,795
Yeah, me too.

567
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,244
Check please.

568
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,187
- Isn't this fun?
- Yes, it is.

569
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:33,917
But what are you gonna do?

570
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:53,890
What is it with you and this sundial?

571
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:58,498
I remembered something when
I was with Stottlemeyer's kids.

572
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:01,726
- How'd that go?
- Fine, fine. Kids love me.

573
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:03,009
Oh, my God, he's back!

574
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,465
I told you before!
This is private property!

575
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,393
We'll just be one second, ma'am.

576
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:08,607
Thank you very much.

577
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:10,151
Call the captain.
I solved the case.

578
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:11,823
Go!

579
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:14,633
- Who... What... She did it?
- No. I wish she did.

580
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:18,609
- You solved it with the sundial?
- The sundial is the key.

581
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,522
Okay, we've got our warrant.

582
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:25,139
We're going into the union
headquarters building here.

583
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,031
- I need a block at these two
intersections. - It's already done, sir.

584
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,863
All right, now, the main offices are
on floors two and three.

585
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:33,421
- Are they armed?
- We're not sure. Assume yes.

586
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:34,379
We're going in heavy.

587
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:36,900
Two entry teams... here and here.

588
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:38,131
Nobody's knocking.

589
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,387
We pick and ram.

590
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:41,848
- Who's takin' point on Team One?
- That would be me.

591
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:44,210
I go in first.
Harry Bolston is mine.

592
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,695
- Any questions?
- Okay, it's showtime!

593
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,394
- Disher.
- Suit up! Vests and helmets!

594
00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:52,959
Okay. Captain, that was Monk.

595
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:00,523
He said he solved the case.

596
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:06,011
- He what?
- He says it's not a union thing.

597
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:11,498
Is he sure?

598
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,697
He's Monk.

599
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:17,952
It's your call, Captain.

600
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,686
Stand down!

601
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,366
Hey, Monk!

602
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,397
What do you got?
You got a name? Okay.

603
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,411
- Take it easy.
- Don't worry.

604
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:40,952
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
I promised Karen.

605
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:41,930
What do you got?

606
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:43,690
Evan Coker.
This was his car.

607
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:46,795
This was the car that was being towed
when the driver was shot on Monday.

608
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,940
Yeah, remember that dog I found?
It belonged to Evan Coker.

609
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:52,523
Coker, yeah.
Yeah, it was being repossessed.

610
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:55,392
I mean, we checked him out.
He was clean.

611
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:58,131
I mean, I don't even think
he was worried about losing it.

612
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,154
- Didn't he just buy a new T-Bird?
- He didn't care about the car.

613
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,211
He cared about something in the car.

614
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:05,860
What, money?

615
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,492
A handgun in the glove compartment.

616
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,763
Look at the owner's manual.

617
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:12,000
That's gun oil, isn't it?

618
00:33:12,035 --> 00:33:13,442
It sure is.

619
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:15,252
He kept a handgun in here.

620
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:18,644
- A gun he had to get back.
- Why?

621
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,594
I... I don't know. Obviously, it...

622
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:24,766
it connected him to something.

623
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:27,148
Something worth killing for.

624
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:29,060
Here's what happened.

625
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,827
On Monday morning, the sound of the
tow truck must have woken him up.

626
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,700
His car was being repossessed.

627
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:41,098
He knew that if the car ever
got to the impound lot,

628
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,482
they'd find his gun.

629
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:44,552
Somehow he had to stop that truck.

630
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,611
He had less than a minute to
come up with a plan.

631
00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:49,612
He didn't have time to get dressed
or put his shoes on,

632
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:52,007
which explains the footprints.

633
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:55,394
The truck had to go all the way back
through town to reach the highway.

634
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,851
He knew that if he ran,
he could head it off.

635
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:59,702
That's how the dog got loose...

636
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,567
and how the sundial next door
got turned around.

637
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:08,029
He cut through the backyards,

638
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,796
across the edge of the park,

639
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:14,910
climbed through the chain-link fence,

640
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,315
and waited for the tow truck.

641
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,893
Then... - Yeah, I know
what happened after that.

642
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:41,950
Right after the crash,
he retrieved the gun.

643
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,378
There was a gravel road, and
he didn't want to walk home barefoot.

644
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:51,332
So before he left,
he stole the dead driver's shoes.

645
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:56,497
And somehow he managed to get out of
there without anyone noticing him.

646
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,738
Don't move her!
Don't move her! - Get some help!

647
00:34:58,773 --> 00:35:00,843
Well, what about the second
shooting at the truck depot?

648
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:02,349
Strictly for our benefit.

649
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:06,213
He wanted us to keep thinking
it was a union thing.

650
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,418
What do you think?

651
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:10,252
- It's good enough for me.
- Okay, Captain.

652
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,157
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

653
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,648
Captain, wait. We've got to...

654
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:14,536
We've got to call the task force.

655
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,269
We need a search warrant.

656
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,284
We got this guy.
We've got him.

657
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:21,221
Let's do it right.

658
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:35,562
Hey!

659
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:36,888
What are you doing here?

660
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:38,799
I was just in the neighborhood.

661
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,129
Hi.!

662
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:42,029
He missed you.

663
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:44,378
Actually, we both did.

664
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:46,450
What happened to your feet?

665
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:48,539
Oh, a windsurfing accident.

666
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,901
Mm. - You wanna come in?

667
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,843
Well, actually I'm not alone.

668
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:54,500
I have a few friends with me.

669
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:56,793
Great. The more the merrier.

670
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:03,748
- What's going on?
- It's a warrant.

671
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:06,559
My friends wanna look around.

672
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,026
Look for what?

673
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:10,831
A rifle, a handgun,
maybe a pair of shoes...

674
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:13,488
taken off a dead truck driver.

675
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:17,310
Do you know who I am?

676
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:23,170
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.

677
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,362
I read about you, uh...

678
00:36:26,002 --> 00:36:28,410
How's your wife?

679
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:33,039
My wife is gonna be fine.

680
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,653
The doctors saved her life.

681
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:40,205
You should call them and thank them,
because they saved yours too.

682
00:36:56,287 --> 00:37:01,186
You might wanna let the lieutenant
hold that for you.

683
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:04,152
Why? Are you afraid I'll use it?

684
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:08,471
I would.

685
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:13,637
I understand now, Monk.

686
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:17,046
You can't let it go, can you?

687
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:19,967
No.

688
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:26,424
Don't ever lose that watch.

689
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:27,927
I won't.

690
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:30,499
- Anything?
- Not yet.

691
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,028
Is that it?

692
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:35,298
Can I start cleaning
my place up now, please?

693
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,189
No.

694
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,775
Step inside. I'd like to ask you
some more questions.

695
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,356
Thank you.

696
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,293
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

697
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:53,316
It's garbage day!

698
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,748
Hey! Stop!
Stop the truck!

699
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:57,028
What are you doing?

700
00:37:57,063 --> 00:37:58,659
Hold it.!
Hold it there.!

701
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,002
Oh, my God, Mo', it's him, man.

702
00:38:01,037 --> 00:38:02,880
- How'd he find us?
- Leave that garbage!

703
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:04,912
- Let's just go, man. Let's just go.
- Don't... Wait up!

704
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:07,154
- You've got the gun.!
- Go! Go! Let's get out of here!

705
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:10,657
Wait! Don't go!
Don't go! Wait!

706
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:14,374
- That guy is demented.
- No, no, no, wait!

707
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,579
It's going!

708
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:18,427
Stop.! Stop.!

709
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,784
There's evidence in there.!

710
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:23,814
Stop. There's evidence in there!
Wait up!

711
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:26,438
Turn off the compactor!

712
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:39,286
Did Adrian Monk just jump into
a garbage truck?

713
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,851
Yeah.

714
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:14,678
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:18,461
Brown Merrills, ten and a half.

716
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:21,337
You get these off the driver you shot?

717
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:23,963
What else you got in the bag?

718
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,860
Beretta, a nine-millimeter.

719
00:39:30,895 --> 00:39:33,446
The savings and loan job in Delmare.

720
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:36,377
Do me a favor!

721
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:37,633
Do me a favor!

722
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,708
Resist! Go ahead, please!

723
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,726
Captain, don't.! Captain.

724
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:42,743
Don't do this.

725
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:44,861
Don't do this.
You'll lose your badge.

726
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,279
It's not worth it.

727
00:39:50,842 --> 00:39:53,123
You're right. He's not.

728
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,332
He's not worth it.

729
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,506
Arrest him.
Don't hurt him.

730
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:04,555
Mr. Coker, you're under arrest
for three counts of felony murder.

731
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,570
Get him out of here!

732
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:09,228
Read him his rights.

733
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:31,890
Hi!

734
00:40:32,152 --> 00:40:33,343
Hi!

735
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:36,977
- Mommy!
- Boys! Oh, my little sweeties.

736
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:40,336
Hi. Oh, I missed you so much.

737
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,549
I love you fellas.

738
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:44,862
Smile.

739
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:47,153
Oh, my... Where did you get that?

740
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:49,477
- I bought it.
- A digital camera!

741
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:51,252
Oh, Leland!

742
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:54,679
But we can't afford it, and the other
camera was not even insured.

743
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:56,485
- It's only money.
- "Only money"?

744
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,188
Yeah. - Who got hit on the head,
me or you?

745
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,235
That would be me.

746
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,048
Oh! Mmm!

747
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,337
Ew!

748
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:08,348
- I love you.
- I love you too.

749
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,847
Mmm.
