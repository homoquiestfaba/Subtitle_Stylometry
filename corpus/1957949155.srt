LA.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,755
I've been a lot of places,

9
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,125

this Los Angeles place,

13
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,271
it has the biggest price tag of 'em all.

[lighter flicks]

15
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,313
[Rouse] Maybe I've lost an angel,

16
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,517
but I don't think angels can be lost.

17
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,486
That's why they're angels.

[police sirens blaring]

19
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,332
[Rouse] No matter how you think you're hidden,

20
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,402
you're always where somebody can see you.

21
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,145
I gotta find out who I am.

22
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,882
I'm ready for anything.

You love this job, man.

30
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,022
Huh, who are you kidding?

And what about me?

36
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,770
You ain't got to worry about it, man.

37
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,673
-Your partner's always got your back. -That's right.

Yo, yo, what's up?

Out.

49
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,265
I tell you, you'd be better off to bet on the lottery.

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,336
At least you'd only lose a dollar. [laughs]

00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,534
Your nerves? What about mine?

59
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,603
Hey, come on. Give us a break.

You got a get-out-of-jail free pass.

Listen. I told you to quit bugging me, all right?

72
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,797

You ought to hear it, man. It speaks perfect German.

81
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,689
Should get 'em together with my Schnauzer.

you have been working for me less than a week.

461
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,970
And the first thing I told you is to be aware of everything around you,

462
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,139
everybody around you, not to go to the hotel by yourself,

463

and that's the first thing that you did!

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,875
And now look what happened!

465
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,943
I think there were cops involved.

466
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,580
[laughs] There was a fucking cop involved.

467
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,249

I'm gonna tell you to turn around,

to walk through that thing that's called a fucking door.

474
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,231
You're gonna get out of here!

475
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,501

00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,708
Fuck!

478
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,445
This quiet downtown hotel appears

479
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,880
to be the scene of multiple homicides.

480
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,750
In fact, there are four police detectives,

481
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,418
several unidentified men,

482
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,420
and a woman have been found dead inside

483
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,658
in what sources indicate has all the makings of a gangland style slaying.

484
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,260
Now, police officials won't confirm or deny this,

485
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,931
but one of the victims appears to be the prosecution witness

486
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,067
against the Teflon Don himself, Franco Nugentti,

487
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,336
he, of course, of the Faustino crime family.

488
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,939
He is being held on bond during one of the, well,

489
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:38,510
one of the most historic organized crime trials in the history of Los Angeles.

490
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:43,782
His son, Franco Jr., is said to be running the family business in his absence.

491
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,817
[JJ] So what time'd this happen?

492
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,288
-[Buzz] About 10:00, 10:15. -[Tyler] Jack was shot a close range.

493
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,793
Well, that doesn't make sense. How does a seasoned cop like Jack get shot at close range?

494
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,061
We can't figure it out.

495
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,230
So for someone to come in the room and get that close,

496
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,332
it would have to be his wife or his mother, right?

497
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,000
Or maybe a cop.

498
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,939
What? Come on. You know it happens sometimes,

499
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,408
you know, for the right price, I mean, it happened before, right?

500
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,078
Wait, wait, wait. I thought there was a dead woman found in that room?

501
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,514
[Tyler] Yeah. Hooker.

502
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,749
What's a dead hooker doing in the room?

503
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,086
Well, maybe Jack and Sid were doing the hooker.

504
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,259
What? You never had a hooker? I mean, come on.

505
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,060
Just 'cause you're happily married, it doesn't mean

506
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,096
you don't cheat on your wife. Right, Danny?

507
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,600
Are you ladies through, or should I leave and give you some more privacy.

508
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,235
-No, we're done. -[sighs]

509
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,105
[Lawlor] All right, here's the latest on the case.

510
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,111
Captain.

511
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,618
Let's get down to the business. You've read the report.

512
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,487
We're dealing with an inside job.

513
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,590
Okay. Backup arrived on time.

514
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,959
He was shot at close range, like Jack.

515
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,728
But the shooter wasn't a stranger.

516
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,098
It was done by a cop.

517
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,967
I hate this.

518
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,405
The dead girl was found with some mesh stockings...

519
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,342
...belonged to someone else. We ran the preliminary tests,

520
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,579
and they didn't match the hooker that was found dead on the scene.

521
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,913
Oh, shit.

522
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,249
Another hooker.

523
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:25,717
That's possible.

524
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,287
There's a witness that said they saw a half-naked woman

525
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,090
running from the hotel where the event went down.

526
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,228
[sighs] Now, if this mystery woman wasn't in on the hit,

527
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,365
maybe she knows the killer or the killers.

528
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,069
We've got some work to do here...

529
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,938
...and we're not gonna let it go...

530
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,108
...and we're not gonna have loose ends flapping in the wind.

531
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,845
Double J, Buzz, you're on the murder investigation.

532
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,947
You two...

533
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,782
...come with me.

534
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,820
By the way, you'll be happy to know

535
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,521
we have an ID on the mystery woman.

536
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,889
Her name is Angel.

537
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,992
I want an APB on her.

538
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,361
You go and find her, and you call me.

539
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,497
Use your cell phone. Do not call dispatch.

540
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:13,898
And don't bring her in.

541
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,802
As I said before, this is leaning to an inside job...

542
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,872
...so we need her testimony.

543
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,541
She remains safe.

544
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,243
I don't wanna lose her.

545
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,179
Well, after what happened to Paxton and Sid,

546
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,348
uh, I think the FED should handle this.

547
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,383
No, sir.

548
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,351
This is our collar.

549
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,389
Oh.

550
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,726
-This is for you, Tyler. -What's this?

551
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,895
Congratulations.

552
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,298
You have been deputized. You are US Marshals.

553
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,935
And you are my lead detective on this case.

554
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,106
The DA's gonna call us when to bring the witness to court.

555
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,276
And her testimony will be the final nail

556
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,245
in Nugentti's coffin.

557
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,881
Sir, Buzz is my partner, not Yordan.

558
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,783
I can't work with this guy.

559
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,584
I trust her with my life every day.

560
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,453
If you got a problem with Buzz, you got a problem with me.

561
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:12,257
I picked you two because you're the ones I trust on this.

562
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,925
You understand me?

563
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,863
And you are my best homicide detective.

564
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Yordan works vice.

565
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,236
He knows the street, and we're under the gun

566
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,338
to get this hooker before it's too late.

567
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,008
I'm counting on you.

568
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,247
I'm counting on you too. You're dismissed.

569
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,351
I like your suit.

570
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,121
You gonna wear it all the time?

571
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,025
"My, my, my." said the spider to the fly.

572
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,761
Buzz! Buzz! Samantha!

573
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,663
-What? -Jesus, hold up.

574
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,765
That little powwow up there where you were pulling the charade

575
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,000
about Jack wouldn't cheat on his wife.

576
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,169
Come on. We're supposed to be working together

577
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,004
and you can't be honest with me about that?

578
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,173
Look, JJ, you get off my back,

579
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,976
because I will not take these kind of insinuations from you.

580
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,611
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

581
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,979
Easy.

582
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,915
Let's just put our personal differences aside, okay?

583
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,417
This thing is a little bigger

584
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,319
than we all can imagine.

585
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,921
-Hey. -[scoffs]

586
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,924
She loves you.

587
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,695
What's tougher than one female blonde cop?

588
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,130
I don't know.

589
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,765
Two female blonde cops.

590
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,199
You like my jokes, right?

591
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,835
Four, five, six blonde cops.

592
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,338
[dramatic music]

593
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,675
[Yordan] So where do we go first?

594
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,411
Escort service or taxi company?

595
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,580
[Tyler] We start with the escort service,

596
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,915
find out what they know.

597
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,950
That's the best bet.

598
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,110
Detective Dan Tyler, LAPD homicide.

599
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,079
I'm sorry, but police night is on Saturdays.

600
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,614
I'd like to ask you a few questions

601
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,117
about a couple of your employees, Eve and Angel.

602
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,519
There's no Eve or Angel that works here tonight.

603
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,154
And besides, we're closed.

604
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,890
I'm sorry, if you can come back tomorrow or next week,

605
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,859
that would be great. I'm sorry, mijo.

606
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,128
That's just the way it is. Okay?

607
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,364
Well, hello, papi chulo.

608
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,567
[tense music]

609
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,069
You know this is a homicide investigation, right?

610
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,172
-No, I didn't get the invitation to that party. No. -[Yordan] Oh, you didn't know?

611
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,208
[Yordan] Did you know Angel was with her?

612
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,545
I don't know. What does that have to do with me?

613
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,981
I'm sure you do know. And I'm sure you can help us out

614
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,050
trying to find her. Right? Right?

615
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,920
Frenchy, nothing would make me happier

616
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,589
is to help you out.

617
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,023
How do you contact Angel?

618
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,259
I don't know how to get ahold of Angel,

619
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,827
because I don't know her phone number.

620
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,329
How do you reach Eve?

621
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,699
I don't know where she lives.

622
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,969
I'm... I don't even know where to find her.

623
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,407
Do you know what they do to pretty boys like you in prison?

624
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,511
-Well, hopefully, ugly things. -Oh, yes.

625
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,885
She is getting fucked every night at the pool hall

626
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,755
by Bill, the guy that owns the place, okay?

627
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,090
-Now-- -[Tyler] Bill what?

628
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,226
What am I, information all of a sudden?

629
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,061
Bill Jones, Bill Smith.

630
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,931
Oh, you're talking about the famous...

631
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,333
...Bill Slater, right?

632
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,471
Well, if he's famous for selling drugs

633
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,975
to underage children, then, ding!

634
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,646
Yes, the "famous," uh, Bill Slater.

635
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,813
I know where he is.

636
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,815
Thank you for coming tonight.

637
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,517
Oh, and one more thing.

638
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,588
Uh, when you guys walk, your asses seem a little bit tight,

639
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:07,058
so you may wanna get a massage on the way out.

640
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,128
I wouldn't mind, but you know my partner, you know how he is, right?

641
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,764
-I know how he is. And I know how you are. -There you go.

642
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,565
-Thanks for your help. -Wish you could stay.

643
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,334
[speaks in Spanish]

644
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,404
[upbeat rock music playing over speakers]

645
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,655
Listen to me.

646
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,124
I know how you're used to working,

647
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,359
and I don't like it.

648
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,127
Just let me question him.

649
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,497
Sure.

650
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,566
I'm looking for Bill Slater.

651
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,409
Bill Slater?

652
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,011
Who wants to know?

653
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,714
-LAPD. Homicide. -[chuckles]

654
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,786
Look, I've got some bad news. I don't have an easy way to say this,

655
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,955
but your girlfriend Eve was killed last night.

656
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,826
Angel was with her. We need to know how to get in touch with Angel.

657
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:15,860
I don't know shit.

658
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,328
You probably killed her.

659
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,300
Look. I know you're in contact with Angel.

660
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,901
Now tell me where she is.

661
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,336
I said I don't know shit.

662
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,173
What the fuck? [laughs]

663
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,676
I can bust you for narcotics for this.

664
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:32,610
Bust me.

665
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,580
[tense music]

666
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,684
[laughs]

667
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,357
He's not talking.

668
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,559
[background chattering]

669
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,061

[groans]

671
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,474
-Where is she? -[Bill groans] Fuck.

672
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,977
[Yordan] Where is she?

673
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,747
[screams] She's at the train station! [groans]

674

See?

[man groaning]

678
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,248
-You can lose your badge for that. -Sure.

[train horn blaring]

680
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,760
[ominous music]

[dog barks]

682

[sirens blaring]

683
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,547
[Yordan] You know, the hooker may have set up Jack and Sid.

684
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,785
-Yeah? What are you getting at? -I'm getting at we have to be careful with her.

685
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,020
If she's working for Nugentti...

686
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,591
...I'm telling you, it will take only one phone call

687
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,494
and we end up dead like Paxton.

688
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,096
[Tyler] Yeah, but if she's not working for him

689
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,798
and she IDs the hitter,

690
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,133
we could connect him to Nugentti,

691
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,367
and put 'em away for life.

692
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,602
It's worth the risk.

693
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,673
[Yordan] Look. It's her.

694
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,742
[Tyler] Get her.

695
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,712
[dramatic music]

696
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,786
Police! Stop.

697
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,456
-[Angel screams] -[Yordan grunts]

698
00:35:58,956 --> 00:35:59,891
I'm a cop.

699
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,298
[Tyler] Put her in the car.

700
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,535
[suspenseful music]

701
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,639
-[Yordan grunts] -Hey, hey, hey. Back off! Back off!

702
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:18,809
What the hell are you doing?

703
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,551
I'm detective Dan Tyler, LAPD homicide.

704
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,954
We're not here to arrest you, we just need to ask you a few questions.

705
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,623
Where were you last night at 10:00 p.m.?

706
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,425
I was at home.

707
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,260
You're lying.

708
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,265
We know you were in the hotel room.

709
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,934
We've got your stockings.

710
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:43,968
Talk to me.

711
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,371
Fine. I was there, but I didn't see anything.

712
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:48,773
Why did you run?

713
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,275
Because I was scared.

714
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,712
What were you doing?

715
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:55,813
Working.

716
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,749
I could arrest you right now for accessory to murder.

717
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,020
You better cooperate.

718
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,356
Fine. I saw him do it.

719
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,291
Saw who?

720
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,028
That mob guy that's always on TV.

721
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,632
Nugentti?

722
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,201
Why would he do it himself?

723
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,803
Guess he wanted something very bad.

724
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,972
Am I done now?

725
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,040
No.

726
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,582
[Yordan] Hey, it's 6:00 a.m. He should be in his office by now.

727
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,017
You better make the call.

728
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,454
[tense music]

729
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,788

730
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,457
[phone rings]

731
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,460
-Tyler. -We got the girl.

732
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,029
I'm proud of you.

733
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,431
Listen, it's very important. We need to get her

734
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,067
into a covert environment where she is safe.

735
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,272
Just meet us at the, the corner of Burbank and Van Nuys.

736
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,175
I'll be there in about, uh... 20 minutes.

737
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,477
Great.

738
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,379
[phone beeps]

739
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,092
Hey, you gonna get rid of that suit?

740
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,396
We are supposed to be undercover, you know?

741
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,465
[Tyler] Look, I'll change when we get to the safe house.

742
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,433
-[gunshots] -[Tyler] Damn!

743
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,701
[tires screech]

744
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,936
Holy shit, just back up. Back up!

745
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,806
Get down!

746
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,742
-[tires screeching] -[gunshots]

747
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,482

[gunshots]

750
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,091
-[Tyler] What the hell was that? -[Yordan] They must have followed us

751
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,426
from the train station.

752
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,962
[Rouse] Someone got to Tyler and Yordan.

753
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,532
I now know one of you is a traitor.

754
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,201
[suspenseful music]

755
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,304
[Rouse] And I will find out who it is.

756
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,708
So just know this, that I'm going to be watching

757
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,943
every one of you very closely.

758
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,414
So do your best to stay straight...

759
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,818
[sighs] and let's wrap this thing up...

760
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,887
...before it explodes inside the department

761
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,923
and we don't have a department anymore.

762
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,162
Hey, Lawlor. I hear Tyler got your case, huh?

763
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,798
Well, you know what they say, Bill.

764
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,633
Every dog has his day.

765
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,502
[people chattering]

766
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,870

767
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,939
-See you. -[Bill] See you later.

768
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,409
[ominous music]

769
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,447
[sighs] Empty.

770
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,862
[patrons chattering]

771
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,601
-Oh. Hi, Bobby. -How you doing?

772
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,035
Where's, uh, where's Frankie?

773
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,171
He's in the kitchen. Is something wrong?

774
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,540
Yeah. I got bad news for him.

775
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,876
Oh, he's already in a bad mood today.

776
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,681
-That's wonderful. -Good luck.

777
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,187
[suspenseful music]

778
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,221
Tomasino.

779
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,457
How we doing, buddy?

780
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,959
-[Tomasino] I... -Ah, come on.

781
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,262
You gotta move. You gotta mo-- This--

782
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,765
You gotta chop, fine, fine, fine, all right? This is very important.

783
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,500
There's 50 people in the banquet room.

784
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,736
We gotta take care of this. This is important to my father.

785
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,538
Do it again. Do it again.

786
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,373
Do it again. Come on.

787
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,109
[oil sizzling]

788
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,150
-What are you doing? -[Nugentti Jr] Come over here.

789
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,619
-[chuckles] What's going on? -What's going on?

790
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,288
I'm cooking. I'm behind schedule.

791
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,490
The guy who was supposed to show up didn't show up with him.

792
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,858
-[inaudible] -The smell. Look.

793
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,626
It smells good, like my mom's.

794
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,961
Your mom. I love your mom. How's she doing?

795
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,396
Do me a favor, take a look at this.

796
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,631
-Is that too oily? -No, no. It needs some olive oil.

797
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,733
What are you? A chef all of a sudden?

798
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,202
-What the fuck? You asked for my opinion. -Oh.

799
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,137
Keep your opinions to yourself. Don't curse.

800
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,139
I gotta go. I'm behind schedule. Get out of my way.

801
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,640
-What do you mean "behind the schedule"? -Get out of my way.

802
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,008
-What are you doing? -What am I doing?

803
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,310
I gotta chop the garlic, is what I'm doing.

804
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,411
The other kid didn't show up.

805
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,179
[Bobby] Which one? The bus boy?

806
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,481
[Nugentti Jr] Uh, what's his name?

807
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,851
Listen, uh... I couldn't find that thing.

808
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,155
-[chuckles] You couldn't find that thing? -I couldn't find that thing.

809
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,624
We looked in every fucking locker. Nothing.

810
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,528
Come here.

811
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,999
You get Jimmy, you get Tommy, you hear me?

812
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,502
You go back to those lockers, you find that thing.

813
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,172
-I'm sorry, I just-- -You don't fucking tell me you're-- Look at me.

814
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,242
[suspenseful music]

815
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,276
I want the money.

816
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:53,911
You find the money,

817
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,013
then you find the girl.

818
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,815
What about the cops?

819
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,351
Surprise me.

820
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,820
[suspenseful music intensifies]

821
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,724
Tomasino! [speaks in Italian]

822
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,092
[Bobby] I'll take care of it.

823
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,294
You okay?

824
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,162
[people chattering]

825
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,230

[tense music]

827
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:21,605
-[Yordan] What is this place? -[Tyler] I used to work out here when I was a kid.

828
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,241
It should be a safe place to talk.

829
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,351
Looks empty.

830
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,844
[gentle music]

831
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,122
What do we do now?

832
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,058
We wait.

833
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,227
Here?

834
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,463
No, we gotta find a safe house.

835
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,501
I know my rights. You can't keep me here like some kidnap victim.

836
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,204
[light suspenseful music]

837
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,710
You think you've been kidnapped?

838
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,479
You're in protective custody.

839
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,747
Without us, you'd be dead.

840
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,284
Yeah. Cops protecting me from cops.

841
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,988
How do I know you guys aren't a part of this thing?

842
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,357
You're still alive, right?

843
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,893
How many cops know I'm here?

844
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,428
Just us.

845
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,130
Oh, that's great.

846
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,466
So they sent you two fuck-ups to protect me?

847
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,202
You know what? You've got a hell of a mouth.

848
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,206
Give me the key.

849
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,809
Give me the key!

850
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,862
None of us wanna be here.

851
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,065
Then why don't you fucking let me go?

852
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,271
One of my best friends was killed in that hotel room.

853
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,741
For all I know, you were in on the hit that got him murdered.

854
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,309
So don't push me.

855
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,111
I don't fucking have to take this.

856
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,479
I want to get out of here.

857
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,018

[suspenseful music intensifies]

859
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,990
Back off.

860
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,026
I swear to God I'll shoot.

861
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,495
Yeah? You're gonna shoot me?

862
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,466
Back off! I mean it!

863
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,068
Yeah.

864
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,104
Go ahead.

865
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,373
Shoot.

00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,995
You should have told me.

870
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,240
If we wanted you dead,

871
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,175
we wouldn't be sitting here talking.

872
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,084
I'm here to make sure you don't get killed.

873
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,053
Maybe you want something from me.

874
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,324
What do you mean?

875
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,026
You're not here to protect me.

876
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,231
You're just here to keep me from escaping.

877
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:08,565
Angel.

878
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,969
Angel, listen to me.

879
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,104
Look, look at me.

880
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,177
If you fight us...

881
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,379
...if you try to escape...

882
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,581
...they'll find you.

883
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,552
We're your only chance to get out of this alive.

884
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,091
You need us as much as we need you.

885
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,603
I got a place where we can hide.

886

-Hello? -[Bobby on phone] Frankie?

889
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,324
-Yeah. -[Bobby on phone] They're on the move.

890
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,060
-Should I call your cop friend? -We got 24 hours.

891
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,995
Do you understand what's going on here?

892
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,731
This whole thing is gonna come crumbling down.

893
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,333
You better take care of this.

894
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,968
-[Bobby on phone] What about the hooker? -No.

895
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,170
-You know where she is? -[Bobby on phone] I'm on it.

896
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,574
And do me a favor, do not call me back until you take care of her,

897
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,142
and then you find my money.

898
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,211
They might be bugging this phone.

899
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,013
[tense music intensifies]

900
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,925
-[Tyler] Whose place is this? -That's Paula's place.

901
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,262
She's a flight attendant. You know how they are. They're always out of town.

902
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,197
But I got a spare key.

903
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,244
Is this place safe?

904
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,046
Of course, it's safe. It's one of my girlfriends.

905
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,181
I'm gonna check it out.

906
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,618
-Sure. -How long are you planning on keeping me here?

907
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,419
[Yordan] As long as it takes.

908
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,560
Just sit down and make yourself comfortable.

909
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,129
[Tyler] Only one window on the second floor.

910
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,667
It looks clear.

911
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,537
I'm starving. Are you at least gonna feed me?

912
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,407
She's right. Is there anything to eat here?

913
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,476
No, there's nothing in there. But you know what?

914
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,178
I know this great restaurant around the corner.

915
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,713
I don't eat meat.

916
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,716
She'll eat anything.

917
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,685
Screw you.

918
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:46,223
You making an offer?

919
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,992
There's not enough money in the world.

920
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,230
[Tyler] Yordan, just go get the food.

921
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,233
Sure.

922
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,538
Just watch her.

932
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,350
Your hamburger.

933
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,460
Hey, I think they found us.

934
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,332
[Angel] Hey, stop it!

935
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,903
What the hell are you doing, huh? That's my purse.

936
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,506
What? Are you gonna strip search me now too?

937
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,042
Sure. Can I?

938
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,677
Yeah. You bet.

939
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,146
Hey.

940
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,417
She's not dangerous. Hell, she had a gun

941
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,952
pointed right at you, couldn't pull the trigger.

942
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,154
She doesn't have to be a killer.

943
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,189
You're crazy.

944
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,326
You know, we still don't know how Nugentti got into the room,

945
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,062
and you know she could have distracted him.

946
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,230
No way.

947
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,232
Jack was a happily married man.

948
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,068
He wouldn't leave his post for some hooker.

949
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,304
Come on, man. Wake up and smell the coffee.

950
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,541
You know Paxton was doing Buzz.

951

[chuckles] What? You didn't know that?

952
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,381
Jesus, the whole department knew.

Look at her.

00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,659
You're telling me you don't want a piece of that?

[Yordan] There's a parking lot on the other side.

What we should do is go over there

1025

No, they didn't. But I think

the better their chances are of living.

1048
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,896
[tense music]

1049
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,632
Wait. In here.

1050
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,004
You know how to use this?

1051
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,540
Just point it and shoot.

1052
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,614
-[attacker 1] Hey, there he is. -[attacker 2] Get him!

1053
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,150
[suspenseful music]

1054
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,920
[gunshot]

1055
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,091
[groaning]

1056
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,666
[gunshots]

1057
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,273
[both groaning]

1058
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,516
[men grunting and groaning]

1059
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,551
-[neck snaps] -[groans]

1060
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,065
[men grunting and groaning]

1061
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:27,837
[screams]

1062
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,776
-Angel. -[gasps]

1063
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,746
It's okay.

1064
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,882
They're gone. Come on.

1065
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,325
[tires screech]

1066
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,629
Put the gun down. Get in.

1067
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,602
[Tyler] Nice work. How'd you get this?

1068
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,238
[Yordan chuckles] It was a piece of cake.

1069
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,510
I hope they don't find us again,

1070
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,280
because this is the last flight attendant that I know.

1071
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,182
[suspenseful music continues]

1072
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,166
[Yordan] Lock the door.

1073
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,105
Nice place.

1074
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,651
-I'll check the perimeter. -Sure.

1075
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,961
[gentle music]

1076
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,164
Hey. You have a family?

1077
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,099
What do you care?

1078
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,203
I have a son who lives in Arizona with his grandma.

1079
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,107
How old is your son?

1080
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:12,976
He's five.

1081
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,045
He has the most amazing spirit.

1082
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,081
He's really funny.

1083
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:23,653
He can walk into any room and he makes everyone laugh.

1084
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,498
-Looks good. -Do you think they're gonna find us here?

1085
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,967
That car was the last connection to the department.

1086
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,003
We should be safe.

1087
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,838
We left everything else behind.

1088
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,406
Yeah, like our toothbrushes

1089
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,540
and clean clothes.

1090
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,643
Well, I don't think Judy would mind

1091
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,444
if you borrow some of her things.

1092
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,313
-Okay. -Yeah.

1093
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,916
-Are you hungry? -[chuckles] Starved.

1094
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,253
Let's go into the kitchen.

1095
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,957
-Judy is a great cook. -[chuckles]

1096
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,764
[Tyler] Right about now, I could go for a big juicy steak.

1097
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:11,401
[Yordan laughs] What about the sweet little Pop-Tart?

1098
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,337
[ominous music]

1099
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,922
[buttons beeping]

1100
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,292
Hey, it's me.

1101
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,461
No, I can't talk long.

1102
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,464
[crickets chirping]

1103
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,433
[door slides open]

1104
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,841
You were right about Judy.

1105
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,844
Best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever had.

1106
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,284
Hey, where'd you get that accent?

1107
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:07,490
[scoffs] Hey, I'm just trying to make conversation.

1108
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,459
Then don't.

1109
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,164
You know what I said about your father?

1110
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,869
I'm sorry.

1111
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:21,871
You know what?

1112
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,976
When I was a kid, my father used to own this little store in the ghetto.

1113
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,580
He helped everybody.

1114
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,984
He always saw the good in people, no matter how bad they were.

1115
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,254
One day, some gang members showed up...

1116
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,156
...robbed him...

1117
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,325
...and they killed him.

1118
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,327
You know what?

1119
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,163
He died for a lousy 20 bucks.

1120
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,733
So after that, I decided to get out of there,

1121
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,802
and I became a cop.

1122
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,038
Here I am...

1123
01:02:58,841 --> 01:02:59,642
...a lousy cop.

1124
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,944
[melancholy music]

1125
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:16,025
Where'd you get that?

1126
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,593
Oh, leftovers in the fridge.

1127
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,529
You want a fortune cookie?

1128
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:28,905
[gentle music]

1129
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,339
What's your fortune say?

1130
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,009
I don't read fortunes.

1131
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,182
[Angel] "You will follow a hard and rigorous path

1132
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,217
towards enlightenment."

1133
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,352
They got the hard part right.

1134
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:54,230
[Angel chuckles]

1135
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,466
"A dark and brooding man

1136
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,969
will walk the path of happiness with you."

1137
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,306
Well?

1138
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,007
Well, what?

1139
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,577
Are you that dark and brooding man?

1140
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,346
I told you, I don't read fortunes.

1141
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,557
-Can I ask you a question? -Sure.

1142
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,495
What is a beautiful, intelligent...

1143
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,699
-...woman like you-- -Doing in this job?

1144
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,802
Yeah, I guess I'm not the first guy to ask you that question.

1145
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,437
It's not that bad, you know?

1146
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:36,906
Selling your body?

1147
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,241
You're a cop.

1148
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,675
So?

1149
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,946
Well, you and I kind of have the same problem. Don't you think?

1150
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,581
How do you figure?

1151
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,151
We both wanna forget what we do at the end of the day...

1152
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,289
...and I think I can, and I don't think you can.

1153
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,528
Well, at least I, um, can say

1154
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,964
I took the bad guys off the streets.

1155
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,503
-[ominous music] -[gun clicks]

1156
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,171
Goddamn!

1157
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,874
-Damn, you scared the shit out of me. -[exhales]

1158
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,243
-God, what are you-- -You miss your flight?

1159
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,213
-Well, the flight was canceled. -I'm sorry.

1160
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:20,249
-Oh! -I'm glad to see you, though.

1161
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,718
What are they doing here?

1162
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,122
[sighs] It's just a long story.

1163
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,124
Okay.

1164
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,660
I'm gonna go unwind.

1165
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,695
-Okay. -[chuckles]

1166
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,464
[gentle music]

1167
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:38,434
[door lock clicks]

1168
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,039
You're a pretty lonely guy, Danny.

1169
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,675
I bet you're divorced.

1170
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:47,710
Right?

1171
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,447
-Your wife couldn't handle the job? -[chuckles]

1172
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,282
I wish it was that simple.

1173
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,018
For the record...

1174
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,554
...my wife left me for another cop.

1175
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:01,691
Sorry.

1176
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,659
You learn to live with it.

1177
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:09,198
You know, I got caught up in the fast lane...

1178
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,005
...and I lost custody of my son.

1179
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,445
So I'm only doing this to make enough money to get him back.

1180
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,415
Pretty risky way to do it.

1181
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,519
Where does he live?

1182
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,257
He's in Arizona with his grandma.

1183
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,267
How did you get to be a cop?

1184
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,237
Runs in the family.

1185
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,473
My dad was a cop.

1186
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,409
Is he still on the force?

1187
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,582
[sighs] He's dead. He, um...

1188
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,617
...committed suicide.

1189
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,656
When, when he started out, he was, he was really a good cop.

1190
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,059
I mean, everything was by the book.

1191
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,161
But, um...

1192
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,264
...after my mom died, he, um,

1193
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,233
seemed like a different person.

1194
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,870
He was taking money on the side,

1195
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:23,672
he got investigated by internal affairs...

1196
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:28,711
...and one day, he just, uh, got in his car,

1197
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,646
drove it to Malibu,

1198
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,215
put in his favorite CD...

1199
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,686
...he took out his gun...

1200
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,791
....he put it to his head...

1201
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,533
[sensual blues music]

1202
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,889
[Angel breaths heavily] I can't.

1203
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,393
[sighs]

1204
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,295
What's wrong?

1205
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:03,966
I can't go through with this right now.

1206
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,670
[sensual blues music resumes]

1207
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,748

[Yordan] Where's the girl?

1221
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,670
Put your shirt on.

1222
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:23,906
Let's go.

01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,890
[Angel panting]

1227
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,928
[Angel screaming]

1228
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,464
No!

1229
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,501
[panting and groaning]

1230
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,103
No!

1231
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,406
[Yordan] I got the shot.

1232
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,141
No. No guns.

1233
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,075
It's too dangerous.

1234
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,678
[suspenseful music]

1235
01:13:03,612 --> 01:13:06,148
[Angel crying] No!

1236
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:08,817
[man grunting]

1237
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,522
[man groaning]

1238
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:17,326
[men grunting and groaning]

1239
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,762
[dramatic music]

1240
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,709
[men grunting and groaning]

1241
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,792
[police sirens blaring in distance]

1242
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,227
Let's go.

1243
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:55,564
Come on, let's go.

1244
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,570
[tense music]

1245
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,239
What the hell were you doing outside?

1246
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:05,941
I was just getting some air.

1247
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,980
Yeah, what were you doing out there?

1248
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,515
Thinking.

1249
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:14,950
About you.

1250
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,124
How come they didn't kill her?

1251
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,962
-I don't know. -She's hiding something from us.

1252
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,199
She must have something they want.

1253
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,537
[phone ringing]

1254
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,240
[phone beeps]

1255
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,909
[exhales] Phone.

1256
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,182
It's the phone.

1257
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,351
They've had us bugged the whole time.

1258
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,855
[Yordan] You mean Rouse had us bugged the whole time.

1259
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,559
It could have been anybody in the department.

1260
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:58,794
Anybody?

1261
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:01,530
Come on.

1262
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,769
He was my father's best friend.

1263
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:12,307
I know.

1264
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,382
Your dad is in a great place,

1265
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,217
and he's still with you.

1266
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,952
And you can call him to be with you.

1267
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,420
You can pray to him, you can laugh with him.

1268
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,990
He's not gone. He's still here.

1269
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:32,694
But you disappear when you are so sad...

1270
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,665
...over a loss that's not counted as a loss.

1271
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,969
It's counted as a higher moment in the evolution...

1272
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,672
...of what we call, what's that word?

1273
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,140
Uh, destiny.

1274
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,347
Let go of the pain and sadness, because it's selfish.

1275
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:55,984
Let's be selfless.

1276
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,154
When we're not thinking about ourselves so much, then we're...

1277
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:03,859
...understanding the reality of someone passing on and going to a better place.

1278
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:07,062
And I got good news for you. You're gonna see him again.

1279
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,934
You're gonna be with him again. And right now, he's looking after you.

1280
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,602
He's looking over you. He's not looking out for you,

1281
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,504
you have to out for yourself, but he's looking over you.

1282
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,806
He's proud of you. You're his son.

1283
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,112
[Tyler] I called Rouse.

1284
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,782
He wants us to meet him at the Old Valley Airfield.

1285
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,217
It's time to settle things.

1286
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,156
Are you all right?

1287
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,158
Did they hurt you?

1288
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,094
[gentle music]

1289
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,629
I'm sorry.

1290
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,099
It's just that I was worried about you.

1291
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,768
[stutters] I was afraid they might have killed you.

1292
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,209
Why don't you trust me?

1293
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,812
Should I?

1294
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:01,783
[sighs] I've been a cop too long, I just...

1295
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,834
[people chattering]

1296
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:24,373
Um... Uh... [sighs]

1297
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,276
-Hello. -Ciao, Rosie. How are you today?

1298
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,045
-Fine, thank you. -No, just a little bit. Just a little.

1299
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,347
-You look beautiful today. -Thank you very much.

1300
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,649
-You doing okay? -Yeah.

1301
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:35,017
You're doing a good job.

1302
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,451
-Thank you very much. -Appreciate it.

1303
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:37,919
[phone rings]

1304
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,454
-Excuse me a second. -Okay.

1305
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,756
-[phone beeps] -Hello.

1306
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,858
They're at the old airport.

1307
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:47,262
-What? -I want you to send your men in in a couple of hours

1308
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,998
and I'll be gone with the prize by then.

1309
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:52,834
[suspenseful music]

1310
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,343
[Nugentti Jr] That's not the deal, Rouse.

1311
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,778
That's not the deal.

1312
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,314
Fine, I'll be there.

1313
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,416
You be there.

1314
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,352
[phones beep]

1315
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,267
Come here. [sighs]

1316
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,970
Take care of Rouse.

1317
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,372
He's done.

1318
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,941
Do it.

1319
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,715
[Rouse whistling]

1320
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:41,249
Good evening, Captain.

1321
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,051
Good evening. Good evening, Buzz.

1322
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,720
I have something I wanna show you.

1323
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,556
-Oh, really? -You wanna s-- You wanna see it?

1324
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,392
-Come on. Let's go this way. -Sure. Let's go.

1325
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,761
Good to run into you. Uh...

1326
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:54,796
Oh! Sorry.

1327
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,767
-It's okay. -Oh, well. I stumble around sometimes when I'm nervous.

1328
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,102
I want you to know something...

1329
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:04,906
...that you have been inspirational to me in this operation.

1330
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,509
You're a lovely woman. When you stand up for yourself

1331
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:09,845
and what your beliefs are, it's very rewarding.

1332
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,849
So I have a gift to give you, and it starts with a hug.

1333
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,521
-[gunshot] -[Buzz groans]

1334
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:22,057
[suspenseful music]

1335
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:25,527
But I still love you.

1336
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,869
I gotta find out...

1337
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,172
[sighs] ...who I am.

1338
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,608
I'm ready for anything.

1339
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:44,980
Just bring it to me. I'm ready for anything, just bring it to me.

1340
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,383
[engine starts]

1341
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,027

1342
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,600
[chopper whirring]

1343
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:44,573
[Tyler] Stay in the car.

1344
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,184
How many clips you got?

1345
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,053
-Three. -Three.

1346
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:04,759
Where do you think you're going? He told you to stay in the car. You're safer in the car.

1347
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,728
-He's right. -Trust us.

1348
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,432
-We'll come back for you. -Okay. Be careful.

1349
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,268
[Yordan] I think she's mad at me.

1350
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,506
-Good luck. -[Yordan] Hey, don't shoot at me.

1351
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,642
I'm the guy with the green jacket.

1352
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,560
[tense music continues]

1353
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,934

1358
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,213

01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,415
[vehicle approaching]

1363
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,314
[whispering] I told you to stay in the car.

1364
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,583
-I heard gunfire. -[sighs]

1365
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,452
I'll come back for you.

1366
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:53,962
-[gunshots] -[groans]

1367
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:56,498

[man groans]

1369
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,444
-What are you doing here? -It's a long story, Dan,

1370
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,347
but I am not the model cop I used to be.

1371
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:19,654
Rouse convinced your dad and me to work with Nugentti Jr.

1372
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:22,657
But then Rouse started killing our own,

1373
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,359
and I bowed out.

1374
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:26,461
What are you talking about?

1375
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:28,763
Paxton.

1376
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,200
Rouse and Nugentti killed Paxton.

1377
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:34,636
What do we do now?

1378
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,139
Well, we kill Rouse and Nugentti.

1379
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:40,542
[chuckles]

1380
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,043
After you.

1381
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:46,214
[suspenseful music]

1382
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:56,724

[footsteps approach]

1385
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,903
You know, it didn't have to be this way.

1386
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,608
[gunshots]

1387
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,345
[Nugentti Jr] I want this girl alive.

1388
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,681
This Jap fuck is giving me a headache!

1389
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,650
-Put down your weapons. -[Nugentti Jr] All right, Danny.

1390
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,786
-[Tyler] Where's Rouse? -[Nugentti Jr] He's on his way.

1391
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:29,757
You got me. Take it easy. It's okay.

1392
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,026
Put your guns down, it's okay.

1393
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,696
All right? I'm gonna put it down.

1394
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:36,464
Slow.

1395
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:43,771
Good. Come on. What's it gonna take, Danny?

1396
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,940
Huh? How much? What's your price?

1397
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,510
I don't have a price.

1398
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,678
You got a price. Your father had a price.

1399
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:55,016
I got what you want, you got what I want.

1400
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,819
-What are you talking about? -I got the rat.

1401
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,054
I'll hand 'em to you on a silver platter.

1402
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:01,623
Just give me the girl.

1403
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:06,995
Dirty cops get caught sooner or later. No deal.

1404
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,631
You know, I'm sorry about your father.

1405
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:13,334
But it wasn't suicide.

1406
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:16,538
Rouse felt he was becoming a risk,

1407
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,339
so we had to do what we had to do.

1408
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:22,510
[dramatic music]

1409
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,313
-Now! -[gunshots]

1410
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:40,662
-[screams] -Don't you say a word.

1411
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,501
[grenade whistles]

1412
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,870
[grenade explodes]

1413
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,006
[groans]

1414
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:53,708
[gunshots]

1415
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,877
[groans]

1416
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,246
[sobbing]

1417
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,148
Jesus. Where's Yordan?

1418
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:03,218
Shit, I lost him, but he's called for backup by now.

1419
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,285
Goddamn it.

1420
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,020
[Nugentti Jr] Get the chopper. Let's go.

1421
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:07,922
-He's on my tail. Let's go. -All right.

1422
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,227
[Angel screaming and sobbing]

1423
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:16,030
-No, no, no, no! Come on, come on, let's go! -[Angel] No!

1424
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,132
[dramatic music continues]

1425
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:20,935
[gunshots]

1426
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,918
[chopper whirring]

1427
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,052
-[grunts] -Give me your gun!

1428
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,655
Get off me, motherfucker!

1429
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:23,731
You never learn, huh, Tyler? Don't take off, he's got my leg!

1430
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:26,934
[screams] Give me your gun!

1431
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,938
-Get him off! -[screams] Give me your fucking gun!

1432
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:32,774
-[JJ] Get him off! Get him off! -[grunting]

1433
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:35,376
[Nugentti Jr] Give me your fucking gun! Quick!

1434
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:39,814
[Nugentti Jr screams]

1435
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:42,583
[gunshots]

1436
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,925
[Yordan over radio] Land your helicopter right now!

1437
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,994
[screaming]

1438
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:56,164
[Yordan over radio] Put it down now!

1439
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:59,767
[dramatic music continues]

1440
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,547
[chopper whirring]

1441
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,416
[police sirens blaring]

1442
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,589
[gentle music]

1443
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,835
[police radio chattering]

1444
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,453
[birds chirping]

1445
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:54,989
[calm music]

1446
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:03,431
So what are you gonna do now?

1447
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,434
Well, after I go to Arizona...

1448
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:09,170
...I'm gonna live the rest of my life.

1449
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:13,875
Well, you got a fresh start, so don't blow it.

1450
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:17,545
Aren't you gonna stick around and see how it turns out?

1451
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,581
I'm still looking for that dark and brooding man.

1452
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:21,716
[chuckles]

1453
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,752
I'm not sure you'd be happy living on a cop's salary.

1454
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:28,756
Maybe we don't have to.

1455
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,159
We've got Nugentti's money.

1456
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,678
[tense music]

1457
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,794
[tense music intensifies]

1458
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,666
[calm music]

1459
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,565
[tense music]
