we can't go in April.

he won't be ready.

Oh, it's astronishing.

get me some more

the name of that kid

we went to Dalton with?

113
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,323
The one who got kicked out for
writing those dirty letters

114
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,791
to Miss Darcy?
- That was Adam Foresberg.

115
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,926
Adam never got kicked out.

116
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:48,894
No, I think he did.

117
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,462
No, his family
moved to Indonesia.

Oh, no, I know who
you're talking about.

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,667
always wore that mounty shirt.

121
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,703

Oh.

124
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,773
You mean Shawna do you wanna?

125
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,008
That is harsh.

126
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,942
But true.

127
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:04,943
Jude, would you
go in the kitchen

128
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,712
and get me some
more horseradish?

129
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,980
Help Lucille.

130
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:13,351
Her leg is bothering her.

131
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,487
Is she kidding
with that pink hair?

132
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,254
Still?

133
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,322
Like she's so punk?

134
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,490
This steak is not good.

135
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,524
Where's it from?

136
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,559
...[inaudible] just
got it at Siderello.

137
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,561
Tell her to go into
town from now on.

00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,863
Farmer's market.

139
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,364
You're welcome.

140
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,366
I really think it was Adam
Foresberg who got kicked out.

141
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,868
It wasn't Adam Foresberg?

142
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,269
No, you're thinking
of Warren Wilson.

143
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,938
I am thinking of Warren Wilson.

144
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,506
You couldn't pay me to
go back to high school.

145
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,108
You hardly went, even when
you were in high school.

146
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,177
How's the restaurant, Corinne?

147
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,479
Oh, name a problem,
we've got it.

148
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,482
I've got a sous chef trying to
undermine my executive chef,

149
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,352
the wait staff are
like paint in place,

150
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,221
bartenders are thieves... I
swear, it's like a Mamet play.

151
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,256
They steal.

152
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,824
How exactly is that
like a Mamet play?

153
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,225
What's paint in place?

154
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,628
Speaking of Mamet, did anyone
see that actress on "The View?"

155
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,762
Which actress?

156
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,164
You know, the one that
was fat, and then got

157
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,599
thin, and then got fat again.

158
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,566
Anyone ready for more wine?

159
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,568
Oh, I am.

160
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,471
Oh, right.

161
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,473
Sorry.

162
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,821
Which lawsuit is
this one, again?

163
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,823
It's against this
Dutch record company.

164
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,559
Put out an LP of my
stuff, unauthorized.

165
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,494
No one calls them
LPs anymore, Paul.

166
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:33,064
Jude sang backup, so
they want to depose her.

167
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,201
So, uh, how long
are you staying?

168
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,069
Um...

169
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:38,870
What?

170
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,938
What did I say?

171
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,806
Uh, no... uh, nothing.

172
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,509
It's just that, um, things
are a little bit complicated

173
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,212
for me at the moment.

174
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,313
Real estate wise.

175
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,315
She's getting kicked
out of her apartment.

176
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,050
I'm not getting kicked out.

177
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,885
I'm simply having a
dispute with my landlord.

178
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:57,222
She's disputing the
notion she should pay rent.

179
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,590
And you're going to
move in with Paul?

180
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,358
No.

181
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,159
No.

182
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,928
No?

183
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,230
No.

184
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,898
I just need to get out
of the city, you know?

185
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,567
It's smothering me.

186
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,869
Well, I mean, you
could say with us.

187
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,570
We've got tons of space.

188
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,639
You know what, it's funny... I
always forget you guys actually

189
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,608
have your own place,
since, you know,

190
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,176
you're always here at Paul's.

191
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,912
Well, you know, it's nice
to have your own place.

192
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,647
I can't keep track
of these lawsuits.

193
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,049
All frivolous, of course.

194
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,785
And Paul keeps the East Hampton
Bar Association in pinstripes.

195
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,619
That's true.

196
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,220
I hate that so much.

197
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:29,988
Pinstripes?

198
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,089
That you call me Paul.

199
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,158
You should call me Pop.

200
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,125
You know, I'd love that.

201
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,227
Then why did you
name me Starshadow?

202
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,762
Starshadow's a wonderful man.

203
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,697
Wait.

204
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,765
Aunt Jude's real
name is Sarshadow?

205
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,701
David.

206
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,703
That's my luck, to be born
during his hippie period.

207
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,739
What if you'd been born
during my jazz phase,

208
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,075
and I had to call you Mingus?

209
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,510
Who goes through their hippy
period in the mid '80s, anyway?

210
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,212
Good question, Mingus.

211
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,580
David.

212
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,148
David, will you go upstairs
and get ready for bed, please?

213
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,949
It's past your bedtime.

214
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:58,983
I don't want to.

215
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,118
Come on, buddy.

216
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,886
I never minded you
changing your first name.

217
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,354
It's the last name
that bothers me.

218
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,856
You're not proud
to be a Lombard?

219
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,158
You changed it from Lipman.

220
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,426
Talk about pride.

221
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,161
You've been pretending to
be Italian all these years

222
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,563
when you're really Jewish.

223
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,764
I never said I was Italian.

224
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,066
If people think that,
it's their business.

225
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,836
Speaking of, if we could
put aside for a moment

226
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:21,473
Jude's contempt for her
lineage, I have an announcement.

227
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,716
I'm going to cut a record.

228
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,752
That's great.

229
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,553
Uh, album or single?

230
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,755
Single for know.

231
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,858
If it does good, Alan says
there's a chance an LP.

232
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,526
No one calls 'em LPs anymore.

233
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,595
Uh, what's it called?

234
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,663
"When I Live My
Life Over Again."

235
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,765
That's a bad title.

236
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,832
Uh who wrote it?

237
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,633
Me.

238
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,901
It came to him in the car.

239
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,670
We were driving back from
Foxworth's, and kaboom, it

240
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:53,905
come to me, out of the sky.

241
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,774
That's what the great
songwriters say,

242
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,143
that their songs come
to them fully formed.

243
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,378
That's what Mozart said.

244
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,482
That it felt like he was
taking dictation from God.

245
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,784
Huh?

246
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,552
I'm not comparing myself to
Mozart, I'm only saying...

247
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,853
You're just comparing
yourself to God.

248
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,956
I was driving, it was
coming to me so fast.

249
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,591
I just said it out loud.

250
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,393
Lucille wrote it down.

251
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,762
But you're not really
known as a songwriter.

252
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,863
What does it say?

253
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,698
The two skills are related.

254
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,301
Gershwin, Porter, Rodgers and
Hart, the great songwriters

255
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,171
were not also necessarily
the best interpretations

256
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,472
of their own stuff.

257
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,075
For that you need Sinatra,
Ray Charles, Billie Holiday.

258
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,510
Billie Holiday wrote
"Strange Fruit."

259
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,745
No she didn't.

260
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,480
A middle aged Jewish man
named Abe Meeropol wrote it.

261
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,448
What is it with you and
Judaism all of a sudden?

262
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,350
I was a vocal stylist.

263
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:43,188
Did anybody complain that Brando
didn't write his own lines?

264
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,156
It's not enough for
Olivier to be Olivier?

265
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,826
Since when do you have an
issue with Billie Holiday?

266
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,494
I don't have anything
against Billie Holiday.

267
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,795
I love Billie Holiday.

268
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,796
Singers were never expected
to write their own stuff.

269
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:52,630
She just didn't
write "Strange Fruit."

270
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,065
Not until Lennon and McCartney.

271
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,100
Well, I think Billie
Holiday is incredible.

272
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,969
And no one's arguing
with you, Corinne.

273
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,637
I think she's incredible, too.

274
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,239
In fact, I think a
lot of people are

275
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,941
incredible who,
like Billie Holiday,

276
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,342
did not write "Strange Fruit."

277
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,445
It says here "Strange Fruit"
was written by Lewis Allen.

278
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,113
That is a pseudonym
for Abe Meeropol.

279
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,216
Also, I did write
songs over the years.

280
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:14,419
I co-wrote, I collaborated
without credit.

281
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,654
I'm not saying that at my age
I'm going to be Burt Bacharach.

282
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,656
Excuse me.

283
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,728
I happened to write this one.

284
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,830
So, uh, could we hear it?

285
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,036
Yep.

286
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,837
Down.

287
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,305

(SINGING) If life is
nasty, brutish, and short,

290
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:57,256
and all this too shall pass,
can we conspire and consort

291
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,767
to make the good times last?

292
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,906
If youth is wasted on
the young, and it is,

293
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:15,908
and time goes by too fast, if
second chances go and come,

294
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:23,788
or too, too much to ask.

295
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:31,790
Oh, if... if I'd been
born in Hindustan,

296
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:37,068
I'd reincarnate
like the Hindus can.

297
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,171
I'll tell you, sir,
I've got a plan,

298
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:46,110
when I live my life over again.

299
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,448
I'm all warmed up,
and limber now.

300
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,953
Next time, I swear I'm
going to make it count.

Regrets, yes, I've had a few.

Perhaps I forgot to mention, but

Take it home.

307
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:28,987
So as a dress rehearsal,
this one's been fine.

308
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:33,791
But now I'm going to
go for real this time,

309

and smell the red roses when I'm
living my life all over again.

00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,668
"Dark and Lonely" is
a wonderful record.

364
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,939
You know, there's no single.

365
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,709
It's gonna be the
beginning of my next act

366
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,611
to reclaim my place.

367
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,416
I'm glad.

368
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,185
What?

369
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,787
What?

370
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,789
You don't sound enthusiastic.

371
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,591
I'm glad sounds like
a prelude to a but.

372
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,593
No but.

373
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,331
It's just that...

374
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,165
There you go.

375
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,634
You're nothing if not critical.

376
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,901
I was just going
to say that it's

377
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:15,439
a shame it has to be motivated
by such... I don't know,

378
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,574
bitterness.

379
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,609
It's called drive, and
you could take a lesson.

380
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,577
A driving lesson?

381
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,045
You're hilarious.

382
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,547
You could do comedy
as part of your act.

383
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,116
And by the way, you're right.

384
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,455
Why wouldn't I be... look
at where I'm living.

385
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,590
You live in the Hamptons.

386
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,992
Yes, the slums of the Hamptons.

387
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,261
We're not even on the
beach side of the street.

388
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,697
I had to cut the woods
back to three days a week.

389
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,566
I had to get rid of the
gardener and the pool guy.

390
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,902
At my age, it's not good.

391
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,004
And I notice, you
never turn down

392
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,840
a hand out from the old
family treasure chest,

393
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:50,962
miss soon to be homeless.

394
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:59,884
Speaking of, you could take
your own advice, career-wise.

395
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:00,718
Please.

396
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,986
I don't want to do this, Paul.

397
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:02,787
Just save it.

398
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,422
You have a wonderful talent.

399
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,657
I mean, why don't you
do something with it?

400
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,792
What about Pussy Fart?

401
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,460
It's a punk rock
thing you dabbled in.

402
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,561
Post punk.

403
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,962
And I did not dabble in it.

404
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,464
It was my full time job
for nearly two years.

405
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,132
Stop.
You were the bass player.

406
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:15,966
Meaning what?

407
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,003
The bass is a big, ugly thing.

408
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,172
You know, for a
girl it's unseemly.

409
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,907
That is so fucking sexist.

410
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,442
Oh, Jude, don't work blue.

411
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,877
You know, cursing means you
don't know what you're talking

412
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,713
about, said Thomas Aquinas.

413
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,881
You know, there are a lot
of great female bassists.

414
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,550
Kim Gordon, Kim Deal.

415
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:33,517
Kim Jong Il.

416
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,419
And I sang backup, too.

417
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,121
Kim Jong Il.

418
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,656
I sang backup, too.

419
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,758
Yeah, that's not backup to me.

420
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,593
It's like cats screaming.

421
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,828
Jesus.

422
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,397
You know, I noticed that
your contempt for our music

423
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:49,300
didn't stop you from
banging our drummer.

424
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,235
Why do you bring that up?

425
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,704
It's spilled milk
under the bridge.

426
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,106
For you.

427
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,308
So, you're holding
up this punk band

428
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,778
as evidence of your...
your focus on success.

429
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,048
OK, I didn't say that we were
your close personal friends,

430
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,585
the Beatles, but yeah,
by punk standards

431
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,587
we were moderately successful.

432
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:10,554
Yeah.

433
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,622
Post punk.

434
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,457
How many albums did
this band put out?

435
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,159
That is not a fair yardstick.

436
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,161
For the record.

437
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,431
- One.
- What label?

438
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,499
And an EP.

439
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,566
What label?

440
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,467
Chlamydia.

441
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,602
That's not a label.

442
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,904
Anything run out of a
garage is not a label.

443
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,473
In publishing it's what
we call vanity press.

444
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,108
Now you're an expert on
the publishing industry?

445
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,010
I'm an expert on
the music business...

446
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,078
Or is it the vanity part of it?

447
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,246
Hey, I know the difference.

448
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,080
Classic.

449
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,115
When you do it, it's boutique.

450
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,617
When I do it, it's vanity.

451
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,219
Like the man said,
I've forgotten more

452
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,822
about the business
than you'll ever know.

453
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:45,923
Hell of a pep talk.

454
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,525
Thank you.

455
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,895
Yeah, boost my confidence
by insulting me?

456
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,430
No, I'm not doing that.

457
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,531
I'm... I'm trying to help.

458
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,667
Doesn't matter what
you were trying to do.

459
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,135
Stay.

460
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,705
You know, don't... come on.

461
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,007
Keep me company.

462
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,009
I'll be dead soon.

463
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,061
Good morning.

464
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:24,862
How you doing?

465
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:26,664
Good morning, Mr. Paul.

466
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,366
Going to play golf,
in case anybody cares.

467
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,977
So do you really think Dad
has a chance for a comeback?

468
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,913
If you're asking me if I'm
worried about him, yeah.

469
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,281
I'm worried.

470
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,650
I'm worried he's going
to fall on his face.

471
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,753
Mm, well, he's a grown up.

472
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:23,821
Sort of.

473
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,789
I mean, didn't you
find Dad's last album

474
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,758
just a little bit twee?

475
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,493
You know what I find twee?

476
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,828
Using the word twee.

477
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,298
I'm just saying we've been
down this comeback road before.

478
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,701
Need I remind you of the
infamous reggae experiment?

479
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,704
No, please don't.

480
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,605
There you all are.

481
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,307
House is completely empty.

482
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,909
I was afraid you'd
been raptured.

483
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,443
Hey, Alan.

484
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,778
Hey, Jude.

485
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,079
Oh gosh, it never gets old.

486
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:49,947
You sure?

487
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,782
Where's Paul?

488
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,217
Playing golf.

489
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,152
What does he play,
36 holes a day?

490
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,688
Paul loves his holes.

491
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,123
Where is that Lucille, anyway?

492
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,257
Follow the smell of sulfur.

493
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,125
Hey!

494
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,459
David!

495
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,094
Come over here, and let me
show you how to handle an axe.

496
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,596
I don't want to.

497
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,730
Come on!

498
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,799
Please, will you... will
you just do it for me?

499
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,267
So what brings you out
here, anyways, Alan?

500
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,704
I have these documents
from the DMI lawsuit

501
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,940
that I need Paul to sign.

502
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:17,274
I thought that was
settled already?

503
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,610
No, there's two DMI lawsuits.

504
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,578
This is a different one.

505
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,813
You're like a
crack dealer, Alan.

506
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,014
You've got Paul hooked.

507
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,550
Please, your father
needs no encouragement

508
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,618
in the legal realm.

509
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,219
I don't need the
money, and I certainly

510
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,487
don't need the ass pain.

511
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,288
I know how to do it.

512
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,723
When's he getting back?

513
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,124
Around dinner.

514
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,726
Do you want to stay and join us?

515
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,127
I'm cooking.

516
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,197
Which means she's buying food,
and Lourdes is heating it up.

517
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,233
Why do I even need to
know how to chop wood?

518
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,034
ALAN: What time?

519
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:44,969
7:00-ish.

520
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,103
I'm there.

521
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,772
Gives these to your pop
when he gets back, OK?

522
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,908
Yes.

523
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,611
It's not gonna work like that.

524
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,412
I mean, it's OK for practice.

525
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,413
Hey.

526
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,214
Psst!

527
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,282
This is right up your alley.

528
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,083
Trust me.

529
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,084
Come here.

530
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,051
What?

531
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,252
Did you ever sleep with Alan?

532
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,287
What?

533
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,622
Oh, god, don't be
ridiculous, Corinne.

534
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,422
Alan's gay.

535
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,257
Alan is not gay.

536
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,226
Alan is so gay.

537
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,595
He's just of the closet
dwelling generation.

538
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,031
Either way, did
you sleep with him?

539
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,367
No.

540
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,369
I already told you.

541
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Once.

542
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:26,143
Jesus, Jude.

543
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:31,248
I mean, I remember when
movie stars were sort of lewd.

544
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,517
But when did he get...
when did he get sculpted?

545
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,085
I'm just saying,
it's a tradition

546
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,420
in music to change your name.

547
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,122
Reinventing yourself, you know?

548
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,757
Ask Bobby Zimmerman.

549
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,261
I lived in London through
the '70s, right on Kings Road.

550
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,964
Now men are being subjected to
the same unreasonable standards

551
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,165
that women have been for years.

552
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,400
I knew all the stars.

553
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,902
Then when I come to Hollywood,
I want to be discrete,

554
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,638
but we used to get around,
party, party all the time.

555
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,873
I could tell you stories.

556
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,341
But athletes, too.

557
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,911
Have you seen
Rafael Nadal's arms?

558
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,846
A lot [inaudible] those arms.

559
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,549
You know, I used to be so
in love with [inaudible].

560
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,818
The greatest name change in
music history is Nina Simone.

561
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,619
David?

562
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:10,187
Not at the table, plaease.

563
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,121
Big, smart beast.

564
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:11,922
Right.

565
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:12,723
Alan.

566
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,124
Ooh.

567
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,492
California was the place.

568
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,794
In those days... it still is.

569
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:17,594
California.

570
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,264
Blah, blah, blah.

571
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,166
I played tons of
gigs at the Lava.

572
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh, the Lava.

573
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,334
Do not make me count to five.

574
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,236
It was the house band,
practically... bar tab

575
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,371
like you could not conceive.

576
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,172
Alan, right?

577
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:29,640
Oh, yeah.

578
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,575
Three.

579
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,876
The Lava's going strong.

580
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,078
Still.

581
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,814
I tried to introduce Jude
to John and Fiona there,

582
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,749
but of course, she said no.

583
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:39,917
Fi...

584
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,151
Why don't you bust
Corinne's balls for a while?

585
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,886
Cause Corinne can't sing.

586
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,156
True story, when your
father went into [inaudible],

587
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,759
Seagram's stock
dropped 20 points.

588
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:49,560
It's on Wikipedia.

589
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,228
It's not an exaggeration.

590
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,396
I can too sing.

591
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,464
A little.

592
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,631
Hey, Jude, are you
still into Nina Simone?

593
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,434
Like, you used to listen
to her 24/7, or whatever.

594
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,503
I used to play
ping pong with Nina.

595
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,404
She was ferocious.

596
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,306
Nina Simone's a god.

597
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,608
Period, dot, end of sentence.

598
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,043
Quick story about the Lava.

599
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,311
Tell us.

600
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,147
One day during the '80s,
I'm standing outside the Ivy,

601
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:13,650
and this girl comes up...
young, good looking... big rack.

602
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,153
And she says, uh, I
have to thank you.

603
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,020
And I'm thinking...

604
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:17,988
Hey, that's not fair.

605
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,823
When we first danced
at our wedding,

606
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,059
it was one of my songs,
and she says, for paying

607
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,193
for my college education.

608
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,496
I'm Charlie Steinman's daughter.

609
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:28,232
He owns the Lava Lounge.

610
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,200
It's a true story.

611
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:31,001
You can't make this up.

612
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,269
Nope.

613
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,804
You know, I think it slightly
invalidates your status

614
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,539
as a recovering
alcoholic when all you do

615
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,174
is brag about what a
big drinker you were.

616
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,108
I'm not bragging.

617
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,476
It's a true story,
from my memoir.

618
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,812
And that would've been
when you were very young,

619
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,547
and before Jude was born, right?

620
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,116
Neither of us were
born yet, Alan.

621
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,351
And I would have
been first, anyway.

622
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,418
I always do that.

623
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,620
Yeah, I always forget
that you're older.

624
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:50,420
Everyone thinks that.

625
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,523
Because of the lines.

626
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:55,926
Dad, why don't you record
one of those duet albums?

627
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,060
That would be
really good for you.

628
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,162
I've been saying
that for years.

629
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,797
- I've thought about that.
- Yeah.

630
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,597
Paul, awesome idea.

631
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,799
Yes.

632
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,600
I can't wait to buy your
next album from Starbucks.

633
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,669
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad.

634
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,470
Oh.

635
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,038
Oh, I'm sorry, Jude.

636
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,307
God forbid Dad does
anything commercial.

637
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,276
Hey, why don't you take a
sad song, and make it better?

638
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,443
How about this, Paul?

639
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,078
Why don't you just record
all your parts now,

640
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,282
so when you're dead, Corinne can
just put out an album with you

641
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,817
and whoever's the
flavor of the month?

642
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,185
That is not a bad idea.

643
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,120
I love that idea.

644
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:23,921
That is a great idea.

645
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,055
That is a terrible idea.

646
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,424
Why not just shoot me,
throw me in the trunk,

647
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,359
and haul me off to the boneyard.

648
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,260
Hey, don't tempt me.

649
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,628
Don't tempt me.

650
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,631
I'm just saying, you don't want
to be one of those nostalgia

651
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,833
acts, do you?

652
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,967
Mademoiselle Super Nag.

653
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,535
Maybe that's what
the audience wants.

654
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,804
Hey, this is what
we're talking about.

655
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,639
You can have all
the success... money,

656
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:46,577
fame up the wazoo... but the
thing you cannot buy is new.

657
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,546
I don't care who you are, sooner
or later you're going to be old

658
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,982
news, and that's not to
say that you're less good,

659
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,818
your fans will desert you...
thought some of them will...

660
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,789
I'm saying you cannot
make it happen again.

661
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:01,592
Not the same way.

662
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:02,593
Shockingly wise.

663
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,393
Thank you.

664
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,495
It's also total bullshit.

665
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:09,299
I mean... I mean, just
because you're not... sorry.

666
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,267
But it is.

667
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,969
Just cause you can't
be something new

668
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,937
doesn't mean you can't
do something new.

669
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,440
I'm doing something different.

670
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,542
I'm recording a song
that I wrote myself.

671
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,411
It's a different kind of new.

672
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,114
Jude, would you clear
the plates, please?

673
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,382
What am I, Cinderella?

674
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,516
I got it.

675
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,851
Finish up this flan.

676
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,058
David.

677
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,928
This is for you.

678
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,529
Miss September.

679
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,665
Check it out.

680
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,533
She was a friend.

681
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,470
I could tell you stories.

682
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:50,641
It's an old magazine,
but, you know...

683
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,743
Uh, OK.

684
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,478
Thanks, Pop Pop.

685
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Don't mention it.

686
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,982
I mean that.

687
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,818
Don't mention it to anybody.

688
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,553
OK, let's start
at the beginning.

689
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,122
So the first one
was your mom, right?

690
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,323
No.

691
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,058
No, his first wife was the
high school sweetheart.

692
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,859
They were only like, 18.

693
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,727
They lived in Ho-Ho-Kus.

694
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:11,728
The ho of Ho-Ho-Kus?

695
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,398
She divorced him
before he was famous,

696
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,934
when he was still a
Lipman, out on the road

697
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,201
with the Moonlighters.

698
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,704
Our mom had barely left
Bolivia when they got married.

699
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,707
Mick Jagger had a
Latina supermodel wife,

700
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,809
so Paul figured he
had to do the same.

701
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:26,977
Wait, Jerry Hall was Latino?

702
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:30,213
And the third wife... of
course, she whose name

703
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:33,083
we do not speak...
the au pair who broke

704
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,584
up his marriage to our mom.

705
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:35,953
Oh, she didn't break it up.

706
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,021
She just happened to be
there when the roulette

707
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:39,256
wheel stopped spinning.

708
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,657
I can't even remember
the fourth one.

709
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,458
Sure you do.

710
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,893
Crazy cosmetics heiress.

711
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,395
You know, the,
um... the... the one

712
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,597
that he eloped with to Vegas.

713
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,834
Wait, so then, number five?

714
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,669
The stripper with
the 10 gallon tits.

715
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:53,971
Pride of Dallas.

716
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,372
It's Fort Worth.

717
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,874
People down there get
upset when you mix them up.

718
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:58,709
That's true.

719
00:32:58,711 --> 00:32:59,710
Chastity.

720
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:00,510
What?

721
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,545
Chastity was her name.

722
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:02,779
That was her name.

723
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:05,882
You know what's shocking,
is that marriage lasted

724
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,084
longer than all the others.

725
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,385
Chastity was good.

726
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,053
I liked her.
- She was.

727
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,588
I mean, she actually
stayed with Mom

728
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,156
when she was in the hospital.

729
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,792
She was there for your
mom, even up to the end.

730
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,527
Yeah, she really was.

731
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,362
Sure.

732
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,763
What are we talking about?

733
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:20,831
- Nothing at all.
- Nothing.

734
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,665
Nothing.

735
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,767
Hey, Paul, what do you think?

736
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:24,968
You got another song in ya?

737
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,036
What'll it be?

738
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:26,903
Sondheim.

739
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,071
Rodgers and Hart.

740
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,239
- Randy Newman.
- No!

741
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,240
Billy Joel!

742
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,341
"Uptown Girl."

743
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,478
Jude, come on up and
sing, like days gone by.

744
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,278
Go on.

745
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,079
Do it.

746
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,247
When the world was young.

747
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,749
Get up there.

748
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,083
Ambush.

749
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:40,951
What is this?

750
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,452
- [inaudible].
- Come on, Jude.

751
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,353
Do it.

752
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,355
Come on, Mingus.

753
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:47,758
Come on.

754
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,725
Scoot over.

755
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:49,793
OK.
You're gonna sit?

756
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:50,795
All right.

757
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,000
[piano music]

758
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,943
(SINGING) I know
I'd stand in line

759
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,146
until you think
you have the time

760
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,114
to spend an evening with me.

761
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,320
And if we go
someplace to dance, I

762
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:20,223
know that there's a chance
you won't be leaving with me.

763
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:28,698
And afterwards we'd drop
into a quiet little old place

764
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,033
and have a drink or two.

765
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,941
And then I'd go and spoil it
all by saying something stupid,

766
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,876
like I love you.

767
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:47,818
I'd practice every day to
find some clever lines to say

768
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,186
to make the meaning come true.

769
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:57,694
But then I think I'll wait
until the evening gets late,

770
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:58,776
and I'm alone with you.

771
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,602
The time is right, your
perfume fills my head,

772
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,538
the stars get red, and
oh, the night so blue.

773
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,779
And then I go and spoil
it all by saying something

774
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,682
stupid, like I love you.

775
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:23,687
Woo!

776
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:24,855
Dad.

777
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:25,857
Woo!

778
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,608
(SINGING) The time is right,
your perfume fills my head,

779
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:50,347
the stars get red, and
oh, the night so blue.

780
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:55,385
And then I'd go and spoil it
all by saying something stupid,

781
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,853
like, I love you.

782
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,525
I love you.

783
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:09,299
I love you.

784
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,300
Woo!

785
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:12,302
That was Paul Lombard, guys!

786
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,270
Dad.

787
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,771
Paul Lombard!

788
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,773
God.

789
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,441
Pauly, Pauly.

790
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,242
Wonderful, Paul.

791
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,244
Woo!

792
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,750
He really can't
help himself, can he?

793
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,193
You know, I really don't want
to be another person telling

794
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,060
you how to live your life.

795
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,228
And I appreciate that, Alan.

796
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,297
Then why don't you let
me help you out a bit?

797
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,165
Do you really want to
be somebody recording

798
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,967
jingles the rest of your life?

799
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,136
Maybe.

800
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:47,771
Don't be coy.

801
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,272
I mean, it's fine
if you want to,

802
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:53,743
but I guess that's what
I'm asking, is do you?

803
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,445
Why don't you let me help you?

804
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,514
Because I can take
care of myself.

805
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,316
Can ya?

806
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,184
Don't be a dick, Alan.

807
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,285
Let me make a couple calls.

808
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,020
You know, set up some
meetings, and let's

809
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,303
see if we can avoid you
having to move in with Paul.

810
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,762
If you want to do
that, I can't stop you.

811
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,997
But I'm not asking you.

812
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,132
It's all me.

813
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,134
All my idea.

814
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,839
MAN ON PHONE: Did you call
my home number last night?

815
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,773
Well, yeah, but I...

816
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,342
MAN ON PHONE: Are
you crazy, Jude?

817
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,476
I...

818
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,078
MAN ON PHONE: My wife's
not an idiot, you know?

819
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,240
She is a lot of things,
but she's not an idiot.

820
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,972
I couldn't get through
to you on your cell.

821
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,857
I needed to talk to you.

822
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,259
MAN ON PHONE: Where
are you, anyway?

823
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,294
I'm at my dad's place.

824
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,197
MAN ON PHONE: Now, what the
hell are you doing there?

825
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,933
Ugh, it's a long story.

826
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,368
MAN ON PHONE: We
talked about this.

827
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,670
It's not a healthy
environment for you.

828
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,572
When can I see you?

829
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,373
MAN ON PHONE: Soon.

830
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,109
I promise.

831
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,176
You're the one I
want to be with.

832
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:03,346
I never want you to doubt that.

833
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,081
What about this weekend?

834
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:09,219
MAN ON PHONE: Jude,
you're pushing again.

835
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,654
It's not that easy.

836
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:12,455
All right, when will you know?

837
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,291
MAN ON PHONE: I'm
doing the best I can.

838
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,492
Work's a disaster.

839
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,527
Hank's breaking
my balls as usual.

840
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,496
Chloe's waiting to hear about
colleges, Joel's playing

841
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:20,864
hockey for two different teams.

842
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,232
I got a lot of
demand on my time,

843
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:25,402
not to mention you jeopardizing
everything by calling my house.

844
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,741
Look, I'll figure
something out, all right?

845
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,644
I promise.

846
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,647
You trust me, don't you?

847
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,049
Yeah.

848
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:40,483
Of course.

849
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,619
MAN ON PHONE: We both kinda knew
the deal when we got into this,

850
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:43,621
didn't we?

851
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,024
OK, I gotta go.

852
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,926
I'll call you tomorrow.

853
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:50,927
Bye.

854
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:51,929
Bye.

855
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:57,934
I was talking to Charlie
Manson the other day.

856
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,303
He says, is it hot in
here, or am I crazy?

857
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,949
(SINGING) Miss Tallie,
they say you are going.

858
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:18,455
We will miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile.

859
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:24,461
Oh, they say you are taking the
sunshine that has brightened

860
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:27,597
our path for a while.

861
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,599
Yeah!

862
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,478
Why do you give him
that chicory crap?

863
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,946
You know what Dr. Remcor said.

864
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:43,913
Yep.

865
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,875
I'll see you tonight
at your dad's.

866
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,434
All right, sweetheart.

867
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,691
Mommy's off.

868
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:55,693
I'll see you later?

869
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,631
Bye, guys.

870
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,174
(SINGING) And if we
go someplace to dance,

871
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:14,477
I know there's a chance you
won't be leaving with me.

872
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,819
And afterwards, we hop
into a tiny little boat,

873
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:24,587
and have a drink or two.

874
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,461
And then I go and spoil
it all by saying something

875
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:33,329
stupid, like I love you.

876
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,801
I love you.

877
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:46,276
I love you.

878
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,377
Come on, move!

879
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,390
[knocking]

880
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,326
[knocking]

881
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,597
TIM: It's Tim!

882
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,667
Can I come in?

883
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:11,468
I'm so...

884
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,569
It's your dad.

885
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:13,571
[screaming]

886
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,009
Yo, everybody
downstairs, chop chop.

887
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,144
You all right?

888
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,212
Gather round.

889
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,013
What's going on?

890
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,081
I have news.

891
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:25,882
What?

892
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,417
Alan called.

893
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:30,119
He says the top guys at
Jupiter heard the master

894
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,921
of "When I Live My Life."

895
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,223
They think it's gonna be big.

896
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,190
Huge.

897
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,758
They think it's
gonna be a huge hit.

898
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,759
What?
I didn't know.

899
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,627
It's his comeback.

900
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:38,428
You're fucking dead.

901
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,462
It's not a comeback.

902
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:42,298
I never went away.

903
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, they got mea gig.

904
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:49,939
Test run live, special guest for
an act called The Flaming Lips.

905
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,209
Wait... you're opening
for The Flaming Lips?

906
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,611
That is huge.

907
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:55,545
That's ridiculous.

908
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:56,513
Flaming Lips.

909
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,413
They're terrific.

910
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:58,481
I love them.

911
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,383
OK, for starters,
it's called The Flaming

912
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:02,919
Lips, not "The Flaming Lips."

913
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:03,753
The Flaming Lips.

914
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,088
Flaming Lips.

915
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,022
Flaming Lips.

916
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,825
Do you even know
this band at all?

917
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:09,726
No.

918
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,528
OK, let me fill you in.

919
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,631
The Flaming Lips, their
fans are not your fans.

920
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,299
Like, trust me... not at all.

921
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:17,867
If they're asking you
to open up for them,

922
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,537
they're doing it out of some
sort of ironic hipster goof.

923
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,499
Jude, beware the
green eyed monster.

924
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:36,686
I can't believe you actually
like living out here.

925
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,755
You know, it's not so bad.

926
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:42,725
It's been like, five years now.

927
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,427
You know, Corinne likes
to be near her dad,

928
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,896
and then we get the pool.

929
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,603
You don't miss the city?

930
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,905
Uh, yeah.

931
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,240
Hustle and bustle.

932
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,676
I miss that, but Corinne's
there, like, two days a week,

933
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:01,911
and then I can work
from home, so I get

934
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,012
to spend more time with David.

935
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:04,014
You know?

936
00:43:06,518 --> 00:43:09,886
It's probably just a phase.

937
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:10,887
David, I mean.

938
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:11,688
Yeah.

939
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,655
Yeah.

940
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:14,617
Just like, eight
years and counting.

941
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,598
You do a good job with him.

942
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,532
Mm-hm.

943
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,968
Seriously.

944
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,050
I've been watching you.

945
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,908
Good lord, it's
Lee Harvey Oswald.

946
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,875
Jude, come on.

947
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,177
Take a ride.

948
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,311
I'm busy.

949
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,179
Yeah, me too.

950
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:36,980
Come on.

951
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:37,982
I'll be dead soon.

952
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:49,759
You and Corinne, you doing good?

953
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,995
Same as it ever was.

954
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,396
Why?

955
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:56,032
You're not carrying a
torch for Tim still, right?

956
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:58,901
God, Paul.

957
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,336
That was, like, 100 years ago.

958
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,872
Give me a break.

959
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:05,608
Don't get me wrong, I
love Tim, but he's not

960
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,510
the sharpest Swiss army knife.

961
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:11,547
Well, that is Corinne's
problem, isn't it?

962
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,416
This song, it's such a classic.

963
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:15,451
It is bona fide classic.

964
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:19,355
You know, the term is
overused, but is a classic.

965
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:25,428
It takes me back to an amazing
weekend I spent in Acapulco

966
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,296
with a starlet who
shall remain nameless.

967
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:28,631
Can you please
save your stories

968
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,900
of your prehistoric conquests
for your geriatric friends

969
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,368
at the country club?

970
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,104
Besides, a fan's a friend.

971
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:38,207
I owe you a phone
call, you devil.

972
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,289
You realize that it's
Van Morrison, right?

973
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,281
You know, it's a shame
that you and this starlet

974
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:48,718
that shall remain nameless
didn't make a go of it.

975
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,987
Could have spared us your
marriage to the wicked witch

976
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,422
of the Upper West Side.

977
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,357
You could go easier on Lucille.

978
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,459
What have you got
against her, anyway?

979
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:58,327
Nothing.

980
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:01,531
I happen to know that you and
Corinne call her the devil.

981
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:02,899
Only affectionately.

982
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,901
You think she's a
gold digger, right?

983
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:06,302
Not a very good one, obviously.

984
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,510
Pull.

985
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,682
Stupid clay pigeons.

986
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:22,018
I know you think I'm
nagging, but I can't stand

987
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,553
to see potential go to waste.

988
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:24,420
You could be great.

989
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,556
Still could be really something.

990
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,224
You're gifted.

991
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,492
Whoa, be careful with that gun.

992
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:30,494
God.

993
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,931
There's nothing more
common than wasted talent,

994
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:36,265
said Thomas Aquinas.

995
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,768
I don't think Saint Thomas
Aquinas ever said that, but OK.

996
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,770
Pull.

997
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:45,141
Tick tock, Jude.

998
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,977
You know what I'm talking about.

999
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,446
You're pushing 30.

1000
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,647
31.

1001
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:52,649
Pull.

1002
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,819
Maybe I don't want
to be a singer.

1003
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,188
Maybe I don't want your life.

1004
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,958
I was thinking of becoming
a barista, actually.

1005
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,393
Somebody who pours seven
dollar cups of coffee,

1006
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,828
it's not a career.

1007
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,830
Pull.

1008
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:10,234
[gunshot]

1009
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:11,934
Stupid clay pigeon.

1010
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,170
Sir, are you sure this
thing is calibrated?

1011
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,809
I only want the best for you.

1012
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:21,210
Do you?

1013
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,646
You sure you're not just trying
to live vicariously through me?

1014
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,715
If I wanted to
live vicariously,

1015
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:26,877
it wouldn't be through you.

1016
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:30,387
Pull.

1017
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:38,194
You really are an asshole,
you know that, Paul?

1018
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,473
You know, I met
the Dalai Lama once,

1019
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,409
and I happened to be cooking
hot dogs at the time.

1020
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,212
I said, what do you want?

1021
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:59,782
And he said, make me
one with everything.

1022
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:05,688
[laughter] The Dalai Lama,
make me one with everything.

1023
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,689
Huh?

1024
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:07,824
I want to jump out of this car.

1025
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:08,925
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1026
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,126
I want to kill...

1027
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:13,462
Listen, I know how you
feel about the Dalai Lama.

1028
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:17,133
You know, to me he's just a guy.

1029
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,135
What does he know
about show business?

1030
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,502
[chatter on radio]

1031
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:20,997
Paul!

1032
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,965
Are you coming upstairs soon?

1033
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:23,967
In a minute.

1034
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:46,422
Hey.

1035
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,723
You busy?

1036
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,358
Seriously, Tim, I don't have
the brain space right now.

1037
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,893
No, no, no, no.
Come on, not like that.

1038
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,015
Let's just go for a ride.

1039
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,975
An open mic night?

1040
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:06,776
No way.

1041
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:07,576
No, no, no, no, no.

1042
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:08,811
It's not an open mic night.

1043
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:11,347
This is... this is, uh,
officially an intervention.

1044
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,349
I'm not a 15 year old
on YouTube, all right?

1045
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,150
I'm a professional.

1046
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,785
[clucking]

1047
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,723
Give me that.

1048
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:25,194
I'm doing this just to make
you stop making that noise.

1049
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,564
So, let's bring out our
next performer, Jules Lipton.

1050
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,105
Yes, uh, actually
that's Jude Lipman.

1051
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:37,107
June Litton.

1052
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:40,910
Whatever.

1053
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:46,115
Um, yeah, this is, uh... this
is a song that I, um, wrote.

1054
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,824
[music playing]

1055
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:09,805
(SINGING) Oh, this
heart is a foolish one.

1056
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,776
It's never worked right.

1057
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:19,248
So loudly it keeps me
awake in the night,

1058
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:25,221
and it forces me out of bed.

1059
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:28,724
Pacing my floor instead.

1060
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:34,697
Longing for things to
which it has no right,

1061
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:42,699
and no whiskey or wine can it
sway my poor, ludicrous heart.

1062
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:53,643
It just rattles the bars,
rattles the bars of its cage.

1063
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Oh, and sometimes it feels
like it must weigh 100 pounds.

1064
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:10,299
Sometimes it's light, so
much lighter than air.

1065
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:18,301
But always it wants too much,
needs too much, feels too much.

1066
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:24,713
Loves so much more than
just one heart can bear,

1067
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:32,715
and sometimes, in a hideous
rage, yeah, my ludicrous heart,

1068
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:43,193
it just rattles the
bars, rattles the bars,

1069
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:49,505
rattles the bars of its cage.

1070
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,941
[applause]

1071
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,226
Wow.

1072
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:12,461
It's a gorgeous night, huh?

1073
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,703
There's supposed to be a
lunar eclipse next week.

1074
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:23,305
I'm having an affair
with a married man.

1075
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,273
Oh, yeah?

1076
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:26,675
Who is he?

1077
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:29,845
Just some guy I met at the gym.

1078
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:34,383
He owns a bunch
of KFCs in Jersey.

1079
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:37,286
How old is he?

1080
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,754
I don't know.

1081
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,556
Why?

1082
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:41,557
I don't know.

1083
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,025
Just curious.

1084
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:44,026
I don't know.

1085
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:45,961
Like, 50?

1086
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,170
OK... all right, I lied.

1087
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:57,740
He doesn't own any KFCs.

1088
00:52:57,742 --> 00:52:59,708
He is my analyst.

1089
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:08,784
Well, I at least thought
that would get a reaction.

1090
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:12,888
I've been around this
family for too long.

1091
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,850
You know what I've
never understood?

1092
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:18,894
How the hell you
ended up with Corinne.

1093
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,196
Do you know what
I've never understood?

1094
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,431
Why do you hate her so much?

1095
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:25,834
I get that you guys are
different, and that's fine,

1096
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:27,903
but she's not a terrible person.

1097
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,538
I mean, seriously.

1098
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,342
She's completely kind, and fun.

1099
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:34,944
Fun?

1100
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,646
OK, I'll concede you kind before
I'm gonna concede you fun.

1101
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,215
And even kind is a stretch.

1102
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,382
She participates
in the community,

1103
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,717
she cares about the environment.

1104
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,785
And Hitler loved his dog.

1105
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,119
OK that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1106
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,921
I mean, I get that you
don't like Corinne,

1107
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,256
but then when you
compare her to Hitler,

1108
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,857
you're not really making
your case, you know?

1109
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,226
It was a joke.

1110
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,294
You're sounding hysterical,
and like, it's really awkward

1111
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,596
for me too, do you know?

1112
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:54,563
Do you ever consider that?

1113
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,299
It gets fucking old.

1114
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,435
I'm sorry.

1115
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:03,839
I am, I'm... I'm sorry
for you, but... Tim.

1116
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,984
This shit between me
and Corinne is old.

1117
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:14,116
Don't you have issues with her?

1118
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:15,884
I mean, come on, you must.

1119
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,186
Of course I do.

1120
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:22,091
But you don't get to choose
who you fall in love with.

1121
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,926
Sure you do.

1122
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,395
What you don't get to choose
is who loves you back.

1123
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:35,204
I mean, you think
if, um... if we'd

1124
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:37,573
stayed together all those
years ago, we'd have,

1125
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,074
uh... we would have worked?

1126
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,713
If we'd just tried
a little bit harder.

1127
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,849
If the timing had
been different.

1128
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,931
If we'd just been a
little bit more mature.

1129
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,389
If Corinne didn't come along?

1130
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:54,189
Yeah.

1131
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:54,990
No.

1132
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,158
Maybe.

1133
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,995
My aunt had a dick,
should be my uncle.

1134
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,299
Jude the vulgarian.

1135
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:04,421
Some things never change.

1136
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:21,817
What are you...
what are you doing?

1137
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,586
I, um... I...

1138
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:25,454
I...

1139
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:26,355
I'm...

1140
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,891
I'm married to your sister, OK?

1141
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,092
What's wrong with you?

1142
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:30,893
I'm sorry.

1143
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:32,027
I mean, you need some help.

1144
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:34,229
You need help, and
you need to not screw

1145
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,531
the help when you get the help.

1146
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:40,936
I'm sorry.

1147
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:42,004
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1148
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:42,805
Just...

1149
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:43,706
No, it was no big deal.

1150
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,573
It was no big deal.

1151
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:45,808
I overreacted.
That was...

1152
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,342
I gotta go.
Sorry.

1153
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,142
It was nothing.

1154
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:47,976
Please don't run away.

1155
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:49,178
Come on.

1156
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,180
Wait!

1157
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:47,302
Lourdes, you are the best.

1158
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:49,304
Good to my house.

1159
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:51,840
I shall return anon.

1160
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:54,343
I'm off to my [inaudible],
in case anybody cares.

1161
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:58,847
ALAN (OVER PHONE): OK.

1162
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:01,717
You are all set to meet Marty
Sedgwick tomorrow morning

1163
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,352
at 10:00 AM in the city.

1164
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:06,121
Who knows who you are, he
knows who your father is.

1165
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,623
Most importantly, he
knows you can sing,

1166
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:10,592
cause I sent him
some of your stuff.

1167
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:16,131
Now, listen to me... Marty is a
real gut feeling kind of guy,

1168
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,466
OK?

1169
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,968
He fancies himself to be a
very sharp judge of character.

1170
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,970
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Alan?

1171
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:26,975
I'm just saying, be
your good, old fashioned,

1172
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,211
charming, on time self.

1173
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:38,387
I feel bad about this.

1174
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:40,122
What are you, a martyr?

1175
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,124
All I did was put
my foot in the door.

1176
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,827
Nobody gets anywhere in
life without a little help

1177
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:46,261
every now and then.

1178
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:49,531
So you caught a bit of luck
being Paul Lombard's daughter.

1179
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:52,000
I don't need to tell you
that being close to that guy,

1180
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:56,004
it ain't necessarily
a game of Frisbee.

1181
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:58,707
So let's just call this
fair compensation, OK?

1182
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,981
Jude?

1183
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,383
Jude?

1184
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:09,852
Jude?

1185
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:10,854
Jude?

1186
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,240
Have a good round?

1187
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,178
What are you doing?

1188
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,045
I was going over there.

1189
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:40,249
I had to make a stop.

1190
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:44,786
God, you are completely
and utterly shameless.

1191
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:45,988
Your car is right here.

1192
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,489
Anyone could see you
were having an affair.

1193
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,625
What are you doing, driving
around, looking for my car?

1194
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:50,627
I had a meeting.

1195
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,697
Jesus, Paul, I should have
known something was up.

1196
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,299
All this golf in the winter.

1197
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:58,634
How could you do
this to Lucille?

1198
00:58:58,636 --> 00:58:59,868
You hate her.

1199
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,672
Is there a woman I know
that you haven't slept with?

1200
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:07,409
My... my friends, my teachers.

1201
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:08,411
Lourdes?

1202
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,415
You slept with Lourdes?

1203
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:14,283
A lifetime ago.

1204
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:15,384
Are you kidding me?

1205
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:17,419
Look, I'm not saying
the father of the year

1206
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:19,254
people misplaced my trophy.

1207
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:20,455
Unbelievable.

1208
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:23,425
Face it, this is about me
cheating on your mother.

1209
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,727
Of course it's about
you cheating on Mom!

1210
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,728
What do you blame me for?

1211
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,364
Bad parent, bad
husband, bad judgment.

1212
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:30,866
Check, check, check.

1213
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,868
It's the birthdays
that you missed,

1214
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,804
it's telling Mrs. Croom not
to cast me in the school play

1215
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,506
because I'd forget all my lines.

1216
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:40,876
It's the graduation you missed
because you were in rehab.

1217
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:42,110
I went to rehab for you guys.

1218
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:43,679
It is a comment you made
to the New York Times

1219
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,213
about talent not
running in the family.

1220
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:46,181
I'm not to blame for every...

1221
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,583
Thanks a lot for that...

1222
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:49,618
Bump you've had in your life,
much as you want to think so.

1223
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,954
That's great, Paul.

1224
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:56,725
Take no responsibility
for the way that you,

1225
00:59:56,727 --> 01:00:03,432
your life, that your
behavior has fucked me up.

1226
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,933
Didn't do that to Corinne.

1227
01:00:33,564 --> 01:00:36,965
What's the matter with her now?

1228
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,734
She's nuts.

1229
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:40,502
Pain in the ass.

1230
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:41,503
Where's Lucille?

1231
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,171
You know, maybe if
I acted that way,

1232
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:46,074
you'd spend this much
time and energy on me.

1233
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:47,643
Corinne, I don't
have time right

1234
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,444
now for two bat shit daughters.

1235
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,580
You're supposed to
be the stable one.

1236
01:00:51,582 --> 01:00:54,783
Do you know where Lucille is?

1237
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:57,152
She's getting a mani-pedi.

1238
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,153
Not here?

1239
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,956
Not here.

1240
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:01,958
OK.

1241
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:21,377
Don't tell Lucille.

1242
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,214
It'd destroy her.

1243
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:28,950
I'm not a snitch.

1244
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:31,687
If you want to keep living
your life like this,

1245
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,088
be my fucking guest.

1246
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:39,061
You have a finely tuned
sense of injustice, Jude,

1247
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:42,531
and that's good, but you
should get out of your sandbox

1248
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,699
once in a while.

1249
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,467
I'm not a villain.

1250
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,169
You don't see it.

1251
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,805
You don't see the
destruction that you cause.

1252
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:53,308
Or at least you pretend not
to, so you can sleep at night.

1253
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,320
You're like this
big, overgrown child,

1254
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:09,558
who just rampages through
life, doing whatever

1255
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,128
the fuck his heart desires.

1256
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,963
That's terrible.

1257
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:19,835
And I know it's standard new age
procedure to blame your parents

1258
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:24,306
for your troubles, and I take my
shame of blame for my problems,

1259
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,041
and yours too,
but you can't make

1260
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:28,610
me a stooge for
everything that makes

1261
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,513
you unhappy about yourself.

1262
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:34,416
You should thank me.

1263
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:35,951
Thank you?

1264
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:37,919
You're welcome.

1265
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,323
Thank you for what?

1266
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:46,394
For giving you a get
out of blame free card.

1267
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:48,430
No matter what you
do, you can shrug it

1268
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:51,333
off and blame it on me.

1269
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:54,369
You think I'm a child.

1270
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:55,371
Maybe.

1271
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:00,308
You're an adult, Jude.

1272
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,611
Why don't you grow up?

1273
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,613
Stop blaming everybody
for your mess.

1274
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:35,410
Hey.

1275
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:38,380
Did it hurt?

1276
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,382
What?

1277
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:44,452
When you fell out of Heaven.

1278
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:48,990
Not enough o's in smooth
for you, huh, buddy?

1279
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:52,160
I'm Josh.

1280
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,995
I'm Jude.

1281
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,198
Hey, Jude.

1282
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
That's clever.

1283
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,002
You a year rounder?

1284
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,571
I haven't seen you
in here before.

1285
01:04:02,573 --> 01:04:08,877
Yeah, I've been on a little
vacation from booze lately.

1286
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:12,881
It's good to be back.

1287
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:19,154
You know, I could give you a
whole line, turn on the charm,

1288
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,790
play the game, but I
don't want to do that.

1289
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:24,993
You look like a special lady.

1290
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,695
Somebody that I'd
like to get to know.

1291
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:27,762
So what do you say?

1292
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:29,764
I've got a better idea.

1293
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,733
How about you and me
pretend, just for a second,

1294
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:35,070
that we're not both
completely full of shit?

1295
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:35,871
OK.

1296
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,939
Sure.

1297
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:40,609
I get it.

1298
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:43,545
It's funny... you meet
so many people, who have

1299
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:47,515
these strategies that they use.

1300
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,517
Tricks, you know?

1301
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,552
Sometimes it's hard to know...

1302
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,520
That's all very
fascinating, Jake.

1303
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:53,455
Uh, it's Josh.

1304
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:54,856
That's all very
fascinating, Josh.

1305
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,858
Would you like to stay here and
keep working on your material,

1306
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,495
or would you rather go get
your brains fucked out?

1307
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,497
Brains out, please.

1308
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:11,206
[phone ringing]

1309
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,088
Hello?

1310
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,124
WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm trying
to reach Jude Lipman?

1311
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,492
Eh.

1312
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:32,060
WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm calling
form Marty Sedgwick's office.

1313
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:35,096
You had an appointment with
Marty at 10:00 this morning?

1314
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,298
Oh, fuck!

1315
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,766
WOMAN ON PHONE: Sorry?

1316
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:38,967
Marty's on a very
tight schedule.

1317
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,136
We weren't sure if you
got delayed, or something?

1318
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:43,705
Yeah, my... my car broke
down halfway into the city.

1319
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:45,440
I was-I was coming
from Long Island.

1320
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,609
Uh, the tow truck just
got here, actually,

1321
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,946
and it looks like I can be
there in, like, two hours.

1322
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,013
Is that OK?

1323
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:53,081
WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm
sorry, this morning

1324
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,083
was the only time Marty had.

1325
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:56,685
I was told this was
a special favor he

1326
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:57,887
was doing for Alan Sternberg?

1327
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:03,758
You could try having Mr.
Sternberg call again.

1328
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,559
No.

1329
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:08,029
Um... you know what?

1330
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:12,600
Um, that's OK.

1331
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:13,602
Never mind.

1332
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:15,897
Just do this.

1333
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:17,365
Just do it.

1334
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,801
Get it over with.

1335
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:22,637
You got yourself here,
you asked for it.

1336
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:28,076
Just do it.

1337
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:29,377
Get out of your own way.

1338
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,046
Just do it.

1339
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,247
Go right through it.

1340
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:33,715
You understand?

1341
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:37,619
It's a... it's a bit pricey.

1342
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:38,453
No, no, of course.

1343
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:39,254
Of course.

1344
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:40,055
You're right.

1345
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:41,623
What's up with you and Paul?

1346
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,291
What do you mean?

1347
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,426
What do I mean?

1348
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:46,561
There's this big cold
front between the two

1349
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,196
of you, is what I mean.

1350
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:51,566
Well, this'll shock you,
but we got in a fight.

1351
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,835
A big one.

1352
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:56,704
So that's why you're giving
him the silent treatment?

1353
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:57,539
Tonight?

1354
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,973
It's a big night for him, honey.

1355
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:01,055
He needs your support
on a night like this.

1356
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,881
I know.

1357
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,350
[humming]

1358
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:16,891
(SINGING) Over again.

1359
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:24,893
I live my life, oh...
[humming] All right.

1360
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:31,306
I'm not even gonna get
into the Marty Sedgwick blow

1361
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:32,874
off extravaganza.

1362
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,844
Put a lot of energy into
making that meeting happen.

1363
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:37,212
Pulled a lot of strings.

1364
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:38,113
The thanks I get.

1365
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:39,614
Oh, well.

1366
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,616
Thought we weren't
gonna get into it?

1367
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:50,024
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, the Suffolk Theatre

1368
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:52,494
and Electric Factory are
pleased to welcome, from deep

1369
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,963
in a [inaudible], the
pride of Ho-Ho-Kus,

1370
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,932
New Jersey, the king of
romance, please put your hands

1371
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:59,367
together for Mr. Paul Lombard!

1372
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:12,280
(SINGING) If I had been born
in Hindustan, I'd reincarnate

1373
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,948
like the Hindus can.

1374
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:14,916
Yeah, Pauly!

1375
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:18,219
I'll tell you,
sir, I've got a plan

1376
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:21,156
when I live my life over again.

1377
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,765
There she is.

1378
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:31,900
What's the verdict?

1379
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:36,204
Has the old guy still
got the juice, or what?

1380
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:37,772
You were great.

1381
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,174
Where's Lucille?

1382
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,441
I don't know.

1383
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:41,709
Where's the record people?
I thought they were here?

1384
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:42,644
They said so.

1385
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,279
They should see this.

1386
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,613
They'll hear
about it, I'm sure.

1387
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:47,081
I can't take a chance.

1388
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,216
I gotta play out more.

1389
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:50,051
I'm gonna get Alan to
book me some more shows.

1390
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:52,487
Maybe LA, you know...
you could make it there,

1391
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:55,456
you can make it anywhere.

1392
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:59,227
You, um... you sure
that's a good idea?

1393
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:00,795
Yes.

1394
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,163
I'm back.

1395
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:04,365
I'm due... bi doo, bi doo.

1396
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,166
OK.

1397
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:06,067
All right.

1398
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:09,737
Just... maybe take it slow.

1399
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:12,640
I've been doing
that for 25 years.

1400
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,908
You gotta strike.

1401
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,944
Did you talk to that
Flaming Lips guy?

1402
01:10:15,946 --> 01:10:17,145
Wayne Coil?

1403
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:20,415
It's Wayne Coyne, and
no, I did not talk to him.

1404
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:21,749
Why?

1405
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:24,319
Jude, when a window
opens, you gotta jump.

1406
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,687
You never want to do that.

1407
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,122
Jesus, Paul, do you really
want to talk about this now?

1408
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:28,923
Tonight?

1409
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:29,857
Again?

1410
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,059
You're scared.

1411
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:34,095
I don't know about what,
but you are, and it shows.

1412
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:35,797
You'd be better
and more successful

1413
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:38,266
if you'd cut the beebop and
just get out of your own way.

1414
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:39,067
Stop.

1415
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,134
Just get over it.

1416
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,202
God, Paul, stop.

1417
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,370
Just get over it.

1418
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:45,006
Say yes, cause
scared is good for...

1419
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,909
Paul, are you fucking stupid?

1420
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:52,247
The audience only liked you
today because you were kitsch.

1421
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,214
Don't you get that?

1422
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,949
You're a fucking dancing monkey.

1423
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:55,951
A joke.

1424
01:10:58,288 --> 01:11:01,522
That's why they liked you.

1425
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:02,524
I know that.

1426
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:07,328
You think I don't know that?

1427
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,330
So what?

1428
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,600
[phone ringing]

1429
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,035
RECORDING: You've
reached Lucille Lombard.

1430
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,436
I can't come to the
phone right now,

1431
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,804
but if you leave
a brief message,

1432
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:18,072
I'll get right back to you.

1433
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:19,941
PAUL: Lucille, you OK?

1434
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:23,011
The show was more
than I imagined.

1435
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:25,847
Really, I... I'm sorry
you weren't there, babe.

1436
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:26,814
That surprised me.

1437
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,283
They told me you weren't there.

1438
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:44,699
Lucille, you OK?

1439
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:45,600
Whoa!

1440
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:46,901
What?

1441
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:48,002
You shit!

1442
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,792
Now, focus here.

1443
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:47,028
He's showing 16.

1444
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:51,065
Common wisdom is you stick
at 16, you play it safe.

1445
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:53,368
What do we say about
playing it safe?

1446
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,002
That's for pussies?

1447
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,404
Exactamundo.

1448
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:59,741
So how's Dad holding
up since Lucille left?

1449
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:03,044
You know, ain't
exactly new form.

1450
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:04,178
Yeah.

1451
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,547
I have a feeling this
one's going to get ugly.

1452
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,348
It's like something...

1453
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,183
Out of Mamet?

1454
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:12,620
It's exactly like
something out of Mamet.

1455
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:13,654
Where was I?

1456
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,857
You were in London,
with Harry Nelson.

1457
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:17,892
Nilsson.

1458
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:21,996
OK, so I'm in London,
it's the '80s,

1459
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:25,199
I'm in this club... it's 5:00 AM.

1460
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:28,069
I'm with Cosmo, the
manager of The Clash.

1461
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:33,541
I was never a big punk person,
but Cosmo was the real deal.

1462
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:34,742
Big heart.

1463
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:38,346
And he had on this
fantastic shirt,

1464
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:42,150
and I said to him, Cosmo,
that shirt is fantastic.

1465
01:13:42,152 --> 01:13:42,984
And he said, you want it?

1466
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:44,318
Let's swap.

1467
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,022
So right there, he peels it
off, and he hands it to me.

1468
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:50,258
Now here, you
should double down.

1469
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:53,094
I taught you how to double down.

1470
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:54,729
I got the best of that swap.

1471
01:13:54,731 --> 01:13:57,532
It still fits.

1472
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:58,534
Now you do it.

1473
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:06,974
As anticipated, Lucille
filed the divorce papers

1474
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:07,875
this morning.

1475
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:10,945
But there's a little wrinkle.

1476
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,613
Lucille is claiming
that she wrote "When

1477
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,015
I Live My Life Over Again."

1478
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:15,483
Oh, that's absurd.

1479
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,318
No court's gonna buy that.

1480
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,287
It's not quite as open and
shut a case as you might think.

1481
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:21,756
It's not like Paul is known
for his songwriting abilities.

1482
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:25,193
Where does it say that
the two skills are related?

1483
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:28,563
Did anybody complain that Brando
didn't write his own lines?

1484
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:29,897
I know that, but,
you know, she's

1485
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:32,867
exploiting a... a vulnerability
in the public perception.

1486
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:35,236
Well, has Lucille
ever written a song?

1487
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:38,206
No, but she does happen
to be in possession

1488
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,308
of a very compelling piece
of physical evidence,

1489
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:44,045
which is the original
manuscript of the song,

1490
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:45,446
in her own handwriting.

1491
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:49,917
Yes, I was driving... I dictated
it to her while I was driving

1492
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,419
with both hands on the wheel.

1493
01:14:51,421 --> 01:14:52,753
Were there any
witnesses to that?

1494
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:53,554
Lucille.

1495
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:55,690
Well, you see the problem.

1496
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,091
I mean, can't you
threaten to, like,

1497
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,626
counter-sue her, or something?

1498
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:00,862
Of course I can, and I will.

1499
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:04,932
But she's girding for a
long, drawn out legal battle.

1500
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:07,401
She's going to drag your
reputation through the mud,

1501
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:10,004
call your integrity
into question, and PS,

1502
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,906
it's going to be
extremely expensive.

1503
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:15,910
She could be counting on the
fact that you're gonna settle.

1504
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:17,545
Settle how?

1505
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:20,915
By offering to share
songwriting credit with her.

1506
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:23,684
I'd rather stick
pins in my eyeballs.

1507
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,887
Well, there is another option.

1508
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,255
Don't release the song.

1509
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:28,656
I mean, give her all
the credit she wants,

1510
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:31,192
but, you know, she'll never
make a penny off of it,

1511
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,727
because no one
will ever hear it.

1512
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,028
Simple.

1513
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:37,865
It's actually not the
stupidest idea I ever heard.

1514
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,300
It's close.

1515
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,801
You know, you
just have to decide

1516
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:42,870
how badly you want to
beat her, and if you want

1517
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,373
to sacrifice your comeback.

1518
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,807
I have another idea.

1519
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:47,809
What?

1520
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:01,623
[knocking]

1521
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,358
You it busy?

1522
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,893
Oh, um...

1523
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:06,928
Good.

1524
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:07,862
About the other night...

1525
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:09,297
Look, Tim, seriously, I...

1526
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:11,532
Jude, we have to
talk about this.

1527
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,305
You weren't entirely
to blame for all that.

1528
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,376
And I know, you know,
one of the reasons

1529
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:26,113
you don't come out here
so often is because of me.

1530
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:28,883
Don't flatter yourself.

1531
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:29,885
Am I wrong?

1532
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:35,324
You know what?

1533
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:41,329
Hang on.

1534
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:44,465
I can't deny, you know,
it's fun playing what ifs,

1535
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:47,134
and, you know,
flirting with you.

1536
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,172
Fantasizing.

1537
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:53,307
I... I know I do it.

1538
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:54,309
I know it's wrong.

1539
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,082
Sorry.

1540
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:05,786
I'm... not used to being told
something's not my fault.

1541
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:09,023
Uh, you know, I said it
was not entirely your fault,

1542
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:10,758
so it's really
just not entirely...

1543
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,559
You know what?

1544
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:12,593
It's close enough.

1545
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:13,595
I'll take it.

1546
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:22,536
No.

1547
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:23,904
God, Tim.

1548
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:25,106
I'm sorry.

1549
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,040
I thought... I thought
that was what you wanted.

1550
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,041
No.
God.

1551
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:30,578
I mean... but... yes.

1552
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:35,149
Yeah, but you said it yourself.

1553
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,150
It's not right.

1554
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,218
All right.

1555
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,855
And you're just figuring
this out now, huh?

1556
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,590
Yeah.

1557
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:45,126
Kinda.

1558
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:46,288
I know it's fucked up, Tim.

1559
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,650
What do you want, Jude?

1560
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:18,492
A sparkling blanc
with citrus and ginger?

1561
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:19,494
Right here.

1562
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,432
And a decaf flat white.

1563
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,604
So, what is it
that's on your mind?

1564
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:32,907
Obviously everyone's very
upset about what's going on,

1565
01:18:32,909 --> 01:18:35,142
and one of the most
disturbing things

1566
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:37,978
is your claim that you
wrote "When I Live My Life."

1567
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,046
It's not a claim.

1568
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,448
It's a fact.

1569
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,383
Tell me how that happened.

1570
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,719
How you wrote the song.

1571
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:48,022
Well, your father and I
were driving down the road.

1572
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:50,024
And what road was that?

1573
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:51,792
95.

1574
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:55,429
And out of the blue, these
words just suddenly came to me.

1575
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:58,199
So the lyrics came
first, and then the music?

1576
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,468
Yes, the lyrics came first.

1577
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:03,738
So at dinner, when my father
said that he wrote the song

1578
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,174
and you just took dictation,
why did you back him up?

1579
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:08,776
Look, I was not
going to embarrass

1580
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:10,544
him in front of his family.

1581
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,914
You know how fragile the
male ego is, especially his.

1582
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,783
You know, Lucille, if you
would have acted this well

1583
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,051
when you were doing
it for a living,

1584
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:18,652
you might have had a career.

1585
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:19,954
Setting aside the
fact that we all

1586
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,856
know you couldn't
write a shopping list,

1587
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:25,893
let alone a hit song, this
Pinocchio tale of yours

1588
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:28,796
is the biggest load of shit
I've ever heard in my life.

1589
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:30,798
And a jury is going
to feel the same way.

1590
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,867
Yeah, well, we'll
see about that.

1591
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:36,537
What I am proposing is
an alternative to court.

1592
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:39,774
We're prepared to offer you a
very fair lump sum in exchange

1593
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:41,175
for making this all go away.

1594
01:19:41,177 --> 01:19:43,911
And what's your definition
of this very fair lump sum?

1595
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,781
Are you kidding with that?

1596
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,925
That is a joke.

1597
01:19:57,927 --> 01:19:59,593
That is what we're offering.

1598
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:01,762
And what if I refuse?

1599
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:03,464
Then we'll all put
on our Sunday best,

1600
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:05,099
and we'll go to court.

1601
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:07,034
Guess I'll see you there, then.

1602
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:09,837
I think I'm gonna
have the crepe.

1603
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,906
By the way, have
you seen this movie

1604
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:16,110
called "Beverly Hills Cock?"

1605
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:19,580
How about "Desperately
Sucking Susan?"

1606
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:22,216
I haven't seen them myself,
not being an aficionado

1607
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:25,152
of '80s porn, but the private
eye who found them for me

1608
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,114
says you gave quite
the performance.

1609
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:32,426
You didn't think we knew
about that part of your past,

1610
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:33,928
did you?

1611
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:37,097
And these aren't softcore
nudies we're talking about,

1612
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,034
particularly this film
called "Poonstruck."

1613
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,468
No, I was never in that.

1614
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,703
That is a fucking lie.

1615
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:44,672
But we'll say you were.

1616
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,407
We'll say lots of
things, and we'll

1617
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:48,209
leave it up to the
court of public opinion

1618
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:51,979
to sort it all out.

1619
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:53,180
Jesus Christ.

1620
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,850
What do you think this
is, "The Scarlet Letter?"

1621
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:59,486
OK, so I did some skin flicks
when I was a young actress.

1622
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:01,388
Big fucking deal.

1623
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,592
Your father hasn't been
a choir boy all his life.

1624
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:07,127
I'm sure there's
some dirty laundry

1625
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:08,462
that he wouldn't like aired.

1626
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:10,764
Yeah, it's a funny thing
about that, actually.

1627
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:15,402
Paul's history sort of
insulates him on that front.

1628
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:20,841
It's that, uh, ugly
double standard again.

1629
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:23,744
So what I'm here to ask you
is are you willing to pass up

1630
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:27,181
a guaranteed payday to spend
years in a long legal battle

1631
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:31,485
over the share of rights to a
song that may or may not even

1632
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,521
see the light of day, and
have your name dragged

1633
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,523
through the mud,
which I assure you Al

1634
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:39,560
and I will absolutely
make sure happens?

1635
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,462
Or do you want to
take what I'm offering

1636
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:43,430
and move on with your life?

1637
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,466
Don't be stupid, Lucille.

1638
01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:46,468

this is Jude Lipman.

What do you need, Jude?

01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,945
Why do I have to
need something?

1676
01:24:44,947 --> 01:24:48,682
I often ask myself that.

1677
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:49,950
Wait, where are you?

1678
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:51,919
I'm in your house.

1680
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:05,927
I wanted to, um, tell you,
you, um... you did a good job.

1681
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:10,405
With Lucifer.

1682
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:15,176
Thank you.

1683
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:20,227
I heard Tim took you
to an open mic night.

1684
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:24,252
Uh, yeah.

1685
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:29,957
It was nice.

1686
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:33,727
Yeah, Tim's a... a nice guy.

um, tell you something else.

Uh, Jude's moving
to California.

Mm.

1697
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:05,425
Yeah, I figured it was,
uh, about time for me

1698
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:08,195

01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:16,803
So, no offense, but is
this you leaving the nest,

01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:20,207
or just running away
from your problems?
