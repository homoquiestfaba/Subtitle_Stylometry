He seemed to understand
Jackie's allure.

I'll never forget the look

blood stains on Jackie's pink suit.

there's this guy behind me.

he gives me this big smile.

00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,878
But it amounts
to the same thing.

176
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,176
They both want me.

177
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,347
♪ Young and pretty
in Los Angeles ♪

178
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,283
♪ Young and pretty
in Los Angeles ♪

179
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,119
When do you guys think
you're gonna need me again?

180
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,521
I mean, I can come--
Let's see, Monday...

181
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,989
I can come Thursday.

182
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,597
Daniel doesn't kiss.

183
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,651
[laughing]

184
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,334
I felt like I was in
The Young and the Restless or some shit.

185
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,906
[Corey] We never used condoms
because we both tested negative.

186
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,038
I've been faithful.

187
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,276
I don't know why.

188
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,875
Fear, maybe.

189
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,444
You know, I think
he's had me followed.

190
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,456
You mean now?

191
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,152
No. Not now.

192
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,265
Some part of me probably
wants him to know.

193
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,668
You're not gonna tell
him about this, are you?

194
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,439
I want him to know
you kissed me.

195
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,500
I want him to know
you fucked me.

196
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,101
Daniel doesn't do that.

197
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,440
[laughfl

198
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,618
What do you guys do?

199
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,789
Look.
[snaps]

200
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,191
You're not gonna tell
him about this, right?

201
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,025
You're clean,
aren't you?

202
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,393
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

203
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,202
I'm clean.

204
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,865
I took a shower
this mornin'.

205
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,152
Carlos gave me crabs.

206
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,356
And I gave them to Daniel.

207
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,623
I gave Corey crabs.
Courtesy of that little spic Carlita.

208
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,425
I practically convinced myself
that I got them at the gym.

209
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,426
I gotta take a dump.

210
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:11,067
You can get them from sitting
on a bench where someone sat.

211
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,973
Or from a towel.

212
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,139
Well, we better make sure that
Carlos doesn't touch our towel.

213
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,275
He knew that I let Carlos use the pool
and asked if he used our towels.

214
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,721
Our pristine, oversize, white
Martha Stewart bath sheets.

215
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,816
That's probably
how you got it.

216
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,882
Not from the gym.

217
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,429
That little sp-- Mexican.

218
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,531
Corey, you're dripping.

219
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,762
- What?
- You're dripping.

220
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,600
You're getting water
all over the floor.

221
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,072
Jesus.

222
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,506
Is this his way of letting
me know he suspected?

223
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,914
We speak in riddles.

224
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,918
[panting]

225
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,268
I don't regret what happened
with Carlos. I needed to be kissed.

226
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,771
It was more than the fucking.

227
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,807
It was the taste of his mouth.

228
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,942
Daniel kisses me the way
he'd kiss your aunt.

229
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,037
And now,
with all the plastic surgery,

230
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,274
Daniel's face is off limits.
Too intimate.

231
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,680
Although he couldn't get enough
of my cock up his ass.

232
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,618
[Daniel] I deserve a good fuck
when I need it.

233
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,418
For what I pay him
to trim a few trees?

234
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,220
Probably a daddy thing.

235
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,921
Wanted to fuck his powerful
papa's white butt.

236
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,590
Actually, he seduced me.

237
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,531
[panting]

238
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,466
Don't you dare
come inside me. puto.

239
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:51,039
After five years, Corey's lily-white,
circumcised dick bores me.

240
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,840
He treats me like he treats
everyone else.

241
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,437
He belittles people.
It's his hobby.

242
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,984
Even though he works
on a TV show

243
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,020
that is completely
dependent on a gay audience,

244
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,453
he's in the closet.
It's so fucked!

245
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,888
I haven't been
entirely faithful.

246
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,989
There's this straight black kid
who works in the mailroom.

247
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:18,395
I let him plow me with his oversized, uncut
piece of darky meat.

248
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,437
Ohh! Ohh!

249
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,404
Don't shoot inside me,
Mandingo.

250
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,772
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

251
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,650
[Corey]
Gotta get out of this.

252
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,617
I have to end it.

253
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,245
What'd you say?

254
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,520
What did you say?

255
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,555
[shouting]
What did you say?!

256
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,820
Did you say somethin'?

257
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,692
No. Let me get you a towel.

258
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:54,827
Thanks.

259
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,112
[Corey] When we first got together,
I thought maybe he'd change.

260
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,912
Okay, gimme a kiss.
Here we go.

261
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,247
Okay. Okay.

262
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:09,718
- Wait, you ready? Okay.
- You ready?

263
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,016
- Wait, you ready? Okay.
- You ready?

264
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,420
One, Two, Three.

265
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,288
Ow! That was my--
[laughs]

266
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,985
You hit my ball.

267
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,297
You look like you're
doin' the limbo.

268
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,198
Wait, wait, wait.
One, two, three.

269
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,998
[laughing]

270
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,800
Wait, you're gonna
drop the camera.

271
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,636
I managed to avoid it
all these years

272
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,574
while everyone around me
was droppin' dead.

273
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,477
I'm more powerful than
some faggot-killing virus.

274
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,640
Power runs in the family.

275
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,980
I inherited my power
from the senator!

276
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,955
Pow! Daddy. Pow! Big Daddy.
Pow! Pow! Power!

277
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,525
Fuck!

278
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,525
Fuck!

279
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,527
That fuck!

280
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,096
A few years ago,
my dad had this, um,

281
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,338
little public relations
challenge.

282
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,010
[panting]

283
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,513
He has this notorious
reputation as a racist.

284
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,882
So the irony was not
lost on anyone

285
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,647
when it came out in the tabloids

286
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,178
he'd made several visits
to a whorehouse full of nigger broads.

287
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,519
[chuckles]

288
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,058
Press had afield day.

289
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:29,057
While my mom remained as faithful
as a country western song.

290
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,642
Of course, the activists
went wild.

291
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,913
Not only was it a confirmation
of his racism,

292
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,888
they said he was proving
his disrespect for women.

293
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,356
Fuck 'em!

294
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,257
Still in office, baby.
Five years later.

295
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,920
[exhales]

296
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,565
I actually think some people
admired him for it.

297
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,160
He's 67 fuckin' years old.

298
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,603
And out porking
some black pussy.

299
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,933
More power to him.

300
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,048
[panting]

301
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,551
[slapping]
Ohh...

302
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,745
Come on.

303
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:23,980
Ohh!

304
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,390
Come on.
What am I?

305
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,620
Hey, come on.
What am I?

306
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,684
- Faggot.
- Come on, what am I?

307
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,026
- F...F...Faggot!
- Come on!

308
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,001

[breathing heavily]

312
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,802
[breathing slows down]

313
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,014
[breathing of both slows]

00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,741
Ohh!

[laughfl

321
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,640
After that whole situation...

322
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,233
my dad had a very serious
talk with me.

323
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,715
Without spelling it out, he made it
clear he knew I was a cocksucker.

324
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,784
Doesn't matter where
you stick it, son.

325
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,119
Just don't get caught
like your horny old man.

326
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:38,124
Daddy's right.
I gotta be careful.

327
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,862
We cannot lose our power.

328
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,500
Our power lies in lies.

329
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,386
No need to be openly anything.

330
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,985
You want toast?

331
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,548
[Daniel]
No, thanks.

332
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,518
We are kickin'
their overrated asses.

333
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,118
Who?

334
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,021
The show opposite us.
We the People.

335
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,185
Some liberal bullshit
from whafs-his-name.

336
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,194
[chuckles]

337
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,963
He is so full of himself.

338
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,467
I wouldn't know.
I've never seen it.

339
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,162
<i>I</i> watch that stuff.

340
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,569
Well, if you'd take
the parental controls off the TV,

341
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,470
I could make
my own decision.

342
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,339
Aw, you sweet, innocent fag.

343
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,278
It's for your own good.

344
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,909
Didn't they get
nominated for an Emmy?

345
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:07,950
Mmm.

346
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,210
I'd rather
have the ratings.

347
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,890
<i>Are you 910N191?</i>

348
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,393
Hmm?

349
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,691
To the Emmys?

350
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,062
Yeah.

351

00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:10,183
So, he died in 1996,
and so, after he died, I--

702
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,652
I started having lots of sex

703
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,556
with, uh, with lots of people.

704
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,153
And...crystal and sex, and...

705
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,331
I don't know.
Maybe I felt

706
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:28,302
like I had been depriving
myself all those years.

707
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:34,274
Maybe I was angry. That does--
that's what my grief counselor said,

708
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:38,044
that my-- my gluttonous sexual
appetite was anger-based.

709
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,180
Angry that Gerald died.

710
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,414
[snickers] No shit.

711
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,415
Yeah, no, I know.

712
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,509
No cross talk.

713
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:50,422
I replaced sex and crystal
with...with this.

714
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:56,194
I'm not getting very many
party invitations. [laughs]

715
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:03,305
I actually believed that
the best part of my <i>life</i> was over

716
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,603
and I was just marking time
until I died.

717
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:09,371
I was in New York
when I met Simon...

718
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,435
standing in line at the
Sullivan Street Playhouse

719
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,642
to buy tickets
to seeThe Fantasticks.

720
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,117
[Simon] So, how long
have you lived in New York?

721
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,619
I don't live here, actually.
I'm just visiting.

722
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,954
Los Angeles?

723
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:24,221
- Yeah. How'd you know that?
- [laughs]

724
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,954
Your accent.

725
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,561
My accent? Really?

726
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,162
I'm just kidding.

727
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,132
Maybe because you're wearing all those
layers and it's 53 degrees.

728
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,901
Well, it's cold.
Isn't it? Aren't you cold?

729
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,303
[laughs]
Oh, yeah. Wimp.

730
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,173
So, had you seen
this cast?

731
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,643
No, that was
my first time.

732
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:47,681
Your first time
seeing this play?

733
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,015
Yeah.

734
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,317
Ever?

735
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,411
Yeah. Why?

736
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,956
Well, it's, you know,
just that I've seen it

737
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,491
once a year
for the last 20 years,

738
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:02,691
so it's kind of strange to be flirting
with an absolute virgin.

739
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,432
Oh, so you call
this flirting, huh?

740
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,201
Maybe it was because
I was out of town.

741
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,932
Maybe that's
why I let him in.

742
00:52:09,994 --> 00:52:11,200
Maybe it wasThe Fantasticks.

743
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:13,871
Have you seen it?

744
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,837
When something especially dramatic
happens during the show,

745
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,348
they throw these little
rainbow-colored tissues into the air.

746
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:22,851
It's so...

747
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:25,546
It's so...

748
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,922
[chuckles]

749
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:32,257
Cloying. But it's--
it's sweet.

750
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,822
Our bodies fit
inside each other.

751
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,867
All this pent-up emotion was
flowing out of me and into him.

752
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:44,037
It was...it was...fantastic.

753
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,005
Oh, God.

754
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,841
[laughfl

755
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,143
I can't believe
I just said that.

756
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,578
[laughfl

757
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,273
"Fantastic."

758
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,384
And then I was on a plane...

759
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:01,218
coming back to the west coast,
and what did I even know about him?

760
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,759
Monday at work
was just a blur.

761
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:08,957
<i>I--I came home early, wondering
who would make that first phone call.</i>

762
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,262
Oh.

763
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,931
<i>- [beep]
- [Woman] Message one.</i>

764
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,663
<i>Hey. It's Simon.</i>

765
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,740
<i>Um...
[laughs]</i>

766
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:30,676
<i>I think I'm in love.</i>

767
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,443
I called his number...

768
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,518
hundreds of times...

769
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,954
in the next few days.

770
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:44,758
I knew none of his friends
or relatives.

771
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:49,295
On Friday, I received an envelope
in the mail postmarked September 11th.

772
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,397
There was no letter inside.

773
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:57,235
Only seven of those...
square-shaped tissues from the play.

774
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,510
Even though I knew,
I kept dialing his number...

775
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:07,107
listened to his message...
just hoping.

776
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,317
At the end of September,
a woman answered the phone.

777
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,353
I didn't know what to say.

778
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:16,089
I hung up. It must have
been a relative.

779
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:19,151
The following day,
the phone was disconnected.

780
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,030
Disconnected.

781
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,534
Do you know that I thought about
going back to New York?

782
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,265
<i>To see The Fantasticks.</i>

783
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,006
You know.
But I was watchin' TV,

784
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,876
and they said- they said
that the play closed.

785
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:39,910
Fuck.

786
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,585
The fuckin' play died.

787
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,821
I just want to get high.

788
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,487
And forget.

789
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,399
Forget about him.

790
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:07,423
[electronica]

791
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,895
[panting]
[grunting]

792
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,538
[panting] Yeah.

793
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,512
What?

794
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,448
What's wrong?

795
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,383
Well, we don't
have to talk.

796
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:57,455
[water running]

797
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,633
Bighs]

798
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,159
Come on, this is silly.
Let me in.

799
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,736
No! I mean it.

800
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,173
Damn, Lisa.

801
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,309
You are so superstitious.

802
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,937
I can't believe you
of all people

803
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,878
would even be trippin'
over somethin' like this.

804
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,584
What?

805
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,398
So, it's...

806
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,494
You sure?

807
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,307
I can-- I can take it again.

808
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,848
And then l'll--
I'll make an appointment--

809
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,941
This is the happiest
day of my life.

810
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,315
[whispering]
You mean it?

811
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,323
Oh.
Mmm...

812
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:40,795
Ohh...

813
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,894
Please tell me
you want this.

814
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:12,654
I spent my entire life rejecting
the idea of even having a family...

815
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:17,665
being a wife, a mother.
Career always, always came first.

816
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,892
[Man]
What's your name?

817
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,164
James.

818
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,167
That's my name.

819
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,642
Um...

820
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,181
I'm a...yeah.
I'm a--

821
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,166
My name is Ralph.

822
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,261
Ralph Watson.

823
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,336
Junior.

824
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,107
That "Junior" was
a constant threat.

825
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,643
A challenge to live up
to my father's accomplishments.

826
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,013
What he did is
a triumph of mendacity.

827
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:09,711
My daddy learned
this white-washing trick from his daddy,

828
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,879
who was able to convince
the military that he was white.

829
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,021
He did not want
to be put in non-combat duty

830
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:17,116
because of segregation rules.

831
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,160
He loved America.

832
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,427
Even though America
didn't love him back.

833
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,762
[Lisa] I didn't grow up
in a household

834
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,264
that taught me
what I could be.

835
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,234
I grew up in a household
that taught me what not to be.

836
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:31,737
My mother...
[snickers] man.

837
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:35,868
You know, even though my father
was a blatant womanizer,

838
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:38,071
she chose
to look the other way

839
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,513
while she painted
the bathroom umpteen times.

840
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:44,314
And I'll never forget this:
my best friend's mother

841
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,385
finally divorced
her no-good husband

842
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,588
so that she can
venture out in the world

843
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:50,756
and find herself a career

844
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,454
for the first time,
after raising a family.

845
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,963
Now. my mother...
[snickers]

846
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,263
Nothing makes my mother
happier

847
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,803
than to cook and to clean
and to stay at home,

848
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,206
all while
standing by her man.

849
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,536
Hmm.

850
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,745
My father's motives
were not so honorable.

851
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,680
He chose real estate.

852
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,816
Selling houses
behind white picket fences

853
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,885
in white neighborhoods
to white people,

854
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:21,082
letting them think he was white.

855
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:27,151
He considered my beautiful
black mother a liability.

856
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,962
[Lisa] My mother would always say
that the only true happiness

857
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:34,025
in life is to find
somebody who loves you.

858
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,028
Now, I don't necessarily
disagree with that.

859
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,705
But, uh, apparently,
my mother also believed

860
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,941
that men were supposed
to cheat on their wives.

861
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:45,003
'Cause as long as my father
showed up for birthdays

862
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:47,580
and holidays
and family reunions,

863
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:51,780
smilin', grinnin', puttin' his arms around
folks and posin' for photos,

864
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,586
all was forgiven.

865
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,147
That always confused me, too.

866
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,825
Then I'd watch my mother
sit at the kitchen table late at night

867
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:04,297
just compulsively pasting
those same photos into photo albums...

868
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,699
documenting our so-called
happy family.

869
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,102
By the time I was a teenager,
I hated him.

870
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:12,104
Not only would I be proud
of my blackness,

871
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,073
not only
would I own my heritage,

872
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,543
I would be vocal about it.
Yet, I knew there was one thing

873
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,513
that would prevent me from
being a positive role model,

874
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:23,245
a black man who would be
admired and respected.

875
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,255
I was a black man
who liked men.

876
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,623
This was
simply unacceptable.

877
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:37,930
I felt such a disdain
and lack of respect for both of them.

878
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,632
Borderline hatred.

879
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:43,569
And l-- I couldn't wait to graduate
high school and get out of that house...

880
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,666
and justmpursue a life that
in no way resembled theirs.

881
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,143
And you know what? I did.
I did. I succeeded.

882
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,613
I put myself through college.

883
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:57,550
I zoomed to the top
of my field in advertising.

884
01:02:57,574 --> 01:03:01,954
I bought myself a townhouse
on Central Park West.

885
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:04,624
I had an interior decorator.

886
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,889
I had a housekeeper, full-time.

887
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,229
And I had a personal stylist.

888
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,099
And I dated up a storm.

889
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:18,170
Mostly white men, and, uh,
some of them famous.

890
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,673
And all of them rich.

891
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,808
Why don't you just leave
those for a minute? Just leave 'em.

892
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,378
- I have to put 'em in water.
- I know. lt-- It can wait. I--

893
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,813
- Just sit down for a second, would you?
- What's goin' on?

894
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:31,317
Nothin'. Nothin'.
I just wanna look at you sittin' down.

895
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,685
[laughs] You want to look
at me sittin' down.

896
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,521
Why do you want
to look at me sitting down?

897
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,752
You look so tall now,
and I just wanted to...

898
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,558
I love you.

899
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:51,404
And I'm just wondering if...
you've given any thought

900
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:55,274
to whether you would
marry me or not...

901
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,777
and be my wife.

902
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,815
Oh, my God.

903
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,346
I got married.

904
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,013
We're gonna have a kid.

905
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:12,525
A wife and a family
is the solution.

906
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:39,617
By the time I hit
my thirties,

907
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:41,987
I realized
that something was missing.

908
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,548
And there was such
a hole inside me.

909
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,426
And I didn't understand,
with everything that I had,

910
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,695
how could I let myself
get so empty?

911
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,097
And on top of that,
time was just racing.

912
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,499
It was just racing, and I
couldn't even catch up to it.

913
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:00,868
So I just...l don't know,

914
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:04,642
I just had to stop and slow
down and look at my life.

915
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:10,076
And, um, I looked at what
I came home to every night,

916
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:15,582
and I realized,
I came home to no one.

917
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,783
And that's when
I knew in my heart

918
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,918
that I really wanted
to be a mother.

919
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,961
[grunting]

920
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,471
Uhh! Ahh!

921
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,006
Ahh!

922
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,341
Ahh!

923
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:36,673
Ohhh...
Uhh!

924
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:39,145
Ahh!

925
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:40,876
Ahhhh...

926
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:41,981
[softly]
Ahh...

927
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,709
Ohhh...

928
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:44,911
Ohhh...

929
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:46,282
Ohhh...

930
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,353
Mmm...

931
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,354
Ohhh...

932
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,549
[whispers] Ohhh...

933
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,716
Ohhh...

934
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,885
[Lisa] You know, I know
this sounds like a cliché,

935
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,453
but, um, time really

936
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,362
does move so fast.

937
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,560
And life really is short.

938
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,933
And every time
I feel this baby kick,

939
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:10,033
I think about how amazing
it is, how far I've come.

940
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,770
And I realize I still
have far to go

941
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:12,869
because, um...

942
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:17,348
I struggle with my feelings.

943
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,318
Like right now.

944
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:23,290
Ralph was supposed to be home from the
furniture store about a half hour ago.

945
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,256
And so I worry.

946
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,125
And when I worry, I inevitably
think about my father

947
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:30,857
and...all my feelings
about him,

948
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,592
because he was always
late for everything,

949
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,228
and there were certain nights
he didn't even show up at all.

950
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:41,437
But then I feel the baby
kick inside me again, and--

951
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:46,847
Oh, my God, do you see that?

952
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:47,881
[haPPih/l
Oh.

953
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,345
[laughs softly]

954
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,688
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

955
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,222
Oh...

956
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,830
Oh, my God.

957
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,234
[laughfl

958
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,094
Oh, my God.

959
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,937
Oh, yes.

960
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,671
Come on, you.

961
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,502
Come on.

962
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,674
Ohhh...

963
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:29,321
You know, Ralph...
Ralph can't even believe

964
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:32,723
I insisted on painting
this entire room myself.

965
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:35,659
He's not even crazy
about the color.

966
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,527
You know what? I like it.

967
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,362
It's a bright, sunny yellow.

968
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:44,067
And my mother's favorite
color is yellow.

969
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,336
So there.

970
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:47,968
Come on, Boo.

971
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,046
[grunts softly]

972
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:55,873

Hello.

Hi. ls Ralph there?

979
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,323
No, I'm sorry, he's not in right
now. May I take a message?

980
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,698
Oh, well, he'll probably
be home any minute.

981
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,168
He said he was comin'
straight home.

982
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,364
He left his wallet.
Are you--

983
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,500
Yeah, I'm his wife, Lisa.
Who is this?

984
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,835
Well, honey, if you're
his wife, I'm Jackie O.

985
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,571
Excuse me?

986
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,116
Who is this?

987
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:35,221
It's Ronnie.
Are you... really his wife?

988
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,285
Yes, I am. Where did he leave his wallet
that you would have it?

989
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:44,521
Uh...

990
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,399
