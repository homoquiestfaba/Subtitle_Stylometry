1
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,042
You ready?

2
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:58,545
Yes.

3
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,416
Then get in.

4
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,525
This is Melissa.

5
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,960
Hi.

6
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,164
Hello.

7
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:54,133
So you're going to be
working with Miss Ricard?

8
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,467
That's right.

9
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,570
That's cool.

10
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:59,972
You'll probably be doing
most of the driving now.

11
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:02,375
Miss Ricard doesn't drive.

12
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:03,542
Okay.

13
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,181
Can you handle a gun?
You'll need that.

14
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,382
You'll need a gun.

15
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:12,217
Yes.

16
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,087
I worked security
for a few years.

17
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:16,021
That's just great!

18
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,025
That's great.

19
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:24,030
You can stay in the office
until you find a place.

20
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,432
Thank you.

21
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,700
Here's the box you
had me pick up for you.

22
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,003
Thank you.

23
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:05,138
What's in there?

24
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,640
I didn't look or anything.

25
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:09,675
I was just wondering.

26
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,311
They're just old memories.

27
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,580
Okay!

28
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:16,215
Well, I'll leave you to it.

29
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:19,585
If you need Miss Ricard you
just press that little button

30
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:22,255
there on your desk.

31
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,056
Thank you.

32
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,111
Can I help you?

33
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,578
I'm here to see Rose Ricard.

34
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,713
Do you have an appointment?

35
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:55,715
No.

36
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:57,584
One moment.

37
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,691
I need to see Rose Ricard.

38
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:05,859
I'm Grant. How can I help?

39
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,227
I need to see Rose...

40
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:30,550
How are you feeling?

41
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,755
I'm so sorry.

42
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,893
I just, I haven't eaten in days.

43
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,597
Would you like Melissa
to call you an ambulance?

44
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,198
No, no.

45
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,167
I'll be fine.

46
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,840
How can I help you?

47
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,710
I need to see Rose Ricard.

48
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:00,246
I'm sure I can help you.

49
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:12,258
Detective Rigers told me
she was a special consultant

50
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,960
with the sheriff's department.

51
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:18,264
He says that Rose has a gift.

52
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,970
My husband has been
missing for three months.

53
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,838
Who is your husband?

54
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,207
Daniel Landers.

55
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,309
The boxer?

56
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,344
Yes.

57
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,681
Police closed that case.

58
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,749
No, unresolved.

59
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:40,353
What makes you believe
your husband is still alive?

60
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:45,191
Because of this.

61
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,360
Was is it?

62
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,931
It's an inventory
list of all the items

63
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:54,867
he kept in a safe deposit box.

64
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,703
I checked that box three
days ago and there was a gold

65
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:01,440
necklace in it that
wasn't there before.

66
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,843
And what did the police day?

67
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,777
Police won't help.

68
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,913
They said it wasn't enough
evidence to reopen the case

69
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:10,282
but I know it was him.

70
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:15,455
I just know Rose could
find him, I know she could!

71
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:18,992
If your husband is alive
and what you say is true,

72
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:23,263
it means he didn't
wanna be found or,

73
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:26,766
the locker was always there
and your husband is dead.

74
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,602
Dead or alive,

75
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,738
I want to know.

76
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,275
I need to know.

77
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:38,010
I understand.

78
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,596
Hello.

79
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm Rose Ricard.

80
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,909
Something's wrong.

81
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:47,846
Miss Ricard?

82
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,749
Can you please
come to the front?

83
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:06,865
Hey, Rose.

84
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:08,400
Stay there.

85
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,736
You're going to need that gun.

86
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,879
Please don't!

87
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:26,619
Please don't!

88
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,422
I asked for the bitch!

89
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:30,757
Not you!

90
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,158
Let's just calm down, sir.

91
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,160
Don't tell me to calm down.

92
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,828
Where is she?

93
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,866
She's not here.

94
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,435
Then go get her!

95
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,911
Ruined my life.

96
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:55,415
She ruined my life,
man. I was a teacher.

97
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:57,048
I used to help people.

98
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,117
He was raping and torturing
women in his basement!

99
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:00,486
Shut up!

100
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:03,523
You don't know that.

101
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,624
Neither does she.

102
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:09,928
Now, I got the cops after
me and I can't go home.

103
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,864
You don't really wanna
hurt anyone, brother.

104
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:14,934
Stop telling me
what I'm gonna do!

105
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,972
And go get her.

106
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:22,841
Look, I tell you what...

107
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,710
how about you just
walk out of here

108
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,747
and pretend this never happened?

109
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:28,648
All right?

110
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,016
Come on, man!

111
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,751
You and I know that ain't
gonna happen today, so stop!

112
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,787
No, it can. It can.

113
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:38,124
I'm putting my gun down.

114
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,095
All right? We can
make this work.

115
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:47,167
Mr. Shevers...

116
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:59,446
Come here, come here, come here.

117
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:08,086
Call 911.

118
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:24,604
Rose.

119
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:26,506
Detective Rigers

120
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:27,907
Self defense again?

121
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,109
Yes, he was going to kill me.

122
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,144
Your weapon came back clean.

123
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:35,280
Of course it did.

124
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:38,051
Can I speak to you for a second?

125
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,889
What do you really
know about this guy?

126
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:46,157
I know enough.

127
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:49,528
I suppose that's better
than knowing too much?

128
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,132
You be careful.

129
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,268
I always am.

130
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,092
So what do you think?

131
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,595
About what?

132
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:25,632
Abagail. Her case.

133
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:29,167
What should we do?

134
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,303
We should help her.

135
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,739
And the guy with the gun?

136
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,609
You don't think we
should talk about that?

137
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:38,945
What do you want me to say?

138
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:42,848
I wanna know what you're
thinkin'. What you feel.

139
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,851
It doesn't matter what I feel.

140
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:49,654
My mother used to say,

141
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,792
"Feelings are like
a thousand sun rises.

142
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:56,296
"All different, ever-changing."

143
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,799
Soon I'll feel
something different.

144
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,168
But that man was shaken.

145
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,205
He was a rapist.

146
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:09,208
And now he'll never
hurt anyone else.

147
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:15,914
Have you ever thought,
what if you...

148
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:18,884
-What if I'm wrong?
-Yes.

149
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:24,289
I used to, when I was young.

150
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:28,927
Eventually you
accept what it is.

151
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,163
You know what you
shouldn't know.

152
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:35,667
You see what you
shouldn't be able to see.

153
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,238
Do you ever wish
you didn't have it?

154
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:44,844
Who am I to decide
God's will for my life?

155
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:50,082
I just want to be sure I'm
living well inside of him.

156
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,859
Rose, come here.

157
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:09,167
Mrs. Bordeaux called
from the school today.

158
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,804
You know why?

159
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,205
Yes.

160
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:17,042
You cannot speak to
your teacher that way.

161
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,845
Daddy, she accused me of
cheating and I didn't do that.

162
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:21,781
And?

163
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:25,250
And, so I told her what I saw.

164
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:26,918
Her sin was great.
She's an alcoholic.

165
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:30,823
It is not your place
to speak of such things.

166
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,060
I want you to refrain
from using your gift

167
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:37,962
unless I instruct you to.

168
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:41,833
Daddy, God did not give
me this gift to hide it.

169
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,170
Neither do men light a candle
and put it under a bushel,

170
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:46,272
but on a candlestick
and it giveth light

171
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,006
unto all that are in the house.

172
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,277
Your gift is there to help
save people, not condemn them.

173
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,846
Judge not, lest ye be judged.

174
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:56,081
Do ye not know that the
saint shall judge the world?

175
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:57,483
And if the world is
to be judged by you,

176
00:17:57,515 --> 00:17:59,819
are ye unworthy to judge
the smallest matters?

177
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,021
First Corinthians, 6:2.

178
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,357
You have not wisdom,
nor knowledge!

179
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,460
My people are destroyed
because of lack of knowledge!

180
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:10,361
But he that is spiritual
judgeth all things,

181
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:12,498
yet he himself is
judged of no man.

182
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,867
First Corinthians, 2:15.

183
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:18,070
When pride comes,
then comes disgrace!

184
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:21,340
But humility comes
wisdom, Proverbs 11:2.

185
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,075
The eyes of the arrogant
man should be humbled

186
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,945
and the pride of
men brought bow!

187
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:29,814
Isaiah, 2:11. The pride
of your heart deceives you!

188
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:32,818
Proverbs 28:26, He that
trusteth in his own heart

189
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,419
is a fool but he who walketh...

190
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,222
Enough!

191
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:37,822
You will learn that all
that is revealed to you

192
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,759
is not meant to be spoken.

193
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,860
Don't you test me again!

194
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:43,996
Now go to your room.

195
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,340
Rose.

196
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,943
Rose.

197
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,645
Yes?

198
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:05,318
Never mind.

199
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,278
Good afternoon.

200
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,314
-Good afternoon.
-I'm Rose Ricard.

201
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:11,450
This is my associate
Grant Summit.

202
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,118
Mrs. Landers is expecting us?

203
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,287
Please come in.

204
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,455
Thank you.

205
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:26,398
This way, please.

206
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,373
Thank you, Matty.

207
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,009
You're welcome.

208
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:40,546
Hello, Mrs. Landers.

209
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,415
-Mrs. Landers.
-Miss Ricard.

210
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:47,319
We decided to help you. We
just have a few questions.

211
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,287
Okay.

212
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:52,390
Where was your
husband last seen?

213
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:54,460
Let me show you.

214
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:56,329
Please.

215
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,500
This way.

216
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:14,347
It was here.

217
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:19,918
He was on a business
call and I went upstairs

218
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:22,421
so I wouldn't disturb him.

219
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:25,323
When I came back
down, he was gone.

220
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:28,927
His car was still in the
garage, his keys and wallet

221
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,631
on the dresser
where he left them.

222
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:43,208
There's so much sadness here.

223
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:47,111
I miss him so much.

224
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:49,282
I know you do.

225
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,351
There were allegations
of affairs before

226
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,387
and during your marriage.

227
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,055
Yes, well,

228
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,390
I guess I just
chose to ignore them.

229
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,594
I know my husband loves me.

230
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:05,297
But you didn't ignore them.

231
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,134
You're very angry
at your husband.

232
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:12,071
I was.

233
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:15,139
I was very angry.

234
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:18,042
But that doesn't mean
I didn't love him.

235
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:20,112
And your husband
hasn't made any contact

236
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:22,114
with you at all?

237
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:23,615
No.

238
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:26,452
All of his credit
cards and bank accounts

239
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:30,321
are still active,
haven't been touched since

240
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:31,657
he disappeared.

241
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:36,527
I don't meant to sound ignorant,

242
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,664
but how does it work?

243
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:40,465
How does what work?

244
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:42,667
It's a gift.

245
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,537
All spirit-filled
believers have discernment,

246
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,741
mines is just more
acute than most.

247
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:53,145
I went to psychics.
Soothsayers, voodoo priests.

248
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:55,580
No one was able to help me.

249
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:58,583
There's a spirit
world all around us.

250
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:01,286
Even now I hear them whispering

251
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,791
but it's not the vile utterings
of demons that I lean on.

252
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:10,329
It is the spirit of truth
who reveals all things.

253
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,032
Can you help me?

254
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:15,266
We will do our best.

255
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,539
I just, I wish...

256
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:33,351
Here's everything
that I've compiled

257
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,721
over the last three months.

258
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:40,759
Thank you.

259
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,196
We'll be in touch.

260
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:51,729
It says here that he
trained at the old gym

261
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:53,666
out on Westport.

262
00:24:55,934 --> 00:24:59,671
Alexander Rachet runs that gym.

263
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:01,740
I used to train there with him.

264
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,276
Yeah, I didn't wanna
say this before but I,

265
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,713
I knew Daniel Landers.

266
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:11,382
We used to train
together for a while.

267
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:15,154
Rose.

268
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:15,853
Rose!

269
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,188
Yes?

270
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:19,291
What are you thinking?

271
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:22,895
I was just thinking,

272
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:26,465
he left behind everything.

273
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:28,234
His whole identity.

274
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:32,236
Who does that?

275
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,874
Someone scared. Someone running.

276
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:39,545
Even when you're scared,
you take some things.

277
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:44,715
Access to cash, identification.

278
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:46,884
Something.

279
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,521
Maybe it all happened too fast.

280
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:51,689
He didn't have time.

281
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:53,492
No.

282
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,627
When someone leaves behind
their identity it's because

283
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:58,496
they plan on getting a new one.

284
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,399
Jake Ballard.

285
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:06,804
Yes.

286
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,809
Jake Ballard.

287
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:29,053
What y'all doin' here?

288
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:31,357
You're trespassin'!

289
00:27:34,426 --> 00:27:36,528
Keep that witch away from me!

290
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:38,297
Look man, we just wanna
ask you a few questions.

291
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,999
I ain't got nothin'
to say to you!

292
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:46,937
Hey hey hey hey.
Don't do that again.

293
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:49,608
I want y'all off my property!

294
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,676
Look...

295
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,911
Rose!

296
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:54,913
Just go on, just go on now.

297
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:57,616
I don't wanna hurt you.

298
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:59,051
Rose.

299
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,623
Just, don't go no further.

300
00:28:05,657 --> 00:28:08,060
Just back up.

301
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:10,028
Don't make me hurt you.

302
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:20,039
You're not going to hurt me.

303
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:31,516
Just get your ass in the house.

304
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:40,758
What y'all want?

305
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,461
Did someone named Daniel
Landers come to you

306
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:44,396
for some new documents?

307
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:45,596
What kind of documents?

308
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:46,831
I don't know anything
about any documents.

309
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:49,868
The documents your
create for fugitives.

310
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,902
Did you create those
for Daniel Landers?

311
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,038
Well, I...

312
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:55,407
Do you think that
you can lie to me?

313
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,575
Do you think I don't
know the lies in your mind

314
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,610
-birthing as we speak?
-Well, I just...

315
00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:01,480
Another lie!

316
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:03,715
This guy. Hey!

317
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:06,517
This guy, have you seen him?

318
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:09,521
Have you seen him?

319
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:12,858
Don't make me do this.

320
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,926
Tell me what you know.

321
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,970
He came for a new passport.
Birth certificate, the works.

322
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:27,406
Did he say where he was going?

323
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:28,672
They never do and I never ask!

324
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:30,475
Don't lie.

325
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:32,844
He's not lying.

326
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,480
He doesn't know.

327
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:37,850
Like she said, I don't know!

328
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:56,066
Come on, let's get out of here.

329
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,769
Wait.

330
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:59,838
There's something else.

331
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,775
Damnit.

332
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,463
Enough!

333
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:25,729
Okay, okay okay!

334
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:26,898
Tell me what you know.

335
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,934
Okay, there was
somebody with him.

336
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,169
A women, I never
seen her before.

337
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:33,238
What was her name?

338
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:35,874
I don't know!

339
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:36,907
What was her name!

340
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,543
He doesn't know.

341
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,179
Tell me what else you know.

342
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,249
She was black.

343
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,918
Short with long hair.

344
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:52,858
That's it, that's it.

345
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,827
Look, I said that's it, I swear!

346
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,038
The chain is slicker
than she think!

347
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,765
So I'II...

348
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,102
I'll wait in the car.

349
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,768
Here we go.

350
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:12,604
Harder! Come on!

351
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:14,906
My wife hits harder than you.

352
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:16,140
All right.

353
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:19,911
Harder!

354
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,649
Come on, put some snap into it!

355
00:32:25,683 --> 00:32:26,850
All right, good.

356
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:28,720
Now, face me. There we go.

357
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:29,687
Here it comes.

358
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,156
No, no!

359
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:32,890
Here!

360
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:35,926
All right, all
right. Try it again.

361
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,863
All right. Harder!

362
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,734
It's all right.

363
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,970
It's okay.

364
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:47,638
Go and hit the shower.

365
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:50,941
Unbelievable.

366
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,310
You haven't changed
a bit, old man.

367
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:54,311
As bitter as an old
sock dipped in vinegar.

368
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:56,313
My God, look what
the devil drug in.

369
00:32:56,347 --> 00:32:57,950
Ha!

370
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:02,354
Would it hurt you to check in
on an old man once in a while?

371
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:05,223
I know, I should
have done better.

372
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,057
I could use some help
with these young punks.

373
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,193
Really?

374
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:10,361
You saw what I was
doin'. Snap some.

375
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:13,665
That's what I'm talkin' about.

376
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:16,100
Come on.

377
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,204
Shit.

378
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:28,112
I'm getting too
old for this shit.

379
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:29,681
Well these boys need you.

380
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,716
What these boys need is
a swift kick in the ass.

381
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,020
That's what they need.

382
00:33:45,228 --> 00:33:46,230
No.

383
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:49,167
All right.

384
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:54,773
So!

385
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:57,842
What can I do you for?

386
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:02,080
Daniel Landers.

387
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,947
What about him?

388
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,384
I'm investigating
his disappearance.

389
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:09,020
Investigating.

390
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,056
Yes, for his wife.

391
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:13,123
Well I told the police
everything I knew

392
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:14,758
a couple of months ago.

393
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:17,996
Yeah, but I want you to tell
me what you didn't tell them.

394
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:21,933
What good can come from
pissing on a dead man's grave

395
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:23,467
Who said he was dead?

396
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,803
Man leaves town,
doesn't wanna be found.

397
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:27,972
Just about as good
as dead, isn't he?

398
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:32,744
I'm just trying to help
his wife get some closure.

399
00:34:32,777 --> 00:34:35,346
Closure. How about you?

400
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:36,880
You get closure?

401
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:39,884
I'm working on it.

402
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:42,821
Yeah, I heard you're working
with that Ricard woman.

403
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:43,888
Yes.

404
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,991
Does she know about your past?

405
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:49,127
What, haven't you heard?
She knows everything.

406
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:53,732
Well, what's that like?

407
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:58,136
I mean, being with a woman
who can read your mind?

408
00:34:58,168 --> 00:34:59,904
She doesn't read minds.

409
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:01,239
What's the difference?

410
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:02,306
It's like walking around
buck naked with your dick

411
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:06,010
hanging out all day.

412
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:10,815
Well, she takes care of
me and I take care of her.

413
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,399
Tell me a little bit
more about Landers.

414
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,503
Daniel.

415
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:33,438
One of the best fighters
I ever worked with.

416
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:34,839
Heavy hands.

417
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,840
Lightning fast.

418
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:40,477
His footwork
defense, impeccable.

419
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:42,781
But...

420
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,815
he wanted a title shot.

421
00:35:44,848 --> 00:35:47,151
What's wrong with that?

422
00:35:47,185 --> 00:35:50,822
Desperate people
do desperate things.

423
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:54,958
Look, what I'm gonna tell
you not a lot of people know

424
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:59,163
but that fight was a set up.

425
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,399
A set up?

426
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,868
Some big money from Vegas,

427
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,839
they arranged him
to take a dive.

428
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:10,274
Daniel, he was supposed
to get half his purse,

429
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:12,811
word is, he stiffed him.

430
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:14,179
He didn't even pay him.

431
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:17,549
I mean, maybe it's their
way of cleaning up a mess.

432
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,949
I don't know.

433
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,451
And Razer?

434
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:24,989
Died in a drunken car wreck.

435
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:26,991
Razer didn't drink.

436
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:28,993
You and I know that.

437
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:35,333
But Daniel, Daniel got his shot.

438
00:36:38,536 --> 00:36:41,505
That could have
been you, you know.

439
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:45,944
But so much rage, so much anger.

440
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:47,946
You were bound to burn out.

441
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:51,281
I didn't burn out. All I
needed was some guidance.

442
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:53,418
Maybe if you put the same into
me that you put into Landers

443
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:55,887
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

444
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,489
I loved you like a son.

445
00:36:58,522 --> 00:37:01,491
There was a deep dark hole
inside of you that nothing

446
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:05,463
would fill, not me, not nothin'.

447
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:10,901
Take care of yourself, old man.

448
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:18,009
Shit.

449
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:39,530
Rose.

450
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,334
Hey, are you okay?

451
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:45,069
Yes.

452
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,105
I'm fine.

453
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:51,109
What did Rachet say?

454
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:52,977
He said a lot.

455
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:56,580
Daniel's championship
fight was a set up.

456
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:59,516
Razer was paid to take a dive.

457
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:01,985
Daniel was supposed
to split the purse

458
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,223
with the guys who set
it up, but he never did.

459
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,223
Well that's
certainly a reason for

460
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:07,325
someone to want you dead.

461
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:08,926
Yeah, right.

462
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,696
And these are the type of
people that wanna disappear from.

463
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:13,997
That still doesn't
explain the mystery woman

464
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:16,366
that Jake Ballard mentioned.

465
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,936
Well he did give
me one other lead.

466
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:22,040
Some little jazz house
on Williams street

467
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:25,076
which is a front for
prostitution among other things.

468
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:29,413
Apparently Daniel was a
very frequent customer there.

469
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:34,585
I'm not feeling very well.

470
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:37,522
Perhaps you can
just take me home

471
00:38:37,554 --> 00:38:41,125
and see what you can find
out there on your own?

472
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:42,659
Of course.

473
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,642
Are you sure there's
nothing I can do?

474
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:02,714
Yes...

475
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:04,648
I'm sure.

476
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,652
You know, I can come in and
just make sure everything

477
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:09,321
is all right.

478
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:13,424
I'll be fine.

479
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,159
Okay.

480
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:20,031
It's very kind of you.

481
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,302
Okay.

482
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:01,505
Will these pass internationally?

483
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:03,407
You bet your ass it'll
pass anything domestic

484
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,342
or international.

485
00:40:07,677 --> 00:40:09,813
Can I use your can?

486
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:12,682
Yeah, it's around the corner.

487
00:40:12,715 --> 00:40:15,686
Wipe the damn seat
off when you're done.

488
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:29,700
What the hell are
you doin' in there?

489
00:40:32,837 --> 00:40:34,438
Carter?

490
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:41,545
Carter!

491
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:46,818
What the hell?

492
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:27,157
What's your pleasure tonight?

493
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,860
I'm looking for
some information.

494
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,462
There are much more
interesting things in here

495
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:34,699
than information.

496
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:37,902
Let me pour you up something.

497
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:40,337
Give yourself perspective.

498
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:45,275
Well...

499
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:48,245
I have all the
perspective I need.

500
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,748
Information is what
I'm in search of.

501
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:55,353
Do you remember seeing
this guy in here?

502
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:59,491
You're funny.

503
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:03,226
You don't play well as a cop.

504
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,761
I'm not.

505
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:08,600
Have you seen him?

506
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,504
And I had such
high hopes for you.

507
00:42:14,538 --> 00:42:17,407
Yeah but, maybe...

508
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,310
this will help.

509
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:31,689
Okay.

510
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:34,525
All right.

511
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,195
Okay.

512
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:41,499
I have a message
for someone special.

513
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:45,235
This goes out to Grant Summit.

514
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:48,238
We miss you. Come back.

515
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,292
This is my place. I'm Nia.

516
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:17,695
-I'm...
-I know who you are.

517
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,831
How would you know who I am?

518
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:23,734
I know many things.

519
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:26,636
This man that you seek.

520
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,938
Those desires
roaring in your heart.

521
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:31,574
The secrets that
you keep at bay.

522
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:33,543
I'm looking for Daniel Landers.

523
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:35,412
Sit down.

524
00:44:41,784 --> 00:44:43,687
I know Daniel.

525
00:44:45,822 --> 00:44:47,692
You know him?

526
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,995
Then is he alive?

527
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:54,632
A soul never dies, it
simply exists in one reality

528
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:56,900
or the next.

529
00:44:56,933 --> 00:45:00,904
Do you know where
I can find him?

530
00:45:00,938 --> 00:45:03,874
Your grandfather was
a powerful man, very

531
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:07,744
strong, earned his strength
from his father, the slave.

532
00:45:08,846 --> 00:45:10,947
I'm not interested
in your parlor tricks.

533
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,882
Tricks are for those

534
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:15,919
devoid of gifts.

535
00:45:15,953 --> 00:45:17,588
You've seen these gifts before.

536
00:45:17,621 --> 00:45:19,123
No.

537
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:23,728
I've seen God's spirit working
someone in a powerful way.

538
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:27,831
I do know there is another
spirit in this world.

539
00:45:27,864 --> 00:45:30,900
You think I work for the devil.

540
00:45:30,933 --> 00:45:33,903
And no marvel, for Satan himself

541
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:37,475
transformed himself
into the angel of light.

542
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:39,143
Did Rose teach that scripture?

543
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:40,744
And how do you know Rose?

544
00:45:40,777 --> 00:45:43,947
I know many things.

545
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,683
The righteous always
flaunt their wisdom

546
00:45:45,715 --> 00:45:48,786
concerning the
things that they know.

547
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:51,721
What about the things
that they do not know?

548
00:45:51,755 --> 00:45:54,525
Do you know where
I can find Landers?

549
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,527
You love her, don't you?

550
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,496
Do you know where Landers is?

551
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:01,965
You love her very much!

552
00:46:01,998 --> 00:46:04,401
She can feel it, you know.

553
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:08,072
She can also feel the
blood-lust raging within you.

554
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:10,474
She accepts for who I am.

555
00:46:10,507 --> 00:46:12,610
Do you think that you
can solve enough crimes

556
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:14,845
and help enough people
to make a difference?

557
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:18,782
To cleanse your
soul of its sins?

558
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:20,618
God forgives.

559
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,485
God's forgiveness may
get you into heaven

560
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:25,855
but it won't help you
at all here on Earth.

561
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:29,494
Acceptance is greater
than forgiveness.

562
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:33,097
You need someone to
accept who you are,

563
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,800
to believe that there is good

564
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:38,668
living alongside
the evil within you.

565
00:46:38,701 --> 00:46:41,571
You sound like the serpent.

566
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:44,909
From the garden of Eden.

567
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:52,081
I'll keep my ears open
about Daniel Landers.

568
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:55,618
But if I were you, I would go
check back on Alexander Rachet

569
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:58,923
he knows more than he's saying.

570
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:06,164
Come back when you
want some answers.

571
00:47:08,665 --> 00:47:10,701
About yourself.

572
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:09,259
Jake Ballard was
killed last night.

573
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:10,895
What?

574
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:12,996
I heard it over the wire.

575
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:14,163
How?

576
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:16,534
Brutally.

577
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:20,137
Someone...

578
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,007
is trying to cover their tracks.

579
00:48:25,775 --> 00:48:28,645
What is it?

580
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,982
We need to get over to the gym.

581
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,056
I want you to keep the
perimeter locked down

582
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:14,357
and I need a list of
everybody who was in

583
00:49:14,391 --> 00:49:15,726
and out of here today.

584
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:17,628
I called the manager,
he's on his way.

585
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:18,796
Just let me know
when he gets here.

586
00:49:18,828 --> 00:49:19,830
All right.

587
00:49:21,331 --> 00:49:22,366
Rose.

588
00:49:22,398 --> 00:49:24,335
Detective Rigers, what happened?

589
00:49:24,368 --> 00:49:26,070
Well...

590
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:29,072
we had two murders tonight.

591
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:30,640
Strange part is, this
one matches the one out

592
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:32,876
in Scouter County.

593
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:33,844
Jake Ballard?

594
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:35,645
That's right.

595
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,781
He also has his throat
cut from ear to ear.

596
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:38,949
Any leads?

597
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:41,884
No, not yet. You
getting anywhere?

598
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:44,221
I think we're getting somewhere.

599
00:49:44,253 --> 00:49:46,156
Do you have any
information you can offer?

600
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:48,225
-No, all my leads are dead
-ends.

601
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:49,859
Seems like every time
I get a door opened up,

602
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:52,797
someone slams it in my face.

603
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:56,367
Detective Rigers?

604
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:03,607
She's not worth losing
your family over.

605
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:27,330
You gonna be okay?

606
00:50:27,364 --> 00:50:29,032
Yeah, I'm fine.

607
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:32,902
Look, if you don't wanna
tell me, that's fine.

608
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:34,071
Just don't lie to me.

609
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:37,674
This is nothing but the obvious.

610
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,378
This man was like
a father to me.

611
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:53,791
Everyone we talk
to ends up dead.

612
00:50:55,357 --> 00:50:57,293
Except for Abagail.

613
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,465
Take me back to her house.

614
00:51:02,498 --> 00:51:03,833
Why?

615
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:07,370
I have something
I wanna ask her.

616
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:34,732
There's no one here.

617
00:51:38,868 --> 00:51:39,969
Yes, may I help you?

618
00:51:40,002 --> 00:51:41,337
We need to speak
to Mrs. Landers.

619
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,973
She's not here at the moment.

620
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:45,042
When do you expect her?

621
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:47,110
She's unavailable
for a few days.

622
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:48,745
Goodbye.

623
00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:54,719
Let's go.

624
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:29,152
I'll see you tomorrow.

625
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:32,855
I just wanna go over the
police report one more time

626
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:34,358
and...

627
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:36,427
try to get some rest.

628
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:45,902
Grant?

629
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:47,337
Rose?

630
00:52:48,404 --> 00:52:51,908
Why are you just
standing there like that?

631
00:52:51,942 --> 00:52:54,378
You can't tell
what I'm thinking?

632
00:52:55,878 --> 00:52:58,982
You know I'm not a mind reader.

633
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,952
Why haven't you invited
me into the house?

634
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:04,087
I mean, you came and
seen me for six months

635
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,556
and I'm finally out

636
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:08,357
and you act like
we're strangers.

637
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:12,229
My house is my
sanctuary. It's clean.

638
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:14,397
I'm not clean enough
to come into your house?

639
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:16,333
I wasn't saying that.

640
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:19,869
I know how you meant it, I
just don't know if I like it.

641
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:21,571
Grant.

642
00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:30,413
Are you hungry?

643
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:31,549
I am.

644
00:53:33,215 --> 00:53:35,252
Come on in.

645
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:37,554
Let me make you dinner.

646
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:54,204
So my parents had me in
prayer two hours a day,

647
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:58,342
and I never really
had any friends.

648
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,610
Wow.

649
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:03,614
Must have been tough.

650
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:05,982
They said they wanted
to open my spiritual eyes

651
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:08,185
so that I could see people.

652
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:09,953
When they were sure of my gift,

653
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:13,156
it went from two hours to four.

654
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:17,627
I still do it to this day.

655
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:21,465
Four hours of prayer, every day.

656
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:24,235
Yes. Every day.

657
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:28,639
Well, that's commitment.

658
00:54:30,272 --> 00:54:33,610
It's the only way
to quiet my thoughts.

659
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:40,618
Is that how it happens,
you hear a voice?

660
00:54:44,688 --> 00:54:47,057
Not quite.

661
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:52,528
I see it more than I hear it.

662
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:55,464
It's like you're wearing a...

663
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:59,002
white shirt and you have
a grape juice stain on it.

664
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:02,572
And the sin's the stain
and the more sin there is...

665
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,442
the bigger the stain.

666
00:55:06,743 --> 00:55:09,513
Or sometimes I get
this feeling in my gut

667
00:55:09,545 --> 00:55:10,681
that something's not right.

668
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:12,449
You know, everybody
gets that feeling.

669
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:14,384
You've had that feeling
before, haven't you?

670
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:15,719
Yes.

671
00:55:15,752 --> 00:55:17,688
Yeah well,

672
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:19,623
whenever I get it...

673
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:25,162
I'm always right.

674
00:55:26,996 --> 00:55:30,500
How did your family
find out about your gift?

675
00:55:30,532 --> 00:55:34,003
We used to have church,
right in that room.

676
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:37,074
You must be in this world!

677
00:55:37,107 --> 00:55:38,241
Yes, God.

678
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:39,342
But not of this world.

679
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:40,643
Yes.

680
00:55:40,677 --> 00:55:43,613
Then God of this world
is the father lies

681
00:55:43,645 --> 00:55:47,717
and evil and every
source of weakness.

682
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,321
That's why we must
open our spiritual eyes

683
00:55:51,353 --> 00:55:52,522
so we can see!

684
00:55:52,554 --> 00:55:53,690
Yes!

685
00:55:53,723 --> 00:55:55,659
So you can see.

686
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:58,295
Somebody say, "No
more blinded eye."

687
00:55:58,328 --> 00:55:59,463
No more blinded eye.

688
00:55:59,496 --> 00:56:00,664
No more blinded eye!

689
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:02,499
No more blinded eyes!

690
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:05,668
But we wrestle not
against flesh and blood

691
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:09,138
but against principalities,
against powers,

692
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:12,676
against the rulers of the
darkness of this world!

693
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:17,346
Against spiritual wickedness
in the high places!

694
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,583
There's a monster
under your bed.

695
00:56:19,616 --> 00:56:21,752
A demon in your closet!

696
00:56:21,784 --> 00:56:25,054
So you can't fight him,
if you can't see him!

697
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,156
That's why you need the power!

698
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,092
Holy Ghost!

699
00:56:32,728 --> 00:56:37,333
Mrs. Belaire, God sees
the lies on your tongue.

700
00:56:38,301 --> 00:56:41,572
The sin in your words are
stench to God's nostrils.

701
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:44,273
Mr. Moy...

702
00:56:45,775 --> 00:56:49,646
the lust in your heart
flows through your blood!

703
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:52,581
Your adulterous flesh
is enmity against God!

704
00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:56,052
Woe unto you, woe unto you!

705
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,258
Hallelujah!

706
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:03,326
Hallelujah!

707
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:21,311
I just don't understand why.

708
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:24,714
What?

709
00:57:24,746 --> 00:57:28,685
For all that you can
see, you don't see me.

710
00:57:30,152 --> 00:57:33,656
I think we're too close.

711
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,826
Feelings are deceptive.

712
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,162
What's wrong with
having feelings?

713
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:42,198
They cloud my
judgement. My gift.

714
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:46,335
I need to be clear.

715
00:57:46,368 --> 00:57:48,571
Clean to receive.

716
00:58:02,585 --> 00:58:04,188
Grant...

717
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:09,191
I'm not the woman for you.

718
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,862
I'm not the woman for anyone.

719
00:58:11,895 --> 00:58:14,697
Don't a man get to decide that?

720
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:20,302
I just...

721
00:58:20,335 --> 00:58:22,304
I can't let myself
feel those feelings.

722
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:25,174
I can't be open that way.

723
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:30,846
Do you believe that
God would give you...

724
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,851
a gift like this and
have you bear it alone?

725
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:45,529
What if I'm your gift?

726
00:58:50,266 --> 00:58:53,369
Why would God do that to you?

727
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,339
What do you mean?

728
00:58:57,373 --> 00:58:59,543
I would have died in
that chair waiting.

729
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:04,380
Withering away.

730
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:09,685
You saved me.

731
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:16,192
Only God saves.

732
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:27,471
You can let yourself out.

733
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:00,864
I'm sorry.

734
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:03,467
For what?

735
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:07,837
For your sadness.

736
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:10,273
Your rejection.

737
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:14,778
At least you told her
there's a freedom in it.

738
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,380
There's always a price
to pay for freedom.

739
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:20,016
That something your
grandfather taught you?

740
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:21,752
Stop.

741
01:01:25,755 --> 01:01:28,692
Rose Ricard may see
the sin in a man...

742
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,964
but I see the whole man,
the good and the bad.

743
01:01:36,366 --> 01:01:39,802
It's unnatural for a
man to try to be perfect.

744
01:01:42,138 --> 01:01:44,607
He needs an outlet.

745
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:49,946
For his rage.

746
01:01:49,978 --> 01:01:52,482
For his masculinity.

747
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,985
I want you to be
the man that you are.

748
01:01:57,018 --> 01:01:58,721
The good, the bad.

749
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:01,124
The in-between.

750
01:02:16,105 --> 01:02:19,007
When I met Rose, she
was coming to the prison

751
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,876
to visit some inmates.

752
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:23,013
She would pray with them.

753
01:02:24,714 --> 01:02:26,850
She heard about my
case and I told her

754
01:02:26,882 --> 01:02:30,353
like I told everybody,
I was innocent.

755
01:02:33,188 --> 01:02:34,891
I could see in her eyes
that she didn't believe me

756
01:02:34,924 --> 01:02:36,960
but she didn't care.

757
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:40,397
She kept coming to see me.

758
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,700
At the time I didn't
know about her...

759
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:46,369
gift.

760
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:57,446
You beat to death three
men with your bare hands.

761
01:02:58,781 --> 01:03:01,551
You told them it
was self-defense.

762
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,052
But it wasn't.

763
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:06,622
They thought it was,
because it was three of them

764
01:03:06,656 --> 01:03:08,157
and one of you.

765
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,627
I went looking for them.

766
01:03:12,862 --> 01:03:14,531
The men that lynched
my grandfather.

767
01:03:14,563 --> 01:03:15,864
And you made them pay.

768
01:03:15,897 --> 01:03:17,800
Damn right.

769
01:03:24,507 --> 01:03:27,476
When I asked them about it...

770
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,612
they said my grandfather wasn't

771
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:33,182
little more than
a two-cent slave.

772
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,852
And I know why I
wouldn't ever know

773
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:39,156
that they're guilty.

774
01:03:41,022 --> 01:03:43,459
And with grave-intent...

775
01:03:45,094 --> 01:03:46,830
I avenged my grandfather.

776
01:03:46,862 --> 01:03:49,598
And that was the
right thing to do.

777
01:03:56,806 --> 01:03:59,676
Rose...

778
01:04:01,277 --> 01:04:03,679
she stayed by my side.

779
01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:08,484
She said when I got
out, I'd have a job,

780
01:04:08,518 --> 01:04:10,619
and a place to stay.

781
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:14,590
She needed you more
than you needed her.

782
01:04:14,623 --> 01:04:17,226
How...

783
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:18,927
how do you know
so much about Rose?

784
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,497
We grew up together.

785
01:04:21,531 --> 01:04:23,933
And then I had to move away.

786
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:27,936
You see my future, right?

787
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:31,540
The future is full of
possibilities, but...

788
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,744
yes.

789
01:04:34,777 --> 01:04:36,679
I can see yours clearly.

790
01:05:28,797 --> 01:05:30,533
Lift your hands.

791
01:05:32,601 --> 01:05:35,304
You're healed by the
blood of the lamb.

792
01:05:35,337 --> 01:05:37,239
Be free.

793
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,085
Daughter.

794
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:55,558
Come.

795
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:03,198
My daughter.

796
01:06:03,232 --> 01:06:06,268
You are meant for greatness

797
01:06:06,302 --> 01:06:09,806
but the weight of your
sin is decaying your faith.

798
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,342
Be set free from bondage.

799
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:17,813
Be set free from your bondage.

800
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:20,649
Be free.

801
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:22,953
Be free from your bondage.

802
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:25,922
Do you wanna be free?

803
01:06:25,955 --> 01:06:28,190
Yeah.

804
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,893
Yeah, I wanna be free.

805
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:36,232
Don't you wanna be free?

806
01:06:36,264 --> 01:06:38,667
Don't you wanna be free?

807
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:40,770
Yeah, I wanna be free.

808
01:06:40,802 --> 01:06:42,270
Be free!

809
01:06:42,304 --> 01:06:44,273
Be free.

810
01:06:47,342 --> 01:06:49,078
Hallelujah!

811
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,980
Yes, I wanna be free!

812
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:15,938
How does it feel,

813
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:19,108
to have killed a man
with your bare hands?

814
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:24,313
I can still feel the
anger inside of you.

815
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:26,748
Come on.

816
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,417
Wake up.

817
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:31,788
Come on.

818
01:07:31,821 --> 01:07:33,422
Come on, be free, baby.

819
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:39,963
Yes!

820
01:07:41,864 --> 01:07:44,967
I want you to take me.

821
01:07:49,505 --> 01:07:51,241
Yes!

822
01:07:55,243 --> 01:07:57,112
You want it?

823
01:07:57,145 --> 01:07:58,046
That's right.

824
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,248
Take it.

825
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,121
You've gotta let God do it!

826
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,138
God.

827
01:08:38,387 --> 01:08:42,023
You know I could have
walked, but thank you.

828
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:45,361
It's absolutely my pleasure.

829
01:08:45,393 --> 01:08:47,329
Are you okay?

830
01:08:47,362 --> 01:08:49,097
Yeah.

831
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,834
You seem a little distracted.

832
01:08:53,268 --> 01:08:55,204
Maybe a little.

833
01:08:57,106 --> 01:09:00,309
Rose, to whom much is given,

834
01:09:00,342 --> 01:09:03,212
much is required.

835
01:09:03,245 --> 01:09:06,849
But remember, emotions
cloud your discernment.

836
01:09:06,882 --> 01:09:09,451
Separate it,

837
01:09:09,485 --> 01:09:11,987
and you'll be just fine.

838
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:23,499
Good night.

839
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:25,066
Good night, Rose Ricard.

840
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:53,042
You should get your phone.

841
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,293
Rose?

842
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:14,429
Yeah. You okay?

843
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:17,566
Yeah.

844
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:20,268
Okay okay okay, I tell you what.

845
01:13:20,302 --> 01:13:22,105
I'm on my way, I'll be there.

846
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:25,240
Stay with me.

847
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:29,212
I have to go.

848
01:13:31,446 --> 01:13:34,150
I need you.

849
01:13:34,182 --> 01:13:36,319
She needs me.

850
01:14:01,576 --> 01:14:03,178
Rose!

851
01:14:11,652 --> 01:14:13,321
Rose!

852
01:14:19,393 --> 01:14:21,364
Are you okay?

853
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:40,115
I'm sorry.

854
01:14:40,148 --> 01:14:41,316
Nia

855
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,585
Nia's my sister.

856
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:46,588
Sister?

857
01:14:50,926 --> 01:14:52,727
I didn't know.

858
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:42,304
Daddy! Please don't go.

859
01:16:42,337 --> 01:16:43,405
I just had a vision.

860
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:44,639
A vision of what, sweetheart?

861
01:16:44,673 --> 01:16:46,742
Something really bad.

862
01:16:46,775 --> 01:16:48,578
Nia, let your father go.

863
01:16:50,279 --> 01:16:53,014
You shouldn't tell tales, Nia.

864
01:16:53,048 --> 01:16:54,617
Don't covet your sister's gift,

865
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,451
you'll have a gift
of your own one day.

866
01:16:56,485 --> 01:16:59,722
No, I promise I
really did see it.

867
01:16:59,754 --> 01:17:01,257
Maybe you should
listen to her, Clarence.

868
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:01,990
Ella, don't encourage.

869
01:17:02,023 --> 01:17:03,359
Please don't go!

870
01:17:03,392 --> 01:17:04,460
Listen, I've told
you about that lying

871
01:17:04,493 --> 01:17:06,462
and I want you to stop it.

872
01:17:06,495 --> 01:17:08,731
Fear is of the devil,
you understand me?

873
01:17:08,763 --> 01:17:09,431
Yes, but...

874
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:10,598
No buts!

875
01:17:10,632 --> 01:17:13,602
We'll be back in a
couple of hours. Rose?

876
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,503
Watch your sister.

877
01:17:38,627 --> 01:17:39,895
Wait!

878
01:17:43,565 --> 01:17:46,035
Daddy!

879
01:17:46,067 --> 01:17:47,969
Daddy, wait.

880
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,826
Nia. Nia!

881
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:14,730
I hate you!

882
01:18:17,432 --> 01:18:18,934
We found out later that
day that our parents

883
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:21,504
had been killed
in a car accident.

884
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:29,378
That's why I don't
drive 'til this day.

885
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:37,619
So, what do we do now?

886
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:41,891
We move on.

887
01:18:43,023 --> 01:18:46,594
Grant, I know that you
weren't trying to hurt me.

888
01:18:47,829 --> 01:18:51,067
And without forgiveness,
there can be no redemption.

889
01:18:54,535 --> 01:18:56,437
Forgiveness.

890
01:18:56,471 --> 01:18:59,040
Yes.

891
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:07,048
You have to forgive the men
that killed your grandfather.

892
01:19:21,596 --> 01:19:24,700
My mother died when I was ten

893
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:27,002
and my father was never around.

894
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:30,873
But my grandfather,

895
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,509
he was my hero.

896
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:38,780
He taught me how to be a man.

897
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:51,660
You never told me
how it happened.

898
01:19:56,865 --> 01:19:58,634
It was just a regular day.

899
01:20:00,535 --> 01:20:04,606
We were walking
home from fishing.

900
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:06,174
They pulled up on
us with some guns

901
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,911
and made us get in
the back of that truck.

902
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:14,482
I was so scared but
my grandfather wasn't.

903
01:20:14,516 --> 01:20:17,152
It's like he knew
something I didn't.

904
01:20:20,922 --> 01:20:23,625
They dragged in the woods and

905
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:27,096
tied us up and beat on us
for what seemed like hours.

906
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:31,834
Laughing...

907
01:20:31,866 --> 01:20:34,536
drinking and pissing on us.

908
01:20:37,071 --> 01:20:39,907
And then...

909
01:20:39,941 --> 01:20:42,511
they made me watch.

910
01:20:44,145 --> 01:20:48,450
As they strung my grandfather
up on an old oak tree and...

911
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:54,690
the last thing he said to me,
"Boy, don't you feel no fear!

912
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:58,494
"Don't you feel no fear!"

913
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:05,100
When a man sees
something like that...

914
01:21:06,901 --> 01:21:10,004
he ain't never
gonna be right again.

915
01:21:14,075 --> 01:21:17,513
That day all I wanted
to do was die too.

916
01:21:23,552 --> 01:21:25,221
I know.

917
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,643
We have to go to the office.

918
01:21:48,977 --> 01:21:50,779
Why?

919
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:52,715
Just a feeling.

920
01:22:17,638 --> 01:22:20,074
I'm just thinking
if they get there,

921
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:22,744
because one more dead
body's not gonna...

922
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:26,614
Rose, Mrs. Landers
is here to see you.

923
01:22:26,647 --> 01:22:27,748
Good afternoon.

924
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,650
Good afternoon, Mrs. Landers.

925
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:31,085
We weren't expecting you.

926
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:32,286
I know.

927
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,188
I wanted to thank you
for all of your help

928
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:36,090
in trying to find my husband.

929
01:22:36,124 --> 01:22:38,360
But we're not finished.

930
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:41,128
I've just come to
accept the fact that

931
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:44,066
dead or alive, he
doesn't want to be found.

932
01:22:44,098 --> 01:22:46,334
I wanted you to give me
closure but the truth is,

933
01:22:46,368 --> 01:22:48,904
I needed to find
that for myself.

934
01:22:48,937 --> 01:22:50,672
Thank you for all of your help.

935
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:51,906
Mrs. Landers, we feel that...

936
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:54,375
Rose, I'm sure that
you sense something

937
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:56,911
but I need you to
let it go, okay?

938
01:22:56,945 --> 01:22:58,880
Just let it go.

939
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:11,827
She's afraid of
someone or something.

940
01:23:13,828 --> 01:23:16,397
We need to get to Harvey's.

941
01:23:16,431 --> 01:23:18,366
You know I can't go there.

942
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,303
There are answers
there that we need.

943
01:23:38,152 --> 01:23:41,923
You haven't been back here
since the incident, have you?

944
01:23:43,324 --> 01:23:45,127
No.

945
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,963
Why would I want
to come back here?

946
01:24:02,977 --> 01:24:04,079
Hey.

947
01:24:04,111 --> 01:24:06,147
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

948
01:24:06,181 --> 01:24:07,982
Nonsense.

949
01:24:49,389 --> 01:24:51,026
Why are we here?

950
01:24:51,058 --> 01:24:52,259
I don't know.

951
01:24:52,293 --> 01:24:55,263
I just feel that we're
supposed to be here.

952
01:24:59,234 --> 01:25:01,236
What do you remember?

953
01:25:02,203 --> 01:25:04,272
I remember everything.

954
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:15,182
He sat right there.

955
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:16,919
Rutger came in last.

956
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,955
Laughing.

957
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:26,294
When did you make up your mind?

958
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:29,231
I knew I was going to
kill him before I even went

959
01:25:29,263 --> 01:25:31,065
into the building.

960
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:40,075
Just five feet away. He
didn't even notice me.

961
01:25:44,512 --> 01:25:48,016
I wish...

962
01:25:48,048 --> 01:25:50,953
I could kill him all over again.

963
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,495
It's Abagail.

964
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:05,000
Yes.

965
01:26:14,575 --> 01:26:18,012
Now who do you suppose
is gonna walk in next?

966
01:26:19,047 --> 01:26:20,949
You already know.

967
01:26:26,254 --> 01:26:27,889
Daniel.

968
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:29,924
Don't.

969
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,494
Just...

970
01:26:32,526 --> 01:26:34,128
watch.

971
01:26:46,607 --> 01:26:48,909
I did what you asked me to.

972
01:26:48,942 --> 01:26:50,378
Did you bring the
rest of the money?

973
01:26:50,410 --> 01:26:52,179
It's in the trunk.

974
01:26:52,213 --> 01:26:53,514
Keys are under the seat.

975
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:55,884
Good.

976
01:26:58,151 --> 01:27:00,020
Take the black phone and
throw it into the river

977
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:02,089
on the way home.

978
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:04,393
How will you be
able to reach me?

979
01:27:06,628 --> 01:27:09,130
Two days I'll send word.

980
01:27:16,137 --> 01:27:17,539
Go now.

981
01:27:26,213 --> 01:27:27,582
Don't.

982
01:27:48,136 --> 01:27:50,004
Alex said you hit hard.

983
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:53,040
You hit like a fucking girl.

984
01:27:56,611 --> 01:27:59,047
Come on, man.
That's all you got?

985
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:01,348
Come on. You got
some more, I know.

986
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:36,151
Get out.

987
01:28:37,718 --> 01:28:39,620
Hey, I'm gonna drive
her over to the house.

988
01:28:39,654 --> 01:28:42,190
You meet me there, okay?

989
01:28:42,222 --> 01:28:45,259
Pick me up there in
just a few minutes.

990
01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:47,529
Okay, okay.

991
01:28:47,562 --> 01:28:49,531
I'm go and ask if
anybody knows anything.

992
01:28:49,563 --> 01:28:51,499
Be careful.

993
01:28:51,531 --> 01:28:53,334
You drive!

994
01:28:57,338 --> 01:29:00,375
Stop the car, I'm not
gonna ask you again.

995
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:02,511
Okay, okay!

996
01:29:04,245 --> 01:29:07,082
Someone delivered a phone
to my house yesterday.

997
01:29:07,115 --> 01:29:09,217
At 5PM it rang.

998
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:11,051
-It was Daniel.
-Yes!

999
01:29:11,084 --> 01:29:13,721
What did he say?

1000
01:29:13,754 --> 01:29:15,757
He said that he was alive

1001
01:29:15,789 --> 01:29:17,993
and that he had to
disappear because

1002
01:29:18,026 --> 01:29:19,227
because of this
money that he owed

1003
01:29:19,259 --> 01:29:20,594
to the Las Vegas racketeers.

1004
01:29:20,628 --> 01:29:23,764
Where has he been all this time?

1005
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:27,703
Here in the city, hiding out.

1006
01:29:29,137 --> 01:29:30,672
What else?

1007
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:33,441
That's all I know, I swear.

1008
01:29:49,123 --> 01:29:50,325
Get out of the car.

1009
01:29:50,357 --> 01:29:52,761
-What?
-Get out of the car!

1010
01:30:08,709 --> 01:30:11,613
Grant, I need you
to meet me at Nia's.

1011
01:30:11,646 --> 01:30:13,715
I'm on my way.

1012
01:30:15,148 --> 01:30:17,585
Yeah. Okay.

1013
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:26,227
God...

1014
01:30:26,259 --> 01:30:27,329
please.

1015
01:30:31,231 --> 01:30:33,467
Please give me strength.

1016
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:43,838
I'm looking for Nia.

1017
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:46,673
She's not here.

1018
01:31:46,706 --> 01:31:49,276
You're lying.

1019
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:50,745
And what if I am?

1020
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:57,252
I'm not very fond of liars.

1021
01:32:03,324 --> 01:32:05,326
There.

1022
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:59,646
-My long
-lost sister, at last.

1023
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:00,882
Nia.

1024
01:33:03,517 --> 01:33:04,819
No hugs?

1025
01:33:07,021 --> 01:33:10,659
No kisses? No illustration
of love whatsoever?

1026
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:16,665
Why, you'd think
we were strangers.

1027
01:33:18,499 --> 01:33:20,468
Don't.

1028
01:33:23,004 --> 01:33:25,640
You think I'd hurt
my only sister?

1029
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,810
I know what you're doing.

1030
01:33:28,843 --> 01:33:32,313
What am I doing exactly?

1031
01:33:32,346 --> 01:33:34,616
I see your manipulation.

1032
01:33:35,883 --> 01:33:38,019
I know you've been watching.

1033
01:33:38,052 --> 01:33:40,621
Following me.

1034
01:33:40,655 --> 01:33:42,757
It was you in the black SUV.

1035
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:44,491
Of course it was.

1036
01:33:46,893 --> 01:33:48,929
Why?

1037
01:33:48,963 --> 01:33:50,331
Nia, I know...

1038
01:33:50,364 --> 01:33:53,801
You know how I'm feeling?

1039
01:33:53,834 --> 01:33:57,739
You couldn't possibly
how I'm feeling!

1040
01:33:57,771 --> 01:33:59,940
Your gift is weak!

1041
01:33:59,973 --> 01:34:01,810
It's feeble.

1042
01:34:03,878 --> 01:34:06,748
It's your fault mommy
and daddy died that day.

1043
01:34:08,014 --> 01:34:10,517
All these years I've
wonder, "Who do I hate more?"

1044
01:34:10,551 --> 01:34:14,722
Mom and Dad for not
believing in my gifts, or you?

1045
01:34:16,356 --> 01:34:17,758
I...

1046
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:19,526
I made a mistake and...

1047
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,995
No, a mistake,

1048
01:34:21,027 --> 01:34:23,463
is made without the knowledge

1049
01:34:23,496 --> 01:34:24,499
of consequences!

1050
01:34:24,531 --> 01:34:27,668
What you did was much worse!

1051
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:30,370
It's as if you put the gun
to their head and shot it!

1052
01:34:30,404 --> 01:34:32,507
Why kill all these people?

1053
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:36,743
My God.

1054
01:34:36,776 --> 01:34:38,812
You still don't understand,
I didn't kill anybody.

1055
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,848
I can taste your lies.

1056
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,982
Stop lying!

1057
01:34:42,016 --> 01:34:46,321
Poor Rose.

1058
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:49,490
So confused.

1059
01:34:49,522 --> 01:34:51,491
So flushed with revelation

1060
01:34:51,525 --> 01:34:53,527
and so little understanding.

1061
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:57,432
You used Daniel
Landers to draw me in.

1062
01:34:57,464 --> 01:34:59,766
Daniel was customer.

1063
01:34:59,799 --> 01:35:02,669
He needed to disappear, I
helped him get a new identity.

1064
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:06,007
And then you made sure
that detective Rigers

1065
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:07,774
sent Abagail to me.

1066
01:35:07,807 --> 01:35:11,011
Do you think that you can deny

1067
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:12,045
my existence?

1068
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,016
I never tried to deny you!

1069
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:19,053
I just didn't know
what to say to you!

1070
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:26,328
You can tell detective
Rigers he can come out now.

1071
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:38,039
Very good, Rose.

1072
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:41,775
Another one of your customers?

1073
01:35:41,808 --> 01:35:43,143
We have a simple
business arrangement.

1074
01:35:43,177 --> 01:35:45,012
He does a few things for me,

1075
01:35:45,044 --> 01:35:47,514
his wife doesn't find out
about his frequent visits

1076
01:35:47,548 --> 01:35:48,883
to my establishment.

1077
01:35:48,915 --> 01:35:52,486
What can I say? I'm insatiable.

1078
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,755
I thought it was you.

1079
01:35:54,789 --> 01:35:57,558
You came into my home.

1080
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:58,959
Guilty.

1081
01:35:58,993 --> 01:36:02,096
You tried to kill me.

1082
01:36:02,129 --> 01:36:04,599
No, he didn't try to kill you.

1083
01:36:06,633 --> 01:36:10,003
That pleasure belongs to me.

1084
01:36:11,172 --> 01:36:13,174
No! Nia!

1085
01:36:13,206 --> 01:36:15,042
-Stop!
-Die!

1086
01:36:15,075 --> 01:36:18,012
-Please, stop!
-Die!

1087
01:36:18,044 --> 01:36:21,682
I want you to feel
the pain that I feel!

1088
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:25,620
Please!

1089
01:36:25,652 --> 01:36:26,788
Nia!

1090
01:37:52,806 --> 01:37:54,542
Are you coming in?

1091
01:37:58,646 --> 01:38:01,983
I'm figuring you
want to be left alone.

1092
01:38:02,016 --> 01:38:04,252
You're probably right.

1093
01:38:12,026 --> 01:38:14,729
You know, there's something that

1094
01:38:14,762 --> 01:38:17,130
I still don't understand.

1095
01:38:17,164 --> 01:38:20,034
Yes.

1096
01:38:20,066 --> 01:38:24,804
When you came up the
stairs at Nia's you...

1097
01:38:24,838 --> 01:38:26,941
you shot detective
Rigers without hesitation.

1098
01:38:26,973 --> 01:38:29,944
How did you know
he was the killer?

1099
01:38:31,145 --> 01:38:33,313
Well...

1100
01:38:33,347 --> 01:38:35,148
when I came upstairs
I saw detective Rigers

1101
01:38:35,182 --> 01:38:36,617
just looking at Nia
trying to kill you

1102
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,819
so I figured that
couldn't be good.

1103
01:38:38,852 --> 01:38:40,922
So I took the shot.

1104
01:38:42,056 --> 01:38:43,958
That makes sense.

1105
01:38:45,191 --> 01:38:46,860
Okay, Rose.

1106
01:38:57,704 --> 01:39:00,173
But wouldn't you hesitate...

1107
01:39:00,206 --> 01:39:02,276
just a little?

1108
01:39:14,088 --> 01:39:15,656
I was wondering how
long it was gonna take

1109
01:39:15,688 --> 01:39:17,825
for you to figure it out.

1110
01:39:19,959 --> 01:39:22,862
You know, if I
had to chose a gift

1111
01:39:22,896 --> 01:39:24,732
it wouldn't be this one.

1112
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,603
Knowing the things
I wish I didn't know

1113
01:39:29,637 --> 01:39:32,907
and not knowing the
things I wish I did.

1114
01:39:34,807 --> 01:39:37,878
Always God's will
what is revealed.

1115
01:39:40,114 --> 01:39:43,951
Tell me why.

1116
01:39:43,984 --> 01:39:45,820
Why?

1117
01:39:45,852 --> 01:39:47,654
You know, so many times I
looked into those big ol'

1118
01:39:47,687 --> 01:39:49,656
pretty eyes and I
thought you knew!

1119
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:52,026
But you didn't.

1120
01:39:55,062 --> 01:39:57,064
I never forgave Jake for turning
me down when I went to him

1121
01:39:57,097 --> 01:39:59,967
for help after I
killed those men.

1122
01:39:59,999 --> 01:40:03,704
I tried to leave town, I
bet you didn't know that.

1123
01:40:04,972 --> 01:40:07,407
I went back to Jake's house
that night and as I drove up,

1124
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:10,978
I saw detective Rigers
driving off in the SUV.

1125
01:40:11,978 --> 01:40:14,248
I killed Jake that evening.

1126
01:40:24,857 --> 01:40:27,427
I never forgave those
men for what they

1127
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:30,097
did to my grandfather.

1128
01:40:31,298 --> 01:40:33,134
And I never forgave
Alexander Rachet

1129
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:35,936
for choosing Daniel over me.

1130
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,873
I don't understand,
why are you doing this?

1131
01:40:41,374 --> 01:40:44,177
What are you doing?

1132
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:45,279
No!

1133
01:40:45,312 --> 01:40:46,747
No!

1134
01:40:53,352 --> 01:40:56,123
Damn! I should have
been the boxing champion!

1135
01:40:56,155 --> 01:40:59,960
Alex, boy, he spent
all his time on Daniel!

1136
01:41:01,294 --> 01:41:02,864
And yes...

1137
01:41:04,731 --> 01:41:08,334
Nia wanted to kill you.

1138
01:41:08,368 --> 01:41:10,437
I could see it in her eyes.

1139
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,241
And now what?

1140
01:41:14,273 --> 01:41:17,078
All those visits.

1141
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:19,947
All those visits in prison, you,

1142
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:23,116
you made me believe
you loved me.

1143
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,219
I do love you, Grant.

1144
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:27,487
It's why I couldn't
see you clearly.

1145
01:41:27,521 --> 01:41:29,389
Nah, nah, you never
loved me, man.

1146
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:31,726
You don't love nobody!

1147
01:41:31,758 --> 01:41:33,694
I protected you!

1148
01:41:35,062 --> 01:41:37,265
I would have died for you!

1149
01:41:39,799 --> 01:41:41,369
You know what, Rose?

1150
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:44,338
I got a gift too.

1151
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,977
I am dangerous.

1152
01:42:30,383 --> 01:42:33,987
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.

1153
01:42:57,143 --> 01:42:58,512
Yes, Melissa?

1154
01:42:58,544 --> 01:43:00,480
Tesla Richards is
here to see you?

1155
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:03,351
Yes. Yes, send her in, please.

1156
01:43:08,387 --> 01:43:11,225
Good afternoon, Mrs. Richards.

1157
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:12,994
Hi.

1158
01:43:15,995 --> 01:43:18,932
How can I help you?

1159
01:43:18,965 --> 01:43:22,035
My daughter's been
missing for over a week.

1160
01:43:23,169 --> 01:43:25,205
Rose!

1161
01:43:25,239 --> 01:43:27,808
I don't know what else to do.
