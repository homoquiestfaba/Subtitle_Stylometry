1
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,426
Janni, Jimmy, get in here now!

2
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,668
I'm so tired of all the fighting.
You have no idea!

3
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:33,228
- He hit me first.
- He hit me first.

4
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,270
- Liar!
- I don't care who started it.

5
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:38,600
It has to stop.
I need you two to get along.

6
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:49,651
You understand that one day...

7
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:52,419
...you will inherit my empire, yes?

8
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,816
- What's an empire?
- Shut up.

9
00:01:55,994 --> 00:02:00,954
This will remind you that you
are two halves of one.

10
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:07,261
Together, you are more powerful
than apart. Yes?

11
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,304
What does this mean?

12
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:14,377
One day, you will find out.

13
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,936
Hey, señor.

14
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,516
- Freeze!
- Hi, honey.

15
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:43,061
Just vacuumed this rug, okay?
I got it all even.

16
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,203
Take your shoes off, please.
You know the rule.

17
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:54,072
Now, please, try not to scare Blanche.

18
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:58,205
Don't clunk. You're scaring her!
Look, you scared Blanche now, Jill. Jill!

19
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,381
Be done in a minute. Don't go in.

20
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:03,612
There's a surprise in there! Don't look.

21
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:06,146
Okay.

22
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,892
Finished it up today.

23
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,360
It's all our favorite hit men.
All our favorite hits.

24
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:18,094
Now, I don't think you ever met
Tony "The Tooth." Capped him in Chicago.

25
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,762
I even got the hole in his head where
I whacked him with a 9-iron.

26
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,171
Santo "Three Fingers." Remember
the rat that wouldn't shut up?

27
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:27,277
And, of course, Frankie Figs.

28
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,110
Who could forget Frankie Figs?

29
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:32,512
"Oh, wow, Jimmy, you shot me."

30
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,950
- Poor Frankie.
- Jimmy.

31
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:37,748
- What?
- We need to talk.

32
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:39,820
I mean, I...

33
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,121
I just wanted everything to be perfect
for when the baby came. That's all.

34
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:46,628
That's what we need to talk about.

35
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,894
So how did the hit go?

36
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,295
- Good.
- Really?

37
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:54,597
- So you let him get away.
- No!

38
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,138
- Then he's dead?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,276
- Then what is it?
- I didn't kill him.

40
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:01,444
- But he is dead.
- At first, everything went smooth.

41
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,172
I did everything you said.
I had the taxi, I had the flowers.

42
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,479
Nobody even notices me.
I could have been invisible.

43
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:11,349
You have a problem getting in?

44
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:15,459
Oh, honey, I finally used my lock-pick set!

45
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,858
Like this, I was in there and
I'm waiting and I'm poised...

46
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,966
...I'm cool as a cucumber. All of a sudden,
the frigging guy's phone rings.

47
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:25,291
You flinched.

48
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,461
- I whip my gun around...
- You flinched!

49
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,698
...and I knock over his tomato sauce.

50
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,867
You must stay focused when
you are killing a person!

51
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,079
Then I've got this whole big mess.

52
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,647
The more I try to clean up,
the worse it gets.

53
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:41,582
Tomato sauce is a tough stain to get
out. You need a good grease cutter.

54
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,483
Then finally, I hear the
guy's key in the lock.

55
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,993
Now, let me guess:
Your shotgun's out of reach.

56
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:53,364
So now I gotta think fast.
So I go for my gun...

57
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,557
...he slides across the floor and, well...

58
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:59,602
I would go into detail, but let's just say...

59
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,500
...he left the building.

60
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:09,111
I gotta say, if the guy's dead,
we gotta put this in the win column.

61
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:12,444
Same thing with Spiegelman.
He fell down an elevator shaft.

62
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:15,711
But you were running right
behind him just before he fell.

63
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:19,254
But I just wanna shoot someone!

64
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,466
All right, now. All right, now, baby.

65
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:35,368
Murdering another human being
can be a very moving experience.

66
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,939
Listen.

67
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,803
I got an idea.

68
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:41,605
What do you say we go and kill
somebody, just us?

69
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:46,541
We'll find some drunk tourist, take him to
the beach and put three in his coconut.

70
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,914
What's your favorite gun?

71
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:51,487
- A.45.
- Great.

72
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:54,921
We'll make a big mess.
How does that sound, baby doll?

73
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,391
My roast.

74
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,193
- This isn't working.
- Oven's working fine, Jill.

75
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,998
No, this, this, Jimmy.

76
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,664
I married a contract killer,
not Martha Stewart.

77
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,605
Hey, I am in disguise, okay?

78
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,836
Yeah, well, your disguise is dumb.

79
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,537
I mean, look at yourself.

80
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:20,116
And what are you doing in disguise?
Everyone thinks you're dead.

81
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:22,082
Well, you never can tell, can you?

82
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,380
You are gonna sit and enjoy this meal.

83
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:27,184
I got this recipe from
Mrs. Sanchez next door.

84
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,795
This is a cilantro reduction.
Hey, watch your fingerprints!

85
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:34,796
- I spent the whole morning scrubbing.
- There is something wrong with you.

86
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:38,732
Hey, there is nothing wrong with me.
There is nothing wrong with me.

87
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,963
Every man that has an ongoing
sexual relationship...

88
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,509
...experiences certain peaks and valleys
within his male libido from time to time.

89
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:51,308
Last time we saw a peak was almost a
year ago, Mr. Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski.

90
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:54,816
We're in a valley. We're below
sea level. We're under the water.

91
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:57,716
The Tulip has:

92
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,956
Jimmy the Tulip is alive and well.

93
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,423
I'm not so sure. I saw a doctor in L.A.

94
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,459
This is a cilantro reduction.

95
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:07,291
You marinate the meat
in tequila for 2 1 /2 hours...

96
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:09,399
...and it melts...
- Are you listening?

97
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,932
He said it wasn't me.

98
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,994
Jill, please just come eat.
I have been cooking all day.

99
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:16,970
Jimmy!

100
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,636
You might be shooting blanks.

101
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:22,712
This is not a dumb disguise.
Now, come eat.

102
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,372
Think fast!

103
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,513
- Strabonitz!
- Papa.

104
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,555
This is the best birthday present
I could ever have.

105
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:10,023
Come here. My big boy,
giant in the family.

106
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:14,188
- It's a beautiful day, no?
- Yes.

107
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:15,860
No?

108
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,331
No.

109
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:18,863
"No" meaning "yes."

110
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,403
"No" meaning "yes."

111
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,678
- Get in the car, I'm starving!
- All right.

112
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,076
If I don't eat soon, I'll pass out.

113
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:57,096
Hello, birdie. Tweet, tweet, my friend.
Tweet, tweet.

114
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:04,008
- Babe, you look hot.
- Oz, knock it off.

115
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,819
Just checking out the gyroscopic swivel pan
mechanism. You know, the new one.

116
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:14,720
You checked it three times already this
morning. Nobody is coming, Oz.

117
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:17,724
- Knock it off.
- Okay.

118
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,692
I got it, honey!

119
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,831
- Who sent you?
- Buttercup Scouts of America.

120
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,560
What troop are you with?

121
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,738
- What?
- You heard me.

122
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:04,170
What's your den mother's name?

123
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,543
Carol?

124
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:12,110
Jesus, Oz, what the hell are you doing?

125
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:15,684
- She's a Buttercup Scout.
- I'm not buying this scout routine.

126
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:18,378
Besides, I think there's
something in her hand.

127
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:21,616
Cookies. Minty Thins.

128
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:24,017
This is Ellen Wasserstrom's daughter.

129
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:26,925
I told her mother
I'd buy cookies from her.

130
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:33,727
Putz.

131
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,497
- I heard that!
- Jag-off.

132
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,946
Well, that was a close call, huh?

133
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:45,577
Minty Thins are bad anyway.
They cause staining...

134
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,947
- You've really got to stop this now, Oz.
- I know.

135
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,750
Nobody is coming to get us. They can't
come and get us, because they're all dead.

136
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:56,553
- Or in jail.
- Right.

137
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,794
If you look at that monitor
one more time...

138
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,431
I'll be taking cold showers?

139
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,590
For starters.

140
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,102
You look very nice in that robe.

141
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:34,593
This will make you very happy. I think.

142
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,256
You think, huh?

143
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,629
Well, for starters, I hate the color.

144
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:46,274
So! You are the two that tried to muscle in
on my businesses while I was gone.

145
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:49,936
- No!
- Tell everyone that Lazlo Gogolak...

146
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:52,144
...is back in town.

147
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:00,655
How are they gonna tell
anyone when they're dead?

148
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:02,417
What?

149
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,422
Come here. I love you, boy.

150
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,170
Don't correct me. As a rule.

151
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,872
- What is that? Give it to me.
- Here, boss.

152
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:23,172
Oh, another surprise.

153
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,009
That was fun.

154
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:35,320
Oseransky.

155
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,791
- It's me.
- Oh, hey, Jill, how are you?

156
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:42,331
- How's your new dental assistant?
- Well, she's not trying to kill me.

157
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,468
Never forget the fun we had.

158
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:47,798
- Hey, listen. Can I ask you something?
- Sure, anything.

159
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,803
You think Jimmy and Cynthia talk?

160
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,965
What do you mean? Like you and I talk?

161
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:53,804
No, like, I mean, "talk" talk.

162
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,839
I don't understand. Why would
Jimmy and Cynthia be "talk" talking?

163
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,677
No, Cynthia would tell me.
She tells me everything.

164
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:03,013
- Why?
- He's acting like a fruitcake.

165
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,121
- What, he's killing people?
- I wish.

166
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:10,420
No, he's up to something. He's acting like
he's out of his mind, but I don't believe it.

167
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:14,087
Oh, jeez, a homicidal maniac acting
totally crazy. What a surprise.

168
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:16,495
- Jill!
- I gotta go, I'll talk to you later.

169
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:17,656
Yeah?

170
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,880
- So that's the one we're after?
- Yes.

171
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:40,456
Cost me 1 0,000 to get,
you know, the dental work.

172
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,185
- To find out if it's him.
- Did you save receipts?

173
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,620
- No. What receipts?
- I'm kidding.

174
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:49,731
Nobody saves receipts anymore.
Don't worry. That's why it's funny.

175
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:54,301
It's funny. All right, so you go in
and you grab him.

176
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,565
- Yes.
- You go in...

177
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,307
And I...

178
00:14:58,476 --> 00:14:59,841
And grab him.

179
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:02,605
- What do you do?
- I go in and I grab him.

180
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,577
Piece of pie.

181
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,782
- No, it's "cake."
- What did I say?

182
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,714
- Pie.
- And you said?

183
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,322
- Cake. No, it's pie.
- Piece of pie.

184
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,820
Cake.

185
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:25,334
Mr. White, how's that implant
treating you?

186
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,129
Okay.

187
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:34,142
So how are you? How you doing?
You're looking topnotch. Very stellar.

188
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,576
That's a nice sweater.
A burnt orange or...?

189
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:39,841
Hey, Dr. Oseransky,
your wife's on line one.

190
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:41,644
- Is she upset?
- You know what...

191
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,549
...I can't tell whether she's
laughing or crying.

192
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,383
I think she might be laughing.

193
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:49,082
- Okay, well, put her through, okay, Julie?
- Okay.

194
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,787
Here we go. A little nitrous for you.

195
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:55,125
Now, don't take this off
until I tell you.

196
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,994
You may enjoy that.

197
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:59,259
- Hi, honey, what's up?
- Got some news.

198
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,871
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. We're pregnant.

199
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:05,540
What? We're pregnant!

200
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,509
What? When?

201
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:11,546
- Probably when you were on top of me.
- Or when you were on top of me.

202
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,707
- Doctor.
- Mrs. Himelfarb.

203
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,849
- Don't forget to floss.
- God, Oz, I love you so much.

204
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:19,285
Oh, I love you too. So you're not angry?

205
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:20,788
About me being pregnant?

206
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,552
No, about me almost shooting
a scout this morning.

207
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:25,252
Mrs. Havacamp.

208
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:28,364
- Forget that. I wanna see you.
- Oh, I wanna see you too.

209
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:33,095
I gotta go. So I'll meet you at your
favorite place. Okay, I love you.

210
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:36,767
Mr. White.

211
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,636
I'm so sorry.

212
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:48,349
I'm gonna bring somebody in
to do that for me. Okay?

213
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:55,988
He's not breathing. Call whoever deals with
that. I'm going to lunch with Cynthia.

214
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,223
91 1. 91 1 deals with that.

215
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,561
Call 91... Hold on, please.

216
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,732
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

217
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,510
This can't be good.

218
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:22,414
- It really is perfect now, isn't it?
- Yes.

219
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,452
- There's so much planning.
- I know.

220
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:26,419
So many things to buy.

221
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:28,320
We gotta get a crib, clothes.

222
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:32,622
- We have to redecorate the guest bedroom.
- I'll finally get to build that moat.

223
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:34,094
- What?
- Oh, no worries.

224
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,062
I've already checked with zoning.

225
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:39,566
Are you kidding? We're not building
a fricking moat in our yard.

226
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,864
This will go all around the perimeter.

227
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,770
- Oz, no. Don't ruin this moment.
- I'm not...

228
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:49,037
We're having a baby. Not now.
I mean, we're fighting now...

229
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,113
...but then we're gonna have a baby.

230
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:55,941
- Honey, I'm just trying to...
- Drive me insane.

231
00:17:57,555 --> 00:18:01,855
Look, I don't wanna raise a child in an
environment of complete and total fear.

232
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:05,462
Fear? Who's talking about fear?
We're talking about a moat.

233
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,963
Just think of it as a
little, round swimming pool.

234
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:12,000
- You're afraid of everything, Oz.
- That is so not true.

235
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:29,911
- Thinking about me?
- Off and on. Yeah.

236
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:31,952
See the paper? Well?

237
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:36,059
- I'm a little nervous about this.
- There's nothing to be nervous about.

238
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:39,219
- What, is he driving you nuts again?
- Yes.

239
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,263
Sounds like you could use
a break. A little...

240
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,162
- Cahooting?
- I seem to remember...

241
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,496
...you were always good at cahooting.

242
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,770
I remember a time when your
middle name was danger.

243
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,499
Oh, Jimmy.

244
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,043
- Cynthia.
- I hate lying to Oz like this.

245
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:57,840
Oz can't know anything
about this. Are we clear?

246
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:00,279
We're clear. Does Jill suspect anything?

247
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:03,818
- Jill thinks I'm losing my mind.
- She's probably right.

248
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:07,388
- You still got the numbers, right?
- Of course.

249
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,718
- God.
- What?

250
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:15,024
You still sound so sexy on the phone.

251
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,463
- Listen, one more thing.
- Yeah?

252
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,500
What are you wearing?

253
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,568
It's not important.

254
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:27,507
All right, I gotta go.

255
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,475
- Game time.
- Good luck.

256
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:31,613
You're on.

257
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:46,891
"Honey, I'm sorry."

258
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,624
"Honey, I'm sorry."

259
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:55,367
Honey. I'm so sorry.

260
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,633
It's the idiot from under the table.

261
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,673
Honey?

262
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,871
Honey.

263
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,847
She not here.

264
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,019
Oh, my God.

265
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,892
Mr. White, what are you doing here?

266
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,895
If this is about the nitrous oxide
I gave you, I'm sorry.

267
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,092
Dentist, sit down.

268
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:28,204
Where... Where is my wife?

269
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:30,135
Your wife...

270
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,878
...is in a safe...
- My wife's in a safe?

271
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,842
Place. Safe place.

272
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:40,575
Let me finish a sentence.
I talk, you talk, I talk.

273
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:44,847
- That's how we should have a conversation.
- Okay, yes, good. Whatever you say.

274
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:49,925
How safe and for how long
is entirely up to you.

275
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:54,495
Would it be out of line
if I asked at this juncture...

276
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:58,027
...who you are and what
you're doing in my home?

277
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:12,607
I'm...

278
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:16,116
...flabbergasted.

279
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,752
- I'm sorry...
- Chagrined.

280
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:26,321
That you don't see the similarity
in the facial structure.

281
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:32,865
- And you guys just understand all of this?
- Do you remember Janni Gogolak?

282
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:42,172
Do you or don't you?

283
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:45,943
- What?
- Remember Janni!

284
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:49,775
- Yes, I remember Janni.
- Janni...

285
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,049
...was my son.

286
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,888
Oh, no, no. No, no, I know
what you're thinking.

287
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:00,792
- Yes, you do?
- I think I do.

288
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,160
You're like the Amazing Kreskin.

289
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:06,030
Well, you know all this, where it's going?

290
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:08,694
No, no, no, no. I just think...

291
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:16,371
I think that you think I killed
your son. I did not kill your son.

292
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,641
- Jimmy Tudeski killed your son.
- You know, I collect these.

293
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:22,885
- Really?
- Nope.

294
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,686
- Where is Jimmy?
- Jimmy's dead.

295
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:29,256
- Jimmy's dead. They're both dead.
- I'm bored.

296
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:32,827
Strabo, put one in his head.
Maybe that will help him remember.

297
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,988
- Papa...
- lf he puts one in my head...

298
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:36,632
...how will I remember?
- Shut up!

299
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,462
- I'll try that.
- Where's Jimmy? I know he's alive!

300
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:44,097
Mr. Gogolak, I don't know where Jimmy is.
Please. As far as I know, he's dead.

301
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:46,876
- Strabo.
- Strabo. Don't, Mr. White. Strabo!

302
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:54,948
Enough! Enough!

303
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:58,617
Are you kidding me? That's loud!

304
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:02,290
Come on, he's getting away.

305
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:07,591
Stop, stop. Why are you
shooting in a neighborhood like this?

306
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:11,531
Let everybody know we're here.
Go next door, show them the weapon.

307
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,932
- What are we gonna do, Papa?
- Relax.

308
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:17,562
The dentist will lead us to the rat.

309
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:22,468
It'll be maybe five more minutes.
1 0, maybe.

310
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:24,876
One second.
Dr. Oseranksy's office.

311
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:28,415
- Julie, it's Oz!
- Hey, doc. You sound frazzled.

312
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:31,053
- Are you all right?
- I am frazzled.

313
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:33,621
Just cancel my appointments for the week.

314
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,658
- You know how many people are here?
- Just cancel them!

315
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:39,322
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

316
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:47,666
I got you.

317
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,438
- That was good one.
- Yeah, yeah.

318
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,701
Yermo, Zevo.

319
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:57,904
We're driving to Mexico in 1 0 minutes.

320
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:00,949
Stop drinking or you'll get an IUD.

321
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:04,112
Cynthia, you have something to eat?

322
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,919
Nice of you to take interest in my health.

323
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:11,926
- Cynthia, take one. Eat.
- Thank you, Anya.

324
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,834
Mother, Mother, please, please. No.

325
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:19,833
Not now. It's nice.

326
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:23,469
- It's tough to eat with all the gas.
- I made it for her.

327
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,039
All right.

328
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:31,072
She's 1 08.

329
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,476
I love her.

330
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,712
- Let's get Jimmy! Bring around the car.
- I can't believe you think Jimmy's still alive.

331
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:42,356
You remember how his body was
identified? I do. Dental records.

332
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:46,127
- So?
- Sit down.

333
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:49,924
Your husband just happens
to be a dentist.

334
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,660
He and Jimmy are buddy-buddy.

335
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:55,271
- What's your point?
- Do the math!

336
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:58,897
Jimmy is still alive and
your husband, again, with him.

337
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:02,375
- How do you know where my husband is?
- That was simple.

338
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,207
- "LuJack."
- LuJack?

339
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,178
- In the Porsche.
- No, Papa.

340
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,376
It's... You say "LoJack."

341
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,517
See? LoJack.

342
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,348
- I didn't quite hear.
- Oh, LoJack.

343
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:16,616
Don't correct me.

344
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:18,226
Don't ever correct me!

345
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:21,159
You like getting hit?
You're a freak who enjoys pain?

346
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:23,231
- Of course not.
- Watch the broad!

347
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:30,498
Do you know how this works?

348
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,109
Thanks, I got it.

349
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:38,240
Hold still or you're gonna
look like a Hare Krishna.

350
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,814
That's funny.

351
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,482
- Are you okay?
- Am I bleeding?

352
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:45,554
- No. Hello.
- Jill!

353
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:47,485
- Who's that?
- I can't talk now.

354
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:49,888
Who is that? Give me the phone.
Give me...

355
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,028
Give me the phone.

356
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,825
- Who is this?
- Jimmy. Jimmy, hi, it's Oz.

357
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:59,264
- Oz? How the hell did Oz get our number?
- I don't know.

358
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:01,836
What did I tell you
about ever calling here?

359
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:05,270
I think you said something
about killing me...

360
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:09,845
Yes, killing me and beating me to death
with my own corpse. That's what it was.

361
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,106
Yeah, good memory. What do you want?

362
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:14,443
- I'm in Mexico.
- You're in Mexico?

363
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:16,449
I was thinking I would swing by...

364
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,383
If you come by this house, Oz...

365
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:22,218
...if you come within 25 miles,
I will back a car over your head 75 times.

366
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,461
Okay.

367
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:27,931
Hi, I'm a dead man.

368
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,927
Good talking to you.

369
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:36,201
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Stay away from the vehicle.

370
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,068
Get out of the car. Get out.

371
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:09,465
Jimmy! Jimmy, don't shoot,
it's me, it's Oz!

372
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,335
I know.

373
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,237
That almost hit me.

374
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,447
How you doing?

375
00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:44,096
- Are you wearing bunny slippers?
- Stay away from my chickens, Oz.

376
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:52,137
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Blanche!

377
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,477
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

378
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:56,482
Blanche!

379
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:58,382
- Who's Blanche?
- Consuelo!

380
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:01,888
Xerxes! Alert the others,
there's been a tragedy!

381
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,487
Who's Blanche?

382
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:05,528
This is Blanche.

383
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:07,887
- You killed her.
- I'm sorry.

384
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:12,600
Go home, Oz. Go home before
something bad happens.

385
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:15,966
Something bad already has happened.
Cynthia's been kidnapped.

386
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:19,575
Poor Blanche. Cut down in her prime.

387
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:22,769
He names his chickens.
You name your chickens?

388
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:28,077
Blanche! You're dead!

389
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:42,230
Hey, Oz, you're here.

390
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,132
He killed Blanche.

391
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:48,738
- What are you doing here?
- I'd like to know. What are you doing here?

392
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:51,430
- Put a sock in it. We talk all the time.
- Jill.

393
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,371
Really. You talk all the time?

394
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:57,639
We spoke once. And I think it was mostly
about some kind of fruit.

395
00:28:57,814 --> 00:28:59,076
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

396
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,648
- You weren't followed?
- No.

397
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:03,047
- How would you know?
- Honey.

398
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:07,121
Well, now that he's here, he's staying
for lobster â la Tudeski.

399
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,749
"Lobster â la Tudeski"? I can't stay
for lobster â la Tudeski.

400
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:13,623
- Lazlo Gogolak was at my house.
- Oh, my God.

401
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:16,288
- Am I setting a place or not?
- Yes, please.

402
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:19,833
- What is the matter with him?
- It's a long story. Talk to me.

403
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:21,732
Well, Cynthia's been kidnapped.

404
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:23,133
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

405
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:26,936
- Lazlo wants Jimmy's head for killing Janni.
- He came to your house?

406
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,979
Wouldn't this conversation be so much
better dining on my masterpiece?

407
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:34,180
What's wrong with him?

408
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,649
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

409
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,447
They know you're alive.

410
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:40,385
- How would they know?
- They do.

411
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:43,151
Oh, look, honey, we have
a squealer in the house.

412
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:45,318
A squealer? I'm not a squealer!

413
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,426
I've never squealed on anybody.

414
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:48,859
How do they know, Oz?

415
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:51,364
They have Cynthia. I need your help.

416
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,160
- Yeah.
- And I'm your friend.

417
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:57,234
You know what, Oz?
Friendship is overrated.

418
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:01,366
I got enough friends. In fact, I'm thinking
about maybe losing a couple.

419
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,713
This could be great. A way
to get back in the game.

420
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:09,215
Yes, back in the game.

421
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:12,321
I don't wish to get back in the game.
I like cooking.

422
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,889
I like cleaning. And I like to decorate.

423
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:19,694
- We're talking about Cynthia here.
- Yes, Cynthia. Your ex-wife?

424
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:22,491
"Ex" would be the key word
in that sentence, Oz.

425
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:25,430
If you don't get off your ass
and help get Cynthia...

426
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:27,399
...I'll never talk to you again.

427
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:31,302
If you ever grab me like that again,
I will stick a knife in your face.

428
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:32,908
Is that clear?

429
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:35,340
We'll talk about it over dinner...

430
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:38,379
...which is probably ruined.
Go wash your hands.

431
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:39,879
We eat in 1 5 minutes.

432
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:45,819
He's kidding.

433
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,914
You better go wash your hands, Oz.

434
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:09,670
Well, it really is a nice presentation.

435
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:12,781
It would have been,
if we hadn't let the sauce clot.

436
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:18,749
The potatoes were supposed to be floating
around the lobster, not just stuck like that.

437
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:20,890
I had this tricolore thing going on.

438
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:22,285
It looks great.

439
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:26,088
I would hate to think you were
placating me to talk about Cynthia.

440
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:28,757
No. No.

441
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,235
- Is that Hebrew?
- Yeah.

442
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:37,202
- Aren't you Catholic?
- Yeah. Devout.

443
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,475
- That makes sense.
- Oz...

444
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:41,838
...give us the lowdown on Cynthia.

445
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:43,445
She's pregnant.

446
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:46,081
Oh, my God! That's so great!

447
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:48,740
Thanks. The funny thing is,
we weren't trying.

448
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:51,050
Oh, my God, that's great.

449
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:55,753
- Any idea where they're keeping her?
- With Lazlo. What's the matter with him?

450
00:31:56,393 --> 00:32:00,261
Nothing, don't worry. This is just
his way of expressing joy lately.

451
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,499
Oh, so this is how a
retired mass murderer acts.

452
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:08,297
This is how a retired mass murderer behaves
when people show up uninvited for dinner!

453
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:10,463
- Noted.
- Jimmy.

454
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:19,245
- How many goons does he have with him?
- Seven, eight.

455
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:21,275
- And his son.
- Strabonitz?

456
00:32:23,653 --> 00:32:25,814
Well, should I go to the police?

457
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,549
Kidnapping would put him away forever.

458
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:32,092
He'd make her disappear to avoid
going back to the slammer.

459
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:33,695
Why are you asking me?

460
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:36,492
- This is Oz's problem.
- Jimmy.

461
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,190
You have to help me.

462
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:41,667
What, are you nuts? I got
a great thing going on down here, Oz.

463
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:43,533
Plus, I'm safe down here.

464
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:46,733
Besides, I don't care what happens
with you and Cynthia.

465
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,674
I'm not uprooting my life
to save your sorry ass.

466
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,547
Light it up like a piñata!

467
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,652
You told them where I live?
You're dead.

468
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:01,154
Told them where I live.
You're a dead man.

469
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:13,801
- Jimmy, are you coming or not?!
- You can run, but you can't hide!

470
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:17,169
Let's go!

471
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:20,537
Oz! Oz.

472
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:23,777
Put the...
Let's go!

473
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:27,582
You better run, tooth-boy.

474
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:30,481
I get a second, I'm gonna slice you up.

475
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:33,555
Anyone hit anything yet?

476
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,884
Let's go.

477
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,903
Will you come on?

478
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:51,104
This idiot. Will you come on?

479
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,502
Get up!

480
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:57,713
Go!

481
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:04,049
They're getting away!

482
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,314
Come on!

483
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:15,128
You're shooting at the house,
they're in the car. You had one shot.

484
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,800
All right, it was a nice shot.
It was. Come here.

485
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,233
It was a nice shot.

486
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,940
Nice shooting, honey.

487
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,807
Thanks, honey.

488
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,845
The sons of batches got away.

489
00:34:34,384 --> 00:34:37,012
So do I clip her or not?

490
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:41,351
Keep Cynthia happy for the time being.
Can you do that?

491
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:43,687
Not likely.

492
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:51,796
Sick bastards!

493
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:58,297
What?! What is it? What?

494
00:35:00,844 --> 00:35:02,311
Janni.

495
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:04,913
I want him dead.

496
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,012
Dead!

497
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:10,411
Yesterday!

498
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:12,782
Before breakfast!

499
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,618
Before eggs!

500
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:18,988
Scrambled.

501
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,797
I don't understand why
we have to dump my car.

502
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:32,669
It's not your business
to understand.

503
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:35,709
It's not my business to leave
my $80,000 car in Mexico.

504
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:39,076
Maybe you got a plan there.
Take the car, lose the wife.

505
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:41,012
- Good plan.
- I'll get the tickets.

506
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,811
You do that, you squealer.

507
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:46,683
- I didn't squeal on anybody.
- The Gogolaks showed up on their own?

508
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:50,292
- Forget it, Jill.
- It means he's a rat and a liar.

509
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,020
You married someone in the
witness protection program.

510
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,126
You got a really funny way...

511
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:58,165
...of asking for help, squeal cheese!

512
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:01,364
- Please help me?
- Well, that's a little better.

513
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:05,165
But it still doesn't help, now that
the bad guys know where I live.

514
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:10,506
- You're spitting in my mouth.
- Just go and get the tickets, squeal weasel!

515
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:14,246
- How was that?
- It was good.

516
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,977
- Scary.
- Really?

517
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:18,984
Come here.

518
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:40,337
So, Oz, congratulations
on Cynthia being pregnant.

519
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,375
Thank you.

520
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:48,840
You think I'd be a good father?

521
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:52,719
- You don't think I'd be a good father?
- I didn't say that.

522
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:54,151
You didn't say anything.

523
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:56,724
No, I think you'd be a good father.

524
00:36:56,893 --> 00:37:00,021
- I didn't understand what you were...
- Shut up.

525
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:04,223
- Why are we on this bus?
- Your car's got a GPS system on it.

526
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,198
I figure that's how Lazlo
tracked you down.

527
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,396
- That's what I'm hoping, for your sake.
- For my sake?

528
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:13,167
Yeah. Because if that's not the case...

529
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,038
...I'm gonna kill you.

530
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:18,078
- Right, baby?
- Yes, sirree, Bob.

531
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:22,650
- I wish Cynthia got kidnapped more often.
- Me too.

532
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:29,285
I'll just put my wife in danger whenever
you guys have problems in the bedroom.

533
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,620
What problems? What problems?

534
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:33,455
I didn't say anything.

535
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,963
Is this what you two talk about
on the phone behind my back?

536
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:41,369
How would you like it if I talked to Cynthia
behind your back? Sit down.

537
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:44,701
- You're causing a scene.
- You grabbed my face.

538
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:47,936
The front part of my head.

539
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,183
Yes?

540
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:01,585
He bought three one-way tickets to L.A.

541
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:05,023
Los Angeles? Interesting.

542
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:08,028
All right, so we cut them off at the piss.

543
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,725
Just like John Wayne,
we ride up over the hill.

544
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:14,302
You two in the Porsche. All right?

545
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,998
When we get to L.A., we strip it,
make a few dollars and then torch it.

546
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:23,373
But for now, you hot-wire it
and follow us. All right? Come on.

547
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,049
- Can we stop the horseplay for one second?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

548
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:42,560
Okay, so we had a car. My car.
My $80,000 car.

549
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:46,065
Then we're on a bus.
And now we're renting a car.

550
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:47,703
This doesn't make any sense.

551
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:49,202
- It will.
- I ordered...

552
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:53,308
...a black cup of coffee, all right?
A black cup of coffee.

553
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:55,137
I screwed up. I apologize.

554
00:38:55,311 --> 00:39:00,146
Well, do I have to wait another 20 minutes
for your screwup? A black cup of coffee.

555
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:03,114
- I'll get a fresh cup.
- You're still standing there.

556
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,753
- You're still standing.
- I apologize.

557
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,183
Bye.

558
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,289
Hey, pal?

559
00:39:10,894 --> 00:39:14,455
Why don't you give the girl a break.
She already said she was sorry.

560
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:17,930
- She's just working for a living.
- Right.

561
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:21,502
Why don't you mind your own business.

562
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,201
- Asshole.
- Oh, no.

563
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,946
Where was I?
I was just gonna remind you...

564
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:45,759
Now, son, you're never gonna be
as mean or rude...

565
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:50,628
...to a waitress or anybody that brings you
food like your dad just was, are you, son?

566
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,291
- No.
- Real good.

567
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:57,269
Eat all your corn. Grow up to be big
and strong like your Uncle Jimmy.

568
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:01,332
You see, Oz? I'd be a great father.

569
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:04,947
I just taught that kid
not to be mean to waitresses.

570
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:13,019
You know, we could
make this a real party.

571
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:17,182
- What, we need more balloons?
- Oh, Strabo.

572
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,419
I love your name.

573
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:23,126
No, Strabo, I mean, you and me...

574
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,733
...well, we could make this, you know...

575
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,426
...a fun party.

576
00:40:27,603 --> 00:40:31,835
- Oh, you mean you and me...
- That's right.

577
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,807
- I've always had a little crush on you.
- I've always sensed that.

578
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:38,573
- You did?
- Yes.

579
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:44,380
- I guess Jimmy just moved a little quicker?
- Well, Jimmy is as good as...

580
00:40:44,554 --> 00:40:46,351
And so you and the dentist...

581
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:49,582
Things not so well going?

582
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:51,818
To tell you the truth...

583
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:55,161
...I kind of miss the excitement.

584
00:40:56,966 --> 00:41:00,766
And I like your hair that way.

585
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:03,531
- Long.
- You're making me blush.

586
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:06,106
That's good.

587
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:13,379
Give me one good reason to trust you.

588
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:16,347
- Well, I can give 280 million.
- What?

589
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:19,955
- What are you talking about?
- Your father never told you?

590
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:21,647
What?

591
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:23,758
What's so funny?

592
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,885
What's so goddamn funny?

593
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,388
Strabo.

594
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:31,556
Your daddy thinks you're a moron.

595
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:36,637
- Anya!
- Coming.

596
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:39,707
Anya, you watch the broad.

597
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:42,367
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the bus station.

598
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:44,740
- Find Papa.
- My God.

599
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,219
Anya, can I use your bathroom?

600
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:00,760
Yes.

601
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:07,766
All right, I got your cream cheese
and scrambled egg.

602
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:11,872
- That leaves you with the tuna.
- I don't like tuna.

603
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,169
- Start liking it.
- Okay.

604
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:18,469
I thought of a reason
why you don't have to kill me.

605
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:20,138
What would that be, dentist?

606
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:24,184
What if they didn't trace me through my car?
That's a hell of a thing to hang my life on.

607
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:27,811
- Only thing to hang your life on is trust.
- You want mustard?

608
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,548
Yes, honey, thank you.

609
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:36,957
What, no Jewish prayer
before our ham and cheese?

610
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:39,931
You got a problem
with my religiosity, Oz?

611
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:43,829
Do unto others before you're
turned into a pillar of salt.

612
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:46,099
Exactly. Unless they're a rat.

613
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,641
Then you can shoot them in the eyes.

614
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:51,803
- A pillar of salt?
- That's right. Moses said that.

615
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,539
Read the Bible, Oz.

616
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:57,781
Eat up, dentist.
It could be your last meal.

617
00:42:57,954 --> 00:43:00,980
If they don't show up,
you're gonna shoot me? Is that it?

618
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:03,682
- That's the size of it.
- And let Cynthia die too?

619
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,954
I told you before, I don't care
what happens to Cynthia.

620
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,362
Oh, yeah, sure. That's why you're still
wearing her crucifix around your neck.

621
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,468
No, wait. I'm sorry, what?

622
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:17,003
- What did you say was Cynthia's?
- Did I say something?

623
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:22,840
Two years we've been together
and you never mention...

624
00:43:23,012 --> 00:43:26,413
...you wear a present from your ex-wife?
- It wasn't a present.

625
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:28,345
- Where's it from?
- I don't know.

626
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:32,648
It's Cynthia's. Her grandmother gave it
to her and she gave it to Jimmy.

627
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:35,290
You say you're not a squealer?!

628
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:40,921
Looks like you got a reprieve, Oz.

629
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,992
Oh, thank God the killers are here.

630
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,701
So check the bus?

631
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:53,967
As opposed to...

632
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,612
...just looking at the bus?
Yes, check the bus!

633
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:02,215
Let me out of here. Hey!

634
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,221
Let me out of here.

635
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,766
Come on. Open the door.

636
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:30,708
Perfect. Right on time.

637
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,405
Your wife's as good as home, Oz.

638
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:37,750
I know you're in here.

639
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,134
- Looking for me, Strabo?
- Oh, shit.

640
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:06,714
Anything tricky, I blow your ribs
across the parking lot. Let's go.

641
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:09,043
- The rat's not here.
- Not here.

642
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:11,118
The Jimmy...

643
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:16,254
...is watching me right now. I can feel it.

644
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:20,521
Hey, Lazlo.

645
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:23,631
- No, no, no.
- Look what I got.

646
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:27,235
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- Man, did you get old.

647
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:32,397
- I like the whole Liberace thing, though.
- How long you think you can hide from me?

648
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:34,600
Where are you going with this?

649
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:38,406
I'll call you to tell you where we'll
make the exchange with Cynthia.

650
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:42,483
Any of your knuckleheads follow this car,
I start throwing out body parts.

651
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:44,483
Feet first.

652
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:46,121
You harm...

653
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:49,486
...one hair on his head...

654
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:52,927
If they have Strabo, who has girl?

655
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:01,066
Answer. Answer, Mother.

656
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:23,621
You okay, darling?

657
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:32,461
- What's up, Jill?
- Nothing.

658
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,700
Open the trunk.
Don't even think about it.

659
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:46,708
Thank you.

660
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,445
- I think you nicked his head there.
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

661
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,645
- What is your problem, Jill?
- Nothing.

662
00:46:53,823 --> 00:46:56,383
- I don't have a problem.
- Good.

663
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:59,255
Why don't you go and check us in.

664
00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:01,521
Okay.

665
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:08,227
I wouldn't mind you wearing it,
it's just so ugly.

666
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:10,428
- Just throw it away.
- I can't.

667
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:13,370
- You still have feelings for her?
- It's sacrilegious.

668
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:17,740
- Why not give it back to her?
- I haven't seen her since my nickel in Joliet!

669
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:20,909
Where does he get sayings like that?

670
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:24,219
We aren't gonna talk much, are we?

671
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:27,049
There is something
really wrong with you, Jill.

672
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:30,488
- You're still in love with her.
- That's insane. Isn't it?

673
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:38,491
- Why don't you let me take it...
- Tell you what:

674
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,830
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
- I love you, Jill.

675
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:45,838
But if you touch this crucifix,
I'll kill you. That's a promise.

676
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:49,543
This is my good luck charm.

677
00:47:50,446 --> 00:47:52,539
I take it off, I'm jinxed.

678
00:47:52,715 --> 00:47:54,546
Wanna see me dead, Jill?

679
00:47:56,218 --> 00:47:57,810
Do you?

680
00:47:58,154 --> 00:48:00,554
Sometimes, yeah.

681
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:07,089
- I'm going to check in.
- Can you believe this?

682
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:12,326
- Well, 47 percent of couples at some point...
- You know, you've got a very long face.

683
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:14,366
Like a goldfish...

684
00:48:14,537 --> 00:48:17,665
...or a Shetland pony or something.
- Bring Strabo, Oz.

685
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:20,735
I gotta have you...

686
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:35,488
Where is she?

687
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:39,717
Look, how nice. Everybody is still here...

688
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:43,092
...having a little repast. Isn't that lovely?

689
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,494
Where else would I be?

690
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:47,695
I don't know.

691
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,498
One would venture a guess.

692
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:54,769
A question could be asked:
Where have you been?

693
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:57,776
Big loft, very drafty. I understand.

694
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:00,914
Get me Figueroa on the phone!

695
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,244
Mr. G., Frankie Figs is dead.

696
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:08,655
How sad for him.
Try calling the one who's still alive!

697
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:19,166
Jill. Come on, open the door.

698
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:20,825
Jill!

699
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:25,330
Jill, will you come on? Be sensible.

700
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:27,567
Apologize.

701
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,777
Jill, honey, I'm sorry
I pointed a gun at your face...

702
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:34,575
...and said I was gonna
blow your brains out.

703
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,945
Okay? I didn't mean that.

704
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,850
- Come on, knock it off.
- I will when you get rid of that crucifix.

705
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:43,992
This cross represents my Lord and Savior.

706
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,320
The baby in the manger.
I throw it away...

707
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,794
...I go to hell!
- Coming from a man who's killed 21 people.

708
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,991
- Twenty-one? That's impressive.
- It is, isn't it?

709
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:57,764
Two years, I've been begging you to go
back to work. Cynthia gets kidnapped...

710
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,067
...you're off to the races!

711
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:05,945
Off to the races?

712
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:08,947
"Apologize, then she'll come right out."

713
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:11,885
Squeal bag! Squealster!

714
00:50:12,224 --> 00:50:14,283
Remington Squeal!

715
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,226
See what you got me into? Get over here
and you help me out of this jam.

716
00:50:18,397 --> 00:50:20,456
You better make it good.

717
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,994
Snoodster? Hon?

718
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:26,729
You're gonna be hearing
from somebody else now.

719
00:50:26,905 --> 00:50:28,998
Jill? Scooster?

720
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:31,142
Snoodster.

721
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:36,107
I think you're being a little unreasonable.
When he pulled a gun on you...

722
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:38,545
...that was pretty funny.

723
00:50:38,717 --> 00:50:40,912
Oz, nobody's talking to you.

724
00:50:41,086 --> 00:50:43,646
Hey, you take it easy on Oz, okay?
He's a doctor.

725
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:48,350
- People see him when they have problems.
- People see him when they have plaque.

726
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,386
- He's a wonderful dentist.
- Pipe it, toughie.

727
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:56,125
I promise I'll shoot you. Frankly, I don't care
whether we get Cynthia back or not.

728
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:58,360
Well, that's a bad...

729
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:01,806
- Oh, trouble in the bedroom?
- What'd you just say?

730
00:51:01,974 --> 00:51:04,272
- Nothing.
- Excuse me, please.

731
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:08,708
Did you tell him that?!
Did you tell him that, Jill?!

732
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:13,012
A few moments of erectile dysfunction...
Just a few, really.

733
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:16,177
- And I'm not a man now? Is that it?
- Stop kicking.

734
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:18,721
If you didn't love her, you'd take it off.

735
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:22,684
- Is that it?!
- Excuse me.

736
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:25,887
Can we please call Lazlo
and make the switch for Cynthia?

737
00:51:26,065 --> 00:51:28,124
No. I'll tell you why we can't do that!

738
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:33,237
Because that would involve me talking to
my wife, which I am never gonna do again!

739
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:35,236
I'm going to get drunk.

740
00:51:39,411 --> 00:51:41,811
- You believe this?
- Well, erectile dysfunc...

741
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,574
Shut up. I'm gonna
go get Jimmy. Will you...

742
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,878
...watch Strabo for a while?
- Eat shit.

743
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:51,022
How can he get drunk at a time like this?

744
00:51:55,894 --> 00:52:00,763
Maybe this whole "erectile misfiring"
is God's way of punishing me.

745
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,060
He sees all things great and small.

746
00:52:03,235 --> 00:52:07,194
You know, I've done
some very bad things. I lie to Jill.

747
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:09,738
I don't take the trash out.

748
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:13,069
- I killed 21 people.
- Actually, 22.

749
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:14,906
- Who'd I forget?
- Frankie Figs.

750
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:22,943
This is it. This is the reason that God
does not want me to father a child.

751
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:26,888
He does not want me to spread my seed.

752
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:31,958
God is counting my seed, Oz.
He's probably up in heaven right now...

753
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:36,693
...counting my little seeds. 1 38, 1 39...

754
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:39,861
...1 40...
- Stop, stop! Stop counting your seed.

755
00:52:40,038 --> 00:52:43,599
I don't think God is keeping an eye
on your sperm.

756
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:47,872
What kind of a job is that for God?
It'd take him all day. I'm gonna throw up.

757
00:52:48,046 --> 00:52:50,879
Fine. Throw up.
Go ahead, you have your fun.

758
00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:53,916
- What about me?
- Why don't you just consider adopting?

759
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:55,747
Come on, Oz.

760
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:59,880
How many adoption agencies
are gonna give a kid to a professional killer?

761
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:03,687
- You may have a point there.
- Maybe I could just steal a kid.

762
00:53:03,862 --> 00:53:06,092
They're small. How hard can that be?

763
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:08,597
That's the thinking
you gotta get away from.

764
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:12,066
But I'd be a great father, Oz.
I would. I'd be a great dad.

765
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,432
I'd teach the kid how to play baseball.

766
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:16,801
- I've always been good with a bat.
- True.

767
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:20,706
And, I mean, when I was kid,
I had this cool little slingshot, right?

768
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:24,815
And I could make a slingshot
for my little boy.

769
00:53:24,983 --> 00:53:28,976
And I could teach him how to use it.
And if he couldn't get it right away...

770
00:53:29,154 --> 00:53:33,682
...I'd be patient. I wouldn't yell at him.
I wouldn't make him cry.

771
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,065
Jimmy, there's a lot of people looking.

772
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,205
Things with the husband
not so well going?

773
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:58,473
I was thinking...

774
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:02,984
...if you were to have sex
with another man...

775
00:54:03,155 --> 00:54:05,487
...it would make Jimmy jealous.

776
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,892
Oh, yeah?

777
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,791
- Like with who?
- Well, let's say...

778
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:18,865
...with me, for example.

779
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:27,135
You look good with a gun.

780
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:35,010
Did you have a good relationship
with your father, Oz?

781
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:37,815
- We were like pals.
- Like to kill my father.

782
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:41,050
Like to take an ice pick
and stick it right in his eyeball.

783
00:54:41,226 --> 00:54:43,251
Still wanna throw up.

784
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,830
Can you help me?
Can you tell me? I mean, what the...?

785
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:49,263
What the hell is going on here?!

786
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:53,268
Why are we all on this big,
spinning ball that we call Earth?!

787
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:56,373
Why? Why?

788
00:54:56,875 --> 00:55:00,538
You ever hear of avoidance behavior?
I don't wanna talk about that...

789
00:55:00,712 --> 00:55:04,204
Let's talk about avoidance behavior.
Like sitting here in a bar...

790
00:55:04,383 --> 00:55:08,012
...drinking shots instead of saving Cynthia?
- She'll be fine, Oz.

791
00:55:08,186 --> 00:55:10,677
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you one thing:

792
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:14,383
I am not gonna go out there
and risk my ass for my wife...

793
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,720
- My wife!
- Whatever!

794
00:55:16,895 --> 00:55:19,762
I'm not risking my ass before I get
a few things off my chest.

795
00:55:19,932 --> 00:55:23,129
Fine. Say them. What do you wanna say?

796
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:29,170
- You know I was a bed wetter?
- You don't do it anymore, do you?

797
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:31,400
At 1 2, I saw my dad
naked in the shower.

798
00:55:31,576 --> 00:55:35,672
Well, that's probably why you wet the bed.
Very Freudian. Jungian.

799
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:38,475
- We had some great times.
- You and your father?

800
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,311
No! Me and Cynthia!

801
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:45,054
- That's almost vomit.
- What was it like when Cynthia told you...

802
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:48,989
...she was pregnant?
- Oh, well, that was a beautiful moment.

803
00:55:50,696 --> 00:55:53,631
- She's got a great rack, doesn't she?
- I'm sorry?

804
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:55,664
I mean, she was so wild.

805
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:58,359
So wild. I mean...

806
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:01,938
...one time we wrecked
an entire suite at the Hotel Drake.

807
00:56:02,107 --> 00:56:06,669
- Seven thousand dollars' worth of damage.
- Let's stop talking about you and my wife.

808
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:10,178
I mean, we didn't
come out of the room for four days.

809
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:12,579
But I don't gotta tell you, do I?

810
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:15,948
You're married to her,
you lucky son of a bitch.

811
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:19,190
- What is this thing?
- What we've been building.

812
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:20,689
- Get it out of here!
- Why?

813
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:23,851
Because I hate it!
It makes me sad.

814
00:56:26,865 --> 00:56:28,696
What's happening?

815
00:56:28,867 --> 00:56:31,631
What's happening now?
Where are you going now?

816
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,804
Check.

817
00:57:01,066 --> 00:57:02,863
Good morning...

818
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:17,610
What the hell is this?

819
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:20,946
Just give me five more minutes, baby.

820
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:31,089
You are really noisy in the morning.

821
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:34,624
Jimmy, what the hell happened
last night?

822
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:38,766
And why does my ass hurt?

823
00:57:39,337 --> 00:57:43,433
- You fell down the stairs.
- Oh, good. So nothing happened.

824
00:57:43,608 --> 00:57:46,771
Of course not. Not really.

825
00:57:47,612 --> 00:57:50,479
- What does that mean?
- We were just a couple of guys...

826
00:57:50,649 --> 00:57:54,642
...helping each other out. That's all.
- I'm sorry, but what does that mean?

827
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,880
It was a really magical night, Oz.
Don't ruin it.

828
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:01,158
- What is it now?
- That thing.

829
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:03,351
- Oh, this?
- I knew it.

830
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:06,497
- Oh, my God.
- You guys enjoy your slumber party?

831
00:58:06,665 --> 00:58:09,327
This is not what it looks like. Right?

832
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:11,731
- Where's Strabo?
- He got away.

833
00:58:13,338 --> 00:58:17,206
- I'm kidding. He's right here.
- Okay, well, I'm gonna put some clothes on.

834
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,900
- You want some help?
- I think I'm fine. Thank...

835
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:26,717
- A little male bonding?
- Just like C block, huh, Strabo?

836
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:29,479
I fell down the stairs, Strabo.

837
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:32,116
Going out to get some coffee.

838
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:36,793
I should probably
put some clothes on first.

839
00:58:36,962 --> 00:58:38,293
Yeah.

840
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:55,074
- Hey, Oz, can you come in here for a sec?
- Yes.

841
00:58:58,016 --> 00:59:00,484
Listen, that was not what you...

842
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:03,086
Let me close that.

843
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:06,948
Why are you bottomless?

844
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,355
I hated that skirt.

845
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:16,699
- You don't like that shirt too?
- Came with the skirt.

846
00:59:16,868 --> 00:59:19,200
I see. I mean, I really see.

847
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:30,280
What are you doing?

848
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:36,687
Oz.

849
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:39,687
You like my perfume? Smell it.

850
00:59:41,193 --> 00:59:45,095
- I've been a little stuffed up, feeling nasally.
- Smell it.

851
00:59:47,866 --> 00:59:51,029
Yes. Yes, I do.
It's...

852
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,832
You like my bra?

853
00:59:57,108 --> 01:00:00,600
This... Here it is. It's a purple shirt.

854
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,882
- Give me your hand.
- What are you gonna do...

855
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,678
Give it!

856
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:12,086
Feel my heart.

857
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:14,224
I don't think that's your heart.

858
01:00:14,392 --> 01:00:18,385
Isn't your heart in between all that?

859
01:00:18,563 --> 01:00:21,054
My heart is broken.

860
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:23,596
Can you feel that?

861
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,401
Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I...

862
01:00:31,776 --> 01:00:34,472
It's so broken, Oz!

863
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:36,671
- Jill!
- Oz!

864
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:39,908
- I'm so sad. Oz!
- Don't be sad.

865
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,677
What's all this?

866
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:47,781
First my ex-wife and now my wife-wife.

867
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:50,223
No, no, no. She just hated her outfit.

868
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,992
- He wants to talk to you for a second.
- No, you.

869
01:01:06,044 --> 01:01:09,104
I've been waiting a long time for this, Oz.

870
01:01:09,347 --> 01:01:13,647
Oz? I think Oz is gonna be out
for a good half-hour, 45 minutes, Jill.

871
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:18,919
I didn't... I just...

872
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:22,324
Jimmy, I...

873
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:29,323
You do love me, don't you?

874
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:48,515
Up on your toes. Stand up.
Come on, tippy-time, tippy-time.

875
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:51,451
- Why can't I stay in here?
- There you go. Sit down.

876
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:53,989
Read a nice book.

877
01:01:58,897 --> 01:02:00,728
Oh, God!

878
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:03,333
- Yeah, baby!
- That feels so good!

879
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:06,265
She just hated her outfit.

880
01:02:07,339 --> 01:02:09,807
Yippee ki-yay!

881
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:20,174
Yeah!

882
01:02:22,454 --> 01:02:24,854
You believe I fell down the stairs, right?

883
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,253
What stairs?

884
01:02:52,317 --> 01:02:54,649
- Hello?
- Bring me the phone.

885
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:57,686
- Put Liberace on.
- Is this who I think is this?

886
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:01,257
- Back from the dead?
- Yeah, Lazlo, skip the formalities.

887
01:03:01,426 --> 01:03:04,691
Call you at 2:00 and tell you
where we'll make the exchange.

888
01:03:04,863 --> 01:03:09,232
Well, it better be 2 on the dot
or I start cutting off the batch's fingers...

889
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:12,097
...one at a time! Wouldn't that be nice...

890
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,500
...to get little pieces of the girl?

891
01:03:14,672 --> 01:03:16,663
One, two, three...

892
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:19,503
...little tiny pieces.
- Drop dead.

893
01:03:19,944 --> 01:03:21,912
- What'd he say?
- He said hi.

894
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:25,013
- We'll need more firepower.
- I got guns. All you need.

895
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,708
Oz, you stud.

896
01:03:47,605 --> 01:03:51,735
- Here they are. What do you think?
- Oh, my God!

897
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:55,573
- Oh, my God, you have an H and K MP5K.
- Can we hurry? It's almost 2.

898
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:58,272
We're gonna be fine.
Oh, wait, can I see this?

899
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,850
- Allow me. I got it.
- Okay.

900
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:03,749
Gotta be careful with these things.

901
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:10,084
I got it.

902
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,865
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, topnotch.

903
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,839
It's almost 2. We've gotta
load them up and move them out.

904
01:04:25,009 --> 01:04:27,443
- Don't screw around.
- Careful.

905
01:04:27,612 --> 01:04:29,102
- All right.
- There.

906
01:04:34,052 --> 01:04:35,485
I got it. I got it.

907
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:40,553
Hold on, Oz.

908
01:04:56,808 --> 01:04:59,641
Would you be careful of the fixtures?

909
01:05:03,448 --> 01:05:05,814
I hurt the side part of my head.

910
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:11,050
Nice guns. Put them in the back seat.

911
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:15,059
You made her carry all the guns, Oz?

912
01:05:15,393 --> 01:05:18,362
Okay, can we call Lazlo? It's after 2.

913
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:21,896
Jimmy, you're late.

914
01:05:22,066 --> 01:05:24,000
Bring Cynthia to the Beverly Center.

915
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:27,632
- Meet at the food court in an hour.
- I wanna talk to my son.

916
01:05:27,805 --> 01:05:30,399
You're gonna have to
hold on a minute.

917
01:05:31,075 --> 01:05:32,770
- Go get Strabo.
- I'll get Strabo.

918
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:35,003
- I just said that.
- Right.

919
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,107
Go.

920
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:49,022
Strabo.

921
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:51,723
Damn it!

922
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:55,693
I can't find Strabo.
I think he's gone.

923
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,764
- What?
- He's not where we left him.

924
01:05:57,936 --> 01:05:59,460
Hold on.
What do you mean?

925
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:01,036
I'm holding, I'm holding.

926
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:03,105
There's just pieces of wood...

927
01:06:03,274 --> 01:06:05,936
- Where the hell is Strabo, people?
- In the trunk.

928
01:06:08,046 --> 01:06:11,015
Okay. How did Strabo
get in the trunk, Oz?

929
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,746
- I don't know.
- Well, get him out.

930
01:06:17,288 --> 01:06:19,586
- Where are the keys?
- In here, with me.

931
01:06:19,757 --> 01:06:22,055
- It keeps getting better.
- Why's he in the trunk?

932
01:06:22,226 --> 01:06:24,888
I don't know! You were
supposed to be watching him!

933
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:26,325
Tulip!

934
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:28,727
- Hold on, Lazlo.
- All right, you know what?

935
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,767
No more holding.
Put my son on the phone now!

936
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:37,266
- Your son's...
- Strabonitz?

937
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:42,236
- Your son's in the trunk right now.
- The trunk? I wanna talk to my son!

938
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:49,053
Strabo, your father
wants to talk to you.

939
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:53,086
What?

940
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:56,960
- Did you get the gist of that?
- Yes.

941
01:06:57,996 --> 01:07:00,055
You locked my son in the trunk?

942
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:02,927
No, no, sir. No, sir.
He locked himself in there.

943
01:07:06,037 --> 01:07:09,598
This I believe. Fine.
You have a spare key?

944
01:07:09,774 --> 01:07:12,709
- A spare key?
- No. Car Ranch Rentals only gave us one.

945
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:15,778
- Negative on the spare key.
- What about a locksmith?

946
01:07:16,014 --> 01:07:19,142
- Do you know of one in the area?
- It's your town, dentist.

947
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:24,016
You should know where a...
Fine, you know what, Mr. Brain?

948
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:27,151
The trunk release button,
how about that?

949
01:07:27,325 --> 01:07:30,488
Every car since 1 985 has
a trunk release button.

950
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:33,927
Find it, open the trunk
and let my boy out.

951
01:07:34,098 --> 01:07:38,262
There's a button on the driver's side.
Every car since 1 985...

952
01:07:41,973 --> 01:07:44,908
We kill them the moment we
see them. In the head.

953
01:07:45,243 --> 01:07:48,303
- I can't find it.
- What kind of piece of shit car is this?

954
01:07:48,513 --> 01:07:50,845
- Well, Car Ranch Rentals.
- It's a hitter!

955
01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:54,644
- A hitter. Lazlo's got a hitter on us.
- Did you hire a hitter?

956
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:57,879
Did I? I don't remember, really.

957
01:07:58,056 --> 01:08:01,617
- Is someone shooting at you?
- Your hitter is hitting at us!

958
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:05,986
That's bad. My son is there!

959
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:08,792
- Tell the hitter to stop.
- Your boss says to stop.

960
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:11,161
- His son's with us. Stop!
- This is Lazlo.

961
01:08:11,335 --> 01:08:13,997
- Stop shooting!
- That's a direct Hungarian order!

962
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:16,305
Let me find speakerphone.

963
01:08:16,507 --> 01:08:18,702
- Cease fire!
- What's going on? Talk to me.

964
01:08:18,876 --> 01:08:21,174
He's not listening to you.

965
01:08:22,914 --> 01:08:24,905
Well, you should fire him.

966
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,845
- Are you kidding?
- That was me.

967
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:29,953
- Try not to shoot Oz, honey.
- Yeah.

968
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:37,419
Let's go, kids!

969
01:08:45,603 --> 01:08:47,537
Get up!

970
01:08:49,874 --> 01:08:52,843
You are in no danger.

971
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:56,209
If she moves,
put your cane through her eye.

972
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:15,793
Unbelievable.

973
01:09:17,268 --> 01:09:20,101
- How did you do that?
- Every car since 1 985...

974
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:22,205
...had a little button right here.

975
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,970
All right, come on out of there...

976
01:09:36,888 --> 01:09:39,220
- What is this?
- That's a dead hostage, Oz.

977
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:41,688
- That is what that is.
- That can't be good.

978
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:43,793
No, you're right. That's not good.

979
01:09:43,995 --> 01:09:47,761
It looks like he got shot in the foot.
Who dies from a shot in the foot?

980
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:50,526
He probably got shot when
the hitter was shooting.

981
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:53,397
That's really great. Well done, Jill.

982
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:55,436
Hey, look, shit happens.

983
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:57,403
That's right.
Shit happens, to you.

984
01:09:57,575 --> 01:09:59,008
All the time!

985
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:02,635
You know why? Because you don't
follow the ABC's of killing.

986
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:04,805
- There's an ABC's of killing?
- Shut up!

987
01:10:04,982 --> 01:10:07,678
How was I supposed to know
he'd climb in the trunk?

988
01:10:07,852 --> 01:10:09,581
- That's a good question.
- I mean...

989
01:10:09,754 --> 01:10:11,847
I know! How about you
just watch him...

990
01:10:12,023 --> 01:10:13,923
...and you don't let him
climb in!

991
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:18,357
I am a professional marksman.
It's not my job to babysit...

992
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:21,396
You know what? I think
you have to hit something...

993
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:23,830
...to count as a marksman.
- Ozzie. Harriet.

994
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:26,162
Can we stop fighting and go get my wife?

995
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:30,433
Well, you can just forget about
that, Oz. Cynthia is as good as dead.

996
01:10:30,608 --> 01:10:32,599
- What? Don't say that.
- I am saying it.

997
01:10:32,777 --> 01:10:35,211
She's as good as dead.
We have nothing...

998
01:10:35,379 --> 01:10:38,576
...thanks to Jill. Look at this guy.
- Don't pin this on me!

999
01:10:38,883 --> 01:10:41,374
If I'm a screwup,
what are you doing with me?

1000
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:44,043
You know what?
That's a really good question.

1001
01:10:44,222 --> 01:10:45,883
I'm out of here.

1002
01:10:46,057 --> 01:10:48,150
Well, you're not going, are you?

1003
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,654
Hold on a minute.
You're gonna need the keys.

1004
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,996
- Bye-bye.
- I'm serious.

1005
01:10:57,768 --> 01:11:01,101
If I get in that car, you're
never gonna see me again.

1006
01:11:01,272 --> 01:11:03,604
Careful backing out, hon.

1007
01:11:04,775 --> 01:11:06,766
Let's go.

1008
01:11:09,046 --> 01:11:10,946
Bag.

1009
01:11:12,216 --> 01:11:15,379
Why don't you take your pal Strabo
with you. Remember him?

1010
01:11:15,553 --> 01:11:17,919
The Hungarian mobster
that you let die?

1011
01:11:18,089 --> 01:11:20,080
He's sorry. He's very sorry!

1012
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:27,262
She's coming back. I mean,
she's gonna come back, right?

1013
01:11:28,466 --> 01:11:31,026
- I don't think so.
- Oh, well, this is just great.

1014
01:11:31,202 --> 01:11:32,794
What are we gonna do now?

1015
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,733
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

1016
01:11:34,906 --> 01:11:37,033
You're on your own, Oz.

1017
01:11:40,645 --> 01:11:42,112
I thought we were friends.

1018
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:47,675
Well, that's what you get
for trusting a contract killer, Oz.

1019
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:58,854
You son of a bitch.

1020
01:12:03,334 --> 01:12:06,098
You can't do this to Cynthia. Okay?

1021
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:10,604
Not okay. Your darling Cynthia's
not completely innocent in all this, Oz.

1022
01:12:10,775 --> 01:12:15,303
- What? What does that mean?
- Shit, shit, shit! Jill took my bag!

1023
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:18,175
So?
- So there was something really important...

1024
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:20,249
...in the other bag, okay, Oz?

1025
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:42,837
Great.

1026
01:12:45,943 --> 01:12:48,377
- Hello.
- Dentist, you hung up on me.

1027
01:12:48,546 --> 01:12:50,776
- Are you insane?
- Lazlo.

1028
01:12:50,948 --> 01:12:54,145
- Hey, there was a button in the trunk.
- That's great news.

1029
01:12:54,986 --> 01:12:58,217
- Put my son on the phone, damn it!
- He's...

1030
01:12:58,389 --> 01:13:01,654
We're gonna have to
push back that meeting, Lazlo.

1031
01:13:01,826 --> 01:13:04,021
No, no. No pushing.
Put him on the phone.

1032
01:13:04,195 --> 01:13:07,961
I'm sorry, what? I can't hear you.
There seems to be a little static.

1033
01:13:08,132 --> 01:13:11,693
- Are you going through a canyon?
- Am I going through a canyon? No.

1034
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:13,331
Hello?

1035
01:13:13,504 --> 01:13:15,631
- Hello?
- Lazlo? Lazlo?

1036
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:19,634
Dentist! Can you hear me?

1037
01:13:20,644 --> 01:13:23,545
You're seconds from dead.

1038
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:29,381
Strabonitz.

1039
01:13:48,205 --> 01:13:49,502
Hey, Jill.

1040
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:52,164
- It's me. How you doing?
- Let me ask you something.

1041
01:13:52,343 --> 01:13:54,573
If you hadn't taken the wrong bag,
would we be talking?

1042
01:13:54,745 --> 01:13:56,872
- Are you mad or something?
- Get real.

1043
01:13:57,048 --> 01:13:58,481
- I mean, seriously.
- No.

1044
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:01,015
All right? You happy now?

1045
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:03,653
I chased you away
so I could protect you, Jill.

1046
01:14:03,821 --> 01:14:06,813
- I don't know why you don't believe that.
- I don't believe you.

1047
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:08,515
- Jill.
- I don't trust you.

1048
01:14:08,726 --> 01:14:11,854
How am I supposed to have a kid
with somebody I don't trust?

1049
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:16,429
Forget it. I don't even know if
I wanna have a kid with you anymore.

1050
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:18,231
Hold on a minute.

1051
01:14:18,936 --> 01:14:22,497
I think that if I were pregnant
right now, I wouldn't even tell you.

1052
01:14:22,673 --> 01:14:26,507
If you had a son and l...
And you were his mom and I was his dad...

1053
01:14:26,677 --> 01:14:28,372
...you wouldn't let me see him?

1054
01:14:28,546 --> 01:14:30,173
- Not once.
- Don't say that.

1055
01:14:30,414 --> 01:14:32,405
- Take it back right now.
- I'm not.

1056
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:35,848
You better tell me everything now
or I'm not gonna help you.

1057
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:37,715
How far back does this thing go?

1058
01:14:37,888 --> 01:14:39,788
Like a couple days or something.

1059
01:14:39,957 --> 01:14:43,893
You're so full of it.
You're gonna lie to me more?

1060
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:46,086
All right, months.
You happy now?

1061
01:14:46,263 --> 01:14:48,060
And why was Cynthia in on it?

1062
01:14:48,232 --> 01:14:49,722
I wanted to keep you
out of harm's way.

1063
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,959
- You trusted her not to get hurt.
- Jill.

1064
01:14:52,136 --> 01:14:55,731
I gotta go help Oz. For me to do that,
I've gotta go up there.

1065
01:14:55,906 --> 01:14:59,569
- Just do everything I told you, all right?
- Don't worry.

1066
01:14:59,743 --> 01:15:03,270
I'll remember everything you told me.

1067
01:15:15,226 --> 01:15:17,421
Call Mrs. Himelfarb,
remind her to floss...

1068
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:19,688
...cancel my appointments
for the rest of my life...

1069
01:15:19,864 --> 01:15:22,424
...send in as much nitrous as you can,
call the FBI.

1070
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,067
- What?
- Call the FBI!

1071
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:27,865
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

1072
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:29,869
I'll tell you.
Everything's wrong.

1073
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,133
Take a look around you.
Nothing's right.

1074
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:37,044
Cynthia got kidnapped by Hungarian killers.
And instead of calling the FBI...

1075
01:15:37,214 --> 01:15:40,240
...or the police,
like every other rational man, I thought:

1076
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:44,911
"Hey, let's try to get in contact with
somebody else that kills a lot of people."

1077
01:15:45,089 --> 01:15:48,525
So I went down to Mexico,
which is heavily underdeveloped...

1078
01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:50,717
...and I asked him to help me.
Did he?

1079
01:15:50,895 --> 01:15:53,989
No, he didn't help me out.
He didn't help me out!

1080
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:56,497
Know what he did?
He put on bunny slippers...

1081
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,659
...he shot at me and then
he cooked me some chicken!

1082
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:04,537
I'm gonna be okay.

1083
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,039
I'm gonna calm down...

1084
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:10,647
...I'm gonna go downstairs and I'm gonna
take a nice, leisurely drive in my Porsche.

1085
01:16:10,814 --> 01:16:14,716
Wait a minute. I can't drive my Porsche,
because I don't have one anymore.

1086
01:16:14,885 --> 01:16:17,353
That's gone, that's history,
that's archives!

1087
01:16:17,555 --> 01:16:21,150
We left the Porsche so we could get
on a bus and rent some other car.

1088
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:23,623
And you know why?
Because I don't. Do you?

1089
01:16:23,794 --> 01:16:26,854
Some kind of GPS,
I don't know, system.

1090
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:33,126
- What's that smell?
- I'll tell you what that smell is. It's me.

1091
01:16:33,304 --> 01:16:35,431
I smell. And you know why?

1092
01:16:35,606 --> 01:16:38,837
I've been wearing this suit
for three days. I smell like ass.

1093
01:16:39,009 --> 01:16:41,534
Or foot. Or some kind of foot...

1094
01:16:41,712 --> 01:16:46,411
...that's been lodged up deep, deep, deep
inside an ass. I'll tell you the worst thing:

1095
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:50,953
I woke up naked next to another
naked man who admittedly wets the bed.

1096
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:54,113
So if you talk to anybody
or anybody calls here...

1097
01:16:55,726 --> 01:16:58,422
...you tell them I fell down
a flight of stairs.

1098
01:16:58,596 --> 01:17:00,689
- Yes, sir.
- Don't "Yes, sir" me!

1099
01:17:00,864 --> 01:17:03,765
- Call the FBI.
- Calling. I'm calling.

1100
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:05,765
Dial F-B-I.

1101
01:17:06,136 --> 01:17:09,799
Call the FBI and tell them
I fell down a flight of stairs!

1102
01:17:26,757 --> 01:17:30,591
Going to the feds is the thing
that's gonna get Cynthia killed.

1103
01:17:32,162 --> 01:17:34,756
What are you doing here?
I don't need you anymore.

1104
01:17:34,932 --> 01:17:37,457
I can handle this on my own.
I'm an adult.

1105
01:17:44,341 --> 01:17:46,070
You okay?

1106
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:47,676
Thanks.

1107
01:17:48,846 --> 01:17:53,408
Let's face it, Oz. Kicking ass is not
your expertise. That's my job.

1108
01:17:53,817 --> 01:17:57,514
Hanging on to the woman you love
is where I fall a little short.

1109
01:17:58,856 --> 01:18:00,221
- How do you do that?
- What?

1110
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:02,325
That. That.

1111
01:18:02,893 --> 01:18:05,953
One minute I wanna kill you,
the next minute you got me...

1112
01:18:06,397 --> 01:18:09,628
...feeling sorry for you.
- Oz, you really are a good guy.

1113
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,668
And I don't want you, Cynthia or anyone
else paying for my past sins.

1114
01:18:13,837 --> 01:18:16,567
I thought you said friendship
was overrated.

1115
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:19,300
I'm a liar.

1116
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:23,644
- So, what do we do?
- Go get Cynthia.

1117
01:18:23,814 --> 01:18:26,339
- How?
- You just leave that to Jimmy Tudeski.

1118
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:28,174
- God, Julie. Julie, Julie...

1119
01:18:28,352 --> 01:18:30,411
...don't call the FBI!
- Julie who?

1120
01:18:30,587 --> 01:18:33,579
My receptionist.
Your wife's replacement.

1121
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:40,320
- Julie, what did you do?
- I chloroformed his ass.

1122
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:42,294
Why?
You don't have to tell me why.

1123
01:18:42,466 --> 01:18:45,799
Now, you can go quietly or your ass
can get the chloroform too.

1124
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:50,365
- What kind of receptionist are you?
- The kind that doesn't forget...

1125
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,374
...who murdered her brother.
- What?

1126
01:18:53,544 --> 01:18:56,172
Look, I'm gonna get
the temp agency on the phone.

1127
01:18:56,347 --> 01:19:00,181
Don't you dare make a move,
Dr. Oseransky. Keep your ass right there.

1128
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:03,514
Julie. Julie, if that is your real name...

1129
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:06,713
My name is Jules. Jules Figueroa.

1130
01:19:12,463 --> 01:19:15,955
- Frankie Figs?
- Frankie Figs.

1131
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:20,536
You remember that? He was my brother.
And I do believe you knew him.

1132
01:19:22,072 --> 01:19:25,235
- I'll take that chloroform now.
- Yeah, I know you will.

1133
01:19:43,527 --> 01:19:47,691
- You smell great, baby.
- Oz.

1134
01:19:49,233 --> 01:19:52,361
You know, I don't have to be
at work today. We can:

1135
01:19:55,038 --> 01:19:57,063
Oz.

1136
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:08,451
Jimmy.

1137
01:20:09,186 --> 01:20:11,780
Jimmy. Jimmy!

1138
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,822
It's been a long time since
I've been chloroformed.

1139
01:20:18,996 --> 01:20:21,294
Still got that little zing to it,
though.

1140
01:20:22,299 --> 01:20:25,928
Tastes like they put a bunch of pennies
in your mouth, doesn't it?

1141
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:28,701
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

1142
01:20:28,872 --> 01:20:30,362
- I didn't find it.
- What?

1143
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,031
You've been here three days.

1144
01:20:32,209 --> 01:20:34,473
- I got into the safe. It's not there.
- Safe?

1145
01:20:34,645 --> 01:20:36,909
- It's here somewhere.
- This isn't exactly...

1146
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,708
...what we talked about, either.
- Calm down.

1147
01:20:39,883 --> 01:20:42,716
- What do mean, "Calm down"?
- All right? I'm on it.

1148
01:20:42,886 --> 01:20:46,982
What safe? Why are you guys
talking together so much?

1149
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:03,768
Have you been involved in this
from the beginning?

1150
01:21:04,007 --> 01:21:06,271
- Oz...
- Correct me if I'm wrong...

1151
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:08,274
...but we took vows.

1152
01:21:08,445 --> 01:21:11,471
One was you're not
supposed to pretend you're kidnapped...

1153
01:21:11,648 --> 01:21:14,913
...and get your husband shot at
while he's trying to save you.

1154
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,814
- That was uncalled for.
- I'm not a lawyer...

1155
01:21:17,988 --> 01:21:20,752
...but I believe this is grounds for divorce.

1156
01:21:20,924 --> 01:21:23,188
And what is that sound?

1157
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,796
- That's chain saws.
- Chain saw. Check.

1158
01:21:27,297 --> 01:21:29,162
Hack tub.

1159
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:32,697
What is that for?

1160
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:36,366
- What is it?
- They hack us up into pieces in that...

1161
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,941
...so blood doesn't get everywhere.
- I see.

1162
01:21:41,478 --> 01:21:43,844
They put the hacked-up
pieces in those bags.

1163
01:21:44,014 --> 01:21:47,506
- Are you done?
- Yes, he's done.

1164
01:21:49,219 --> 01:21:54,657
Jimmy Tulip.
The rat-shit scum of Chicago.

1165
01:21:55,225 --> 01:21:56,954
Mr. Tough Guy...

1166
01:21:57,127 --> 01:22:01,757
...served up to me on a platter
by the pretty black girl.

1167
01:22:03,634 --> 01:22:05,033
That stings.

1168
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:08,965
I made you who you are
and you stab me in the heart...

1169
01:22:09,573 --> 01:22:11,700
...with something sharp.

1170
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:13,467
He made you who you are?

1171
01:22:13,744 --> 01:22:18,113
Oh, yes. Could not fire a slingshot
until I taught him how.

1172
01:22:18,282 --> 01:22:20,876
"Pay attention, little boy. Hold it firm.

1173
01:22:21,051 --> 01:22:24,384
Stop crying and watch.
Like this."

1174
01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:32,420
- Where's Strabo?
- I'm pretty sure he's with Janni right now.

1175
01:22:34,231 --> 01:22:40,397
Where is my son?

1176
01:22:46,543 --> 01:22:49,512
- Where's my boy?!
- All right, that's it. I've had enough.

1177
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,910
- Oz.
- No. If you ever wanna see your son...

1178
01:22:52,082 --> 01:22:54,346
...alive again, you'll let
us go right now.

1179
01:22:54,518 --> 01:22:56,452
Is that right?

1180
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,781
Yeah, that's right.

1181
01:22:58,956 --> 01:23:01,652
And if we're not out of here by 1 1:00...

1182
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:06,922
...Jill's gonna put one in Strabo's forehead,
just like Jimmy put one in Janni's forehead.

1183
01:23:08,966 --> 01:23:11,526
- It wasn't pretty.
- Give me a gun.

1184
01:23:11,702 --> 01:23:13,533
- Not bad, Oz.
- Thanks.

1185
01:23:16,306 --> 01:23:18,137
- I think it's Jimmy's wife.
- What?

1186
01:23:18,308 --> 01:23:19,775
No. That was going so well.

1187
01:23:19,943 --> 01:23:21,672
- What is this?
- I wanna come in...

1188
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:23,506
...and talk business with you.

1189
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,375
- Or else.
- Or else what?

1190
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:29,144
Or else I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to blow Strabo's head off.

1191
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:31,617
Oh, no, no, no.
Strabo, you all right?

1192
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,722
He's fine.

1193
01:23:39,396 --> 01:23:42,297
He can't talk, he's duct-taped.

1194
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,926
I got this car wired with explosives.

1195
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:48,563
- You let me in, he'll be fine.
- Fine.

1196
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:53,540
Come in, do whatever you want, apparently.
Get the broad! Get the car! Get the Strabo!

1197
01:23:56,847 --> 01:23:58,974
Wait a minute.
What is in the big purse?

1198
01:23:59,149 --> 01:24:01,777
- Nothing, it's... I'm good.
- It's what?

1199
01:24:01,952 --> 01:24:03,419
- Take a right.
- This way.

1200
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:06,920
What the fook are you
assholes up to now?

1201
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:09,285
Look who's here.

1202
01:24:10,494 --> 01:24:13,292
Can I ask you a questionnaire
how you found this place?

1203
01:24:13,463 --> 01:24:14,828
Nice Porsche you got.

1204
01:24:14,998 --> 01:24:16,989
You still have the Porsche?

1205
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:19,931
Let me explain when we all get
a moment together...

1206
01:24:20,103 --> 01:24:22,765
...the concept of the secret hideout.
- All right!

1207
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:25,339
Drop your weapons now
and slide them to me...

1208
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:29,605
...or I press the button and Strabo gets
blown to little Hungarian meatballs.

1209
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:33,147
- Don't push nothing.
- I'm gonna push it. Drop them! Now!

1210
01:24:33,316 --> 01:24:34,647
- Drop them!
- Drop it.

1211
01:24:34,818 --> 01:24:36,809
- Go ahead. Come on.
- On the floor.

1212
01:24:36,987 --> 01:24:39,387
Kick them over. Step away.

1213
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:44,384
- Untie Oz and Cynthia.
- No untying...

1214
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:47,291
- Do it! Untie them.
- Let's see where it's going.

1215
01:24:47,464 --> 01:24:49,694
All right. Come on, come on.

1216
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:54,064
Aren't you forgetting something?

1217
01:24:54,237 --> 01:24:56,899
Am I forgetting something?
I don't think so.

1218
01:24:57,107 --> 01:24:59,575
- They had a terrible fight.
- Did they?

1219
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:04,942
- What if I had something you want?
- I would be baffled, to begin with.

1220
01:25:05,115 --> 01:25:06,639
Or, more precisely...

1221
01:25:09,319 --> 01:25:11,150
...half of something you want.

1222
01:25:12,022 --> 01:25:13,284
Don't.

1223
01:25:14,224 --> 01:25:17,022
You have Jimmy's half.

1224
01:25:18,428 --> 01:25:21,955
- Would you cut me in for a slice?
- You want a slice of the pee?

1225
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:25,164
Maybe...

1226
01:25:25,802 --> 01:25:28,999
- Keep talking.
- I wanna work for you.

1227
01:25:29,172 --> 01:25:32,073
- Of course you do.
- I don't have any allegiances.

1228
01:25:32,242 --> 01:25:35,678
I'm all yours. And I could be your
most valuable hitter.

1229
01:25:38,048 --> 01:25:40,744
You shut up or I'll
blow your brains out!

1230
01:25:41,685 --> 01:25:46,179
First thing I'm going to need
is my son Strabo in my company.

1231
01:25:46,356 --> 01:25:48,221
Secondly, maybe a little test.

1232
01:25:48,391 --> 01:25:51,292
I'm thinking, kill Jimmy.

1233
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:54,720
In the melon. One shot.

1234
01:25:54,898 --> 01:25:57,264
- What do you say?
- Name the time and place.

1235
01:25:57,667 --> 01:26:00,465
Is now good for you?

1236
01:26:04,574 --> 01:26:08,066
- Right here, right now?
- Right now.

1237
01:26:13,049 --> 01:26:16,416
- You gotta be kidding me, right?
- What the hell are you doing?

1238
01:26:18,255 --> 01:26:19,813
Take your little cross back.

1239
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,015
What'll you do without
your good luck charm?

1240
01:26:22,192 --> 01:26:24,126
- Stop screwing around.
- Shut up, Oz!

1241
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:28,230
That's right, Jill, stop screwing around.
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

1242
01:26:28,398 --> 01:26:31,458
Just tell me you're not
still in love with Cynthia.

1243
01:26:31,635 --> 01:26:33,603
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?

1244
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:37,399
She's my ex-wife. I still have feelings
for her and I always will.

1245
01:26:37,607 --> 01:26:40,075
- That's a really bad answer.
- Shut up, Oz.

1246
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:42,871
You can't even just say it, can you?

1247
01:26:43,046 --> 01:26:44,343
Just say it.

1248
01:26:44,948 --> 01:26:48,349
This is reminding me now
of my favorite soup opera:

1249
01:26:48,518 --> 01:26:50,816
The Hourglass of My Sand Children.

1250
01:26:52,923 --> 01:26:57,189
Listen, you're either a shooter
or you're not.

1251
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,022
I am. I am.

1252
01:27:00,497 --> 01:27:01,828
I am.

1253
01:27:02,265 --> 01:27:03,857
Here's an idea for you:

1254
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:07,299
- Got an elevator shaft around here, Lazlo?
- I'm sorry?

1255
01:27:08,305 --> 01:27:11,274
Because I could fall down that,
you know. Die that way.

1256
01:27:11,441 --> 01:27:14,205
- Stop.
- That would be the only way to get killed.

1257
01:27:14,444 --> 01:27:17,436
- Shut up!
- You couldn't even hit that lamp over there.

1258
01:27:17,914 --> 01:27:21,509
I'll give you a tip. You wanna hit that
lamp, you should aim at me.

1259
01:27:23,353 --> 01:27:24,877
She aimed and hit the lamp.

1260
01:27:25,055 --> 01:27:26,579
She aimed and hit the lamp.

1261
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:29,884
- Lucky shot.
- I'm gonna give you one last chance, baby.

1262
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,721
You don't have the balls.

1263
01:27:31,962 --> 01:27:35,591
- This from a guy who rarely gets it up.
- We never had that problem.

1264
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:38,131
Not helping.
Why isn't anybody helping?

1265
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:41,964
I think you have to be in love
with someone to get it up, Jill.

1266
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,602
Shoot him.

1267
01:27:44,774 --> 01:27:46,639
You're never gonna be a hit girl...

1268
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:51,509
...just a stupid, stumbling, bumbling,
can't-kill-anything ex-dental assistant.

1269
01:28:03,493 --> 01:28:05,484
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
- He's dead?

1270
01:28:05,662 --> 01:28:07,857
- Yes?
- He's dead. He's dead!

1271
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:11,967
He's dead! I didn't think you
had it in you, quite frankly.

1272
01:28:12,135 --> 01:28:15,502
Don't cry. Everything's going
to be fine. Go get Strabo, now.

1273
01:28:15,672 --> 01:28:19,972
Give me this. For the record,
this is, what, a garage door opener?

1274
01:28:20,277 --> 01:28:22,108
Very clever.

1275
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:27,615
So clever, I want you to keep
that aimed at her, please.

1276
01:28:27,784 --> 01:28:31,220
- Wait. I thought we had a deal.
- "I thought we had a deal." No.

1277
01:28:34,024 --> 01:28:35,286
Locked.

1278
01:28:41,765 --> 01:28:44,233
Lazlo, the car is loaded with Primacord.

1279
01:28:46,403 --> 01:28:48,234
I'm sure it is.

1280
01:28:48,838 --> 01:28:52,638
The first dollar
I ever stole is back together.

1281
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:10,654
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:13,063 --> 01:29:17,466
You killed Strabonitz.

1283
01:29:21,071 --> 01:29:22,333
Oh, look what I did.

1284
01:29:29,112 --> 01:29:31,103
Good work, Jimmy.
"Jammy, Jammy."

1285
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:33,781
Nice work with that chair, Oz.
Way to go, Cyn.

1286
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,850
- Come here, baby.
- You're alive?

1287
01:29:36,019 --> 01:29:37,577
I mean, good, but you...

1288
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:44,427
Don't even think about it. You were
in on this whole thing from the beginning!

1289
01:29:44,594 --> 01:29:47,688
Of course. It's an old routine.
It's the Skokie Switcheroo.

1290
01:29:47,864 --> 01:29:51,493
"The Skokie Switch..."? Where do
you guys come up with these names?

1291
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:54,432
I just watched my friend
get shot through the heart.

1292
01:29:54,604 --> 01:29:58,131
- Larry's House of Halloween.
- And what is the deal with that lamp?

1293
01:29:58,308 --> 01:30:00,276
I saw her shoot the lamp.

1294
01:30:00,443 --> 01:30:03,776
The first round was live, the rest
were blanks. Try and keep up.

1295
01:30:03,947 --> 01:30:07,246
- We are gonna have such a talk later.
- Sons of batches!

1296
01:30:08,685 --> 01:30:12,416
So how far back does this go?
Hell, you were shooting at me in Mexico.

1297
01:30:12,589 --> 01:30:14,648
Was that all part of the plan?

1298
01:30:14,824 --> 01:30:16,951
As a matter of fact, it was, yeah.

1299
01:30:17,594 --> 01:30:21,553
- You killed my Strabo!
- Actually, Strabonitz was already dead.

1300
01:30:21,731 --> 01:30:24,256
Your hitter got him
when she was shooting at us.

1301
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:27,732
- This true?
- Lazlo, shit happens.

1302
01:30:27,904 --> 01:30:29,303
Shit...

1303
01:30:29,472 --> 01:30:31,064
Yeah, watch this shit happen.

1304
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:37,471
- All right. Take it easy.
- Was that real? Is she really dead?

1305
01:30:37,647 --> 01:30:39,512
I mean, was that a fake bullet?

1306
01:30:40,383 --> 01:30:45,377
Jimmy, let me propose something
before you start the killing.

1307
01:30:45,555 --> 01:30:49,457
Regroup the Gogolak gang.
Fifty-fifty, you and me.

1308
01:30:49,626 --> 01:30:54,120
Like the old days.
Murder, mayhem, a couple of laughs.

1309
01:30:55,498 --> 01:30:58,899
I don't think so, Lazlo.
Jill, tie him up.

1310
01:30:59,069 --> 01:31:01,094
- Wait.
- What am I gonna tie him up for?

1311
01:31:01,271 --> 01:31:03,136
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, he said...

1312
01:31:03,306 --> 01:31:04,830
I said that, but we can't.

1313
01:31:05,008 --> 01:31:08,000
Of course you can't.
You can't kill anybody for real.

1314
01:31:08,178 --> 01:31:09,702
I can. It's point-blank range.

1315
01:31:09,879 --> 01:31:12,040
I didn't mean you can't shoot him...

1316
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:14,649
...I mean you just can't shoot him.
- Come on.

1317
01:31:14,818 --> 01:31:17,343
- You said I'll make my bones.
- On somebody else.

1318
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,920
- You can't kill him.
- How do you "make bones"?

1319
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,285
She wants to make a name for herself.

1320
01:31:22,459 --> 01:31:23,790
You said I could!

1321
01:31:23,993 --> 01:31:26,325
- Will you just listen?
- Tell me why.

1322
01:31:26,496 --> 01:31:28,930
- You heard what he said!
- Tell me why not!

1323
01:31:29,099 --> 01:31:31,260
Because he's my father!

1324
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:35,370
- Even I didn't know about this.
- See? See?

1325
01:31:35,538 --> 01:31:39,804
It doesn't feel good to not be involved
in the plan, to not know what...

1326
01:31:40,276 --> 01:31:43,939
- He's your father?
- I raised you as one of my own.

1327
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:47,416
- That's far enough.
- I made him a man!

1328
01:31:49,352 --> 01:31:52,150
A man who can't kill his papa.

1329
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:58,757
Step aside, Jill. It could go right through.

1330
01:32:01,698 --> 01:32:04,189
Jimmy.

1331
01:32:09,772 --> 01:32:13,435
- Jill, shoot Papa in the foot.
- Straight through or leave a souvenir?

1332
01:32:13,643 --> 01:32:15,372
- Souvenir.
- Wait.

1333
01:32:18,181 --> 01:32:19,842
That's gotta hurt.

1334
01:32:20,984 --> 01:32:24,511
- Who is that? The fake police?
- Okay, we gotta go.

1335
01:32:24,687 --> 01:32:28,350
I'm not going anywhere until somebody
tells me what this is all about.

1336
01:32:28,525 --> 01:32:32,757
Cynthia, help me get Oz out of here.
Thanks for the inheritance, Pops.

1337
01:32:33,796 --> 01:32:37,254
- Way to go, Cyn.
- You'll never live to spend a dime, Jimmy!

1338
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:50,973
We're rich! We're rich!

1339
01:32:53,183 --> 01:32:55,811
- Baby, you were so good.
- I had a good teacher.

1340
01:32:55,985 --> 01:32:59,944
I'm so glad we're so overjoyed.
I've never been this confused in my life.

1341
01:33:00,156 --> 01:33:02,488
I think you dropped this a while back.

1342
01:33:02,659 --> 01:33:06,186
No, just borrowing it
from an old friend, that's all.

1343
01:33:06,362 --> 01:33:09,229
- Don't need it anymore, Cyn.
- Okay.

1344
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:11,390
Would somebody tell me
what's going on?

1345
01:33:11,601 --> 01:33:14,729
This is what's going on.
See that number right there?

1346
01:33:14,904 --> 01:33:18,101
That is Lazlo Gogolak's main account
in the Grand Caymans.

1347
01:33:18,274 --> 01:33:22,176
Somewhere around 280 million dollars,
half of which is yours.

1348
01:33:22,612 --> 01:33:24,739
Your tooth-pulling days are over, Oz.

1349
01:33:24,914 --> 01:33:26,848
- That was the plan?
- Yes!

1350
01:33:27,116 --> 01:33:30,051
- Were you in on it?
- I didn't know until this afternoon.

1351
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,085
Why couldn't I have been involved?

1352
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:34,519
I could have played a part.
I minored in theater.

1353
01:33:34,691 --> 01:33:37,091
Two hundred and eighty million dollars?

1354
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:41,560
That's it. This is too much.
It's great, but it's too much.

1355
01:33:41,798 --> 01:33:44,494
- Any more surprises?
- Just one.

1356
01:33:44,667 --> 01:33:46,658
- What?
- I guess the doctors were wrong.

1357
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,933
- What do you mean?
- I'm pregnant.

1358
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:50,902
Oh, my God, congratulations!

1359
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:53,103
Oh, my God, are you serious?

1360
01:33:53,409 --> 01:33:54,899
I'm gonna be a dad?

1361
01:34:03,586 --> 01:34:06,612
We're not gonna start
with that again, are we?

1362
01:34:12,528 --> 01:34:15,429
Put the top up, okay?
It's just... It's embarrassing.

1363
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:24,465
- Come on, come and get me.
- Freeze, right there!

1364
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:29,378
- Cross, cross.
- Watch it, buster.

1365
01:34:29,545 --> 01:34:34,744
Anybody for cookie, coffee, tea?

1366
01:34:34,917 --> 01:34:37,078
Mother, please.

1367
01:34:38,354 --> 01:34:42,552
One of you, could
you just shoot me? Please.
