1
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,439
Sit.

2
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:43,022
How do you feel today?

3
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:45,899
Today is a great day for you, eh?

4
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,092
Your last meeting as a guest
in this place.

5
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,255
Three years is a long, does not it?

6
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,401
Must feel great.

7
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,153
Climber upset sentenced
to 3 years in mental institution.

8
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,018
- It's going well, mate.
- And I appreciate your help.

9
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:08,115
Walter, my friend, you are able
to inspire a book.

10
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,932
I'm thinking of a complete chapter.

11
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:12,089
I'm waiting for arrives
spring and has more market share.

12
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,357
It is the story of a man who
climbing accident ...

13
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,281
short rope hanging
his friends to save himself.

14
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:20,766
Mountaineering accident leaves three dead.
Sole survivor arrested.

15
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,888
The murder conviction
without premeditation.

16
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,008
Sounds attractive.

17
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,438
Technically, I made an agreement
with the prosecutor.

18
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:32,438
Yes, and technically means that
I plead guilty.

19
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,260
I have only a formality.

20
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:40,446
These are your appointments for the
next year.

21
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:43,626
- But the judge said ...
- The judge does not determine the need ...

22
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,688
to continue treatment, I do.

23
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,904
The fact that you think is really
you leave these walls, ...

24
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,995
not mean that we have completed
with our work.

25
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:53,784
A year of compulsory treatment.

26
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,713
- And then you reevaluate.
- I understand that what I did was wrong.

27
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:04,893
I know that three people died
for what I did.

28
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,113
- Sorry.
- I believe you.

29
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,930
Otherwise, do not give
probation.

30
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:16,505
But we are having problems
the question of the decision.

31
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,899
I realize that I could
have taken another decision that day.

32
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:23,807
See, this is where the sincerity
becomes questionable.

33
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,838
Because I remember your
exact words, Walter and you?

34
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:31,080
You said "anyone could have
made the same decision I did. "

35
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:32,838
Either.

36
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,651
I do not think so.

37
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,635
Those are just words, Walter.

38
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,968
Let's see how you doing out there.

39
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:48,239
One year.

40
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,269
Continue treatment.

41
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:55,997
Sign and return to your room.

42
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,956
You know what that is, Walter?

43
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,381
Progress.

44
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,228
Progress does not mean
that we're done.

45
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,683
What we seek is complete.

46
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,710
Murder theory

47
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:47,365
Hey, look down the camera and
the road, man.

48
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,828
No, not until I read Nicole
seriously.

49
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,556
I love you.

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,648
Seriously, when was the last time
we passed through a gas station?

51
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,049
- I look forward to urinate.
- I would have got if ...

52
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,503
we did not have to wait
quickie for you by morning.

53
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,626
For the umpteenth time, we fell asleep.

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,511
Since you took it to her as the
seriously, do not share even a small detail.

55
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:10,086
You're a loose, bro.

56
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,058
- He is a gentleman.
- Thanks, baby.

57
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,602
Brent, tell me, do you wonder about
Amber and you all the time?

58
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:18,122
What do you know?

59
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,515
She shaves,
I, too, is a spectacle ...

60
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,455
Brent, enough.

61
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,706
The bathrooms are on the right.

62
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:41,587
Brent, my friend, I love
this damn house.

63
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:47,653
In case you had not noticed.

64
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:49,835
Son of a bitch.

65
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:55,014
Hey, Freddy, sexy sister
at 12 o'clock.

66
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,280
I will not engage with the sister
Brent, is disgusting.

67
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,688
Sister, right? I know I
you like or pale or red, ..

68
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:08,056
but it is not as red or
so pale. You're going to take.

69
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,259
I did not know they came this weekend.

70
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,174
I did not know he had to say when
I come to stay at home.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,185
If you were going to bring some friends,
sorry, the rooms are full.

72
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,411
It is not all misery and desolation.
I am alone, does no wrong.

73
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,099
Walk in things
strange girl.

74
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,281
- What return?
- What return?

75
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:27,707
That's Alex.

76
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:30,191
If it helps, Nicole and I can
sleep on the portal.

77
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,584
A little love outdoors.

78
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,307
Hello, beauty.

79
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,997
Is the wonder drug
you nervous?

80
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:56,133
Do not play doctor with me. Please
were safe, do not they prescribed.

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,161
You know who prescribe anything.

82
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,741
Especially on Tuesdays and
Thursdays.

83
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,499
Dr. B. loves
the earring from my navel.

84
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,408
I bet it is.

85
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:10,013
The problem is that my friend
could not your size.

86
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,164
- Stop ashamed, guys.
- Tell them you do not need their help.

87
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,891
She would be lucky to be with you.

88
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,133
- I'm Jennifer.
- Hi, Alex.

89
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,040
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Freddy.

90
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:31,257
Go, Dad.

91
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,981
Do not be fooled by the physical,
has a heart of gold.

92
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,346
The girls at school
Freddy Teddy tell.

93
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,551
But the eye is a tornado
between the sheets.

94
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:44,164
- It's a lie.
- Freddy.

95
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,085
Azar's your specialty, right?

96
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:51,002
Make the favor and starts.

97
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:55,680
I will make a bartender
if you show the barbecue now.

98
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,504
The bar is officially open.

99
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,444
What are you looking?

100
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,746
I can not believe Dad
Brent has left all this.

101
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,168
I think Brent's dad has more
toys at home than it can use.

102
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,624
But Amber loves that.

103
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:15,138
Be nice.

104
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,380
Well?

105
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:23,076
How long have you
Enli you?

106
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,991
"Enli?

107
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,421
One year.

108
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,998
- Great.
- I think I understand.

109
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,724
All are in pairs, right?

110
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:39,480
Yes, you're alone and I also.
But I'll leave this clear.

111
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:42,691
You look like a nice guy,
but ...

112
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,633
I'm not into nice guys.

113
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:47,723
Never even slept with
a teddy bear as a child.

114
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:51,935
Well, I'm staying in the room
and you on the couch.

115
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:55,903
- Nice to meet you.
- Sounds good.

116
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:02,331
This is crazy.

117
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:07,328
Do not tell me you have not thrown tipas
of all colors in this boat.

118
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:10,350
This boat really
gives me joy.

119
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:15,841
Over here.

120
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,183
Well, be careful.

121
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:33,484
This is very gangster.

122
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,908
I'm Tony Montana.

123
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,118
Partner, why not have it at home?

124
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:42,847
By idiots like you.

125
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,120
Will you let me shoot it once?

126
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,605
Tomorrow, right? When we get in
the boat, you can shoot it.

127
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:59,632
Why have one of these
if you can not send even a message?

128
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,473
Can you?

129
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,343
Come on, we are adults.

130
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,445
The last time we did this
was on that cruise ...

131
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,505
did last year.
- It was a fun trip.

132
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,051
You're a liar, I spent the whole
bugging time that ...

133
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,990
take me to the spring festival.
- Yes, it was.

134
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,327
Below.

135
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,242
But now that I think I recognize that
were the best vacation of my life.

136
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:51,851
- I can not believe we leave
to graduate. - Oh, do not mention it.

137
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:54,456
- Will not you graduate?
- No, not really.

138
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,242
Is that when reaching
the end, you realize that ...

139
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,124
not have everything you wanted.

140
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,334
I was not mature enough
to realize what was important.

141
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,309
- Amber ...
- Relax, just kidding.

142
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,206
We no longer walk with jueguitos
long.

143
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,839
"Last summer you think
long?

144
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:26,126
We had ten hours drinking, was
Error binge. You know.

145
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:30,367
Let's spend some time
with others or something.

146
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,728
- Before the drinks?
- Yes

147
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,310
It's like a tradition.

148
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:39,503
I swear, whoever it has been
come to think that "151" with ...

149
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,293
Tabasco sauce was a good drink,
should be killed.

150
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,535
It's a disgusting drink,
that's the point.

151
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:48,902
- Freddy, "as are the burgers?
- No, I'm cleaning the ...

152
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,328
Well, let marinate meat.

153
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:53,661
Okay.

154
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,690
Thanks, bro.

155
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,841
- What?
- Do not tell me that you will give the ...

156
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,871
big guy a roll of charity?

157
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,174
What is that? "Protection
half brother?

158
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,357
Alex, I think your mom seems
pleasant, but the fact that ...

159
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,112
by chance your mom is
next to my dad ...

160
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,687
and you come included in the package,
does not make us family.

161
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:34,660
Okay, because to me your dad
is just the moneybags number 5.

162
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,748
Health brother.

163
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,637
Do you remember the girl he
Freddy spoke last weekend?

164
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,456
- Yes, the dark one of the party.
- Yes

165
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,514
At the end of the night, she gave
Brent a blowjob in the bathroom.

166
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,180
- Poor, Amber.
- In other words, poor Freddy.

167
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,270
I know you're partner
Amber Quarter and all that ...

168
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:02,573
But Brent is not a paragon of virtue.
She needs to know.

169
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:05,604
We are staying at his house, right?

170
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,855
"Brother, can you prepare meat
for hamburgers? "

171
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,427
Idiot.
"Could you prepare a hamburger?"

172
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,456
We will prepare, to prepare you.

173
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,495
A little hot sauce
for Adobe.

174
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:30,313
And a pinch of salt.
I think so you know well.

175
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,703
Enjoying your food?

176
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,794
This is the best burger in the world.
How is yours?

177
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:53,430
- Have a little.
- If you take whiskey, you're going to drop fire.

178
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,099
I do not drink whiskey after dinner,
that's you.

179
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,039
Hey, what's that?

180
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:08,885
Oh, my God.

181
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,262
Oh, my God.

182
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,296
Look for a room.

183
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,079
Come on up there to get away
of others.

184
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,931
- We have not yet provided.
- Then do it.

185
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:31,028
- I will later.
- Dress handcuffs.

186
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:34,362
Listen, guys.

187
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:38,935
As we are all about to graduate
and next year we almost all ...

188
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,905
in different cities, I think
imposing a toast.

189
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,124
It was not my idea.

190
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:51,101
Jennifer, I think I never
I told you this, ...

191
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:55,797
but we are all
very glad you came ...

192
00:13:56,372 --> 00:14:01,281
because the girl he left
Mikey before you, ...

193
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,251
- Leave her alone.
- What?

194
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,583
- Here.
- Son of a bitch.

195
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:10,464
- What was it?
- Say you had arms ...

196
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,009
strangely short.

197
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:15,735
- Mikey.
- Oh, Mikey.

198
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:18,523
Thank you for taking the item,
I appreciate that.

199
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,550
I can not believe to be
admit this, but ...

200
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,490
The first time I saw
was shawns Rock.

201
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:32,344
You used the short white shirt
and pair of jeans with the hole ...

202
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,585
in the right place.
- Quick.

203
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:36,950
Oh, God.

204
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:43,191
And all I remember is that I
I was incredibly nervous ...

205
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:46,493
because he knew he was approaching
to speak, had to do ...

206
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,530
but had no idea what to say.

207
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:54,342
I guess what I'm saying ...

208
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,645
is that they have been about four years
beautiful y. ..

209
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:02,947
I want everyone to know that I could not
having shared with better people.

210
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,218
- Health.
- Health.

211
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,763
Wait a minute.

212
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,702
I know I did not attend school
with you, but can I say something?

213
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,189
- Of course.
- Is this OK?

214
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:17,732
Thank you.

215
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,278
For my fast friend, ...

216
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,668
who go to bed with a
Templones lot of university.

217
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,395
Come on.

218
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,182
- Is that going to kill you?
- Tastes like piss of old.

219
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,350
Gotcha.

220
00:15:58,932 --> 00:15:59,658
Oh!

221
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,052
- Come on down.
- No.

222
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,073
Slowly.

223
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:49,667
- You are so beautiful.
- And I'm with you.

224
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:51,944
I am sitting here.

225
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,410
You have to work a little
before reaching it, baby.

226
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:23,526
"Kid?

227
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,496
What the hell did you do?

228
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,159
- What the hell happened!
- What happened!

229
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,249
Move it, damn it, move it!

230
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,854
- Nena.
- What the fuck!

231
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,433
Oh, my God.

232
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,670
It must be a joke,
no tone!

233
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,990
Somebody close the window
now.

234
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,775
What happened?
What the hell happened!

235
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:37,926
I do not know, I was out.

236
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,170
Hello? Hello?

237
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,171
Crap.

238
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:48,138
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, God, what the hell does that say?

239
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:50,841
TV

240
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,628
Turn it on.

241
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:02,593
I love you.

242
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:04,963
Please

243
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:10,781
- What gives you the gun?
- Please, please.

244
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,597
Oh, God, Carlos.

245
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,507
- What are you doing?
- Continued, Nicole.

246
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:25,414
What the hell is that?

247
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,893
Pull the trigger.

248
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:39,807
- What the hell!
- Turn around, turn around.

249
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:46,249
She saved you, Carlos.

250
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,232
These were my best friends.

251
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,806
If someone had asked me when
I threw this picture, if the kill ...

252
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,867
I would have said was impossible.

253
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:00,776
But I did.

254
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,899
Nicole had the same option
with all of you:

255
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,932
Ending the life of another person ...

256
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,962
to save your own.

257
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,426
Now death is certain
for everyone in the house.

258
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:26,513
There is only one solution: kill their
friends or die with them.

259
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:32,905
- If they escape they will die.
- Turn it off.

260
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,175
If at 6:00 a. m is one
live alone, is free.

261
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:42,547
But if one is more alive
at 6. 00, all die.

262
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,122
Bastard!

263
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,876
- Why did not you hear that?
- I was unconscious of drunkenness!

264
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:52,789
Brent!

265
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,762
- Brent, what are you looking for!
- My dad has a rifle.

266
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:02,669
- And now that you mention?
- Not now, blanquita of the underworld.

267
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,520
- Fuck you, asshole!
- Hey, look for the rifle.

268
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:10,183
- You okay?
- Yes

269
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,519
- The rifle went missing.
- Disappeared?

270
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,336
Are pictures of us?

271
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:21,313
What the hell.

272
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,713
This was two months ago.

273
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,291
Will being followed?

274
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:34,441
He has been stalking.

275
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,683
The rifle was their first strategy.

276
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,499
They will have to improve.

277
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,515
Now look around you,
Who do you trust more?

278
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:49,635
In their boyfriends, their girlfriends?

279
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,155
Who do you trust less?

280
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:56,093
In the narcissist?
In the intruder?

281
00:22:57,244 --> 00:23:00,081
Maybe the guy who put tabasco
in the burger of your friend?

282
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:06,569
In the next three hours show
how to live.

283
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,968
Away from me is impossible, so
begin to think about ...

284
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:13,937
how to escape from each other.

285
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,177
Only one back home.

286
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:26,628
What do we do?

287
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,694
- What about your neighbor?
- Or make a fire?

288
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:35,940
- We can set fire to something y. ..
- Listen to me, no one is 80 kms

289
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,277
God, how and why simply
not we leave?

290
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,558
Brilliant, the guy probably is
up a tree ...

291
00:23:41,872 --> 00:23:43,769
rifle with my dad for
keep us out.

292
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:48,402
We will close the doors and put a
trap if you try to enter the house.

293
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,551
Crap.

294
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:57,399
- Easy.
- No, I will stay ...

295
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,246
to wait until it destroys us crazy.

296
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,457
- Has a gun.
- We.

297
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:03,942
Carlos, a partner, no!

298
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:07,517
- It's going to get my gun.
- Hello, is anyone there?

299
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:11,227
Did anyone hear me?

300
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:12,894
Hello?

301
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,412
- What do we do?
- Forget what you said bastard.

302
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:20,537
Just trying to scare us
for us to separate.

303
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:23,294
Let's go, close the doors
and windows and wait ...

304
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:24,840
to return the boys.

305
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,599
Well, come on.

306
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,229
Grab a chair.

307
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,497
Carlos, wait!

308
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,284
Carlos, wait!
What are you doing!

309
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:54,391
Please stop!
Watch the boat!

310
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:55,996
It is sinking!

311
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,425
- Stop!
- What the fuck do!

312
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:03,331
- Come!
- Shit! Shit!

313
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,963
Opened!

314
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:08,871
Shit!

315
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:43,097
- This will not stop!
- But make noise if you try to enter.

316
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:25,077
Help me, dammit!
Help!

317
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,507
- Resist, resist.
- Help me!

318
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,596
Resist, my friend.
Resist.

319
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,116
Oh, God.

320
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:44,322
Do not shoot, do not shoot.

321
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,535
Sorry, partner.

322
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,781
We must leave here.
We have to get out.

323
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,419
We can not leave without them!

324
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,932
- If you are returning.
- Man, that's very strong.

325
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:08,928
We're screwed.

326
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:12,504
Alex, this is the end.
We all die.

327
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,623
Why are we so quiet?

328
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:18,349
Hey, relax.

329
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,591
Please.

330
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:24,773
Maybe he's right.

331
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:26,740
Maybe we should go to the truck
and leave.

332
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:30,044
Baby, we must
them more time, OK?

333
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,859
Amber, get away from the window.
Come here.

334
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,092
Return.

335
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,125
- Where is Carlos?
- Close the door!

336
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,580
- Where is Carlos!
- He's dead.

337
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,366
He's dead, dammit.

338
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,728
I found a kind of trap.

339
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,546
Wait, what's a trap!
What do you mean!

340
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,606
- A sort of bear trap!
- No!

341
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:06,379
It was not for bears, it was to mankind!

342
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:11,075
- Let me out.
- Move back, not go out.

343
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:13,648
This is very bad, man.
This is very bad.

344
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,747
- Where did you put the damn key?
- You had it.

345
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:26,931
Damn, I should have another copy.

346
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,843
What is all this shit!
Of all the damn places ...

347
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,603
had to choose just one!

348
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,719
- I know that look.
- What look?

349
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,239
Did not tell us everything
happened out there.

350
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,966
Is to see my friend bleed
out there.

351
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:51,941
So I know when you're cheating.

352
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:53,426
Not now, Amber.

353
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:58,154
It's our little game: wonder where
you've been and you invent something.

354
00:29:00,394 --> 00:29:03,090
He is a half truth because it makes
those who know how to lie.

355
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,393
You should have avoided
Part of the girl.

356
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:14,510
You have the look of when
do not say it all.

357
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,746
I am alone in this house.

358
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:30,531
There is a fucking murderer out there
and I am alone in this house.

359
00:29:36,346 --> 00:29:37,286
Hey.

360
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:45,890
Look, I may not be the groom
wonder or anything like that ...

361
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:47,740
but I will not let anything happen to you.

362
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,426
I wanted to talk alone.

363
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,093
Brent do not trust that gun.

364
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:03,091
Nena, Brent can be an idiot
arrogant at times, but ...

365
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:04,969
do not shoot us.

366
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:10,119
All I know is that left two
people and only one returned.

367
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,665
I do not know, I'm too busy thinking
in how the two of us will come of this.

368
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:20,875
- It's very bad.
- We are well screwed.

369
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:25,176
- God, I'm fucked, you're screwed ..
- Partner ...

370
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:26,538
Freddy!

371
00:30:26,844 --> 00:30:28,207
Erase from your mind.

372
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,814
Come sit here.

373
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:38,084
We are well screwed.

374
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:47,700
Freddy, we could die tonight, well
why do not we go to fourth y. ..

375
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:50,398
we get to work?

376
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:52,929
Maybe it's our last chance.

377
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:56,188
Really?

378
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,700
No, but at least I made you think
something else.

379
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,699
Relax.

380
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,301
Want to know what's what
I told them not to others?

381
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:14,033
Sank my boat.

382
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:19,909
I think he put the gun because
wants you to use.

383
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:22,872
As Nicole.

384
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:26,327
Maybe.

385
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:34,086
Who cares?

386
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:38,024
We'll sit in a corner,
away from windows ...

387
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:41,173
and if that damn patient falls,
I killed him.

388
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:46,808
Promise you will not let it
nothing bad happens to me.

389
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:48,927
Of course.

390
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:59,012
Within a month, we'll be drinking
to pass out in shawns Rock.

391
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:40,231
How can you be reading?

392
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:44,056
I try to think of anything else and unless
you want to go out there ...

393
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:47,448
and find out how to get out of here
this is the best I can do.

394
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:59,532
Why are they all so calm?

395
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:02,015
Could they all leave
break my things?

396
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,652
"We sat
waiting to kill us!

397
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:06,385
- Freddy, you have to calm down.
- Do not even know if it is outside.

398
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,499
Yeah, sure, Barbie, do not you see that we
being manipulated like puppets?

399
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:13,134
If we stay here, we all die.
We must get to the truck.

400
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,317
- And we have to leave here.
- Yes

401
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:17,951
Yes, and the guy who sent us the
creepy video ...

402
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:21,017
sure did not do anything to the truck.
- At least we must try.

403
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,168
We're staying seated
so quietly!

404
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,622
- It's okay to feel afraid.
- Freddy, we're with you.

405
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:30,770
No, no, I gotta go.
I gotta get outta here.

406
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,165
Yes, as if you were to go.
Sit!

407
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:36,350
- You're scaring the chicks.
- Hey, listen.

408
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,808
Our best chance
we hold together.

409
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:43,293
- No, we must leave here.
- Freddy, that's what he wants.

410
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:46,443
He wants me to go into panic.
You have a panic attack at me.

411
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:47,898
- No.
- Breathe.

412
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:49,625
No, I can breathe.
Let me go.

413
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:52,835
Oh my God!

414
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,411
Are you out there!
Are you out there!

415
00:34:58,244 --> 00:35:00,938
- He must have brought.
- This is really screwed.

416
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,237
- You said she was dying.
- Leave me alone.

417
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:11,327
- What happened at the berth?
- I thought he was dead.

418
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:13,571
I am not a doctor, dammit.

419
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:20,064
We have to take him to a hospital
now.

420
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:21,313
Sure, call an ambulance.

421
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:25,188
- What is it?
- Do you think it will survive if we leave?

422
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,763
Guys, if we're not
now, die!

423
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:30,596
- Guys ...
- I assure you that this crazy ...

424
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,382
wants us to go to the truck, is
the first thing that occurred to him.

425
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:36,352
Brent, If I carry myself,
give me the gun?

426
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:38,775
- No way.
- Fuck you.

427
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:46,657
Brent left me.

428
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:48,415
Did he say anything?

429
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:52,654
Baby, what happens?

430
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:10,360
Shit!

431
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,572
Jennifer, what's up!

432
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:15,601
- Carlos says Brent abandoned him.
- Of course, I thought he was dead.

433
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:17,540
Shit!

434
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,473
If someone wants to stay until
morning, you can.

435
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:25,017
Jennifer and I took Charles to
hospital because otherwise die.

436
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:27,507
And if you do not like it, fuck you.

437
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:29,081
I'm going.

438
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,904
I'll get the truck.

439
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,908
Stationarity against the portal,
but I will not without the gun.

440
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:38,515
No, if you give the gun not return ...

441
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,119
and be a pile of corpses.
- Brent is right, we think.

442
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:46,220
- No time. Good luck.
- Thanks.

443
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:48,946
Take care.

444
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:10,918
When she returns, you take the gun
Charles and I, okay?

445
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:16,097
Well, smartass, we will sit here
expected to turn the keys ...

446
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:18,369
of the van and all listen
and walks away.

447
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,307
Goodbye sister, farewell gun.

448
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,727
Help me, I will argue for
you by the arms and legs.

449
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,757
- Careful.
- Mikey.

450
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:43,513
- Do you really believe that's a good idea?
- I do not see you die.

451
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:46,934
Well, but you will be responsible
they kill us all.

452
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,199
Are not you coming?

453
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:47,956
Hurry.

454
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:50,926
Careful.

455
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:57,758
Brent.

456
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,969
Come on!

457
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,221
Do not fall asleep.

458
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,502
- What will we?
- Do not know.

459
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,566
- You have to start it.
- I'm doing!

460
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:50,988
- I'm trying!
- I told you!

461
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:53,774
Fuck it.

462
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,011
Now they're hanging from a rope.

463
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,856
Are escalating at a time
and the next seeing certain death.

464
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:12,429
The hook was giving because
I could not bear the weight of all.

465
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:15,944
I was closest to the top.

466
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,915
Shall I get the knife from my belt?

467
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:22,101
I cut the rope and they fall?

468
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:30,097
I looked down and all
was so quiet, so perfect.

469
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:33,882
And then I cut.

470
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:39,167
One by one their cries faded.

471
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:41,561
Hers was the last to
left to hear.

472
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:44,767
And I survived.

473
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,313
I had ten seconds to decide.

474
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,615
You have until 6:00 a. m

475
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:53,170
Right now they have to
sacrifice someone

476
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:57,771
Send a person
outside. They have 60 seconds

477
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:06,208
Crap!

478
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:08,643
What the hell!

479
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,289
- It gasoline
-50 Seconds

480
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:20,009
- Leave us alone!
- Give me that damn gun right now!

481
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,477
- Calm down!
- Damn!

482
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:24,300
Stop fighting!

483
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,354
Okay, I'll shoot for
outside. Everybody ran towards the trees

484
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:29,774
- Go in different directions
- We will die if we tried that

485
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,722
40 seconds

486
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,913
To hell with this

487
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:36,211
- Do not even move
- He's dead

488
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:39,727
We're going to burn, dammit! Everyone!

489
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:41,448
Anyway kill us!

490
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:43,502
No, no, it will

491
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:45,254
If we do this for him, he will not

492
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:47,215
30 seconds

493
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,547
He has lost too much blood

494
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:05,684
Look, Michael. Gonna die

495
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,622
- Do not talk about it, damn it!
- Look at her!

496
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,211
-20 Seconds
- Love

497
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,121
15 seconds

498
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:55,994
To hell with this! No!

499
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:59,623
Mikey

500
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:02,811
Run! Run!

501
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:16,657
We are taught to bury

502
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,427
but primary

503
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:23,623
Basically, we are all murderers

504
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:25,418
I tried to tell them, guys

505
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,378
He planned it all

506
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,422
This truck, pistol, all

507
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,792
Do you think we going to let live?

508
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:38,209
Stop talking as if
knew the fucking guy

509
00:43:38,536 --> 00:43:41,319
- Stop talking like that!
- Are you going to shoot?

510
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:48,612
- You going to shoot?
- I will not shoot you, you bastard

511
00:43:57,157 --> 00:44:00,688
I will run, if not trigger follow me

512
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:21,433
Do not leave me

513
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,084
Wait! No!

514
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:32,824
Okay, grab the gun
and returns. See you there

515
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:37,137
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

516
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:55,768
- Come on!
- Dale!

517
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:23,090
Freddy opens the door!
Freddy opens the door!

518
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:25,006
- Freddy, go!
- Open the door!

519
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,019
Freddy, go!

520
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:29,162
Come in, come

521
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,367
Please, please

522
00:45:47,665 --> 00:45:49,398
There is no escape

523
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,204
Only the choice of dying with your friends

524
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:54,008
or survive on your own

525
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,255
Decides

526
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,773
- Charles died?
- Was the only option

527
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:18,009
- Where is Alex?
- The shooter shot

528
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:21,675
- And Brent?
- I left

529
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:41,991
Fuck you!

530
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:44,967
You are a piece of shit!

531
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:27,246
See? Did you see?!

532
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,933
- What can we do?
- Do not know

533
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:54,012
But we must stick together

534
00:48:01,238 --> 00:48:02,856
Why do not we?

535
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,146
We are monitoring all

536
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:08,148
You know we can do

537
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:12,622
What will happen at 6
point? Have you considered that?

538
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:15,222
We should leave now

539
00:48:15,735 --> 00:48:18,552
We have a weapon. No
I will let anything happen to us.

540
00:48:18,872 --> 00:48:20,521
Just try to calm down

541
00:48:27,954 --> 00:48:29,551
Give me that

542
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:38,368
You know? For as you looked before
I thought you played before me

543
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:44,750
- What?
- We are alone

544
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:48,691
And so we die

545
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:58,400
Outside there's a guy making us
kill each other

546
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:02,430
Inside ...

547
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:07,050
.. Our friend Michael has a gun

548
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:16,831
It is the best man I ever met

549
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,125
And it is exactly why
which I know they both die

550
00:49:24,301 --> 00:49:25,931
It makes no sense what you say

551
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,385
If you have to make a decision "to
choose who you think Michael?

552
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:36,654
I prefer to Jen before me
Do you really think you will choose?

553
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,844
And would choose Jen over himself

554
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,912
That love will kill us both

555
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,880
Do not say that!

556
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:29,424
Freddy, you are sitting
beside an open window

557
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,402
He speaks softly

558
00:50:48,164 --> 00:50:50,892
- I thought we had left
- Never leave my crew

559
00:50:51,788 --> 00:50:53,511
Especially after
I found a way out

560
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,067
- What?
- The boat

561
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,083
- Probably also broke
- I checked

562
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:04,073
All he did was take the keys

563
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,300
but I have an extra copy

564
00:51:05,578 --> 00:51:07,536
- And he must not know
- Well, I'm going to tell Michael ...

565
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:09,639
No time for group discussion

566
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:12,136
We must act

567
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:16,003
Why not?!

568
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,043
Did you see how it is
Michael behaving?

569
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,056
He has the gun and sends

570
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,941
- What if I do not want to go?
- Yes, but if we say on the boat ...

571
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,757
We can not risk

572
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:29,603
While you have the weapon,
makes all decisions

573
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,723
- I will not leave
- We will not let anyone

574
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:39,289
Everyone goes. We only need
weapon for the last word

575
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:40,786
That's all

576
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,341
Jen did not trust me

577
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:47,610
This means that
Mikey does not trust me

578
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,229
I can not get close enough to the weapon

579
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,990
but they trust you, Freddy

580
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:00,065
Everyone in this house need your help

581
00:52:00,374 --> 00:52:02,219
You said it yourself. If
we stay, we die

582
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,694
- I can
- Yes you can

583
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:10,110
I really can not

584
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,935
You want to live?

585
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:19,415
You want to live?

586
00:52:30,276 --> 00:52:31,727
Amber Where is Freddy?

587
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,356
- It wants to be alone
- Mikey

588
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:52,102
Remember ... the first year?

589
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,433
"Those guys who made fun of me?

590
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,950
You defended me

591
00:53:00,022 --> 00:53:03,186
And you knew you were
my roommate

592
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,207
I do remember

593
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,007
I just ...

594
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,200
I wanted you to know that I appreciate that

595
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:22,792
Listen, friend

596
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:26,175
We will not say goodbye yeah?

597
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:31,947
I'm so sorry

598
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:39,345
- That's
- Stand, Amber

599
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:40,827
That is, give it to me

600
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:42,765
Give me the gun!

601
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:46,190
- Now, Freddy!
- Do not give the gun

602
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,603
No, I have the gun. I will go to pot

603
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,425
Brent told me that the boat sank

604
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:53,750
- What I said is that ...
- Was it a lie?!

605
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:56,333
- Look, Freddy
- I said no!

606
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:08,599
- I am so scared
- I know that yes, friend

607
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:10,406
We're all scared, man

608
00:54:10,684 --> 00:54:12,351
This is not the way

609
00:54:13,804 --> 00:54:17,499
Fuck! Fuck me!

610
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:23,815
Fuck me!
Movieras told you!

611
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,243
Do you know why am I here?

612
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:28,805
Because I scholarship
with you in first year

613
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:33,702
If that had not happened,
parties would have made me!

614
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,301
That's not true! And you know

615
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:39,189
We're repeating this for
convince you to do this

616
00:54:39,497 --> 00:54:40,601
Detente

617
00:54:41,694 --> 00:54:43,033
What happens when morning comes?

618
00:54:43,963 --> 00:54:46,934
What if you have
choose between us and Jennifer?

619
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:51,416
- You know that will not happen
- That was not what I said!

620
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,146
I said what if ...

621
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:57,874
What if that happens?

622
00:54:58,123 --> 00:54:59,749
So, Freddy. So do not
can make decisions

623
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:01,513
- Now give me the gun
- Please!

624
00:55:01,772 --> 00:55:03,784
As if he knew that
going to shoot us all!

625
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,294
What are you talking about?

626
00:55:05,573 --> 00:55:09,002
Just because you do not sing a Margot
mean you're smart

627
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:11,643
It is a reality, you're a fucking murderer!

628
00:55:13,107 --> 00:55:15,448
I could have gone. But I am back for you

629
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:17,220
Now give me the gun

630
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,870
Give me the gun, fat bastard!

631
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:31,344
How did you feel last week?

632
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:36,220
- What?
- Come on! You know what I mean

633
00:55:36,479 --> 00:55:38,139
Let How did you feel?

634
00:55:38,398 --> 00:55:40,994
- What are you talking about?
- I bet you do not even know your name

635
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,974
But you had right?

636
00:55:45,284 --> 00:55:47,988
Of course for everyone to know

637
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:51,205
that are stronger and I am weak

638
00:55:52,045 --> 00:55:53,181
By God! Give me the gun

639
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,357
How do you feel now?

640
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:59,346
Do you feel weak? Do you feel insecure?

641
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:04,647
As the bloody fat! Fuck you!

642
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:06,657
What you gonna do, eh?

643
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:10,027
- Are you going to kill us all, Freddy?
- No, rude boy, only you!

644
00:56:23,186 --> 00:56:25,386
Freddy, do not shoot

645
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:27,931
Come on, man. Dale, just go

646
00:56:29,713 --> 00:56:32,317
- Just get out okay?
- God, Freddy!

647
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,532
When dawn will be the only
here with the gun do you hear?

648
00:56:38,748 --> 00:56:40,134
Just me and the gun!

649
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:42,896
Now go

650
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:47,597
If you force us to leave, is
as if we shot yourself

651
00:56:48,423 --> 00:56:51,288
- Do not want to die, old
- I know not

652
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,229
Love, okay. Okay

653
00:56:59,505 --> 00:57:02,439
Freddy not shoot us
because Freddy is our friend

654
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:05,120
Charles also was our friend!

655
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:10,283
Go away!

656
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:16,669
- Down
- Out!

657
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,168
You said it yourself

658
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,783
We are alone

659
00:57:31,206 --> 00:57:32,465
What I said is that ...

660
00:57:33,043 --> 00:57:35,000
... both going to die

661
00:57:44,312 --> 00:57:46,534
I want you, Mikey!

662
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,008
I want you

663
00:57:52,765 --> 00:57:54,943
If you want us to leave,
have to come and shoot

664
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:59,078
Please, please just go away!

665
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,470
Come, look me in the eyes
and pulls the trigger

666
00:58:13,132 --> 00:58:16,357
- Love, not
- OK

667
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:28,884
You're like a brother to me

668
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,582
And right now you
altered. We all are

669
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,168
That's not the way

670
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,664
So, Freddy

671
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,449
Okay

672
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:36,652
I told you to give me
the gun, fat bastard

673
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:48,411
Go forth now, and let you live

674
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:51,027
But if you do ...

675
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:55,129
... will come for you

676
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:03,238
Is there light here?

677
01:00:07,216 --> 01:00:08,863
Find it

678
01:00:10,265 --> 01:00:11,657
Damn!

679
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:19,178
Over there

680
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:33,305
Okay, when we leave
run and never look back will you?

681
01:00:33,606 --> 01:00:35,193
You run up to the motorcycle

682
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,278
Let

683
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:15,328
All right, stay down

684
01:01:16,316 --> 01:01:17,975
Wait till you get closer to exit

685
01:02:12,044 --> 01:02:13,448
Oh God!

686
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,101
- You can do this
- It's the only way, brother

687
01:02:19,996 --> 01:02:21,655
This is about survival

688
01:02:21,945 --> 01:02:23,800
At least give us the
opportunity to say goodbye

689
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,470
- You owe me
- You are my partner

690
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:29,748
I regret that you
to die like this, but ...

691
01:02:29,986 --> 01:02:32,949
I'm like you, narcissistic moron!

692
01:02:33,194 --> 01:02:34,775
They have 10 seconds

693
01:02:39,806 --> 01:02:41,211
I'm going to pounce

694
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,273
- We will kill
- If you have opportunity,

695
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,904
grab the gun

696
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:52,145
Sorry, really sorry

697
01:03:03,286 --> 01:03:05,205
Trompe this, bastard!

698
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:23,280
Jesus!

699
01:03:31,203 --> 01:03:32,626
Are you okay?

700
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:51,527
- Let
- Amber, we

701
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,257
Let

702
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:13,968
- It's fucked!
- Do not look

703
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:16,145
- What can we do?
- It's almost 6

704
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,309
We return to the
corner with the gun. Let

705
01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:22,291
That is not working What about Amber?

706
01:04:22,837 --> 01:04:24,484
What about her? I do not think
to be out of that basement

707
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:26,941
What if it does? What will we do, shoot?

708
01:04:28,366 --> 01:04:31,449
- What!
- Did you see what he did to Brent?

709
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:34,580
- I saw it save our lives. Yes ..
- We can rely more on it!

710
01:04:37,472 --> 01:04:39,163
He can not stop bullets OK?

711
01:04:39,383 --> 01:04:40,498
What we do
is returning to the corner

712
01:04:40,736 --> 01:04:42,365
It is our best chance.
Going into a corner

713
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:43,871
and expect to come to us

714
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,561
You're not listening!

715
01:04:46,057 --> 01:04:47,213
We have to flee

716
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:49,065
You saw what happened to
Alex when he tried

717
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:51,489
That guy is out there. Love,
can see what we are doing

718
01:04:51,748 --> 01:04:53,120
- You can not stay here!
- Please, Jen

719
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:57,336
- If we go, we die
- If we stay here, we die!

720
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,119
... use this

721
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:26,176
- Michael, down!
- What the hell are you doing?

722
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:27,876
- Where'd you get that weapon?
- I found

723
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:31,392
- What do you mean you find her?
- I found

724
01:05:31,652 --> 01:05:32,775
Remain calm the two

725
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:35,478
You were pointing to Michael, bring it down

726
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:37,890
Low yours

727
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:40,705
Do not shoot him. It is the only
why I came back

728
01:05:40,963 --> 01:05:43,871
Put your guns down two.
Put your guns down the two!

729
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:49,604
All pretend that's not true,
but everyone knows that I love

730
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:52,142
So I'm screwed
taking so many pills

731
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:54,058
It's not my fault that I love

732
01:05:55,102 --> 01:05:56,835
This is no time for this

733
01:05:59,653 --> 01:06:02,231
I love you and I know I messed up

734
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:06,747
but is torture
see you with someone else

735
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:09,472
Put it down

736
01:06:09,802 --> 01:06:11,287
Jennifer, she did not shoot us only ...

737
01:06:17,452 --> 01:06:20,162
Put the gun down and then talk

738
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:28,801
I know you love me too

739
01:06:29,636 --> 01:06:31,758
- Since when? In first year?
- Jennifer!

740
01:06:31,997 --> 01:06:34,026
Do you think you have
with him is so special?

741
01:06:34,297 --> 01:06:35,791
Not true

742
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:41,415
If you really loved not
you had secrets from me

743
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:45,929
What are you talking about,
last summer?

744
01:06:48,402 --> 01:06:50,443
He confessed the next day

745
01:06:52,082 --> 01:06:55,095
We overcame. He does not love you, Amber

746
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:03,780
- Give me the gun, Amber
- Amber, do not

747
01:07:07,763 --> 01:07:10,388
- Give me the gun
- I guess that is the end then

748
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,731
Amber, put the gun

749
01:07:16,443 --> 01:07:18,383
She is the girl
that boys marry

750
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,547
and I'm the girl who
the boys singen!

751
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:26,161
God

752
01:07:38,038 --> 01:07:39,544
Oh, God

753
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:42,520
I had to do it right?

754
01:07:44,823 --> 01:07:46,378
I was going to shoot

755
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:53,373
- What are you doing?
- I was there!

756
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,061
The basement

757
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,466
Go, Michael

758
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:37,943
Go, Michael

759
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:42,529
Should not be here.
Should not be here

760
01:08:42,778 --> 01:08:44,372
We still have a chance and she did not

761
01:08:46,684 --> 01:08:48,456
She is the one more chance

762
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:51,653
Stay behind me

763
01:08:55,434 --> 01:08:57,409
- Shoot
- We have to wait

764
01:08:59,658 --> 01:09:01,711
- Shoot
- Keep approaching you, you bastard

765
01:09:03,115 --> 01:09:04,909
Keep getting close

766
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,476
You gave

767
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,698
God!

768
01:09:27,257 --> 01:09:29,732
Love, we gotta go.
We gotta go, go

769
01:09:35,831 --> 01:09:37,922
Jen, I need your
help. I need your help

770
01:09:38,985 --> 01:09:40,729
No time for this

771
01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:55,742
- Jen, listen
- It's going to kill us

772
01:09:57,311 --> 01:10:00,715
Never happen, you can not touch us

773
01:10:03,635 --> 01:10:04,747
Look ...

774
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:35,710
- I'd kill for you
- Is the only way

775
01:12:20,345 --> 01:12:22,104
I loved you so much

776
01:12:23,788 --> 01:12:25,871
And could not even realize

777
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,626
Yes I did

778
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,895
I'm so sorry

779
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,590
Stop!

780
01:13:37,661 --> 01:13:39,564
End, sick bastard

781
01:13:40,202 --> 01:13:42,128
It's finished

782
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:45,097
We did go through
all this to prove something

783
01:13:45,911 --> 01:13:48,365
But I never considered a thing

784
01:13:51,149 --> 01:13:53,490
Were you crazy before
cut that rope

785
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,686
And guess what?

786
01:13:56,993 --> 01:14:01,005
Never ... I seem to you

787
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:08,842
We'll see

788
01:14:28,408 --> 01:14:30,028
Speech by Dr. Karl Truftin

789
01:14:30,274 --> 01:14:31,823
He has contacted my office

790
01:14:32,265 --> 01:14:35,481
- Leave the message
- Hello, Doctor

791
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,763
I want to talk with you in person

792
01:14:39,052 --> 01:14:40,701
I have a new chapter for his book

793
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:43,690
Remember when you forced me to say

794
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:46,383
others would not take the
same choice I made?

795
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:51,498
He was wrong, and I proved my theory

796
01:14:54,519 --> 01:14:57,796
Do you know what it's called, Doctor?

797
01:14:58,168 --> 01:15:00,076
Close
