526
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,806

Their coffins were pried open,

546
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:55,232

gathered around.

in the ground for two months.

The others had been
buried longer.

550
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,324
Because her body
was in better condition

551
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:06,243
than the others,
it was decided that

552
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,870
- Mercy was the vampire
- (SCREAMING)

was ripped out of her body,

staked in front of the camera,

556
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,673

when he asked me about it.

Which means I also knew
better than to say so.

to regulate your moods
