1
00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:04,694
(police radio
transmits indistinctly)

2
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,319
- All right, Jimenes,

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,139
Would you rather wake up

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,249
every morning - - Already?

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,019
You wanna start
with that already?

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,870
- It's just a way
to get to know you.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,023
See what type of man you are.

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,549
So would you rather
wake up with cabbage,

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,871
two big things of cabbage
on your hands every morning

10
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:51,705
and you have to eat 'em all

11
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,583
before you can even
start your day?

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,329
Or would you rather
have a little midget

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,669
that follows you around
but fucks with you,

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,059
like turns out the lights
when you're taking a shower

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,819
or mismatches your socks,
locks your keys in your car

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,109
when you're not
paying attention.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,110
Which one?

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,252
- I will say I
fucking hate cabbage.

19
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:13,709
I don't like cabbage.

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,359
It's gross.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,979
Little Midget,

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,999
I feel like I already
had that shit,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,739
'cause that shit always
happens to me, man.

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,912
So think I'll do the midget.

25
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:23,612
- All right.
- Yeah, I'll settle with that.

26
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,233
- That was an easy one,
that was an easy one.

27
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:30,027
All right, all right.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,600
Would you rather
be at San Quentin

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,680
with the craziest serial raper

30
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,276
of all time?
- But what's San Quentin?

31
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:43,499
- San Quentin?
- What is that?

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
- Really?

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,109
Like one of the worst fricking
jail or prisons on earth.

34
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,309
- Oh, okay, I was testing you,

35
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,354
I was testing you to see
if you knew what that was.

36
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:53,343
- Boy.

37
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:54,343
Oh boy.

38
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,329
Okay, would you
rather be in there

39
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,979
with like this
craziest rapist guy

40
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,409
and like once a month he's
gonna have his way with you

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,407
and there's nothing you
can do at all, like -

42
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,720
but it's only once a month.

43
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:10,109
- Okay, what's the other option?

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,110
- Or would you rather
go viral on TikTok,

45
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,399
everybody in the
world's gonna see it,

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,589
there's gonna be
memes after this,

47
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,009
you walk outside and
somebody pranks you

48
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,199
by throwing shit at your door
and it's filled with dildos

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,969
and while you're trying
to smash the shit out,

50
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,319
dildos are just
falling from the sky

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,803
and hitting you in
the face everywhere.

52
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:31,529
(Jimenes laughs)
And it goes viral.

53
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,363
Everybody's gonna see it.

54
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:33,646
- Where do you get this shit?

55
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:34,649
Is this what you're
always thinking about?

56
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,483
- Yeah.
- This is what you're

57
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:36,963
always thinking
about, wow, okay.

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,808
- Well, do you see
a lot going on?

59
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,597
- I'll go with the -

60
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,456
Fuck, man, I don't know,

61
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,649
go with dildos.

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,209
- Viral, dildos and shit
- Viral, I'll be known

63
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,824
- just smacking you.
- For the dildo guy.

64
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,105
- Okay.
- Yeah. Why not? Fuck it.

65
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,261
Fuck it.

66
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:03,262
So, being on the force
for two weeks now,

67
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,839
what do you guys normally do?

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,053
- This is it, drive around,

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,353
parking tickets,
pulling people over.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,049
I mean, it's not
a glamorous job.

71
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,059
It's not like what
you see on Cops.

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,339
There's not a bunch
of shit going on.

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,659
Nobody's really chasing us.

74
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,310
We're not really
chasing anybody.

75
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,029
I mean.

76
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,769
We'll probably pull
somebody over tonight

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,033
for something boring.

78
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,340
Who knows what that is.

79
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,939
I hope we don't
pull anybody over

80
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,725
'cause I don't feel
like doing paperwork.

81
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:41,999
(Jimenes laughs)

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,299
I'm just saying.
- I, I agree.

83
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,836
But I'm kind of excited
though, you know?

84
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,383
First, well, first stop.

85
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,247
Tired of all the
fucking office work.

86
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,383
All that desk work,
it's just, killer man.

87
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:58,283
Have you ever fallen asleep?

88
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,140
- Oh yeah, I take
naps all the time.

89
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,976
I mean, if you weren't
here, I'd probably pull

90
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,670
down one of these streets
and take a nap right now.

91
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,671
No big deal.

92
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:11,579
Now that you're here I
can take a nap all day

93
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,103
and you can just drive around.

94
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,427
(static ping)

95
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,250
- That's kinda strange,
don't you think?

96
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,123
- Text the wife.

97
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,930
You married?

98
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,189
Kids, anything?
- No.

99
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,663
No, no kids, no kids.

100
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,713
Married once though,
yeah, married once.

101
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,993
- Really?
- Yeah.

102
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:42,798
- How did that go?

103
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:47,108
- Huh? Not married anymore.

104
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,959
(both chuckle)

105
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,855
- Yeah, I've been married
for about five years now.

106
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:52,689
- Kids?

107
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,497
- Yeah, I got two kids, but I
mean, it's a bunch of babies.

108
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,789
- I bet that's awesome,
though, man, to have kids?

109
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,279
- It's cool, I mean, the
wife hates me being a cop.

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,617
She wants me to do a
safer job, I'm like,

111
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,600
(Jimenes chuckles)

112
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,949
This seems pretty safe, right?

113
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,153
- Pretty safe, yeah.

114
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,897
She's just asking like,
"How's your partner?"

115
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,049
(Jimenes chuckles)

116
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,739
- So have you had a
partner before or?

117
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,239
- Yeah, I mean, they
usually choose me

118
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,349
to do on-the-job training.

119
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,350
- Got you.

120
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,800
- Apparently I have a knack

121
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,753
for walking the
new guys through.

122
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,470
Not too bad.

123
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,560
- So this is it, huh?

124
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,790
- Nobody's speeding, you
can't make 'em speed.

125
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,375
You hungry?

126
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,209
- I am hungry, actually.

127
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,547
- All right, where are we?

128
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,929
No speedsters today.

129
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,819
Lunchtime.

130
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,027
Even though we've only
been on duty for two hours.

131
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:12,828
(Jimenes chuckles)
But I am hungry.

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,469
- [Server] Jimmy's, how
can I get you started?

133
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,773
- Can, let me ask you, does the
number one come with onions?

134
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:34,542
- [Server] You said a number
one combo with medium fries?

135
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:38,124
- No, I said does the
number one come with onions?

136
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,126
- [Server] Oh, a number
one with a slushie?

137
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,366
- No, does it come with onions?

138
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,100
- [Server] Oh, number one with
no onions, I'm so sorry sir.

139
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:46,101
- Oh my god.

140
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,349
- Hold on one second.

141
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,269
- I'm sorry, can you hear me?

142
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,679
- [Server] Kinda, can you
speak up a little bit louder?

143
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm so sorry.

144
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,283
- Does the number, sorry,

145
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,333
does the number one
come with onions?

146
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:02,759
- [Server] Does the number
one come with onions?

147
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,593
- Yes.

148
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:05,854
- [Server] Yeah, do you
want me to take it off?

149
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:08,769
- Yeah, let's take
off the onions.

150
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,973
- [Server] Okay.
- Does it come with lettuce?

151
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,209
- What, are you kidding me?

152
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,072
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:17,906
- I don't know, I -

154
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:21,183
- Hey man, just give us two
number ones with Sprites.

155
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:29,597
With everything on, just two
number ones with Sprites.

156
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,930
Did you lose your mind?

157
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,859
I don't like onions, so.

158
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,039
You want them to
spit in our food?

159
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,646
(Jimenes chuckles)

160
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:39,959
Did you catch that, boss?

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,830
Except for these pictures,

162
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,670
go slide.
- Fucking hate

163
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,503
these things, man.

164
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,553
You, you comfortable
with these things on?

165
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:46,793
- No, 'cause they can
see everything I'm doing.

166
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,933
The only cool thing is if I
prop my head up like this,

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,869
you don't know if
I'm awake or asleep.

168
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,070
- Oh, that's true, yeah.

169
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:00,239
- They're just gonna
look at me. (chuckles)

170
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,626
Don't look at me, puppet.

171
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:02,999
(Jimenes chuckles)

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,529
- So, what, it's live
feed going directly

173
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,389
to like Headquarters or what?

174
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,019
- That's what I've heard.

175
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,239
I've never actually seen
where the footage goes.

176
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,289
- Oh.

177
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,089
- I don't actually care,

178
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,453
because I don't
really do anything.

179
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,813
- I mean, our - - I guess

180
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,349
if you're doing something
wrong, then worry about it.

181
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,369
- Yeah, I mean, our job is
to control the situation.

182
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,543
Don't lose your head.

183
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,339
When I was in the Marines,
that's all it is, muscle memory.

184
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,049
Everything is muscle memory.

185
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,183
You're still new, but
you'll pick it up.

186
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,679
You'll learn when and
when not to draw your gun,

187
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,903
when to use your taser.

188
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:44,819
Have you used a taser before?

189
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,404
- I have, yeah, yeah,
I did at the Academy.

190
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:51,755
I had to get my ass tased
before I could grab it. (laughs)

191
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:52,633
So yeah.
- That shit hurts, huh?

192
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,633
- Yeah.

193
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,053
I think I pissed myself.

194
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:06,629
(police radio transmitting)
- Okay.

195
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,320
Would you rather have the
worst explosive diarrhea

196
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,433
any time anybody
sneezes around you?

197
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,879
- Like the sneeze triggers

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,747
- Yeah. You hear, - Diarrhea?

199
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:19,769
- you hear somebody sneezing,

200
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,299
you're just like (mimicked
explosive sound).

201
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,043
- You know what I, okay, or?

202
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,609
- Or would you
rather get attacked

203
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,189
by a hundred hornets
once a month?

204
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,419
- Oh, fuck no.

205
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,253
Diarrhea.

206
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,703
- You like the diarrhea?
- Yeah.

207
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,613
I wasn't gonna -

208
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:36,858
I'm all over the ass play, man.

209
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:37,770
(both laugh)

210
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,120
From dildos to this.

211
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:46,474
(police radio
transmitting indistinctly)

212
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,167
- (grunts) Let's
light this dude up.

213
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:59,033
(police siren wailing)

214
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,193
Where's he going?

215
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,444
- I don't know.

216
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,970
Not sketchy at all.

217
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:11,519
- Just keep your head
on a swivel, all right?

218
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Just follow my lead.

219
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,248
- I don't like this.

220
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,707
- Oh, great.

221
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,489
(car doors unlocking)

222
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,464
- (sighs) All right.

223
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:27,465
- Hold on.

224
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,187
(Radio beeps) Dispatch.

225
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,689
Dispatch, this is 1389.

226
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,409
Car stopped, Williams
and Third, red light,

227
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,410
Nevada plates 3 1
4, Ida, Nora, David.

228
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,213
- [Dispatcher] Ten four.

229
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,570
- You good?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,906
(seat belts unbuckling)

231
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,999
(door thuds)

232
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,340
(traffic droning)

233
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,373
- [Harrison] Good
evening, sir, you know

234
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:26,789
why I pulled you over?

235
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,341
- No.

236
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,175
- No?

237
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,179
- No.
- See that red light

238
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,349
over there?

239
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,969
- No.
- On Williams? You ran it.

240
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,803
- Really?

241
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:34,740
- Yes.

242
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,240
- Wow, I thought it was green.

243
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,919
- Hey man, you put
the camera down.

244
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,753
You don't have to be filming us.

245
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:45,808
- No, no, no, I got it.

246
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,599
If I cough, you might shoot me.

247
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,806
(Jimenes chuckles)

248
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:49,640
So.
- [Harrison] No,

249
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:50,760
we're not gonna
shoot you, but yeah,

250
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,159
we did catch you on the camera.

251
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,599
- I could have
sworn it was green.

252
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,461
- Oh shit, hold on.

253
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:57,105
You know, the funny thing is
your opinion doesn't matter.

254
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,249
Can I see your driver's license

255
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,509
and registration, please.
- See, my opinion does matter.

256
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,343
Just because of color

257
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,909
doesn't mean it doesn't.
- [Jimenes] Hey, hey!

258
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,833
Hey, buddy, just
listen to him, man.

259
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,883
All right, just listen
to him, all right?

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,278
- License and
registration, please.

261
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,862
(Glove compartment clacks)

262
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:17,928
Thank you, sir.

263
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,329
Happy birthday.

264
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,689
- [Jimenes] Is it your birthday?

265
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,680
When's your birthday?

266
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:23,939
- Is this driver's
license gonna be clean

267
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,079
or is there anything
on your record

268
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,893
that you want to tell me about
right now, before I run this?

269
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,959
Yeah, I think I should say
that there's a party coming up

270
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
at my house, so.

271
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,630
- Listen, hey,

272
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,413
I think what my partner's
trying to tell you

273
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,669
is that we're gonna give
you a warning right now.

274
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,670
All right?

275
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,358
All right.

276
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,192
Here you go, sir.
- I mean,

277
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,025
I didn't do anything,
- You're good.

278
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:49,307
- But thank you.
- Have a good night, man.

279
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:50,616
Have a good one.

280
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:53,248
- [Harrison] A warning?

281
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,509
He's got a warrant for -

282
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,197
You know somebody you
freaking (indistinct).

283
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,448
- Man, I don't wanna
deal with the paperwork.

284
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,700
You taught me that, so.

285
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:08,727
- I don't have the
fucking ticket machine.

286
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:10,049
(doors thud)

287
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,069
- I don't wanna
deal with it either.

288
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,620
Fucking flashlights dying, man.

289
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:16,109
- Jesus.
- Forgot to charge it.

290
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,819
- Well, there's no
fucking charger in here,

291
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,139
so you're shit out of luck.

292
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
- Shit.

293
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:23,527
(static ping)

294
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,177
(police radio beeping)

295
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:31,199
- [Dispatcher] (breaking
up) 1389 we have a body

296
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,423
inside cart.

297
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,229
- Dispatch, what was that?

298
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,359
- [Dispatcher] 1389 we
have a PR who found a body

299
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,210
inside a shelter on
Fifth and Carter.

300
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
- Ten four.

301
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,007
So much for a quiet night.

302
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,008
- All right.

303
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,936
- I'll let you do the
paperwork on this first one,

304
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:55,457
just so you get the
hang of it, okay?

305
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,708
(police siren wailing)

306
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:09,047
We're gonna come out here
(indistinct) and were we -

307
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,416
I didn't really catch
everything you said,

308
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,066
I wasn't paying attention.

309
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,056
- Fifth and Carter.

310
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:16,238
We're right here,
actually, aren't we?

311
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,777
- Up here?
- Yeah, it's just right here.

312
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:18,861
Look at this.

313
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:25,373
- All right, let's take
this nice and easy, okay?

314
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,310
(Jimenes mumbles indistinctly)

315
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:29,311
Hmm.

316
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,181
(seat belts unbuckling)

317
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,181
Let's see what this is.

318
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,070
How you doing, sir?

319
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,903
You the one that called it in?

320
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,647
- Yeah, I'm the
one that found him.

321
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,529
- [Harrison] What
have you got for us?

322
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,799
- So I was doing my
rounds like I normally do.

323
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,200
- Okay.
- I heard a scream.

324
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,539
And there's a lot of
drama around here usually,

325
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,424
so, pretty much my intui- -
Just breathe for me, okay,

326
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,258
just breathe.

327
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,689
- Okay.
- Keep going, just relax.

328
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,799
- So I went in the building
and about 10, 15 feet in,

329
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,929
I saw a body laying there.

330
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,719
I yelled, tried to
get their attention.

331
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,549
Didn't get any response at all.

332
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,979
- Okay, can you show
me where that's at?

333
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,175
- Yeah, it's right
around over here.

334
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:16,009
- You'll walk us over there?

335
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,009
Okay, great.

336
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,879
So have you worked
here for a long time?

337
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,379
- Yeah, I've been here
for a couple years.

338
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,699
- Yeah?

339
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,979
You seen anything
like this before?

340
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,970
- Never, nothing like this.

341
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,949
It's a pretty creepy
fucking place, but.

342
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,749
- Yeah, this is, -
Never dealt with this.

343
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,909
- Place is not ideal.

344
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,469
Hopefully they pay you well?

345
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,120
- Yeah, not enough
for this shit.

346
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,983
- [Harrison] Is there anything

347
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,610
out here we should
be worried about?

348
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,549
- Nothing that I know of.

349
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,559
Just what I found in here.

350
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
- Okay.

351
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,244
- It's right around this way.

352
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,412
- Around here?

353
00:15:58,914 --> 00:15:59,910
All right, why don't
you do me a favor,

354
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:01,979
Why don't you wait
here for me, okay?

355
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,940
- Yeah, I can do that, man.

356
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,799
I seen some people a few
minutes ago running out

357
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,389
of the other side
of the building.

358
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,409
I was gonna go check that out.

359
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,243
You're cool with that?

360
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:09,629
Or stay here?
- No, stay here for me,

361
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,919
so we know where to find you,

362
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,873
just in case anything happens.

363
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:13,799
We want to know where
you're at, okay?

364
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,913
- That's fine with me, you
guys can deal with this shit.

365
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:17,414
- [Harrison] Okay.

366
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Ready?

367
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
What do you think?

368
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,900
- [Jimenes] So much
for quiet night, huh?

369
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,398
- Yeah.

370
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,809
(Jimenes chuckles)

371
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,643
- Hey, your first night

372
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:33,470
where you get to do
actual paperwork.

373
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,816
Exciting, huh?

374
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,019
Okay.

375
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,723
You wanna get the
entrance over there?

376
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,883
(footsteps crunching)

377
00:16:56,618 --> 00:17:01,618
- [Jimenes] Watch
your step, man.

378
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,207
- Yeah.

379
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:13,691
- It's fucking dark in
here man, can't see shit.

380
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:17,223
- [Harrison] I can definitely
say it's dark in here.

381
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,249
- [Jimenes] Oh man.

382
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,361
- [Harrison] What do you think?

383
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:21,540
Age before beauty?

384
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,671
- [Jimenes] Let's do it.

385
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,083
- Metro PD, anybody in here?

386
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,593
- [Jimenes] Metro
PD, we're coming in.

387
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,983
- Metro PD, hello hello?

388
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,513
- [Jimenes] Metro
PD, anybody in here?

389
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,183
- Metro PD.

390
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,065
(lock clangs)

391
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,695
- [Jimenes] What do
you think's in there?

392
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,369
- I don't know,
that's fucking weird.

393
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,663
- [Jimenes] Metro PD!

394
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,517
- What kind of building is this?

395
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:09,522
- [Jimenes] It's supposed to be

396
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,953
a fucking homeless shelter.

397
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,519
- Whew.

398
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,353
Smells like shit.

399
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,393
Definitely smells like
a homeless shelter.

400
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,963
Metro PD, anybody in here?

401
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,973
Metro PD, anybody in here?

402
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:01,227
- [Jimenes] Dude, it feels
fucking weird in here, man.

403
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,669
There's shit everywhere.

404
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,169
- Hey, man, just keep
your head on a swivel.

405
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,693
Just keep moving
forward, all right?

406
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,766
- [Jimenes] This
doesn't feel right, man.

407
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,597
- You see all these
cameras everywhere?

408
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:34,409
- [Jimenes] Yeah,
that's fucking weird.

409
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,410
- [Harrison] Where
do these even go to?

410
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,019
Hey, sir!

411
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,789
Hey, Metro PD!

412
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,333
Hey, you wanna come over here
and talk to us for a second?

413
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,693
Sir, can you come talk to
us for a second, please?

414
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,869
Hey, hey, man, let's call
this in, call this in.

415
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,979
- [Jimenes] Dispatch, we
came across a Caucasian male.

416
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,813
- [Dispatcher] Ten four.

417
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:02,604
- [Harrison] Metro PD, sir,
can you come and talk to us

418
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,688
for a second?

419
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,834
- [Jimenes] Dude, I
can't even see him.

420
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:08,002
Where'd he go?

421
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,153
Did we lose him?

422
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,363
- Hello, sir?

423
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,654
- [Jimenes] Oh, this
doesn't look creepy at all.

424
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:40,885
- Oh, that's (laughs nervously)

425
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:42,487
Oh, that's my shadow.

426
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,688
- [Jimenes] (chuckles
nervously) Okay. Okay.

427
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,089
And this room isn't
creepy at all, huh?

428
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,780
Now what is this place? Is it -

429
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,023
No lights whatsoever.

430
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,173
- [Harrison] Well, we got
creepy door number one,

431
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,349
number two, or number three.

432
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,312
Which one do you wanna take?

433
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:16,980
- [Jimenes] Oh, man.

434
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:21,449
Dude, I don't even
know how to get back

435
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,153
to where we came from, man.

436
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,983
- I don't know
where that guy went.

437
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,669
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

438
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,619
- Hey, hey ma'am.

439
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,819
Hey, we're with Metro PD.

440
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,270
We're here to help you, okay?

441
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,163
Ma'am, are you hurt?

442
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:58,971
Ma'am? (woman screams)

443
00:21:58,972 --> 00:21:59,972
Hey, calm -

444
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,313
Ma'am! Hey, calm down.

445
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,083
Hey, wait.

446
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,460
- [Jimenes] What was that, man?

447
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,863
The fuck was that?

448
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:12,559
- [Harrison] Okay, okay, okay.

449
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,566
Okay, wait, okay, you know what?

450
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,647
Let's -

451
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,639
- [Dispatcher] 1389,
what's going on?

452
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,399
- [Jimenes] Dispatch,
we lost the man,

453
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,939
we came across a woman.

454
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,119
Caucasian female,
looked like she was, -

455
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,369
she had some blood on her face.

456
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,009
- Fuck, what in
the hell was that?

457
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,269
Oh, I don't like this, man.

458
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,559
I don't like this at all.

459
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,788
- [Jimenes] Dude, what
the fuck was that?

460
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,139
Fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

461
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,473
(indistinct whispering)

462
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,970
Oh fuck.

463
00:22:41,971 --> 00:22:43,627
- [Harrison] What?

464
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,707
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

465
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,541
- [Harrison] What?

466
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,357
- We've got the body
in the next room.

467
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,799
- [Harrison] What? No no no.

468
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,813
Where? Fuck.

469
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,443
Fuck. Okay.

470
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,999
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
come on, let's go.

471
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,679
Come on, come on.

472
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,199
- [Jimenes] Sir, sir?

473
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,433
Hey, can you hear me?

474
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,228
Hey, hey, who did this to you?

475
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,476
- Dispatch, come in, over.
- Who did this to you?

476
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:13,706
Can you tell me who
did this to you?

477
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:14,846
- [Harrison] Dispatch,
come in, over.

478
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:17,039
We're gonna need
ambulance, EMS, paramedics,

479
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,499
all that good stuff.

480
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Dispatch?

481
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,519
Dispatch, come in, over.

482
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,169
Dispatch, we need paramedics.

483
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,170
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

484
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,069
- What?
- Dude, he has like -

485
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,720
Something's on a skin.

486
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,189
- What the fuck?
- Did this woman do this

487
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,023
to you?

488
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,637
- [Harrison] Dispatch, come in.

489
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:35,600

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,433
- [Harrison] We have to, we -

491
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:38,849
(Loud bang)

492
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,440
- [Jimenes] We're
gonna have to -

493
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,274
- [Harrison] We're have to move.

494
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:42,107
We're gonna have to move.

495
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:42,940
Get him up, get him up.
- We're gonna get you out,

496
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,249
okay, you have to work

497
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,419
Come on.

498
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,070
- You got him? You good?

499
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,849

507
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:08,109
- Did you hear that?

508
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:13,979
(door creaking, low groaning)

509
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,880
- [Jimenes] Okay, fuck this.

510
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:16,319

511
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,629

512
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,573
- Metro PD! Is
anybody out there?

513
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,200
- [Jimenes] Dude, I
don't fucking know

514
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,033
where you're going, man.

515
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,473
- I, look, there's that camera.

516
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,139
Okay, let's go -

Okay, let's get the

522
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,788

You okay? You good?

523
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,706
Come on, man, we

(person screams)

526
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,875
- What the fuck is going on?
- What the fuck was that?

527
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,459
- [Victim] Go back.

528
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,999
You guys, the door,
the door right here.

529
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
Right here!
- It's right there!

530
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,797
- What the fuck?
(Door thudding)

531
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:19,827
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

532
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,711
(door thuds)
- [Victim] Just go back.

533
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:22,545
- What the fuck
is going on, man?

534
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:24,746
- [Harrison] Put him down
here, put him down right here.

535
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,309
- [Jimenes] You
good right there.

536
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,889
(door thuds)

537
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,269
- Who locked these
fucking doors?

538
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,453
God damn it, who locked
these fucking doors?

539
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,083
Yeah?

540
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:37,883
- [Harrison] Dispatch.
Come in, over.

541
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,743
- [Jimenes] Hey, can you
tell me what happened?

542
00:25:39,743 --> 00:25:40,743
Who did this to you?

543
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,516
- Dispatch. Anybody copy?

544
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:46,949
We need EMS, we need backup.

545
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,159
Anybody, come in, over.

546
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,917
Paramedics, we need ambulance.

547
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:54,117
We need backup now.
- You're gonna die in here.

548
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:57,234
- [Harrison] Cell phones,
cell phones, cell phones.

549
00:25:57,235 --> 00:25:58,168
Fuck.

550
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:00,067
What the fuck?

551
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:02,039
How in the heaven do we have
no fucking services in here?

552
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,858
Fuck!
- Wait wait wait wait what?

553
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,276
- You're gonna die in here.

554
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:06,745
- [Harrison] What'd he say?

555
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:08,377
- You're gonna die in here.

556
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:09,899
- [Harrison] What'd he say?

557
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,098
- We need to get the
fuck outta here, man.

558
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,197
- We gotta keep moving.

559
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,506
We're gonna have to fucking -

560
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,573
Hey, man, you know a
fucking way outta here?

561
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:22,109
All right, are you sure?

562
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,333
- [Jimenes] What do you think?

563
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,530
- Well it's better
than just sitting here.

564
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:26,819
Hold on, come on, man.

565
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,868
You're good, right?

566
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:30,758
You okay?

567
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,877
Come on, you're all right.

568
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,277
You good?
- [Victim] Yeah.

569
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:35,587
- Hey, you got him?

570
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:36,588
All right.

571
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,946
Okay, so this way?

572
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:48,388
- It's right around the corner.

573
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,056
- [Harrison] Corner?

574
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:54,571
- [Jimenes] Okay.

575
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:59,572
- Are we going the right
way? (person screams)

576
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:06,438
- [Jimenes] Fuck, is that a -

577
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:09,689
(door bangs loudly) Oh!

578
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:12,481
The fuck was that?

579
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,178
(distant banging)

580
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,229
- [Harrison] All right,
let's just keep moving.

581
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,230
Keep your head up.

582
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:23,571
Come on, you guys good?

583
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:24,404
- Yeah.

584
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:25,645
- [Harrison] Keep moving, okay?

585
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,038
Let's bring him back here.

586
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,622
- [Jimenes] You okay, you okay?

587
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,000
- Let's sit him over here.

588
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,219
Sit him down here, let me just
check this out real quick.

589
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,629
- [Jimenes] You'll be all
right here, I'm gonna go look

590
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,919
for something.

591
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,067
He said the exit was near here.

592
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,800
- [Harrison] Okay.

593
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:53,801
Look around.

594
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,939
- [Jimenes] What the
fuck was this building

595
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,640
before it turned
into a shit hole?

596
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,922
(victim coughing)

597
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:11,811
What the fuck is
this place, man?

598
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:12,729
(victim continues coughing)

599
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,519
- [Harrison] Dude, that smell
is not getting any better.

600
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,929
It's getting fucking stronger.

601
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,779
Shit hole.
- [Jimenes] You okay?

602
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,297
Oh, fuck.

603
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,579
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

604
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,460
Okay, what the fuck?
- What's going on, hey man!

605
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,339
- [Jimenes] He's having
an seizure or something.

606
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,479
- [Harrison] Wait.
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

607
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,350
- [Harrison] Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

608
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,183
Sir, you need to calm down.

609
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:30,539
Take it easy, take it easy!

610
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,559
Sir, you good?

611
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

612
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,909
Fuck.

613
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,379
Oh, shit.

614
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Sir?

615
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,550
- [Harrison] Check his
pulse, check his pulse.

616
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

617
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,246
- What?
- He's fucking dead.

618
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:47,107
- What do you mean
he's fucking dead?

619
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:49,797
- He's fucking dead.
- What the fuck?

620
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:51,248
God, damn it.

621
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:54,218
Okay, Harrison, think,
fucking Harrison, think, okay.

622
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,219
Okay, fuck.

623
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,116
We gotta keep fucking moving,
we gotta keep fucking moving.

624
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,117
Okay think.
- Oh, shit.

625
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,827
- [Harrison] What
do we need to do?

626
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:07,249
We need to get the fuck outta
here, is what we need to do.

627
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,083
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

628
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,409
- [Harrison] Dispatch,
anybody come in, over.

629
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,410
Please.

630
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,179
- [Jimenes] Oh, fuck.

631
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:21,269
Dude, there's blood
on my fucking vest.

632
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,539
- [Harrison] There has to
be another fucking way out.

633
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,579
You know, maybe if we follow
some of these camera cables,

634
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,680
we can find a way out.

635
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:31,223
Maybe it still leads to a
security room or something.

636
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
You good?

637
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,911
Pete.

638
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:40,694
Pete!

639
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,745
- [Jimenes] What? What?

640
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:44,351
- Pete.
- [Jimenes] What?

641
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:46,184
(eater growling)

642
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,462
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?
- [Harrison] Hey, get off!

643
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:49,296
Get off! (Jimenes screaming)

644
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:52,411
(high-pitched beeping)
(heart beating rapidly)

645
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:55,316
(eater growling)
(Jimenes screaming)

646
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,979
(flashlight thudding)

647
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,563
(Jimenes breathing loudly)

648
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:03,864
Where'd you learn how
to take a fucking pulse?

649
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,219
- [Jimenes] No, shit.

650
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,180
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

651
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,739
Relax, relax.

652
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Pete!

653
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Just relax, okay?

654
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:13,350
- Yeah.
- [Harrison] Okay.

655
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:14,184
We gotta think smart.

656
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,689
We gotta get outta here.

657
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,140
- We need to just fucking go.

658
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,699
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait my, my,

659
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,319
I dropped my pistol, man.

660
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,459
I dropped my fucking pistol.

661
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,293
- [Harrison] What the fuck?

662
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:25,203
- I must have
dropped it when I was

663
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,036
in the other room walking
- Pete! Hey, come here,

664
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:26,869
- through here.
- Here, stop stop stop.

665
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,148
- We have to go
back, - Relax, relax.

666
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:31,975
- [Harrison] All
right, okay, you got -

667
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:32,809
What do you, what do you have?

668
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:33,642
You got a baton?

669
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:34,979
- I have a baton, yeah.
- You have your taser?

670
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,820
- Yeah.
- We're good, we're good,

671
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:38,339
we're good, we can't fucking
go back for that shit.

672
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,514
Somebody probably
already picked it up.

673
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:40,649
You don't want to get
shot with your own gun.

674
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,953
That'd be embarrassing, right?

675
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:42,787
- Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:44,399
- [Harrison] Just
keep breathing.

677
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,390
- We gotta go back for
my - - Let's just keep,

678
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:46,709
Let's just keep moving.

679
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,269
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's just keep moving.

680
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,103
Okay?

681
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:50,553
- Yeah.
- I got my gun.

682
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,999
I'll take the lead, let's
just keep moving, okay?

683
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,889
Just relax, okay?

684
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,890
Let's just go home.

685
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,930
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

686
00:30:59,684 --> 00:31:00,684
What the fuck was that?

687
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,952
(electronic static)

688
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:44,504
(static ping)

689
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:49,497
- Oh, man.

690
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:52,165
You almost have
to laugh about it

691
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,765
'cause it's so fucked up, right?

692
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,410
Right, Pete?

693
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:58,308
- Yeah.

694
00:31:58,309 --> 00:31:59,555
- It's pretty, man, you're good.

695
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:00,779
We're good, we're good.

696
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,180
We're gonna get outta
here, we're gonna go home.

697
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,639
All right, Pete, would
you rather have sex

698
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,989
with that diseased tranny
that we picked up last week?

699
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,790
That nasty prostitute,
you remember?

700
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,779
Or have sex with that dead guy?

701
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,130
And you have to choose one.

702
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,499
You can't kill yourself
either, you gotta choose one.

703
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,090
- Oh man, I don't know.

704
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:30,924
- I don't know, man.

705
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:33,269
- [Harrison] Come on,
man, just, let's play.

706
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,149
We play this all the time.

707
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,612
- Dude, what the fuck
was wrong with that guy?

708
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:37,560
- I don't know.
- Was a fucking animal, man.

709
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:38,960
He was trying to bite me.

710
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,629
I honestly, I've never
seen that shit before

711
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,590
in my entire life.

712
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,533
It doesn't make sense.

713
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:46,337
- Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait.

714
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,649
(low groaning)

715
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,750
What the fuck is that?

716
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,447
Wishful thinking, right?

717
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:14,509
- [Jimenes] What
the fuck is that?

718
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:21,951
- All right. (indistinct)

719
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,020
All right, cover me, okay?

720
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:24,854
I'm gonna go in.

721
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,639
- No, man, just
stay back here, man.

722
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,480
- [Harrison] Just
cover me, okay?

723
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:29,249
Just, just - - [Jimenes] Fuck.

724
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,620
- Just calm down for a second.

725
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,353
Just stare at your
friend over here.

726
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,883
Fucking camera.
- Man, just stay back.

727
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,242
- [Harrison] Relax, relax.

728
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,109
Chillax, okay?

729
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,639
We're good, we're good.

730
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Okay?

731
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
- [Jimenes] Jensen?

732
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,688
(distant noise)

733
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:42,324
- [Harrison] Oh fuck.

734
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:43,294
Oh, just breathe.

735
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,127
Just, breathe Harrison.

736
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:45,127
- [Jimenes] Jensen.

737
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,710
Jensen!

738
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,659
- [Harrison] What?

739
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,644
- [Jimenes] Jensen!
- [Harrison] What?

740
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:02,324
What?
- What are you doing in there?

741
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:04,722
- [Harrison] Nothing, nothing.

742
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:06,438
(heavy breathing)

743
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,388
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.
- [Harrison] Ma'am, Ma'am.

744
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:09,305
(woman groans)

745
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:11,658
- Hey, calm down, ma'am!
(woman continues groaning)

746
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,116
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

747
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:14,410
- [Harrison] Okay,
what's happening?

748
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:16,571
- [Jimenes] This is fucking
number two, fucking number two!

749
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,272
What the fuck, what the f-

750
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:19,157
- [Harrison] Ma'am!

751
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,574
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

752
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:22,785
(low groaning) Oh, shit.

753
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,389
What the fuck is that?

754
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,749
- Sir, sir, put your hands up.

755
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,750
Let me see 'em.

756
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:32,036
Sir?

757
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,444
- [Jimenes] Wait, Jensen.

758
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:37,057
Jensen.

759
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:37,902
- [Harrison] Did you see his -

760
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,709
- Jensen, Jensen, man, there's
something up with that man.

761
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,299
- [Harrison] Dude, he's
just fucking scared.

762
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,340
Dude was just fucking
- - No, come on.

763
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,203
- He's just fucking scared.
- Something's up with him.

764
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:47,729
- It's good, come
on, just relax.

765
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,611
- Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out!

766
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:49,444
(eater growling)

767
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:52,361
(gunshots banging)

768
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:55,082
Dude, fuck.

769
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:57,372
- Oh, fuck.

770
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:58,373
Fuck.

771
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:00,955
Did you see that (indistinct)?

772
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:03,539
Dude, he just came
fucking at me!

773
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,619
Dude, he came at me, right?

774
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,484
- [Jimenes] Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:06,317
He did, he did, he did.

776
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:07,675
- Okay.

777
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:09,029
(Harrison breathing heavily)

778
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,030
Oh, fuck.

779
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,899
That was not my fault.

780
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Oh, fuck.

781
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,003
I had to shoot, I
had no other choice.

782
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:20,258
- You're good, you're good.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!

783
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:21,299
Okay, what do we do?

784
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,964
- She's gone.
- Fuck, what?

785
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:23,947
- [Jimenes] She's gone!

786
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,117
- [Harrison] Where
the fuck is the girl?

787
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,475
What the fuck is going on?

788
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:29,499
What the fuck?

789
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,009
All right, all right,
Harrison, just relax.

790
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,139
Just think, think, think, think.

791
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,040
We gotta get a fucking
way outta here.

792
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:40,078
(floorboards creaking)

793
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,556
- What the fuck?
- What is that, man?

794
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:44,357
Should we just go
back the way we came?

795
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:48,837
- [Jimenes] How the fuck do
you know where to go back, man?

796
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:56,939
(indistinct whispering)

797
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,643
- [Harrison]
Dispatch, do you copy?

798
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,729
Dispatch!

799
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,306
You think he's actually dead?

800
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:05,803
- [Jimenes] Oh man,

801
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:07,553
I don't know what the
fuck is going on, man.

802
00:37:08,414 --> 00:37:10,403
- Must have put three
rounds in that guy.

803
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:14,579
(distant rattling)

804
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,080
(static ping)

805
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:20,109
Hey, Jimenes, you smell that?

806
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,584
- Yeah.

807
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:23,627
Yeah, what is that?

808
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,045
Smells like shit.

809
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,159
- [Harrison] Jimenes, hey.
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

810
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,869
- [Harrison] Hey, we got a body.

811
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,339
Ma'am?
- Ma'am?

812
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,983
Oh shit she looks fucking
sick or something.

813
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,043
What's wrong with her?

814
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:53,694
- [Harrison] She's
not breathing.

815
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:59,595
I don't think there's anything
else we can do for her now.

816
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,013
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

817
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,501
Jesus.

818
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:14,882
- [Harrison] Jimenes!

819
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:15,966
Hey, come on.

820
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,439
Hey, we gotta stick
together, man.

821
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,179
I don't go home, you
don't go home, all right?

822
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,180
Let's go.

823
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,410
Get the fuck outta here.

824
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:30,276
(zipper whirring)

825
00:38:30,277 --> 00:38:32,609
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait wait.

826
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,790
- [Harrison] You hear something?

827
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,259
- [Jimenes] I thought
I heard something.

828
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,573
- Come on, let's keep going.

829
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:46,498
- [Jimenes] Ah, fuck.

830
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:47,499
Oh, fuck.

831
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:53,163
- Dispatch, dispatch,
come in, over.

832
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Dispatch, you there?

833
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,743
- Fuck.
- Dispatch?

834
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:03,933
Hey, dispatch, hey.

835
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:07,199
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

836
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
- Dispatch, it's critical
now, we need backup now, over.

837
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,125
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

838
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,309
- Dispatch, we're trapped
inside this building.

839
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,843
Where is our freaking backup?

840
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,949
- [Sergeant] Harrison,
Jimenes, are you guys there?

841
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,783
- Sarge? Hey!

842
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:27,616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,616
Hey, Sarge,

844
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,009
Sarge, we are at the
old homeless shelter

845
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,349
on Fifth and Carter.

846
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,789
We need backup right away.

847
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,989
Where are you guys at?

848
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,219
- [Jimenes] I think we're
in the northeast side

849
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,053
of the building.

850
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:41,843
- We're in the northeast
side of the building.

851
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:43,559
- [Sergeant] Backup
is five minutes out.

852
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,849
- Backup is five minutes out?

853
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,499
Hey, Sarge, we ain't
got five minutes.

854
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,883
We need backup now.

855
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,069
There's some weird
shit going on here.

856
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,269
We need you now.

857
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,289
- [Sergeant] We're on our way.

858
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,290
Just hold on.

859
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,749
- [Harrison] Hold on to what?

860
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,369
- So we're supposed
to sit here and wait?

861
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,629
Oh, no, no, no,
no, I don't know.

862
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,630
No.

863
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,410
Think.

864
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,879
- Man, this makes
no fucking sense.

865
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,559
How do we not have
signal in here?

866
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
We're in the middle of the city

867
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:13,020
and we have no fucking signal.

868
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,749
- [Harrison] Yeah,
something's cutting off

869
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,100
our fucking signal in here.

870
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:21,949
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait wait.

871
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,860
Don't think it's kind of weird

872
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:25,863
that there's no fucking
windows in here, man?

873
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,099
There's no windows
on the outside,

874
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,199
there's nothing that
can connect anyone

875
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,640
from in here out there,

876
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,493
It's almost like - (sighs)

877
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:36,839
it's almost like they're trying
to keep something in here,

878
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,063
something to control
whatever's in here.

879
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:41,763
It's fucking weird, man.

880
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,269
We can't just sit here, man.

881
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,979
We can't just be sitting here.

882
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,923
There has to -

883
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:52,709
We have to do something.

884
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,119
God knows how far out they are.

885
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,283
Five minutes is long time.

886
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,369
- You know, let's
just keep moving.

887
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,757
Sarge will get back
to us sooner or later.

888
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:37,319
Your guess is as
good as mine, man.

889
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,079
I mean, this whole
place looks like it's -

890
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,339
We're in a fucking maze,

891
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,055
we're going in the same
circle over and over.

892
00:41:44,056 --> 00:41:47,056
(electronic static)

893
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:44,014
- [Jimenes] Man, this is fucked.

894
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,279
- [Harrison] This is
a fucked up place.

895
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,199
This is a shelter home?

896
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,650
- This is not a shelter, man.

897
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,460
There's supposed to be beds.

898
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:59,717
There's supposed to be
things to help the people.

899
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:30,329
- All right, Pete, would
you rather have sex

900
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,889
with a zombie or would
you rather have sex

901
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,699
with a 102-year-old woman
who's on her deathbed?

902
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,047
- We're doing this again?

903
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:42,663
- (chuckles) Until you pick one.

904
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:45,743
And you can't kill yourself.

905
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,656
Pick one.

906
00:43:50,657 --> 00:43:52,079
- [Jimenes] The the
woman man, the woman.

907
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
The old lady, fuck.

908
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,579
- Disgusting.
- You fucking asked.

909
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,580
- Gross.

910
00:43:58,438 --> 00:44:00,209
You have a thing for old ladies.

911
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,717
You usually do that
for money, right?

912
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,549
I think I might take the zombie,

913
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,889
because you know
it's already dead,

914
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,040
she's not gonna say no.

915
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:18,312
(distant growling)

916
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:20,935
- [Jimenes] Dude, is
there three of them?

917
00:44:20,936 --> 00:44:23,769
(distant banging)

918
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:51,655
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You hear something?

919
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:54,085
- [Jimenes] Dude, what is that?

920
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:55,083
- Is that coming from in here?

921
00:44:55,084 --> 00:44:56,333
Or is that ups-

922
00:44:58,184 --> 00:44:59,184
Hello?

923
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:10,896
Hello?

924
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:23,581
Jimenes! Jimenes!

925
00:45:23,582 --> 00:45:25,136
- [Jimenes] What?

926
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:26,115
- Hey.

927
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:27,293
Hey, how are you guys doing?

928
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,456
We're Metro PD, we're
here to help you, okay?

929
00:45:32,457 --> 00:45:33,633
Are you guys hurt?

930
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,380
Any pain?

931
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,809
Can you guys walk?
- [Jimenes] Hey.

932
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:43,643
Hey!

933
00:45:43,644 --> 00:45:45,972
- [Harrison] Hold on, give
me just one second, okay?

934
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:48,209
- What, dude, this is my spot.

935
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,187
- [Jimenes] Whoa, whoa.

936
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:52,889
- What the fuck is going on?

937
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,569
- [Harrison] Relax,
it's the police, okay.

938
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:55,683
- Oh God.

939
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,033
- [Jimenes] You okay? It-

940
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:01,616
Whoa, shit, what happened
to your arm, man?

941
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:05,129
- Well, I was coming
home last night,

942
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,959
if you could call this home.
- [Jimenes] God.

943
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,679
- And a dude jumped
out from behind a wall

944
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,000
and started like
rambling something at me

945
00:46:14,217 --> 00:46:15,717
and, I don't know.

946
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:19,975
He just fucking bit me.

947
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:20,809
- [Jimenes] Well,
we'll get someone

948
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:21,642
to take a look at that for you.

949
00:46:21,643 --> 00:46:23,339
Do you guys know of an exit?

950
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,109
Another exit from here?

951
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,749
- Well, there should be
one up front, nearby.

952
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,719
- [Harrison] No, we tried
that one, it was locked.

953
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,320
Do you guys know of another one?

954
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,973
- There's one in the
back on the lower level.

955
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,149
- Okay.
- What do we have to lose?

956
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,319
Let's go.
- Let's do it.

957
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,399
- All right guys.
- Cool.

958
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,145
- You guys ready, you guys good?

959
00:46:43,146 --> 00:46:43,979
You wanna get outta here?

960
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,915
We have EMS and paramedics
waiting for us on the outside

961
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,551
to look at you guys, so.

962
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:49,552
Okay?

963
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:51,759
- [Jimenes] Come with us, buddy.

964
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:52,592
We'll get some
help for you, okay?

965
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:53,789
- I'm not going to jail, am I?

966
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:54,623
- [Jimenes] No, no, no, no, no.

967
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:55,679
We're just gonna get
you guys outta here.

968
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,507
Doesn't look safe in here.

969
00:46:57,508 --> 00:46:59,339
(person moaning)
You good? You okay?

970
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,340
- Yes.

971
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,979
Gonna have some
breakfast, might as well.

972
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,773
Pulled it out of
the dumpster myself.

973
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,580
- [Harrison] Stay close,
you guys, stay close.

974
00:47:14,823 --> 00:47:16,473
- [Harrison] Stay
nice and close.

975
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:34,139
Jimenes, bringing up the rear?

976
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,130
- Yeah.
- You good?

977
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,130
- [Jimenes] Yeah.

978
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,997
- [Harrison] Hey, check
it out, check it out.

979
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,699
Some cameras probably has
to be a control around here,

980
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,499
we could contact
someone from here.

981
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,853
- No, not a chance.

982
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,059
They're monitored off-site.

983
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,050
- [Harrison] You sure?

984
00:47:58,051 --> 00:48:00,749
- Mm hmm, positive.

985
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,799
I volunteer here.

986
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,450
It's my job to
know those things.

987
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
- [Harrison] Shit.

988
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,179
Jimenes, we got a
tent in here, man.

989
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,183
I think this is where
the smell is coming from.

990
00:48:56,483 --> 00:48:57,768
(tent panels rustling)

991
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,436
(flies buzzing)

992
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:05,729
- We're good, keep
on moving, guys.

993
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:06,783
Just watch your step.

994
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:08,884
Okay.

995
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,919
- [Jimenes] So what kind of
homeless shelter is this?

996
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,149
I mean, this place is empty.

997
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,459
Do you usually have more people?

998
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,093
- Yeah, people come in
and out all the time.

999
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,854
- There's never an exact
amount of people here.

1000
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,129
- [Harrison] What?

1001
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,212
What do you mean, what kind
of homeless shelter is this?

1002
00:49:55,213 --> 00:49:58,274
(person coughs)

1003
00:49:58,275 --> 00:49:59,489
Oh, fuck, are you okay?

1004
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,490
Oh shit!

1005
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:05,339
(person groans)

1006
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,571
You okay?

1007
00:50:06,572 --> 00:50:08,133
- (groans) Yep.

1008
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,103
I need a second.

1009
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:11,390
- [Harrison] Come on, man, we
don't have time for this shit.

1010
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:12,625
We gotta keep moving, okay?

1011
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:15,293
(woman screams)

1012
00:50:17,143 --> 00:50:19,739
- [Jimenes] We've got
movement back here.

1013
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,692
- [Harrison] What the fuck?

1014
00:50:21,693 --> 00:50:23,819
- Have you guys
seen anything crazy

1015
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,429
or anything outta
the ordinary lately?

1016
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:31,203
- Just a few sick people and
just some fights and that's it.

1017
00:50:31,204 --> 00:50:33,179
- Why are you guys here?
- [Jimenes] Fights?

1018
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,759
- [Harrison] We got
called for an assault.

1019
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,809
You know, the
security guard said

1020
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,393
there might be an injury
here, or a possible body.

1021
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,019
We found one guy and
then he attacked us.

1022
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,219
We kept moving and
found another guy.

1023
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,799
He attacked us and he had
this fucking crazy rage

1024
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,113
in his eyes.
- Wait.

1025
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:50,821
We noticed there
were some people

1026
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:53,729
who get sick and they
just go to the hospital.

1027
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,339
- Yeah, we realize
everyone that left sick,

1028
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,423
they never came back.

1029
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,179
- [Harrison] Thank you guys.

1030
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,840
- We thought it was another
strain of COVID or something.

1031
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:07,674
- COVID?

1032
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:09,629
Oh, no, no, no.

1033
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,943
This is something different.

1034
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:14,483
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1035
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,251
Where'd he go?

1036
00:51:17,252 --> 00:51:19,619
- Fuck.
- [Harrison] Hey!

1037
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,719
- Jimenes, hey, we
gotta keep going.

1038
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,239
We gotta get these
people to safety.

1039
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,539
- [Jimenes] Dude, what
about the sick man, though?

1040
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,129
- We get outside,
we'll have more people

1041
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,299
to search this building, okay?

1042
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,739
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1043
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,571
- Come on, hey, stay with me.

1044
00:51:30,572 --> 00:51:31,431
Jimenes.

1045
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:33,209
- Okay.
- Pete!

1046
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,439
- [Jimenes] Gotcha man, yeah.
- Just keep moving, okay?

1047
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,582
We gotta get these
people outta here.

1048
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:38,640
Okay, which way is this exit?

1049
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,558

00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:47,586
Oh, shit.

1079
00:53:47,587 --> 00:53:50,098

1084
00:53:55,787 --> 00:53:57,809
- What the fuck was that?

1085

They're eating that man alive!

1086
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,130
We're safe here.

1087
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:07,109
They can't come in here.

1088
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,933
Wait, if we stay here,
will they come and find us?

1089
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:14,637
- [Harrison] I don't know.

1090
00:54:14,638 --> 00:54:16,199
I don't know.

1091
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,429
- What do you mean
you don't know?

1092
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,019
- It means we don't know, okay?

1093
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,993
The Sergeant told us to wait
here and hold for an update.

1094
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,729
- Look, hey, look, we
can't stay here, okay?

1095
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,649
We gotta fucking move, okay?

1096
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,740
You guys with me?

1097
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:38,906

00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:46,776
It's gonna be all right.

1100

00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,129
What are you doing?

1143
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,557
- Well you said this is the
manager facility office, right?

1144
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,759
So there has to be a blueprint,

1145
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,310

- I think so.

1163
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,633
- You think so?

1164
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,763
You didn't sound too
confident, can you get us here?

1165
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,473
- Yeah.

1166
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,799

or something for all
these guys out there.

1168
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:26,219
- Wait, I have an

- [Harrison] You have an idea?

1170
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,132
- We can use this, cellphone.

1171
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:30,153
- It's okay.

1172
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,273
Okay, let me take this map.

- [Jimenes] Oh, shit!

1225
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:31,734
- [Harrison] Hit him,
hit him, hit him, back!

1226
01:00:31,735 --> 01:00:32,568
Hit him, hit him!

1227
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:34,295
(loud thump)

1228
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:37,706
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit, oh,
shit. (breathes heavily.)

1229
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:39,836
- [Harrison] Fuck! Fuck!
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1230
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,308
- You okay?

1231
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:42,975
(eaters growling) Look,
look, what the fuck?

1232
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,405
- [Jimenes] Go, go, go.

1233
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:45,842
Oh, shit.

1234
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,342
Oh, shit! (woman screams)

1235
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,260
(eaters screaming)

1236
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:53,037
- [Harrison] You go,
guys, go go go go!

1237
01:00:53,038 --> 01:00:55,057
Move move move move!

1238
01:00:55,058 --> 01:00:56,405
(chaotic screaming)

1239
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:58,654
Come on, let's move.

1240
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,563
What the fuck?

1241
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:01,113
Come on, come on, come on!

1242
01:01:01,114 --> 01:01:01,947
(chaotic screaming continues)

1243
01:01:01,948 --> 01:01:03,165
Jimenes, Jimenes!

1244
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:04,715
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1245
01:01:04,716 --> 01:01:05,716
- Jimenes!

1246
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:09,202
(taser buzzes)

1247
01:01:09,203 --> 01:01:11,999
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- [Jimenes] Fuck, oh shit.

1248
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,631
Oh, shit!

1249
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:14,836
- [Speaker] Go, go, go!

1250
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,837
Go go go go!

1251
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,711
(eaters growling) Run!

1252
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:22,842
- [Harrison] Move, move, move,
Jimenes, come on, let's go!

1253
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:26,676
(chaotic screaming continues)

1254
01:01:53,956 --> 01:01:55,447
You good?

1255
01:01:55,448 --> 01:01:57,586
- Oh shit, oh shit.
- Look.

1256
01:01:57,587 --> 01:01:58,995
You guys okay?

1257
01:01:58,996 --> 01:02:03,996
(eaters screaming,
growling in the distance)

1258
01:02:11,491 --> 01:02:14,715
All right, they're fucking gone.

1259
01:02:14,716 --> 01:02:15,868
You see that shit?

1260
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:18,809
See all those fucking wounds,
fucking blood everywhere?

1261
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,669
Fucking bite marks,
what the fuck is that?

1262
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,279
- Dude, I can't believe
I'm saying this.

1263
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,605
Did you see all the wounds?

1264
01:02:24,606 --> 01:02:25,919
- [Harrison] You don't need
to say it, don't be stupid.

1265
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,405
- What if it's an infection?

1266
01:02:27,406 --> 01:02:29,463
They all were injured somehow.

1267
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,349
What if this is being spread
by bites or something?

1268
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,569
They all had wounds
on them, man.

1269
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:37,587
I don't know, I don't know.

1270
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:39,248
It's all I could
think of, is bites.

1271
01:02:39,249 --> 01:02:41,967
- Wait, am I bit? Am I bit?

1272
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,385
- [Jimenes] Shhh!

1273
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:45,387
- No, you're not, you're not.

1274
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:46,554
Calm her down!

1275
01:02:49,962 --> 01:02:51,847
(Velcro tearing)

1276
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:53,466
(paper rustling)

1277
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:54,800
We calm? We good? We relaxed?

1278
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:56,897
Okay, all right, where are we?

1279
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,817
Where are we?

1280
01:02:57,817 --> 01:02:58,817
Okay?

1281
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:03,991
Where are we?
- Jensen! Jensen! Jensen!

1282
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:06,107
(eater growls)

1283
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:08,284
(spine cracking)

1284
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,118
- [Harrison] What the f-

1285
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,125
(eater moaning)

1286
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:12,322
- [Jimenes] Watch your
back, watch your back!

1287
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:13,323
- Geez!

1288
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:21,136
(eater gurgling)

1289
01:03:21,137 --> 01:03:23,342
- [Jimenes] They can't see us.

1290
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:24,467
Jensen!
- [Harrison] What?

1291
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,085
- They can't see, we
can walk around it.

1292
01:03:26,086 --> 01:03:26,968
- What?
- We can walk around it,

1293
01:03:26,968 --> 01:03:27,926
it can't see us.
- You fucking out of your -

1294
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:32,343
(eater continues
gurgling, grunting)

1295
01:04:25,178 --> 01:04:26,553
- Right, where's the map?

1296
01:04:26,554 --> 01:04:27,617
Where's the map?

1297
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:29,048
Right, come on,
everyone, let's go.

1298
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:30,049
Go go go go.

1299
01:04:33,087 --> 01:04:35,754
(eater gurgles)

1300
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,312
- [Harrison] Right,
where the fuck are we?

1301
01:04:41,313 --> 01:04:43,233
Dude, we're all
fucking turned around.

1302
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:44,317
Where are we?

1303
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:47,723
Which way?

1304
01:04:47,724 --> 01:04:49,677
- Right here, we're right here.

1305
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:50,858
Almost there.

1306
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:52,219
- [Harrison] We're almost there.

1307
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,279
- [Jimenes] We gotta
move, we gotta move,

1308
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,113
we gotta move!

1309
01:04:54,113 --> 01:04:55,113
- All right.

1310
01:04:59,123 --> 01:05:01,623
(static ping)

1311
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,810
Come on, let's go.

1312
01:05:10,762 --> 01:05:13,370
Come on, over here, over here.

1313
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:16,178
All right.

1314
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:17,423
All right, let's look at this.

1315
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,416
What the fuck?

1316
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,417
What room?

1317
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,692
- I'm not sure.

1318
01:05:24,693 --> 01:05:26,775
- You're not sure, huh?

1319
01:05:26,776 --> 01:05:28,449
(eaters groaning)

1320
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:30,650
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1321
01:05:30,651 --> 01:05:31,573
- Megan?

1322
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:33,800
- Shhh, wait.
- No no no no, it's not.

1323
01:05:33,801 --> 01:05:35,009
- [Harrison] Stay
here, stay here.

1324
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:37,109
- We can't just leave
or we gotta go find her.

1325
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,110
- No!

1326
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,733
If you guys go, we have
to leave without you guys.

1327
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,973
- Fuck.
- [Harrison] Wait!

1328
01:05:42,974 --> 01:05:44,413
No, no, fuck fuck!

1329
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:46,012
(chaotic screaming)

1330
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:47,212
Jimenes!

1331
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:51,592
(chaotic screaming continues)

1332
01:05:51,593 --> 01:05:52,426
- Shit, fuck.

1333
01:05:52,427 --> 01:05:53,869
- [Harrison] No, no, Jimenes,

1334
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,921
We gotta get outta here first,
then we come back for them.

1335
01:05:55,922 --> 01:05:56,922
Come on!

1336
01:05:57,945 --> 01:06:00,195
- [Jimenes] Fuck!
- Jimenes!

1337
01:06:02,514 --> 01:06:04,303
Get the fuck outta here, man.

1338
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:05,352
- [Jimenes] Yeah, okay.

1339
01:06:05,353 --> 01:06:07,520
- Get the fuck outta here.

1340
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:10,439
Jimenes.
- Where the fuck are we going?

1341
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,107
- Let's go this way.

1342
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:16,697
(shrill screaming)

1343
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:17,531
What the fuck is that sound?

1344
01:06:17,532 --> 01:06:19,531
You hearing this?
- Yeah.

1345
01:06:21,385 --> 01:06:22,285
Fuck, I don't know.

1346
01:06:22,286 --> 01:06:23,558
- Fuck, all right, come on.

1347
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:24,976
Let's keep going.

1348
01:06:29,884 --> 01:06:30,784
I think we're right here.

1349
01:06:30,785 --> 01:06:31,913
Let's go around
this fucking corner.

1350
01:06:31,914 --> 01:06:36,914
- [Jimenes] Oh shit, oh
shit! (eaters growling)

1351
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:38,791
(static ping)

1352
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:41,223
- [Harrison] Jimenes,
pick up your feet!

1353
01:06:41,224 --> 01:06:42,872
- (breathing heavily) Oh, shit!

1354
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:43,706
Oh shit! Oh shit!
- Jimenes, follow me,

1355
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:45,496
follow me, follow me!

1356
01:06:45,497 --> 01:06:49,084
Jensen, Jensen, Jensen!
- [Harrison] Jimenes!

1357
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:49,918
Come on!

1358
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:51,973
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

1359
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:52,807
Oh shit!

1360
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,784
- Jimenes, Jimenes!
- Oh shit!

1361
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:59,033
(chaotic eater growling)

1362
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:00,441
- Where are we going?
- Jimenes, I'm here, I'm here!

1363
01:07:00,442 --> 01:07:02,109
Right, right, right!

1364
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:05,474
- [Jimenes] Shit, oh, oh shit.

1365
01:07:05,475 --> 01:07:06,308
- [Harrison] Where's that map?

1366
01:07:06,308 --> 01:07:07,225
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

1367
01:07:07,226 --> 01:07:10,006
- [Harrison] All right, look
at the map, look at the map!

1368
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:11,453
Right, right, right!

1369
01:07:11,454 --> 01:07:14,751
(chaotic screaming, growling)

1370
01:07:14,752 --> 01:07:18,835
- [Jimenes] Where'd you go?
- [Harrison] Jimenes!

1371
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,102
Jimenes, over here!

1372
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:25,186
- [Jimenes] Wait,
wait, where are we?

1373
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:28,746
- [Harrison] I don't fucking
know where we are now.

1374
01:07:28,747 --> 01:07:31,914
(indistinct shouting)

1375
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:36,997
- [Jimenes] Jensen!

1376
01:07:39,939 --> 01:07:42,856
(muffled growling)

1377
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:49,754
- Jimenes, go, go, come on!

1378
01:07:49,755 --> 01:07:51,613
Don't stop, don't stop!

1379
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:52,904
- [Jimenes] Right there!
- [Harrison] Fuck!

1380
01:07:52,905 --> 01:07:54,522
(door banging) Ah, shit.

1381
01:07:54,523 --> 01:07:55,982
This has to be it,
this has to be it!

1382
01:07:55,983 --> 01:07:59,213
(door slams) Fuck!

1383
01:07:59,214 --> 01:08:02,631
(both breathing heavily)

1384
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:08,653
- [Jimenes] Where
the fuck are we?

1385
01:08:08,654 --> 01:08:10,154
- [Harrison] Fuck.

1386
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:12,066
I don't know.

1387
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,505
(Velcro tearing)
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1388
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,339
(Paper rustling)

1389
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,899
This is supposed
to be an exit, man.

1390
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,459
- Yeah, well this is
where the fucking -

1391
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,895
This is where the
fucking map points.

1392
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:20,973
- [Jimenes] Where
the fuck is the exit?

1393
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:22,564
- [Harrison] God damn
it, dropped my torch.

1394
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:26,118
(indistinct frustrated talking)

1395
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:27,182
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1396
01:08:27,183 --> 01:08:31,616
- [Harrison] Fuck are
we? (siren wails briefly)

1397
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:34,617
(metallic rumbling)

1398
01:08:39,552 --> 01:08:42,048
God damn, we're in
a fucking elevator.

1399
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:43,466
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1400
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:51,301
(metallic rumbling continues)

1401
01:09:11,964 --> 01:09:14,714
(doors rumbling)

1402
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:18,848
(heavy breathing)

1403
01:09:21,014 --> 01:09:22,347
- What the fuck?

1404
01:09:24,218 --> 01:09:25,973
(doors creaking)

1405
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:28,433
- [Jimenes] What the
hell is this place?

1406
01:09:28,434 --> 01:09:30,934
- I don't know, what the fuck?

1407
01:09:34,225 --> 01:09:35,225
Look.

1408
01:09:39,804 --> 01:09:41,076
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

1409
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,229
- [Harrison] This is
some kinda facility

1410
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,633
for the fucking CDC?

1411
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,573
- But why would it be
under a homeless shelter?

1412
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,180
- [Harrison] How the
fuck should I know?

1413
01:09:57,666 --> 01:10:00,416
(paper rustling)

1414
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,439
- [Jimenes] They're doing
some sort of experiments

1415
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,440
down here.

1416
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:11,958
- Oh my god.

1417
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,010
They're using this place as
some kind of testing facility.

1418
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,839
All these fucking
poor bastards are

1419
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,129
just fucking experiments.

1420
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,393
God damn guinea pigs.

1421
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,600
- What? Fuck. (paper rustling)

1422
01:10:35,099 --> 01:10:39,690
What the fuck is this?

1423
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:41,603
- [Harrison] I don't
think it's good, man.

1424
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,423
I don't think -

1425
01:10:44,424 --> 01:10:46,623
- [Jimenes] We gotta
get outta here like now.

1426
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:57,710
(metallic ping)

1427
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,461
(water dripping)

1428
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,872
(Radio beeps)
- [Sergeant] Harrison,

1429
01:11:04,873 --> 01:11:05,999
are you guys there?
- About God damn time,

1430
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,409
fuck, fuck.

1431
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:09,180
Yeah, sarge, yeah, we're here.

1432
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,029
- [Sergeant] Look,
we're all here now.

1433
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,189
We're working
close with the CDC.

1434
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,899
There's some sort
of case of scabies,

1435
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,089
a skin parasite, like rabies.

1436
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,129
They're working on
getting quart set up

1437
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,259
before they can get you out.

1438
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,899
The health department is
preparing to enter the building.

1439
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,036
Where are you guys, exactly?

1440
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:27,059
- No, no no, no.

1441
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,260
- [Jimenes] Dude.
- No.

1442
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,129
- We've been exposed.

1443
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,479
If they find out that we
know what they've been doing

1444
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,547
down here, they're not
gonna let us out, man.

1445
01:11:34,548 --> 01:11:36,639
We're a fucking liability.

1446
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,160
- Think, God damn it, think.

1447
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,699
Sarge.

1448
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,229
Yeah, Sarge, hey, we
know of another exit.

1449
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,873
We're gonna head
there right now.

1450
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,899
(radio beeps)
- [Sergeant] No, stay put.

1451
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,852
They want to -

1452
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:00,046
(loud screaming over radio)

1453
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:01,047
- Oh, shit.

1454
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,439
- Sarge?

1455
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,459
Sarge, come in, over?

1456
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,659
Dispatch? Try yours.

1457
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,369
Dispatch?
- [Jimenes] Sarge?

1458
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,238
Dispatch, are you guys there?

1459
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,853
- [Harrison] What the fuck?

1460
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,443
- Let's just keep moving.

1461
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,840
Let's keep pushing forward.

1462
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:29,913
- Jesus Christ.

1463
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:35,463
- I guess the CDC doesn't
believe in the housekeeping, huh?

1464
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:42,540
- [Jimenes] Dude, what
the fuck is this place?

1465
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:44,458
- Fuck, I have no idea.

1466
01:12:56,547 --> 01:12:57,896
(strained groaning)

1467
01:12:57,897 --> 01:12:59,469
Oh shit!
- Oh shit!

1468
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,970
What, where the fuck do we go?

1469
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:13,386
(strained groaning continues)

1470
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,434
(radio static)

1471
01:13:39,435 --> 01:13:42,435
(agitated grunting)

1472
01:13:50,582 --> 01:13:52,062
(Jimenes grunting)
(spine cracking)

1473
01:13:52,063 --> 01:13:54,896
(heavy breathing)

1474
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:05,091
(multiple groans, grunts)

1475
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:06,925
- [Harrison] Shh, shh.

1476
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,270
(strained groaning)

1477
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:45,002
(strained groaning continues)

1478
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:23,746
(light bulb clinking)

1479
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:30,905
- Fuck.

1480
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:35,268
- [Harrison] What do
you think was in there?

1481
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:58,178
(door creaking)
(screen rattling)

1482
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:08,216
We need to find our way
back to the surface.

1483
01:16:08,217 --> 01:16:09,961
(metal banging)
(indistinct talking)

1484
01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:10,853
Motherfucker!

1485
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:12,604
- Stop, wait!

1486
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:14,899
I'm not affected, I'm
not one of those things.

1487
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,733
- No?

1488
01:16:15,733 --> 01:16:16,566
Yeah, but I bet you're
the motherfucker

1489
01:16:16,566 --> 01:16:17,399
who started this shit,

1490
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,059
I just ran into your
friends upstairs.

1491
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,339
- I was just doing my job!

1492
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,173
- Your job?

1493
01:16:21,174 --> 01:16:22,310
What's that, playing God?

1494
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,529
You better start
fucking talking.

1495
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,179
- You know I can't
fucking say anything.

1496
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,439
- Bullshit!

1497
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,370
Fucking bullshit!

1498
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:30,989
You think it's
good cop, bad cop?

1499
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,949
You better start talking

1500
01:16:31,949 --> 01:16:32,820
or I'll fucking
kill you right here.

1501
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:33,899
Do understand me?

1502
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,399
- We were just trying to help.

1503
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,049
We're finding
cures for diseases.

1504
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,290
- Fuck you.

1505
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:39,391
You're a fucking liar.

1506
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,119
- First, first,
it was just small.

1507
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,233
Small hosts.

1508
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,760
- Do you believe this shit?

1509
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:49,594
What?

1510
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:51,033
- Rabbits, rats.

1511
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,050
- But?

1512
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:57,059
- The higher ups
wanted us to experiment

1513
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:00,359
with larger animals,
larger hosts,

1514
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,373
cats, dogs.

1515
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:04,330
- Humans?

1516
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:08,639
- Answer him.

1517
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,063
Answer the question!
- They were terminally ill.

1518
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,289
- Bullshit.
- They were dying.

1519
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,590
It wasn't gonna go
further than that.

1520
01:17:14,591 --> 01:17:15,450
- Bullshit!

1521
01:17:15,451 --> 01:17:18,200
You knew exactly what you
were fucking doing down here.

1522
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,889
- [Jimenes] What happened
to everyone down here?

1523
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:23,790
- What happened?

1524
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:25,053
- Specimen got loose.

1525
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:26,970
Affected the lead researcher.

1526
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:28,189
- And he didn't report it?

1527
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,360
- It affected
everyone down here.

1528
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:33,479
- [Jimenes] Not only down here.

1529
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,980
- It reached the surface, too?

1530
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,329
We gotta get outta here.

1531
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,170
- Yeah, no shit!

1532
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:42,659
And you're gonna
fucking show us how.

1533
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,549
- They'll never let us out of
here, we're all fucking dead!

1534
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,903
- Man, you might be.

1535
01:17:51,826 --> 01:17:54,826
(metallic rumbling)

1536
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:00,899
- If the virus got out,
we're all fucking dead.

1537
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,900
- Just keep walking.

1538
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,400
- They're never
gonna let us leave.

1539
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,919
- [Jimenes] No loose
ends, no liabilities.

1540
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,329
- No.

1541
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:13,880
We're getting outta here, okay?

1542
01:18:21,598 --> 01:18:22,903
Stop.

1543
01:18:22,904 --> 01:18:24,321
Wait right there.

1544
01:18:33,766 --> 01:18:36,683
(objects clanging)

1545
01:18:54,302 --> 01:18:56,969
(metal sliding)

1546
01:18:58,492 --> 01:19:01,184
(clanging continues)

1547
01:19:01,185 --> 01:19:02,152
- What is it?

1548
01:19:02,152 --> 01:19:03,152
- An exit.

1549
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,547
It's right around that door.

1550
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:07,548
- And?

1551
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:21,116
(eater growling)

1552
01:19:25,837 --> 01:19:27,837
- What the fuck is that?

1553
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,383
What the fuck are you
guys working on here?

1554
01:19:34,294 --> 01:19:37,044
(eater grunting)

1555
01:19:39,043 --> 01:19:41,960
- Fucking lead us
out, lead us out!

1556
01:19:46,876 --> 01:19:47,980
Right, stay close.

1557
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:49,981
Quiet, stay close, okay?

1558
01:19:57,544 --> 01:20:01,675
(Researching screaming)

1559
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:02,717
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

1560
01:20:02,718 --> 01:20:04,468
- Run, run!
- Oh shit.

1561
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:06,759
- [Harrison]
Jimenes, pick it up!

1562
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,680
Move your feet, man, come on!

1563
01:20:08,681 --> 01:20:12,348
- Oh fuck, oh shit!
- Pick it up, pick it up!

1564
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:15,659
Fuck you, fuck you!

1565
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,989
- [Jimenes] What
the fuck was that?

1566
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:19,199
- We gotta fucking go.

1567
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,291
We gotta fucking go, come on.

1568
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:23,803
Come on, Jimenes!
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1569
01:20:23,804 --> 01:20:26,471
(metallic ping)

1570
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:29,905
What the fuck was that?

1571
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,333
We need to get the

Fuck are we now?

1575
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,199
(Velcro tearing)

1576
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,309
(paper rustling)
- Is this map even worth

1577
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,310
anything anymore?

1578
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:58,630
Is it that way?

1579
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,499

(paper rustling)

1587
01:21:21,345 --> 01:21:22,428
- Okay, okay.

All right.

1589
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,753
So.

01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:28,599
05 13 89, that's
where the exit's at.

1591
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,809
So we just gotta keep
following this, right?

01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:32,463
So, all right.

All right, 05 13,

01:21:40,627 --> 01:21:43,139
We're gonna go left up

1598
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,279
on the right, that
corridor there.

1599
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,669
Exit should be there, okay?

1600
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,807
- [Jimenes] Okay, let's
go, let's go, let's just -

1601
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:58,177
