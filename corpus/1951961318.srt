1
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,637
<i>(Man) Listen up, guys.</i>
<i>This is our last opportunity.</i>

2
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,673
<i>If we don't find something this time,</i>
<i>we've gotta wrap it all up.</i>

3
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,189
<i>Mario, it should curve off</i>
<i>to your left just ahead.</i>

4
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,989
<i>(Mario) Sì, Professore. Sì.</i>

5
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,319
(Foghorn)

6
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,636
<i>(Man) Now it should be straight ahead.</i>

7
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,917
<i>Good. Very good.</i>

8
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,030
Buongiorno, Don Vito.

9
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,150
What do we have?

10
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,031
It's the last dive, signore.
Hopefully we will find something.

11
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,599
And I pay hundreds of thousands of euro

12
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,518
for clues on updated maps
of Marco Polo.

13
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,875
Perhaps his methods aren't so updated.

14
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,036
He's old! And useless.

15
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,199
(Sighs)

16
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,516
- (Rumbling)
- <i>What's that?</i>

17
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,993
<i>Nothing.</i>

18
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,031
<i>Nothing. Let's go.</i>

19
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,630
<i>According to the map, there should be</i>
<i>a passageway right here.</i>

20
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,230
<i>There it is! Follow me.</i>

21
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,072
(Sighs)

22
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,475
<i>Yes. Artefacts.</i>
<i>We're getting very close now.</i>

23
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,515
<i>Wait. There's something ahead here.</i>

24
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,911
<i>It's a plaque of some sort.</i>

25
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,069
<i>It dates to the correct time period.</i>

26
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,595
<i>The inscription is in Latin.</i>

27
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,949
Dio mio!

28
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,956
<i>"Ingredi mortuus."</i>

29
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,911
<i>Here walk the dead.</i>

30
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,997
<i>The Medicis.</i>
<i>Confirming coordinates.</i>

31
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,319
Grazie, Marco Polo!

32
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,038
<i>(Screams)</i>

33
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,833
Professore, get out!
Paolo, Mario, shark in the water!

34
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,998
- Shut up!
- <i>What? Say again. You're breaking up.</i>

35
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,439
What are you talking about?

36
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,953
<i>The chamber should be</i>
<i>roughly 100 metres ahead.</i>

37
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,712
<i>(Screaming)</i>

38
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,554
(Shrieks)

39
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,150
<i>The water is very murky here.</i>

40
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,191
<i>The visibility is limited.</i>

41
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,673
<i>(Yells)</i>

42
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,437
<i>(Distorted signal)</i>

43
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,711
(Voice trembling)
Professore, what's happening?

44
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,518
<i>(Rapid beeping)</i>

45
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,037
He's dead.

46
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,277
He's dead.

47
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,311
These images you're seeing now

48
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,399
were taken on an expedition
that I was on about four years ago.

49
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,352
This is the Andrea Doria.

50
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,958
She is another..."unsinkable" ship
that went down in 1956.

51
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,318
Sits at a depth of about 250 feet
in a place that, trust me,

52
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,271
most of you would not wanna be.

53
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,435
250 feet? Please.

54
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,517
Would you care to elaborate on that
rather astute comment, Mr Jensen?

55
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,189
I can dive 400 feet with my eyes closed,
no problem.

56
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,629
I'll bet you could jump
the very same distance

57
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,070
- with your eyes closed right off a cliff, too.
- (Laughter)

58
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,272
You see, kids, it's not only
the attitude or ego

59
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,515
that Mr Jensen is displaying right now

60
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,314
that causes most of the accidents
on expeditions just like this one.

61
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,876
It's not only about the depth or,
in Mr Jensen's case, size.

62
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,909
(Laughter)

63
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,520
Ocean weather around the Doria

64
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,154
that can go from one minute
completely calm and clear,

65
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,832
to the next minute, ripping currents that
can toss this 30,000-tonne ship like a toy.

66
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,759
And if that were not enough,
inside the ship's very dark corridors

67
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,554
can become like a maze or,
for some divers in the past, a tomb.

68
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,034
Many have lost their lives
inside this ship.

69
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,833
And if that weren't enough,
then of course there's...

70
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,636
the sharks.

71
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,148
No problem. Right, Mr Jensen?

72
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,678
(Knock on door)

73
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,354
You guys review chapter four.
I'll be back in one minute.

74
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,475
David, there's been an accident in Venice.

75
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,511
- Is my dad all right?
- He was on a dive.

76
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,676
Two of his colleagues are dead
and he's missing.

77
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,678
- What happened?
- Looks like a propeller accident.

78
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,636
- I knew I shouldn't have let him go.
- He could never take no for an answer.

79
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,590
- I'd better get over there.
- All right, David.

80
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,438
We'll take care of all your expenses.
Just keep us posted.

81
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,429
Oh, baby... I just heard.

82
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,799
I'm so sorry.

83
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,798
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I guess so.

84
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,114
- What do you wanna do?
- I've gotta go.

85
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,312
- I'm coming, too.
- Sure you can get out of your classes?

86
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,636
I'm not letting you go through this alone.
Come on, let's go.

87
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,277
It's beautiful here.

88
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,038
Yeah, I know.

89
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,798
And look where we gotta go.

90
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,713
(Speaking Italian)

91
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,751
Capisce. Capisce.

92
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,595
Dr Franks? Lieutenant Sofia Totti
of the Venice Police.

93
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,153
My fiancée, Laura.

94
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,634
We're very sorry for what happened
to your father, sir.

95
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,079
What happened?

96
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,634
Well, it appears that your father
and two of his colleagues

97
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,955
were diving in a restricted area.

98
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,912
And, er... a boat hit them
as they were surfacing.

99
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,836
Now, is either of these two men
your father?

100
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,394
(Sighs)

101
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,589
No.

102
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,198
What did you say was the cause of death?

103
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,836
I didn't. But we were informed it was
a boat propeller from one of the buses.

104
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,155
But you don't believe that?

105
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,396
- Well, that was the report.
- Oh, this was no propeller.

106
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,034
- What do you mean?
- Well, if what happened to these two men

107
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,356
happened in water, then, Lieutenant Totti...

108
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,753
this was a shark.

109
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,428
I've done enough work in water
and seen enough attacks

110
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,278
to know that these lacerations
were not caused by any boat.

111
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,039
When we perform the autopsy
we will know for sure.

112
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,438
Well, thank you, Dr Franks.

113
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,790
My boss would like to see you, so if
you could just come down to the station

114
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,274
to fill out some paperwork,
that would be great.

115
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,117
Thank you.

116
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,071
(Talking, phones ringing)

117
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,591
- (Knock on door)
- (Man) Prego.

118
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,073
Ah. Benvenuti.

119
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,076
- I'm Captain Bonasera.
- Nice to meet you.

120
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,634
Welcome. Please, sit.

121
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,155
- I would like to convey my condolences.
- What for, Captain?

122
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,432
Mr Franks, your father
was diving in a restricted area.

123
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,755
With no permits and no insurance.

124
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,273
What he was doing was... illegal.

125
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,997
I just wanna go look for him.

126
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,474
We have already searched
the entire area.

127
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,670
It would mean a lot to my family.

128
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,718
I am afraid...

129
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,069
that would require special permission,
which...

130
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,352
Maybe the American embassy
can get involved to help expedite that.

131
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,917
Very well. On three conditions.

132
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,952
One, you have 48 hours.

133
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,356
Two, you will sign
a confidentiality agreement,

134
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,472
which includes no speaking to the press.

135
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,671
And three, Lieutenant Totti here

136
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,233
will accompany you...

137
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,998
at all times.

138
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,474
Agreed. Thank you, Captain.

139
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,316
One more thing, Mr Franks.

140
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,954
I hear you are talking about... sharks.

141
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,997
We do not have sharks in Venice.
Capisce?

142
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,917
Why is everyone so against the idea
of a shark attack?

143
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,474
Well, you must understand
the implications, Dr Franks.

144
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,876
Our streets are not like any other
in this world. They are canals.

145
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,309
To suggest that there is killer sharks
swimming in them

146
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,351
could have serious repercussions.

147
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,551
I'm gonna go on a dive,
so I'm gonna need a boat and another diver.

148
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,194
Well, it'll take a couple of hours
to organise that.

149
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,356
We can go to my dad's place
in the meantime.

150
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,234
(Bell chiming)

151
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,030
Oh, my God.
It looks like somebody's been here.

152
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,279
(David) Why am I not surprised?

153
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,311
What was your father
doing in Venice, anyway?

154
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,671
Working for the university.

155
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,233
On what?

156
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,748
An underwater excavation.
I don't have all the details.

157
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,429
- Are you sure it was legal?
- That's not important right now.

158
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,677
What is is who did this
and why you don't know about it.

159
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,553
- Who says we don't?
- Well, you never said anything.

160
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,159
Laura.

161
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,631
Give me a second.

162
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,269
What do you think
they were looking for, David?

163
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,839
I'm not sure. But knowing my dad,
whatever it was...

164
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,351
I'll bet it's still here.

165
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,630
What do you mean?

166
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,875
Dad has always been rather...

167
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,512
meticulous.

168
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,353
Oh, Dad.

169
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,355
Some things never change.

170
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,997
I knew it.

171
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,190
Help me with this table, would you?

172
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,035
What's all this?

173
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,071
Herein lieth...

174
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,957
the rub.

175
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,950
It's my father's notes.

176
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,272
"The eighth crusade,
sponsored by Louis XIV,

177
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,153
- "led by the Medici brothers..."
- <i>(Father)... the Medici brothers,</i>

178
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,272
<i>three Venetian knights who assembled</i>
<i>an army of crusaders</i>

179
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,117
<i>that marched across Europe,</i>

180
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,833
<i>cutting a swath of destruction</i>
<i>and death.</i>

181
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,153
<i>They pillaged and plundered</i>
<i>everything in their path</i>

182
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,715
<i>on their way to the old Byzantine</i>
<i>port city of Antonia.</i>

183
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,232
<i>There, for 20 days and 20 nights,</i>

184
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,396
<i>they laid siege to the city.</i>

185
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,871
<i>The fighting was furious</i>

186
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,878
<i>but the Antonians were no match</i>
<i>for the ruthless invaders.</i>

187
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,156
<i>When the battlements were breached,</i>
<i>the city fell.</i>

188
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,957
<i>The streets ran red with blood</i>
<i>on their merciless quest.</i>

189
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,077
(Shrieking)

190
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,793
<i>They tortured anyone and everyone.</i>

191
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,188
<i>And if they did not get</i>
<i>the information they wanted...</i>

192
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,118
<i>Legend has it that</i>
<i>the Medicis knew of the existence</i>

193
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,515
<i>of King Solomon's treasures in Antonia,</i>

194
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,953
<i>which had been transported</i>
<i>centuries earlier on a galleon called Stella.</i>

195
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,357
<i>The Medicis' cruelty</i>
<i>and inhumanity paid off.</i>

196
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,719
<i>They found the entrance</i>
<i>to the long-lost tomb.</i>

197
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,796
<i>And inside</i>
<i>found what so many had thirsted for.</i>

198
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,429
<i>They plundered the King's chamber,</i>

199
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,755
<i>and with the help of Marco Polo's fleet,</i>

200
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,678
<i>brought the treasures by boat</i>
<i>back to Venice.</i>

201
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,950
<i>There were those who wanted</i>
<i>what the Medicis had.</i>

202
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,912
<i>The brothers hid the treasure</i>
<i>underneath the floating city</i>

203
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,520
<i>and murdered all those</i>
<i>who helped them bury it.</i>

204
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,920
<i>Shortly after,</i>
<i>they were murdered themselves</i>

205
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,155
<i>and the treasure was lost again.</i>

206
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,918
Sounds like some kind of wishful fantasy.

207
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,594
Pieces of the Medici treasure
have been recovered, but very few.

208
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,108
- How would you know?
- She's an expert.

209
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,434
In the medieval time period.
She's... really smart.

210
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,837
Let me see.

211
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,994
This looks like some kind of coordinates.

212
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,149
Probably something
Dad was searching for.

213
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,712
(Bell chiming)

214
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,916
Continue on to your left.

215
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,992
OK. We go.

216
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,558
I think we're getting close.
Is this where the accident happened?

217
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,070
Well, we don't know exactly, cos the
bodies were recovered six hours later.

218
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,634
- They floated with the current.
- Oh, that makes it easy.

219
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,238
What do you mean?

220
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,229
Divers getting killed by
an unknown propeller, an unknown boat.

221
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,078
Chalk it up to an accident.
No questions, no answers needed.

222
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,156
You should be careful what you're implying.

223
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,715
Well, maybe you should be a little
less sloppy with your investigation.

224
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,751
- It was an accident.
- Oh.

225
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,553
And the ransacking of the apartment -
was that an accident, too?

226
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,434
Laura... let's concentrate on
us getting in the water.

227
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,236
Just be careful. I don't want another
accident to happen to you, too.

228
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,271
I'm gonna be very quick. Don't worry.

229
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,753
- Anything on sonar?
- It's a little murky.

230
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,271
Well, yes, unfortunately, our canals
are also known for their pollution.

231
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,311
That's why accidents happen.

232
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,079
Well, we'll have a pin-camera
and a transmitter with us.

233
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,111
You can track us with the sonar.

234
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,629
OK, signore, we stop now.

235
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,631
- All right. Transmitter on.
- (Bleeping)

236
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,671
- Receiving.
- Let's go.

237
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,114
- <i>It's really narrow, Dr Franks.</i>
- <i>No, it's OK. It opens up just ahead.</i>

238
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,714
- <i>How's the read, baby?</i>
- Visual's good. Sonar's clean.

239
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,675
<i>I'm at the entrance of</i>
<i>some kind of tunnel.</i>

240
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,638
<i>Let's go.</i>

241
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,671
<i>I think it's this way.</i>

242
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,518
<i>Huh? No. This way.</i>

243
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,391
<i>How's the signal, Laura?</i>

244
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,839
<i>(Occasional bleeping)</i>

245
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,557
Getting weaker.
I wouldn't go too much further.

246
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,957
<i>My dad's watch.</i>

247
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,114
<i>Dr Franks, where are you? I've lost you.</i>

248
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,833
David, Pietro, d'you copy?

249
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,839
- Shit.
- Here. I'll keep trying the radio.

250
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,871
You work the sonar.

251
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,911
Franks. Dr Franks, do you copy?

252
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,631
<i>I see something right in front of me.</i>

253
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,309
<i>It's in Latin. "Hic ingredi mortuus."</i>

254
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,920
Here walk... the dead.

255
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,957
The Medicis.

256
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,079
(Yells)

257
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,712
(Screams)

258
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,559
(Bleeping)

259
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,029
Do you read? Franks? Franks?

260
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,355
Pietro? Do you read?

261
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,433
Shoot.

262
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,277
It's only false positives.

263
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,079
<i>Pietro?</i>

264
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,231
<i>Pietro, where are you?</i>

265
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,711
- Pietro.
- <i>(Buzzing)</i>

266
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,468
David, come in.

267
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,033
<i>Oh, no.</i>

268
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,798
<i>A shark killed Pietro.</i>

269
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,431
Pietro's dead.

270
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,118
- <i>Grande tiburón blanco.</i>
- Great white.

271
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,950
Mayday. We need assistance.

272
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,195
We need an ambulance.
Canale stazione.

273
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,639
(Siren)

274
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,910
<i>Canale stazione. Pronto.</i>

275
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,837
(Siren)

276
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,670
<i>The tank's very low.</i>

277
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,829
David, please get out of there.

278
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,434
<i>Laura, do you have a fix</i>
<i>on my position?</i>

279
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,036
<i>Find me a way outta here.</i>

280
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,551
I think there's a chamber off to your right.

281
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,639
<i>(Yells)</i>

282
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,195
David, please get out of there.

283
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,116
It's impossible.
This is... this is not happening.

284
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,271
<i>(Laura) David, can you answer me?</i>

285
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,794
- <i>Are you all right?</i>
- I was bit.

286
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,831
But I can move.

287
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,955
- (Radio crackling)
- <i>David. Are you there?</i>

288
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,791
I can barely hear you.

289
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,277
<i>Where are you?</i>

290
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,715
I don't know.
Some kind of underground tunnel.

291
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,396
<i>Is there a way out?</i>

292
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,476
I'm gonna have to swim for it.

293
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,074
You don't know where you are
and I can't track you in there.

294
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,111
(Breathless) Laura, listen to me.

295
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,151
I'm bleeding and I can't talk.

296
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,672
I have to go. I love you.

297
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,158
Easy.

298
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,191
Take it easy, baby.

299
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,276
It's OK, you're safe now.

300
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,713
- How long have I been out?
- Two days.

301
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,991
You lost a lot of blood.

302
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,116
You blacked out under there.

303
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,838
A gondola driver found you
and pulled you out.

304
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,911
I thought I'd lost you.

305
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,790
- Pietro?
- I'm so sorry, baby. He didn't make it.

306
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,997
I have something to tell you.

307
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,950
I found the Medici treasure.

308
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,480
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

309
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,630
Where's my...

310
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,877
- Where's my dive suit?
- What are you talking about, baby?

311
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,637
(Tap on door)

312
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,751
I hope you're feeling better.

313
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,518
Still don't think there's any sharks
in Venice, Captain?

314
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,516
Mr Franks...

315
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,836
may I remind you that you have
signed a confidentiality agreement?

316
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,440
People are dead and you still don't care.

317
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,834
Don't worry. We're leaving.

318
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,075
Just as long as
we understand each other.

319
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,391
Signorina.

320
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,630
- What are you going to do now?
- We're going home.

321
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,676
- Laura...
- David, you're not going diving again.

322
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,393
Your father was attacked by a shark,
just like you were.

323
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,318
Except the only difference is
you're still alive.

324
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,320
Dr Franks, I am Rossi. My employer
wishes you to join him for some dinner.

325
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,111
Who's your employer?

326
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,110
Someone you don't want to turn down.

327
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,951
Does this have
anything to do with my father?

328
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,479
Yes.

329
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,630
Don't worry, we are friendly people
here in Venezia.

330
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,831
Lo Rialto restaurant at seven.

331
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,159
Grazie. Please, sit down.

332
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,315
- Vito Clemenza.
- Hello.

333
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,911
Thank you for joining me for dinner.

334
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,318
So... how are you connected
to my father?

335
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,837
I helped finance... his expedition.

336
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,434
Oh. I thought it was sponsored
by the university.

337
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,835
And who do you think
sponsored the university?

338
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,878
What is it you're looking for?

339
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,399
Treasure. The same one you found.

340
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,031
Where did you get that?

341
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,637
That is not important.

342
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,869
What is, is that il tesoro
is worth over $200 million.

343
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,034
I need you to take us back
to where you found it.

344
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,071
I'm not so sure I can do that.

345
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,395
- Why not?
- It's complicated.

346
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,432
Down there there's many tunnels.
It can be very disorienting.

347
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,910
Doctor, you are the only one
who has seen il tesoro

348
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,520
in more than five centuries.

349
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,634
Mr Clemenza, even if he could find
his way back there I wouldn't permit it.

350
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,035
There are killer sharks down there.

351
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,552
Ten per cent. $20 million.

352
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,397
It's OK?

353
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,314
Look at this as a wedding gift.

354
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,470
Doctor, I'm serious.

355
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,876
This is an advance of $2 million.

356
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,077
A gesture of good faith.

357
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,393
Go ahead. Take it.

358
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,078
That's a generous offer.

359
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,993
We're not interested.

360
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,153
You should show us a little respect,
signorina.

361
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,672
Doctor.

362
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,870
It's obvious you are an intelligent man.

363
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,194
And you are interested in your future.

364
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,748
You don't want to disappoint me. Right?

365
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,837
Go ahead. Take it.

366
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,911
That's enough. We're leaving.

367
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,071
Take your time. Think.

368
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,871
That's a lot of money for a teacher.

369
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,753
- What?
- You don't love me.

370
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,155
(He belches)

371
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,909
You only want... one thing from me.

372
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,154
No.

373
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,034
No. You try to get me... drunk.

374
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,070
You are a bad boy.

375
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,239
(Screams)

376
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,711
You're doing the right thing.

377
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,151
For who?

378
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,998
I haven't recovered my dad's body.
Pietro's dead.

379
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,031
You nearly died, too.

380
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,629
Oh, let me rephrase that. You were dead
until they resuscitated you.

381
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,150
Laura, what I'm talking about
is living my father's dream.

382
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,551
It's the Medici treasure.

383
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,751
You heard Clemenza. Nobody has even
seen this stuff in five centuries.

384
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,712
It's what my dad lived for. And died for.

385
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,750
You can't enjoy it if you're dead.

386
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,918
- The sharks, I know. I've...
- I'm not talking about the sharks, David.

387
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,428
This guy, Clemenza, he's Mafia.

388
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,755
He's worse than any shark.
He'll own you.

389
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,631
You're not going to do this.

390
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,470
If you go through with this...
you're on your own.

391
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,111
This is crazy.

392
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,397
I'm sorry.

393
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,357
I'm sorry.

394
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,030
Let's do some sightseeing.

395
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,389
Then we go home tomorrow. OK?

396
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,232
<i># Amore, dolce amore</i>

397
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,273

Don Clemenza, they are here
in San Marco Plaza.

407
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,070
We'll take this one. Thank you.

408
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,114
They are moving to the tower
in the square.

409
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,159
I will stay with them.

410
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,039
And here we have the tower of thingy.

411
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,071
And over here, too.

412
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,112
They are at the shore now.
Moving along the water.

413
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,912
- Some other beautiful things.
- Wow.

414
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,829
They are just starting to move along
the shops at the Calle della Madoneta.

415
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,557
(Man) Ferma qui.

416
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,756
Andiamo.

417
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,913
Oh!

418
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,633
- Ceramic horses. You love those.
- I do.

419
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,955
- Check 'em out.
- OK.

420
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,872
(Screams) David!

421
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,749
David!

422
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,597
(Cries of alarm)

423
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,232
- (Laura shrieks)
- No need to die, signore.

424
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,915
I asked you what you were doing.

425
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,394
- You told me you were going home.
- We were going home.

426
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,590
Well, that's a lie
cos you went to see Clemenza.

427
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,473
Two of his people showed up
and invited us to dinner.

428
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,829
- They said it was about my father.
- And?

429
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,599
- He offered me a job.
- All right. What kind of job?

430
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,359
What difference does it make,
Lieutenant? They've got Laura.

431
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,831
Some kind of an underwater excavation.
I told them no.

432
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,111
- OK, what are you hiding?
- I'm not hiding anything.

433
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,958
Mr Franks, OK, I want you
to understand one thing.

434
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,791
Here in Venezia we are very serious

435
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,195
about people that do business
with the Mafia.

436
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,038
I'm not do... This is ridiculous.

437
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,196
I to... I told them no.

438
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,596
Now, the guy who took Laura, his name
is Rossi. He works for Clemenza.

439
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,471
OK. Come on.

440
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,748
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you back to your hotel.

441
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,394
- What about Laura?
- We will look into it.

442
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,431
That's not good enough!

443
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,069
Mr Franks...

444
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,794
if you continue to resist,
I will place you under arrest.

445
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,749
Now, let's go.

446
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,915

455
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,590
- Am I under arrest?
- No, it is for your protection.

456
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,074
That's ridiculous.
You just want to keep an eye on me.

457
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,193
Well, that's right. Now I will follow up
on your fiancée for you.

478
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,351

Don't... kill me!

480
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,755
You're already dead!

481
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,199
No!

482
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,154
- Santana.
- Where is that?

483
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,553
It's a boat...

484
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,194
on the edge of...
Del Piero lagoon.

- Hello.
- <i>I thought you were smart. I was wrong.</i>

489
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,636
(Man) Welcome back, signore.

490
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,031
Up the stairs.

491
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,753
- We've been waiting for you, Mr Franks.
- Where is she?

492
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,870
I'll ask the questions here.

493
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,309
My bambina. Beautiful, isn't she?

494
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,316
- I brought all of them to Venice.
- You out of your mind?

495
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,835
Too many people want to dive here.

496
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,633
- So you feed 'em to sharks?
- It works.

497
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,319
I put bambino sharks into the canal.

498
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,158
They grow up and cannot get out.

499
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,668
They are my... How you say?

500
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,278
Cane da guardia.

501
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,514
That's it. My watchdogs.

502
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,154
And you knew this might kill my father,
didn't you?

503
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,637
- He was wasting my time. And money.
- You son of a...

504
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,958
I don't have time for chitchat!

505
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,310
You bring us the treasure
or you never gonna see her again.

506
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,430
I wanna see her right now.

507
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,632
Amore.

508
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,471
I understand.

509
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,997
Bring her in.

510
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,119
Oh... I think you know my friend...

511
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,557
Lieutenant Totti.

512
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,357
I should have known.

513
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,999
Bring me the treasure
or I'm going to kill her.

514
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,997
Nice and slow, but I'm going to kill her.

515
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,031
And I'm going to enjoy it.

516
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,032
I cannot waste more times.
My bambina attract too much attention.

517
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,709
Now mayor called the coastguard.
You got an hour.

518
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,433
You will lead Carlo e Rossi to il tesoro.

519
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,075
You bring me the treasure, you go free.
You don't...

520
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,710
I feed her to the sharks.

521
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,917
It's all silent.

522
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,557
- Where are you going?
- I'd like to say goodbye to Laura.

523
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,033
Bye.

524
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,911
Baby, you all right?

525
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,752
- David...
- Don't cry.

526
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,910
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

527
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,557
- Please be careful.
- I will.

528
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,750
(Clemenza) OK, time to go.

529
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,791
Don't you dare touch her.

530
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,596
Bring me il tesoro.

531
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,356
(Totti) It's all right.

532
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,357
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

533
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,792
<i>(Clemenza) Franks,</i>
<i>do you know where you're going?</i>

534
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,751
<i>Yes. Just stay with me.</i>

535
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,115
Just remember, Mr Franks,
I have the girl.

536
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,958
Don't confuse my kindness
with weakness.

537
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,271
<i>(Rossi) Wait. It's too small.</i>
<i>There's not enough room.</i>

538
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,914
<i>(David) There's plenty of clearance.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

539
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,031
<i>(Rossi) This better not be a trap.</i>

540
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,514
<i>Come on, Carlo.</i>
<i>You're falling behind.</i>

541
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,071
<i>(Carlo) Rossi, where are you?</i>

542
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,951
<i>I see you, Rossi!</i>

543
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,797
<i>(Screaming)</i>

544
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,871
I think we lost Carlo.

545
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,230
I don't fucking pay you to think.
Get them back on.

546
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,079
Move.

547
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,239
<i>(Rossi) Carlo, where are you?</i>
<i>Answer me.</i>

548
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,759
<i>Franks! A shark!</i>

549
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,871
<i>(David) I see it. Don't move.</i>

550
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,917
<i>There could be more!</i>

551
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,757
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

552
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,120
I screwed up. I saved you.

553
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,191
OK. Thank you.

554
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,754
Stay close.
There's nothing but traps in here.

555
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,839
Don Vito, we've found it.

556
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,352
It's fantastico.

557
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,876
Il tesoro di Medici.

558
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,234
Make a map and then bring back all you
can.

559
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,119
L'americano?

560
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,470
- You know what to do.
- No! You promised!

561
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,516
It's nothing personal, signora.

562
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,151
Think about what you're doing, Rossi!

563
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,634
What are you gonna do?
Fight that shark alone?

564
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,671
Maybe I'll take my chances.

565
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,399
(Groans)

566
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,878
Rossi! Rossi, come in!

567
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,079
(Gurgles)

568
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,831
Rossi.

569
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,711
Rossi, answer me!

570
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,308
Vaffanculo!
Vincente, Zaneri, go to kill that bastard.

571
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,599
Let's go.

572
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,913
Jump.

573
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,398
Vincente. Zaneri.

574
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,919
Come in!

575
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,951
Where the fuck are they?

576
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,795
(Bullets ricocheting)

577
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,669
(Screams)

578
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,995
You are going to be in heaven
in just a moment.

579
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,554
But first I'm going to put you through hell.

580
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,391
You appear to be in a great hurry,
Dr Franks.

581
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,555
I assure you there is nowhere to go.

582
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,591
All your men are dead, Clemenza.

583
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,428
- Where is my fucking treasure?
- Let her go or you can find it for yourself.

584
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,835
You are in no position to negotiate.

585
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,156
I said let her go! I'm the only one
that knows its location.

586
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,757
My patience is running thin.

587
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,199
- Giuseppe Canal. E block.
- Thank you, Doctor. That will be all.

588
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,957
- Come on.
- (Gunshot)

589
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,834
Stop! What... What are you doing?

590
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,474
Drop it. Enough with the killing.

591
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,478
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just drop your fucking gun.

592
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,557
- I gave you a living.
- Not any more.

593
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,875
You... are going to shoot me?

594
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,115
You... puttana!

595
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,116
- Shoot me.
- Don't try me.

596
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,789
You have gone too far.
Too many people have died.

597
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:38,037
Now drop your fucking gun.
This is your last warning.

598
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,595
(Gunshot)

599
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,192
(Groans)

600
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,039
(Siren)

601
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,597
Avanti! Avanti!

602
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,238
Andiamo! Andiamo!

603
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,837
Via, via, via!

604
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,197
Presto! Presto!

605
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,596
This is Captain Bonasera.

606
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,676
Put your weapons down.

607
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,432
Andiamo, andiamo.

608
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,310
(Speaks in Italian)

609
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,519
Andiamo!

610
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,279
(Siren)

611
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,150
This is your last warning.
Put your weapons down.

612
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,757
(In Italian)

613
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,357
<i>(Italian over megaphone)</i>

614
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,639

615
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,279

616

(Yells)

617
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,508
Arresti! Arresti!

618
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,879
(Screams)

619
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,591
Is she gonna be all right, Captain?

620
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,949
The doctor say she will recover.

621
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,036
She saved our lives.

622
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,595
Lieutenant Totti
said she had something to confess.

623
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,552
Something... you could corroborate.

624
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,273
I'm sorry you had to get involved
in all this.

625
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,756
- It never meant to get this far.
- You just get better, OK?

626
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,794
And what is it? This confession.

627
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,437
Well, Captain, it seems Lieutenant Totti...

628
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,994
shot one of Clemenza's men
and saved our lives.

629
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,917
And if you ask us...

630
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,916
she's a hero.

631
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,558
I see.

632
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,910
I will put that in my report.

633
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,473
Thank you, Captain.

634
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,073
Mr Franks.

635
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,718
Signorina.

636
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,151
And one last thing, Mr Franks.

637
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,237
I know, Captain.
There are no sharks in Venice.

638
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,951
Oh, I almost forgot.

639
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,197
How do you think...

640
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,678
this is gonna look with a wedding dress?

641
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,598
- Come here.
- It's beautiful.

642
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,272
Let's see.

643
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,311
But promise me one thing.

644
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,679
Anything.

645
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,007
We will not
honeymoon in Venice.

646
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,554
