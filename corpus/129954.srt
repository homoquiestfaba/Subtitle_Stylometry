1
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:07,644
<i>It was on Skaro that my old enemy,
the Master, was put on trial.</i>

2
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:12,092
<i>They say he listened calmly
as his list of evil crimes was read</i>

3
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,245
<i>and sentence passed.</i>

4
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:18,567
<i>Then he made his last,
and I thought curious, request.</i>

5
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:24,127
<i>He demanded that I, the Doctor,
a rival Time Lord,</i>

6
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:28,493
<i>should take his remains back
to our home planet - Gallifrey.</i>

7
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:32,329
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

8
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:40,054
<i>It was a request
they should never have granted.</i>

9
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:51,929
<i>The Time Lord has 13 lives
and the Master had used all of his.</i>

10
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:54,768
<i>But rules
had never meant much to him,</i>

11
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:58,450
<i>so I stowed his remains safely
for the voyage back.</i>

12
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,493
<i>Even in death, I didn't trust him.</i>

13
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:12,010
There, that should do it.

14
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,933
<i>In all my travels
through space and time,</i>

15
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:21,768
<i>and nearing the end
of my seventh life,</i>

16
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:26,167
<i>I was beginning to realise
you could never be too careful.</i>

17
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:36,331
<i>..it was a beautiful sight</i>

18
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:43,251
<i>Your kiss was a flame</i>

19
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:48,807
<i>Not the spot that somehow dies...</i>

20
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:56,329
<i>..embraced</i>

21
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:04,083
<i>Was real as all those tears
I cried...</i>

22
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:13,246
<i>..Each time I wake</i>

23
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:18,807
<i>Knowing that you're not here</i>

24
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:23,166
<i>But what can I do?</i>

25
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:26,973
<i>Time...time...</i>

26
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:33,085
<i>Time...time...time...time...</i>

27
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:57,326
<i>Funny how things...how things...
how things...</i>

28
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,973
Oh, no.

29
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:16,974
Hey, where are you going?
Come back here, man!

30
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,414
Wimp!

31
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:30,573
Did you see it blow?

32
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,445
Say your prayers, Lee.

33
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:44,924
What WAS that thing?!

34
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:11,924
Timing...malfunction...

35
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,251
I'll get you an ambulance.

36
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,408
Stop it!

37
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:28,533
Stop IT!

38
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:32,368
What?

39
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:39,088
Hold in there, old guy.
Chang Lee will help you.

40
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,365
HEY, OVER HERE!

41
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,765
- Were you with him?
- We were just passing.

42
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:03,289
Is he rich? He'd better be. Here.

43
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,606
- I'm not signing!
- Sign, or we can do nothing.

44
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:09,446
What's the date?

45
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:13,091
- December 30th.
- Nineteen ninety-nine.

46
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:50,646
Gunshot wounds. Heart's going
crazy. Must've taken something.

47
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,765
- Two hearts...?!
- One bullet in his shoulder.

48
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,206
No damage.
The other two are in his left leg.

49
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,128
Look, two hearts!

50
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,605
As if!
It's a double exposure, Curtis.

51
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:56,734
- Let's get these bullets out.
- One went straight through.

52
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:29,608
- Heart's still going like crazy.
- We'll get Cardiology.

53
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:34,491
- Who is on tonight?
- Amazing Grace.

54
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,290
I gotta go.

55
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,653
- Fibrillation at 300.
- 300?!

56
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:23,091
- X-rays?
- Double exposed every time we try.

57
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,485
- Try again.
- We're getting another machine up.

58
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:30,454
- No, we don't have time!
- Dr Holloway, it's Brian.

59
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:32,844
Yeah, Brian. I'm sorry!

60
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:36,974
I am on call.
Do you expect me to ignore it?

61
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:42,847
No, Brian, don't say that.
Just wait until I get home.

62
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,334
Brian?

63
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,294
Sorry.

64
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,531
Probe.

65
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,287
Scalpel.

66
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,730
And...straight to track four.

67
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,568
Track four coming up.

68
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,654
Puccini...

69
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:13,130
Madame Butterfly.

70
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,445
What you're about to do, stop!

71
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,373
You will be all right.

72
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,487
No! I am not human.
I am not like you!

73
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:23,969
Nobody is.

74
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:26,848
I need a beryllium atomic clock!

75
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:30,365
This is 1999, isn't it?

76
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,168
We can't wait any longer, Grace.

77
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,730
No, I'm not human! I'm not human!

78
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,646
Try not to speak, Mr Smith.

79
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,370
We've taken out the bullets.
Now we're finding out

80
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:48,447
why your heart is so wild.
I'll fix it.

81
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:53,285
You'll be fine. OK...he's under.

82
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:58,615
Timing malfunction!
The Master! He's out there.

83
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,454
Scalpel.

84
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,610
I've GOT to stop him!

85
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:17,687
Somehow I don't think
this man's name is Mr Smith, do you?

86
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,647
And here we have
an electro-physiology

87
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,933
being performed by
a senior cardiologist, Dr Holloway,

88
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:30,327
who will insert a micro probe
into the patient's artery,

89
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:34,090
then search out the part
causing the fibrillation.

90
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:38,851
And so you know your money is well
spent, we'll blast it with lasers.

91
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:41,893
Is Brian threatening to leave again?

92
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,728
He won't. ..That's strange.

93
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,051
- What?
- Déja vu.

94
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:50,491
- Where am I?
- Er...sub clavian.

95
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:54,005
I should be in the broncheo-cephalic.

96
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,404
Not unless this man's a donkey.

97
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,850
Then I am lost.

98
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,725
Let me try something.

99
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,767
Seizure! Get that probe out!

100
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,174
I'm trying!

101
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,168
- Picture's out!
- Damn it!

102
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,724
We're dropping off fast!

103
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:21,686
I can't get it out!

104
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,767
He's flatlining!

105
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:28,052
The probe snapped. It's still in!

106
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,046
CLEAR!

107
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,891
CLEAR!

108
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,167
CLEAR!

109
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:00,166
It's no good.

110
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,204
Time of death?

111
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,684
10.03.

112
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:12,287
I want to see his X-rays NOW!

113
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:21,929
This is all his stuff. There's no
identification there, either.

114
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,768
Tag him John Doe
and book an autopsy.

115
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:29,167
Maybe the kid who brought him in
can help with identification.

116
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,093
Doctor?

117
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,972
Sure.

118
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:42,089
This is no double exposure.

119
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,413
Sir?

120
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,611
Hmm? Yeah, I'm up.

121
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:54,414
Could you come with me, please?

122
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:04,245
You're the doctor?

123
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:09,125
Yeah. Yes, I am.
Are you a friend of Mr Smith's?

124
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:11,285
Yeah. Is he OK?

125
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:16,495
Actually, there were complications
and I'm afraid he didn't make it.

126
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,288
Sorry.

127
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:23,163
It's OK. I'll tell his family.
Are these his things?

128
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,007
Yeah.

129
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,450
I'll take them.

130
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,844
WE should contact the family.

131
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,290
No, this'll hit them hard. I will.

132
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,844
- You don't know him at all!
- I do!

133
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,654
- Then tell me his real name.
- Gotta go!

134
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:40,413
Wait!

135
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,726
SOMEBODY STOP HIM!

136
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:22,205
Shut up...

137
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:24,570
..Bruce, please!

138
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:16,531
- Doing anything New Year's Eve?
- Costume party.

139
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,846
- Me, too. Who you going as?
- Wild Bill Hickock.

140
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,290
Cool... Who's that?

141
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:26,528
John Doe on the toe!

142
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:30,290
We've got a nice autopsy
booked for you tomorrow,

143
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:35,324
followed by a sauna or herbal wrap.
What's your pleasure?

144
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,451
One a.m.

145
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:40,607
Hey, it's December 31st, 1999.

146
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:42,413
PARTY ON!

147
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:56,926
Sweet dreams.

148
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,608
Look out!

149
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,168
<i>It's alive! It's alive!</i>

150
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:22,884
<i>IT'S ALIVE! In the name of...</i>

151
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,011
<i>I know it! I KNOW IT!</i>

152
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:30,805
Hey, Ted, is that you?

153
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,727
Hello?

154
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:53,971
Who's there?

155
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:16,286
Oh, my GOD!

156
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,206
GOD, NO!

157
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:50,054
ARGH!

158
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,525
Who am I?

159
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,293
Who am I?

160
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:13,894
WHO...AM...I?!

161
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:18,492
Weird.

162
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:25,089
I must find the Doctor.

163
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:27,450
This body won't last long.

164
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,004
I need the Doctor's body.

165
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:36,963
Hmm, a sense of humour,
no more snoring?

166
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:41,765
You don't need a doctor.
Come back to bed, honey.

167
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:44,932
My name is not honey.

168
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:49,213
Well, what would you
like me to call you?

169
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,729
Master will do.

170
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:55,934
Well, come back to bed...master.

171
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:18,483
Oh, Doctor, soon I will have
all your lives.

172
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:20,645
It wasn't the same guy!

173
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:23,169
It was the guy who stole the body.

174
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:27,647
He was in a shroud
with a JD tag on his toe.

175
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:30,886
I don't think the Second Coming
happens here.

176
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,365
You think he's gonna go
to a better HOSPITAL?!

177
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,730
Know what? I'm going home.

178
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,933
Pete, stop by Psychiatric
and get MORE mind-altering drugs.

179
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:42,528
OK, sure.

180
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:11,892
Curtis, can you get SFPD? Some
creep's made off with the John Doe.

181
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:23,691
Don't call the police yet, Curtis.
Grace, can you give me some time?

182
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:25,766
Time...

183
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:36,333
..time!

184
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:41,573
..time!

185
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:49,247
We don't need to advertise
our mistakes, do we?

186
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:51,769
What are you saying?

187
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:55,325
Two hearts. No wonder you got lost.

188
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:57,007
Exactly.

189
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:01,646
Or maybe this really WAS
a double exposure.

190
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:04,966
In either case,
we can't afford to lose you.

191
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:08,411
- What are you doing?
- What I should have last night.

192
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:14,013
Am I having a bad dream?! I lose
a patient and then I lose his body

193
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:16,131
and you destroy the proof...

194
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,967
That you were careless!

195
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:21,650
- NO! I didn't know...
- He died because you got lost!

196
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:25,011
You BET I did!
The guy had two hearts!

197
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:29,327
Without records, no-one need know
he was even here.

198
00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:32,885
- You can't do this!
- Let me take care of it, Grace.

199
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,494
NO!

200
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:40,891
Believe me, I know
what is best for all of us.

201
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,888
But what WAS he?
How can we learn from him?

202
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,966
I've got to find his body!

203
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,330
I have to keep this hospital open.

204
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:51,567
No! No. If you do this...

205
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:54,566
..I'll quit.

206
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:57,930
You don't mean that.

207
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:13,085
Hold the elevator.

208
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:30,494
Puccini!

209
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:33,043
We've met before.

210
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:37,094
- I don't think so.
- Yes, I think so. I know you.

211
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:40,611
You're tired of life
but afraid of dying.

212
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:44,484
There was music - Madame Butterfly!

213
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:47,726
You were there!
I SAW you last night!

214
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:49,134
Wasn't me!

215
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:51,683
I don't know who I am,
but YOU know me!

216
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:54,528
- Please go away!
- You're my only hope!

217
00:31:54,615 --> 00:31:59,006
- Do you know who I am?
- I don't CARE who you are!

218
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:01,848
You must help me! You're a doctor!

219
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:06,372
Well, my oath just expired!
Stand back!

220
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:25,611
ARGH! GET OUT!

221
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,413
It's my hearts!

222
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:31,725
There's something in here!

223
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:36,966
It can't be!

224
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:39,126
WHAT is this?!

225
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:45,611
Please...please, I have two hearts!

226
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:51,805
You have to get me out before they
kill me again! Please, help! DRIVE!

227
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,128
Hey, Bruce, why the shades?

228
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,525
I had a bad night.

229
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:26,565
Did you want something?

230
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:29,613
Where's the gunshot wound
I brought in?

231
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,208
He died.

232
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:36,165
Oh, yeah. Well, I've got orders
to move his body.

233
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:43,843
Where is it? His body?

234
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:47,530
Haven't you heard?
The body's gone. Stolen.

235
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:49,685
OK, where are his things?

236
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:52,244
Kid that brought him in took them.

237
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:54,246
The Asian child.

238
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:56,485
The Asian child?

239
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:58,725
Bruce, you're sick!

240
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:01,011
Thank you.

241
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:13,374
- Are you all right?
- Better, yes.

242
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:17,892
Now that I don't have primitive
wiring in my system.

243
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,374
Primitive.

244
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,205
I don't believe it!

245
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:27,168
- He's taken all his stuff!
- Who?

246
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:29,610
- Brian!
- Your boyfriend?

247
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:32,243
EX-boyfriend!

248
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:36,328
Have a seat.
I want to listen to your heart.

249
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:38,451
Hearts...

250
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:42,005
- plural.
- Right! Right...

251
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:46,050
He's taken the sofa!

252
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:51,445
Come on, follow me.

253
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:55,249
Now I'm remembering more!

254
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:57,327
Lovely view.

255
00:34:57,415 --> 00:35:00,532
Maybe you have amnesia
brought on by shock.

256
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,606
Maybe. I can't remember.

257
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:10,529
Ah, Da Vinci! He had a cold
when he drew that.

258
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:15,689
- You're still fibrillating badly.
- No, I'm not. Here.

259
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:24,572
Puccini... I REMEMBER!
I was with him before he died!

260
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,054
Name dropper.

261
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:29,207
No, I was! I was, I was.

262
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,286
Oh, my God!

263
00:35:33,455 --> 00:35:36,367
See, no echo.
He didn't finish Turandot.

264
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:41,484
Alfano finished it based
on his notes. It was so sad.

265
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:44,089
You have TWO hearts!

266
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,526
Who ARE you?

267
00:35:48,695 --> 00:35:53,450
The anaesthetic almost destroyed
the regenerative process.

268
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:56,049
Oh, yeah...right...

269
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:01,965
I'm gonna get a syringe,
take some blood.

270
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:04,171
No, no, Grace, Grace...

271
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:06,087
I have 13 lives.

272
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:10,294
Please! You're telling me
you've come back from the dead?

273
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,774
Yes.

274
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:14,733
Dead stay dead.
You can't turn back time.

275
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:16,613
Yes, you can.

276
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:20,814
I'm not a child!
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

277
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:24,604
Only children believe that crap.
I...am a doctor.

278
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:28,688
But it was a childish dream
that made you a doctor.

279
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:34,529
You dreamt you could
hold back death. Isn't that true?

280
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:48,093
Don't be sad, Grace.
You'll do great things.

281
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:42,168
Hello?

282
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,213
Who's there?

283
00:37:58,015 --> 00:38:00,848
The guy from the ambulance?

284
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:05,725
Bruce, don't scare me like that.
This place is freaky enough.

285
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:09,171
Chang Lee, that's your name,
isn't it?

286
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:17,053
Well, I never!
The TARDIS really likes you.

287
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:21,049
- What are you taking about, Bruce?
- I am not Bruce.

288
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:26,004
It took me a minute with talking
and walking, but I am NOT Bruce.

289
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:29,087
I am merely...inside his body.

290
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:31,723
Oh, yeah? So, who are you really?

291
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:50,690
Give me the bag.

292
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:54,406
Yes.

293
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:57,328
Where is he?

294
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:00,612
The man you stole these from,
where is he?

295
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:02,174
He's dead.

296
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:06,374
HE'S NOT DEAD!
He has stolen MY body.

297
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:11,290
And I will die
unless we bring him back here.

298
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:14,572
You will help me do that,
understand?

299
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,726
What's in it for me?

300
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:23,334
You get to live.

301
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:50,369
Mmm, not bad. Did these belong to...?

302
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,650
Brian? Yep.

303
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:54,771
Keep 'em.

304
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:56,413
Thank you.

305
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:02,730
How's my blood?

306
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:04,851
It's not blood.

307
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:10,773
Mmm, perhaps if I walk in them,
they'll stretch a bit.

308
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:13,050
Good idea. Let's go for a walk.

309
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:20,564
Maybe you're the result

310
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:24,171
- of a genetic experiment.
- I don't think so.

311
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,974
But you have
no recollection of family?

312
00:40:27,055 --> 00:40:31,845
No. No, wait! I remember I'm
with my father, lying on the grass,

313
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:33,926
on a warm Gallifreyan night.

314
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:38,008
Gallifrey! Yes! This must be
where I live. Where is that?

315
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:41,485
Never heard of it.
What do you remember?

316
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:44,931
A meteor storm!
The sky was dancing with lights.

317
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:47,768
- Purple, green, yellow! YES!
- What?

318
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:49,812
These SHOES!

319
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,966
They fit perfectly!

320
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:06,529
You know, this was all mine
until he stole it.

321
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:09,527
He should never
have been allowed here.

322
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:11,367
I was told he was dead.

323
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:16,051
That body HAD died.
He's regenerated into another one.

324
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:18,171
My body can do this 12 times,

325
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:21,213
- but he's taken most of mine.
- What for?

326
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:25,004
- Unspeakable crimes.
- Like what?

327
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:30,084
- Ghengis Khan.
- What about him?

328
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:32,370
- That was him.
- No way!

329
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:36,971
Yes, way! Look, I'm no saint,
but he is evil.

330
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,615
And he's doing it all with MY body!

331
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:42,653
I was about to stop him
when we got here.

332
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,526
What do you want, Lee?

333
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:48,606
What do you mean?

334
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:52,654
If you could have anything -
ANYTHING - what would it be?

335
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:54,885
I don't know. A million bucks!

336
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:56,886
Only a million?

337
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,284
- OK, two million.
- Think bigger.

338
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:02,287
- A BILLION!
- What would that buy you?

339
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:05,286
- Power.
- Power.

340
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:13,927
Gold dust?

341
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:18,885
You get the rest
when I get my body back. Deal?

342
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:20,568
Deal!

343
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:27,446
Let me show you around.

344
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:31,766
Go ahead.

345
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:35,934
How did I do that?

346
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,132
I told you. The TARDIS likes you.

347
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:41,365
The Cloister Room.

348
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,890
- Awesome!
- Isn't it?

349
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:57,852
Let me show you.

350
00:43:02,335 --> 00:43:06,408
Here is the Eye of Harmony,
the heart of this structure.

351
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:09,373
Everything gets its power
from here.

352
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:10,888
How can it help us?

353
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:15,367
As you know, it used to belong
to me. Now it belongs to him.

354
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:20,245
If we can open the Eye,
we WILL find him.

355
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:23,213
Cool! So, are you gonna open it?

356
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:27,891
No, you are. Can you pull this
reflector staff from its mooring?

357
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:29,966
This thing?

358
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,845
You can do it.

359
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,813
Yes!

360
00:43:45,135 --> 00:43:47,205
Good! Now...

361
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,491
look in the beam of light.

362
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:54,331
If the TARDIS really likes you,
the Eye will open.

363
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,688
- Why don't you look?
- You pulled the staff out.

364
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:26,407
What is it?!

365
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:31,046
Something's happening!
Something's happening! God!

366
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,126
Oh, my God!

367
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:36,524
I KNOW who I am!

368
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,415
I am the Doctor!

369
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:47,692
Good! Now, do that again.

370
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,494
Wow! There's the guy
I took to hospital.

371
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,247
The Doctor's past life.

372
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:06,531
The Doctor?

373
00:45:06,615 --> 00:45:09,766
That's what he calls himself.
Doctor.

374
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:19,933
The new Doctor.
He's so young. Hmm...

375
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:24,054
Fascinating!

376
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:27,126
See that?

377
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:30,128
That's the structure
of the human eye.

378
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:33,970
The Doctor is half HUMAN!

379
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:36,852
No wonder...

380
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:39,931
- No!
- What?

381
00:45:40,095 --> 00:45:42,245
I saw him! The Master is here!

382
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,048
What are you talking about?

383
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:50,493
He plans to take my body,
so that he will live and I will die!

384
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:53,135
Oh...NO!

385
00:45:56,495 --> 00:45:59,453
He has opened the Eye of Harmony!

386
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:03,733
- What is the Eye of Harmony?
- Wait, wait!

387
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:07,969
We're seeing what he's seeing.

388
00:46:08,055 --> 00:46:11,252
I know that woman!

389
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:19,165
- Now he can't see you!
- What's the Eye of Harmony?

390
00:46:19,255 --> 00:46:23,612
Power source in the TARDIS,
my ship through time and space.

391
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:27,290
It stands for Time
And Relative Dimension In Space.

392
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,731
- The Master is a devil?
- No, a rival Time Lord.

393
00:46:30,815 --> 00:46:35,445
Evil. He was finally exterminated
by the Daleks, or so we thought.

394
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:39,414
- You really ARE insane!
- He wasn't dead! It was a trap!

395
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:41,611
If I look into the Eye...

396
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:44,573
<i>..he will take my body!</i>

397
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,647
- Listen to those lies!
- She believes him!

398
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:50,966
I don't want to deal with this!
That's enough!

399
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:55,333
If the Eye isn't closed,
this planet will be sucked through it!

400
00:46:55,415 --> 00:47:00,330
Grace, I need to fix it! I need
an atomic clock. Help me find one!

401
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:03,489
Grace...

402
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:05,247
Grace!

403
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:11,048
Grace!

404
00:47:17,055 --> 00:47:20,365
So that's how he intends to destroy me!

405
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:22,173
How?

406
00:47:22,295 --> 00:47:25,253
We must get to the Doctor
before he finds a clock.

407
00:47:25,415 --> 00:47:27,371
I know that woman!

408
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:30,368
- She operated on him.
- Find her, we find him.

409
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:37,371
GRACE!

410
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:41,448
- Stay away from me!
- Grace, please, let me in.

411
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:42,854
No!

412
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:49,130
Grace, let me in. We can sit down,
have a cup of tea, talk about it.

413
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:52,605
- Time Lord to earthling.
- Yes, I am a Time Lord.

414
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:54,766
- You were a doctor.
- I am!

415
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:59,565
I'm calling an ambulance
to take you back to Psychiatric!

416
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:06,526
Grace, if I don't get the Master
off this planet, it will not exist!

417
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:11,974
- I'm calling the ambulance!
- Grace, we have until midnight!

418
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,173
Come on, come on! Yes, I'll hold.

419
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:24,850
I'll PROVE the Eye is open!
Look at this.

420
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:26,687
Yes...

421
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:32,933
The molecular structure
of the planet is changing.

422
00:48:33,095 --> 00:48:37,964
I will need an ambulance right away.
This is Dr Grace Holloway.

423
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:42,333
At first, in subtle ways;
soon, in catastrophic ways!

424
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:49,847
I need a psychiatric bed.

425
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:53,690
By midnight, this planet
will be pulled inside out.

426
00:48:57,975 --> 00:48:59,772
Nothing will be left.

427
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:04,213
I think you'd better
make that two beds!

428
00:49:04,335 --> 00:49:06,053
Doctor, Doctor.

429
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:08,809
Come on, she needs an ambulance.

430
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:22,007
Grace...I've lost 20 pounds!

431
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,291
Congratulations.

432
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:26,366
In 20 minutes?!

433
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:29,413
You'd make a fortune
in the diet business.

434
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:33,409
<i>Now news about
a strange natural phenomena.</i>

435
00:49:33,495 --> 00:49:37,454
<i>Bay area tides break all records
for this time of year.</i>

436
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,323
<i>Flood warnings have gone out,
and in Hawaii</i>

437
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:44,532
<i>it has started snowing!</i>

438
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:46,651
<i>Links with the Millennium?</i>

439
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:53,368
<i>It is due to minute changes
in the Earth's gravitational pull.</i>

440
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:57,653
<i>Changes which happen once
every thousand years.</i>

441
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:59,088
I love humans,

442
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:03,054
always seeing patterns
in things that aren't there.

443
00:50:04,055 --> 00:50:08,207
<i>Next, where fashionable people
are bringing in the New Year.</i>

444
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,572
<i>Won't they see a clock
getting started?</i>

445
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:16,126
<i>Yes, and it isn't just any old clock.</i>

446
00:50:16,295 --> 00:50:18,286
<i>It's an atomic clock,</i>

447
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:24,052
<i>and it's at the ITAR
in downtown San Francisco.</i>

448
00:50:31,215 --> 00:50:32,534
A beryllium clock!

449
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:35,175
- They're here!
- They can take us!

450
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:51,369
We need to go to the ITAR.
Do you know where that is?

451
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:54,253
Of course I do.

452
00:51:04,455 --> 00:51:06,969
- The time?
- 10.30.

453
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:10,292
I'm on the Institute Board.
They'll listen.

454
00:51:10,455 --> 00:51:13,527
Won't this thing go any faster?!
Come on!

455
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:15,890
Can't you give him a sedative?

456
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:19,331
Why didn't you say
you had access to a clock?

457
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:22,373
- I was worried about the Eye.
- Of Harmony?

458
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:25,413
And the fact we'll be sucked
through it!

459
00:51:25,495 --> 00:51:28,328
You don't often meet a Time Lord,
Doctor.

460
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:30,486
He likes me to call him Doctor.

461
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,725
- Freudian...
- Transference.

462
00:51:32,895 --> 00:51:36,092
At least Freud
would have taken me seriously.

463
00:51:36,175 --> 00:51:38,530
- Not if he'd met you!
- We did meet.

464
00:51:38,615 --> 00:51:40,412
Right, a Time Lord.

465
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:42,566
- You knew Marie Curie?
- Yes.

466
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:44,930
- She kiss as good as me?
- As WELL.

467
00:51:51,535 --> 00:51:54,254
A truck's blocking the lanes.

468
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:06,326
The planet's about to be destroyed
and I'm in a traffic jam?

469
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:17,770
OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS IT?!

470
00:52:21,615 --> 00:52:23,128
I can't be injured!

471
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:31,171
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

472
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:37,012
Get it off me!

473
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:45,455
Sir, ma'am, get back to your vehicle.

474
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:50,605
What?! STOP! He's...he's British!

475
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:53,733
I suppose I am. Jelly baby?

476
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:55,613
Jelly baby?

477
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:58,050
Just take it.

478
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,611
Now, stand aside
before I shoot myself.

479
00:53:09,775 --> 00:53:11,447
Don't be a fool.

480
00:53:11,615 --> 00:53:14,652
- With me, Grace?
- We don't stand a chance!

481
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:17,413
Excuse me, please.

482
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:22,524
I came back to life before your eyes.
I held back death!

483
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:27,006
I can't make your dream true
forever, but I can today!

484
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:30,532
Gimme the gun.

485
00:53:40,335 --> 00:53:43,008
OK...give him the keys!

486
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:52,453
Thank you.

487
00:53:54,055 --> 00:53:56,250
What are we waiting for?

488
00:53:56,335 --> 00:54:01,170
- The road is still blocked.
- This...is...an AMBULANCE!

489
00:54:18,015 --> 00:54:22,054
Maybe I should have
kept the gun. LOOK!

490
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:27,731
DOCTOR, LOOK OUT!

491
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:34,767
BREATHE IN!

492
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,964
Don't worry.

493
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:49,608
I'm not worried.

494
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:01,810
- What are you doing?
- This way's quicker.

495
00:55:01,895 --> 00:55:04,807
- I know what I'm doing.
- Faster!

496
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:08,729
We'll let him get to the clock,
then we'll get his body!

497
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:12,649
- I think we lost them.
- Good. Hold on!

498
00:55:25,495 --> 00:55:29,773
- Know what I'll do with that gold?
- I don't want to know.

499
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:33,291
- You kill me!
- You want me to kill you?

500
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:37,050
No! I mean, you make me laugh.
You're a funny guy.

501
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:39,603
I'm glad one of us is amused.

502
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:43,404
Cheer up. You'll get your body.
We're a team, right?

503
00:55:43,495 --> 00:55:45,372
Yes, we're a team!

504
00:55:56,655 --> 00:55:58,213
NOT AGAIN!

505
00:56:02,455 --> 00:56:06,528
Great, I meet the right guy
and he's from another planet!

506
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,332
Doctor, I only have ONE life!
Can you remember that?

507
00:56:21,415 --> 00:56:24,612
- I'll try.
- Thank you!

508
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:36,973
Oh, no! Doctor, look!

509
00:56:51,695 --> 00:56:54,528
Dr Grace Holloway and guest.

510
00:56:56,015 --> 00:56:57,892
Thank you.

511
00:56:57,975 --> 00:57:01,968
First time being on the Board
has ever done me any good.

512
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:04,250
He must've found a back way in.

513
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:08,727
- Sorry, not beyond this point.
- But this is Dr Bowman.

514
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:12,126
- You'll get in later.
- I'm on the Board!

515
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,126
Thank you very much!

516
00:57:15,295 --> 00:57:17,013
Come on.

517
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:25,525
<i>Welcome to the Institute
of Technological Advancement.</i>

518
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:30,166
<i>Professor Wagg invites you
to join in celebrating the starting</i>

519
00:57:30,255 --> 00:57:35,170
<i>of the world's most accurate timepiece -
a Beryllium Atomic Clock.</i>

520
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:52,370
How will we get THAT on the bike?

521
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,810
We only need a tiny part.

522
00:57:54,975 --> 00:58:00,129
- So, time travel is possible?
- Anything is possible.

523
00:58:00,215 --> 00:58:03,252
Why can't you become
another species?

524
00:58:03,335 --> 00:58:05,451
I can, but only when I die.

525
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:07,924
And the rival Time Lord, the Master?

526
00:58:08,015 --> 00:58:13,533
He's on his last life. In a fight
for survival there are no rules.

527
00:58:13,695 --> 00:58:16,892
If I tell you a secret,
promise not to tell.

528
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:21,287
Oh, Professor Wagg! This is
Dr Bowman. He's from London.

529
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:25,607
He was just going to share
a secret with us.

530
00:58:25,695 --> 00:58:28,926
Yes. Any chance
of a closer look at the clock?

531
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:34,009
No! I'm afraid I am the only person
allowed up there.

532
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:36,928
Maybe we could bend the rules a bit?

533
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:40,246
- But you see...
- Grace says you have a secret.

534
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:41,893
What is it?

535
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:48,250
I'm half human.
On my mother's side.

536
00:58:52,135 --> 00:58:54,603
Very clever! Happy New Year.

537
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,606
Yes, I think you must be.

538
00:58:57,735 --> 00:58:59,088
Champagne?

539
00:58:59,175 --> 00:59:00,654
Grace...

540
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:07,571
This is when I wish
I had my sonic screwdriver.

541
00:59:07,655 --> 00:59:09,054
Your WHAT?

542
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:28,566
See? I told you it was small.

543
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:30,487
What is it they say?

544
00:59:30,575 --> 00:59:33,214
They say it on my planet, too.

545
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:41,645
- I know you.
- You do, huh?

546
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:48,050
Gareth, answer the SECOND question
on your mid-term, not the third.

547
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:52,094
- What?
- The SECOND. Don't forget.

548
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,133
I won't. Now, what's in your hand?

549
01:00:06,215 --> 01:00:08,331
What was that about?

550
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:13,285
Ten years from now, Gareth will
head the Seismology Task Force

551
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:16,811
and will design a system
to predict earthquakes.

552
01:00:16,895 --> 01:00:20,365
His inventions save the human race
several times,

553
01:00:20,455 --> 01:00:23,765
- but first he must pass Poetry.
- Look! The kid!

554
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:31,168
You see who he's with? Come on!

555
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:43,053
The Master?

556
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:47,728
You're lucky he only got your wrist.

557
01:00:54,095 --> 01:00:55,847
Liven things up!

558
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,928
DOOR!

559
01:01:04,015 --> 01:01:07,007
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

560
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:09,689
- Yeah.
- So am I.

561
01:01:09,855 --> 01:01:14,007
Everyone, stay calm! Remain inside!
Don't panic!

562
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:16,973
Everything is under control... OOF!

563
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:28,364
I'll seal the exits!

564
01:01:30,615 --> 01:01:32,014
DOCTOR!

565
01:01:48,015 --> 01:01:49,846
Here we go again!

566
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:55,093
- Do you know what'll happen to me?
- You don't want to know!

567
01:01:55,175 --> 01:01:57,166
- You CAN'T not tell!
- Grace!

568
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,564
God! Brian's gonna move in again!

569
01:01:59,655 --> 01:02:01,646
- I can't say.
- Please!

570
01:02:01,735 --> 01:02:06,855
It's useless to meddle with the
universe, unless you're a Time Lord.

571
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,254
All right.

572
01:02:08,335 --> 01:02:10,974
So, just give me a few pointers!

573
01:02:22,775 --> 01:02:25,369
- There she is!
- A police box?

574
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:26,774
Key!

575
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:30,689
- I leave a spare in...
- ..a compartment above the door!

576
01:02:30,775 --> 01:02:32,174
Up you go!

577
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:34,565
It's in a cubby hole above the P.

578
01:02:36,775 --> 01:02:39,335
Got it! Why a police box?

579
01:02:39,415 --> 01:02:43,488
Its cloaking device got stuck.
I like it like this.

580
01:02:43,655 --> 01:02:46,215
Doctor...

581
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:05,365
Oh, my!

582
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,526
You hear that?

583
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:09,128
Yes.

584
01:03:09,215 --> 01:03:12,173
That's a warning.
The TARDIS is dying.

585
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,644
This is AMAZING!

586
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:19,205
We don't have enough power
to move next door.

587
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,525
The beryllium chip, Grace.

588
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:23,765
- Careful.
- Yes, Doctor.

589
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:27,084
This looks pretty low-tech.

590
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:31,373
Low-tech?! This is a Type 40 TARDIS,
able to take you to any planet

591
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:35,130
at any date
in that planet's existence!

592
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:36,887
Temporal physics.

593
01:03:36,975 --> 01:03:38,647
Oh, that would explain

594
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:42,887
the spatial displacement
we experienced as we came in.

595
01:03:42,975 --> 01:03:45,045
Yes, if you like.

596
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,528
Yes!

597
01:03:54,855 --> 01:03:59,645
There! The Eye is closing.
Now...let's see.

598
01:04:01,055 --> 01:04:04,172
- Come on! Oh, no.
- What?

599
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:06,007
We may be too late.

600
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,884
- We still have 11 minutes!
- There's no context.

601
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,968
- What are you doing?
- Finding one minute past midnight.

602
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:23,527
If it's true, the Eye's been open
too long and there's no future!

603
01:04:23,695 --> 01:04:25,208
Is this reliable?!

604
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:29,083
- Closing the Eye won't help.
- Why didn't you know that?

605
01:04:29,175 --> 01:04:31,450
I haven't opened the Eye before!

606
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,412
NOW you tell me!

607
01:04:33,575 --> 01:04:38,410
We have to go back to before the Eye
was opened, before we arrived.

608
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:42,011
- This IS a time machine!
- With NO power!

609
01:04:42,175 --> 01:04:46,054
- Opening the Eye has drained it.
- Great!

610
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,490
- You MUST have power!
- Not enough!

611
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:52,284
What about the predictions
about me, about Gareth?

612
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,889
They must come from somewhere!

613
01:04:55,055 --> 01:04:57,888
Wait...wait, wait, wait!

614
01:04:58,055 --> 01:05:01,013
Are you any good
at setting alarm clocks?

615
01:05:02,295 --> 01:05:03,774
No.

616
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:06,654
- I'll try.
- Listen very carefully.

617
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:11,764
We pre-set the co-ordinates as
I divert power from the Eye to here.

618
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,371
- Jump-start the TARDIS?
- Jump-start the TARDIS!

619
01:05:15,455 --> 01:05:18,845
Hit the top switch
on the console. The top one.

620
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:22,210
Good, now pass me the neutron ram.

621
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:24,688
Grace?

622
01:05:25,775 --> 01:05:27,413
The neutron ram?

623
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:29,213
I'll show you.

624
01:05:55,735 --> 01:05:58,613
Oh, no... Oh, not you, Grace.

625
01:05:59,735 --> 01:06:02,090
This is no time to play
Doctors and Nurses!

626
01:06:02,255 --> 01:06:05,611
No good talking to her.
She's possessed.

627
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:09,404
You! You took my things.
Where are they?

628
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:11,884
They're not YOUR things any more.

629
01:06:11,975 --> 01:06:15,854
Soon, everything here will belong
to the Master again.

630
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:18,654
Again? What's he been telling you?

631
01:06:18,815 --> 01:06:22,091
When he gets his body,
I'm gonna be rich!

632
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:26,646
- And you BELIEVE him?
- Why shouldn't I?

633
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,773
There won't be anywhere left
to SPEND it!

634
01:06:31,095 --> 01:06:34,326
- So we have no time to waste.
- But time to change!

635
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:44,968
I always...DRESS for the occasion.

636
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:48,172
Glad you appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

637
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:50,007
I never liked this planet.

638
01:06:50,175 --> 01:06:54,453
Well, any minute, it'll cease
to exist! What's the time?

639
01:06:54,615 --> 01:07:00,008
Time enough for me to get my body,
get away and take Lee with me.

640
01:07:00,175 --> 01:07:04,885
Lee is the son
I have always yearned for.

641
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:08,169
Please!

642
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:14,091
Grace...put it on him.
I suspect you know how.

643
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:21,887
Lee, this is MY TARDIS,
MY Eye and my OWN body!

644
01:07:22,055 --> 01:07:25,968
The Master has run out of lives!
That's the truth.

645
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:30,128
Look at Grace! She is possessed
by EVIL, not goodness!

646
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:40,644
This won't hurt...much.

647
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,563
I didn't think I'd make it!

648
01:08:04,495 --> 01:08:06,565
My life's work!

649
01:08:06,655 --> 01:08:08,930
Ohmmmm...

650
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:11,774
Ohmmm...

651
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:22,170
In 700 years, no-one has opened
the Eye. How did you do it?

652
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:27,204
Simple. Lee is human. You are only
half. Lee, open the Eye, please.

653
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,405
Ladies and gentlemen,

654
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:37,489
in three minutes,
the world enters a new millennium

655
01:08:37,575 --> 01:08:43,366
and a new standard of accuracy
will come to how we measure TIME!

656
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,774
What do you mean, it won't start?

657
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:07,050
- Lee, this is your last chance!
- It's my ONLY chance!

658
01:09:07,215 --> 01:09:09,445
There is nothing for him here,

659
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:14,564
no family, no gang, only death.
With me, he'll see the universe.

660
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:17,772
It's his last chance to stay alive!

661
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:20,654
- What do you know of last chances?
- More than YOU!

662
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:25,013
I've wasted all my lives
because of YOU, Doctor!

663
01:09:25,175 --> 01:09:26,972
Now I'll be rid of you.

664
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:30,411
ALL your lives?
Didn't you say I'd stolen them?

665
01:09:30,575 --> 01:09:33,533
Lee, he lied!
He's used all his lives,

666
01:09:33,695 --> 01:09:38,928
so he wants mine! Like I told you,
this is MY TARDIS, MY body!

667
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:42,371
Don't believe him. Open the Eye.

668
01:09:43,815 --> 01:09:47,808
He said it himself, Lee.
He's wasted ALL of his lives!

669
01:09:51,055 --> 01:09:53,205
- OPEN THE EYE!
- NO!

670
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:56,855
You LIED to me!

671
01:10:01,815 --> 01:10:03,134
Lee...

672
01:10:04,415 --> 01:10:05,848
Lee...

673
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:09,285
..I would never lie to you.

674
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,451
I would only protect you.

675
01:10:14,215 --> 01:10:16,285
NO-O-O!

676
01:10:20,535 --> 01:10:22,526
How will you open the Eye now?

677
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:25,528
Grace, come here.

678
01:10:27,095 --> 01:10:32,169
In her present state, that won't work.
Her eyes aren't human!

679
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:35,328
Watch!

680
01:10:39,975 --> 01:10:43,012
See...now they're human.

681
01:10:44,455 --> 01:10:46,685
No, Grace! CLOSE YOUR EYES!

682
01:10:46,855 --> 01:10:49,085
Too late!

683
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,415
I'M BLIND!

684
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:04,531
Your sight will return!

685
01:11:24,015 --> 01:11:25,334
What's happening?

686
01:11:25,495 --> 01:11:30,171
He can't move while the Eye
links us! Remember, Grace!

687
01:11:30,335 --> 01:11:33,247
- Re-route the power!
- Console room, GO!

688
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:35,326
You'll die if I leave you!

689
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:38,373
We'll ALL die if you don't! RUN!

690
01:11:38,535 --> 01:11:40,844
Run, Grace!

691
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:43,495
I'm taking your lives!

692
01:11:43,655 --> 01:11:45,566
RUN!

693
01:11:59,735 --> 01:12:01,805
I can hear your thoughts, Doctor!

694
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:05,012
I can feel your memories!

695
01:12:17,975 --> 01:12:20,967
This cannot be how it ends!

696
01:12:21,055 --> 01:12:22,886
Stop this!

697
01:12:22,975 --> 01:12:24,374
Please...

698
01:12:24,455 --> 01:12:26,571
STOP!

699
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,846
God, please!

700
01:12:42,295 --> 01:12:43,967
What have I done?!

701
01:12:46,615 --> 01:12:48,412
30 SECONDS!

702
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:04,014
20...19...18...

703
01:13:17,295 --> 01:13:19,934
12...11...10...

704
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:23,653
I thought surgery was difficult!

705
01:13:23,855 --> 01:13:25,334
9...

706
01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:34,324
8...

707
01:13:34,455 --> 01:13:36,286
Routing the power!

708
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:38,207
I'm alive!

709
01:13:39,855 --> 01:13:43,086
- 7...
- I'm re-routing the power. OW!

710
01:13:43,255 --> 01:13:46,691
- 6...
- I'm alive! I'M ALIVE!

711
01:13:47,695 --> 01:13:49,333
- Time's up.
- Three!

712
01:13:49,495 --> 01:13:52,009
I AM ALIVE!

713
01:13:52,175 --> 01:13:53,767
2...

714
01:13:56,095 --> 01:13:57,414
ONE!

715
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:24,653
<i>..before we arrived.</i>

716
01:14:24,735 --> 01:14:28,694
Alarm clock, alarm clock!
Think alarm clock!

717
01:14:32,775 --> 01:14:36,654
Temporal orbit?
What's a temporal orbit?!

718
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:10,130
She did it. Your life force
is dying, Master.

719
01:15:12,415 --> 01:15:14,804
NO-O-O-O!

720
01:15:32,175 --> 01:15:34,848
We're in temporal orbit!
What is it?!

721
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:40,773
What IS that?

722
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,290
GRACE! NO-O-O!

723
01:16:02,695 --> 01:16:04,048
Grace!

724
01:16:07,215 --> 01:16:09,206
You are my life!

725
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:23,534
You want domain over the living,
yet all you do is kill!

726
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:26,050
Life is wasted on the living!

727
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:55,967
Give me your hand.

728
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:58,250
Never!

729
01:16:59,855 --> 01:17:01,083
DOCTOR!

730
01:18:52,735 --> 01:18:55,454
Doctor...I have your things.

731
01:18:58,335 --> 01:18:59,688
Hello, Grace.

732
01:18:59,855 --> 01:19:05,612
Well, how does it feel...
to hold back death?

733
01:19:23,615 --> 01:19:29,167
Incredible! Did you see that? What
a sentimental thing this TARDIS is!

734
01:19:29,255 --> 01:19:33,612
Congratulations. You've both been
somewhere I've never been.

735
01:19:33,695 --> 01:19:38,211
It's nothing to be scared of.
Did we go back far enough?

736
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:41,605
That, or you're ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts.

737
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,810
So...er...where's the Master?

738
01:19:55,975 --> 01:19:57,931
Indigestion.

739
01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:01,890
So, let's see where we are.

740
01:20:02,655 --> 01:20:05,488
There. The future.

741
01:20:05,575 --> 01:20:09,614
Look on the other side
of your galaxy. That's home.

742
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:13,450
- Gallifrey!
- 250 million light years away.

743
01:20:15,015 --> 01:20:17,973
That's a good ten minutes
in this old thing!

744
01:20:18,055 --> 01:20:20,205
So, where are we?

745
01:20:22,815 --> 01:20:26,012
December 29th.
Do you want to get off here?

746
01:20:26,095 --> 01:20:28,609
I couldn't live through that again.

747
01:20:28,695 --> 01:20:30,492
I WOULDN'T live through that again!

748
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:09,051
THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

749
01:21:18,815 --> 01:21:20,885
Happy New Year!

750
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:33,526
Happy New Year.
Can you believe it? 2000!

751
01:22:04,015 --> 01:22:06,483
Now, THAT'S as it should be!

752
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:10,333
Your things.

753
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:14,924
My sonic screwdriver! Thank you!

754
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:17,006
And...these, too.

755
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:19,086
Please, keep them.

756
01:22:19,175 --> 01:22:21,291
- Really?!
- Yes, really.

757
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:23,969
I'll go before you change your mind!

758
01:22:25,255 --> 01:22:26,654
Lee...

759
01:22:26,815 --> 01:22:31,935
next Christmas, take a vacation.
Just don't be here.

760
01:22:33,855 --> 01:22:36,289
Right! Thanks.

761
01:22:38,015 --> 01:22:39,846
Thanks, Doctor.

762
01:22:41,615 --> 01:22:45,608
See you around, Grace.
Happy New Year!

763
01:22:45,775 --> 01:22:48,164
- Interfering again!
- Grace...

764
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:50,405
- Don't tell me.
- Why not?

765
01:22:50,575 --> 01:22:53,612
I know who I am, and that's enough.

766
01:22:55,135 --> 01:22:56,932
I'm glad!

767
01:22:59,735 --> 01:23:01,691
Come with me.

768
01:23:01,855 --> 01:23:04,005
You come with me.

769
01:23:04,095 --> 01:23:06,211
- ME come with you?
- Yes!

770
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,286
Me come with you?

771
01:23:12,215 --> 01:23:14,126
It's tempting.

772
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:17,611
I'm going to miss you.

773
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:20,972
I'm easy to find.
I'm the guy with two hearts.

774
01:23:21,135 --> 01:23:23,854
That's not what I meant.

775
01:23:40,455 --> 01:23:45,813
- Thank you, Doctor.
- No, no, thank YOU, Doctor!

776
01:24:33,575 --> 01:24:39,047
Hmm, sounds better.
Right...where to next?

777
01:24:46,255 --> 01:24:48,644
Now, where was I?

778
01:24:55,135 --> 01:24:57,695
<i>..But my poor heart aches</i>

779
01:24:57,855 --> 01:25:01,291
<i>Time...time...time...</i>
Oh, no! Not again!
