00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,053
PSYCHIATRIST: So
Sam, what would you

2
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,623
like to talk about this week?

3
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,024
-You know, they've
been tracking Jack

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,327
Frost for over three years.

5
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,530
-Now Sam, I thought we
agreed last week that we're

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,932
going to try and
discuss something

7
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,668
other than the Jack
Frost incident.

8
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:39,106
-Across 11 states, 38 deaths.

9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,107
Jack was nimble.

10
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:43,143
Jack was quick.

11
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:47,247
Jack gouged eyes
with candlesticks.

12
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,284
He smashed their skulls
with sticks and stones,

13
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:54,021
used iron bars to
break their bones.

14
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:59,059
He hid his kill in
tiny places so he

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,929
wouldn't have to
see their faces.

16
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,830
Until I caught him.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,770
He was tried, convicted,
sentenced to die.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,673
And then there was the accident.

19
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:16,043
[giggling]

20
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,978
-What's that?

21
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,913
-Nothing.

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,847
Go on.

23
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,120
-As Jack was traveling
to his execution--

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,522
-(WHISPERING) Come here.
Come here.

25
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:33,694
SAM: --the vehicle that he
was in collided with a tanker.

26
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,432
The tanker contained a secret
government genetic acid.

27
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,934
Jack was dissolved
into the snow.

28
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,402
[eavesdroppers laughing]

29
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,005
-But you don't believe that
Jack Frost died, do you, Sam?

30
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,273
-Oh, no.

31
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,241
No, he didn't die.

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,076
He changed.

33
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,178
[eavesdroppers laughing loudly]

34
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:59,286
-Why don't you tell us--
me-- tell me what he became.

35
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:05,559
SAM: He became a
mutant killer snowman.

36
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,228
[hysterical laughter]

37
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,898
-And then that frost snowman
started to take apart my town.

38
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,900
-Please tell us how
you finally stopped--

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,872
[intercom shuts off]

40
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,207
-Yes, Sam.

41
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:24,645
Tell us how you finally stopped
the mutant killer snowman.

42
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,713
-With antifreeze.

43
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,048
[snorting]

44
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,183
-And what happened
to this antifreeze

45
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,253
that this mutant killer
snowman was dissolved in?

46
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,591
-We buried it in
an unmarked grave.

47
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,728
-And where is this
alleged grave?

48
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,997
-I told you before, doctor.

49
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,399
We all swore to secrecy.

50
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,100
-Yes.

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,103
So that, and as I
told you before,

52
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,273
your delusion remains intact.

53
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,076
-No.

54
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,210
So that the killing stops.

55
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,622
[music playing]

56
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,671
-You sure this is the one?

57
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,974
-Oh, well-- you sure
there's a reward?

58
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,477
-Yeah, there's a reward.

59
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,512
-Well then, this here's the one.

60
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,014
This is where they
buried that antifreeze.

61
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,923
So, uh, what you fixing on
doing with this stuff anyway?

62
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:46,193
MAN: I could tell you, but I'd
have to kill you afterwards.

63
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,361
Then again--

64
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,796
[gunshot]

65
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,037

[jack frost yawning]

68
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,538
JACK FROST: Mmm, things
to do, revenge to take.

69
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,707
Ah.

70
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,042
WOMAN (ON LOUDSPEAKER):
The flight zone

71
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:53,446
is for either loading and
unloading of passengers only.

72
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,916
No parking.

73
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,418
[sigh]

74
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,557
-Well, that's it.

75
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,592
They're late.

76
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,559
That's a sign.

77
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,694
We shouldn't be going.

78
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,829
-No, it's a sign that
there's traffic, Sam.

79
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,897
A traffic sign.

80
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,698
Get it?

81
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,499
Get it?

82
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,767
-What about Ryan?

83
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,702
-Honey, he hasn't seen
the cousins in years.

84
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,970
He'll have a wonderful time.

85
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,004
-What if he needs us?

86
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,775
-He has the number
for the hotel.

87
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,178
Sam, if you really don't
want to go, we won't.

88
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,379
-OK.

89
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,648
-But Dr. Morton said we
should get away together.

90
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,884
And you promised Joe you
would be his best man.

91
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:35,622
-Do you know It was exactly
a year ago that it happened?

92
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,990
-Yeah.

93
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,993
And that's why we should be
somewhere else for Christmas,

94
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,761
somewhere with no memories.

95
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,562
Yeah?

96
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,863
-Hey, guys!

We're late.

103
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,138
Oh, thank you.

104
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,139

-Colonel.

Another beauteous
day in heaven, eh?

117
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,438
-Yes, indeed.

-This is so cool.

120
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,517
-I can't believe
we're here, you guys.

121
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,618
-Ah.

122
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,288
Now-- now, that's Rose,
Ashlea, and Paisley.

123
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,423
Here we go.

124
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,291
First vacation
without the parents.

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,127
Now-- now, they think they're
looking for adventure.

126
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,096
However, what
they'll discover is

127
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,731
the true meaning of friendship.

128
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,965
-Isn't that sweet.

129
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,934
-Look at this light.

130
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,903
You can slit my throat
now, I've seen it all.

-Oh, I say.

Oh, so scrumptious, eh?

133
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,674
Now-- now, they're here
on a calendar shoot.

134
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,676
-Are you sure this
is all-inclusive?

135
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,211
-That's right.

136
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,779
-All the food we can eat?

137
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,215
-Honey, you can purge
to your heart's delight.

138

Mmm, put that big
tiki in my room.

-Oh, no, no, don't tell me.

They're going to discover a
whole "beauty more than skin

142
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:49,889
deep" thing?

143
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,291
-Absolutely, yes.

144
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,492
-This is so great.

145
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,028
They're gonna have archery
and karaoke and a party.

146
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:55,829
And there's snorkeling.

147
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,663
Ah!

148
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,764
A free buffet for you, Honey!

149
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,731
-Oh, free buffet!

150
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,766
-Honey, I hate karaoke.

151
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,700
-Oh, Honey.

152
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,101
-Yeah.

153
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,471
You know, Colonel, not everybody
has to have a nice story, man.

154
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,207
Some of these people, they're
just here on vacation, man.

155
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,541
-Absolutely not.

156
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,543
Everyone here for a reason, yes.

157
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,778
Mark my words.

158
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,579
A-ha.

161
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,418
Yes.

162
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,820
You must be the Fosters.

163
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,788
-Not yet.

164
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,589
-Oh.

165
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,022
No.

166
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,423
Quite.

167
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,357
No.

168
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,025
Here for the jolly
old wedding, eh?

169
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,294
Well, welcome to
the Tropicana, eh?

170
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,396
Your last resort
before paradise.

171
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,965
Now, I'm the colonel.

172
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,701
You have any problems,
you come to me at once.

173
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:39,305
I want your stay here to be
everything short of heaven.

174
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,941
Well, you'll be in
our honeymoon suite.

175
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,643
-Let's go look at our room.

176
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,611
-Yes.

177
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,979
And you, sir?

178
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,447
-Uh, we're the Tilers.

179
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,281
-Oh, yes.

180
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,582
Here for your second honeymoon.

181
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,617
-Oh, no, no, no.

182
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,718
We're just here to relax.
-Oh.

183
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,819
Oh, no, no.

Is Ben the cute one?

372
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,859
Dibs on Ben!

373
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,576
JACK FROST: Bombs away.

374
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,311
Oh, for crying out loud.

375
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,579
OK, OK, OK.

376
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,380
Here we go again.

377
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,317
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

378
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,318
I must be out of practice.

379
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,256
Oh, fuck it!

380
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:26,432
[birds squawking]

381
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,900
-Did you hear something?

382
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,435
-She probably just
dropped the charcoal.

383
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,739
Ash, you need a hand?

384
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,776
-She's so--

385
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,710
-Oh, I know.

386
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,981
I'll help her out.

387
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,255
Hey, Ash.

389
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:12,978
-Guys?

390
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:16,916
Come on, guys.

391
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,889
Ash, Paise, this isn't funny.

392
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,124
Come on, you can
come out now, OK?

393
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,096
JACK FROST: Ooh, tongs.

394
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm so scared.

395
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,398
I don't know whether
to shit myself

396
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,233
or grab the barbecue sauce.

397
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,634
[cackling]

398
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,069
-Who are you?

399
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,071
JACK FROST: Winter.

400
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,473
-Get away from me!

401
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,807
JACK FROST: Ooh, feisty.

402
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,042
I like it.

403
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,610
-Where are you?

404
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,678
JACK FROST: Oh baby, I'm here.

405
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,214
Or maybe I'm not.

406
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,015
Maybe I'm here.

407
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,016
Here!

408
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,954
Or maybe-- I'm right here.

409
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,188
Yeah.

00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,938
-Up and at 'em.

-Hi.

414

416
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,548

417
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,684
-Captain Fun is chasing
away the hangover grumps.

418
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,486
-What is going on?

419
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,857
-Mrs. Tiler, this is no time
to be a jet-lagged slacker.

420
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,958
Come on, you two.

421
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,759
-Away!

422
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,960
-Oh.

423
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,562
Hope your aim is that
good on the archery range.

424
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,598
-Get out of our bed.

425
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,300
Oh.

426
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,835
-Well, how about I
just hurry over there,

427
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,070
give you a morning hug,
then come back over here.

428
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,871
-No.

429
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,180
-Honey, we sleep
together at home.

430
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,449
-But we're not home,
are we, Sweetums?

431
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,752
-This place, this
is so romantic.

-Oh, you don't want to ruin
Peach Bottom's wedding night,

433

now do you, Sweetums?

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,691
-No.

435
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,593
-So you stay over there, OK?

436
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,394
OK.

raisins, Bobby.

Mmm, yes.

Needs a dash of paprika,
oregano, and a hint of roses.

441
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,890
What have we here?

442
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,124
Oh, yes.

443
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,827
Fruit salad needs
some orange, Bobby.

444
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,197
Oh wow, what a spread.

445
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,398
Oh, this is living.

446
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,766
It wasn't like this
in India, you know.

447
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,103
Lucky if you got a plate of
cold rice for breakfast then.

-Damsel in distress
on the beach.

Look lightly, lad.

451

-No, no, no, man.

452
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,947
You don't go running
toward the screaming.

453
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,416
Didn't your mother ever
teach you nothing, man?

454
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,419
-All right, all right,
nothing to be alarmed about.

455
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,489
Look, whatever it is, I've
seen it all before, yes.

456
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,791
Back in India, I had to saw
my best friend's leg off

457
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,062
with a broken tea cup
and use it as a weapon.

458
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,398
Oh.

459
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,233
Take your point.

460
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,102
Grisly sight.

461
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,305
You two, uh, staying
in the hotel?

462
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,539
Well, excellent, excellent.

463
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,942
Well, uh, how about your
room service bill is on us,

464
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:34,480
and you, uh-- you
never saw a thing, eh?

465
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,281
Yeah?

466
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:35,948
Excellent.

467
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:36,582
Excellent.

on somebody's head?

of island security.

-Yes.

476

The scary dude.

477
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,667
-Not so fast.

478

MV on the beach.

Uh, you've lost me.

00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,718
Nonsense.

00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,129
-Yes, yes.

Yes, everyone's--
everyone's fine, yes.

496
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,932
Slight, um, accident.

497
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,702
Nothing serious.

498
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,502
-There's a body?

499
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,370
-It's just a--

500
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,171
-Murder.

501
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:32,971
-Coconut.

502
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,040
-Shark attack.

503
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,645
-Another attack of the
murderous coconut shark.

504
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,746
-Uh, yes, sir.

505
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,348
Well, this is our head
of island security.

506
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,717
This is, um-- this is Manners.

507

Used to be with the FBI.

508

-Agent Manners?

509
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,456
-Well, you must
have me confused.

510
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,324
-I'm Manners, head
of island security.

511
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,125
-No, no, no.

512
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,393
Last year, in Snomonton--

513
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,828
-Trust me, Sheriff.

514
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,962
You've got the wrong guy.

515
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,731
-Well then, how do you
know that I'm a sheriff?

516
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,198
Uh-huh?

517
00:24:59,198 --> 00:24:59,665
Ha, ha.

518
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,599
Ha, ha.

519
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,101
-Look at me.

520
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:02,901
Look at my face.

521
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,237
Look what he did to my face.

522
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,273
15 operations to
make it like this.

523
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,810
His icicle fangs
and his pointy nose.

524
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,747
I live on an island
now, and there's never,

525
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,250
ever any snowmen, and
I'm very, very happy.

526
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,218
Do you get it?

527
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:19,718
-I got it.

528
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:20,519
I got it.

529
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm sorry.

530
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,421
Whatever you say.

531
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,056
-No problem.

532
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:28,227
Now we've got us a coconut shark
to catch, if you don't mind.

533
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,028
-Yes, yes.

534
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,396
Jolly good idea, yes.

535
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,964
Back to business, everybody.

536
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,467
Uh, Mr. Tiler, I believe they're
serving a breakfast buffet.

537
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,268
Yes, sir.

538
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,035
-Yeah.

539
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,438
Yeah, sure.

540
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,874
You have a lot of shark
attacks around here?

541
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,777
-Not really, but--
'tis the season.

542
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,285
-Right, you'd better contact the
authorities on the big island

543
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,288
and give them the
lay of the land.

544
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,590
And, uh, Bobby, play it down.

545
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,726
It's nothing significant.

546
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,128
-Colonel Hickering, I
don't like this situation.

547
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,197
We'll have to warn the guests.

548
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,598
-Absolutely not.

549
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,434
If something like this gets
out, before you know it,

550
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,703
the whole place is closed down,
and you'll be out of a job.

551
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,572
-Colonel, you've got a
murderer on the loose.

552
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,373
-Nonsense.

553
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,708
Shark attack.

554
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,112
And a very nasty
cooking accident.

555
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,780
-Cooking?

556
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,015
-Now, look.

557
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,217
There's no need for alarm
until the authorities

558
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,318
tell us otherwise.

559
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,620
God, back in India,
there was Punjab volleys

560
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,856
that killed 150 of
us before the CO even

561
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,925
gave the order for
us to get out of bed.

562
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,194
-Colonel, problem.

563
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,062
The phone line is dead.

564
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,230
-What?

565
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,232
God, if it's not one
thing, it's another today.

566
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,166
Right.

567
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,501
Let's go and see
to the satellite.

568
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,302
Come on.

569
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,270
Chop-chop.

570
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,439
-The satellite's out?

571
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,974
Nothing suspicious about that.

572
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,546
JACK FROST: Aw, phone
line's dead, huh?

573
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,881
Let's see.

574
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,816
Who's next?

575
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,784
[chuckling]

576
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,689
-No.

577
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,190
No.

578
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,991
Yes.

579
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,173
Oh!

580
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:24,176
Well, there's your problem.

581
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,879
This little guy done
gone skinny dipping.

582
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,580
-Well, can you fix it?

583
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,515
-Oh no, man.

584
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,016
This a ex-satellite.

585
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,918
We need to be ordering a
whole sack of spare parts

586
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,052
to fix this.

587
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,555
-And how do you propose
we call to order them?

588
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:40,425
-The supply boat will be
here first thing tomorrow.

589
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:44,263
-So until then,
we're on our own.

590
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,164
Right.

591
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,065
Chin up.

592
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,701
Eyes alert.

593
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,704
-Because friends don't let
friends drink and surf.

594
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,140
So you finish that
daiquiri first, OK?

595
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,141
-Captain Fun.

596
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,876
Come-- come on in,
for goodness sake.

597
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,044
And you, Kitty.

598
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,446
Good heavens, I've
called a meeting here.

599
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:05,217
Now, it seems we have a slight
spot of bother on our hands

600
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,285
here.

601
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,321
-You have a murderer
loose on the island.

602
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,323
-Not the case at all.

603
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,224
-Hello?

604
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,392
Can we get a drink?

605
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,259
-Yeah, where is everybody?

606
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,894
-I don't know.

607
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,262
They said service not included.

608
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,797
I guess they really meant it.

609
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,233
[chuckling weakly]

610
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,167
-Anybody here?

611
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,068
-Hello?

612
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:23,969
-Hello?

613
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,304
-Bobby?

614
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,306
-Now, we all know
that Mr. Manners

615
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,007
here is prone to overreaction.

616
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:29,975
Yes.

617
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,543
I-- I think we can,
uh-- we can all

618
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,680
remember the Colombian
invasion affair.

619
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,982
-You've got three
bodies, no explanations.

620
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,150
Add that up.

621
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,751
It spells trouble.

622
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,686
-Why aren't the police here?

623
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,955
-The satellite's out.

624
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:46,058
Now, I suggest you
round up your guests,

625
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,826
lock them down, and
put the squeeze on them

626
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,528
until someone squeals.

627
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,929
-Hey.

628
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:55,467
Now, these people came here for
a taste of island hospitality.

629
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,035
There will be no
squeezing or squealing

630
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,937
on my watch, Mr. Fun-sucker.

631
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,238
-Precisely.

632
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,441
No proof of anything
nasty anyway.

633
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:03,909
Put it all in the past.

634
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,178
Jolly good time had by all, eh?

635
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:06,945
Splendid plan.

636
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:07,746
Off we go.

637
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,914
Show those smiles.

Go Sammy.

Go Sammy!

be for five minutes.

-Work it.

649
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:22,928
Tone it.

650
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,229
Oh, shake that rear, baby.

651
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,030
Shake that rear.

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,031
Make me hot.

You're so hot.

You're sweaty.

00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,735
Everybody into the pool.

740
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,071
[ice cubes giggling]

741
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:49,808
-Here you go.

742
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,844
-Thank you.

743
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,613
Mmm.

744
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:58,283
JACK FROST: This one
is from all of us.

745
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,584
Ah.

746
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,720
Oh, you vixen.

747
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,589
You-- oh, you can't be
all nicey-nice to me

748
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,492
and expect me to forget
how you just threw me away.

749
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,326
Ah!

750
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,394
But that's so nice.

751
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,996
Oh baby, rub me all
over with your lips.

752
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:11,930
OK, OK, OK.

753
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,131
I forgive you, doll.

754
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,599
Oh, I forgive you.

755
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,834
Ooh.

756
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:16,635
Ow!

757
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,103
Ow, no!

758
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:18,904
No!

759
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:19,871
No!

760
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,839
Stop!

761
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,040
That's it!

762
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,810
You are so fuckin' dead!

763
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,610
-OK.

764
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,145
Mmm.

765
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,213
I'm ready.

766
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,514
-Let's try this.

767
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,383
-Nice scarf.

768
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,552
-Beautiful.

769
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,086
OK, Sarah, big smile.

770
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:46,498
-Oh, I guess it was
decapitated coffee.

771
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,768
Let's take some Polaroids.

772
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,236
We'll need some frost.

773
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,704
Oh, you look so beautiful.

774
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,705
Hold that pose.

775
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,873
Oh, lovely, lovely.

776
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:55,674
Mm-hmm.

777
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,142
Now for your close-up.

778
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,110
Look me in the eyes.

779
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,579
[screaming]

780
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,084
-Wow!

781
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,453
Ooh, Honey.

782
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,522
-Did you hear that?

783
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,891
-What?

784
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,793
The wind in the palm trees?

785
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:15,594
Children laughing?

786
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,062
The arrows flying?

787
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,096
People in the pool?

788
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,931
Cocktail shakers?

789
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,032
What?

790
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,500
What is making you frown
so heavily, darling?

791
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,368
-I don't know.

792
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,202
I just felt something.

793
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,972
It was something cold.

794
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,241
-Sam, you have to go
through whatever it is you

795
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,141
have to go through.

796
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,276
I just--

797
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,577
-He's not still going on
about Frosty Boy, is he?

798
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,378
-Marla--

799
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,312
-Sam, come on.

800
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,480
Enough is enough.

801
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,115
So we had a really crappy
Christmas last year.

802
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,416
Life goes on.

803
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,517
Except for Jack Frost.

804
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,320
And that is really
the point, isn't he?

805
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,121
Wow!

806
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,522
Bull's eye!

807
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,559
-Why do I still have
this feeling of some--

808
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,928
something whispering to me and--

809
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,097
-Maybe it's your time of month.

810
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,298
Who knows?

811
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,834
Sam, we love you, but
you're getting boring.

812
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,168
And annoying.

813
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,336
You know, you've
really got to find

814
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,471
something new to complain about.

815
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,272
Jack is gone.

816
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,441
Trust me on this one.

817
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,542
Bull's eye again!

818
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,176
Whoo!

819
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:05,744
Arrow collection.

820
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,917
-Meet me in Reception
in 10 minutes.

821
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,118
-Who is that?

822
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,154
-Don't turn around.

823
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,122
Someone might be watching.

824
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,290
-Yeah, who?

825
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,292
-Exactly.

826
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,061
Glad to see we're on the same
page on this one, Sheriff.

827
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,529
-What do you want, Manners?

828
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,931
-Not here.

829
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,766
The walls might have ears.

830
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,068
I'll meet you in
Reception in 10 minutes.

831
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,469
-Well, if it's so
important, why don't you

832
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,506
just talk to me
about it right here?

833
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,307
-I have to pee.

834
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,211
-Oh.

835
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,114
[toilet flushing]

836
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,091
-You alone?

837
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,260
-Yeah, I'm alone.

838
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,262
-You're sure no
one followed you?

839
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,165
-Well, I did a little tricky
double-back across the paddle

840
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:03,134
tennis courts just in case
so I could throw them.

841
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,369
Yeah, I'm alone.

842
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,106
Manners, what in the
hell are you doing here?

843
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,876
-Well, after that
thing last Christmas,

844
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,512
I gave myself a
leave of absence.

845
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,981
-Oh, they fired you, huh?

846
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,316
-Canned my ass
right out the door.

847
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:22,620
I guess not too many people
believe in killer snowmen.

848
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,588
-Yeah.

849
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,025
I've been there.

850
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:29,828
Well, so, uh, what's
this all about, huh?

851
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,696
-We got us a case.

852
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,632
This is no "boo-hoo, they
stole my fishing pole" case.

853
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,935
This is a real "tongs
in the eyeball,

854
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,903
chop 'em in little pieces" case.

855
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,539
-Not a shark attack, huh?

856
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,442
-There's someone I'd
like you to meet.

857
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,246
[bell chiming]

858
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,914
Sam, I think you
know our director

859
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:50,749
of island entertainment.

860
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,218
-Oh sure, Captain Fun, yeah.

861
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,019
-Mr. Tiler.

862
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,420
-Captain.

863
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,357
-It may surprise you to
know he's on our side.

864
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,292
That little performance back
in the office, that was just

865
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:05,263
a ruse to allay the
others' suspicions.

866
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,398
-Yeah.

867
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:09,501
Well, I wasn't there,
so I-- I didn't see it.

868
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,902
-Ah.

869
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:15,740
Well, pretty darn good
performance, if you ask me.

870
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,476
-Well, thank you.

871
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,612
You know, I wanted to be an
actor when I first started

872
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,914
in the biz, so you-- well,
you saying that, I mean--

873
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,282
-Look, guys.

874
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,851
Uh, I-- I'm not here as a
law enforcement officer.

875
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,253
I'm just here on vacation.

876
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,021
So what do you want from me?

877
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,256
-I've seen you in
action, Sheriff.

878
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:34,225
I want you on our side.

879
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,362
Captain Fun has a plan.

880
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,632
-Well-- well, what we need to
do is give the killer a false

881
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,703
sense of security, lure
him out into the open

882
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,105
when he thinks no
one is watching.

883
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,140
-OK.

884
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,575
What's the plan?

885
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,310
-Trust me.

886
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,079
You'll love it.

887
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,017
[music playing]

888
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:04,656
-So this is your plan to lure
the killer out into the open?

889
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,558
-Isn't it the tops?

890
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,894
-Isn't this the same thing you
suggested to-- to cheer me up?

891
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,329
-Yep.

892
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,631
-And what if I forgot my
wife's birthday or something?

893
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,432
-Oh, yeah.

894
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,668
This would work great.

895
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,070
-So basically your
solution to every problem

896
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,940
is to throw a party and have
people dress up like idiots,

897
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,174
and then get them roaring drunk.

898
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,976
-You'd be amazed at
how effective it is.

899
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:25,810
Oh!

900
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,245
You gotta try the banana shrimp.

901
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,746
-No, I'll pass.

902
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,014
-It's integral to
the whole plan.

903
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,683
-I-- I'm allergic to bananas.

904
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:32,851
-Oh.

905
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:33,651
Hi.

906
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,158
-Seen anything funny?

907
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:42,660
-Don't even go there.

908
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,765
That's a very subtle costume
you got on there, Manners.

909
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,999
-Back in the Bureau,
we would call

910
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,603
this a reverse double negative.

911
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,738
I'm going to check
out the conga line.

912
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,539
Conga.

913
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,382
-Give me a beer,
will you, Bobby?

914
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,887
JACK FROST: Say, pal,
how about a smoke?

915
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:12,857
Excuse me.

916
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:13,591
Pardon me.

917
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,092
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

918
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:14,592
Excuse me.

919
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,193
Excuse me.

920
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:15,994
Pardon me.

921
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:16,995
Pardon me.

922
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,062
-[inaudible] Sam.

923
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,431
-Sam's got a runner.

924
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,433
-Why are you talking
to your watch?

925
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,434
-Old habit.

926
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,403
Let's go.

927
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,372
-What's with him?

928
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,873
[laughing]

929
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:01,606
-Not this time, Jack.

930
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,370
-Ugh!

931
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,175
-Oh my god!

932
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:40,078
What have you done?

933
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:40,879
-He was running.

934
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,280
I-- I was chasing him.

935
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,850
And he-- well, he dropped his
carrot nose and I-- you know.

936
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,591
-He's unconscious, you idiot.

937
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,870
-Now, we can't have the
guests attacking the staff.

938
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,739
It's just not on.

939
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,073
-I didn't think it was you, sir.

940
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,775
-Well, I'm pleased to hear it.

941
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,176
-We just thought
we were gonna lure

942
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,945
the killer out into the open.

943
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:16,114
-There is no killer.

944
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,416
The two most dangerous
things on this island

945
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,486
are your imagination and
Mr. Tiler's poor judgment.

946
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:22,987
-I'm so sorry, Colonel.

947
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,257
-Now, the supply ship will
be here in the morning.

948
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,825
They'll contact the police.

949
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,260
Panic over.

950
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,397
So I'll be grateful if you two
would stop alarming people, eh?

951
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,197
Right.

952
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,499
Everyone, off to bed.

953
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,467
Look, Bobby, get me an aspirin.

954
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,574
-Your suit still
has a nose on it.

955
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,409
-Yes.

956
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,444
Luckily, you didn't break that.

957
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,445
-But out on the ground--

958
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,246
-Sam.

959
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,180
-No.

960
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,815
There was a carrot
on the ground.

961
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,849
-Sam.

962
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:52,650
No.

963
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,395
-But I heard his voice, Anne.

964
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,797
-Sam.

965
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,731
-No, I did.

966
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,299
Not like it's in my head.

967
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,434
I heard him.

968
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,270
-You heard someone
who sounded like him.

969
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,205
-Anne, I've heard
that voice every night

970
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,742
in my dreams for the past year.

971
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:18,710
I heard--

972
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,611
-No, you didn't.

973
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,881
You couldn't, because
Jack Frost is dead.

974
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:27,118
-He was dead before,
and he came back again.

975
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,553
Maybe something has happened.

976
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,520
-No, it hasn't.

977
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,889
Nothing has happened.

978
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,259
Oh my god.

979
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,363
I just don't know how much
more of this I can take.

980
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:41,199
Jack Frost is dead.

981
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,368
And he's tearing us apart.

982
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,975
Marla is right.

983
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,644
Sam, you are out of control.

984
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,013
You almost killed a man tonight.

985
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,649
This poor, innocent old
man is barely conscious

986
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,185
because you just
can't get over it.

987
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:05,790
-I know.

988
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,528
Oh god, I'm sorry.

989
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,802
-Sam.

990
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:21,205
I love you.

991
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,807
-Boy.

992
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,243
This is a great second
honeymoon, isn't it?

993
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:03,841
-Ooh, wouldn't mind practicing
a little breast stroke myself.

994
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,943
Always test the water first.

995
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,145
Ooh, no, far too warm.

996
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,015
Must do something about that.

997
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:15,419
Let's stir this party up.

998
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,421
That's much better.

999
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,871
[muffled shrieks]

1000
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,248
[muffled shrieking]

1001
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,085
JACK FROST: Hmm?

1002
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,153
What's that, Honey?

1003
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:49,987
Hmm.

1004
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,923
No, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

1005
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:55,927
You'll have to
scream much louder.

1006
00:44:55,927 --> 00:45:00,398
[muffled screaming]

1007
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,599
-Help me!

1008
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,400
Please!

1009
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:18,382
-Ah.

1010
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,419
Now, this is much more my style.

1011
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,353
You know what?

1012
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,522
I feel like a cold one.

1013
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:26,490
Mmm.

1014
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,992
Or 12.

1015
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,961
[laughter]

1016
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:34,298
Tonight's weather report,
20% chance of frostbite

1017
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,968
and a 100% chance of death!

1018
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,881
[light snoring]

1019
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:08,366
-Honey, did you turn on
the air conditioning?

1020
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,867
-Uh-uh.

1021
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:10,868
Go back to sleep.

1022
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,809
There is no air
conditioning, remember?

1023
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:19,810
-Oh, yeah.

1024
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,892
ANNE: Um, dear, could you
get me a glass of water?

1025
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,693
-Sure.

1026
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,925
[wind howling]

1027
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:15,900
-Honey?

1028
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,938
-What, Sweetie?

1029
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,873
-I'm having that dream again.

1030
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,842
ANNE: That's OK, Honey.

1031
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,977
I know you'd never leave
me for Claudia Schiffer.

1032
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,113
-No, no, no, not that one.

1033
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:30,381
The other one.

1034
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,216
Endless winter.

1035
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,586
ANNE: Honey, just think warm
thoughts like hot chocolate

1036
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,521
and marshmallows.

1037
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,890
-Anne, I need for
you to see this.

1038
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,426
-Sam, just come
back to bed, please.

1039
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,894
-I-- I don't think it's a dream.

1040
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:44,995
Ow!

1041
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:45,963
-Oh my god!

1042
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,164
Sam, what happened?

1043
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:47,965
Eek!

1044
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:48,532
-Oh, my!

1045
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,467
I need backup.

1046
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,468
You two, cover me.

1047
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:51,669
I'm going in.

1048
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:52,470
-Eek!

1049
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:56,440
-Snow?

1050
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,429
-What's happening, Sam?

1051
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,399
-I don't know.

1052
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,901
[chuckling]

1053
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,870
-This is great
fun, eh, Mr. Tiler?

1054
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,071
-Colonel.

1055
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,739
Colonel, doesn't it strike
you as just a little odd

1056
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,774
that it's snowing?

1057
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,875
-Oh, no, no.

1058
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,109
Whoa!

1059
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,979
It happened before way back
in-- you know 1800 and.

1060
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:35,813
Half asleep.

1061
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,114
Yes.

1062
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,683
Yes, a freak storm covered
the entire island in white.

1063
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,052
Of course, that was--
that was hail, not snow.

1064
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,420
Same difference, what?

1065
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,221
Oh, hey.

1066
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:44,922
Hey, now.

1067
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,556
Now, hold on.

1068
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:46,323
No.

1069
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:46,991
Fellow's got to be ready.

1070
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,695
[laughter]

1071
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:52,797
-What do you think, Sam?

1072
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:54,431
-I don't like it.

1073
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,533
-It can't be Jack.

1074
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,801
-Oh, don't ask Sam.

1075
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,203
If the freezer's too cold,
he thinks it's Jack Frost.

1076
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,071
-Marla, why don't
you come off it?

1077
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,174
It was 100 degrees yesterday.

1078
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,109
Temperature doesn't
just drop 70 degrees.

1079
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,279
-Oh, actually Sam, on
Christmas Eve in 1924,

1080
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,514
in Fairfield, Montana,
the temperature

1081
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,918
dropped 84 degrees
in just 12 hours.

1082
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,719
-Where do you get this stuff?

1083
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,488
-Discovery Channel.

1084
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,290
-I just love that about you.

1085
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,358
-That was Montana, Joe.

1086
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:22,393
This is the tropics.

1087
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:25,329
It doesn't happen
down here, does it?

1088
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,430
-No.

1089
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,467
-There's only one person
that could do this.

1090
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,904
-Captain Fun gives
this a big thumbs-up

1091
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,039
on his Christmas fun scale.

1092
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:35,840
-Hey.

1093
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,009
-Come on.

1094
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,411
We're going to build a sled run.

1095
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,813
And we're going to use
surfboards as sleds.

1096
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,315
Isn't that just the craziest?

1097
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,488
-He's here.

1098
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,489
-Oh, Sam.
-He's here.

1099
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,858
I know he's here.

1100
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:54,859
I know it.

1101
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,402
-That sled sounds like fun.

1102
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,203
-Yeah.

1103
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,485
-Oh dude, my beer's warm.

1104
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,287
-Bummer.

1105
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,656
Hey, look.

1106
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,925
Frozen pole.

1107
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:28,726
-Yeah.

1108
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,764
What, so?

1109
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,665
-Warm beer.

1110
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:35,699
Frozen pole.

1111
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:40,404
-I don't get it.

1112
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,438
-Luke, dude.

1113
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,441
You gotta put your
tongue to the pole.

1114
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,577
-What, dude, do you
think I'm stupid?

1115
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,445
My tongue will stick.

1116
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,015
-I'll pour the warm
beer down the pole,

1117
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:54,051
and it'll get cold again.

1118
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,020
-Yeah.

1119
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,820
That's cool.

1120
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,396
Yeah, look.

1121
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,864
Hey, man.

1122
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,066
Fuck, this hurts.

1123
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,935
[guffawing]

1124
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:13,304
-Oh, bummer.

1125
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:14,238
-Look.

1126
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,472
-Hey, look.

1127
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,307
Chicks.

1128
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:17,107
-Huh?

1129
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,742
Hey!

1130
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,710
Wait.

1131
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,813
Don't leave me.

1132
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:23,614
Ugh.

1133
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,986
Anybody out there?

1134
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:31,455
Help!

1135
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,325
JACK FROST: Yeah,
dude, what's up?

1136
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:36,593
-My tongue's stuck, man.

1137
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,861
JACK FROST: Oh, bummer.

1138
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,797
Let me help you.

1139
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:42,833
-Oh, thanks, dude.

1140
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,203
-Now, this might
sting a bit, bro.

1141
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,204
-Go for it, man.

1142
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,672
-Cowatunga, dude.

1143
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,643
-Hey.

1144
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,745
Hey, look at all the
snowballs I made.

1145
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:55,546
Oh.

1146
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,046
Oh.

1147
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,014
OK.

1148
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:57,982
Oh, wait.

1149
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:00,451
Aw.

1150
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,418
I'll make more.

1151
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:14,098
JACK FROST: This
one's for you, Sam.

1152
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,600
-He sees me.

1153
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,102
I can feel it.

1154
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:27,578
-Get him.

1155
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,581
Right there.

1156
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:34,551
[shrieking]

1157
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,061
-Help!

1158
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,066
-Oh, no.

1159
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,201
-Sam.

1160
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,069
Oh my god!

1161
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,876
[screaming]

1162
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:02,312
-It's another holly
jolly Christmas.

1163
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,280
[shrieking]

1164
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,248
-Come inside!

1165
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,553
-What the hell is going on?

1166
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,721
Ow!

1167
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:11,522
MAN: Oh my god!

1168
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,990
Get out of my bed.

1169
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,659
What the hell hap-- what
the hell's going on?

1170
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:16,427
What?

1171
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:16,827
Hey.

1172
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:17,227
Hey.

1173
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:17,761
Ow.

1174
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:18,896
God damn it.

1175
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:19,830
What the-- cut it out!

1176
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,631
Hey.

1177
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:21,198
Hey.

1178
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:21,865
Hey, cut it out.

1179
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,366
No.

1180
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,167
Ow!

1181
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,272
[distant shrieking]

1182
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:31,608
-They're playing my song.

1183
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,544
[screaming]

1184
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,511
-Can you see anything?

1185
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,479
-I'm looking.

1186
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,214
-What is wrong with everyone?

1187
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,850
Jack Frost is not here.

1188
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:40,651
-Oh, yeah?

1189
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:43,454
Then what the hell is that?

1190
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,222
-(LAUGHING) Oh, for
Christ's sake, Sam.

1191
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,957
That is not Jack Frost.

1192
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,692
They just built that.

1193
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:49,660
-Sam, no!

1194
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,595
-Hey, Jack.

1195
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,797
You remember me?

1196
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,365
I sure as hell remember you.

1197
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,767
-Sam, don't.

1198
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,302
-See, these folks around here,
they don't know you like I do,

1199
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,303
Jack.

1200
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,138
They think you're
cute and innocent,

1201
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:04,842
like butter would
melt in your mouth.

1202
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,310
See this, Jack?

1203
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,778
Know what this is?

1204
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,380
This is concentrated
antifreeze, and I've

1205
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,549
been wearing it around
my neck for a year,

1206
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,152
just waiting for you to
show your ugly face again.

1207
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:18,989
Now it's time for you
to die again, Jack.

1208
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,324
How about it?

1209
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,291
Are you ready to scream?

1210
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:29,299
-Ay.

1211
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,845
-Oh, shit.

1212
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,814
[ice crackling]

1213
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,726
-Miss me?

1214
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,427
Hmm?

1215
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:59,163
-Jack?

1216
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:01,064
-Aw, you remember.

1217
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,799
How sweet of you.

1218
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,002
[chuckling]

1219
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,937
Huh?

1220
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:07,971
Oh, gotta go.

1221
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,772
Whee!

1222
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,044
-Manners, where'd he go?

1223
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,045
-He melted.

1224
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:15,913
-He was right here.

1225
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,714
-He melted in the snow.

1226
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,515
-Get inside.

1227
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:19,349
MARLA: Hold on a minute.

1228
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,986
Don't tell me that is Manners.

1229
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,355
-Agent Manners from last year?

1230
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,323
-He got a lot cuter.

1231
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,025
-What the hell is he doing here?

1232
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:29,726
-It doesn't matter.

1233
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,595
Did you see what
direction he went in?

1234
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:33,964
-Straight down.

1235
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:34,965
-See?

1236
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:35,899
I told you it was Jack.

1237
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,567
I told.

1238
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:37,301
I felt it all along.

1239
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:38,135
-It can't be Jack.

1240
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,369
How the hell did he get here?

1241
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,370
Did he fly first class?

1242
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,338
-Marla, we don't know.

1243
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,673
But you saw him
with your own eyes.

1244
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,841
-Hey, if Agent Manners is here--

1245
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,943
-I had nothing to do with it.

1246
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,511
Now, let's get inside.

1247
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:54,351
[panting]

1248
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,285
-How did you know?

1249
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,286
-I don't know.

1250
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,688
My guess is that
we're linked somehow,

1251
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,823
as if I'm a part of him,
or he's a part of me.

1252
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,092
-I want to know what a
government agent is doing here.

1253
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,595
-I'm not a government
agent anymore.

1254
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:05,796
I've retired to this island.

1255
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:06,930
-Oh, come off it.

1256
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:07,931
-It's true, Marla.

1257
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,166
He's been here for months.

1258
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,068
But Jack's here not because
of him-- because of me.

1259
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,135
-Oh, come on, Sam.

1260
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,771
We don't even know
if it is Jack Frost.

1261
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,440
-No, Marla, it's probably
some other walking,

1262
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,375
talking snowman that
everybody's talking about.

1263
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,643
-What the hell is going on here?

1264
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,411
You brought caulking
on our vacation?

1265
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,214
-Well, that could come
in handy at any time.

1266
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,349
-Whoa.

1267
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,251
Looks like somebody got
a little obsessed here.

1268
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,955
[grunting]

1269
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,156
-Guys!

1270
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,826
Guys, we can't just
barricade ourselves in here.

1271
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,160
-Oh, I don't know, Anne.

1272
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,762
This could be the first sane
thought Sam's had in a year.

1273
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:39,863
-Seal ourselves
in for the night?

1274
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,431
Sounds good to me.

1275
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,532
-No.

1276
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,068
We have to find the
others and warn them.

1277
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:53,610
-We could draw straws.

1278
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,313
-No.

1279
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:57,814
I'll go.

1280
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,751
The island's my responsibility.

1281
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,052
-I'll go with you.

1282
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:02,853
-And I'll--

1283
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:03,654
-No.

1284
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:06,490
Joe, you stay here.

1285
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,759
-That's what I was going to say.

1286
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,559
-Oh.

1287
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,000
Well, it looks like it's
you and me, Manners.

1288
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,004
-That's Agent Manners.

1289
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,005
-Yeah.

1290
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,674
OK, whatever you're
comfortable with.

1291
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:30,847
-Clear.

1292
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:36,053
-Honey?

1293
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,487
-Yeah.

1294
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,424
-I love you.

1295
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:41,425
-Don't worry.

1296
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,225
I'll be safe.

1297
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,129
-Sam.

1298
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,065
-Yeah.

1299
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,733
-Good luck.

1300
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:50,534
-Yeah.

1301
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,438
-Sam.

1302
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,672
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know, good luck.

1303
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,473
Thank you.

1304
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,574
-No.

1305
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,775
You didn't pack any
food in your supplies,

1306
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,077
so if you find yourself
in the kitchen,

1307
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,545
I thought you might
pick us up some--

1308
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,651
-You never thought we'd find
ourselves in this situation

1309
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:08,652
again, I'm sure.

1310
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:09,986
-Well, it's not like before.

1311
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,122
Before, Jack couldn't
just freeze things.

1312
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:14,191
How the heck did
he find me anyway?

1313
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,660
I'm 1,000 miles from home.

1314
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,763
-2,340.

1315
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:22,966
I checked my air miles.

1316
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,601
Who'd you tell that you
were coming here anyway?

1317
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,402
-Oh, come on.

1318
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:26,470
That's ridiculous.

1319
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,105
If Jack had asked
anyone for directions,

1320
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,807
they would have contacted me.

1321
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,275
-If they survived it.

1322
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,691
[sigh]

1323
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,663
-(WHISPERING) I don't get it.

1324
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,466
How did Sam know Jack was here?

1325
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,969
You know, this whole time I
just thought he was losing it.

1326
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,705
-He thinks they're
linked somehow.

1327
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,039
-Oh, please.

1328
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,275
-No, hold on.

1329
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,578
Remember, the night Jack was
melted, Sam was wounded, right?

1330
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,413
-Yeah.

1331
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:12,816
-Bleeding into the antifreeze.

1332
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:17,521
Well, maybe somehow their
DNA got mixed up together.

1333
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,260
-No more Sci-Fi
Channel for you, Honey.

1334
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,061
-Marla, think about it.

1335
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,397
How else did Jack find us out
here in the middle of nowhere?

1336
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:42,913
-What do you think
happened to Jack?

1337
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:43,713
-I don't know.

1338
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:44,948
I thought you buried him.

1339
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,149
-Yeah, we did bury him.

1340
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,251
We had sealed containers,
unmarked graves,

1341
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,453
the whole nine yards.

1342
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:50,520
-Ooh.

1343
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,357
I hate it when the
dead don't stay dead.

1344
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,326
[door creaking]

1345
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,262
[metal rattling]

1346
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,699
[shouting]

1347
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,168
[shouting]

1348
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:13,443
-Cease fire.

1349
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,244
Cease fire.

1350
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,846
-Oh, what'd you do that for?

1351
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,280
-Mr. Tiler.

1352
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,584
That puts us just about
even, wouldn't you say, eh?

1353
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,786
-What was that thing?

1354
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,954
-All right.

1355
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,188
Listen up.

1356
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,357
I'll tell you exactly
what you're dealing with.

1357
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:31,228
Jack Frost is a cold-blooded
killing machine.

1358
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:34,798
Now, he's-- he's also
made of genetically

1359
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,399
altered water molecules.

1360
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,239
I'm sorry, that's--
that's usually the place

1361
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:45,775
where people start
laughing at me.

1362
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,576
OK.

1363
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,978
OK.

1364
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,647
Well now, Jack, he can freeze
and unfreeze himself at will.

1365
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,148
He can turn himself
into water and come

1366
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,650
right underneath the door.

1367
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,318
So what we've got to
do is find anything

1368
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,354
we can to seal up the cracks.

1369
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,956
We gotta make it as
airtight as possible.

1370
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,391
-Well, what about your wife?

1371
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,192
-They're OK.

1372
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,293
They're OK.

1373
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,461
They're holed up in
the room with a couple

1374
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:05,695
off gallons of antifreeze.

1375
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,763
-Antifreeze?

1376
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,999
-It's the only thing
that will stop him.

1377
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,334
We need to collect as
much of it as possible.

1378
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,904
-Antifreeze.

1379
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:17,073
OK, antifreeze.

1380
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,743
This is a tropical
island, for god's sake!

1381
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,444
-Wait a minute.

1382
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,846
Is antifreeze the
same thing as coolant?

1383
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,147
-Uh-huh.

1384
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,583
-Well, we got drums of the
stuff in a old storage shed.

1385
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:31,054
Our generator drink it up
like a rum punch, you know.

1386
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,155
-Let's do it.

1387
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,896
[chuckling]

1388
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,064
-You hear that?

1389
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:41,865
-What's up?

1390
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,967
-The fat lady's warming up.

1391
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:44,868
[chuckling]

1392
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,173
-Wait.

1393
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:50,974
Snow angel!

1394
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,001
-This is ingenious, Sheriff.

1395
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,936
You know, back in
India we once caught

1396
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:23,106
a 600-pound Bengal
tiger the same way.

1397
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:26,376
Mind you, we had to
dig a 12-foot-deep pit

1398
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:28,745
and use the CO's
pet dog as bait.

1399
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,525
-No, no, no, no.

1400
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,630
Don't come telling me, Bobby,
somebody's got to be the bait.

1401
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,430
No.

1402
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,231
-Don't worry, Bobby.

1403
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,500
I'll do it.

1404
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,670
It's me he's after.

1405
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,272
It's me he'll come for.

1406
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,440
-Don't worry.

1407
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,943
I got your back.

1408
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:00,744
-Thanks.

1409
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:22,932
-I say, if this creature's
only after Mr. Tiler,

1410
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,668
why don't we just
let it have him

1411
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:26,936
and get the whole
thing over with?

1412
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:32,509
Just a thought.

1413
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:36,312
-How you doing, Sheriff?

1414
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,418
-So far it's a piece of cake.

1415
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:50,126
[water dripping]

1416
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,616
-Hey, how's it going, Sam?

1417
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,786
[gasping]

1418
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,421
-Hi, Jack.

1419
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,391
-So what are we doing?

1420
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:22,459
-Waiting.

1421
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,961
-Waiting for what?

1422
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:28,331
-Waiting for you to blow it.

1423
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,499
-Ooh.

1424
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:30,834
-Oh, shoot.

1425
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:34,871
-Here I come, ready
or-- oh, oh, oh, whoa!

1426
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,873
-Psych!

1427
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:44,781
[shouting]

1428
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:49,219
-Yeah.

1429
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:56,126
[happy shouting]

1430
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,094
-Well-- well done, sir.

1431
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,763
Excellent, sir.

1432
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:00,563
Brilliant.

1433
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:04,868
-Yeah!

1434
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:05,802
-I'm getting way too
good at this, you know.

1435
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:07,036
I'm getting way
too much practice.

1436
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,639
[laughter]

1437
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,041
-Anyone want to get into it and
[inaudible] snowman already?

1438
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,077
-You bastards!

1439
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:17,113
Have you any idea how
much this shit stings?

1440
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,214
And I swallowed it!

1441
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,416
I'll be hacking
it up for a week!

1442
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,251
-Shoot.

1443
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,051
-Fire.

1444
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:22,852
Fire.

1445
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,187
-Shoot!

1446
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:25,288
-Oh, please.

1447
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,389
This again?

1448
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,390
Come off it.

1449
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,692
Ha!

1450
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:30,693
-It isn't working.

1451
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,295
Why isn't it working?

1452
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,864
-Because I'm all-new
and improved.

1453
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,432
-Get back, everyone!

1454
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,934
-What's the matter, Sammy?

1455
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,869
You all out of ideas?

1456
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:40,703
-That should kill you.

1457
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,472
The antifreeze should kill you.

1458
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,408
-Well, let me explain to
you the inherent dangers

1459
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:47,443
of unregulated genetic
experimentation.

1460
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,145
You see-- [burp] oh.

1461
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,246

01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,901
-Hand sandwich.

[baby snowball chittering]

1645
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,886
-We filled the back of the
truck up with antifreeze, see.

1646
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,755
And then the
antifreeze was there,

1647
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,923
and-- and then it
was sort of green.

1648
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,292
And when I jumped
into the antifreeze,

1649
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,394
this Jack Frost, he just--

1650
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:32,161
-Sam.

1651
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,095
---turned into antifreeze.

1652
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:33,863
So what we need is
some antifreeze.

1653
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:34,930
-Sam.

1654
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,132
-If we could just
find some antifreeze--

1655
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:38,367
-Sam!

1656
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,804
One more word, and I'm
gonna kill you myself.

-Yeah.

1676
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,607
-You don't scare me, my
chilly little friend.

1677
01:17:58,607 --> 01:17:59,408
No.

1678
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,653
Back in India, I was once
caught by the Punjabi.

1679
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,389
Those bloody planes [inaudible].

1680
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:14,557
Softly.

1681
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,892
Softly, Colonel.

1682
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:18,627
Cunning of a fox.

Yes.

-I won't.

1697
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:32,768
I--

1698
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,004
-Everybody's dead!

1699
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:36,538
It was snowing, and
everything was really fun.

1700
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,339
Then--

1701
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:38,140
-Hey!

1702
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,541
Sweetcake, snap out of it.

1703
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,143
Now, what is your name?

1704
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,845
-Well-- well, my
real name is Amanda.

1705
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:44,280
My friends, they
like to call me Ma--

-Amanda.
-Uh-huh?

1707
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,849
-I am going to get
you out of here.

1708
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:49,218
Now we are heading
down to the kitchen.

1709
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:50,219
-What was that?

1710
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,220
-Hold on.

-Yes, baby.

1716
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:09,938
You can do it.

1717
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:10,939
You can try it.

1718
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:11,907
Yes, baby.

1719
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,376
You can-- Idiot.

1720
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,844
You're going to die off.

01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,080

-Baby?

1726
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:34,663
-What is this?

1727
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,464
-Hey.

1728
01:20:35,464 --> 01:20:36,298
-Come on.

1729
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:36,865
It-- it's some kind of cocktail.

1730
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:37,666
What's in it?

1731
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:38,600
-Oh, Honey.

1732
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,702
-Not now.

1733
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:41,203
-Anne, I really don't
think it's the time

1734
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,604
to be swapping recipes.

1735
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,672
-It kills them.

1736
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,274
It kills the baby
snowballs, all right?

1737
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:46,475
Now, what the hell is in it?

1738
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,914
-Oh, that's Bobby's
Island Daiquiri.

1739
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:54,516
It got light run, just
a dash of maraschino,

1740
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,251
lemon juice, half a
teaspoon of sugar,

1741
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,154
and half a banana,
blended to perfection.

1742
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,222
-Well, it must be the alcohol.

1743
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:01,657
That's like antifreeze, right?

1744
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:02,891
-I wouldn't like that.

1745
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,393
I'll have a mint julep, Bobby.

1746
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,495
-Not now, Sam, please.

1747
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:07,362
-I don't like bananas.

1748
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,564
-Honey, not now!

1749
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:15,304
Bananas.

1750
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:19,341
Oh my god, Sam's
allergic to bananas.

1751
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:20,909
You remember a year
ago, when Sam's

1752
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,511
blood got into the antifreeze?

1753
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:23,712
Well, that's when
they linked up.

1754
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,581
Well, maybe when
that happened, Jack

1755
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:29,618
inherited Sam's banana allergy.

1756
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:32,488
[laughing]

1757
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:47,436
-Go.

01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:47,936
Go.
-Contact.

01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:48,904
-Oh.

1760
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,840
Ooh!

1761
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,775
-Oh.

1762
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:54,109
Banana daiquiri, anyone?

1763
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:14,196
-You know, these Organica
cookies are pretty darn good.

1764
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:19,802
-Let's get it on.

1765
01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:26,308
-Huh?

1766
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,277
Uh-oh.

1767
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:31,780
Oh no!

JACK FROST: There, there.

1775
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,152
Come here.

1776
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,655
It's OK.

1777
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:47,589
It's OK.

1778
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,729
Ah, little one.

1779
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:54,530
Aw.

1780
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:58,667
Easy.

1781
01:23:58,667 --> 01:23:59,468
Easy.

1782
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:04,907
There, there, little one.

01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,840
-Now it's killing time.

1785

-So who won the war then, eh?

[chuckling]

1787
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:57,392
-So what do we do
with it this time?

1788
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,494
Bury it twice as deep
as we did last time?

1789
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,068
-We'll come in first
thing in the morning

1790
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:07,703
and hose the whole place down.

1791
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:08,837
No one will be any the wiser.

1792
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:10,172
Oh, yes.

1793
01:25:10,172 --> 01:25:12,074
Be open for business in a week.

1794
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:13,842
-Colonel?

1795
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,178
You got 18 bodies
to explain, man.

1796
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:17,412
-Food poisoning.

1797
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:18,680
Ah.

1798
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,882
No, no, that wouldn't look
too good either, would it?

1799
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,684
We'll just say
the plane arrived.

1800
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,020
Nobody on board.

1801
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,422
Yah!

-Ugh.

01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:49,011
Ugh.

1806
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,179
Wow.

1807
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,749
Honey, it's after midnight.

1808
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:57,853
Today is our wedding day.

1809
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,966
-For better or for
worse, I promise

1810
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:14,936
to love and to protect you.

1811
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:15,904
-I do too.

1812
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:28,483

totally fuckin' dead.

Jack!

into town, and I'm

1819
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:42,297
looking for the bitch
who killed my family.

1820
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,169
oh, no way out.

1821
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:04,019
-Joe, help me!

1822
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:05,520
Anybody?

1823
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,989
Somebody help me!

[screaming]

1825
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:11,460
Anyone?

1826
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,929
[screaming]

1827
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:22,871
[anguished howling]

1828
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:24,840
[whimpering]

1829
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,812
Oh my god.

1830
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:34,282
Oh, you son of a bitch!

1831
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:37,252
You should have heard
your babies scream, Jack.

1832
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,721
You should have
heard them scream.

1833
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,723
Sam?

1834
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:42,691
Sam!

1835
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:44,693
-Oh, Honey.

1836
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:47,462
You are missing the point.

1837
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:48,497
Get it?

1838
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:49,297
Get it?

1839
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,198
SAM: Hey, Jack.

1840
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:50,999
-Huh?

1841
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,201
-Get this.

1842
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:54,002
-Oi.

1843
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,206
Oh, crap.

1844
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:09,584
-Anne!

1845
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:12,554
Anne!

1846
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:13,455
Anne!

1847
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,256
Anne.

1848
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:15,323
Annie.

1849
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,124
Anne!

1850
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:21,596
Come on.
Come on.

1851
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:22,898
Anne!

1852
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:24,132
Annie, come on.

1853
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:24,933
Anne!

1854
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:31,373
Ah!

1855
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:36,144
Anne.

1856
01:28:42,284 --> 01:28:45,253
[coughing]

1857
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:47,222
[relieved laughter]

1858
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:53,161
-Oh fuck, I hate Christmas.

1859
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:02,771
So Sam, where do you
want to go next year?

1860
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:04,573
-Oh Honey, do we really
have to go anywhere.

1861
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:07,342
-Oh Honey, it's great to
travel at the holidays.

1862
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,711
-Sure, but something
always goes wrong.

1863
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:11,513
-Oh, how about Greece?

1864
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,447
-Greece?

1865
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,182
No, not another island.

1866
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,183
ANNE: Oh, Sam.

1867
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:23,491
[foghorn blasting]

1868
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,827
-Good grief, what has happened?

1869
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,363
-It appears the island
has been covered in snow.

1870
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,164
-Yes.

1871
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:30,832
But that is impossible.

1872
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:34,135
-And yet, here it
is before our eyes.

1873
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:37,539
[massive splash]

1874
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,506
-Did you feel that?

1875
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:39,474
-Yes, I did.

1876
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,776
But what was it?

1877
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:44,446
-I do not know.

1878
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:49,317
But it is coming from
behind the island.

1879
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:52,754
[loud roaring sound]

1880
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,389
-Whoa!

1881
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,190
[inaudible]

1882
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,563
[music - "merry christmas baby"]

1883
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,860
MARLA: Hello?

1884
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,229
Anne?

1885
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:16,097
Sam?

1886
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:19,067
We're in here!

1887
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:22,637
Joe's turning blue!

1888
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:25,073
Open the door!
