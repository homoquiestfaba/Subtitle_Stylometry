-WE'RE DOING A FEATURE

181
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,916
ON THE RECENT SUNSPOT ACTIVITY.

182
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,000
UH, DR. SHEPARD PROMISED
AN INTERVIEW AT 2:00,

183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,166
AND IT'S NOW ALMOST
A QUARTER TO 3:00.

184
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,916
-WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN

185
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,625
TO HELP YOU FIND HIM.

186
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,375
EXCUSE ME.

187
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,708
-LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE MISPLACED

188
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,500
A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER.

189
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,041
-UM, SO WHAT DO I TELL

190
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,791
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN
DOWNSTAIRS?

191
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,125
-JUST TELL THEM TO COOL
THEIR HEELS FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

192
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,208
MAYBE THEY'LL GET BORED,
GO HOME.

193
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,541
-OK.

194
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,500
-CHRISTOPHER...

195
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,166
GINNY SENT THE CALCULATIONS

196
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,666
OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
DISTURBANCES

197
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,833
ASSOCIATED WITH ASTEROID 460.

198
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,458
YOUR WORK IS FLAWLESS.

199
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,666
I WISH IT...WASN'T.

200
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,875
WE'VE ALL SPENT
SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES

201
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,875
PONDERING THE MYSTERIES
OF THE COSMOS,

202
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,708
BUT NONE OF US COULD SAY
WHAT WE WOULD DO

203
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,375
IF WE ONLY HAD ONE WEEK
LEFT TO LIVE.

204
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,875
BON VOYAGE.

205
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,625
-CHRIS, I NEED TO SEE YOU.

206
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,375
MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW.

207
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,458
-GOOD NEWS, CHRIS.

208
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,625
I'M ASSIGNING YOU TO
THE SOLAR PHYSICS CONFERENCE.

209
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,375
YOU'LL BE REPRESENTING US

210
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,708
AS LEAD SCIENTIST
ON THE SOLAR PROBE.

211
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,375
-UH, AUSTIN SHEPARD
IS LEAD SCIENTIST

212
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,708
ON THE SOLAR PROBE.

213
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,708
-DR. SHEPARD HAS DISAPPEARED.

214
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,125
-AND YOU ARE?

215
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,666
-SPECIAL AGENT DELGADO,

216
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,875
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
ORGANIZATION.

217
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,750
-LONG WAY FROM HOME.

218
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,500
-MY ASSOCIATES--
AGENT BOTT, AGENT MEANS.

219
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,958
-INTERNAL SECURITY BUREAU.

220
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,250
WE'RE COOPERATING
ON DR. SHEPARD'S CASE.

221
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,500
-WHAT CASE IS THAT?

222
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,416
-AUSTIN TOOK
AN UNSCHEDULED TRIP

223
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,083
OUT OF THE COUNTRY
THIS MORNING, CHRIS.

224
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,750
-ANY IDEA WHERE HE WENT?

225
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,291
-LOOKING FOR A GOOD CURRY?

226
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,958
HEH.

227
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,125
-UH...

228
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,958
LET'S SEE. UM...

229
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,791
HERE. THE EQUATOR.

230
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,791
-ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.

231
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,291
THEY THINK THAT AUSTIN
HAS BEEN SELLING

232
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,625
SOME OF THE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS

233
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,625
FOR SOLAR PROBE...

234
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,666
TO OTHER PARTIES.

235
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,958
-UH...AUSTIN?

236
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,166
-BEFORE DR. SHEPARD
LEFT THIS MORNING,

237
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,166
HE EMAILED 5 COLLEAGUES--

238
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,000
ALL ASTROPHYSICISTS,

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,666
NONE OF WHOM
HAS ANYTHING TO DO

240
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,166
WITH THE SOLAR PROBE PROJECT,

241
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,666
AND ALL OF WHOM
ARE SCHEDULED TO BE

242
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,666
AT THE SOLAR CONFERENCE
TOMORROW.

243
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,166
-HE EMAILED ME THIS MORNING.

244
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,625
-SAYING?

245
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,333
-NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

246
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,166
BUT HE WAS THANKING ME
FOR SOME INFORMATION

247
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,000
I COMPILED FOR HIM
REGARDING A PLANETESIMAL

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,250
HE WAS INTERESTED IN--

249
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,666
ASTEROID 460--

250
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE SOLAR PROBE.

251
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,125
-DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT
THE OTHER EMAILS WERE ABOUT?

252
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,833
-I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE THE SPOOKS.
YOU TELL ME.

253
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,416
-DR. SHEPARD'S MESSAGES
SELF-DESTRUCTED
AFTER BEING READ.

254
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,083
NO FOOTPRINT;
VERY SOPHISTICATED.

255
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,583
WE KNOW WHO THEY WERE SENT TO,
BUT NOT THEIR CONTENTS.

256
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,208
NOW, WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

257
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,833
-I HAVE NO IDEA.

258
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,041
-CHRIS, THEY NEED TO KNOW
WHAT WAS IN THOSE EMAILS.

259
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,041
-WELL, THEN THEY CAN ASK

260
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,291
WHOEVER RECEIVED THEM.

261
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,708
OH, I GET IT.

262
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,625
SO THIS IS WHY

263
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,625
I'M GOING
TO THE CONFERENCE?

264
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,458
-YOU'LL BE WIRED
WITH A SURVEILLANCE DEVICE.

265
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,916
NO ONE WILL KNOW.

266
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,583
-I WILL KNOW.

267
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,208
-DR. RICHARDSON,

268
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,958
IF DR. SHEPARD IS INNOCENT--

269
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,041
IF HE'S MERELY
OUT FOR A JOYRIDE

270
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,416
LOOKING FOR A GOOD CURRY--

271
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,708
FINE. NO HARM; NO FOUL.

272
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,875
BUT IF HE'S SHOPPING
SOLAR PROBE PROTOCOLS

273
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,208
TO PARTIES OUTSIDE
OF OUR CONSORTIUM,

274
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,916
THEN THAT IS A MATTER
OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

275
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,041
-INTERNATIONAL SECURITY.

276
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,250
-LOOK AT THIS.

277
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,250
-THE SCIENTISTS
IN THAT CONFERENCE,

278
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,666
THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH

279
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,291
THAT COULD BENEFIT
ALL OF MANKIND.

280
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,541
I CAN'T WALK IN THERE
LIKE SOME SPY.

281
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,625
-THERE ISN'T A CHOICE
IN THIS, CHRIS.

282
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,333
YOU'RE LEAVING.

283
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,833
TONIGHT.

284
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,833
-COME WITH ME.

285
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,958
-TROUBLE IN EMERALD CITY.

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,291
-YOU SURE THIS THING CAN FLY?

287
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,208
-WE GO WITH GOD.

288
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,375
-I ONCE READ THE PENTAGON
STUCK A WHOLE SPY MODULE

289
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,875
IN THE HUBBLE WITHOUT
NASA EVER KNOWING.

290
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,708
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT
AT THE TIME.

291
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,041
-WHY WOULD THE N.I.O.
BE INTERESTED IN AUSTIN'S WORK?

292
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,208
UNLESS SOLAR PROBE
HAS SOME FUNCTION

293
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,000
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ABOUT.

294
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,416
-BUT YOU'RE
THE PROJECT MANAGER.

295
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,041
YOU'D KNOW IF THERE WERE
ANY OTHER FUNCTIONS,

296
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,333
WOULDN'T YOU?

297
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,291
-WHATEVER AUSTIN
WAS WORKING ON,

298
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,375
ITS TWIN WOULD BE DOWN HERE.

299
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,416
-INTERNAL SYSTEMS OPS
CREATES A SHADOW FILE

300
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,333
OF EVERYTHING ENTERED
INTO THE SPL NETWORK.

301
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,166
-EVERYTHING?

302
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,250
-THIS IS ODD.
-WHAT?

303
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,166
I'M SCROLLING
ALL COMMUNICATION

304
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,458
BETWEEN DR. SHEPARD
AND ANY SCIENTIST,

305
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,291
EITHER ON OUR NETWORK
OR OUTSIDE OF IT...

306
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,791
-AND?

307
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958
-I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UP UNTIL FIVE DAYS AGO.

308
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,666
AFTER THAT, THERE'S NOTHING.

309
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,208
-YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING
EVEN WEIRDER THAN THAT?

310
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,708
-WHAT?
-IT'S ALL GONE.

311
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,083
ALL OF IT.

312
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,166
ALL OF HIS NOTES,

313
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,625
EVERYTHING ABOUT
THE SOLAR PROBE,

314
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,291
ALL THE DATA I SENT HIM
REGARDING THE PLANETESIMAL.

315
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,541
EVERYTHING FROM
THE LAST FEW DAYS IS GONE.

316
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,458
-WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

317
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,541
-AUSTIN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

318
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,333
-NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE ALL THE TIME.

319
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,375
-YES.

320
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,625
-IT'S STARTED.

321
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,416
Woman on TV: AUTHORITIES
HAVE NO EXPLANATION

322
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,166
FOR THIS TRAGIC
ANIMAL BEHAVIOR,

323
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,375
BUT SCIENTISTS
AT THE INTERNATIONAL
WILDLIFE FEDERATION

324
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,833
CONTINUE TO INSIST

325
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,541
THAT THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP

326
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,208
BETWEEN THE INSTANCE HERE

327
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,208
AND THE SPONTANEOUS
ZEBRA STAMPEDE

328
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,708
WHICH KILLED 30 CHILDREN

329
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,125
IN A REMOTE KENYAN VILLAGE,

330
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,875
OR THE MASSIVE
LOCUST STORMS...

331
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,875
-PLEASE!

332
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,791
-HELP ME.

333
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,416
HELP ME.

334
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,666
-WHOA, I'M SORRY.

335
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,500
-NO, I'M SORRY.

336
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,916
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

337
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,833
-THERE'S A PROBLEM
AT THE LAB.

338
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,541
AUSTIN SHEPARD IS MISSING.

339
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,958
-MISSING?

340
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,375
-HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE SOLAR SYMPOSIUM,

341
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,041
AND NO ONE CAN FIND HIM,

342
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,083
SO I HAVE TO GO
IN HIS PLACE.

343
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,833
-WHEN?

344
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,541
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
HALEY'S RECITAL, AREN'T YOU?

345
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,708
-NO, NO. BROOKE, HONEY...

346
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,625
YOU CANNOT LIVE LIKE THIS, OK?

347
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,125
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE YOURSELF SICK.

348
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,375
-YOU DIDN'T SEE THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE, CHRISTOPHER.

349
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,375
HE ENJOYED WHAT HE DID
TO THOSE PEOPLE.

350
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,583
HE WAS EXCITED BY IT.

351
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,583
-YEAH, AND THANKS TO YOU,

352
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,750
HE IS NEVER GONNA HAVE
THE CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN.

353
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,916
-HE SAID HE WOULD
COME FOR US--FOR HALEY.

354
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,583
-[SIGHS]

355
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,166
HOW?

00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,666
WERE NOT AIMED
DIRECTLY AT EARTH.

531
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,916
Man: AUSTIN WOULDN'T
SEND OUT SUCH AN EMAIL

532
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:16,625
IF HE WASN'T SURE.

533
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,708
Second Man: IT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

534
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,250
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

535
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,125
First Man: WELL, YOU'VE SEEN
THE EQUATIONS.

536
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,708
NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

537
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,208
-LOOK...

538
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,208
JUST BECAUSE WE ARE
UNABLE TO FIND ERROR

539
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,708
IN HIS CALCULATIONS

540
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,375
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN

541
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,125
HIS CONCLUSION IS CORRECT.

542
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,041
THERE IS MISTAKE.

543
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:39,291
THERE IS SOMETHING
WE DO NOT SEE.

544
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,750
-YOU ARE IN DENIAL, MY FRIEND.

545
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,208
-GENTLEMEN...

546
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:43,375
AND LADY.

547
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,875
-DR. RICHARDSON.

548
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,125
WE WERE NOT EXPECTING YOU
TO ATTEND.

549
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,291
-DR. RICHARDSON,

550
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,916
WHERE IS DR. SHEPARD?

551
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:53,625
-AUSTIN HAS, UH, BEEN DELAYED.

552
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,000
-DELAYED?

553
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,041
[CHUCKLES]

554
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:01,333
THERE'S TOO MUCH COINCIDENCE.

555
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,666
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

556
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
[RADIO STATIC]

557
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,666
-IT'S GARBAGE
ON THIS BANDWIDTH.

558
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,416
-AH, COME ON.

559
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,333
LET'S GET IT TOGETHER, GUYS.

560
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,666
-I'M SORRY.

561
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:33,416
THOSE SUNSPOTS
ARE AFFECTING OUR EQUIPMENT.

562
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,791
WAIT A SECOND.

563
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,333
THEY'RE ON THE MOVE.

564
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,541
-SERGEANT, ISN'T THERE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO

565
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,208
ABOUT ALL THIS INTERFERENCE
WE'RE GETTING?

566
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,833
-NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.
YOU KNOW, I SUGGEST

567
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,458
YOU GET ALL YOUR PEOPLE
ON HARD LINES.

568
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,500
ANYTHING OVER SATELLITE'S
IFFY AT BEST.

569
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,291
THAT LAST MAGNETIC STORM

570
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:03,291
KNOCKED OUT 2 D.O.D.
COMMUNICATION BIRDS

571
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,291
AND ABOUT 50%
OF THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITES
THAT ARE UP THERE.

572
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,458
-REALLY?

573
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,666
-OH, YEAH.

574
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,333
JOINT CHIEFS HAVE ORDERED

575
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,958
THAT WHATEVER SATELLITES WE HAVE
THAT CAN STILL BE MOVED

576
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,750
BE PUT INTO
A GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT.

577
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,750
WE'RE GONNA HIDE THEM
BEHIND THE PLANET,

578
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,166
TRY TO PROTECT THEM
FROM ANY MORE DIRECT HITS
LIKE WE HAD LAST NIGHT.

579
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,666
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING

580
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,833
WE GOT FROM S.P.L.

581
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,083
WHATEVER MAGNETIC WAVES

582
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,500
AREN'T ABSORBED BY THE EARTH

583
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,833
JUST KIND OF FLOW AROUND IT.

584
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,166
ENVELOP IT LIKE A BLANKET.

585
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,958
YOU KNOW, THEY LOSE
SOME OF THEIR JUICE,

586
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:33,583
BUT A REALLY BIG ONE'S
GONNA KNOCK OUT
EVERYTHING ANYWAY.

587
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,125
Woman: JOSEPH, PLEASE.

588
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,625
ARE WE NOT BEING
A LITTLE PARANOID?

589
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,125
-MAYBE.

590
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,458
MAYBE NOT.

591
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,750
OK.

592
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,958
WHERE'S OUR GOOD FRIEND AUSTIN?

593
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,458
-AUSTIN'S MISSING.

594
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:02,000
-I THINK HE'S MISSING

595
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,166
LIKE IBRAHIM, YES?

596
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,333
-WHAT ABOUT IBRAHIM?

597
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,833
-SUICIDE.

598
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,500
AT LEAST, THAT IS

599
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,958
WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD.

600
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,625
-THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

601
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,833
JUST LIKE OLD SOVIET UNION.

602
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,625
S.S.S.R.

603
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,583
EVERY DEATH OF SCIENTIST--

604
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,125
SUICIDE.

605
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,291
-UH, JOSEPH,
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,

606
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,750
THAT--THAT HE WAS MURDERED?

607
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,916
-FIRST IBRAHIM.

608
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,291
NOW AUSTIN.

609
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,083
IT IS SAME OLD STORY--

610
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,750
K.G.B., C.I.A., N.I.O.

611
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,291
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

612
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,833
THEY ONLY WANT CONTROL.

613
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,250
-BUT WHY IBRAHIM?

614
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,416
WH-WHY WOULD THEY
WANT TO HURT HIM?

615
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,583
-BECAUSE OF WHAT AUSTIN
TOLD HIM.

616
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:42,625
-BECAUSE OF WHAT AUSTIN
TOLD ALL OF US.

617
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,791
-WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

618
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,416
-YOU BETTER SIT DOWN, MATE.

619
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:52,000
-DR. SHEPARD'S PLAN
FOR A SOLAR PROBE

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,458
WAS TO INVESTIGATE
THE SUN'S CORE GRAVITY.

621
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,458
THIS ALGORITHM HERE
IS A FORMULA

622
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,083
FOR HYDROGEN
CONVERSION TO HELIUM
BY NUCLEAR FUSION.

623
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:01,166
-SURE, THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN MY GUESS.

624
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,375
-IT'S THE PROCESS
AT THE SUN'S CORE

625
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,958
THAT CREATES THE HEAT.

626
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,208
NOW, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD.

627
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:11,041
WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND

628
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,375
IS HOW THAT...

629
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:16,041
RELATES TO THIS...

630
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,875
WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE

631
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,375
SOME SORT OF BREACH
IN THE CORONA,

632
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,250
THROUGH THE PHOTOSPHERE--

633
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,250
-AND INTO THE CHROMOSPHERE.

634
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,583
-HMM.

635
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,833
WHAT CAUSED THE BREACH?

636
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,583
-WELL, WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE,

637
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,416
BUT AUSTIN HAS ALWAYS THOUGHT

638
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:32,750
THAT THE SUN IS FAR OLDER

639
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,250
THAN WE'VE IMAGINED.

640
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,833
-THAT'S JUST A HYPOTHESIS.

641
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,333
THE SOLAR PROBE WAS BUILT

642
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,833
TO EXPLORE THAT ASSUMPTION.

643
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,208
-SAVE THE ROCKET FUEL,
CHRISTOPHER. IT IS SETTLED.

644
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,833
-I AM NOT CONVINCED.

645
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,416
-IF AUSTIN IS RIGHT--

646
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,333
-AND WE'VE BEEN WRONG
ABOUT THE AGE OF THE SUN,

647
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,750
SO WHAT?

648
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,583
-IF I'M READING THIS
CORRECTLY,

649
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,166
AUSTIN'S CONVINCED

650
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,666
THAT THIS BREACH

651
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,500
IS JUST THE BEGINNINGS
OF A PROCESS

652
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,041
THAT WILL RESULT IN--

653
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,666
-A SUPERNOVA.

654
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,166
-OUI.

655
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,375
THE END OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT.

656
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,291
-BUT OUR ESTEEMED
COLLEAGUE JOSEPH

657
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,958
DOESN'T SEEM TO AGREE

658
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,708
WITH AUSTIN'S CALCULATIONS.

659
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,875
-THERE IS TOO MUCH
WE DO NOT KNOW

660
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,541
ABOUT STAR MATURITY
AND DEATH.

661
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,541
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

662
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,875
LOOK.

663
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,541
LOOK RIGHT HERE.

664
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,708
HE IS MAKING AN ASSUMPTION

665
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,291
ABOUT CORE GRAVITY.

666
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,833
WHERE'D HE GET THIS ASSUMPTION?

667
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,208
-THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH IT.

668
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,958
-THE ASSUMPTION
MUST BE CORRECT, JOSEPH.

669
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:34,541
EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS

670
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,125
IS HAPPENING--

671
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,958
INTERFERENCE
WITH COMMUNICATIONS,

672
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,291
ANOMALOUS ANIMAL BEHAVIOR.

673
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,416
-A BREAKDOWN
OF THE MAGNETOSPHERE.

674
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:43,916
-SOMETHING IS WRONG.

675
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,166
I FEEL IT.

676
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,833
-RIGHT OR WRONG,

677
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,500
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO CONSIDER.

678
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,333
-WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL
THE PUBLIC?

679
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,500
-YOU TELL THE PUBLIC NOTHING.

680
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,500
MY NAME IS
SPECIAL AGENT DELGADO,

682
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,083
I MUST ASK YOU ALL
TO COME WITH ME NOW.

683
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,000
IN THE INTEREST OF SECURITY,

684
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,791
YOU WILL BE ESCORTED
TO A SECURE LOCATION

685
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,458
WHERE YOU WILL BE DEBRIEFED.

686
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,500
-ABOUT WHAT?
-DEBRIEFED?

687
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,083
-REPRESENTATIVES
FROM YOUR GOVERNMENTS

688
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,833
WILL BE AVAILABLE
TO DISCUSS
THE SITUATION WITH YOU.

689
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,333
-I HAVE NO INTEREST

690
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,333
IN GOING TO A SECURE LOCATION.

691
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,833
-I SECOND THAT.

692
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,375
-I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT
A MATTER OF CHOICE.

693
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,916
DR. RICHARDSON,

694
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,000
PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN

695
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,083
THE SERIOUSNESS
OF OUR INTENTIONS.

696
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,166
-THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT
STOLEN PROTOCOLS, WAS IT?

697
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,375
-UNH!

698
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,166
OOF!

699
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,708
-HE'S GETTING AWAY!

700
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:02,708
-GET HIM.

701
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,708
-STOP!

702
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:06,833
[GRUNTS]

703
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,166
-STOP!

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,958
-DR. CHENISLAV.

705
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:40,458
-DR. CHENISLAV.

706
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,625
WE'RE HERE
TO HELP YOU, SIR.

707
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:48,875
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET...

708
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,958
BUT PLEASE STAY CALM.
