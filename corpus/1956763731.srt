1
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:04,499
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,400
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:32,712
(wings flapping)

4
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:39,089
- Long ago, before the time of man

5
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:42,672
there lived a fairy
king whose name was Ar.

6
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,851
Now Ar lived in a land
called the Angel Isle

7
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:50,811
and he had ruled for 1,000 years

8
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:54,605
before the first man
set foot in his realm.

9
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,586
Now to the fairy king and his people
10

10
00:00:56,586 --> 00:01:01,306
men seemed large and loud,
quick tempered and destructive,
11

11
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:05,473
beings who had no time for
the gentle ways of fairy folk,
12

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,843
and before they realized what they did
13

13
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:13,673
the men drove Ar and his people
from the fields and woods
14

14
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,515
right up to the edge
of the deep green sea.
15

15
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:21,149
Now Ar was trapped and his
people could go no further
16

16
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,328
so in desperation the
fairy king sent a message
17

17
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:27,484
to the Emerald Isle asking for help
18

18
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:30,151
from Timish the leprechaun king,
19

19
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:39,192
but Timish was powerless to help
20

20
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:43,614
as Ar and the fairy folk were
barred from the Emerald Isle,
21

21
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:47,135
but still he could not turn
his back on his cousin Ar
22

22
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:51,302
and therefor he asked the
giant Fin McCool for help.
23

23
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,301
- A giant?
24

24
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,747
- Yes Evie a giant.
25

25
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,281
- Evie shh.
26

26
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,890
- Shh yourself.
27

27
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,115
- Well Fin McCool was usually a bad giant,
28

28
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:06,545
but in this case he was pleased
to help the people of Ar
29

29
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,365
in return for the hand in marriage
30

30
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:12,098
of Ar's daughter Tumbeleen.
31

31
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,239
Tumbeleen was very sad at the
thought of marriage to a giant
32

32
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,263
but after her father persuaded
her she finally agreed,
33

33
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:23,627
so Timish struck the deal with Fin McCool
34

34
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:26,954
and as the fairy folk
rejoiced the lumbering giant
35

35
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:30,210
ripped up a huge piece of the Emerald Isle
36

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,149
and throwing back his mighty
arm he set the piece of land
37

37
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:37,399
sailing through the air across the sea.
38

38
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,575
- Cool.
39

39
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:44,871
- Well when the noise had
settled and the water grew calm
40

40
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,333
the giant's voice boomed across the sea
41

41
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,847
telling Ar and his people that
the new land he had created
42

42
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:53,661
was to be called the Isle of Man
43

43
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,412
in honor of the king of the sea,
44

44
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,966
but that Ar and his
people could live there
45

45
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:01,498
for as long as Tumbeleen was his wife.
46

46
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:02,915
- Poor Tumbeleen.
47

47
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:06,172
- Ah wait and see.
48

48
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:10,703
So Ar took his people to the new land
49

49
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:13,330
and he made ready for a huge celebration
50

50
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,491
to which he invited the giant.
51

51
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,500
Tumbeleen was dressed in fairest silks
52

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,274
with dainty flowers for a crown
53

53
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:23,649
ready to be the giant's bride
54

54
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:26,488
and waited at the cliff's
with Ar and all his people
55

55
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:30,011
as Fin McCool waded from the Emerald Isle
56

56
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,344
to the new land he had made.
57

57
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,115
Well the giant's voice booms out,
58

58
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:42,172
"Oh fairy king I have done what you asked,
59

59
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,948
"now I come for my bride,"
60

60
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:47,437
and to the amazement of all those around
61

61
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,928
Ar laughed and laughed.
62

62
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:52,958
"Oh foolish giant how can that be?
63

63
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,914
"You are too large to
live on this little land
64

64
00:03:55,914 --> 00:04:00,133
"and Tumbeleen is forever
barred from the Emerald Isle,
65

65
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,324
"where would you live?"
66

66
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:05,183
- Hooray Tumbeleen is
safe, she's safe Grandma.
67

67
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:06,850
- Well, only partly,
68

68
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,465
but one day, one can only hope.
69

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,793
- Grandma?
70

70
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,050
- What?
71

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,883
Oh sorry.
72

72
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:22,300
Right, where was I?
73

73
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,382
Yes here we are.
74

74
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:27,984
Now as you can imagine the
giant was not too pleased,
75

75
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,902
in fact he was downright
furious at being tricked
76

76
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:36,004
and in his rage he scooped
up all of Ar's people
77

77
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:39,587
in his giant hand and with
the other he tore a large hole
78

78
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:43,461
and there he placed Ar and all his people
79

79
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:47,628
covering them with dirt, he
buried them deep underground
80

80
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:52,082
and his voice boomed out across the sea,
81

81
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,582
"King Ar, oh treacherous fool,
82

82
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:59,236
"the land that I gave you so
that you might live in peace
83

83
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:02,319
"shall now be a prison forever more."
84

84
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,992
(joyful music)
85

85
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:21,972
- Look the Fairy Bridge.
86

86
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:23,598
- [Nancy] It's so beautiful.
87

87
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,308
- Remember in the story
when you cross the bridge
88

88
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:26,678
you have to say hi to the fairies
89

89
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,404
or they give you bad luck.
90

90
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:29,687
(wings flapping)
91

91
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,053
(magical swooshing)
92

92
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,053
- [Children] Hi fairies.
93

93
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:36,738
- Evie see if you can see one.
94

94
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,997
(wings flapping)
95

95
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,573
- Daddy I saw one.
96

96
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:42,406
- Great.
97

97
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,989
(joyful music)
98

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,550
(magical swooshing)
99

99
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,988
(wings flapping)
100

100
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:03,915
(magical swooshing)
101

101
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,498
(joyful music)
102

102
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,505
- Wow look at this place.
103

103
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:46,608
- Yeah, where is Hansel and Gretel huh?
104

104
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,147
(laughing)
105

105
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,016
- [Kyle] This is Grandma's?
106

106
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:53,313
(talking drown out by music)
107

107
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,562
- Wow this is ares?
108

108
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:58,555
- Yeah I guess, I guess it is.
109

109
00:06:58,555 --> 00:06:59,949
- Cool.
110

110
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,860
- Hey, what do you say we check it out?
111

111
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,456
- [Children] Yeah.
112

112
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:07,039
(joyful music)
113

113
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,444
- Kyle, Kyle back up here.
114

114
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,215
Well nobody's lived here for 40 years,
115

115
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:35,370
but everything, the grounds are very neat,
116

116
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,859
electricity works.
117

117
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:39,513
- Well I guess there's a caretaker.
118

118
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:43,680
- I wonder why your mother
never, never came back here?
119

119
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,152
Hello?
120

120
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:47,985
- Come on Evie.
121

121
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:48,979
- 'Kay, wait for me.
122

122
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,988
- Hey hey hey careful,
don't break anything.
123

123
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:56,155
(joyful music)
(magical swooshing)
124

124
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,897
(wings flapping)
125

125
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,480
(joyful music)
126

126
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,423
- [Rob] Where is everybody?
127

127
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,420
- It's weird.
128

128
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,808
- Hey, look at all this old stuff.
129

129
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,641
Oh, and pots and pans.
130

130
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,550
(laughing)
131

131
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:41,673
It's real alright.
132

132
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:42,840
- Water works.
133

133
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,962
I wonder where the TV is.
134

134
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:53,014
Watch out Evie the TV's mine.
135

135
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,014
Wait for me.
136

136
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:55,828
- Hey!
(screaming)
137

137
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,497
What the hell's going on?
138

138
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,212
Walk down you, hey.
139

139
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:00,069
What the devil?
140

140
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:00,902
- What is that?
- Evie?
141

141
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:03,334
(crying)
142

142
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,617
- Stop it.
- Hey, hey hey let them go.
143

143
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:09,325
- Who are you? You shouldn't be here.
144

144
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,492
- Let them go.
145

145
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:12,812
This is our house.
146

146
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:15,247
- Nobody lives here.
147

147
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,434
- [Rob] They do now.
148

148
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:18,205
- This is my mother's house.
149

149
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,205
- Elizabeth?
150

150
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:21,461
- Who are you?
151

151
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,294
- I'm Ian, I'm the caretaker here.
152

152
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,490
- What the hell do you
think you were doing?
153

153
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,073
- I'm doing my job,
keeping strangers away.
154

154
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:37,508
This is a dangerous place,
you shouldn't be here.
155

155
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,487
- I'm sorry I think you should go,
156

156
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,131
please, could you take your dog?
157

157
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,563
Let's go, go on, come on, come on dog, go.
158

158
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:46,896
(whistling)
159

159
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,137
You just stay away from my kids.
160

160
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:51,970
(whistling)
- Come on.
161

161
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,885
- Go on dog.
162

162
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:55,052
(barking)
163

163
00:09:56,865 --> 00:10:01,032
- Only death lives here.
(foreboding music)
164

164
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:07,180
Foreigners, oh what are you looking at?
165

165
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,013
Come on.
166

166
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,187
(whistling)
167

167
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:13,255
Come on.
168

168
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:21,568
- Why do I feel like we just
ended a Stephen King novel?
169

169
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:22,774
- What do you say we unwrap this place
170

170
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,444
like a big Christmas present?
171

171
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:25,944
- [Children] Yeah.
172

172
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,800
(laughing)
173

173
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:35,521
(mysterious music)
174

174
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:42,622
(banging)
175

175
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:44,577
- [Nancy] Hey careful with that.
176

176
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,523
- [Rob] Slow down guys slow down.
177

177
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:47,356
- [Kyle] It's all old stuff.
178

178
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,827
- [Rob] Slow down, that's
an antique, that's not old.
179

179
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:50,233
- Look what's here.
- Look at this stuff Dad.
180

180
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,374
- Careful we don't know what's
under all this stuff, huh?
181

181
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:55,291
Ah, Nancy--
182

182
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,606
(foreboding music)
183

183
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,189
- Mom, Dad, look what we found.
184

184
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:04,456
(foreboding music)
185

185
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,608
It's the fairy.
186

186
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:14,295
- Ew, what a horrible picture,
what are those things?
187

187
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:18,045
- It's goblins Mom, you
know, wicked fairies,
188

188
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,778
they live underground.
189

189
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,396
- It's in Grandma's book.
190

190
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:23,229
- [Rob] It's interesting.
191

191
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,145
- Yeah well I don't like
it, can we take it down?
192

192
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,728
- Yeah, let me see.
193

193
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:36,363
I'm afraid not, looks like
it's bolted to the wall.
194

194
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,872
- Look what I found.
195

195
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,653
- Careful.
196

196
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,653
- Ooh now that's better.
197

197
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,744
Hey let's take it outside.
198

198
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:54,573
(dramatic music)
199

199
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,593
(swooshing)
200

200
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,850
(laughing)
201

201
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,113
There, let's hope they bring us luck.
202

202
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,906
(clinking)
203

203
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:21,011
Oh god it's beautiful.
204

204
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,429
I wonder how much property there is.
205

205
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,942
- You know the letter
didn't really say did it?
206

206
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,359
- Well I love it.
207

207
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,457
I'm glad we came,
208

208
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:36,403
Mom would be so pleased that
we're all here together.
209

209
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,653
- Well so am I.
210

210
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,188
- We need this.
211

211
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,374
(coughing)
212

212
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,763
Rob we've got to do something about that.
213

213
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,513
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
214

214
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:55,540
(wings flapping)
215

215
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,123
(joyful music)
216

216
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:02,115
(swooshing)
217

217
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:06,221
I'm sorry I haven't been there.
218

218
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,305
- Well you are now.
219

219
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,232
Hey, who would've thought
someone as ugly as you
220

220
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:17,344
would have married someone
as wonderful as me?
221

221
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,677
- That is an understatement.
222

222
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:21,738
(swooshing)
223

223
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:22,738
- Kyle look.
224

224
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,518
(joyful music)
225

225
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:29,967
(laughing)
226

226
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,717
(wings flapping)
227

227
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:46,288
Don't worry, we'll save
you, we promised Grandma.
228

228
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:50,471
Mom, Dad look.
229

229
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,766
(swooshing)
230

230
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,723
- Fireflies.
231

231
00:13:57,723 --> 00:13:59,548
- Look it right there.
232

232
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,631
- Incredible.
233

233
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:04,145
(joyful music)
234

234
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,700
(sizzling)
235

235
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,567
- Smells good.
236

236
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,285
So what is this?
237

237
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,640
- An English breakfast.
238

238
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
- Oh, I'm gonna get fat.
239

239
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,588
Where are the kids?
240

240
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:35,449
- They were up and out hours ago.
241

241
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:39,619
Oh I made an appointment
for you at the doctors.
242

242
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:40,702
- Okay, okay.
243

243
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,321
(suspenseful music)
244

244
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,140
- Hi.
245

245
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,390
You're the fairy, I'm Evie.
246

246
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,246
(laughing)
247

247
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,246
Wait for me.
248

248
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,947
- Evie where you going?
249

249
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:45,967
Evie?
250

250
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:47,777
- Hey.
251

251
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:51,880
Hey what do you want?
252

252
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,713
- Nothing.
253

253
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,857
- Well who are you running from, eh?
254

254
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:57,025
- We weren't running from nothing,
255

255
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,232
we were playing.
(swooshing)
256

256
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,184
- With the fairies.
257

257
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:01,017
- Hmm?
258

258
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,921
With the what?
259

259
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,499
- Where'd she go?
260

260
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,515
- Ah she's just being stupid.
261

261
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,775
- [Ian] Well you shouldn't
be playing around here
262

262
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,676
and why don't you tell
your mom and dad to leave?
263

263
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,798
- [Kyle] Why should we? It's our house.
264

264
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:20,717
- Is it? Nobody owns this house,
265

265
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,687
and all the monsters that live in it
266

266
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,591
and you shouldn't be
playing in these woods.
267

267
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,068
If you do they'll be watching you.
268

268
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:30,332
They like to eat small children.
269

269
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,156
- Ah you're just acting crazy.
270

270
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,739
- Oh am I? Hey don't
say I didn't warn you.
271

271
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:37,785
Ow.
272

272
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:43,218
(dramatic music)
273

273
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,964
(swooshing)
274

274
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:54,329
- Rob, I'm going to take Evie
and Kyle into the village
275

275
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,366
and do some shopping, I'll
drop you off at the doctor.
276

276
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:57,720
- Oh right, yeah I was thinking,
277

277
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,892
maybe I'll take Kyle with me
278

278
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,465
and stop off at the church afterwards
279

279
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:04,136
and see if they keep any
records on this place.
280

280
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:06,711
- Hey take it easy, you alright?
281

281
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:08,467
- We saw that--
- Evie met a fairy.
282

282
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:09,568
- Really?
283

283
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,281
- Yeah she lives under the bridge.
284

284
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,657
- Hey, friends already,
you guys ready to go?
285

285
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,195
- Yeah I'll meet you
guys in the car, I gotta,
286

286
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:17,342
I think my wallet's upstairs.
287

287
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:20,592
- Okay, come on, let's wait in the car.
288

288
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,587
- Why didn't you tell them about that man?
289

289
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:26,205
- 'Cause he's crazy,
290

290
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:28,506
I didn't want to worry
Dad so he'd want to leave.
291

291
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,410
- But he said the monsters will get us.
292

292
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,761
- Evie he's just trying to scare us.
293

293
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,580
- No you heard what Grandma said.
294

294
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,330
- Evie it's just a dumb story
in a book Grandma wrote.
295

295
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,807
Look hasn't Dad changed?
296

296
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:45,459
Is it more fun, isn't it better here?
297

297
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:46,292
- Yeah.
298

298
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,176
- We have to keep him here Evie
299

299
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:52,016
or else he's gonna go away
and we'll never see him again
300

300
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:53,956
just like before.
301

301
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,117
- We still have to save the fairies.
302

302
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,367
- Hey come on guys, let's go, let's go.
303

303
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,297
- We promised Grandma.
304

304
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,740
(dramatic music)
305

305
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:27,800
(wings flapping)
(playful music)
306

306
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,685
- Was that you?
307

307
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,884
(wings flapping)
(playful music)
308

308
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,421
What in the devil?
309

309
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,631
What the devil?
310

310
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,043
Now we know, we know don't we Tippit?
311

311
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,226
Alright we know.
312

312
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,944
You don't frighten me
with your little tricks.
313

313
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,898
(barking)
314

314
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:05,731
Whoa, hey.
315

315
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,405
(barking)
316

316
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,655
(laughing)
317

317
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,293
Hey.
318

318
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:21,924
- Take that when you need it,
319

319
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:24,137
and in the meantime I'll call
you when I hear from the lab.
320

320
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:25,442
- Alright thank you.
321

321
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,550
- And take it easy, no strenuous exercise.
322

322
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,383
- Alright.
323

323
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:37,182
- You alright?
- Yeah.
324

324
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,616
- Hmm, they don't look very nice.
325

325
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,053
(suspenseful music)
326

326
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:10,886
- Mom?
327

327
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:14,045
- I know honey.
328

328
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,003
You know it's rude to stare.
329

329
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:17,691
- Dad.
330

330
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:20,432
Firefly.
331

331
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,182
- Good job, good job.
332

332
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,997
Here roll that out slowly,
don't want to rip it.
333

333
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:33,580
There we are, Firefly
Mine, claim 18, gold.
334

334
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:39,426
According to this there's
a goldmine on the property.
335

335
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,966
- Grandma owned a goldmine?
336

336
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:43,216
- That's what it says here.
337

337
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:50,841
- Can I help you?
338

338
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:56,186
- Yes, we were just
looking for the records
339

339
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,353
for the Ballaugh property.
340

340
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:02,492
- Ballaugh, may I ask who wants to know?
341

341
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:05,869
- I'm sorry I'm Rob Preston, this is my,
342

342
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:07,862
this is my son, he's the new owner.
343

343
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:10,087
- We don't have any information
on the Ballaugh property.
344

344
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,225
- Well surely there must be something?
345

345
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,719
- There isn't any, not as far as I know.
346

346
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,432
Now if you'll excuse me?
347

347
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:18,349
- Sure, yeah of course.
348

348
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:23,560
Thank you.
349

349
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:39,770
(swooshing)
(joyful music)
350

350
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,100
I don't get it, it's
gotta be here somewhere,
351

351
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,795
look there's the water right there right?
352

352
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:56,186
Well it's gotta be right here somewhere,
353

353
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,353
we must be standing on it.
354

354
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:02,599
- Dad.
355

355
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,236
- What is that? Come here.
356

356
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,010
That's gold, Kyle that's gold, where?
357

357
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,991
Here come here, take the
map, look right around here.
358

358
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:15,074
Nancy, Nancy!
359

359
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,780
(dramatic music)
360

360
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,282
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy look at this.
361

361
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,776
- Why what is it?
362

362
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:26,418
- Gold, Kyle found it down in the creek.
363

363
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:27,749
- Gold?
- Yes.
364

364
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,683
- You've dug this out of the creek?
365

365
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,433
- Supposedly there's a
goldmine here somewhere,
366

366
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,466
we haven't found any trace of it yet,
367

367
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:35,282
but we found a map at the
church that said Firefly Mine.
368

368
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:36,115
- [Nancy] Firefly?
369

369
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:37,663
- Do you remember what your mother said?
370

370
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:40,225
Fireflies, remember?
- No I--
371

371
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:42,713
- Nancy, she's left us a goldmine.
372

372
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,324
- No.
- Yeah.
373

373
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:47,026
- Dad, I found it, I found the mine.
374

374
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:49,284
- You found what mine?
- Where, where?
375

375
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:50,117
- [Kyle] Come on follow me.
376

376
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:51,264
- Show me where?
- Wait for me.
377

377
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:54,013
- What are you talking about?
378

378
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:56,487
- Look, look there's the mine.
379

379
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:57,759
- Where?
- Right there.
380

380
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,195
- You're right, right there it is,
381

381
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:01,954
Nancy Nancy look come here.
382

382
00:25:01,954 --> 00:25:03,287
It's under here.
383

383
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,558
See there it is, it's right under there,
384

384
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:10,548
Nancy look it's right
there, we own a goldmine.
385

385
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:12,478
- We're rich.
- Yay.
386

386
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:13,571
- Can we open it Dad, can we?
387

387
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:15,080
- Oh you betcha but
we're gonna need a pump,
388

388
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,393
there must be some pump around here,
389

389
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:18,392
it's probably old or rusted or something.
390

390
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,521
Nancy you guys check over here
391

391
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:21,298
Kyle let's look over here.
392

392
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:23,944
- Yeah I've got to see
this mine, where is it?
393

393
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:25,524
Is that it?
394

394
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,622
It's hard to imagine there's
a mine under all this water.
395

395
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:32,205
- Nancy, Nancy, can I
have a word with you?
396

396
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,680
- Oh no, what now?
397

397
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:40,284
- Nancy, you don't mind
if I call you that?
398

398
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:43,458
I'd just like to
apologize about yesterday.
399

399
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,808
- Yeah well you scared Evie.
400

400
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:47,934
- I know I'm sorry, sorry
Evie I didn't mean to.
401

401
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,325
It's just that I didn't
know you were coming.
402

402
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,718
- Well didn't the solicitors tell you?
403

403
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,004
- No, nobody mentioned it to me.
404

404
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,725
- Well I'm sorry.
405

405
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,308
You knew my mother?
406

406
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:01,252
- Yes well actually we were cousins.
407

407
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:06,961
I supposed that makes us all family.
408

408
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:11,513
- Really well I didn't realize. (laughing)
409

409
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:15,144
Oh well it's very beautiful
around here, peaceful.
410

410
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:17,523
- Yes well don't be fooled,
411

411
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:20,896
it may look beautiful on
the surface, but the pond,
412

412
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:24,813
the house, it's all
tainted, tainted with evil.
413

413
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:28,087
- What's that supposed to mean?
414

414
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,610
- It means that anyone with any sense
415

415
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,897
will stay well away from this place.
416

416
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:33,348
- Really?
417

417
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:34,976
- A lot of people have died here.
418

418
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:37,887
Please I wouldn't want you to be next.
419

419
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,470
- Hey, hey hey hey.
420

420
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,486
What're you doing here?
421

421
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:47,983
- No you can't, you must be
mad, you can't drain that pond.
422

422
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:52,410
- Yeah here we go again, look
I'm mad, this is our pond,
423

423
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,886
this is our house, if we want to drain it,
424

424
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:57,618
then that's exactly what we'll do
425

425
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,146
and you better get used to the idea.
426

426
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:00,572
- You're making a mistake,
427

427
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:04,042
a big mistake, look
Elizabeth knew, she knew,
428

428
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,715
that's why we took here away from here.
429

429
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:08,609
- Knew what, that there
was a goldmine in here?
430

430
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:09,715
Yeah maybe that's why you're so keen
431

431
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:10,933
to keep people away huh?
432

432
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,753
So you can keep it all to yourself?
433

433
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:15,420
- You know about the mine?
- I sure do.
434

434
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,741
It's deep huh?
435

435
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:19,269
- Please you've got to listen
to me, don't open that mine.
436

436
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:21,511
You open that mine,
you'll free the demons.
437

437
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:22,344
- Demons?
438

438
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,863
Please just go away.
439

439
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:26,696
Come on Kyle, go away.
440

440
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:36,776
- Alright, I'll go,
441

441
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:40,237
but before this is over,
442

442
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:42,575
you'll be needing me.
443

443
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,618
- Okay well thank you very
much, we'll remember that,
444

444
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:48,823
leave your phone number at the
front door, bye, thank you.
445

445
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:49,959
- You okay Mom?
446

446
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,010
- Yeah, yeah honey, so
where did you find this?
447

447
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,223
- Oh it's in a box right over there.
448

448
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:55,387
In fact Evie I want you to run over there,
449

449
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:56,710
see that brown box,
450

450
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,660
when I tell you to
you'll see a red switch,
451

451
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,077
I want you to hit it alright?
452

452
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,217
Hope this is gonna work.
453

453
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:08,788
Kyle get ready.
454

454
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,168
- Ready?
455

455
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:11,085
- Go ahead.
456

456
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,000
(motor running)
457

457
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:23,527
- Yay it works.
458

458
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:26,708
(wings flapping)
459

459
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,077
- Alright look this is
gonna take a while to drain,
460

460
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:29,852
I'm starving, let's go inside
and get something to eat,
461

461
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:30,685
we'll come back in a little while,
462

462
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:33,657
and don't you worry there's
a lunatic in every family.
463

463
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:35,134
- Yeah well there is in yours.
464

464
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,426
- Who would that be? (speaking goofily)
465

465
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:39,100
(laughing)
466

466
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,807
(coughing)
467

467
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,557
(dramatic music)
468

468
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:51,339
(swooshing)
469

469
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:52,339
- The fools.
470

470
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:55,227
God.
471

471
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:58,664
Bloody fools.
472

472
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:10,307
(dramatic music)
473

473
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:23,533
(laughing)
474

474
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:24,742
I'll show him.
475

475
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:29,583
Then they'll have to
believe me. (laughing)
476

476
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,994
I'll show 'em, what do
you think about that?
477

477
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:35,332
What do you think about that?
478

478
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:37,499
Yeah, you're a lovely dog.
479

479
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:39,379
(laughing)
480

480
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:42,452
- Uh oh it's starting
to wobble, whoa, whoa,
481

481
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:44,765
it's going to fall down, whoa.
482

482
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:48,932
(laughing)
(coughing)
483

483
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:54,256
(laughing)
484

484
00:29:54,256 --> 00:29:56,480
- Hey quit having so much fun.
485

485
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,632
- Oh I gotcha girl.
486

486
00:29:58,632 --> 00:29:59,465
Okay.
487

487
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,584
- Time for bed Kyle, come on Evie.
488

488
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:06,048
- Off to bed, up you go like
a rocket, one, two, three.
489

489
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:07,076
- Here you are darling.
490

490
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:08,409
- I want a pony.
491

491
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,918
- We're not rich yet.
492

492
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,376
- I want one daddy.
493

493
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,624
- Hey you know there might
not be anything down there.
494

494
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:18,619
But we'll find out tomorrow won't we?
495

495
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,869
Goodnight Kyle.
496

496
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:28,068
- Goodnight my little
scrumptious bumtious. (smooching)
497

497
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:31,434
- Alright in we go, in we go, in we go.
498

498
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:34,934
Big kiss huh? (smooching)
499

499
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:38,968
(coughing)
500

500
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,635
Alright, night guys.
501

501
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,241
- Night.
- Goodnight Dad.
502

502
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:47,324
- Night. (smooching)
503

503
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,640
(dramatic music)
504

504
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:07,845
- They're so beautiful, they
want us to save them Kyle.
505

505
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,543
- Save who from what?
506

506
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:18,799
Who are you waving to?
507

507
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,049
- [Evie] The fairies, who do you think?
508

508
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:26,269
- What?
509

509
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:29,019
(dramatic music)
510

510
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,284
You're so weird.
511

511
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:48,360
(swooshing)
(dramatic music)
512

512
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,155
- What's a matter?
513

513
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:10,905
- Oh nothing I guess.
514

514
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,943
It's just, what if Ian's right?
515

515
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,938
- What, what that we have
monsters in our garden?
516

516
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,418
- No, but it could be
dangerous opening an old mine,
517

517
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:27,314
and what did he mean when he said Mom knew
518

518
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,569
and being then being taken away?
519

519
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:31,404
- Oh Nancy I have no idea,
but don't let it get to you,
520

520
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:33,133
look at this.
521

521
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,953
- Why are these people so against us,
522

522
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,244
what have we done to make them hate us?
523

523
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:39,083
- They're not against
us, we're just newcomers,
524

524
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:42,638
you know that in 20 years,
we're still gonna be newcomers.
525

525
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:44,777
- Yeah but I don't think I want
to hang around for 20 years.
526

526
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:46,020
- Well do you want to go home?
527

527
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,208
- No no of course not.
528

528
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:51,061
- Want to get under the covers with me?
529

529
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:52,727
- Maybe.
530

530
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:54,749
- Want some gold?
531

531
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:56,000
- Definitely.
532

532
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,833
(laughing)
533

533
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,122
Come on give it to me,
534

534
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:58,955
I want it.
- Here it is, come and get it,
535

535
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,649
come and get it.
536

536
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:02,376
(foreboding music)
537

537
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:05,293
(rubble exploding)
538

538
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,835
(grunting)
(crashing)
539

539
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:17,713
(growling)
540

540
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:20,546
(rubble crashing)
541

541
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:27,376
(groaning)
542

542
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:41,119
(dramatic music)
543

543
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,036
- [Man] Demons, demons!
544

544
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:50,117
- Let go of me, let go, stop it, let go.
545

545
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:51,925
Dad!
546

546
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:53,874
Dad.
547

547
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:59,760
- Kyle, Kyle you okay, what?
548

548
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,427
- What's wrong Kyle?
549

549
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:06,663
- I had a bad dream about
the mine and the goblins.
550

550
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,952
- Just a dream Kyle, just a dream.
551

551
00:34:12,568 --> 00:34:14,755
- It's all this talk
of fairies and demons.
552

552
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,972
Come on darling lie down,
553

553
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,924
just close your eyes and go to sleep,
554

554
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,841
think good thoughts, it's all right.
555

555
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,284
- [Evie] Mom?
556

556
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:26,617
- Evie back to bed, come on.
557

557
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,563
There you go.
558

558
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:34,499
Okay back to sleep.
559

559
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:35,332
Good girl.
560

560
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:40,101
Ian has a lot to answer for.
561

561
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:44,409
- You'll be alright okay?
562

562
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,409
I'll leave the light on.
563

563
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,247
- Can I sleep with you?
564

564
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:29,722
(water pouring)
565

565
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:49,964
(suspenseful music)
(swooshing)
566

566
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:52,791
(knocking)
567

567
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:55,041
(groaning)
568

568
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,993
- Who's that?
569

569
00:35:56,993 --> 00:36:00,390
- I don't know, what time is it?
570

570
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,616
It's six o'clock.
571

571
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:05,449
(rooster crowing)
572

572
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:10,601
- [Nancy] It's alright,
573

573
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:14,018
it's just someone at the door that's all.
574

574
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:24,825
- Got you out of bed a bit early have I?
575

575
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:27,024
- Yeah, yeah something like that.
576

576
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:29,965
- Sorry about that,
early risers around here.
577

577
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:32,444
Jim Blythe, local constabulary.
578

578
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:34,277
- Hi, hi, Rob Preston.
579

579
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,443
- Bit early for a cup of tea is it?
580

580
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:42,993
Or will that be coffee,
why you being an American?
581

581
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:43,910
- Whatever.
582

582
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:48,139
- Morning Mom.
583

583
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:48,972
- [Nancy] Good morning.
584

584
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:51,667
- [Jim] It's only a visit.
585

585
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,500
(rooster crowing)
586

586
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:14,039
- [Rob] Ah yeah sure,
here she is, here she is.
587

587
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,156
- Thank you Mom.
588

588
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:20,865
- So to what do we owe the pleasure?
589

589
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,420
- Oh just a social call.
590

590
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,366
We like to know who's moving
in and who's moving out.
591

591
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:28,577
- Do you want us to move out?
592

592
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:30,424
- What ever gave you that idea?
593

593
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:31,320
- Well if you don't,
594

594
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,755
you're the only one in town who doesn't.
595

595
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:35,857
- Oh you shouldn't take too much to store
596

596
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:38,210
in what people say around here Mom.
597

597
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,336
They mean no harm, they're
just suspicious that's all
598

598
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,671
and this property of yours
599

599
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:45,132
has got its fair share of history.
600

600
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,684
- Well like what exactly?
601

601
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:47,790
- A couple of miners were killed
602

602
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,869
when the mine was closed down.
603

603
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,702
Way back in 1800's I think it was.
604

604
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,884
- Why'd they close it down?
605

605
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:58,598
- Well one day they opened up a knew gap
606

606
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:00,488
and a pile of creatures swarmed out.
607

607
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,014
- [Rob And Nancy] Creatures?
608

608
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:06,772
- Some of the locals think
they're still down there.
609

609
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:09,855
- Well you don't believe that do you?
610

610
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:17,897
- I didn't say I did, but some
of the folk around here do.
611

611
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:18,730
- Well you're aware
612

612
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,366
that there may be gold down in that mine?
613

613
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,116
- Aye, so I've heard.
614

614
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,355
- Are you not from around here?
615

615
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:29,507
- No, Lanchester lad,
been here for 15 years,
616

616
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,674
but I'm still an outsider.
617

617
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,033
- Do you think maybe that,
618

618
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,612
maybe these people are
trying to frighten us
619

619
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:39,889
so they can get their
greedy hands on the gold?
620

620
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,972
- No Mr. Preston I don't.
621

621
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:45,733
Things go a lot deeper
than that around here.
622

622
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:49,900
I'm afraid you're into
something far bigger than greed.
623

623
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,276
Well you'll call me if you need me?
624

624
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,785
- Will I, need you?
625

625
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:02,702
- Not if you leave your mine alone.
626

626
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:07,846
Nice to have met you Mom,
thanks for the coffee.
627

627
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,929
I'll make me own way out.
628

628
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:19,547
(laughing)
629

629
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:20,380
- What ever happened to,
630

630
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,572
"hi nice to meet you,
welcome to the community,"
631

631
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:26,703
I think it rains too much on these people.
632

632
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:28,703
- Are we gonna leave?
633

633
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:31,043
- No, no, 'cause I
don't believe in demons,
634

634
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,310
I don't believe in goblins and
I don't believe in fairies.
635

635
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,991
No we're not going anywhere
until we decide to.
636

636
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:39,491
Now, why don't we get dressed.
637

637
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:44,974
I think I want to check
out that gold mine.
638

638
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:51,178
- It's the fairies from Grandma's story.
639

639
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:52,117
- What?
640

640
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:55,235
- You know Tumbeleen and
the fairy folk of Ar,
641

641
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:57,173
they're trapped underground.
642

642
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:59,173
- Evie you're so stupid.
643

643

(shouting)
648

648
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,837
- Right, I've got you now,
649

649
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:49,148

650

650
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:52,148
(magical swooshing)
651

651
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:02,224
(shattering)
652

652
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:05,130
What, where, where'd it go?
653

653
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,854
(swooshing)
654

654
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,646

Oh Rob I don't like this, I
mean nevermind the legend,
674

674
00:42:30,287 --> 00:42:32,108
but I think you should
leave this mine alone
675

675
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:33,705
it's old and dangerous.
676

676
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:35,931
- Relax we're gonna be fine.
677

677
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,175
- Can I go with you?
678

678
00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:40,103
- No, I think I better go first huh?
679

679
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:41,238
- Okay.

00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:31,312
- Wow.

710

00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:33,816

00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,226
(foreboding music)
713

713
00:44:58,272 --> 00:45:01,689
The gateway to hell, September 22nd 1887.
714

714
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:07,187
- Whoa. (nervously laughing)

718

718
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:15,992

00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,705
Here take my hand, take my hand.
720

720
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:22,122
Be very careful now, wait wait wait wait.

721
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:27,833
Alright, watch where you're walking.
722

722
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,097
Now hold on, hold on, we'll

723

723
00:45:35,097 --> 00:45:36,750
and we'll drain the rest of this.
724

Here take this, take.

725
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:47,832
(splashing)
726

726
00:45:54,164 --> 00:45:55,331

00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,759
Kyle, are you okay?
728

728

738

738
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:22,344
I've ever seen in my entire life.
739

739
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:24,677
- Can I see, can I please?
- Evie not now.
740

740
00:46:24,677 --> 00:46:25,852
- A bit later Evie,
741

741
00:46:25,852 --> 00:46:27,837
come on let's get you
into a nice warm bath.

743

743
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,774

744

744
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:32,607
you'll catch a cold Kyle, come on inside.
745

745
00:46:32,607 --> 00:46:34,857
(coughing)
746

746
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:40,162
(dramatic music)
747

747
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,013

748

748
00:46:42,013 --> 00:46:44,263
(coughing)
749

749
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:50,661
(swooshing)
(wings flapping)
750

750
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:59,037
(heavy coughing)
751

751
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:06,553
(crashing)
752

752
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:09,303
(dramatic music)
753

753
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,167
- Dad.
- Daddy.
754

754
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,125
- [Kyle] Dad.
755

755
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,297
- Call 999, get an ambulance.
756

756
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:21,630
- Daddy?
- Hurry.
757

757
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:24,636
- Daddy?
758

758
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:37,016
- Mrs. Preston we've got the
results of the test we did.
759

759
00:47:37,016 --> 00:47:40,129
I'm afraid there's no
easy way to say this,
760

760
00:47:40,129 --> 00:47:43,053
your husband's very sick Mrs. Preston,
761

761
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:45,162
but we'll know more in a couple of days,
762

762
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,078
but there's not much we can do
763

763
00:47:47,078 --> 00:47:50,447
except help him stay as
comfortable as possible.
764

764
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:52,697
- Well what are you saying?
765

765
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:57,942
- With rest and medication, he
may have two or three months.
766

766
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:01,353
- He's going to die?
767

767
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,406
- I suggest you take him home.
768

768
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:10,023
He'll be better off in the States there.
769

769
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:14,023
They're better equipped
for, this sort of thing.
770

770
00:48:16,468 --> 00:48:17,301
I'm sorry.
771

771
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:21,115
(dramatic music)
772

772
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,913
- When is Daddy coming home?
773

773
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,719
- They said he could come
home in a couple of days.
774

774
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,072
(dramatic music)
775

775
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:43,822
- What does Dad have?
776

776
00:48:49,775 --> 00:48:50,775
- Come here.
777

777
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:56,193
Your father,
778

778
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:01,998
he's very sick.
779

779
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:07,308
- Is he going to die like Grandma?
780

780
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:17,449
- I want you to do
something for me right now,
781

781
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,168
I want you to pray, I
want you to pray to god,
782

782
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:26,739
and ask him for a miracle.
783

783
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:29,489
(dramatic music)
784

784
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:55,554
(magical swooshing)
785

785
00:49:56,505 --> 00:49:59,076
(groaning)
786

786
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:01,390
- Let go, let me go.
787

787
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,223
Let go.
788

788
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:05,223
(magical swooshing)
789

789
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,917
(thudding)
790

790
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:16,837
(grunting)
791

791
00:50:19,837 --> 00:50:22,087
(grunting)
792

792
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,593
No!
793

793
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:29,926
(exploding)
794

794
00:50:34,806 --> 00:50:38,973
(screaming)
(gasping)
795

795
00:50:42,813 --> 00:50:44,063
- Help us Kyle.
796

796
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,795
(gasping)
797

797
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:54,812
Evie?
798

798
00:51:01,203 --> 00:51:02,036
Evie?
799

799
00:51:09,388 --> 00:51:11,138
Where are you?
- Kyle!
800

800
00:51:12,257 --> 00:51:14,357
- Evie, my god Evie,
801

801
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:15,830
are you alright?
(crying)
802

802
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,163
- I hurt my arm.
803

803
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:22,332
Ow, ow.
804

804
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:28,616
Ow, ow. (crying)
805

805
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,505
Ow my arm hurts, it hurts.
806

806
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,097
- Look we gotta get you out of here.
807

807
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,662
You stay here and I'll go get Mom okay?
808

808
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,303
- No don't go.
809

809
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:42,068
- I have to.
810

810
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:44,597
(swooshing)
811

811
00:51:44,597 --> 00:51:46,196
Evie.
812

812
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,581
Stay back don't come any closer.
813

813
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:50,331
Stay away, stay away.
814

814
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:53,181
Don't come any closer, don't hurt Evie,
815

815
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:55,000
please don't hurt Evie.
816

816
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
- It's alright Kyle, she'll help us.
817

817
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,408
- No don't hurt Evie please.
818

818
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,072
(electric buzzing)
819

819
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:19,563
(magical swooshing)
820

820
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:23,576
- Evie,
821

821
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,375
Evie.
822

822
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,826
- I want to go home, I feel so tired.
823

823
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:35,017
- Don't worry, I'll take you home,
824

824
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:38,100
you'll be okay, don't worry, come on.
825

825
00:52:41,608 --> 00:52:42,441
Evie.
826

826
00:52:43,774 --> 00:52:44,607
Evie,
827

827
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:46,937
Evie?
828

828
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:47,770
- What?
829

829
00:52:48,823 --> 00:52:50,835
- Your fairy friend can help Dad Evie.
830

830
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,568
Make him well.
831

831
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:54,235
- No Kyle she can't.
832

832
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,286
- But your arm, she cured your arm.
833

833
00:52:57,286 --> 00:52:58,401
- This is different,
834

834
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:02,762
only the fairy king has
enough power to save Dad.
835

835
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,345
- Then we have to set him free.
836

836
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,342
- What's wrong?
837

837
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:11,740
- What if Ian's right, I
mean what if they're evil
838

838
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,032
and they start killing again
because we opened up the mine,
839

839
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:16,122
then what?
840

840
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:17,586
- They won't.
841

841
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:21,161
- What if they do, what if they're demons?
842

842
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:22,752
- We gotta take a chance.
843

843
00:53:22,752 --> 00:53:24,085
- Yeah, come on.
844

844
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,202
(laughing)
845

845
00:53:57,063 --> 00:53:57,896
- Kyle?
846

846
00:54:01,006 --> 00:54:03,589
What do you think you're doing?
847

847
00:54:06,457 --> 00:54:09,537
I've been looking for you everywhere,
848

848
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,199
I thought something might
have happened to you.
849

849
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:13,836
Now I don't want you to
ever come down here again
850

850
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:15,024
this mine is dangerous
851

851
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:16,929
and I don't want you anywhere near it.
852

852
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:19,158
- But Mom they could
save Dad if I open it.
853

853
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:19,991
- Who can?
854

854
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:24,374
- You know, Evie's friend the fairy.
855

855
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:27,455
- Kyle?
856

856
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,716
- Really, really Mom.
857

857
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:36,866
- Kyle, I know you're frightened, so am I,
858

858
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:42,982
but I need you to be strong for me Kyle.
859

859
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,903
- Remember E.T., his finger?
860

860
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:51,740
- Oh Kyle.
861

861
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,077
That was just a film, a film.
862

862
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,196
Now look I don't want you
to come down here again,
863

863
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:05,215
it's dangerous down here okay?
864

864
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,298
Promise me Kyle, promise.
865

865
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:12,313
- I promise.
- Okay, come on now.
866

866
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:23,019
(wings flapping)
(dramatic music)
867

867
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,554
(swooshing)
868

868
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:48,304
(dramatic music)
869

869
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:01,519
- I'm sorry, we tried,
870

870
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,635
we promised Grandma we'd help you
871

871
00:56:04,635 --> 00:56:06,885
and we're doing all we can.
872

872
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:11,679
Now Mom won't let us in the mine,
873

873
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:13,053
no one will believe us.
874

874
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:15,827
(gasping)
875

875
00:56:15,827 --> 00:56:18,846
And Grandma's not here to talk to,
876

876
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:20,846
what are we going to do?
877

877
00:56:23,988 --> 00:56:24,821
- Shh.
878

878
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,421
(swooshing)
879

879
00:56:29,421 --> 00:56:33,204
- I don't know what I'm going to do.
880

880
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:36,600
Daddy's very sick, can you help him?
881

881
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,650
(magical swooshing)
882

882
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,975
(barking)
883

883
00:56:39,975 --> 00:56:41,749
(crashing)
884

884
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:45,666
- Well, what, damn, missed
the little blighter.
885

885
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,347
- Don't hurt me, please don't hurt me.
886

886
00:56:49,347 --> 00:56:50,597
- It's alright.
887

887
00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:52,968
- Keep away!
888

888
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:56,542
- It's alright I'm not going
to hurt you, calm down.
889

889
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:59,243
- It's those little devils that I'm after.
890

890
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:01,926
Hey, you shouldn't be down here with them.
891

891
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:05,041
I mean you shouldn't be here
at all, they're not good.
892

892
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:07,379
(swooshing)
(wings flapping)
893

893
00:57:07,379 --> 00:57:08,212
- Keep away.
894

894
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:11,958
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey I
didn't mean to frighten you.
895

895
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,125
(barking)
896

896
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:15,868
Oh.
897

897
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,399
Alright don't be like that,
didn't mean to scare her.
898

898
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:24,232
Come on.
899

899
00:57:30,018 --> 00:57:31,184
- He almost got me.
900

900
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:32,174
- Ian?
901

901
00:57:32,174 --> 00:57:33,917
- What are we gonna do?
902

902
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:37,500
- I'm gonna go into
town and get some help.
903

903
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:41,217
- Can I come too?
904

904
00:57:41,217 --> 00:57:42,884
- No, you stay here.
905

905
00:57:44,684 --> 00:57:47,434
(dramatic music)
906

906
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:54,548
(foreboding music)
907

907
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,581
- Thanks Gladys, see ya.
908

908
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:11,214
- [Kyle] Excuse me.
909

909
00:58:11,214 --> 00:58:12,047
- Yes?
910

910
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:14,101
- I was wondering, do
you have a bulletin board
911

911
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:16,935
where people put there wanted ads?
912

912
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:19,310
- Yes, what is it you need?
913

913
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,531
- Yeah, I live above the Ballaugh house
914

914
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,377
and I was wondering if
somebody could help me
915

915
00:58:23,377 --> 00:58:25,262
work up at the mine.
916

916
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:27,095
- Ballaugh, oh my god.
917

917
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,820
Are you mad?
918

918
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:34,583
Go, get out of my shop, go.
919

919
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:37,583
(suspenseful music)
920

920
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:49,456
- Let's go.
- Let's go, come on.
921

921
00:58:52,973 --> 00:58:54,890
- Excuse me, excuse me.
922

922
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:59,844
I was wondering if you could
help me open up the mine?
923

923
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:01,450
I live up at the Ballaugh house.
924

924
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,434
- No, no way, I've got
no time to waste on ya,
925

925
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:07,441
get out of here, go on, clear out kid.
926

926
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:10,441
(suspenseful music)
927

927
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:31,250
(crashing)
928

928
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,250
(suspenseful music)
929

929
00:59:53,627 --> 00:59:56,044
(chattering)
930

930
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:02,597
- [Kyle] I live up at the Ballaugh house
931

931
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:06,082
and I was wondering if
anybody could help me?
932

932
01:00:06,082 --> 01:00:07,792
I could pay.
933

933
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:10,872
- I told you and your sister to leave,
934

934
01:00:10,872 --> 01:00:12,999
before the monsters get ya.
935

935
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:15,809
- Stay away from Evie
Mister, leave her alone.
936

936
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:16,642
- Or what?
937

937
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:20,384
I told you to leave and you wouldn't
938

938
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,201
and now you father's sick,
939

939
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,665
see he's paying the price
940

940
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:27,440
for meddling in things
he doesn't understand.
941

941
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,565
- You're a liar.
(laughing)
942

942
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:33,098
- Give me another one of those.
943

943
01:00:33,098 --> 01:00:36,500
- There was no call to frighten the kid.
944

944
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,333
- Ah well,
945

945
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:40,638
everyday they're up at that place,
946

946
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:43,011
we're in more danger here.
947

947
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:45,217
I'd just like to see them go
948

948
01:00:45,217 --> 01:00:47,458
for their own good as well as ours.
949

949
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:48,776
- Has it ever occurred to you
950

950
01:00:48,776 --> 01:00:52,548
that we're far too old to
believe all this nonsense?
951

951
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,736
- What are you talking?
952

952
01:00:53,736 --> 01:00:54,986
I've seen them.
953

953
01:00:57,919 --> 01:00:59,661
But what would you know?
954

954
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:02,619
You don't belong here
anymore than they do.
955

955
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:04,893

956

956
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,989
that's what really scares you.
957

957
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:08,860
Anyone who's different,
958

958
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,647
anyone who doesn't fit in with
your limited knowledge world.
959

959
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:17,470
And the rest of you,
you're all just as bad.
960

960
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,053
All of ya, prejudiced,
961

961
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:22,531
it doesn't matter if
they're demons or people,
962

962
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:26,056
if they're different they scare ya,
963

963
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:28,723
and what scares ya, you destroy,
964

964
01:01:29,932 --> 01:01:31,432
even a little kid.
965

965
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:34,199
You're pathetic.
966

966
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:36,949
(dramatic music)
967

967
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:49,206

968

968
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:52,206
(suspenseful music)
969

969
01:02:12,268 --> 01:02:13,647
- [Boy] Come on let's go.
970

970
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,647
(suspenseful music)
971

971
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,132
- Get out of the way.
972

972
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:22,115
(suspenseful music)
973

973
01:02:22,115 --> 01:02:22,948
- Get him.
974

974
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:26,806
(crashing)
975

975
01:02:28,074 --> 01:02:30,345
- [Boy] Come on let's get him.
976

976
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:33,345
(suspenseful music)
977

977
01:02:34,965 --> 01:02:37,215
(quacking)
978

978
01:02:40,063 --> 01:02:43,063
(suspenseful music)
979

979
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,123
Now we got him.
980

980
01:02:50,123 --> 01:02:53,123
(suspenseful music)
981

981
01:03:00,453 --> 01:03:03,421
(crashing)
982

982
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:05,754
(splashing)
983

983
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,373
- My bike.
984

984
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:28,098
(grunting)
985

985
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,783
(crashing)
986

986
01:03:38,783 --> 01:03:39,616
- Kyle?
987

987
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:42,465
Kyle?
988

988
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:45,023
- No one will help us Evie, no one.
989

989
01:03:45,023 --> 01:03:46,519
- Then we'll have to do it ourselves.
990

990
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:47,352
- We can't.
991

991
01:03:47,352 --> 01:03:48,185
- We got to Kyle.
992

992
01:03:48,185 --> 01:03:49,018
- We can't.
993

993
01:03:49,018 --> 01:03:50,750
- We promised Grandma.
994

994
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:54,167
- Hey, hey what's all the shouting about?
995

995
01:03:55,147 --> 01:03:56,064
- Dad, dad,
996

996
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,466
it's true there are goblins in the mine,
997

997
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:04,510
they're trapped, they're really fairies.
998

998
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,418
Can't you see, they can help you Dad,
999

999
01:04:07,418 --> 01:04:10,289
all we've got to do is
open it up and let them go.
1000

1000
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:12,250
- This is ridiculous.
1001

1001
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,366
We should've stomped on this nonsense
1002

1002
01:04:13,366 --> 01:04:14,898
right at the beginning.
1003

1003
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:19,065
- Please Dad believe me, help
me open it, help me save them.
1004

1004
01:04:20,341 --> 01:04:21,864
- Please Daddy.
1005

1005
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:24,088
- No we need to get your father home
1006

1006
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:26,451
where he can get the treatment he needs.
1007

1007
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:27,284
- Nancy.
1008

1008
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:30,210
- Rob I'm not gonna let you do this.
1009

1009
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,814
- I've got to, it's important to them.
1010

1010
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:35,981
Just for a couple of days.
1011

1011
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:43,495
A couple of days.
1012

1012
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:46,245
(dramatic music)
1013

1013
01:04:49,242 --> 01:04:51,409

01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:58,797
Alright there it is.
1016

1016
01:04:58,797 --> 01:05:02,300
Now Kyle take these and hang
them on the tree next to you,
1017

1017
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,383
there you go.
1018

1018
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:09,016
Thanks.
1019

1019
01:05:14,836 --> 01:05:16,362

- Nothing.
1072

1072
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,771
I mean what if we open the mine
1073

1073
01:10:14,771 --> 01:10:17,859
and the goblins are evil, then what?
1074

you just gotta go with your feelings,
1076

1076
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,540
you gotta take a chance
in what you believe in.
1077

1077
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,907
Do you think they're evil?
1078

1078
01:10:26,907 --> 01:10:27,740
- No,
1079

1079
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:30,267

1080

1080

Alright Evie come on, why

Kyle I want you to turn off these lights

1091
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:02,077

- You're pushing me, stop it, quit it.
1099

1099
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:17,811
- Do you think we're making it all up?
1100

1100
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:20,096
Do you thing we're kidding

Look see for yourself, there.
1102

Look at the face of a demon.
1103

01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:25,744
(screaming)
(thunder cracking)
1104

1104
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,781
- You're crazy, just a crazy old man.
1105

1105
01:11:28,781 --> 01:11:32,948
They're not demons, they're
the ones dead aren't they?
1106

1106
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:36,696
If they're so evil how

01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:38,973
how come they're the ones lying there?
1108

1108
01:11:38,973 --> 01:11:40,347
- Hey.
1109

1109
01:11:40,347 --> 01:11:42,535
- You're the ones that are evil not them.
1110

1110
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:45,204
You are, you killed
them, they were trapped,
1111

1111
01:11:45,204 --> 01:11:48,374
all they wanted to do was to
escape and you killed them,
1112

1112
01:11:48,374 --> 01:11:50,874
you, you and your stupid town.
1113

1113
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:55,842
(mysterious music)
1114

1114
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:02,419
You've packed.
1115

1115
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:03,336
- Hey Kyle.
1116

1116
01:12:05,437 --> 01:12:07,724
- Yeah well I'm sorry but we
need to get your father home.
1117

1117
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,262
- We can't go, not now.
1118

1118
01:12:09,262 --> 01:12:10,987
- Hey hey hey hey.
1119

1119
01:12:10,987 --> 01:12:13,883
- Look I'm not going, I'm not giving up.
1120

1120
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:14,967
They can cure you Dad.
1121

1121
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:16,846
- That's enough, we're
leaving and that's final,
1122

1122
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:18,981
I've had it up to here
with these stupid stories.
1123

1123
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:21,038
Your father's sick and we're going home.
1124

1124
01:12:21,038 --> 01:12:22,155
- Nancy.
1125

1125
01:12:22,155 --> 01:12:23,877
- No Rob what do you expect me to do,
1126

1126
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:26,544
just sit here and watch you die?
1127

1127
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:32,129
We're going home.
1128

1128
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:35,807
- You're gonna die and
it's gonna be all my fault,
1129

1129
01:12:35,807 --> 01:12:37,215
only if I could've opened the mine.
1130

1130
01:12:37,215 --> 01:12:41,382
- Hey Kyle, Kyle you did
everything you could do son.
1131

1131
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:45,756
Come here.
1132

1138

1138
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:25,817
I'm just trying to do
what I think is right.
1139

1139
01:13:26,871 --> 01:13:27,704
- I know.
1140

1140
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,373
We have to make plans.
1141

1141
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:40,419
- If only it were true.
1142

1142
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:42,669
If only there were fairies,
1143

1143
01:13:43,974 --> 01:13:45,683
E.T.'s with the power of healing.
1144

1144
01:13:45,683 --> 01:13:46,516
- Ah shh.
1145

1145
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,840
- I don't want to lose you.
1146

1146
01:13:59,456 --> 01:14:01,878
(rain pouring)
1147

1147
01:14:01,878 --> 01:14:03,300

(banging)
1160

1160
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:01,282
- Kyle please.
- No.
1161

1161
01:15:03,424 --> 01:15:05,174
Why, why my Dad, why?
1162

1162
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:12,376
I can save him Mom I can save him.
1163

1163
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:16,543

1164

1164
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:22,178

1165

1165
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,317
(thunder cracking)
1166

1166
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:52,572
(groaning)
1167

1167
01:15:52,572 --> 01:15:55,139
- [Ian] I'll show 'em.
1168

1168
01:15:55,139 --> 01:15:57,714
I'll flood that mine again.
1169

1169
01:15:57,714 --> 01:15:59,344
Oh come on.
1170

1170
01:15:59,344 --> 01:16:02,182
(wheels squeaking)
1171

1171

(shouting)
1188

1188

- I tried to warn ya, you got
the whole place stirred up.
1220

1220
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,750
- Look this is our mine, it's on our land,
1221

1221
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,848
we're gonna do what we want
and nobody's gonna stop us.
1222

1222
01:19:06,848 --> 01:19:07,681
- That's right,
1223

1223
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:10,153
but you gotta understand
how these people feel.
1224

1224
01:19:10,153 --> 01:19:12,970
I haven't got the manpower to
provide you with protection.
1225

1225
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:15,011
- Protection, would you--
1226

1226
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:17,133
- This legend of there's
isn't a joke Mr. Preston,
1227

1227
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:20,556
it's real to them, they know
it's true, they're frightened
1228

1228
01:19:20,556 --> 01:19:22,938
and fear makes people
do things they regret.
1229

1229
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:25,456
- Look I want everybody out of here now.

boy, here boy, good boy.
1265

1265
01:20:50,344 --> 01:20:51,283
- [Rob] Can you hear me?
1266

1266
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:53,650
- Dad!
- I'm coming.
1267

1267
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:54,483
- Dad!
1268

1268
01:20:56,574 --> 01:20:57,407
Tippit.
1269

1269
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:01,395
- Somebody help me, please help me.
1270

1270
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:03,562
- Help him please, please!
1271

1271
01:21:05,353 --> 01:21:07,214
Why don't you help him?
1272

1272
01:21:07,214 --> 01:21:09,156
- I can't believe this,
your stupid superstitions
1273

1273
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:12,648
are going to keep you from
saving a child's life?
1274

1274
01:21:12,648 --> 01:21:14,224
- Let me go for god's sake.
1275

1275
01:21:14,224 --> 01:21:16,450
- Ian let him go.
- There's a kid down there.
1276

1276
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:17,650
- Let him help us.
- It's just a kid.
1277

1277
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:18,483
- No Jim.
1278

1278
01:21:18,483 --> 01:21:20,150
- Kyle!
- Let him go.
1279

1279
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,201
- All you fools, alright
look a tragedy happened here,
1280

1280
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:29,116
it was a long time ago,
1281

1281
01:21:29,116 --> 01:21:32,208
but you're making a worse one right now.
1282

1282
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,668
That's the evil of this
place, not what's down there,
1283

1283
01:21:34,668 --> 01:21:36,668
but here in your hearts.
1284

1284
01:21:38,425 --> 01:21:40,342
Please, please help me.
1285

1285
01:21:44,814 --> 01:21:48,314
- Oh please, please help us.
- Help my dad.
1286

1286
01:21:49,383 --> 01:21:50,633
Please, please.
1287

1287
01:21:54,774 --> 01:21:55,607
Somebody.
1288

1288
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:01,278
Please Ian,
1289

1289
01:22:02,766 --> 01:22:03,648
please?
1290

1290
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,398
(dramatic music)
1291

1291
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,483
- We're coming Kyle just stay there.
1292

1292
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:25,233

Kyle, Kyle!
1297

1297
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:41,979
(dramatic music)
1298

1298
01:22:47,622 --> 01:22:50,569
- [Ian] There's a big one there.
1299

1299
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:51,402
- Kyle!
1300

1300
01:22:53,318 --> 01:22:54,151
Kyle!
1301

1301
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,823
- [Kyle] I'm down here.
1302

1302
01:22:57,823 --> 01:22:58,656
- Careful.
1303

1303
01:22:58,656 --> 01:22:59,573
- Dad help.
1304

1304
01:23:00,464 --> 01:23:01,297
- Kyle.
1305

1305
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:04,077
Watch it, watch it.
1306

1306
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:18,191
Kyle.
1307

1307
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:20,358
- Dad, Dad I'm trapped.
1308

1308
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,018
- [Rob] Kyle!
1309

1309
01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:23,435
Hold on, hold on.
1310

1310
01:23:24,668 --> 01:23:28,085
Let me get this out of the way, watch it.
1311

1311
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:31,590
Hold still, hold still.
1312

1312
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:35,630
Alright, are you alright?
1313

1313
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,580
- My leg it's stuck.
1314

1314
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,098
- Okay hold on, let me see, let me see.
1315

1315
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:44,481
- Look we're gonna have to
move this log very carefully,
1316

1316
01:23:44,481 --> 01:23:45,814
on three.
- Okay.
1317

1317
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:49,204
One, two, three.
1318

1318
01:23:50,396 --> 01:23:51,313
- [Ian] Go.
1319

1319
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:57,901
- [Ian And Jim] One, two.
(crashing)
1320

1320
01:23:57,901 --> 01:24:02,068
(barking)
(coughing)
1321

1321
01:24:05,594 --> 01:24:07,868
- [Kyle] Look Dad, over there.
1322

1322
01:24:07,868 --> 01:24:09,035
- Whoa listen.
1323

1323
01:24:10,118 --> 01:24:11,117
Listen
1324

1324

(distant groaning)
1325

1325
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,793
- What is it?
1326

1326
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:18,107
(distant groaning)
1327

1327
01:24:18,107 --> 01:24:19,843
- [Rob] It's moving.
1328

1328
01:24:19,843 --> 01:24:20,676
- Dad?
1329

1329
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:24,646
- I told you, I told you it's demons.
1330

1330
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:29,692
- Let's get out of here.
1331

1331
01:24:29,692 --> 01:24:32,275
- We gotta get out of here now.
1332

1332
01:24:33,447 --> 01:24:34,280
- [Ian] Tippit.
1333

1333
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,197
(distant groaning)
1334

1334

1336

1336
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:47,097
Tippit.
1337

1337
01:24:49,012 --> 01:24:50,929
- [Man] Demons, demons.
1338

1338
01:24:52,616 --> 01:24:54,783

1342

1342
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:33,312
Kyle.
1343

1343
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,960

(coughing)
1345

1345
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,909

(swooshing)
1347

1347
01:25:46,678 --> 01:25:49,041
- Move it they're coming.
1348

1348
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:51,291
(growling)
1349

1349
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:54,827
They're coming out.
1350

1350
01:25:54,827 --> 01:25:55,660
- Rob.
1351

1351
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,493
- [Kyle and Evie] Dad!
1352

1352
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:57,326
(gasping)
- Daddy.
1353

1353
01:25:57,326 --> 01:25:58,609
- Okay get back, make room for him,
1354

1354
01:25:58,609 --> 01:26:00,887
give him some room please.
1355

1355
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:02,637
Rob speak to me, Rob?
1356

1356
01:26:04,044 --> 01:26:06,474
- Please, please Dad hang on.
1357

1357
01:26:06,474 --> 01:26:08,909
- Oh my goodness look.
1358

1359

1359

- Look.
1360

1360
01:26:28,946 --> 01:26:30,448
- They're going to kill us.
1361

1361
01:26:30,448 --> 01:26:32,896
- No no, that's the
mistake the miners made
1362

1362
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,884
the first time they tried to escape.
1363

1363
01:26:34,884 --> 01:26:36,730
- [Ian] You're wrong
they're going to kill us.
1364

1364
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,788
- They just want to be
free, they won't hurt us.
1365

1365
01:26:39,788 --> 01:26:40,621
- I hope you're right.
1366

1366

(heavy breathing)
1368

1368
01:26:51,917 --> 01:26:54,334
No.
- No Mom, they'll help us.
1369

1369
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:04,708
(resonating)

01:27:21,475 --> 01:27:24,225

1372

1372
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:29,689
- Nancy.
1373

1373
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:32,439
(dramatic music)
1374

1374
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:39,019
(swooshing)
1375

1375
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:43,971
(wings flapping)
1376

1376
01:27:51,077 --> 01:27:54,077
(magical swooshing)
1377

1377
01:28:04,741 --> 01:28:06,597

1378

1378
01:28:06,597 --> 01:28:09,116
(swooshing)
1379

1379
01:28:09,116 --> 01:28:11,866
(dramatic music)
1380

1380
01:28:33,969 --> 01:28:35,302
- Bye Tumbeleen.
1381

1381
01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:41,239
- You did it,
1382

1382
01:28:42,344 --> 01:28:44,427
you did it, they're free.
1383

1383
01:28:46,462 --> 01:28:47,379
- Oh honey.
1384

1384
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:52,729
- [Kyle Narrating] We
stayed on the Isle of Man.
1385

1385
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:55,278
Dad takes me and Evie
fishing a lot with him.
1386

1386
01:28:55,278 --> 01:28:58,554
Tests found no sign of
the sickness in his body.
1387

1387
01:28:58,554 --> 01:29:01,398
Ian turned out to be just
one of Mom's cousins,
1388

1388
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:03,996
seems she has a lot of cousins here.
1389

1389
01:29:03,996 --> 01:29:06,980
I'm glad we freed the
goblins so they can go home.
1390

1390
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,738
So Evie says she still
plays with the fairies
1391

1391
01:29:08,738 --> 01:29:12,125
at the bottom of the garden,
I guess it's nice to know
1392

1392
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:14,882
that there's still a little
magic left in the world.
1393

1393
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:16,332
