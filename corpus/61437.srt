1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,873
First there was darkness.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,396
Then came the strangers.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,836
They were a race as old
as time itself.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
They had mastered
the ultimate technology--

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,393
the ability to alter
physical reality

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,471
by will alone.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,394
They called this ability
''tuning.''

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,232
But they were dying.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,914
Their civilization
was in decline,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,878
and so they abandoned
their world

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,430
seeking a cure
for their own mortality.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,069
Their endless journey brought
them to a small blue world

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,152
in the farthest corner
of the galaxy...

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,470
our world.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,994
Here they thought
they had finally found

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,911
what they had been
searching for.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,350
My name is
Dr Daniel Poe Schreber.

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,112
l am just a man.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,192
l help the strangers
conduct their experiments.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,869
l have betrayed my own kind.

21
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,913
You are confused,
aren't you? Frightened.

22
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,752
That's all right.
l can help you.

23
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,875
Who is this?

24
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,678
l am a doctor.
You must listen to me.

25
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,433
You have lost your memory.
There was an experiment.

26
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,192
Something went wrong.
Your memory was erased.

27
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,474
Do you understand me?

28
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,915
No, l don't. What the hell
is going on here?

29
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,877
There are people coming
for you even as we speak.

30
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,190
You must not
let them find you.

31
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,349
You must leave now.

32
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,079
Hello? Are you there?

33
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,358
Hey, Mr Murdoch.
The automat called.

34
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,908
Said you left your wallet there.

35
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,037
l suggest you retrieve it
since you only paid for 3 weeks,

36
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,111
and they was up

37
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,636
l've been here 3 weeks?

38
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,314
lt's right there in
black and white, Mr Murdoch.

39
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,231
Day and date.

40
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,278
We make our books like our beds,
all neat and tidy.

41
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,669
l'll take care of it
when l get back.

42
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,069
See that you do. Only thing
that makes you a guest

43
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,390
in this joint, pal,
is cash on the barrelhead.

44
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,068
House rules.

45
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,599
Mr Murdoch, yes, where is he?

46
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,150
He just left not 5 minutes ago.

47
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,316
Sleep now.

48
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,552
When the rumba rhythms
start to play

49
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,358
Dance with me

50
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,113
Make me sway

51
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,079
Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore

52
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,310
Hold me close

53
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,312
Sway me more

54
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,234
Like a flower
bending in the breeze

55
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,709
Bend with me

56
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,234
Sway with ease

57
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,074
When we dance,
you have a way with me

58
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,594
Stay with me

59
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Sway with me

60
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,311
Hey, sweetie!

61
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,630
He said he was your
husband's doctor.

62
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,995
He wanted to speak with you.

63
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,394
Excuse me.

64
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,629
Dr...

65
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,632
Schreber.
Please, won't you come in?

66
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,631
You must be Emma Murdoch.

67
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,235
Thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice.

68
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,151
What is this?

69
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,798
A rather crude experiment

70
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,598
designed to further my studies.

71
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,908
l don't understand.

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,956
You say you're
my husband's doctor,

73
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,759
but he never
mentioned you to me.

74
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,193
The truth is, Mrs Murdoch,

75
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,430
John has been coming to
see me for quite some time.

76
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,195
He had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal

77
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,078
stemming from your
marital difficulties.

78
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,479
John told you what happened?

79
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,198
Yes.

80
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,589
When was the last time
that you saw him?

81
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,908
3 weeks ago.

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,549
He packed a suitcase.
He was very angry at me.

83
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,473
l understand how difficult
this must be for you.

84
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,949
But for John's sake,
l would like you

85
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,359
to think of me
as your friend, Emma.

86
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,149
lt appears John has suffered
a psychotic break.

87
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,878
Complete memory loss.

88
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,279
You can't be serious.

89
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,193
Oh, but l am.
He may be delusional.

90
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,794
Even violent.

91
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,917
lf he were to contact you,
you must call me immediately.

92
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,958
Wherever your husband is,
he is searching...

93
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,873
for himself.

94
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,476
Good evening, Mr Murdoch.

95
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,074
lt is Mr Murdoch, isn't it?

96
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,869
Mr--was it
''J''-something--Murdoch?

97
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,835
J. Murdoch.

98
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,310
What's your name? Justin? Jerry?

99
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,790
No.

100
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,836
My name's Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.

101
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,148
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?

102
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,879
Hi. Jack Murdoch.

103
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,512
Hi.

104
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,191
Gotta get a grip on myself.

105
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,272
l told the guy
cash on the barrelhead.

106
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,511
l said, ''Listen,

107
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
Upstairs, sir, room 614.

108
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,154
Another call girl.

109
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,800
''J. Murdoch.''

110
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,553
Evening, Husselbeck.

111
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,789
lnspector Bumstead.

112
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,314
Your lace is untied.

113
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,958
Sir.

114
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,478
Am l glad you're here, sir.

115
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,120
They say Detective Walenski's
got the heebie-jeebies.

116
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,236
Just take what they
give me, Husselbeck.

117
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,556
Come on. l ain't got
any ltalian sausages.

118
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,595
l'm running out of plates.

119
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,152
Thanks a lot.

120
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,514
Excuse me.

121
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,510
Hello.

122
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,033
Oh, it's you.

123
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,678
You left your wallet here,
buddy.

124
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,670
Oh, when did l do that?

125
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,795
When you was last here.

126
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,835
When was that?

127
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,876
When you left your wallet.

128
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,552
You expect me to remember?

129
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,878
Hello.

130
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,915
Excuse me.

131
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,956
No, no, seriously.

132
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,239
Alleged?

133
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,714
- Where you headed, chief?
- Home.

134
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,994
And where's home?

135
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,799
Haven't you mugs got
anything better to do?

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,871
Well, l'm just trying
to do my job, May.

137
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,951
There's a killer out there,
in case you hadn't noticed.

138
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,393
Maybe you should be
out looking for him

139
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,469
instead of cooling
your heels, huh?

140
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,234
Aw, go on, get out of here.

141
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,316
Come on.

142
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,030
What's that make so far,
Husselbeck?

143
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,269
6 hookers in all?

144
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,793
l believe so, sir.

145
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,518
Give the man an ''A'' for effort.

146
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,836
So, Husselbeck,

147
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,196
what kind of killer
do you think stops

148
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,192
to save a dying fish?

149
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,190
You've got me, sir.

150
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,271
Bumstead, what took you?

151
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,271
This killer's been
running circles around us,

152
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,429
thanks to Walenski.

153
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,112
With all due respect,
Chief lnspector,

154
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,519
l've known Eddie a long time.

155
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,113
He's a good cop.

156
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,428
Whatever kind of cop
Walenski once was,

157
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,273
he let drift a long time ago.

158
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,918
Let me talk to Bumstead!

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,673
Come on, hold it!

160
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,990
Frank, Frank!

161
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,229
Whoa!

162
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,719
Get his arm!

163
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,028
On your feet.

164
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,712
There's no way out!

165
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,679
God, can you see?!

166
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,473
Let me go, let me go!

167
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,788
l'm not gonna hurt you.

168
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,472
What was that?

169
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,039
Walenski.

170
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,957
l'm being punished
for my sins, right?

171
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,349
What did l ever do
to inherit this?

172
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,475
Where do you begin?

173
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,516
Everything Detective Walenski

174
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,431
committed to paper
should be here.

175
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,593
The only thing that should
be committed is Walenski.

176
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,118
Nothing like a little
healthy paranoia.

177
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,356
lnspector Bumstead.

178
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,158
l came here to file
a missing persons report

179
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,832
for my husband.

180
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,559
Take it to the front desk.

181
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,232
They told me to come see you.

182
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,155
His name's John Murdoch.

183
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,478
Do these names
mean anything to you?

184
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,709
No. Who are these women?

185
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,189
Why are you looking
for my husband?

186
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,431
Are you going to accuse him
of something?

187
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,794
Maybe murder.

188
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,835
Whose murder?

189
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,355
Which one?

190
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,829
All of them.

191
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,273
Mrs Murdoch,

192
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,920
l'm sorry. l didn't
mean to alarm you.

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,069
l'm sorry that l came.

194
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,957
Just both made a mistake.

195
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,077
Please, if you'll just
give me half a second.

196
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,430
Have we met before?

197
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,317
lf we did,

198
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,879
l hope you're still breathing.

199
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,359
What's your name, honey?

200
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,275
John.

201
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,794
Well,
that's an appropriate name.

202
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,552
Yeah.

203
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,713
l was just thinking.

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,276
What you do...

205
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,478
seems kind of dangerous...

206
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,471
right now.

207
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,118
How do you know
l'm not the killer?

208
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,272
You don't seem like
the killer type. Why?

209
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,954
You feeling any urges
l should know about?

210
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,558
Aw, shoot.

211
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,313
So it seems you've discovered
your unpleasant nature.

212
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,435
Who are you?

213
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,069
We might ask
the same question, yes?

214
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,515
Sleep now.

215
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,359
Aah!

216
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,917
He can tune.

217
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,678
What is to be done?

218
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,557
This man is dangerous.

219
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,756
lt is said he is able to tune.

220
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,239
lmpossible.

221
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,914
We have seen it
with our own eyes.

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,230
On occasion, the imprinting
does not take.

223
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,151
They behave erratically
when they awaken.

224
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,835
We find them wandering
like lost children.

225
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,912
But this one was different, yes?

226
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,513
What has the doctor
to say about this?

227
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,431
He has failed to report in.

228
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,794
And Mr Quick?

229
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,472
No more Mr Quick.

230
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,394
Mr Quick, dead, yes.

231
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,790
Poor, poor Mr Quick.

232
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,633
Mr Book-- does he know?

233
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,632
Should we not know, Mr Hand?

234
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,950
We had hoped to learn more

235
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,314
before sharing with you.

236
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,153
We can know nothing
until we possess him.

237
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,993
We must have this man.

238
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,117
My brand, l hope.

239
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,229
John.

240
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,033
l've been so worried about you.

241
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,391
Are you punishing me?

242
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,311
You know, if disappearing
is your way of punishing me,

243
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,515
l don't appreciate it.

244
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,989
l don't know what
you're talking about.

245
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,953
l found these keys in my pocket,

246
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,713
so l assume l live here.

247
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,438
You supposed to be my wife?

248
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,397
Supposed to be?

249
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,391
John.

250
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,630
You really...

251
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,756
don't know who l am, do you?

252
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,159
Your doctor called me.

253
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,753
He was worried
this might happen.

254
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,750
My doctor?

255
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,230
Yeah. He, uh...

256
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,197
he gave me his card.

257
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,714
He's desperate to find you.

258
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,075
Schreber.

259
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,793
l feel like l'm living out
someone else's nightmare.

260
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,393
What happened to me?

261
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,993
Why was l seeing a doctor?

262
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,799
l had an affair.

263
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,314
You were angry at me.

264
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,433
Closing time.

265
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,239
The pool is now closed.

266
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,475
Dr Schreber.

267
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,518
How most unfortunate it is

268
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,478
that we were forced
to seek you out here.

269
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,317
You know how uncomfortable
we find all this moisture.

270
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,310
l'm sorry. l--

271
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,356
Failed to report in, yes?

272
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,395
l was frightened.

273
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,913
l have a weak heart, you know.

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,073
Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

275
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,276
We found this in his hotel room.

276
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,069
Must we reproduce
Mr Murdoch's memories again?

277
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,388
l tried to imprint him,
but he woke up.

278
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,959
He knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

279
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,109
l tried to stop him.

280
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,235
He has no memories, then?

281
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,309
Only fragments.

282
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,470
The procedure,
it was interrupted.

283
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,109
l guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

284
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,872
You have had strays before,
right?

285
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,712
This is no stray, Doctor.

286
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,279
This one can tune.

287
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,588
But that's impossible.

288
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,113
l thought only you
had that ability.

289
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,509
You will process
another template

290
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,477
of the subject's
memories, yes?

291
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,994
Of course.
l'll imprint him again.

292
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,675
No. We require them
for a quite different purpose.

293
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,354
lt's almost midnight,
Dr Schreber.

294
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,829
We'll talk again
after tonight's tuning,

295
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,956
but no more delays, yes?

296
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,750
No more inconsistencies
in your behaviour.

297
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,593
The police are looking for you.

298
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,511
l know. l saw the papers.

299
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,310
''Killer Stalks
City's Streetwalkers.''

300
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,958
l was with one of those women

301
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,234
before l came here tonight.

302
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,517
l don't understand.

303
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,828
l met her outside an automat.

304
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,753
l guess l wanted to test myself.

305
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,513
l wanted to know
if l had it in me

306
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,510
to do those things.

307
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,272
Maybe l have lost my mind,

308
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,715
but whoever l am, l'm still me,

309
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,199
and l'm not a killer.

310
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,192
l believe you.

311
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,956
You do?

312
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,479
The car outside,

313
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,709
the one you arrived in.

314
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,112
lt's a cop.
He dropped me off here.

315
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,589
l didn't know he was still here.

316
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,635
John.

317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,274
Hold it right there, mister!

318
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,710
Wait. You have the wrong man.

319
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,789
Stand aside, will you, please?

320
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,199
l didn't kill anyone.

321
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,589
Right now all you are
is a suspect.

322
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,352
Turn yourself in.

323
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,192
l'll listen to whatever
you have to say.

324
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,633
You're not gonna believe
what l have to say.

325
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,790
Try me.

326
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,916
There's someone after me.

327
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,433
There's this group of men.

328
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,953
They want me dead.

329
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,792
And l don't even know--

330
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,154
They're not even--

331
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,435
Yeah, who's gonna
listen to a madman?

332
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,635
Stand aside, Mrs Murdoch.

333
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,755
Run!

334
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,468
No one ever listens to me.

335
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,997
Murdoch, stop!

336
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,075
Murdoch!

337
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,828
How much further?

338
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,353
We're almost there, buddy.

339
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,118
Hey, you happen to know
the way to Shell Beach?

340
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,428
You're kidding.

341
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,988
Me and the missus spent
our honeymoon there.

342
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,594
All you gotta do is take
Main Street West to...

343
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,878
Or is it the cross...

344
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,509
You know, that's funny.
l can't seem to remember

345
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,636
if it's Main Street West
or the cross-town.

346
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,315
l'm sorry, lnspector,

347
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,436
l cannot be
of more assistance,

348
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,238
but l am running late
for an appointment.

349
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,470
Well, l appreciate
your taking the time.

350
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,636
There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

351
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,870
l've met quite a few murderers

352
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,269
in the course of my work.

353
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,794
Murdoch doesn't
strike me as one.

354
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,030
Perhaps you are not accustomed

355
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,348
to digging deep enough.

356
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,591
l do know when someone
is lying to me, Doctor.

357
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,908
lnspector, judging personalities

358
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,877
happens to be my business.

359
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,678
Well, maybe you could
give me a few pointers.

360
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,637
Certainly.

361
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,517
Let's take you, for instance.

362
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,799
You are a fastidious man,
driven. Consumed by details.

363
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,836
l would say your life

364
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,114
is rather lonely.

365
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,110
Good evening, lnspector.

366
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,713
l really must be going.

367
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,029
- Come in.
- Kate.

368
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,950
How is he?

369
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,110
The same.

370
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,872
Walenski.

371
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,279
lt's me, Frank.

372
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,794
Come in, Frank.

373
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,518
Close the door.

374
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,790
l've been looking through
some of your old reports.

375
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,838
lt's an interesting case.

376
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,675
The kind that can make
a man's career...

377
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,239
or break it.

378
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,993
Yeah, l was on that case.

379
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,433
And then what?

380
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,192
What happened then, Eddie?

381
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,475
Nothing happened, Frank.

382
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,154
l've just been spending time
on the subway,

383
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,912
riding in circles.

384
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,877
Thinking in circles.

385
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,757
There's no way out.

386
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,190
l've been over every
inch of this city.

387
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,718
You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

388
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,279
She's not my wife.

389
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,191
l don't know who she is.

390
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,669
l don't know who any of us are.

391
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,557
What makes you say that?

392
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,518
Do you think about
the past much, Frank?

393
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,999
As much as the next guy.

394
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,959
See, l've been trying
to remember things--

395
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,349
clearly remember things
from my past.

396
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,635
But the more
l try to think back,

397
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,631
the more it all
starts to unravel.

398
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,790
None of it seems real.

399
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,270
lt's like l've just been
dreaming this life,

400
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,271
and when l finally wake up,

401
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,873
l'll be somebody else.

402
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,234
Somebody totally different.

403
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,468
You saw something,
didn't you, Eddie?

404
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,552
Something to do with the case.

405
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,517
There is no case.

406
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,397
There never was!

407
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,869
lt's all just a big joke!

408
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,518
lt's a joke!

409
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,312
Tonight's requirements

410
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,271
are 12 family photo albums,

411
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,670
9 personal diaries,

412
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,398
17 love letters,

413
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,392
assorted childhood photographs,

414
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,993
26 wallets,

415
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,514
lDs, and social
security cards.

416
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,397
These do bring back memories.

417
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,750
This one is still warm.

418
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,671
What is it?

419
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,638
The recollections
of a great lover?

420
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,553
A catalogue of conquests?

421
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,153
We will soon find out.

422
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,550
You wouldn't appreciate that,
would you,

423
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,915
Mr Whatever your name is?

424
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,039
Not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand.

425
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,951
Let's see.

426
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,749
A touch of unhappy childhood.

427
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,198
Ahh.

428
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,030
A dash of teenage rebellion.

429
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,709
And last, but not least,

430
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,189
a tragic death in the family.

431
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,599
Doctor.

432
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,709
Mr Book.

433
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,798
Aah!

434
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,996
Why does Murdoch not sleep

435
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,911
during the tuning
as the others do?

436
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,194
l don't know.

437
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,397
Maybe he's a step up
the evolutionary ladder.

438
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,153
A freak of nature.
He's adapting to survive.

439
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,231
What do you expect?
Weren't you looking

440
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,514
for the human soul?

441
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,555
That's the purpose

442
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,914
of your little zoo, isn't it?

443
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,558
That's why you keep
changing people

444
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,232
and things around every night.

445
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,231
Maybe you have finally found

446
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,355
what you are looking for,

447
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,237
and it's going
to bite you on your--

448
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,679
lt requires several
of your lifetimes

449
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,671
to master our gifts.

450
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,512
The idea that a simple man

451
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,397
could develop
the ability to tune--

452
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,549
ls absurd, l know,

453
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,915
but what other
explanation is there?

454
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,557
lt is time.

455
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,037
Shut it down.

456
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,958
Frederickson says he'll take me

457
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,871
off the damn night shift soon.

458
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,791
Well, it's about time, dear.

459
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,389
Hello?

460
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,158
Hello?!

461
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,555
Wake up.

462
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,595
Hey!

463
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,155
Wake up!

464
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,117
Wake up!

465
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,472
Wake up!

466
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,593
Hello?!

467
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,672
Can anybody hear me?!

468
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,156
Let the tuning commence.

469
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,073
The Goodwins. Jeremy, Sylvia,

470
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,310
Jane and little Matthew.

471
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,956
Jane and little Matthew.

472
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,115
The rich get richer.

473
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,553
Probably have maid's quarters

474
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,153
before the night is through.

475
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,552
Dr Schreber, l presume.

476
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,153
lt's you.

477
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,468
Hey, come on.

478
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,630
That's no way to greet
a patient, Doctor.

479
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,278
lf that's what you are,
huh, Doctor?

480
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,793
Mr Murdoch, please--

481
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,552
What is happening here?
Why is everyone asleep?

482
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,835
Shh. Please keep
your voice down.

483
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,955
Why can't l remember anything?

484
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,314
What have you done to me?

485
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,310
Nothing, nothing.

486
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,594
Please, l want to help you.

487
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,874
We can't talk here.

488
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,916
lt is not safe.
lf they see us together--

489
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,558
l don't care.
l want some answers.

490
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,550
l want some answers now!

491
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,755
Who are they?

492
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,671
Why are they trying to kill me?

493
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,795
Answer me!

494
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,235
My God.

495
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,788
You really can do it.

496
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,108
l did that?

497
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,794
Listen to me, John.
You have their power.

498
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,074
You can make things happen
by will alone.

499
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,752
They call it tuning.

500
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,717
That is how they make
the buildings change.

501
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,030
Just now you acted out of
self-defence. A reflex.

502
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,350
But l can teach you to control
your power consciously.

503
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,839
Let me help you, John.

504
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,148
Together we can stop them.

505
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,673
We can take the city back.

506
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,518
My glasses.

507
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,795
My glasses, please.

508
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,749
He made a terrible
impression for the firm,

509
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,149
lollygagging around as he did.

510
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,468
So l simply told Frederickson

511
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,959
l was going to have
to let him go.

512
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,508
And well you should have,
darling.

513
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,874
He attacked me.

514
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,235
l don't know where he has gone.

515
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,992
Come, Dr Schreber.

516
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,991
We have much to do.

517
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,069
Yes?

518
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,479
Yes.

519
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,076
They say that you're
a run-around lover

520
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,799
Though you say

521
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,635
lt isn't so

522
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:52,513
But if you put me down
for another

523
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,477
l'll know

524
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,872
Believe me, l'll know

525
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,510
Tonight's experiment
shall be conducted

526
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,959
in the following locations.

527
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,749
The first subject
shall be imprinted here

528
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,273
on Avenue M.

529
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,759
Mr Book, there is a problem.

530
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,273
There is no Avenue M.

531
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,078
We were unable to complete it.

532
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,789
During the last tuning, we
detected a lack of control.

533
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,269
An opposing influence
on the machines?

534
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,355
Then this man Murdoch

535
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,510
is more powerful
than we thought.

536
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,636
He's becoming like us.

537
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,235
So we must become like him.

538
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,390
The good doctor
has done as we asked.

539
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,631
The Life and Times
of John Murdoch,

540
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,199
Volume 2.

541
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,118
We must not do this.

542
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,636
Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

543
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,188
How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

544
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,510
Everywhere he goes,

545
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,477
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us.

546
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,233
And as he follows the clues,

547
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,630
so shall we follow the memories.

548
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,153
But to imprint one of us.

549
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,913
Failure has always resulted.

550
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,276
What Mr Hand proposes
is our only option.

551
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,759
lmprint.

552
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,751
This may sting a bit.

553
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,436
ls it done?

554
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,829
Oh, yes, Mr Book.

555
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,072
l have John Murdoch...in mind.

556
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,593
''Johnny...

557
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,559
''l found this postcard
among your mother's things.

558
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,790
''Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

559
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,632
''Stop by sometime.

560
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,073
''We'll see if we
can't hook ourselves

561
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,718
''another mermaid.

562
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,552
Love to Emma. Karl.''

563
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,675
Karl.

564
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,553
Karl Harris.

565
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,992
Harris.

566
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,718
Harris.

567
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,352
''Harris Karl.''

568
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,752
Excuse me. Can you tell
me the way to Avenue C?

569
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,558
Try the subway.

570
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,475
You got a problem, pal?

571
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,437
You, uh, been working here long?

572
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,431
25 years,

573
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,476
no days off for good behaviour.

574
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,712
We're looking for John Murdoch.

575
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,235
Shhhh.

576
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,311
She knows nothing, Mr Hand.

577
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,436
A dead end, yes, Mr Wall.

578
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,829
We thought his imprint would
allow us to track him, yes,

579
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,309
but instead we have
been brought here.

580
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,879
This is irrational.

581
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,996
lnstincts are irrational,
Mr Wall,

582
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,550
and we must follow
where they lead, yes.

583
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,598
Mr Sleep suggests he
may go to places familiar,

584
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,749
his job.

585
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,751
He does not care about our job.

586
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,513
lndulge us, Mr Hand.

587
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,192
lf you were Murdoch--

588
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,190
Yes...

589
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,111
if...

590
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,519
l were Murdoch...

591
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,275
l would remember

592
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,430
how my wife had hurt me

593
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,397
by sleeping with another man.

594
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,274
And then...

595
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,430
l would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

596
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,239
Leave me alone with her.

597
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,878
There's work to be done.

598
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,435
All change, platform 3.

599
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,159
Platform 3, all change.

600
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,992
All change? Excuse me.

601
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,149
How do l get
to the end of the line?

602
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,753
You want the express.

603
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,392
No trains leave on platform 7.

604
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,674
You want platform 2.

605
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,715
Hey!

606
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,233
How come that train didn't stop?

607
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,548
That's the express.

608
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,752
There's no way out, you know?

609
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,478
You can't get out of the city.

610
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,549
Believe me, l've tried.

611
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,313
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

612
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,152
The one they've been
looking for.

613
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,515
You're not a killer.
They set you up

614
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,272
with a fake identity,

615
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,713
like everyone else
in this place.

616
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,710
Who are you?

617
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,313
Used to be a cop.

618
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,356
At least, in this life, l was.

619
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,874
They steal people's
memories, you know?

620
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,996
Then they swap them around
between us.

621
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,035
l've seen them do it.

622
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,951
Back and forth,
back and forth,

623
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,837
till no one knows
who they are anymore.

624
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,114
How do you know all this?

625
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,792
Once in a while,
one of us wakes up

626
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,235
while they're changing things.

627
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,390
lt's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

628
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,277
lt happened to me.

629
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,157
They'll come looking
for you, Murdoch.

630
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,833
Just like they'll
come looking for me.

631
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,911
But that's OK.

632
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,228
l figured a way out.

633
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,755
They were here.

634
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,112
Last night.

635
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,156
This was to be his home.

636
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,914
Ah.

637
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,672
That was when we loved her.

638
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,512
This is all well and good,
Mr Hand,

639
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,830
but we require
a more practical link

640
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,751
to his present whereabouts.

641
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,589
Yes.

642
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,990
And l know where to find her.

643
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,353
We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

644
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,429
l'm sorry?

645
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,795
To be able to revisit
those places

646
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,552
which have meant
so very much to us.

647
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,393
l thought it was more
that we were haunted by them.

648
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,391
Perhaps.

649
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,710
There used to be a ferry
when l was a boy,

650
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,552
biggest thing you ever saw.

651
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,598
Lit up like a floating
birthday cake.

652
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,070
That's just what my husband
once said to me

653
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,878
on this very spot.

654
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,838
Where is
your husband now?

655
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,797
l wish l knew.

656
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,996
What brings you here?

657
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,833
l met my wife at this place.

658
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,592
lt's where
l first met my husband.

659
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,716
Small world.

660
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,913
Hello?

661
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,399
Hello?

662
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,119
Aah!

663
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,274
What are you doing here?

664
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,112
l've been following you.

665
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,678
Hold it right there!

666
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,394
Johnny?

667
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,674
Johnny?

668
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,468
lt's been so damn long,

669
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,788
l thought you'd forgotten

670
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,199
your uncle Karl.

671
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,352
You son of a gun!
Ha ha ha ha!

672
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,476
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

673
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,993
Uncle Karl?

674
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,795
Wait.

675
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,393
ls that me?

676
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,595
Yeah.

677
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,392
Shell Beach is where l grew up?

678
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,435
That's what l said.

679
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,715
Shell Beach, your hometown.

680
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,837
l need to get there, Karl.
How do l get there?

681
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,353
l don't know.

682
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,032
l haven't been there in years.

683
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,439
Come on. You must remember.

684
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,317
You gotta have some idea.

685
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,310
Come on!

686
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,152
Uh, sorry, Johnny.

687
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,439
The old cracker barrel
ain't what it used to be.

688
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,396
So bright there.

689
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,630
Brighter times, l guess.

690
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,269
You were always scribbling
in that damn book.

691
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,635
That's me and your pa. Ha!

692
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,790
What a couple of handsome fools.

693
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,074
What happened to my parents?

694
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,229
Where are they now?

695
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,117
They're dead, Johnny.

696
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,519
They died

697
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,511
when their house burned down.

698
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,113
l looked after you.

699
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,431
You don't remember that, really?

700
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,030
What's that?

701
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,519
Huh?

702
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,715
What is that?

703
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,873
What's the scar?

704
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,474
You burnt your arm
pretty bad in the fire.

705
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,074
What does it mean, Johnny?

706
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,957
lt means these are all lies!

707
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,556
My husband told me
he'd been here.

708
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,108
He told me he wanted
to test himself,

709
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,509
see if he was...

710
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,431
capable of...

711
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,551
l wanted to talk to her.

712
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,915
l thought maybe she
could help me find him.

713
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,390
Stay here. l'm gonna
call the station.

714
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,359
Stay back, miss.

715
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,235
lt's beautiful.

716
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,393
lt was a gift from my mother.

717
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,199
She died recently.

718
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,475
l keep it with me
to remind me of her.

719
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,794
l'm sorry.

720
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,150
lt's a funny thing, though.

721
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,470
l can't remember
when she gave it to me.

722
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,796
How do you think l could
forget a thing like that?

723
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,633
What's happening,
lnspector?

724
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,234
l'm not sure l know anymore.

725
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,112
l left your old room
like it was.

726
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,236
You can sleep here tonight, huh?

727
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,550
Glad to have you back, Johnny,

728
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,119
even if it is for just a night.

729
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,110
Karl.

730
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,189
Huh?

731
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,429
ls that the right time?

732
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,034
Why, sure. That clock's
kept perfect time

733
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,030
since l bought it.

734
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,951
A.m. or p.m.?

735
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,394
What do you think, Johnny?

736
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,152
l don't understand.
How can it be night already?

737
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,878
What happened to the day?
How'd l miss it?

738
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,679
You're tired.
Anything's possible.

739
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,159
Look, uh...

740
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,639
get some sleep. We'll...

741
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,439
straighten all this out
tomorrow.

742
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,273
''Guide to Shell Beach
by Johnny Murdoch.''

743
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,035
Oh, come on.

744
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,470
Hello?

745
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,959
Emma, he's here.

746
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,110
He's acting mighty peculiar.

747
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,111
l know. He's not himself.

748
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,918
Keep him there,
and l'll be right over.

749
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,910
l'll try.

750
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,274
Thanks, Karl. Bye.

751
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,789
Johnny...

752
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,677
l can't promise
anything, Mrs Murdoch.

753
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,079
We just have to
play it as it comes.

754
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,752
Johnny, we...

755
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,398
we just wanted to help. Ha.

756
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,910
Karl.

757
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,228
Uncle Karl.

758
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,550
Johnny, if you're
in some kind of trouble,

759
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,108
well, maybe we
could do something.

760
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,668
Haven't seen you in so long.

761
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,478
Yes.

762
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,599
Mr Murdoch...

763
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,309
you've been the cause
of much distress.

764
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,191
Start talking.

765
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,429
There's no need for this.

766
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,873
There's no escape.

767
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,916
The city's ours. We made it.

768
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,228
What are you talking about?

769
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,357
We fashioned this city
on stolen memories,

770
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,317
different eras, different pasts,

771
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,231
all rolled into one.

772
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,550
Each night, we revise it,
refine it

773
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,993
in order to learn.

774
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,115
Learn what?

775
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,713
About you, Mr Murdoch,

776
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,030
you and your fellow inhabitants,

777
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,792
what makes you human.

778
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,154
Why?!

779
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,549
We need to be like you.

780
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,313
l understand you now,
Mr Murdoch.

781
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,356
l remember that
which you do not,

782
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,714
what you've been missing.

783
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,392
The ocean, yes...

784
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,915
Running along the waves
as a child,

785
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,355
meeting Emma at the river,

786
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,398
that first kiss that followed.

787
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,390
What are you?

788
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,311
You've seen what we are.

789
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,073
We use your dead as vessels.

790
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,395
Aah!

791
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,315
Get in!

792
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,635
What about her?
Ring any bells?

793
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,869
She was alive when l left her.

794
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,949
What about this?

795
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,951
This is nothing. l...

796
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,270
lt must mean something,
all those pictures.

797
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,316
What pictures?

798
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,435
l don't understand this.

799
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,158
Stop playing games
with me, Murdoch!

800
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,150
Stop telling me lies!

801
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,514
l am not telling you lies!

802
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,510
Help me out here.

803
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,919
Make me understand.

804
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,910
l have this jigsaw puzzle

805
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,910
in front of my face,

806
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,910
and every time l try

807
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,955
to rearrange the pieces,

808
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,995
it still doesn't make any sense.

809
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,195
You think it makes sense to me?

810
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,157
l'm as much in the dark
here as you are.

811
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,992
You let me ask you a question?

812
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,229
You heard of a place
called Shell Beach?

813
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,230
Sure.

814
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,230
Know how to get there?

815
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,230
Yeah.

816
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,309
Can you tell me?

817
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,119
Right. You just, uh...

818
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,077
You go to the...

819
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,149
Where? Where do you go?

820
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,231
Just give me a second, will ya?

821
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,998
You can't remember, can you?

822
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,719
You think that's kind of odd?

823
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,755
Hmm?

824
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,637
Wait.

825
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,869
l got a better one for you.

826
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,234
When was the last time

827
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,993
you remember doing
something during the day?

828
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,069
What do you mean?

829
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,310
l just mean... during the day.

830
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,628
Ha. Daylight.

831
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,836
When was the last time
you remember seeing it?

832
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,990
And l'm not talking
about some distant,

833
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,433
half-forgotten
childhood memory.

834
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,478
l mean like yesterday?
Last week? When?

835
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,869
Can you come up
with a single memory?

836
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,599
You can't, can you?

837
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,752
You know something?
l don't think the sun even...

838
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,955
exists...

839
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,359
in this place.

840
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,954
'Cause l've been up for
hours and hours and hours,

841
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,439
and the night
never ends here.

842
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,078
That is crazy.

843
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,479
You're damn right this is crazy.

844
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,028
Listen to me, Bumstead.
lt's not just me.

845
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,076
lt's all of us.

846
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,513
They're doing something
to all of us.

847
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,113
Shut up. l've heard enough.

848
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,110
Please listen.

849
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,952
Shut up! Shut up!

850
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,557
There has to be an explanation

851
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,914
for this somewhere.

852
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,034
Explain this.

853
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,155
John, l'm so sorry.

854
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,674
l never meant to hurt you, John,

855
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,909
and l did it, and l
don't know why l did it.

856
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,877
l wish l could take it all back.

857
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,279
No. Emma...

858
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,475
you didn't do it.

859
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,120
This...affair of yours,
whatever it is,

860
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,633
the thing you're
supposed to have done,

861
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,438
you didn't do it. l don't
believe it ever happened.

862
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,919
What do you mean?

863
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,275
l know this is
gonna sound crazy,

864
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,193
but what if we never
knew each other before now?

865
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,430
What if the first time
we ever met

866
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,999
was last night

867
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,116
in your-- in our apartment,

868
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,953
and everything you remember...

869
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,553
and everything that
l'm supposed to remember

870
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,709
never really happened?

871
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,314
Someone just wants us
to think it did.

872
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,039
But how can that be true?

873
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,238
l so vividly
remember meeting you.

874
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,392
l remember falling
in love with you.

875
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,199
l remember losing you.

876
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,033
No, wait, wait.

877
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,111
Please, just...

878
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,155
just one more minute.

879
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,394
l love you, John.

880
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,793
You can't fake
something like that.

881
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,916
No, you can't.

882
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,831
lnspector? Sir?

883
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,515
Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

884
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,556
l, um...

885
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,312
kind of thought you should know.

886
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,273
Oh, and...

887
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,510
the chief wanted to see you.

888
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,555
Sir...

889
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,311
l knew you'd track
the killer down, sir.

890
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,476
Um...

891
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,515
sir...

892
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,315
Shoelace.

893
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,195
How can we help you, sir?

894
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,350
You can sleep.

895
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,350
Gentlemen--

896
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,998
Sleep. Sleep.

897
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,629
Evening, sir.

898
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,315
Bumstead.

899
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,190
l want to be the first
to congratulate you

900
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,713
about the case.

901
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,348
Take us...

902
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,714
to Murdoch.

903
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,755
Sleep.

904
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,639
Dr Schreber.

905
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,512
l knew you'd
come eventually.

906
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,635
Don't you think it's about time

907
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,073
you started giving
me some answers?

908
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,230
Yes. Yes, of course.

909
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,958
Won't you please sit down?

910
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,916
l--l come here quite often.

911
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,035
lt's one of the few places

912
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,155
l'm allowed a moment's peace.

913
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,879
You--you see,
they have an aversion

914
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,632
to--to water.

915
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,438
One could almost
call it a phobia.

916
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,238
Who are they?

917
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,594
What do they want from me?

918
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,079
Right.

919
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,116
Well, for now, let's just say...

920
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,668
that you were the subject
of their experiment.

921
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,830
W-we all are.

922
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,229
l'm sorry about this.
l truly am.

923
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,673
But we do not have much time,

924
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,749
and l cannot afford the luxury

925
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,239
of doing this the right way.

926
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,753
Everything you need to know,

927
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,875
all the answers,

928
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,995
are in this syringe.

929
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,195
l need you to inject yourself.

930
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,555
lt's the only way to
make you understand.

931
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,709
You're kidding me, right?

932
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,994
We're running out of time, John.

933
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,275
You have to do this now.

934
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,634
Give me the gun, Doctor.

935
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,109
lnspector, he is more
disturbed than we thought.

936
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,474
l may not be the judge
of personality

937
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,754
that you are, Doctor,

938
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,559
but you're the one
who looks disturbed to me.

939
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,234
You do not know
what you are doing.

940
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,838
What, exactly,

941
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,990
is in this... Doctor?

942
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,596
All the answers you've
been looking for, John,

943
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,715
l swear to you.

944
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,028
Uh-huh.

945
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,678
Guess l'll just have to...

946
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,318
hold on to it for...

947
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,958
safekeeping,

948
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,234
if you don't mind.

949
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,435
Let's go, Doctor.

950
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,037
Go? Where are we going?

951
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,918
Shell Beach.

952
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,230
That's where you
want to go, isn't it?

953
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,833
The ocean.

954
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,558
You won't find anything there,

955
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,198
l promise you!
l've been there, and--

956
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,395
lf you've been there,

957
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,515
you can show us the way,
then, can't you?

958
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,318
l won't. l refuse.

959
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,833
You can't make me go there!

960
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,875
Don't you understand?

961
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,154
They'll be waiting for us.

962
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,712
l don't understand.

963
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,392
Used to be a bridge here.

964
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,472
Try that again, your friends
are gonna be fishing you

965
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,788
out of the canal.

966
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,074
Just don't hurt me.
l'll tell you everything.

967
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,116
lt doesn't matter
anymore anyway.

968
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,715
What?

969
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,710
Who are you people?

970
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,394
We must go to the end
of the canal.

971
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,555
We will give you

972
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,076
some more pretty things
soon...Anna.

973
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,718
l'm not Anna.

974
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,271
You will be soon, yes.

975
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,873
l have another use
for her first.

976
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,875
l call them... the strangers.

977
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,509
They abducted us
and brought us here.

978
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,512
The city, everyone in it...

979
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,715
is their experiment.

980
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,791
They mix and match our memories

981
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,949
as they see fit,

982
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,395
trying to divine
what makes us unique.

983
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,631
One day, a man
might be an inspector.

984
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,393
The next, someone
entirely different.

985
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,232
When they want
to study a murder,

986
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,673
for instance,

987
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,320
they simply imprint
one of their citizens

988
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,391
with a new personality,

989
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,390
arrange a family for him,

990
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,392
friends, an entire history,

991
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,198
even a lost wallet.

992
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,271
Then they observe the results.

993
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,069
Will a man, given
the history of a killer,

994
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,559
continue in that vein,

995
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,437
or are we, in fact,

996
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,511
more than the mere sum
of our memories?

997
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,830
This business of you
being a killer

998
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,275
was an unhappy coincidence.

999
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,113
You have had dozens
of lives before now.

1000
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,519
You just happened to wake up

1001
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,555
while l was imprinting you

1002
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,993
with this one.

1003
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,071
Why are they doing all of this?

1004
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,550
lt is our capacity
for individuality,

1005
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,915
our souls that makes
us different from them.

1006
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,309
They think they
can find the human soul

1007
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,119
if they understand
how our memories work.

1008
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,519
All they have
are collective memories.

1009
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,239
They share one group mind.

1010
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,753
They're dying, you see?

1011
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,957
Their entire race is on
the brink of extinction.

1012
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,712
They think we can save them.

1013
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,835
Where do l fit in?

1014
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,239
You are different, John.

1015
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,437
You resisted my attempt
to imprint you.

1016
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,876
Somehow you have developed
their ability to tune.

1017
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,439
That is how they change things.

1018
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,919
That is how they
built this city.

1019
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,878
They have machines very deep
beneath the surface

1020
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,949
that allow them

1021
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,759
to focus their
telepathic energies.

1022
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,432
They control everything here,

1023
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,794
even the sun.

1024
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,359
That's why it's always dark.

1025
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,271
They can't stand the light.

1026
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,429
So why do they need you?

1027
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,511
When they first brought us here,

1028
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,238
they extracted what was in us.

1029
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,117
So they could store
the information,

1030
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,236
remix it like so much paint,

1031
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,878
and give us back new memories

1032
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,870
of their choosing.

1033
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,235
But they still needed an artist

1034
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,275
to help them.

1035
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,593
l understood the intricacies

1036
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,079
of the human mind

1037
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,390
better than they ever could,

1038
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,469
so they allowed me

1039
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,278
to keep my skills
as a scientist,

1040
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,554
because they needed them.

1041
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,995
But they made me
delete everything else.

1042
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,759
Can you imagine what
it is like being forced

1043
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,558
to erase your own past?

1044
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,437
What about my past?

1045
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,511
What about my childhood?

1046
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,239
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

1047
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,117
What about this?

1048
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,878
This was blank
when l found it!

1049
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,791
You still don't
understand, John.

1050
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,552
You were never a boy,

1051
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,959
not in this place.

1052
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,758
Your entire history
is an illusion,

1053
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,750
a fabrication,

1054
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,432
as it is with all of us.

1055
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,873
You made those drawings happen

1056
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,870
with your gift.

1057
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,315
You say they brought us here.

1058
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,595
From where?

1059
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,315
l'm sorry.

1060
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,073
l don't remember.

1061
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,718
None of us remember that,

1062
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,950
what we once were,

1063
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,235
what we might have been...

1064
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,719
somewhere else.

1065
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,237
l've taken you this far.

1066
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,356
You don't need me anymore.

1067
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,158
Let's go.

1068
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,315
John.

1069
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,119
There is no ocean, John.

1070
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,159
There is nothing
beyond the city.

1071
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:20,075
The only place home exists...

1072
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,071
is in your head.

1073
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,718
No! No!

1074
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,518
John, stop!

1075
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,755
Stop!

1076
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,034
Please! No!

1077
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,351
And now you know the truth.

1078
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,034
No!

1079
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,959
You'll allow yourself
to surrender, Mr Murdoch,

1080
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,395
or it will result in
this one's death, yes?

1081
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,436
What do l care?
She's not my real wife!

1082
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,714
She's nothing to me!

1083
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,839
But you do still care,
don't you, Mr Murdoch?

1084
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,388
You see, l have
become the monster

1085
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,357
you were intended to be.

1086
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,158
Unh!

1087
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:28,915
Shall l end her life now
as you would have?

1088
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,791
Don't hurt her, please!

1089
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,396
Then surrender,
Mr Murdoch.

1090
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,072
Sleep.

1091
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,916
Now.

1092
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,398
John?

1093
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,715
Sleep.

1094
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,957
Kill him.

1095
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,598
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

1096
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,035
He is powerful, yes.

1097
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,477
Dangerous. But he can also
lead us to what we seek.

1098
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,711
What the doctor calls the soul.

1099
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,190
lt is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

1100
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,999
We no longer need
the other subjects.

1101
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,470
The time for study is over.

1102
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,951
lt is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

1103
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,718
lt is time, Doctor.

1104
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,392
lmprint.

1105
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,554
Shut it down!

1106
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,677
Shut it down forever!

1107
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,231
What are you doing?

1108
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,157
They want to imprint you

1109
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,470
with their own
collective memories.

1110
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,672
They want to make you
one of them

1111
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,876
so they can share your soul.

1112
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,076
But l've got other plans.

1113
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,796
lmprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

1114
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,677
l'm sorry, John.

1115
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,558
The pain will
only last a moment.

1116
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,515
No!

1117
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,113
Remember...

1118
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,758
John.

1119
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,990
You'll rise to greater
heights than that, my boy.

1120
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,718
One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

1121
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,636
Remember.

1122
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,393
That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

1123
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,552
Remember what l told you.
Never talk to strangers.

1124
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,278
John, remember.

1125
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,113
You're wondering why l keep
appearing in your memories.

1126
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,668
lt is because l have
inserted myself in them.

1127
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,637
Only, these memories
have been fabricated

1128
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,438
to teach you
about the strangers.

1129
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,398
Give you a lifetime of
knowledge in a single syringe.

1130
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,350
You will survive, John.

1131
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,590
You will find strength
within yourself,

1132
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,477
and you will prevail.

1133
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,834
Remember.

1134
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,677
- Hi, Uncle Karl.
- Johnny!

1135
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,556
You're getting
the hang of it, John.

1136
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,393
Maybe one day
l'll be working for you.

1137
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,913
This is the machine
the strangers use

1138
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,399
to amplify their thoughts.

1139
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,311
The machine
that changes their world.

1140
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,753
You must take control of it.

1141
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,319
You must make the machine yours.

1142
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,038
l know
you can beat them, John.

1143
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,190
But you must concentrate.

1144
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,069
Something's wrong.

1145
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,880
There is no time
for romance, John.

1146
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,279
The world can be
what you make it.

1147
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,157
What have you done?

1148
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,629
You have the power
to make anything happen,

1149
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,029
but you must act now!

1150
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,716
l knew you
could do it, John.

1151
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,677
You have their power now.

1152
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,398
You control their machines.

1153
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,959
Where's Emma?

1154
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,191
She is not Emma anymore, John.

1155
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,759
She has been reimprinted.

1156
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,034
So give her back her memories.

1157
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,953
l can't. The facility
where the strangers

1158
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,429
stored the memories
has been destroyed.

1159
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,635
l'm sorry.

1160
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:16,508
What are you going
to do now, John?

1161
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,029
l'm gonna fix things.

1162
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,352
You told me l had
the power, didn't you?

1163
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,228
l can make these machines
do anything l want.

1164
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,596
Make this world anything
l want it to be.

1165
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,753
Just so long as l
concentrate hard enough.

1166
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,232
Where are you going?

1167
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,917
Shell Beach.

1168
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,309
- What's the fare?
- Quarter.

1169
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,270
Oh, please.

1170
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,918
Oh, no.

1171
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,070
Thank you.

1172
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,517
John...

1173
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,110
Been waiting for you, yes?

1174
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,838
What are you doing?

1175
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,593
l'm just making a few little
changes around here is all.

1176
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,671
Are we sure that's what we want?

1177
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,399
l'm prepared to take my chances.

1178
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,072
l'm dying, John.

1179
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,958
Your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind.

1180
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:58,192
But l wanted to know
what it was like...

1181
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,111
how you feel.

1182
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,919
You know how l was
supposed to feel.

1183
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,549
That person isn't me.
Never was.

1184
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,110
You wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human.

1185
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:15,991
Well, you're not going
to find it...in here.

1186
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,469
You went looking
in the wrong place.

1187
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,151
lt's so beautiful here.

1188
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,596
So bright.

1189
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,959
Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

1190
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,429
l think that's it
just over there.

1191
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,910
l'm headed that way myself.

1192
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,715
Would you like to join me?

1193
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:38,835
Sure.

1194
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,429
l'm Anna, by the way.

1195
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,430
What's your name?

1196
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,794
John.

1197
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,471
John Murdoch.

1198
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,713
When the rumba rhythms
start to play

1199
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,518
Dance with me

1200
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,637
Make me sway

1201
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,599
Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore

1202
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,830
Hold me close

1203
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,832
Sway me more

1204
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,754
Like a flower
bending in the breeze

1205
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,910
Bend with me

1206
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,434
Sway with ease

1207
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,274
When we dance,
you have a way with me

1208
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,794
Stay with me

1209
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,553
Sway with me

1210
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:09,031
All the dancers
with me on the floor

1211
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,511
But my eyes
will see only you

1212
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:18,958
Only you have
that magic technique

1213
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,715
Where we sway,
l grow weak

1214
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,588
l can hear
the sound of violins

1215
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,069
Long before

1216
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,833
lt begins

1217
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,799
Make me thrill
as only you know how

1218
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,269
Sway me smooth

1219
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,635
Sway me now

1220
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,996
You gotta sway me now

1221
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,230
Come on, babe

1222
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,072
Come on, babe

1223
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,435
Sway, sway

1224
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,273
Take me

1225
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,912
Sway me
