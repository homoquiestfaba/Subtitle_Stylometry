1
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,081
Chuck, see what it is.

2
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:39,766
<i>( growling )</i>

3
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:41,688
Hey, Miller,
we got something.

4
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:43,850
<i>- Well, what is it?
- Will you just come here?</i>

5
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:50,056
Well, I'll be.
They were right.

6
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:52,418
Yeah, I thought it
was a bunch of bull.

7
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:54,980
Who was right?
What are you guys
talking about?

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,662
Where've you been
for the last month, kid?

9
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,304
Why do think the Indians
have been picketing since
we started this job?

10
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,387
Yeah, man, they're claiming
we're disturbing some
ancient burial ground.

11
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:04,669
But the Katona tribe is
more than 20 miles away.

12
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:06,351
Yeah, I know,

13
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:09,113
But they think anytime
someone finds a freakin'
arrowhead around here,

14
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,155
The land is theirs
and they want it back.

15
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,357
Man...

16
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:15,479
This thing looks
over 100 years old.

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,722
Yeah, and it's gonna
look good in my den under
that moose head too.

18
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,924
<i>- Hey, man, wait wait wait!
- ( growling )</i>

19
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,127
What was that?

20
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,810
<i>Nothing. Come on, guys,
we got to clear out this junk</i>

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,131
<i>So we can finish the job.</i>

22
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,453
Now hit it with that pickax
and try to break it up.

23
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,134
Break it up?

24
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,136
Shouldn't we try to save it?
It might be worth something.

25
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,899
Whatever you say, son.
Give me that pick.

26
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:39,421
<i>( growling )</i>

27
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:43,625
What the hell was that?

28
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:47,268
You think those picketers
are out there beyond
the lights?

29
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:49,911
Yeah, and they're probably
getting a good laugh at
our expense too.

30
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,235
Jeez, that guy
is a hothead.

31
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,121
Well, let's just see 'em
come any closer.

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,444
Miller, you're taking
this way too far.
Give me that.

33
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:06,246
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

34
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:09,289
Not until we finish.
Riley, help me.

35
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,855
<i>( rumbling )</i>

36
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:20,339
What the hell was that?
An earthquake?

37
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,223
I don't know.

38
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,185
<i>I think Hanson's right.</i>

39
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,147
I say we call it a night,
fellas.

40
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,109
Riley,
I've changed my mind.

41
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,151
That sounds like
a good idea.

42
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:35,673
<i>( growling )</i>

43
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,173
( roars )

44
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,098
( screams )

45
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,156
( screams )

46
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,052
Come get it.

47
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,018
( shrieks )

48
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,184
( screams )

49
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,016
Hey.

50
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,262
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Dad.

51
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,186
Look at you.

52
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:08,468
You have grown up.

53
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,191
That's what happens.

54
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,873
Yeah yeah, I guess so.

55
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,436
Guess it's just more dramatic
'cause you're not here
all the time.

56
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,802
Well, here, let me take this
and let's get moving, huh?

57
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,491
Did your mother have
any instructions for me?

58
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:34,692
Instructions?

59
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,374
Yeah, like the last time
you came out

60
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,015
She told me how
to wash your clothes.

61
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,578
Even told me how
to make your toast.

62
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:43,621
That was two years ago.
I can make my own toast now.

63
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:46,784
Wow, you have grown up.

64
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:49,706
You said that already.

65
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:54,591
Look, your mother's in Europe
for the summer,

66
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,593
So like it or not,

67
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,835
<i>We are stuck
with each other.</i>

68
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,756
We can make it go
a whole lot quicker

69
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,878
If we're at least civil

70
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:07,282
with each other, huh?

71
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:11,126
I don't suppose
she gave you any instructions
on how to do that.

72
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,288
No.

73
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:14,889
I guess we're on our own.

74
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,452
( laughs )

75
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,263
What's all that?

76
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,348
Oh, a developer is building
a swanky resort.

77
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:37,270
Katonas are all
up in arms about it.

78
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,192
A swanky resort?

79
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,713
Here?

80
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:42,835
I know.
Come on, I'll get
your bag.

81
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:44,597
It's okay.
I got it.

82
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,800
Just like your mother.

83
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:02,733
Dex, I told you before,
don't call me here.

84
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,415
I'll see you tonight.
Morning, Sheriff.

85
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:08,338
Lolli, what's new
besides you having a date
with Dex tonight?

86
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:11,021
<i>Did the picketers
give you any trouble?</i>

87
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,382
<i>No, I just walked by.</i>

88
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:15,865
- Where's Kelly?
- She's coming in.

89
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:17,987
Even when you're together,
you're not together.

90
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,909
Lolli, is anything
happening?

91
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,751
Well, Sadie Riley called,

92
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,352
Said Paul didn't
make it home last night.

93
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:26,635
Maybe he's just pulled
another all-nighter
out at the site.

94
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,238
<i>- I mean, they're
working 'em like hell.
- Yeah, Dex told me that.</i>

95
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:32,160
I don't think so, Sheriff.

96
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,802
That was Lisa Miller.
Neil was supposed to
take their kid

97
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:35,283
to school this morning,
never came home.

98
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,245
He was working out
at the Krantz site
too, wasn't he?

99
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,287
I think so.

100
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,171
Mark, take the second car.
Go out along 81.

101
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,014
I'll check the 395.
Maybe they got in a wreck.

102
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:49,536
- On my way.
- And I'll meet you
out at the site.

103
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,537
Copy that.

104
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,182
Big Jim,
what are you doing here?

105
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,705
In case you haven't noticed,
the sun is up.

106
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,427
Well, truth be told,

107
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:04,270
today I got
babysitting duties.

108
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,671
What are you talking about?

109
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,073
The field trip,
the university kids,

110
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:09,675
the archeology class.
Remember that?

111
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,717
Oh, right right.
When is that?

112
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,718
I'm on my way over there
right now.

113
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:16,281
Well, keep an eye out
for Miller's truck while
you're out there, okay?

114
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:17,602
- Yeah, sure. See you later.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,168
- Kel!
- Hey!

116
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:26,811
- My Kelly Belly.
- ( giggles )

117
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,452
<i>Oh, girl.</i>

118
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,894
Look at you.
Hollywood is working
for you.

119
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,936
You look just one of
those Hollywood Hotties.

120
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:35,779
I don't even
live in L.A., Loll.
I live in upland.

121
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,861
Well, it's still
1,000 miles closer
than I'll ever get.

122
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,703
Well, don't go too far.
I need you to hold the fort.

123
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,785
<i>Listen, Kel,
I gotta make a run.</i>

124
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:45,668
I'll be back in an hour
or so, then we'll get you
situated, okay?

125
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,469
I got it covered.

126
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,430
All right.

127
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:10,451
Pomeroy, it's 8:20.
Where are the cement trucks?

128
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,612
Why aren't we pouring?

129
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,614
The foundations
aren't ready yet, sir.

130
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,335
I thought you had
that handled.

131
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:18,138
- Well, I did, sir, but--
- But what?

132
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,940
You told me you had
your best men on this
all night.

133
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,542
I did.

134
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,704
Well, where are they?
Why isn't the job done?

135
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,505
That's just the thing,
Mr. Krantz.

136
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,147
When Dex and I showed up
this morning, they were gone.

137
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,908
- They quit?
- Jimmy!

138
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:31,950
I don't think so.
Their cars are still here and--

139
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,832
And what?

140
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,474
Dad! Dad!

141
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:38,997
- Not now, Dex.
- We found more, lots more.

142
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,279
What are you talking about?
You found what?

143
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,442
I think you should see
this for yourself, Mr. Krantz.
This way, please.

144
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:45,923
Jimmy, wait here.

145
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,386
This is all I need.

146
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:15,911
This could be
an incredible find,
Mr. Krantz.

147
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,513
Right.
Cover it up.

148
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:20,635
What?

149
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,797
- Not now, Dex.
- You heard me.

150
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:25,640
Pomeroy, I told you
I want it buried.

151
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,282
But, Mr. Krantz,
Dex has a point. This is--

152
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:30,204
No "buts," Pomeroy.

153
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,726
The Native American Council
finds about this,

154
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,368
they could shut me down
for weeks, possibly years.

155
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,810
I've got too much invested
in this

156
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,732
to see shoot it down
the tubes right now.

157
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,534
Understood.

158
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,216
Dex, you know what to do.

159
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,498
Get the survey team started
on the second quadrant.

160
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:47,260
And you tell 'em

161
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,783
if they find any more
of these relics,

162
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:53,185
I want 'em bagged
and sent straight back to me.

163
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:55,627
Son, you heard the man,
get going.

164
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,990
Whatever you say, Dad.

165
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,555
( exhales )

166
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:04,876
All right.

167
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:08,239
How many men beside you
and your boy know about this?

168
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,641
Just the morning crew
of 10, sir.

169
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,563
Tell them I'm gonna
double their salary,

170
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:15,526
and I want them on the Hawaiian
project as of tomorrow.

171
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,407
Jimmy'll make all
the arrangements.

172
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,930
What about Miller
and the other two
that split last night?

173
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,012
If they come back again,
tell them I want to see
them first.

174
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,574
Now let's get this show
on the road.

175
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:27,016
I'll get the tractor
warmed up.

176
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:28,738
Yeah, you do that.

177
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,024
Look at him, will you?

178
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:43,271
He ain't had a hammer
in his hand in his whole life.

179
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,673
<i>So what's up with
the big cheese anyway?</i>

180
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,316
I didn't think
I'd see him out here
until the ribbon ceremony.

181
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:51,439
You know Mr. Krantz.
He loves to micromanage.

182
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,560
<i>He wants you all to be
on the lookout</i>

183
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,083
for any Indian relics
you might find in
the next parcel.

184
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,365
Maybe he should
come out with us and survey
and scout around a bit.

185
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:01,087
That's not gonna happen.
He's not gonna get his ass
out of the trailer.

186
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,889
It's gonna be
110 in the shade.

187
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,732
Meaning the faster
we get this done, the faster
we get out of here,

188
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:07,613
so let's head out.

189
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:11,497
Don't forget
to check in later.

190
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,867
<i>Jim on radio:
hello, Steve.</i>

191
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,791
Evans, go ahead.

192
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,232
It's Jim here.

193
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:30,715
I got the students
all situated pretty well

194
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,596
<i>out at the Krantz site
and I'm headed back.</i>

195
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,598
Any sign of Riley's truck?

196
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:36,600
That's a negative.

197
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,921
<i>All right, well,
keep looking, will you?</i>

198
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,282
<i>Right, I'll keep my eyes open.
See you later.</i>

199
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,737
Look at him, will you?

200
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,981
I thought we were out here
to study archeology,
not astronomy.

201
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,822
Give him a break, Josh.

202
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,984
I want to see the eclipse
too when it happens.

203
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:06,147
It's not gonna happen
for two more days, Rach.

204
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,468
Right.

205
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:08,910
Hey, Professor!

206
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,871
You find something,
Mr. McMurphy?

207
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:12,513
Not yet.
I was just wondering

208
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,955
how the stars
were looking this morning.

209
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,198
Your comedic talents
overwhelm me, Mr. McMurphy.

210
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,640
I'd think you'd want to drop
all your other courses

211
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,443
and concentrate solely
on standup.

212
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:25,445
Sorry, Professor.
Just kidding.

213
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:29,048
I know, but if
I've taught you anything
over the last semester,

214
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,410
it's that a good scientist
knows when to look down

215
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,332
<i>and up.</i>

216
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,734
Hell, a major celestial event
like this won't take place again

217
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,336
until 2078.

218
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,137
I can wait.

219
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:42,220
Is it true this is
the best place to
see it, Professor?

220
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,902
According to the observatory,
the optimum place

221
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,144
for viewing
the eclipse is right here
in the Alabama Hills.

222
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:49,827
I guess that's why
all the motels in town
were full up.

223
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,590
It's history.
Just like what you're digging
for here in the earth.

224
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:57,995
When you three realize
all the sciences are mutually
bound together,

225
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:01,518
you'll finally have learned
something meaningful.

226
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,840
Now keep working.

227
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:11,287
Hey, Professor,
wait a minute,
check this out.

228
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,689
What now, Mr. Cook?
Hopefully not more of
your would-be arrowheads.

229
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,011
No no,
this is something else.

230
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,338
Man, that's weird.

231
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,899
<i>What is it?</i>

232
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,462
- It's bones.
I can tell you that.
- Keep brushing.

233
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:28,943
Yes, by all means, Mr. Cook,
keep brushing.

234
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,153
That's no dinosaur bone.

235
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:41,154
<i>Rachel:
it looks like a mammal.</i>

236
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,677
I think it's a femur.

237
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,880
<i>- ( rumbling )
- ( groaning )</i>

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,402
Jeez, what was that?

239
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:50,803
A tremor.

240
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:53,926
I didn't know that
we were on a fault line.

241
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:55,408
We're not.

242
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,569
<i>- ( rumbling )
- ( groaning )</i>

243
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,136
Is everyone okay?

244
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,017
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

245
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:07,819
Yeah.

246
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,983
Okay.

247
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,424
Let's get back to work.

248
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:37,927
( Chuckles )

249
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:40,169
<i>( growling )</i>

250
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,457
Oh my god!

251
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,821
( roars )

252
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:56,183
Run!

253
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,184
Get to the jeep!

254
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:02,669
Now!

255
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:06,112
Let's get out of here.
Oh my god.

256
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,956
( screams )

257
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,119
( screams )

258
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:18,244
( Rachel screams )

259
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,605
Oh my god!

260
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:30,975
Oh, god!

261
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,057
Oh oh, please!

262
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:34,939
Please!

263
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:38,102
( sobbing )

264
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,264
Please, please don't!

265
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:41,505
Don't!

266
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,189
No no!

267
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:49,352
( screams )

268
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,758
( screams )

269
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,623
Just in the nick of time.

270
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:37,396
Excuse me, sir.
There's a call on the car
phone for you, sir.

271
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:39,799
Right, take care of it.

272
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:15,031
Skipper, I'll give
the place the once-over.

273
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:18,114
Yeah.
That's Pomeroy over there.

274
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:21,917
Maybe he knows something.

275
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,563
Look, just make sure
that second quadrant
is clear, okay?

276
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:31,526
Sheriff, glad you're here.
I was just about to call you.

277
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:32,927
About two missing men,
right?

278
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:34,689
Actually three.

279
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,611
Well, there's Miller,
Riley and who else?

280
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:39,573
A new kid-- Chuck Hanson.
Just came on the past week.

281
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,495
Any idea what happened
to them?

282
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:42,856
Not a clue.

283
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:11,283
<i>Pomeroy.</i>

284
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:12,804
What's the Sheriff
got to say?

285
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,445
Sheriff,
this is Richard Krantz.

286
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:17,368
Mr. Krantz, it's a pleasure
to meet the man behind
the curtain.

287
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,011
You got quite
an operation here.

288
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,494
It's just the beginning,
Sheriff.

289
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:27,097
This desert is gonna
be an oasis within
two years. You wait.

290
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,179
I'm sure you're right,

291
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,102
Provided your workers
don't keep disappearing.

292
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:35,545
So they didn't make it home
either, I take it.

293
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:37,387
No.

294
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,068
You're working them
pretty hard, aren't you?

295
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,470
I pay them well, Sheriff.

296
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,392
This may be a little sensitive,

297
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:46,475
but why don't you question
the picketers

298
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:48,397
that are in front
of your office?

299
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:51,600
They're doing
everything they can
to hold up this project.

300
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,282
So you think the Katonas
are behind this?

301
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,404
No secrets
about the threats.

302
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:58,526
- Not to mention phone calls--
- Jimmy!

303
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,087
Yes, sir.

304
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,490
<i>All I'm suggesting</i>

305
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,412
is that the Katonas
have a definite motive,

306
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,654
and you should at least
question them.

307
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:11,057
Mr. Krantz,
until I find some evidence
of foul play,

308
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,899
I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

309
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,864
Sheriff.

310
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:21,427
I found this out
beyond the construction
perimeter in the brush.

311
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:23,869
That's Miller's rifle.

312
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,951
Along with this.

313
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,234
Well, that should be
enough evidence

314
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,556
for you to start
an investigation, Sheriff.

315
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,478
Mr. Krantz,
if it's all the same to you,

316
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,320
you do your job
and let me do mine.

317
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:39,003
Let's go.

318
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:46,690
All right, Pomeroy,
you're still pouring
today, right?

319
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,012
Yes, sir.
All right, let's get
the lead out.

320
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,214
We got some
foundation to lay.

321
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:52,776
Mark, I want you
to bag that stuff up,

322
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:54,457
drive it over to forensics
at County seat.

323
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:56,579
- Tell Coogan
to put a priority on it.
- Sure thing, boss.

324
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,221
And call Sachetti
at the impound.

325
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:01,304
Tell him to tow
those vehicles in
for a going-over.

326
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:02,465
What do you
think's going on?

327
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:05,267
I don't know.
I'm not quite sure,

328
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,229
But I don't trust that guy.

329
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,034
I think he knows
a hell of a lot more
than he's telling.

330
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,436
Where you headed?

331
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:17,278
Take a drive over
to the reservation,
talk to Storm Cloud.

332
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:18,640
Maybe he knows something.

333
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,121
Maybe he does,Chief.

334
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,543
Okay.

335
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,906
Yeah, no, that's fine.

336
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:48,827
It just means I'm gonna have
to make three separate trips.

337
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,069
Best get started
then, Mikey.

338
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,112
The Sheriff wants
those vehicles towed
in immediately.

339
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:56,274
All right.

340
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,996
I'll get on it
right away, Mark.

341
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,920
Right away.

342
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,162
Almost.

343
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,695
Well well.

344
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:21,257
- When did you
get back in town?
- This morning.

345
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,901
This morning?

346
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,423
I see.

347
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,626
What took so long?

348
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,067
Things.

349
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:36,231
I see.

350
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:38,753
And so now you're back
for the whole summer?

351
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,395
Apparently.

352
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:46,480
Do you have anything
you want to say to me?

353
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,403
Yeah.

354
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,004
Yeah, actually,
as a matter of fact I do.

355
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:53,487
I hayesed you.

356
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,210
Me too.

357
00:23:58,852 --> 00:23:59,933
( squeals )

358
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,189
<i>Man:
you make no sense at all.</i>

359
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,072
Advancing our cause
doesn't mean you have
to be belligerent

360
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:22,874
with everyone
who disagrees with you.

361
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:25,916
I only want what's right
for our people and us, Kaya.

362
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,559
That's just it, Black Hawk,
there is no "us."

363
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,482
<i>- There never was.
- What do you mean?</i>

364
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:34,284
I don't wish to be a part
of your militant stance
with the townspeople.

365
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:36,326
Now you talk
like your grandfather--

366
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,568
Weak, tired,

367
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:41,371
unwilling to stand up
for our rights.

368
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:42,892
If the white man has
taught us anything,

369
00:24:42,892 --> 00:24:45,094
it's that we must fight
for what we want.

370
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:47,696
Yes, fight,

371
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,899
but I do not like
how you do battle.

372
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:02,070
Well, hello, Sheriff.

373
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,552
- Kaya.
- You come to arrest
us all today?

374
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:06,073
No, nothing like that.

375
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,155
Just need some questions
answered is all.

376
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:10,878
- Is your grandfather home?
- He's just starting
sweat lodge.

377
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:13,680
Okay, I can come back later.

378
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,402
No, please,
I'm sure he'll see you.
Come.

379
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:17,804
Yeah?
All right.

380
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,053
So how's your teaching
been this semester?

381
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,615
It's okay, I guess.
It's been a bit tough.

382
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:33,018
With the cuts
in federal funding we've had
to combine a lot of classes.

383
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:35,380
But the students
have adapted well.

384
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,064
Maybe you folks
should think about opening
a casino around here.

385
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:41,466
Grandfather doesn't
believe in them.

386
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:43,147
Says they weaken the spirit.

387
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:45,790
Maybe so,
but it sure would bring
in some much-needed revenue.

388
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,032
And it would also bring
drunkenness,

389
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,274
prostitution and crime.

390
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:53,637
<i>Steve:
oh, good morning to you,
Storm Cloud.</i>

391
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,320
Sheriff Evans is here
to ask you some questions,
grandfather.

392
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,801
<i>I didn't think you'd mind.</i>

393
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,123
Running Wolf,
it is always good
to see a brother.

394
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:03,726
Haven't heard that name
in awhile.

395
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:07,250
Maybe you should use it
more often.

396
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,971
I might, if I could
only convince people

397
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:11,253
to get beyond the color
of my hair and eyes.

398
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:14,216
One just needs to look
at your beautiful daughter

399
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:16,058
to know that your bloodline
runs strong.

400
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,059
- So how is Kelly?
- She's fine.

401
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,741
Just got back in town today.

402
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:22,383
She has the spirit
of the Katona.

403
00:26:22,383 --> 00:26:24,385
And her mother's attitude.

404
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:26,667
She's young.
Come.

405
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:31,432
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I must be going, Sheriff.

406
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:32,553
My next class is at 11:00.

407
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:34,154
Thank you, Kaya.

408
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:42,001
( hissing )

409
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:46,566
You have come about
the incident at the worksite,
have you not?

410
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:49,328
Yes, that's right.
How did you know?

411
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:51,530
I heard about it earlier.

412
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,813
- From who?
- Chinkana.

413
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,256
Chinkana.
Don't know him.

414
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,417
It's Indian for grapevine.

415
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:05,303
Yes, three men
have gone missing.

416
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:08,986
And you think that someone
here may be responsible?

417
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:12,750
Maybe, maybe not.

418
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,352
There have been threats made
by some of the picketers.

419
00:27:15,352 --> 00:27:18,635
Angry words don't always
lead to violence.

420
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,397
Three men are missing,

421
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:24,240
but I didn't say anything
about violence.

422
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,042
If you know something,
Storm Cloud--

423
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:29,565
I know that
that's why you're here--
to accuse one of us.

424
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,688
This is just a follow-up.

425
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:36,131
None of our people set foot
on that ground last night.

426
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:38,974
And neither
should anyone else.

427
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:41,776
What happened to the men
was a sign.

428
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,258
The construction must stop.

429
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:46,341
With all due respect,
Storm Cloud,

430
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:50,064
That land is not
on the Katona reservation.

431
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:52,466
Still, it is on unholy land.

432
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:55,549
Listen to me.
I was out there just
this morning.

433
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,110
There is nothing there
to indicate

434
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,513
that your ancestors
were ever there.

435
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:02,115
<i>Our ancestors,
Running Wolf.</i>

436
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,516
Our ancestors!

437
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,758
Have you forgotten that
your grandfather,

438
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:07,800
A great chief, is buried
on this reservation?

439
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,407
No, I haven't.

440
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,489
<i>You must never forget.</i>

441
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,972
The blood of the chiefs
also flows inside of you,
Running Wolf.

442
00:28:20,972 --> 00:28:23,855
It's what gives you
the strength over evil.

443
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,380
I understand that,
Storm Cloud.

444
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,585
But being Sheriff allows me

445
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:37,948
to extend that power
for the good of all.

446
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,553
Then know that whatever lies
out beyond our borders

447
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:45,835
should be left undisturbed

448
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:47,557
for the sake of all.

449
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,693
Well, half-breed,

450
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:07,455
who do you
serve today, hmm?

451
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,298
Indian or White Man?

452
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,743
Both equally.

453
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:19,226
If only it were the truth.

454
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,660
Dude, I say
we call it a day.

455
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,224
We got about another hour
of daylight left.

456
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:02,346
Let's just go ahead
and knock it off, though.

457
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:04,267
Then we don't have to
come back tomorrow, okay?

458
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,750
Whatever.

459
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,473
Hey, Lou, go ahead
and move to your left
about a foot, would you?

460
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:13,716
All right,
but let's make this quick.
I'm toast already on one side.

461
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:15,798
<i>- ( rumbling )
- Whoa! Hey hey, hey!</i>

462
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,761
What was that?

463
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:25,006
<i>What the hell are you guys
doing down there?</i>

464
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,649
- You didn't feel
that up there?
- Feel what?

465
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:30,371
We had a serious earthquake
just hit us down here.
You didn't feel it?

466
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,773
Come on,
quit fooling around, you guys.
Let's just get this thing done.

467
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:34,655
<i>I didn't feel anything.</i>

468
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,143
Okay.
Hey, Lou, do me a favor
and move forward

469
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,625
about three feet.

470
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,027
That's more like it.

471
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:52,351
( growling )

472
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,833
No!

473
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,397
What the--
Dave, Dave!

474
00:30:58,397 --> 00:30:59,678
What the hell is that?

475
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:08,326
Let's get out of here, man.
Come on!

476
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,636
( groans )

477
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,863
Holy--

478
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,745
<i>( screams )</i>

479
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:08,171
( chanting )

480
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:21,904
Step forward, warrior.

481
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,152
You have seen
the Bone Eater.

482
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,075
It has risen,

483
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,197
And the sacred moon
will soon obscure the sun.

484
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,119
Time is short.

485
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,641
I must know its secret
before it's too late.

486
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:43,844
There is no secret,
only death.

487
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:45,926
They brought this demon
onto themselves.

488
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:48,969
But we can use it
to our own advantage.

489
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,610
No.

490
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,493
The Bone Eater is an enemy
of all life,

491
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:55,695
not just the white man.

492
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,698
Once all six renegades
have been resurrected,

493
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:01,060
<i>The creature
will be unstoppable.</i>

494
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,342
You must find the bone axe.

495
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:06,745
The creature must be destroyed
before the six become one.

496
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:09,147
If you're too afraid
to wield that power,

497
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,149
then tell me
of this sacred weapon.

498
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,751
I will find it myself.

499
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:15,513
Now who is being foolish?

500
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,675
Once the eclipse
has completed,

501
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,957
It will take the will
of the gods to destroy it.

502
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:22,319
I don't believe you.

503
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:24,041
With the creature
as our ally,

504
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,284
we could drive the white man
from all of our land,

505
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:29,726
Restore our people
to prominence!

506
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,489
Anger clouds you,
Black Hawk.

507
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:35,412
You cannot befriend evil
to do your bidding.

508
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:38,014
There must be a way.

509
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:41,417
And I will soon discover it,

510
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,939
With or without your help.

511
00:35:48,383 --> 00:35:50,946
( continues chanting )

512
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,710
<i>( loud rock music playing )</i>

513
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,835
Hey, Kelly,
turn the music down, will you?
I'm on the phone.

514
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:02,637
<i>All right!</i>

515
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:05,239
I'm sorry, Sal.
If you don't mind,
could you repeat that?

516
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,920
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

517
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,724
I said I found traces
of crystallized blood
and bone samples

518
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:14,047
- embedded
in the cloth you sent me.
- What does that mean?

519
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,729
Well, for that to happen,
the victim would have had
to have fallen

520
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:18,371
straight into a blast furnace.

521
00:36:18,371 --> 00:36:21,214
There's nothing like that
out there.

522
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:23,175
And here's something
for sherlock Holmes:

523
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:27,499
The shirt itself
shows absolutely no signs
of being burned.

524
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,421
Could the blood samples
have been introduced

525
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,383
into the cloth
sometime later?

526
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:33,064
<i>Not a chance.</i>

527
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:34,946
<i>You sure about that?</i>

528
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:36,347
I'd stake my pension on it.

529
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:38,269
Well, thanks, Sal.

530
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,151
As usual,
you've ruined my day.

531
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,833
Sorry, Steve.

532
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,995
I'll send you
some free aspirin,
on the county.

533
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,436
Yeah,
I'll be looking for it.

534
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,922
( wolf-whistles )

535
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:54,524
Come on, Dad,
nobody does that anymore.

536
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:56,446
Well, I guess
I'm getting old, Kel.

537
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:58,728
Where you going
all made up like that?

538
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:01,050
I'm going up to big pine
to see a movie.

539
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,652
Tonight?

540
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:04,974
We haven't spent
two minutes together.

541
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:08,097
We have all summer, right?

542
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:10,219
Yeah.

543
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,781
I don't want you going up
to big pine tonight.

544
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,223
What's the big deal?
It's just a date.

545
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:16,825
With who?

546
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:20,708
It's not that Sachetti kid,
is it?

547
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,511
<i>- What if it is?
- He's too old for you.</i>

548
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,312
Dad, he's just 21.

549
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:27,474
Well, four years at your age

550
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:29,596
is a lot of difference.

551
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,838
Mom is four years younger
than you.

552
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:33,200
It's not the same thing.

553
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,443
It is to me.
I can handle myself!

554
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,606
Yeah, well,
that's just what I'm afraid of.

555
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:41,768
Look...

556
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:44,170
Can't you just humor
your old man once

557
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,691
and stick around?

558
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:47,933
No, I'll be back later.

559
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,495
No, you'll be back
at 11:00.

560
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,176
Dad, I'm 17.

561
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:53,819
My house, my rules.

562
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,300
- 11:00.
- Whatever.

563
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,427
Great.

564
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:12,636
Let me
get this straight.

565
00:38:12,636 --> 00:38:15,398
You just compromised your
integrity for money?

566
00:38:15,398 --> 00:38:17,881
What he's doing is wrong,
Dad, and you know it.

567
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,003
Look, don't lecture me
on what's right and wrong,
all right?

568
00:38:20,003 --> 00:38:22,165
That money is putting your ass
through engineering school.

569
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,727
You don't want it?
You wanna spend the rest of
your life digging ditches?

570
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:28,170
- That's fine with me.
- Money isn't everything, pop.

571
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,652
And I'd rather you not sell
your soul to Krantz

572
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:32,094
just to put me
through college.

573
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:34,976
Look, son,

574
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:37,379
it's easy to have high morals
when you're 22.

575
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,502
But at my age,
how am I gonna start over?

576
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:42,904
A man like Krantz
has the power

577
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,706
to ruin me
for the rest of my life.

578
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:48,269
Only 'cause you gave it
to him, Dad.

579
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:57,677
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

580
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:07,967
Kaya,
is everything okay?

581
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,728
I hope it's not too late.

582
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:13,011
No, not at all.
Please, come in.

583
00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:19,818
Anything I can get you?

584
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,620
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

585
00:39:24,302 --> 00:39:25,903
So what brings you over?

586
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:27,985
Look, Steve,

587
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:29,907
I know why you were
at the reservation earlier.

588
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:30,988
It's those missing men.

589
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:33,230
Storm cloud sent you,
didn't he?

590
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,473
I felt that he was
holding something back.

591
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,835
No no,
I came on my own.

592
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,597
Look, Kaya,

593
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:43,880
All evidence points to the fact
that these men are dead.

594
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,883
Now if you know something,
you need to tell me.

595
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:49,885
Well, it's not something
you're gonna want to hear.

596
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,527
It's Black Hawk,
isn't it?

597
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:53,609
No.

598
00:39:58,213 --> 00:39:59,814
Have you ever heard
the legend of the Bone Eater?

599
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:03,858
Yeah, the curse of Torak.

600
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,421
Yeah, my older brother
used to spook me

601
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,463
by telling me scary stories
about it.

602
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:12,786
Well, according to Storm Cloud,
the legend is true.

603
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,868
<i>- Come on.
- Two centuries ago,</i>

604
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:16,870
The Katona tribe
and white settlers alike

605
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,033
were menaced by a band
of six renegades

606
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,915
led by a young shaman
named Torak.

607
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:25,518
Yeah, he was bypassed
as rightful chief,

608
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:27,280
So he broke
from the tribe, right?

609
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,362
They harmed so many
in their quest for power,

610
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:33,565
engaging in ritualistic murder,
even cannibalism.

611
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,448
<i>It took several
medicine men</i>

612
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:39,491
and many warriors
to finally surround the six
and destroy them.

613
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:42,013
They were buried
unceremoniously

614
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,375
<i>in the same area
where 30 years ago</i>

615
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,578
<i>A group of miners uncovered
the sacred bone axe.</i>

616
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:54,304
<i>Tragically, the creature
awoke from its slumber.</i>

617
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:56,867
<i>The men were pierced
with shards of sharp bone,</i>

618
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:58,108
<i>disintegrating them.</i>

619
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,391
( growling )

620
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:02,832
( screaming )

621
00:41:04,954 --> 00:41:07,597
<i>Kaya:
Before the miners realized what
they had done, it was too late.</i>

622
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:15,604
<i>One of them was able
to pierce the creature
with the sacred bone axe,</i>

623
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:17,486
<i>sending it back
into the earth.</i>

624
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:20,328
<i>But unfortunately,
none of them survived.</i>

625
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,057
<i>By building on that land,</i>

626
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:32,500
<i>Krantz has desecrated
the sacred ground</i>

627
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,662
<i>And once again
awakened the Bone Eater.</i>

628
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,505
That is why Storm Cloud
wanted the ground left alone.

629
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:41,228
Kaya, this is
the 21st century.

630
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:42,709
<i>I can't act on legend.</i>

631
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,111
These are evil spirits

632
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,153
that were sealed
in the earth eternally

633
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:49,075
with a sacred war axe.

634
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:51,717
Yeah yeah,
and before he died

635
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,359
Torak cursed his killers,

636
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,322
Saying that his bones
and the bones of his brothers
would rise up

637
00:41:57,322 --> 00:41:59,404
like a demon
and take revenge.

638
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:01,486
Right after the ghost
of Christmas past.

639
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:04,809
I should not have come.

640
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:09,614
Kaya, I'm sorry,
listen.

641
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,497
Please please,
forgive me.

642
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,740
It's just that I've got
three men missing,

643
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,222
presumed dead, and I can't go
to these people's families

644
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:21,064
With legends
of bone creatures.

645
00:42:21,064 --> 00:42:22,786
<i>Steve, this demon lives.</i>

646
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:24,427
We are in great danger.

647
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:29,031
Kaya.

648
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:31,554
For what it's worth,

649
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:33,636
Thank you for coming over here
and telling me this.

650
00:42:35,157 --> 00:42:37,599
It is only worth something
if you listen.

651
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:55,696
Now just for a few minutes,
okay?

652
00:42:55,696 --> 00:42:59,459
Relax, Lol,
nothing's gonna happen.

653
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:00,861
Well, maybe something.

654
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:04,424
Yeah, if you're lucky.

655
00:43:04,424 --> 00:43:06,346
I got something for you.

656
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:09,629
Yeah, I got a good idea
what it is too.
( laughs )

657
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:13,152
No, really.
Here.

658
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:15,875
Oh my god, Dex.

659
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:18,357
You're so sweet.

660
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:20,839
- What is it?
- Go ahead and open it.

661
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,684
I can't believe it.

662
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:28,526
It's so beautiful.

663
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:31,048
- Where did you get this?
- At the site.

664
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:32,570
You're kidding me.

665
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,653
No no, there's tons
of great stuff out there.

666
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:37,574
But when I saw that,

667
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,857
I knew it was meant for you.

668
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:44,221
I took it to the town jeweler,
had him shine it up like new.

669
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,543
You're the best.

670
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:57,112
Here, wait.
Let's see what it looks like.

671
00:44:02,397 --> 00:44:04,119
So what do you think?

672
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,122
It's beautiful,
just like you.

673

<i>( growling )</i>

674

I don't know.

- No, he won't.

- You have a legitimate excuse.
- Yeah, well...

I don't know.

You just get in here today,

690

about you going back.

691
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,352
Don't.

692
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:12,877
Why don't you just stay?

693
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:15,399
And live where?
With my father?

694
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,802
We'll be lucky
if we make it through
the summer in one piece.

695
00:46:17,802 --> 00:46:21,485
So come live with me.

696
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:23,407
Do you want to be the one
to tell him that?

697
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:28,091
No, thanks.

698
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:31,574
Jeez, it's so late.
I gotta go in.

699
00:46:31,574 --> 00:46:33,176
Do you want me
to come in with you,
try to explain?

700
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:36,539
No no no, I think it's better
if I do it myself.

701
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,742
- Where is my purse?
- I think you left it
in the back seat.

702
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:41,183
<i>What is that?</i>

703
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:46,468
That? I don't know.
It's some old tomahawk.

704
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:48,710
I found it lying
around the lot this afternoon.

705
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,032
<i>Now...</i>

706
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:52,834
Why don't you slide
over here a minute?

707
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,002
Oh, jeez!
Okay, you have to go.

708
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,485
Okay okay.
Hey, call me tomorrow.

709
00:47:04,485 --> 00:47:07,127
Okay, just drive.

710
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:20,179
Do you know what time
it is, young lady?

711
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:21,820
Late, I know.

712
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,622
It's 3:15 A.M.

713
00:47:23,622 --> 00:47:26,184
That is beyond late!

714
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:30,989
Kelly, I thought I told you

715
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:33,231
to get back home
before 11:00.

716
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:35,633
I would have been, Dad,
but there was a huge accident

717
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,435
on the other side
of the county line.

718
00:47:37,435 --> 00:47:41,318
Come on, that kind of B.S.
Doesn't cut it with me anymore.

719
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:43,320
I'm not lying.

720
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,082
If you don't start telling
the truth, you can forget about

721
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:46,523
ever seeing that
Sachetti kid again.

722
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:48,325
You can't tell me
who I can date.

723
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,767
When you're in my house,
I sure as hell can!

724
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,049
Look, Dad,

725
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:55,211
There really was
an accident, okay?

726
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:58,694
Traffic was backed up
for miles.  I'm surprised
they didn't call you.

727
00:47:58,694 --> 00:48:00,736
Yeah, me too.

728
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:02,858
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

729
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,663
Yeah, Evans here.

730
00:48:08,663 --> 00:48:11,146
Hey, boss, sorry to wake you.
It's Roberts.

731
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:14,469
That's okay, buddy.
I was up.

732
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:17,071
<i>Just got a call from Burns
down at the station.</i>

733
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:19,193
He got a dispatch
from highway patrol
about a truck accident

734
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:20,995
a couple hours ago
up near Big Pine.

735
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:23,237
Yeah, Kelly was just
telling me about it.

736
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:25,439
<i>Sheriff,
there's something else.</i>

737
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,521
<i>A vehicle was found
smashed to pieces</i>

738
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:30,323
<i>up on Krantz's property
near the site.</i>

739
00:48:30,323 --> 00:48:32,445
How's it affect us?

740
00:48:32,445 --> 00:48:34,447
They found a purse
on the side of the road.

741
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:35,808
Sheriff, it's Lolli's.

742
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:40,493
Are you sure about that?

743
00:48:40,493 --> 00:48:42,455
Yeah, they found her county I.D.
Inside the wallet.

744
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:45,337
- They called us right away.
- Right.

745
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:47,299
I'll go check it out.

746
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,221
Sheriff, if it's okay,
I'd like to go.

747
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:51,183
Yeah, I'll see you
out there.

748
00:48:53,945 --> 00:48:55,667
What was that about?

749
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,508
Nothing, it's just routine.

750
00:48:57,508 --> 00:48:59,030
Now who's B.S.ing?

751
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:02,753
I'm sorry, honey.

752
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:05,155
I really am.
I shouldn't have doubted you.

753
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,398
So what's really the matter?

754
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,682
Lolli may have been hurt.

755
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:15,485
I'll call you
when I know more, okay?

756
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:26,975
Hank, you got any
of this figured out yet?

757
00:49:26,975 --> 00:49:28,377
Not yet, Steve,

758
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:31,139
But it's the damnedest
thing I've ever seen.

759
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:34,422
The skid marks are here,
yet the truck's over
100 feet away.

760
00:49:36,664 --> 00:49:38,786
<i>Looks like somebody moved it
after the accident.</i>

761
00:49:38,786 --> 00:49:40,708
That would take
half a dozen tow trucks.

762
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:43,711
Yeah, and why the hell would
anybody want to do that?

763
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:45,312
And the driver?

764
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:47,234
Not here.

765
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,997
I figure he must
have been thrown clear
and wandered off in a daze,

766
00:49:49,997 --> 00:49:51,598
unless somebody
carted him off.

767
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,281
Where'd you find this?

768
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:57,123
Right over there
by the shoulder.

769
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:00,646
Show me exactly.

770
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,931
Heads up.
Here comes trouble.

771
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:11,817
Yeah, you got that right.

772
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:17,061
Sheriff, this is getting
way out of hand.

773
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:19,183
You haul that chief in
for questioning

774
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,465
and I guarantee you
he's gonna crack.

775
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:24,789
Mr. Krantz, there's still
no proof that the Katonas
are responsible for this.

776
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:27,271
When are you gonna to wake up
and smell the war paint?

777
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:29,793
First, three men are missing.

778
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,435
This driver's the fourth,

779
00:50:31,435 --> 00:50:33,837
to say nothing
about my property.

780
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:36,199
Now it's obvious
to me that they are responsible

781
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,802
and I want to know
when you're going to
make an arrest.

782
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,004
Let me ask you a question
for a change.

783
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:43,726
What?

784
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:47,289
Have you uncovered
anything unusual recently
out at your site?

785
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:51,053
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

786
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,654
Well, have you?

787
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,135
No, I have not.

788
00:50:56,658 --> 00:51:00,061
Well, you realize
of course that failing
to notify the authorities

789
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:01,983
of a historical find
on state-granted land

790
00:51:01,983 --> 00:51:04,225
would constitute fraud.

791
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:06,187
<i>Could even subject the owner</i>

792
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:09,229
to severe civil
and criminal penalties.

793
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:12,673
You know, Sheriff,
I've been in business
a long time.

794
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:16,356
I've gone head to head
with the top men in
almost every field.

795
00:51:16,356 --> 00:51:19,038
And I don't intend
to be intimidated

796
00:51:19,038 --> 00:51:22,121
by some bumpkin lawman
who has a soft spot
for his people.

797
00:51:23,883 --> 00:51:26,285
Now I suggest that
you find out what's going on,

798
00:51:26,285 --> 00:51:29,168
and I mean fast,
because the next phone call
I make

799
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:31,009
is to your boss
in the county office.

800
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:34,012
Fine.

801
00:51:34,012 --> 00:51:35,694
<i>Here.</i>

802
00:51:38,977 --> 00:51:40,578
Number's on the card.

803
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:43,861
Excuse me, Mr. Krantz.
Mr. Pomeroy's on
the car phone.

804
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:45,823
<i>- he says it's urgent.
- what does he want?</i>

805
00:51:45,823 --> 00:51:48,185
- He wouldn't say, sir.
- I'm leaving here anyway.
Come on.

806
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:50,507
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

807
00:51:52,189 --> 00:51:54,431
You complain about having
to get me coffee.

808
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:55,672
Never again, Sheriff.

809
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,838
What a pair.

810
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:04,200
All right, where was
that purse exactly?

811
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,002
Right over here.

812
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:10,686
Found it
sitting right here.

813
00:52:10,686 --> 00:52:12,287
Thanks a lot, Hank.

814
00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:25,379
She came from the woods.
She was running.

815
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,261
Hard.

816
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:29,823
You can tell all that
just by looking at the grass?

817
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,985
My grandfather taught me
when I was a kid.

818
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:34,107
Yeah, but how can you tell?

819
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:37,110
A good Indian tracker
can read a trail across
solid rock.

820
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:40,713
Come on.

821
00:52:51,243 --> 00:52:53,405
Got something, Sheriff?

822
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:55,327
Yeah.

823
00:52:55,327 --> 00:52:57,209
Yeah, look here.

824
00:52:57,209 --> 00:52:59,290
This branch was broken
fairly recently

825
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:02,974
and it came from at least
15 or 20 feet up

826
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:05,376
in these trees.

827
00:53:05,376 --> 00:53:09,220
So whatever was chasing her
was at least that tall.

828
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,582
A bear?

829
00:53:11,582 --> 00:53:13,864
A 15-foot bear?
Not likely.

830
00:53:13,864 --> 00:53:15,465
Well, what then?

831
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,632
What's this?

832
00:53:27,076 --> 00:53:29,478
Look at these relics.
This could be an old
Indian's grave.

833
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:32,121
I thought the ancient tribes
never buried their own
in the ground.

834
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:35,364
No, they burned the bodies
as offerings to their gods.

835
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:37,405
<i>Monroe to Sheriff Evans,
come in.</i>

836
00:53:40,368 --> 00:53:42,490
This is Evans, go ahead.

837
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,012
Hey, Steve, those helicopters
haven't found any sign

838
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:47,535
of that missing driver yet,
but we did spot an abandoned
vehicle

839
00:53:47,535 --> 00:53:49,577
Along the road to the lake.

840
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:51,338
All right, we're close.
We'll check it out.

841
00:53:51,338 --> 00:53:54,141
You got it.
A couple patrol cars are coming
down the service road as well.

842
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:56,263
We'll meet 'em.
Out.

843
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:57,544
Let's go.

844
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,033
Look, Miss hayes,
I'm dumping $110 million

845
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:08,834
into one
of your communities.

846
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:11,517
The least I can get
is a little damn cooperation.

847
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:14,119
I have to let him run
his investigation.

848
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,441
Investigation?
Is that what you call it?

849
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,523
Because I'm up to my ears
in O.T. Pay.

850
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:20,205
I've got delays upon delays

851
00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:22,287
because my men won't come
to work.

852
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:25,009
<i>Now I don't care who's running
this investigation.</i>

853
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:27,852
I just don't want them running
my corporation into the ground

854
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:30,454
- while they do it.
- I understand.

855
00:54:30,454 --> 00:54:33,017
And I am more than sympathetic
to your position.

856
00:54:33,017 --> 00:54:36,380
However, I can't,
and I will not railroad
any officers

857
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,662
under my jurisdiction
to bend the law

858
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:40,584
to suit your financial needs.

859
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:43,146
Miss Hayes,
if I'm not mistaken,

860
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,068
Your term is up
in three months

861
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:47,390
<i>and you're seeking
re-election.</i>

862
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,752
I know this because a number
of people in your party

863
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:53,155
have contacted me regarding
substantial contributions.

864
00:54:53,155 --> 00:54:55,637
<i>Maybe they think
what I'm doing in your town</i>

865
00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:57,399
Is worth a little more
consideration

866
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:59,841
than I'm currently
being given.

867
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,803
Is that a threat,
Mr. Krantz?

868
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,525
Politics and favors
make wonderful bedfellows.

869
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:06,607
Do you understand
what I am talking about?

870
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:08,409
I understand this.

871
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:11,212
I will talk to Sheriff Evans
myself.

872
00:55:11,212 --> 00:55:13,974
You just better pray
that everything going on

873
00:55:13,974 --> 00:55:16,496
<i>at that worksite
is on the up and up.</i>

874
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:19,139
Do you understand
what I am talking about?

875
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:23,022
Good day, Mr. Krantz.

876
00:55:26,466 --> 00:55:28,908
Mr. Krantz,
we're here, sir.

877
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:43,802
- Where is it?
- This way, sir.

878
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,683
- Jimmy, you wait here.
- Yes, sir.

879
00:55:59,296 --> 00:56:01,898
Anybody else see this?

880
00:56:01,898 --> 00:56:04,260
No, I just uncovered
it myself.

881
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,982
I called you
as soon as I did.

882
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:09,425
I sent the other guys
to the main site as soon
as I saw it.

883
00:56:09,425 --> 00:56:12,508
How long do you estimate
it's been here?

884
00:56:12,508 --> 00:56:14,710
A hundred years,
maybe two.

885
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,272
Well, I don't care
how you do it,

886
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:20,555
but I want it gone,
you understand?

887
00:56:20,555 --> 00:56:23,438
Mr. Krantz, this is more
than just plowing under
some artifacts.

888
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:27,161
Pomeroy, do you
like your job?

889
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:29,444
Sir?

890
00:56:29,444 --> 00:56:31,325
You do as I tell you
and there's a nice bonus

891
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:34,208
in your next pay envelope,
okay?

892
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,292
- Mr. Krantz--
- No buts.

893
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:41,695
You bag up the bones
and get 'em off my property.
You got it?

894
00:56:44,257 --> 00:56:46,499
Got it, Mr. Krantz.

895
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:48,541
Good.

896
00:56:50,463 --> 00:56:53,386
Jimmy.

897
00:56:53,386 --> 00:56:55,708
<i>- We're out of here.
- Yes, sir.</i>

898
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:02,234
Copy. They're running
the plates right now, Sheriff,

899
00:57:02,234 --> 00:57:03,835
But this is Pomeroy's truck
all right.

900
00:57:03,835 --> 00:57:05,757
Yeah, I tried
to call his father

901
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:08,319
but the cell service
is dead out here.

902
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,722
Yeah, a 9mm
missing the clip.

903
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:14,245
- Looks like
more of the same, huh?
- Sure does.

904
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:16,006
What now, boss?

905
00:57:16,006 --> 00:57:18,128
I say we hitch a ride
back to our cars.

906
00:57:18,128 --> 00:57:20,971
I'll check in at the office.
You stop by the Pomeroy place.

907
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,612
- It's on the way.
- Roger.

908
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:31,140
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

909
00:57:40,028 --> 00:57:41,670
<i>( knocking )</i>

910
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:56,363
- Where's Storm Cloud?
- He is not to be disturbed.

911
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:58,245
- I will see him now.
- No!

912
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:01,128
He is on vision quest
seeking a way to undo the evil.

913
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:03,730
He can't do that!
That fool!

914
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:08,254
How dare you transgress
the prayers of a chief?

915
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,577
Have you forgotten
your place?

916
00:58:11,577 --> 00:58:14,780
I have no place
with cowards.

917
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:48,451
( siren wails )

918
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:50,773
Damn!

919
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:13,394
( exhales )

920
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:24,284
Hey, Mark, what's up?

921
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:26,126
I wasn't speeding,
not down that hill.

922
00:59:26,126 --> 00:59:28,448
No, Seth. No tickets today.
The Sheriff wanted me
to talk to you.

923
00:59:28,448 --> 00:59:30,009
Why, what's wrong?

924
00:59:30,009 --> 00:59:31,531
I'm wondering if you know
where Dex is right now.

925
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:33,052
No, what happened?

926
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:34,654
I found his truck
down by Pine Lake

927
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,375
This morning, abandoned,
no sign of him.

928
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:38,777
So what are we talking about,
another kidnapping?

929
00:59:38,777 --> 00:59:40,299
No, I can't be sure
of that.

930
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:43,742
I'm going right down there.
Where exactly is it?

931
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:45,944
I'd appreciate it
if you talked to
the Sheriff first.

932
00:59:45,944 --> 00:59:48,747
Mark, come on, please,
take me to where the truck is.

933
00:59:48,747 --> 00:59:50,228
<i>- ( rattling )
- What was that?</i>

934
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:58,676
Nothing.
I didn't hear anything.

935
00:59:59,917 --> 01:00:01,759
There it is again.

936
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,083
What you got in the bag,
Seth?

937
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:09,806
I, um...

938
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,129
Seth, what's in the bag?

939
01:00:17,773 --> 01:00:18,774
<i>( growling )</i>

940
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,302
Get in the truck!

941
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,362
What the hell
is that thing?

942
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:51,244
I don't know,

943
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:53,686
but it looks like
it's gonna take more than
bullets to kill it.

944
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:02,654
( gun clicks )

945
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,512
( gun clicks )

946
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,522
( screaming )

947
01:01:48,657 --> 01:01:50,018
Oh my god, no!

948
01:01:55,863 --> 01:01:57,785
( screaming )

949
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,352
- Hey, Steve.
- Jim.

950
01:02:05,352 --> 01:02:06,994
Any word on Lolli yet?

951
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:08,955
No, nothing yet.

952
01:02:08,955 --> 01:02:10,877
I checked with her mother
and some of her friends

953
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:14,160
and nobody's seen her
since yesterday.

954
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,962
How about Roberts?
He checked in yet?

955
01:02:15,962 --> 01:02:18,885
No, not a peep.
I'll try to raise him.

956
01:02:18,885 --> 01:02:22,127
Yeah, he's probably sleeping.
I could use some myself.

957
01:02:22,127 --> 01:02:24,610
Oh, Commissioner Hayes
called.

958
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,612
She said she wants
to talk to you right away.

959
01:02:26,612 --> 01:02:29,895
Oh, brother.
How'd she sound?

960
01:02:29,895 --> 01:02:31,977
Same as usual-- pissed.

961
01:02:31,977 --> 01:02:34,179
Yeah, get her on the line
for me, will you?

962
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,902
Yeah, sure.

963
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:43,147
This is Evans.

964
01:02:43,147 --> 01:02:46,990
Steve, Hayes. What the hell
is going on down there?

965
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:50,474
<i>What do you mean?</i>

966
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:53,636
I've got Richard Krantz making
a lot of noises up here

967
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:57,320
About some Indian uprising
against his new development
project.

968
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,242
That's not even close
to the truth.

969
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,123
He says the evidence
is overwhelming

970
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:03,325
and you've refused
to make any arrests.

971
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:06,929
Hell, I could go down there
right now and arrest
the whole damn tribe,

972
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:09,451
but that's not gonna stop
what's going on.

973
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:11,253
Well, it better stop soon.

974
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:13,695
There's a bank full of money
at stake here,

975
01:03:13,695 --> 01:03:15,376
not to mention
the political fallout

976
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,579
if this project isn't completed
on schedule.

977
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:21,982
And if you can't handle it,
the governor is gonna have
to send in the militia

978
01:03:21,982 --> 01:03:25,426
to keep the peace
and protect those workers.
Got it?

979
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,748
Yeah.

980
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:29,389
Yeah, I got it.

981
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:31,391
Good, keep me posted.

982
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:43,722
Hey, Steve.

983
01:03:43,722 --> 01:03:46,285
I tried Roberts twice
on his car radio,
still no answer.

984
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:48,767
Well, try his apartment.
If you get him,
you let me know.

985
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,249
Yeah, will do.

986
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:53,171
( panting )

987
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:55,133
Grandfather,
where are you going?

988
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:57,415
It is time.
I've seen the end.

989
01:03:57,415 --> 01:03:59,337
We must find the bone axe.

990
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,379
But it took many warriors
to destroy Torak.

991
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,821
Kaya, please.
There is no other way.

992
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:06,463
<i>- The beast must be stopped.
- No, not the Bone Eater.</i>

993
01:04:06,463 --> 01:04:08,986
There are too few
of you to defeat it.

994
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:11,788
I cannot undo
what has been done,

995
01:04:11,788 --> 01:04:13,790
<i>but I can
put a stop to it.</i>

996
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,072
Now please, Kaya.
Stay with the tribe.

997
01:04:16,072 --> 01:04:17,193
You'll be safe here.

998
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,449
Dad!

999
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:37,852
Dad, did you
find out anything?

1000
01:04:37,852 --> 01:04:39,774
No, nothing yet, Kel.

1001
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:42,376
Who would do such a thing?

1002
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:44,578
I don't know, honey.

1003
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:46,180
We can't assume
the worst yet.

1004
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,262
She is still
just a missing person.

1005
01:04:48,262 --> 01:04:51,024
They've had choppers
and search parties scouring
that area all day.

1006
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:53,386
If she's out there,
believe me, honey,
they'll find her.

1007
01:04:53,386 --> 01:04:56,029
Are you sure?

1008
01:04:56,029 --> 01:04:59,512
I promise.
I'm doing everything possible.

1009
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,675
<i>Burns to Evans.
Burns to Evans, come in.</i>

1010
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:04,357
What's up, Big Jim?

1011
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:07,680
I just got a call
from the emergency room
over at the trauma center.

1012
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,401
They found Mark

1013
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:12,164
<i>lying on the side
of the road up near
Whitney Portal.</i>

1014
01:05:12,164 --> 01:05:13,485
They're bringing him in
right now.

1015
01:05:13,485 --> 01:05:15,727
What's his condition?

1016
01:05:15,727 --> 01:05:18,730
Well, according to
the paramedics on the scene,
he's in pretty bad shape.

1017
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:20,451
They want you
over there pronto.

1018
01:05:20,451 --> 01:05:22,934
I'm on my way.

1019
01:05:22,934 --> 01:05:24,295
I'm coming with you.

1020
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,339
All right, all right,
jump in.

1021
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,872
Burns to Evans.
Burns to Evans,

1022
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,234
<i>Come in.</i>

1023
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:47,917
This is Evans,
go ahead.

1024
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:50,879
Steve, there's a woman here
from the reservation.

1025
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:54,443
She says that
it's imperative that she speak
with you immediately.

1026
01:05:54,443 --> 01:05:58,246
- What's her name?
- Kaya.

1027
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,129
Big Jim, tell her to meet me
at the hospital.

1028
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:06,093
<i>Steve:
Any idea what happened?</i>

1029
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:08,335
Based on his condition,

1030
01:06:08,335 --> 01:06:10,457
I'd say something outside
of the norm.

1031
01:06:10,457 --> 01:06:12,219
How so?

1032
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:16,062
Follow me.

1033
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:30,115
Look, honey,
why don't you go out
and wait in the hall

1034
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,758
While I talk
to the doc, okay?

1035
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:34,559
- Okay.
- All right.

1036
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:41,246
This one's got me stumped.

1037
01:06:43,287 --> 01:06:46,570
The bones in his right arm
and his right hand
are completely gone,

1038
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,973
resulting in this
fleshy mass.

1039
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:51,935
What could have done
something like this?

1040
01:06:51,935 --> 01:06:54,698
I'm just a country doctor.

1041
01:06:54,698 --> 01:06:55,979
<i>I'm not a specialist.</i>

1042
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:58,301
Can he talk?

1043
01:06:58,301 --> 01:07:00,263
Well, understandably,

1044
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:02,585
he's in shock.
I wouldn't bring him out.

1045
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:06,108
Well, did he say anything
when they picked him up?

1046
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:09,431
Yeah, the paramedics said

1047
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:12,314
that he was rambling on
about being attacked

1048
01:07:12,314 --> 01:07:15,277
by some giant

1049
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:16,718
skeleton-like creature.

1050
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:22,403
Obviously a delusion
from the pain.

1051
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:26,207
Yeah yeah, right.

1052
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,933
You take good care
of him, doc.

1053
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:34,414
What are you gonna do?

1054
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:39,499
I'm gonna try
to find that delusion.

1055
01:07:59,157 --> 01:08:02,760
I want six others to patrol
that south perimeter.

1056
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,563
You hear so much
as an owl fart,

1057
01:08:05,563 --> 01:08:07,925
you shoot first
and ask questions later.

1058
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:13,771
Mr. Krantz, we have
a problem at the main gate.

1059
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:16,213
- What?
- The Katonas.

1060
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:18,135
Son of a bitch!

1061
01:08:37,032 --> 01:08:39,995
We request peaceful access
to your property.

1062
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:41,436
<i>Krantz:
you're too late, chief.</i>

1063
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:43,998
You Katonas have
taken this situation

1064
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:46,000
way out of hand.

1065
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,843
It is you, Mr. Krantz,
that has broken this ground.

1066
01:08:48,843 --> 01:08:52,606
And it is you
that have uncovered these unholy
relics of our ancestors.

1067
01:08:52,606 --> 01:08:54,968
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1068
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:58,211
The bone axe.
It was here somewhere,
and we must find it.

1069
01:08:58,211 --> 01:09:00,133
You take one step
through that fence,

1070
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:02,615
the only thing you're
gonna find is hot lead.

1071
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:04,177
You understand me?

1072
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,941
<i>- ( shrieking )
- What the hell is that?</i>

1073
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:11,584
Get out.
Come on, get out of here!

1074
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:13,626
Come on, go!

1075
01:09:13,626 --> 01:09:16,828
Go now!
Go! Go!

1076
01:09:21,152 --> 01:09:23,675
( screaming )

1077
01:09:25,556 --> 01:09:27,558
Can't get it open.

1078
01:09:31,602 --> 01:09:34,885
( both scream )

1079
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:36,967
Jimmy, come on!

1080
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:38,769
Oh, god!

1081
01:09:38,769 --> 01:09:41,011
<i>No!</i>

1082
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,493
( both scream )

1083
01:09:45,134 --> 01:09:47,417
Dad, who would
do that to Mark?

1084
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:50,339
Well, if you believe
Storm Cloud, there's some
sort of weird creature

1085
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,301
running around the Indians
call the Bone Eater.

1086
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:54,303
You don't really
believe that.

1087
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,186
Well, something's going on,
and right now nothing
is making any sense.

1088
01:09:57,186 --> 01:09:59,147
- Steve!
- What are you doing here?

1089
01:09:59,147 --> 01:10:00,549
It's Storm Cloud.

1090
01:10:00,549 --> 01:10:02,550
What is it?

1091
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,552
He took some of
the tribe and he went
down to the worksite.

1092
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:06,874
Why?

1093
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:09,757
He's looking for
the sacred war axe.

1094
01:10:09,757 --> 01:10:13,440
Yeah, well,
all he's gonna find is trouble.

1095
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,923
<i>- You have to stop him.
- Burns to Evans,
Burns to Evans,</i>

1096
01:10:15,923 --> 01:10:17,044
<i>Come in, please.</i>

1097
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:21,648
This is Evans.
Go ahead, Jim.

1098
01:10:21,648 --> 01:10:24,451
Steve, I just got a call
from the Krantz site.

1099
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:27,974
They say they're surrounded
by Storm Cloud and his people.

1100
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,575
All right, I'm on it.

1101
01:10:29,575 --> 01:10:32,818
Kaya, take Kelly home
for me, will you?

1102
01:10:32,818 --> 01:10:34,980
I just hope I can get there
before it escalates.

1103
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:39,544
<i>( siren wailing )</i>

1104
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:46,110
What's the war axe
look like?

1105
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:49,514
It's an ancient Indian
weapon made with sections
of buffalo jaw,

1106
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:50,995
much like a tomahawk.

1107
01:10:50,995 --> 01:10:52,957
I just saw
a tomahawk last night

1108
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,678
in the back of
my boyfriend's truck.

1109
01:10:54,678 --> 01:10:56,720
- It was really old.
- Are you sure?

1110
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,123
I'm positive.
He said he just found it
lying around the impound lot.

1111
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:03,046
We gotta call him
right away.

1112
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:30,271
Storm Cloud?

1113
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:32,153
( chanting )

1114
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:35,956
Storm Cloud.

1115
01:11:35,956 --> 01:11:38,399
Go, Running Wolf.
Go now!

1116
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,080
I can't hold it
for very long.

1117
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,241
Hold what?

1118
01:12:16,113 --> 01:12:17,955
Sheriff, get in!
Get in!

1119
01:12:17,955 --> 01:12:19,076
Go! Go!

1120
01:12:22,999 --> 01:12:26,403
( roars )

1121
01:12:26,403 --> 01:12:28,124
Sheriff, what the hell
was that thing?

1122
01:12:28,124 --> 01:12:31,527
Something I've got
to stop before tomorrow.
That I can tell you.

1123
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,449
You mind telling me
how you plan to do that?

1124
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,451
You just let me
figure it out.

1125
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:38,053
I appreciate the lift,
though.

1126
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,575
Yeah, no problem.

1127
01:12:39,575 --> 01:12:40,936
What the hell were you
doing out here anyway?

1128
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:43,939
Kelly called me
on my cell phone.

1129
01:12:43,939 --> 01:12:46,781
She wanted me
to give you this.

1130
01:12:46,781 --> 01:12:49,304
I found it yesterday
in the impound yard.

1131
01:12:49,304 --> 01:12:53,027
She said for you
to take Storm Cloud
to the reservation,

1132
01:12:53,027 --> 01:12:54,669
Said that he would know
what to do with it.

1133
01:12:54,669 --> 01:12:56,670
Yeah, well...

1134
01:12:58,632 --> 01:13:00,474
Storm cloud
didn't make it.

1135
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:07,000
Sheriff, no offense,
but I really think

1136
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,162
that you need to call
the Army or the FBI.

1137
01:13:09,162 --> 01:13:11,324
They won't believe it.

1138
01:13:11,324 --> 01:13:14,927
By the time they
decide this thing is real,
it'll already be too late.

1139
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:18,170
All right.
What are you gonna
do about it?

1140
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,852
I want you to drop me off
at the reservation.

1141
01:13:19,852 --> 01:13:22,254
Then I want you
to head back to town.

1142
01:13:22,254 --> 01:13:24,256
You get Kelly
and her friend Kaya.

1143
01:13:24,256 --> 01:13:26,097
<i>You wake 'em up
if you have to,</i>

1144
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:29,220
but I want the three of you
as far from Sweetwater
as possible by sunrise.

1145
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,062
All right.

1146
01:13:31,062 --> 01:13:33,384
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1147
01:13:33,384 --> 01:13:36,267
Mike, you gotta be
miles away from here

1148
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:38,189
before that eclipse tomorrow.
You got it?

1149
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,552
Yes, sir.

1150
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:48,758
So what's the deal
with this weapon?

1151
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,920
It's the key to stopping
all the evil.

1152
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,922
<i>- How?
- ( horn honking )</i>

1153
01:13:52,922 --> 01:13:54,724
Come, we must go.
I'll tell you on the way.

1154
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:05,133
Mike, what is going on?
Where's my father?

1155
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:07,896
Your father's all right.
He went up to the reservation
to get something.

1156
01:14:07,896 --> 01:14:09,577
He went with
Storm Cloud?

1157
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:11,980
The Sheriff said
Storm Cloud didn't make it.

1158
01:14:13,461 --> 01:14:15,983
Oh my god,
Kaya, I'm so sorry.

1159
01:14:15,983 --> 01:14:18,385
Ladies, listen,
the sun's gonna be up soon.

1160
01:14:18,385 --> 01:14:20,387
We gotta be out of here
before the eclipse, okay?

1161
01:14:20,387 --> 01:14:22,429
I'm not leaving
without my father.

1162
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:24,191
Kelly, the last thing
that your father said to me

1163
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:25,792
was "get my daughter
and get her out of town

1164
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:27,194
and don't let her
talk you out of it."

1165
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:29,075
- No, but--
- No, there's gonna
be no talking.

1166
01:14:29,075 --> 01:14:30,717
Get in the truck right now.
Both of you, come on.

1167
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:57,461
I see you're finding
your Katona roots.

1168
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:09,272
Put the knife down.

1169
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:11,434
Put the axe down first.

1170
01:15:11,434 --> 01:15:13,796
I can't do that.

1171
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,281
I said,

1172
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,923
Put the knife down now.

1173
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,973
Whatever you say,
Sheriff.

1174
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,981
What's the matter?

1175
01:15:40,981 --> 01:15:42,903
You get soft doing
the white man's bidding, huh?

1176
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:03,162
( yells )

1177
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:06,685
( grunts )

1178
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,852
May your soul find peace.

1179
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:54,489
Hyaa!
Hyaa!

1180
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,451
( horse whinnies )

1181
01:17:29,761 --> 01:17:31,963
It's getting darker.

1182
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:34,325
Yeah.

1183
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:37,048
It's starting.

1184
01:17:46,577 --> 01:17:48,418

Dad!

01:20:04,904 --> 01:20:07,146
Baby.

1192
01:20:07,146 --> 01:20:09,108
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1193
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:12,150
- All right?
- Yeah.

1194
01:20:17,636 --> 01:20:21,439
Welcome back to the tribe,
Running Wolf.

1195
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:23,007
