00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:10,375

Every eve of every hallow.

00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,346
<i>High time we made a stand.</i>

4
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,079
<i>And shook up the views
of the common man.</i>

5
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,121
<i>The love train rides
from coast to coast.</i>

6
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,861
<i>D.J.'s the man we love the most.</i>

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,690
<i>Could you be,
could you be squeaky clean'?</i>

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,457
- <i>And smash any hope of democracy?</i>
- <i>Hello?</i>

00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,260
<i>As the headline says
you're free to choose.</i>

<i>One of these days they're gonna call it
the blues, yeah, yeah</i>

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,811
(singing) Sowing the seeds
of love, the seeds of love,

13
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,546
sowing the seeds of...

14
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,754
Hello?

15
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,823
Well, in view of the
fact that there is no one

16
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,622
here to seek payment for
this delectable frosty treat...

17
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,831
- Oh, my gosh!
- Ah“

18
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,433
I am so sorry!
Have you been waiting long?

19
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,796
Oh, no. I actually...

20
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,596
I had like a gallon of pink
lemonade before my shift

21
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,809
and I knew I had to wee,
but I couldn't because

22
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,704
I couldn't be late
and I'm a professional.

23
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,134
But it was an emergency and
now my life is in your hands

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,481
and we do have a half bath and
we tell everybody that we don't.

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,119
We lie, but we do.
We have a commode and a sink.

26
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,452
Would you like to
fill out a gripe report?

27
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:32,858
Yes. No! No! No!
I don't have any gripes.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,656
- No, your...
- Oh! (Giggles)

29
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,925
Hey, your... your secret
is safe with me, Miss, um...

30
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,300
Goolsby, Miss Bethany Lynne
Goolsby from Haddonfield.

31
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:47,171
Well, Miss Bethany Lynne
Goolsby from Haddonsfield,

32
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:51,473
I say that we put this
whole thing behind us

33
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,380
and we pretend like
it never happened.

34
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,320
You're nice!

35
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,957
When you were born,
what name were you given?

36
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,628
- Anson.
- Anson, like Manson.

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,660
- Well, yeah, sort of.
- That was weird.

38
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,128
- They totally rhymed.
- It does rhyme.

39
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,801
It totally rhymes.

40
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,903
Well, will that be all
for you tonight, Anson?

41
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:23,880
Um, yep. Oh, no. Oh, uh, yeah.
Save a tree. (Chuckles)

42
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,145
That's so nice!
I frickin' love sorbet!

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,584
I frickin' love it too!
It fully cleanses my palate.

44
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,190
- Yeah.
- Oh, um...

45
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,754
Don't. Don't. I'm gonna...

46
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,158
I'm gonna give it
to you for free.

47
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,562
- Hmm?
- I'm gonna give it to you for free.

48
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,600
Can you hear what I'm saying?

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,771
I'm gonna give
it to you for free.

50
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:52,169
Oh. (Chuckles) Well, thank you.

51
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,434
Oh, you're welcome.

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,702
- (chuckles) Milady.
- (Chuckles) Oh.

53
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,745
(hums trumpet sounds)

54
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,781
Oh, come back after the winter
when you've found food for us!

55
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,851
(laughs) I have found food!

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,078
(laughs) Let's eat it!

57
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,552
I have been hunting
and gathering at once!

58
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,692
I do all the jobs out there.
(laughs)

59
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,759
'Cause I have a
big steed that I ride.

60
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,055
Oh, it's hard to get your
horse to go in circles.

61
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,888
(vocalizing nonsense
instrumental sounds)

62
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,198
(mimicking Anson's nonsense
instrumental sounds)

63
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,896
(singing nonsensically)
I've always wanted to dance a jig!

64
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,906
You seem like
you could teach a jig.

65
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,111
Well, I was just being honest.

66
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,787
Never mind.

67
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,387
You can tell me anything.
I hope you know that.

68
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,928
Um, okay, would it be weird if
I came and visited you sometime?

69
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,100
Eh, no, not under any
circumstances would it be weird.

70
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,825
It would be,
it would be perfectly yes.

71
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:59,574
Happy Halloween,
Miss Bethany Lynne Goolsby.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,576
Happy Halloween,
Anson like Manson.

73
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,106
<i>(music playing) Open hearts.</i>

74
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,013
<i>Feel about it.</i>

75
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,620
<i>Open minds.</i>

76
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,689
<i>Think about it.</i>

77
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,326
<i>Everyone.</i>

78
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,928
<i>Read about it.</i>

79
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,759
<i>Everyone.</i>

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,299
<i>Scream about it.</i>

81
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,833
<i>Everyone.</i>

82
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,437
<i>Everyone.</i>

83
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,665
<i>Yeah.</i>

84
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,809
- Everyone.
- (Laughs)

85
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,480
<i>Read about it, read about h.</i>

86
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:42,153
<i>Read in the books in the crannies
and the nooks there are books to read.</i>

87
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:54,131

- <i>Sowing the seeds of love.</i>

88
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,198
<i>We're</i> sowing the seeds.

89
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,529
<i>Sowing the seeds...</i>

90
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,470
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Well, is there a list?

91
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,082
List! Yes, it does matter.

92
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,780
Because it's fucking
freezing outside

93
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,079
and I'm wearing this
ass-tastic peach melba

94
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,881
fit & flare number, Heather.
Be part of the solution.

95
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,990
No way! If I wear a jacket,
I might as well not even

96
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,388
be wearing a costume, okay?

97
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,858
I'm not an Inuit, and plus,
my nipples are poking out

98
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,660
like little Patriot missiles and
that's the fire starter, hmm?

99
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,771
(coughs) Fuck, dude!
It's so cold!

100
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,736
I, like, can't even inhale.
Fuck.

101
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,570
But I thought you
were all over this.

102
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,580
Well, good, because
I can't do everything

103
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,285
while I'm toiling
like a white slave.

104
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,020
(groans)

105
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,747
This godforsaken fish tank
is gonna be the death of me.

106
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,357
(under breath) Dumb bitch.

107
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,893
Because I have to clean
the fish poo, Heather!

108
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,293
Yep, I'm a cock-teasing,
fish poo cleaning...

109
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,727
Oop, shit. (Laughs)

110
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,962
Junior college party-crashing
little diva bitty, and so are you.

111
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:13,200
Hey, we better be on
that fucking list. Jesus.

112
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,255
Revisionist history:
The illegitimate distortion

113
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,889
of the historical record says
that certain events appear

114
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,923
- in a more favorable light.
- Oh, but surely you make jest.

115
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,993
Napoleon was one of the greatest

116
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,062
military strategists the
world has ever known.

117
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,964
His codes were infamous!
The Army of Portugal cipher.

118
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,638
Bitch, my cousin Deandre
don't even have his GED

119
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,604
and even he can figure out
the Army of Portugal cipher!

120
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,902
It was just a bunch of
missin' letters.

121
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,271
Everybody know that!

122
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,078
(music playing)

123
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,990
<i>Hmm.</i>

124
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,193
Okay-

125
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,345
(distant cheering)

126
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,552
(boxing announcer
speaking Spanish)

127
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,058
(thwacking)

128
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,793
(thud, man grunts)

129
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,229
(crowd cheering, bell rings)

130
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,526
Nice.

131
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,034
That's right.
Ain't no holes in my game, son.

132
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,470
Little Georgie shoved his whole
arm up your boy's ass and said,

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,409
"Hey, everybody, this is Nappy.
He's my bitch."

134
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,308
"You got any bright
ideas, Nappy?"

135
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,644
"Eh, eh, eh, eh.

136
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,049
Oui! Let's go to Egypt!
I want those pyramids!"

137
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,848
George Scovell was lucky.

138
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,591
He was a showboat
and a nincompoop!

139
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,996
- You a damn nincompoop.
- You're a nincompoop!

140
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,828
- You're a nincompoop!
- You are a nincompoop!

141
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,365
You're right.

142
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,438
I am a nincompoop.

143
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,606
- Respect!
- Respect.

144
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,905
You are going to ace this test.

145
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,515
From your lips to
God's ears, my brother.

146
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:39,586
Bert, hello. Time to get up.
Time to go home.

147
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,522
My phone is dead.

148
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,891
Possibly because I left about

149
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,400
17 longwinded-ish messages

150
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,631
for my, uh, my angel.

151
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,878
I thought...

152
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,783
You know what? I'm good.

153
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,115
- I'm an oak.
- You are an oak.

154
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,586
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
I'm gonna clean it up.

155
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,454
I am nobody's jerk, so...

156
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,891
Absolutely not.

157
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,431
Please be careful
going up the stairs.

158
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,126
You're an oak. Tiptop.
Use the railing.

159
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,598
God.

160
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:36,143
Yeah! He's had a rough night,
wearing that.

161
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,437
Oh, my God.

162
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,812
I cannot believe he proposed
here, like, that's so shitty.

163
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,611
Got down on one
knee and everything.

164
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,153
Had me float the ring
in a ginger margarita.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,860
Tequila shot?
(squeaky voice) Pretty please?

166
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,303
(Cricket): You're gonna
miss the shit out of me.

167
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,166
(Kerry): This is true.
What am I gonna do without you?

168
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,178
Yo, that shit's nasty.
Where's Julio?

169
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,600
He drove Melissa to the
hospital after her water broke.

170
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,654
That hooker was walking
with some quesadillas

171
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,356
and her shit just
started cascading

172
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,172
- down her legs onto the carpet.
- (Chuckles) She's not a hooker.

173
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,454
Then she should be.
The bar empty or what?

174
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,686
No, not yet.

175
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,633
Well, I ain't gonna
be here all damn night.

176
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,735
I'm gonna go out and
get me some candy and nuts.

177
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,402
Wink, what'd you
lock the door for?

178
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,865
I ain't locked shit.

179
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,970
- Well, it won't open.
- So?

180
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,336
So, it has ceased to serve
its purpose as a door.

181
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,307
Then don't think of it as one!

182
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,676
Damn. Fuck outta my face.

183
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,680
Oh, hell, yeah!
Genghis motherfuckin' Khan.

184
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,545
It's true.
At least here I have you guys.

185
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,517
- We're in the trenches together.
- Oh, fuck off!

186
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,589
You think any of us actually
want to be here? Okay, stop.

187
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:00,388
This is still all about king of
the dipshits, and I've had it.

188
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,758
He was a loser. Seriously.

189
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,524
You are better off without
him and you know it.

190
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,328
You're gonna end up with
some gorgeous doctor

191
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,267
with a huge dong
and a Range Rover.

192
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,406
I refuse to feel sorry for you.

193
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,281
Winketta, do me a favor.

194
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,779
Stop eating for a second,
go check the floor,

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,077
and bring Kerry
and Cricket with you.

196
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,263
- Mmm. What's this?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh! Uh-uh. No, no.

197
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,856
You can't give a sista
a little baby piece?

198
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,855
Nobody gets any until
Kerry comes back here.

199
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,002
We're all gonna get together
and we're gonna sing.

200
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,964
"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow"
and next week when you graduate

201
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,860
we're gonna do the same
thing for you, senorita.

202
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,296
All right.

203
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,868
I'll bring her ass back here,
but I ain't singin' shit.

204
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,937
And y'all better not touch
my nachos neither!

205
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,301
Your nachos are safe.
Now go on.

206
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,112
I don't understand this thing.
It's not even locked!

207
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,371
That's what I was sayin', homes.

208
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,140
- What'd I tell you about that?
- What?

209
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,283
Going around calling people
"homes" and "esse."

210
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,918
You said I should
grow my lexicon.

211
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,744
I said, be the Mexi-con
with the lexicon!

212
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,032
Now where is the disconnect?

213
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,784
Well, I didn't have any idea
what you were talking about

214
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,088
to tell you the truth,
but now I think I understand.

215
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,128
- Do you?
- Yeah.

216
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,762
- Do you really?
- Yeah.

217
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,307
Because if you're
just saying that

218
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,267
and you're still
harboring confusion

219
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,969
'cause all you think
about is ass...

220
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,466
Tio Chuy. I got you, man.

221
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,298
And I'm gonna be a
pugilist and a gentleman.

222
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,634
One of the two wouldn't be bad.

223
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,811
Is there a shade
past blue balls?

224
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,982
- Stop.
- Yo. Chuy needs y'all in the back.

225
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,912
- Check this out.
- Check what out?

226
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,247
Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the show.

227
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,854
(laughs) Oh, no, they ain't.

228
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,750
- (laughs)
- (Laughs)

229
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:39,191
Oh, goddamn! Hey!
Y'all need to break it up!

230
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,329
You think this thing
is a Ramada?

231
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,467
I'm sorry, are you
trying to close or something?

232
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,829
Fool, we've been closed
for half an hour now.

233
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,335
Y'all need to get your asses up
and get to a Ramada, stat!

234
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,040
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

235
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,971
We just couldn't seem to help
ourselves, Halloween and all.

236
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,146
Come here. Mm m!

237
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,842
You are the dirtiest
pussy I've ever seen.

238
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,348
Y'all need to skedaddle, now!

239
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,145
Okay-

240
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,221
I fucking told you!

241
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,890
Fucking blue suit!

242
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:17,658
(crying) Emo! What's an Emo?

243
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,733
<i>(subs)</i>

244
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,634
Is this what I think it is?

245
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,317
<i>Fuck, Bert.</i>

246
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,556
(singing in Hebrew)

247
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,691
I'm leaving you for Jez.

248
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,024
- (sighs)
- She's an emo.

249
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,166
She plays in a Siouxie and the
Banshees cover band.

250
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,063
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,406
(gulps)

252
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,348
Okay, now.

253
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,611
(chuckles) Oh, you guys!
I can't believe this!

254
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,017
I've never seen frosting
on flan before. (Laughs)

255
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,193
You need to pull yourself together
and cut this custard, girl.

256
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,123
Chuy, this is too much.

257
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,022
We know that
you will be fulfilling

258
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,460
your dream of
helping those in need.

259
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,066
Now, that's hardly a
surprise from all of us

260
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,361
who've gotten to know you

261
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,072
and are lucky enough to
call you friend.

262
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,435
Oh. Aww.

263
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,271
- This is from all of us.
- No...

264
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,118
Oh, thank you so much!

265
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,617
I love it! It's perfect!
Thank you.

266
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,199
Oh, no, no.
Wait, wait, everybody.

267
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:51,217
Okay, on three, okay?
One, two, three.

268
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,897
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow,</i>

269
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,964
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow,
for she's...</i>

270
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,760
- (crying)
- (Music playing)

271
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,498
<i>I</i> like roosters, how 'bout you?

272
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,302
<i>I like pigs and donkeys, too.</i>

273
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,015
<i>I like cows and I like hens.</i>

274
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,741
<i>I like farm animal friends.</i>

275
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,979
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

276
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,316
<i>Go, snort, snort, hee-haw.</i>

277
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,185
<i>Cock-a-doodle doo!</i>

278
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,328
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

279
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,827
<i>Go, snort, snort, hee-haw.</i>

280
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,499
<i>Cock-a-doodle doo!</i>

281
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,828
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

282
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,132
<i>Farm animal, farm,
farm animal friends.</i>

283
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,368
<i>Farm animal friends.</i>

284
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:45,776
<i>Farm animal, farm,
farm animal friends.</i>

285
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:54,323
<i>I like farm animal friends.</i>

286
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,028
Winkie.
Something's blocking this door.

287
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,290
Uh, go around.

288
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,333
I need you to find out
what that is, please.

289
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
Hell no.
My bunions is all flared up.

290
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,809
Come on, Winketta.
You can walk me to my car on the way.

291
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,410
The freaks are out tonight
and I am a tiny white

292
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,079
ice princess with natural boobs.

293
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,807
Oh! My pinky toe's all mashed
up against my finger toe.

294
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,218
Hey! Yeah, I'm leaving
right now, you concubine.

295
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,084
Oh, my God, Heather!

296
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,555
I'm sorry, I'm being a what?
Shut...

297
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,058
Heather, did you just
hang up on me?

298
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,493
Do you smell something burning?

299
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,665
(buzzing and crackling)

300
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,939
(whistling, chuckling)

301
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,205
What in the...

302
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,680
Hey, Cricket, tell Chuy to
call the fuzz!

303
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:01,051
Aloha! Holy shit! Mamacita!
No need to be alarmed.

304
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,624
I took metal shop in
high school and, uh,

305
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,227
I know what I'm doing
for the most part.

306
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,692
Which is what?

307
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,527
Well, I just welded this
here door shut from the inside.

308
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,634
Cricket!
Cricket, where are you, girl?

309
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,874
Cricket, where are you, girl?
I think she's over there.

310
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,575
Whoop! Eleven o'clock.

311
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,773
Yo!

312
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,079
(gags)

313
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,115
We don't need another hero.

314
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,581
I got combat skills, bitch.

315
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,881
Now, I do not doubt that.
What is your name, please?

316
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
Fuck you! Let her go!

317
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,420
Tell me your name or
I'll be forced to call you Roz.

318
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,849
Dude, you just
totally read my mind.

319
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,588
Speaking of which,
what the hell happened

320
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,628
to Harry Anderson
after "Night Court"?

321
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,831
Live shows in Vegas.

322
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,399
His seats sell faster
than Love and 0.

323
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,502
Well, suit yourself, Roz.
I'm Stef.

324
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,502
The, uh, welding bandit bozo
over there is my brother Anson,

325
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,640
and the lovely pussycat
behind you is Mimi,

326
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,809
the future mother
of my Hello Kitties.

327
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:02,309
Meow.
Now back that thing up, bitch.

328
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,784
(singing nonsensically)

329
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,233
Ah, time for the
backdoor, please?

330
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,191
Maybe nine minutes.

331
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,688
Front door's eleven and change.

332
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,624
You've really become an
accomplished welderman.

333
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,072
Thanks, bro. I'll be able to
un-weld that in half the time.

334
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,193
- Cha-ching.
- That's a hilariously small cowboy hat

335
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,435
you have on your head there,
my friend.

336
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,640
It was a game-time decision.
Sometimes less is more.

337
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,705
- Agreed.
- I think you look ridiculous.

338
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:25,942
Shh.

339
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,726
You know what, Mimi?
You're a cat, okay?

340
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,277
You're a frickin' black cat.
Don't judge me.

341
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,777
Opel'! Up, please.

342
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,280
You're not putting that orange
in my mouth, motherfucker.

343
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,455
First of all, it's a tangelo
and it's in season. Secondly...

344
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,124
- (grunts)
- So far, so pretty, you guys-

345
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,325
What do you say we
head back to the kitchen

346
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,526
and round up the troops?

347
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,063
You guys stay here
and get comfy.

348
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,086
(Anson): You know,
I think a bandit clown

349
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,062
with a big ax is pretty creepy.
It's called counterpoint.

350
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,301
(Stef): Plus the
beard adds nuance.

351
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,131
(Mimi): You are so insecure,
Anson, it's revolting.

352
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,136
Was anyone talking to you, Mimi?
No.

353
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,865
- (Mimi laughs)
- Fuck.

354
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,888
(Anson): Ladies and gentlemen,
do not be alarmed.

355
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,243
- No one will be hurt.
- (Chuy): What are you doing?

356
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,849
- (shouts in French)
- Some kind of joke? Come on, hey.

357
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,749
(all shouting)

358
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:23,190
(Stef): Everyone, thank you!
Splendid.

359
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,096
We're about to
have a lot of fun.

360
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,748
(microphone feedback)

361
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,170
- Lads and lasses.
- Overkill.

362
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,586
Yep. Here's the skinny.

363
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,793
We have got a variety

364
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,850
of wacky activities
on the docket for tonight,

365
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,420
but the clock is already ticking
so we are gonna need your

366
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,223
full cooperation if
we are gonna pull

367
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,900
this shindig off in a funky way.

368
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,128
Now, we'd be willing to pull
the fruits from your mugs

369
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,397
if you could follow one
simple rule. Hush it up!

370
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,735
Or I'll be forced to
stab you in the liver

371
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,968
with a Flintstone-sized
beef skewer.

372
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,578
Now, what was the rule?

373
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,246
Don't be shy.
Let me hear it. Please.

374
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:20,116
(overlapping dialogue)

375
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:27,627
Outstanding, you guys.
That was really, really good.

376
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:28,831
Moving on.

377
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,249
You should all know that the
phone lines have been cut,

378
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,191
the front and back doors
have been welded shut

379
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,052
and as most of you already
know, I presume...

380
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,664
there are no windows
in this cantina pequita.

381
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,603
So basically what
I'm telling you here

382
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,675
is that the stage
has clearly been set

383
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,607
for an old-school
pseudo-European

384
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,440
gangster-style slumber party.

385
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,777
Lady lumps,
have you collected the mobiles?

386
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,954
Hey, Siri.

387
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,090
(iPhone beeping)

388
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,485
Guess she couldn't swim.

389
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,352
You are a cheeky minx.

390
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,594
I thought you'd like that shit.

391
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,297
I do. I do, baby.

392
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,519
<i>Uh, pardon me, per favor.</i>

393
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,530
Uh, I'm the manager here
and now I know you said not to,

394
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,870
uh, speak or else you'd
stab me in the kidney, but...

395
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,332
Kidney, he said.

396
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,041
Well, (sighs) I'm willing to
give you every red cent

397
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,472
the joint has if you just
let my employees go.

398
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,339
Let my people go-

399
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,207
- Go.
- What are you doing?

400
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,471
Let me handle this, mija.

401
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,050
We're not leaving you here.
No way.

402
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,618
Fuck that! I ain't going anywhere
without you, Uncle Chuy.

403
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,687
<i>Mi madre es tu hermana, vato.</i>

404
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,687
Probably be in jail
if it wasn't for you

405
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,450
and the songs of Rubén Blades.

406
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,822
You believed in me
when no one else would.

407
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,623
I will not abandon you in this,
your darkest hour.

408
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,027
- Our darkest hour.
- Shh!

409
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,962
Oh, wait. I'm aces.
Sorry. Never mind.

410
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,171
Listen, you're all
very, very sweet

411
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,804
and I appreciate that and that's

412
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,666
one of the reasons
why I hired you,

413
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,503
but it only takes one
of us to open the safe

414
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,974
and I'm the only one
who has the combination.

415
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,180
That's not true.
I know the combination.

416
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,643
No, you don't!

417
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,215
- I too know the combination.
- Please don't do this.

418
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,044
Yo. I could crack that remedial
shit with my eyes closed.

419
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,755
Oh, hell no.
All y'all is crazy.

420
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,184
- Hey. Hey, hi!
- Hi.

421
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,017
Look, you got all the
people you need.

422
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,195
So why don't you just
un-weld one of them doors

423
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,897
and let a sister
catch the next Metro?

424
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,688
- Wink.
- What?

425
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:09,899
Wait. Why did they weld
the doors shut?

426
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,276
Why does anyone do anything?

427
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,997
Come in, grab the cash,
make a quick exit.

428
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,569
- Isn't that the drill?
- In my experience, yeah.

429
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,028
So why the pseudo-European
gangster-style slumber party?

430
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,197
- Why pseudo?
- Seriously.

431
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,534
Like we're not good
enough for the real thing?

432
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,835
What is the real thing?

433
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,867
Why haven't they asked
about the safe already?

434
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,748
Because these cabrones aren't
planning a robbery, are you?

435
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,043
Oh, hell no!

436
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,186
- You guys are adorable.
- (Chuckles)

437
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,549
I mean, the no-talking rule went
out the window in a huge way,

438
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,626
but you're an intuitive bunch.
I like that.

439
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,364
And does this feel
like a robbery to you?

440
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,769
(groaning)

441
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:03,284
Does this smell like
a robbery to you?

442
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,791
Honestly, it's not like
anyone pays with cash

443
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,833
anymore anyway these days.

444
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,604
. Stop it! - (Sobbing)

445
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,807
What the hell do
you want with us?

446
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,379
We want everything.
The whole chimichanga.

447
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,343
And a little bit of pageantry.

448
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,118
You're gonna kill us?

449
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,979
Big picture?
Yes, that's a given.

450
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,188
No, man.

451
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,045
I should've known
your nasty pasty asses,

452
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,558
comin' in here
dry humpin' and shit!

453
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,452
- No, man! No way.
- I get it.

454
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,492
- Please! Gringo loco.
- I get it.

455
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:24,167
So y'all is some punk-ass
crazy-eyed killers, huh?

456
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,200
Okay then. Come at me.
Come at a sista.

457
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,063
'Cause I swear on my
grandmama's grave

458
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,569
that I ain't goin' out
without a motherfuckin' fight.

459
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,968
You hear me?

460
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,077
I'mma be throwin' some haymakers
and some kung-fu style elbows,

461
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,615
'cause I don't play these games!

462
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,206
This is some sick
white-people-only shit.

463
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,043
What the fuck are y'all doin'
lickin' and sniff in' on folks?

464
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,811
The fuck? You really startin' to bug!
Come get me! What...

465
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:51,427
Roz! If you don't pipe down,
you're gonna lose your voice.

466
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,661
Bitch! Hooker, please!

467
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,195
Bitch, if you find some
goddamn needle and thread

468
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,560
and sew my shit shut,
I'm still gonna talk at you!

469
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:58,767
You hear me?

470
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,004
And you're gonna hear me
loud and goddamn clear!

471
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,426
I will find you in your dreams

472
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,667
and I will hate-fuck you,
Amazon bitch!

473
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,934
Get off me, ho!
Don't touch me, ho!

474
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,611
Get off me, ho!
I will sweat insults, bitch,

475
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,575
if you don't stop
fuckin' touchin' me!

476
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,077
Get off me...

477
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,520
<i>,</i> (Screams) - Oh!

478
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,717
Oh, shit! Oh! Puta madre!

479
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,389
(groaning)

480
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,867
Well, what the fuck
is this move?

481
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,468
(sobbing)

482
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,070
Hey, babe.
I bit out Roz's voice box.

483
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,936
- You did.
- Not much of a box now.

484
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,979
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, man.

485
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,272
<i>Mmm.</i>

486
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,714
Okay. What the hell?
The cat's already out of the sack.

487
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,150
We're gonna eat you guys.
All of you.

488
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,050
The raw, the cooked,
one at a time until

489
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,317
we are <i>so</i> stuffed
we can barely move

490
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,290
because that's who we are.

491
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,394
And tonight's the night we
feast it up banquet style.

492
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,598
It's our tradition!

493
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,995
Every eve of every hallow.

494
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,238
- Sorry.
- Yeah, we're gonna clown around, uh,

495
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,580
and we're gonna come up
with names for... for every...

496
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,664
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

497
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,671
- ...every course...
- Yeah.

498
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,276
- ...based on who's in them.
- Like, uh, holy mole.

499
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,480
- Right.
- Yeah.

500
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,771
- Right. You know what? Maybe a...
- Psst.

501
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,642
- ...maybe a simple heads-up...
- Shh.

502
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,681
Next time before you decide to
grossly break protocol like that, huh?

503
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:23,976
Do what?

504
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,813
I'm fairly certain that
what you did constitutes

505
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,955
nibbling on the living, and that is...
...that is not what we're about.

506
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,284
We have a mission statement,
we have integrity.

507
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,256
Oh, what's the big fucking deal?

508
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,861
We were gonna turn
her into stew anyway.

509
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,359
She wasn't gonna shut up, so...

510
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,625
Stef?

511
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,815
Ah, why don't we shelve
this 'til later, you guys?

512
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:39,924
Hal Naturally. (Chuckles)

513
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,536
Rules are made to be broken.

514
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,204
You stole my
favorite line, okay?

515
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:44,583
"Every eve of every hallow."

516
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,707
I say that. That's my line.
I say it every year.

517
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,943
Stef, will you tell her?

518
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,888
- You took his line, hon, you did take...
- Because I don't have any!

519
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:56,012
You have to help Winketta.
She'll bleed to death. Please!

520
00:27:56,275 --> 00:28:00,189
That is a truly ugly picture.
Pennywise, please patch her up.

521
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,550
I doubt she'll be available
for the second half,

522
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,020
though, FY to the I.

523
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,728
- Sorry, Roz.
- (Hiccups)

524
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,988
It wasn't supposed to be a
frickin' cannibal holocaust.

525
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,791
Just try to find
your happy place.

526
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,001
(gassing)

527
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:17,037
(sighs) Now, Spartacus, about
your request to let the pups go.

528
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,866
You're a leader.
You know what I mean?

529
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,077
You lead.
Any fool can see that.

530
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,835
You have the respect and
admiration of your employees

531
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,672
and that is something
that I appreciate,

532
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,905
but it's that same sense
of loyalty and sacrifice

533
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,310
that makes me a
little bit skittish, Chu.

534
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,746
Hmm? Leadership intangibles.

535
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,919
Exactly. It's like having
Gladys Knight or Edie Brickell

536
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,316
- under center for the opposing squad.
- Ah, sports!

537
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,153
But I'm also a sucker
for a feel-good ending.

538
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,726
Remember "Old Yeller"?

539
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,862
(gagging) ' Anyone?

540
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:47,400
- (gassing)
- Okay. (Exhales)

541
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,603
What are you doing?

542
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,034
I'm giving Papa Smurf a
chance to save the village.

543
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,879
Did you ever play William Tell
as a little bandito, Chuy?

544
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,843
No, it was mostly
cowboys and Indians.

545
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,017
Oh, I bet you made a precious
little Injun boy, didn't you?

546
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,776
- I was a cowboy!
- Hmm. Progressive.

547
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,019
Not really.

548
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,688
There were no white kids
in the neighborhood

549
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,671
so we all got to be
whatever we wanted to be.

550
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,623
Well, today,
I'm going to be William Tell

551
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,887
and you'll be my one and
only son, Willie, Jr. (sighs)

552
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,600
If I can hit the tangelo
off the top of your head,

553
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,616
- I'll let your people go.
- And if you miss?

554
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,569
You know, I had you pegged
as a glass-half-full kind of guy.

555
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,705
- (sighs)
- Anson, my kin.

556
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,704
(whistling)

557
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,412
No, no, no, Uncle Chuy.
Don't, man.

558
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:32,081
- (singing nonsensically)
- You don't gotta do this! Come on!

559
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,282
(singing nonsensically)

560
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,779
No, tio, no.
You don't gotta do this, tio!

561
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,317
Ah. (Sighs) All right.

562
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,716
(making propeller sounds)
Here comes the airplane.

563
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,119
Open wide.
(making propeller sounds)

564
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,659
- Ah. Atta boy.
- I can't overemphasize the need

565
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,296
for you to remain
completely still.

566
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:54,333
Whoa. Hey, buddy,
you are so hardcore right now.

567
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:59,736
Yikes. All right, brother.
All set. Let's do it.

568
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,808
(all groaning)

569
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,848
Let 'er rip, babe.

570
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,922
(music playing)

571
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,522
<i>Lover, I don't play to win.</i>

572
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,493
<i>For the thrill until I'm spent.</i>

573
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,997
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

574
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,795
<i>Paint the hole...</i>

575
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,715
(all screaming and sobbing)

576
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,853
I'll fuckin' kill you!
I'll kill all of you!

577
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,455
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell?

578
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,660
Well, I missed the target.

579
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,384
Yeah, but you hit the tree.

580
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,289
Mm-hmm. (Inhales)

581
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:57,898
Ah! Everybody stays!

582
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,466
- Hooray!
- Fuck!

583
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,973
(clears throat)
Well, that happened.

584
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,869
I know it's tough,
but sometimes you gotta

585
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,576
stake the king
to take the castle.

586
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,244
(inhales)
Now, if I had to guess,

587
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:10,878
I would say that you are the chef

588
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,082
and you're not
from around here.

589
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,316
- Oui.
- Well, here's what's gonna happen.

590
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,677
You're gonna follow
me back to the kitchen.

591
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,667
If you try anything weird,
I'll pour hot lard

592
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,483
all over your frog face. Oui, oui?
Now go help your fallen idol, okay?

593
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,853
Lift with the legs. Make it nice.
Show some respect.

594
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,572
(clears throat) Okay, listen up,
Simone de Beauvoir.

595
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,110
- Yannick.
- Yannick? Like Yannick Noah?

596
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,348
<i>Hmm.</i>

597
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,711
The sweetest calves of
all the rackets men. (Sighs)

598
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,716
Well, here's the story.
You do what I ask,

599
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,917
you play ball and you
prepare a feast fit for

600
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,620
the royal family and
I will give some

601
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,401
serious consideration
into letting you live.

602
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,452
If you try to be a hero,

603
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:02,460
pain will very much exist
in this dojo, my friend.

604
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,861
So, we are gonna play
a little parlor game,

605
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,970
one that has only
gotten better with age,

606
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,868
one that I like to call
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

607
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,271
Everybody calls it that,
pinchero.

608
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,912
Well, that's because
it's so good!

609
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,774
Who the fuck is Kevin Bacon?

610
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,951
What? Hello! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

611
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:27,384
I am laughing at you because
that is so dumb. Kevin Bacon?

612
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,990
Uh, Kevin Bacon is the
center of the movie universe,

613
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,092
and I don't want to hear any
of this bullshit about Brian Cox,

614
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,059
because it's Kevin Bacon,
it's always been Kevin Bacon

615
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,925
and it always will be.
And maybe you'd know that

616
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,999
if you had an ounce of culture
or any interest in the arts.

617
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,528
Eat a hot bowl of dicks, Mimi.

618
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,108
All right, now before
we roll up our sleeves,

619
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,004
I'm gonna need some culinary
background on you, buster.

620
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,904
And don't inflate
the skills, all right?

621
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,637
If you're a one-trick pony,
so be it.

622
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,348
Just shoot me straight.

623
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,414
So what's the story, morning glory?
Crepes or no crepes?

624
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,120
What are we talking
about here, buddy?

625
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,488
Use your words. Go ahead.

626
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:09,823
My great-grandfather,
Claude Henri St. Eclair,

627
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,932
studied French and
Moroccan cuisine

628
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,765
with world-renowned
chef Jean-Jaques LePen.

629
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,375
He and my father Bob were
at one time considered

630
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,171
the best sauté and charcuterie
chefs on the planet.

631
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,610
And to make along story short,

632
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,183
my sick-minded
doomsday adversary,

633
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:34,686
I once brought a
57-year-old widow to climax

634
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:39,053
just moments after she
tasted my boeuf bourguignon

635
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:44,699
with country vegetables
and just a touch of white truffle oil.

636
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:51,340
Any more stupid questions,
you minion of Beelzebub?

637
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,845
What reason could you
possibly have for working here?

638
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,380
Who was in blank
with so-and-so?

639
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,648
Who was in blank with so-and-so?
Who was in blank with so-and-so?

640
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,086
Who was in blank with so-and-so?
Who was in blank with so-and-so?

641
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,417
Was in... Argh!

642
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,759
Those are the rules.
So, my tribes members,

643
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,867
winner gets to keep their legs
and stretch them. Finish last...

644
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,570
Just get on with it already!

645
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,204
I am totally freaking out
over here and I can't deal!

646
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,239
I cannot deal. (Sighs)

647
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:30,207
Tuesday Weld. Tick-tack.

648
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,210
(Mimi): This is boring.

649
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,610
Let's kill someone before
I slip into a coma.

650
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,012
Mimi, why don't you
go find some hedges?

651
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,246
Because this is fun and games
time and I have the conch.

652
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,014
Tuesday Weld is a
person or activity?

653
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,887
(Cricket): Wait.
Whoa, I got it. I got it.

654
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,950
- No way.
- Super fun. Go!

655
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,695
Tuesday Weld was in
"Falling Down" with Robert Duvall,

656
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,091
Robert Duvall was
in "Days of Thunder"

657
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,924
with Thomas Cruise Maypother,
and the Cruise missile

658
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,068
was in "A Few Good Men"
with Kevin Bacon.

659
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,896
Michael Rooker wasn't
terrible in "Days of Thunder."

660
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,047
Fine! But the movie as a
whole could clear a room

661
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,699
because it was shit on a
plate with no crackers!

662
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,537
Now tell me what
I won, motherfucker.

663
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:09,043
Round one.
Back me up on this, Roz.

664
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,304
How's that new collar
treating you, my maestro petite?

665
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:33,133
Extremely uncomfortable
and starting to chafe.

666
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,174
You sadistic
three-horn succubus.

667
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,314
Your insults are surprisingly
colorful, Yannick. (Inhales)

668
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,781
Shall we call this
the Manager's Special?

669
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:46,455
It's okay, I know you're
laughing on the inside.

670
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,020
(sighs, sniffs) Oh.

671
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,048
Mmm!

672
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,117
Credit where credit's due.
You're good, Yannick.

673
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,152
- To the horse race!
- Nice!

674
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,694
And Roz is still holding on,
but frickin' barely!

675
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,365
- She's a warrior!
- Okay, I'm coming in!

676
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,528
All right, you stay here,
keep tenderizing,

677
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:39,207
and prepare the salad
if you're thinking salad.

678
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,841
But if I'm being
perfectly honest,

679
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,068
tonight's not really
about roughage.

680
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,251
I'm speechless.

681
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,352
I totally underestimated
both of you, especially you.

682
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,057
Manager's Special. (Inhales)

683
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,816
Dude, we have a couple
of genuine cinephiles here.

684
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,393
They have nailed
some really obscure shit!

685
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,412
- Fantastic. Where are we now?
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.

686
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,767
Lillian Gish for
all the marbles.

687
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:04,766
Gish.

688
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,863
Not really chewy at all.

689
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:10,072
<i>- Mm-mm.
- “Mm.</i>

690
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,172
No. We struck gold with
J.C.V.D. back there.

691
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,843
- You guys ain't seen nothing yet.
- I got it!

692
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,374
- Fuck!
- No way!

693
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,944
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

694
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,443
Okay, okay, okay. Is, uh-uh-uh,

695
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,057
Bacon was in "Diner"
with Daniel Stern.

696
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,047
Stern was in "My Blue Heaven"
with Joan Cusack.

697
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,847
Joan was in "Say Anything"
with her brother John.

698
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,783
John was in "Stand by Me"
with Wil Wheaten.

699
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,389
Wheaten was in "Ham bone and Hillie"
with Lillian Gish!

700
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,288
Wheaten was the...
the grandson?

701
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,622
- Yeah.
- Fuck me with a sand dollar.

702
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,730
By God, tell her what she's won!

703
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,401
All right, now don't get
too cocky, but go ahead.

704
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:44,039
- Get up, stretch it out, do it up.
- I'm so sorry.

705
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,903
Well, Roz was the big loser but
she was at a clear disadvantage

706
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,494
because she was
drifting in and out

707
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,407
- of consciousness the whole time.
- You snooze, you lose.

708
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:52,676
You bit out her voice box.

709
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,578
What did you expect her to do,

710
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,581
pantomime the answers
with the tied-up arms?

711
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,219
You know, not to mention,

712
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:02,050
y'all didn't pick one actor
or actress of color.

713
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,782
She likes urban films.

714
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,892
Sew her up and start over
with Morris Chestnut or Larenz Tate...

715
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,998
- (groaning)
- ...and see what happens, pendeja.

716
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,764
This unmasked
luchador has a point.

717
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:17,167
Hmm. I think he's
a little spic crybaby.

718
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,471
Semantics aside.

719
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,080
I for one am
growing discouraged

720
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,943
by the prospect of fairness,
moving forward.

721
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,811
(groaning)

722
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:36,616
Because while it may seem wry,
given the situation...

723
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,623
I do believe in what's fair.

724
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,470
I've always been a fan
of a well placed disco ball.

725
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,801
Any well-placed ball, really.

726
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,104
I don't believe Roz is gonna
be able to participate

727
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,150
in a lot of the activities
we have planned.

728
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,981
At least not in any kind
of competitive way.

729
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:13,961
So you tell me, Roz.
Does that seem fair?

730
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,357
(gags)

731
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,797
(all screaming)

732
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,898
(gassing)

733
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:28,144
(ﬂying)

734
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,181
(groaning)

735
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,746
(chuckles)

736
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,353
And scene.

737
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,927
<i>(screams)</i>

738
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,828
(music playing)

739
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,834
- <i>I'm so happy that it's you</i>
- <i>(Screaming)</i>

740
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,268
<i>Romeo, a lovesick foo!</i>

741
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,271
<i>I'm so happy that I'm going to
find someone who's realty great.</i>

742
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,775
<i>Uncontrollably uncomplicated,
money and charm are overrated...</i>

743
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:08,574
(screaming)

744
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,289
That's that sap from the john.
I'll be damned.

745
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,718
Well, fuck, bro. Fuck!
He probably called the cops.

746
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,757
No can do. He wasted his
battery on some whore

747
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,088
who does not reciprocate
his love and affections.

748
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,889
Wow.
I completely forgot about him.

749
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:28,127
Yeah, probably the story of his life.
Poor fella.

750
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,805
Aww. I'm sure you can relate.

751
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,599
You heathen bitch!
You know, keep that up.

752
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,310
No, seriously. Keep that up
and see what happens!

753
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,636
Okay, easy, bro. Just...

754
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,906
Oh, ooh. Don't threaten me,
you little faggot.

755
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,311
- Ouch.
- Faggot?

756
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,382
She called me a faggot.
What are we, in high school?

757
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,953
Y-you keep that on reserve in
that sweet little vernacular?

758
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,054
What about honky, huh?
What about mongoloid?

759
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,918
You got... you got
mongoloid on standby?

760
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,095
No, but I like it. (Laughs)

761
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:57,789
I think that might be my
new favorite word. Mongoloid.

762
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,176
- You're ugly on the inside.
- Okay, enough, you guys!

763
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,564
We're wasting silly,
happy, fun times!

764
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,795
Just... just berry pie?

765
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,973
Why don't you go
wrangle the stray for me?

766
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:12,772
This is so fucking lame!
What the f... Argh!

767
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,847
I'm bored as shit.

768
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,950
<i>(screams)</i>

769
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:22,488
<i>Happy that it's you.</i>

770
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,793
I'll make you a deal.

771
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,337
Go grab him,
bring him back alive,

772
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,884
he's your squeaky
toy for the night.

773
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,762
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

774
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:36,367
(sighs) Shit.

775
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,173
(sighs)

776
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,034
I think Mimi may
be a sadist, bro.

777
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,337
- Yep.
- Or an extraterrestrial.

778
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:45,546
Look, I'm sorry.

779
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:46,804
I shouldn't have
threatened her like that.

780
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,239
- That was way out of line.
- No. It's food for thought.

781
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,814
I just fuckin' love
that accent, man.

782
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:51,877
I know you do, bro.

783
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,623
I'd go as far as to say
you're obsessed with it.

784
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,886
- I blame Jenny Agutter.
- I know whose fault it is.

785
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,295
Full frontal in "Equus,"
come on.

786
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,625
- Full frontal in everything.
- (Sighs)

787
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:03,898
- We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

788
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,315
I should go check on Yannick.

789
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,560
Let's get Roz outta here before
she starts to bloat and ooze.

790
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:08,946
What are you thinking? Ribs?

791
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,735
- Rump roast.
- Of course.

792
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,499
(panting)

793
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,876
Hi. Hi.

794
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,819
Listen, I think... you're gonna
think this is hyperbole,

795
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:30,391
but I'm... I'm pretty sure
that my life is literally about to end.

796
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:50,170
(crying) Oh, man.

797
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,075
I was such a shit to Heather.

798
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,180
Say what?

799
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:05,759
My best friend has this huge crush
on this really nice fat guy,

800
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,793
and all I do is make fun of him.

801
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:12,598
It's not like I really mean it,
you know?

802
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,629
- I think I'm just jealous.
- Of what?

803
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:22,109
She has the capacity
to be so humane.

804
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,715
I deserve a better
death than this.

805
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,939
Okay, well, look.

806
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,926
Then you better start
brainstorming and shit

807
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,781
because these are
trying times, guera.

808
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:35,047
If I can get free I'll fuckin'
choke these jotos out.

809
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,259
Well, maybe you should have
choked these jotos out

810
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,484
when they were
holding us all hostage.

811
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,922
What'd you want me to do,
drop those dudes right there and

812
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,395
- have 'em cut her head off?
- Just stand and deliver.

813
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,502
What?
That movie's about calculus.

814
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,005
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

815
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,572
I think there's something
that could help.

816
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:54,776
Spit it out.

817
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,809
Okay, um, sometimes
on rare occasions,

818
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,846
like birthdays, holidays, barbecues,
I'll do a little bit of coke.

819
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,107
But I swear to God,

820
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,411
I feel so goddamn
guilty afterwards it's like,

821
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,916
what's the point of doing
it in the first place?

822
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:10,991
Because it's fun and it
makes me feel good, that's why.

823
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,660
All right, you just say three
Hail Marys and get on with it.

824
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,490
Okay, fine! I hide my stash
in my panties, okay?

825
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,860
So it's in there
with a razor blade.

826
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,102
You have a razor blade
in your drawers?

827
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,135
Yes, Hector. My utter lack
of common sense just became

828
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:28,777
our best chance at not dying.
Now andele arriba. (Sniffles)

829
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,479
Okay, but this could get hairy.

830
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,221
Eww. Try again.
I just got a Brazilian.

831
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,608
It's practically winter.

832
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:34,942
Just hurry, fucker!

833
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,450
You be gay as the day is long.

834
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:43,853
You spread your wings
and you fly, you fly gaily.

835
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,059
But be careful.

836
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,489
Please be careful
out there because it's,

837
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,892
I don't know, but I think
the scene is complicated

838
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,635
and there's always a secret
language and mores

839
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,997
and things that you'll
have to know, you know?

840
00:44:56,227 --> 00:45:01,472
And I just want you to be happy and...
think about me sometimes.

841
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:08,014
Like on Yom Kippur.
Or my birthday.

842
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,550
Hola.

843
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:16,019
- Que tal?
- Como estas?

844
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,727
Fuck! Okay! Stand up.

845
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:19,927
No.

846
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,027
Dude, you make
me go under there

847
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,529
and I am going to
fucking neuter you.

848
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,895
Oh! Whoa.

849
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:33,566
Wha... Oh. Ah. Ah.

850
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,175
Good boy.

851
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,940
Now, split your legs,
arms out to the side.

852
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,775
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

853
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,852
Uh, I am a hemophiliac,
so that... you may...

854
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,080
that may alter your strategies.

855
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,452
Uh, uh. (Laughs)
No fucking way.

856
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,754
You mean a... a bleeder?
Are you serious?

857
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,090
- Do not fuck with me.
- (Whimpers)

858
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,959
Are you a bleeder?

859
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,760
Ah, it's not a hundred percent.

860
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,370
But I am fairly certain that
lam the kind of man

861
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,871
that would clot
properly under duress!

862
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,409
I don't even know what
to do right now. (Laughs)

863
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:14,981
You are like a deer that got hit
by a Suburban and didn't die,

864
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,412
and then some asshole
truckers came by,

865
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,246
ﬂipped a bitch, parked,
got out,

866
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,115
pissed on you swordfight-style

867
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:22,881
while your little deer legs
jerked this way and that,

868
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:27,062
I mean... look at yourself!

869
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,263
(chuckles)

870
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:33,595
I'm sorry,
but you are just too pathetic.

871
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:39,839
I wouldn't go easy on you for
all the tea in China, because...

872
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,768
Fuck China.

873
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:51,512
Ow! (Groans)
You fucking fraggle!

874
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,078
(music playing)

875
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:58,522
- <i>Oh, I just died in your arms tonight</i>
- <i>What?</i>

876
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:02,754
Fuck. Get it out of there,
just get it already! Fuck.

877
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,126
If I get swamp ass from
all this running around,

878
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:08,963
- you're gonna wish you were...
- Oh! Oh, my God! Oh!

879
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:13,141
Oh, my God, right there!

880
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:15,344
Last supper. I can dig it.

881
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,543
(grunts)

882
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,974
What are you do...
What the fuck are you doing?

883
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,877
(muffled protests)

884
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,618
<i>Oh, I was wrong.</i>

885
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:29,291
<i>Oh, I just died
in your arms tonight.</i>

886
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,392
<i>It must've been
something you said.</i>

887
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,621
<i>I just died
in your arms tonight.</i>

888
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,797
<i>Oh, I, I just died...</i>

889
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,370
Ow. Aah!

890
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:50,476
Au revoir, mon ami. (Sniffling)

891
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,640
(Stef): Psst.

892
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:56,744
(sniffling)

893
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,086
I know it's unpleasant,

894
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,687
but do you remember
the deal we talked about?

895
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,858
You mean the one
where I get to live?

896
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:08,359
- Yes, sir.
- I have seen all of your faces.

897
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,365
This is true.

898
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:13,091
We'll have to use
the honor system.

899
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,335
I trust you. Anson?

900
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,798
Oh, yeah.
He makes a mean nacho.

901
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,287
I think I could
learn to trust him.

902
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:20,341
You think I believe
this nonsense?

903
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,703
I do this for my friends!

904
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,504
Because at least this way
I can make them into

905
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,616
something glorious
and delectable.

906
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:32,616
That is the gift
I have been given.

907
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:36,256
And that is the least
I can do for them!

908
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,357
For you, I spit!

909
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:44,123
I spit on the ground
where you stand! (Spits)

910
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:56,606
- Awesome.
- That was really awesome.

911
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,228
He was real,
the spitting was real.

912
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,349
- That was really well played.
- That's more like it.

913
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,743
Now we're gonna switch gears

914
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,645
from the raw to
the perfectly broiled.

915
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:05,581
And I was thinking roast,
but we don't have all night.

916
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,010
So why don't you grab the meat

917
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,365
you think would
be the most tender

918
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,388
and then do something
with a mole sauce?

919
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,814
- It's only right.
- It's just.

920
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,395
And don't be shy about
experimenting a little, okay?

921
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,393
We're game for it,
believe you me.

922
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,156
However, under no circumstances

923
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,629
are you to put
basil in anything.

924
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:25,169
If you use basil, I will turn
you inside out, literally.

925
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,272
Am I clear?

926
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,409
- Oui.
- Great.

927
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:35,015
I need ingredients, you corporal
of the devil's royal army.

928
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,516
Well, then you make your
list and then check it twice.

929
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:44,192
(Bert): Aah! Ahh!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

930
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,292
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Wait! I have a Moped.

931
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:50,294
I have a Moped!
I'll do anything!

932
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,968
You made me bleed.

933
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,034
No, no you give me
too much credit, l-l-l...

934
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,796
- Dirty Birdie, time to fly.
- (Music playing)

935
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,509
(Swans) Ow!

936
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,477
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

937
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,142
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

938
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,383
That pinche guera.

939
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,322
(groaning) Oh!

940
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,186
(grunts)

941
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,394
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

942
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,358
Yeah, hit a man while he's down.

943
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,464
Speaks volumes to your character,
pinche puta gringa.

944
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,330
I'm sorry.
I don't speak poverty.

945
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:34,373
Now, keep an eye on this wanker.

946
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,806
If he wakes up and
starts whining again,

947
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,016
I'm gonna cut one
of his ears off...

948
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:46,244
and hold you two horny
little loads responsible.

949
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,684
(kissing sounds)
She tastes nice.

950
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,523
Do you think that Ben's
constant misfortunes

951
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,896
are a self-fulfilling prophecy?

952
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,370
Or do you believe that a person
could just be cursed or damned?

953
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:10,545
Hector. Focus!

954
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,748
<i>Jump in the air.</i>

955
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,206
<i>Jump in the air.</i>

956
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:22,117
Ah, ah, this... this is horrid.

957
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,052
It was next on Chuy's list.

958
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,194
He just redid the upstairs and
the unisex bathroom, so...

959
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,399
Nice! Yeah, he seemed
like a good dude.

960
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:32,123
Probably still be kicking it if

961
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,700
he hadn't stepped up
all man-styles like that.

962
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,702
But that probably doesn't bring
you much comfort, now does it?

963
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,701
Okay, anyhoo, uh,
we need some... (giggles)

964
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,437
"sea salb." (giggles)

965
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,150
What the fuck is "sea salb"?
(chuckles)

966
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,215
Salt, maybe?

967
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,286
Oh. Oh, that's good.
"White panto beans"?

968
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,286
Look at this nonsense.

969
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,151
(chuckles)
This guy can't spell for shit.

970
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,919
"Post-granates"? (Chuckles)
I mean, come on, bro.

971
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,756
Uh, uh, like, if you're gonna
live off the old American dollar

972
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:06,868
- at least learn how to spell "salt."
- Well, there is the stress factor,

973
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,470
what with the medieval
collar and chain and all,

974
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,933
plus he has to cook his friends.

975
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,937
Okay, shit, man. That's fair.

976
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,268
I don't know.

977
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,103
I think we have all this stuff,
except for the pomegranates.

978
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,678
The oregano and the
paprika are over there.

979
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:24,018
Whoa. Little baskets.
(singing nonsensically)

980
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,084
(thinking) Wait, what the...
The Army of Portugal cipher,

981
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,621
the simplest code ever
used during wartime.

982
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,520
Everybody knows that.

983
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,285
Who the fuck is
allergic to basil?

984
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,923
Flan is really weird.

985
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,966
I don't know whether
I like it or dislike it.

986
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,966
Something smells good
over there though.

987
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:47,664
I'm so glad you approve,
you witch bride of Hecate.

988
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,002
What did you just call me?

989
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,945
Five minutes, you guys.

990
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,015
Five minutes to get Roz's
quasi-orthopedic fucking shoe

991
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,947
off of her bloated-ass foot.

992
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,157
(sighs) Goddamn triple knot.

993
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,449
I caught the mouse.

994
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,121
Yeah, you did, baby.
Where is he now?

995
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:06,149
Soaking in his own sauce.

996
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,159
Mm-hmm-hmm.

997
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,363
Now, are you gonna
pull your own weight,

998
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,122
or do I have to do all
your shit for you too?

999
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,595
No, I already did.
I halved her.

1000
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,236
Yannick can take her
ass from here, literally.

1001
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,132
There are no lentils
anywhere, okay?

1002
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,898
This is... This is pure chaos.

1003
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:25,170
There's like spices with herbs,
and just like boxes full of just shit.

1004
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,575
(sighs) Ha.

1005
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,246
Uh, hello. You got some, like,

1006
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:37,720
"Manchurian Candidate"
shit going on in there?

1007
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:41,929
- No, I'm good.
- All right, look. I know that it...

1008
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,665
it doesn't seem ideal but,

1009
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,265
uh, I'm actually a
pretty good listener.

1010
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,696
So, if, you know,

1011
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:52,066
if you have some stuff that's
bothering you that's, you know,

1012
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,538
like not directly related to
the bind that you're in here...

1013
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:59,578
I mean, you know, baby ears.

1014
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:04,047
Well, I guess... I guess deep
down I was kind of hoping

1015
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,550
you would figure it out on
your own, that you would...

1016
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:09,917
I don't know,
that you would just kind of feel it.

1017
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:13,891
Feel what?

1018
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,060
I think I might be
crushing on you a little bit.

1019
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,362
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1020
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,868
Well, you know, (clears throat),
that's kind of normal.

1021
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,903
You've heard of
Patty Hearst, right?

1022
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,302
No. Um, yeah, yes.

1023
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,942
But no, not like that.

1024
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,043
Like this.

1025
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,955
Okay. Okay, uh,
complete transparency.

1026
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,159
I met a girl today and I haven't
been able to stop thinking

1027
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,895
about her since
I got here and...

1028
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,893
Uh, okay, don't get me wrong.

1029
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,964
I don't have like herds
of women, you know,

1030
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,829
that I'm fending off every...
You know.

1031
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,079
So, like, you don't...

1032
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,943
you don't think I'm like
a complete psychopath?

1033
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,534
Can I be completely
frank with you?

1034
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,349
Yes, be frank,
be completely frank.

1035
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,089
I mean, sure,
it's completely depraved

1036
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,680
and demented what
you're doing here,

1037
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,067
and while bearing witness to

1038
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,319
my very good friends'
grisly executions

1039
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:21,620
have scarred me for eternity,
I do have a confession to make.

1040
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:22,830
You have a confession?

1041
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:27,501
Oh, bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

1042
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,101
Oh, yes, you're blessed.

1043
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,274
See... the naked truth
is that I also find your

1044
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,138
complete lack of inhibition and
unbridled, primal conditioning

1045
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,940
exhilarating and fiercely erotic.
You must be German.

1046
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,617
I-I-I am German.
I'm a German-American.

1047
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:44,842
How'd you know that?

1048
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,282
I felt it. Oh, my God.

1049
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,890
My heart is beating so fast
right now I think I might swoon.

1050
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:53,389
Oh, my God.
My heart is so jacked up too.

1051
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:58,497
Mm-hmm.
And right now I just know.

1052
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,861
You just know?

1053
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,626
Yeah, beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

1054
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,999
- Oh, that's so airtight.
- Yeah, it's really intense.

1055
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,970
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course, God.

1056
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,199
What exactly are
you talking about?

1057
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,468
- Fate.
- Oh, fate.

1058
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,080
- Brought us together.
- So mysterious.

1059
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:17,376
Because I guess
I could put the thing

1060
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,315
with Bethany on hold... Mm-hmm.

1061
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,020
Oh, fuck.

1062
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,562
I hate that bitch Mimi and
the way she talks down to you.

1063
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,566
I hate that bitch.

1064
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:40,331
(sighs) Yeah.
She is a bad person, right?

1065
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:44,171
Yeah, but not you.
You're a romantic.

1066
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,939
I am. I'm totally a romantic.

1067
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,911
Oh, it's been such a hard year.

1068
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,118
It really has.

1069
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:55,448
I mean Mimi's totally
thrown off the mix.

1070
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,885
(sighs) And I'm just not
sure how much longer

1071
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,856
I'm cut out for this
game, you know?

1072
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,563
It's getting way harder
to find places without

1073
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:07,929
security systems or windows.
I don't know. (Sighs)

1074
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,864
Oh, no. I've said too much.

1075
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,597
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You haven't said enough.

1076
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:17,311
Yeah. Yeah, pinch it really hard,
right on the bottom.

1077
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,205
Like Lou Ferrigno.

1078
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,116
Goddamn it, Hector,
what is taking so long?

1079
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,732
This razor blade's
all dulled down.

1080
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,007
How much blow were you chopping
with this thing, gringa?

1081
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:25,986
It's been a long
semester, Hector.

1082
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,052
Like you're a bastion
for lawful behavior.

1083
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,416
At least I don't have
a permanent record.

1084
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,149
Hey. That stings, all right?
I've turned a corner.

1085
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,418
I take all my hostilities
in the ring now.

1086
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,629
It's called an outlet.

1087
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,560
Okay, well, congratulations.
You're all growns-up.

1088
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,763
Come watch me
fight if you want.

1089
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,940
Lots of times they
serve snow cones.

1090
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:47,642
Plus I'm undefeated.

1091
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,909
- Really? (Sniffs)
- Yeah.

1092
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,347
You fight any black dudes?

1093
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:58,814
Yeah. Like, three.

1094
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,327
So you, uh...

1095
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:12,033
You want to maybe, um,
go on a date with me?

1096
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:18,640
Like a proper date if we...
if we don't croak tonight?

1097
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,706
(chuckles) You're, like,
old enough to have

1098
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,876
been kicked out of Menudo.

1099
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,615
So are you saying
there's a chance or...

1100
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:32,946
Yes. I mean, yeah.
What the fuck. (Chuckles)

1101
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,383
You've already
been to third base.

1102
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,522
(chuckles)

1103
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:39,624
- (laughs)
- Yeah.

1104
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,610
As long as we don't have
to eat Mexican food.

1105
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:44,322
No, no. We can, uh,
do Korean barbecue?

1106
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:48,525
Yeah. Cool.
That sounds really nice.

1107
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,975
(music playing)

1108
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,804
<i>If you close your eyes
and you still feel the demons.</i>

1109
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,539
<i>Chewing at your brain
and gnawing your shoe.</i>

1110
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:04,581
<i>Just tel! Them to go
and find someone...</i>

1111
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,879
Where do you stand on purees.
Purees are general.

1112
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,249
Oui, oui.

1113
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:15,493
Your puree is out of luck.
More of a standard mash...

1114
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,164
What's happening to me?

1115
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,395
- Am I dead?
- Pipe down, gay Sammy.

1116
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:22,659
We're in the middle
of a powwow here.

1117
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,395
Okay, okay, sorry.

1118
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,600
Wait. Si r?

1119
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,344
I'm gonna bleed to death maybe.

1120
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,047
Just shut your ass and
think of something plush.

1121
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:39,915
Chewbacca. Chewbacca.

1122
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:43,287
(music playing)

1123
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:44,855
(chuckles)

1124
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:57,971
<i>Mm, yeah.</i>

1125
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:01,266
<i>I used to think
maybe you loved me.</i>

1126
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,569
<i>Now, baby, I'm sure.</i>

1127
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:10,583
Holy crusty moly.
That is a rump roast, Yannick.

1128
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,480
Baby got back!

1129
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,085
That is tender as fuck!

1130
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:17,815
What the fuck.
What the fuck, baby.

1131
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,924
Mm-mm-mm. My butt's in the air.

1132
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,562
My butt's in the air
for this one, baby. Mmm!

1133
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,129
Tender as the night.

1134
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,559
Mmm!

1135
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,496
- Bam, motherfucker!
- Bam, motherfucker!

1136
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:28,997
Yannick, seriously, dude.
Spill the beans.

1137
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,569
Why are you working here,
man, why?

1138
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,469
Hey! Oh, you guys
started eating without me?

1139
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:35,732
Hop in here, brother.

1140
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:39,470
All right, well,
I've got some white panto beans.

1141
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,841
No dearth of those around.
Whoa, hey!

1142
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,676
You hung the stray upside down.
That's kind of neat.

1143
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:48,150
Kind of an homage to the
traditional Mexican pinata.

1144
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,918
Mmm! Mmm!

1145
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,669
- Is it not on point, man?
- Holy shit!

1146
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,820
And you know,
we'd be halfway through

1147
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,605
prepping the next entree
if you weren't

1148
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:57,664
in the pantry
for a fucking hour.

1149
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:58,865
Why were you in there
for so long, man?

1150
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,829
Well, I need to cool
it down with you

1151
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:04,163
and have a little sidebar asap,
ASAP, as soon as possible.

1152
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,498
Well, pumpkin, uh,
I will be back in a flash.

1153
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,175
Keep an eye on quarterback
princess, will you?

1154
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,337
I got this.

1155
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,773
The bartender pulled out
her sweater pups and

1156
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,521
- you split the diff, didn't you?
- I didn't split the difference...

1157
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:27,727
- Come on.
- ...but check this out.

1158
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,691
- She put her finger in my mouth space.
- And you bit it off.

1159
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:31,455
She put her finger
in my mouth space.

1160
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,168
- And you bit her finger off.
- No, brother. That's the kicker.

1161
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,330
- Proceed.
- Our sociopathic behavior and

1162
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,972
our fetish for human
ﬂesh makes her all horny.

1163
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,676
She used the word
horny from the '70s?

1164
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,931
Talk about looking for the
fastball and getting hosed...

1165
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,134
- Ooh.
- ...with the knuckle curve.

1166
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,472
- Sports.
- She gave me the kissy face.

1167
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,307
She gave you the kissy face?

1168
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,619
She gave me the kissy face.

1169
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,375
She gave you the kissy face!

1170
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,681
(singing) She gave me the
kissy face, she gave me...

1171
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,864
She gave you the kissy face!

1172
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,582
Wait a minute, what about Brittney
from the convenience store?

1173
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,006
- Come on.
- Bethany, Bethany.

1174
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,855
- Bethany. Bethany Lynne Goolsby.
- Sweet.

1175
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:01,690
You see, brother?
This is what I'm saying.

1176
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,118
It's too much. Two in one day?

1177
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,733
Yeah, well,
it's too much for any man.

1178
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,861
No, no, I-I was shvitzing.

1179
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,057
- Is my face hot?
- It looks flush.

1180
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:08,964
You should hydrate
with some electrolytes.

1181
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,264
(sighs)

1182
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:17,404
Well, buddy.
I'm not blind, you know.

1183
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,546
It's been tough on you since
I brought Mimi into the mix.

1184
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,775
I love you, and I'm grateful to
you for making this transition.

1185
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,750
- (sighs)
- Hey. It makes me proud.

1186
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:30,957
- Really?
- Yeah.

1187
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,494
Well, here I am,
the big brother,

1188
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,550
and you know I'm always
coming to you for stuff.

1189
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:34,761
- No.
- No, it should be

1190
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,861
- the other way around, you know?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1191
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,607
Who taught me how
to play the mandolin?

1192
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:39,766
I did.

1193
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:40,967
Who taught me how to
play the mouth harp?

1194
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:42,504
- Me.
- Who taught me how to play

1195
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,537
the theremin?

1196
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,535
- That was Dad.
- Shit. That was Dad.

1197
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:50,443
Shit.

1198
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,581
But the mandolin.

1199
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:55,782
- Yeah, that was all you.
- Well, you've got the gift.

1200
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,143
Thank you very much,

1201
01:02:57,407 --> 01:03:00,081
but pretty soon we're both
gonna have nice girls, okay?

1202
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,830
And we're gonna be
playing folksy tunes

1203
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,111
for them at our anniversaries.

1204
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:07,584
But in the meantime I just
want you to be cautious, okay?

1205
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,888
This Bethany girl seems
like a real sweetheart,

1206
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,241
but the powder puff chick...

1207
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:12,481
- Oh, come on.
- I don't know.

1208
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,228
It's just like you
and Mimi last year.

1209
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,266
Well, we met under
similar circumstances,

1210
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:19,736
but it was clear from the get-go
that the Mimes was on the level.

1211
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,738
(inhales)

1212
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,489
Yeah, that's the understatement
of the young millennium.

1213
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,501
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, bro, put her on a leash!

1214
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,761
- Aww.
- No.

1215
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,941
She's like the Marquis
de Sade with Asperger's.

1216
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,507
Part woman, part razorback.

1217
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,608
Just a little bit, but-but-but
just try walking in her shoes

1218
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,812
for a second, would you?

1219
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,013
- I won't.
- Just try it.

1220
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,214
- I won't!
- Try it for me right now.

1221
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:02,631
- This moment.
- Fine, I will.

1222
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,650
Thank you.
She's a bit taller. Can you...

1223
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:04,873
All right, I can do that.

1224
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,949
Straighten your back.
Yeah. The swan-like neck.

1225
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,178
- Oh, yeah. Aah! Aah!
- Now what is that?

1226
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:09,890
Why are you doing that?

1227
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,124
Well, you gotta imagine
fire coming out of my mouth.

1228
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,793
No, no, no.
This is an exercise in empathy.

1229
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,622
Now you're mocking my girlfriend.
Come back to me.

1230
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,132
This is her maiden voyage, okay?

1231
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,921
She's trying to find
a place on the team.

1232
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,398
She's nervous, she's defensive.

1233
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:22,500
She's overcompensating
just a little bit.

1234
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,006
You've heard me say this before.

1235
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:28,004
There are no substitutes
for brown sugar or...?

1236
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,374
- Enthusiasm.
- You got it.

1237
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,046
I got it.
Okay, but you know what?

1238
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:36,505
I am just a little scared
she might kill me in my sleep.

1239
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,583
There is no way
that would happen.

1240
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:40,321
Because if it did,
I would kill her right back.

1241
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,943
And then I would
gouge her eyes out,

1242
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:43,649
and then I would pickle your
head and put it on a stick

1243
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,223
- so you would always be with me.
- (Giggles)

1244
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,655
I'm getting to Greek tragedy now.
It's a bit trite. I'm sorry.

1245
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,522
(sighs) All right, so what's
my play with Kerry?

1246
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,494
Should I put gum in her hair?

1247
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,696
- No, don't do that.
- All right.

1248
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,063
What you want to do is
you want to spend some time with her,

1249
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:58,829
you want to find
out if she's legit.

1250
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,872
But remember she's your
responsibility, brother, okay?

1251
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,771
You got the ball, so...

1252
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,775
- See if she's the belle.
- Thank you.

1253
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:11,045
(chuckles) You had some
fun with Roz here, huh?

1254
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,554
I did that for you, big brother.

1255
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,514
Hey, Roz, we're gonna
go in the other room.

1256
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,348
You gonna hang here?

1257
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,918
- (Mimi): Hi-yah!
- (Groaning)

1258
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,895
See?
That's what I'm talking about.

1259
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,793
(groaning)

1260
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,210
Yannick? I know you and
Roz were bosom buddies.

1261
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,880
- She was one of a kind.
- My sentiments exactly.

1262
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,310
Be a shame to waste
these getaway sticks.

1263
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:43,550
They're like freaking redwoods.

1264
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,754
- (Bert groans)
- You like, uh, chili?

1265
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:48,546
Does the pope shit
in the woods?

1266
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,758
Ooh!
We got plans for those dogs?

1267
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,756
Look, this piggy went to the market,
stayed for lunch.

1268
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,903
I could use these in the
next immunity challenge.

1269
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,792
Trick or treat,
smell these feet.

1270
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,055
Oh, my goodness.
I love that idea.

1271
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,826
Take your girl, get it started.

1272
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,593
All right, campers.

1273
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:06,671
Before each of you is one
of Roz's thick-ass tootsies

1274
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:09,240
that I hacked off like a champ.

1275
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,447
And the game is, lean in nice

1276
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:14,580
and gnaw through
your designated foot.

1277
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,080
The first one to hit bone wins

1278
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,753
a bathroom break
and a shot of Baileys!

1279
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:20,954
We don't have Baileys.

1280
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,919
- Shit! Do we have Frangelico?
- Yes.

1281
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,286
And a shot of Frangelico!

1282
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:35,203
That is unlike anything
I have ever tasted,

1283
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,636
yet still undeniably
chili-esque.

1284
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:40,696
Babe, you gotta try this.

1285
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,673
My squeaky toy passed out.
Can we set him on fire?

1286
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,881
- No.
- Like... friendly fire.

1287
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,707
Please.

1288
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:51,774
Come on, take a little nibble.
Touch that toe.

1289
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:53,852
Eat that toe.
Look at that big toe.

1290
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,390
You haven't ever
tried it before.

1291
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,647
How do you know
you don't like it?

1292
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,191
Well, how about you, Hector?
Get in there! You're the man!

1293
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,361
If anyone can do this,
Hector can!

1294
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:03,563
(groans)

1295
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,300
(laughs) Come on, babe!
I feel like all alone out here.

1296
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,523
You wanna get in on this?

1297
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:08,862
I feel like you're really
holding back on me.

1298
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,628
Oh, yeah. Come on, slut!
Eat it! Do it!

1299
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,204
What the fuck,
you sellout bitch?

1300
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:16,637
- I hate you!
- Oh, this is so fucking awesome!

1301
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,844
See? That's nice.
We make out like that.

1302
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,137
Oh, yeah! Yeah! All right.

1303
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,973
Come on, Hector! Don't hold back!
Don't be a little bitch!

1304
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,649
Like you didn't chow
on worse shit in prison.

1305
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,818
Oh, shit! Oh, snap! (Laughing)

1306
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,681
(distorted laughter)

1307
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,092
(Anson grunts)

1308
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,331
This is how they do it in
Matamoros. Pinche! Oh!

1309
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,869
Hector! No, no, Hector! No more.
He's unconscious.

1310
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:48,166
- We've gotta get out of here!
- Fucking untie me now, please!

1311
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,844
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay. Oh. Here's my pitch. Okay.

1312
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,570
Chuy just installed that little
A.C. unit in the wall upstairs.

1313
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,282
We push it out and maybe
we can get out through the hole.

1314
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,779
Holy shit! That's amazing. Yes.

1315
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,076
Wait, wait, wait.
What about Yannick?

1316
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,788
- He's alive. So is Bert.
- Bart's on his own. No.

1317
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:03,683
Look. Okay, look.

1318
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,891
You two get out of here,
all right?

1319
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,287
Call the cops, don't look back.
I got this.

1320
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,111
Hector, wait!
Please, please be careful!

1321
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,765
I will not go out with you
if you're dead or all fucked-up looking!

1322
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,733
(music playing)

1323
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:23,870
(shrieks)

1324
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,081
Oh. Whoa!
Did he just beat me with a foot?

1325
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,112
Yeah, but you're okay,
thank God.

1326
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,113
(Hector): Cricket!
Cricket, you all right?

1327
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,478
Come on!

1328
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,949
You ready to squabble,
Mexicali?

1329
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,656
Not in front of the ladies.

1330
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,587
Oh, well, fine then.
Let's take it upstairs.

1331
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,456
There's more real
estate down here, bitch.

1332
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,730
Well, but I really need to tinkle
before I beat you to death.

1333
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,335
- Wish me luck, babe.
- Luck.

1334
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,666
After you, Tito Santana.

1335
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:57,074
This is turning
into a snooze fest.

1336
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,645
We have killed, like,
like, two people.

1337
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:04,851
Why don't you just...
just try the fuckin' chili?

1338
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,992
Whoo! That's more like it.

1339
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:27,829
Oh, man,
look at this big long table

1340
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,841
right in the middle
of our thunder dome.

1341
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,136
Yeah, it's for
quinceaneras and shit.

1342
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,284
(breathing heavily)

1343
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,954
You don't look so hot,
Lord of the Flies.

1344
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:43,823
Yeah, it's bizarre.

1345
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,459
I get this pressure
behind my ears, Yannick.

1346
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,685
Followed by a swelling
of the lymph nodes

1347
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,160
and a gradual closing
of the windpipe.

1348
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,692
I do not follow you,
Old Scratch.

1349
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:59,565
(breathing heavily)
Give me that list, man.

1350
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,901
Give me the list!

1351
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,008
- (Mimi): Hal.
- (Kerry): Got it, got it, got it.

1352
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,516
Ha! Oh. My God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1353
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:16,087
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I knew you were full of shit!

1354
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:20,487
Hal I pulled exactly the
same move last year!

1355
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:24,028
The difference is I walked
the fucking walk! (Laughs)

1356
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,859
- What the fuck happened to your accent?
- I know. It's good, huh?

1357
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,730
Stefan is a total fucking
sucker for a British chick.

1358
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,529
So you're actually two
psychos for the price of one.

1359
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,105
What a fucking bargain!
(cuckoo clock sounds)

1360
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:35,501
I guess.

1361
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:39,938
Oh, that's nice.

1362
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,183
We doing this like men or like
pussies with axes and shit?

1363
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:46,886
Yah! (Chuckles)

1364
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,870
No. No. I'm sorry.
That was... that was mean.

1365
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:50,718
Here,
I'll leave this right there.

1366
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,294
(Stef thinking)
"Sea salb" and "post-granates."

1367
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,464
It's the Army
of Portugal cipher.

1368
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,065
So simple.

1369
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,438
Oh, fuck.

1370
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,072
You snuck a dash of basil
in there, didn't you, Yannick?

1371
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:11,904
I myself have dabbled in
the business of diabolique.

1372
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:15,378
- Surely you jest.
- A culinary prodigy like myself.

1373
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:19,747
How else do you explain me
working in this casket of shat?

1374
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:22,616
I have been asking you
that shit all night, Yannick!

1375
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,222
You withholding asshole!

1376
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,528
What the fuck is she doing?

1377
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,558
I don't know, but you being
in front of me feels right.

1378
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,924
Ooh! Ah.

1379
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,998
Okay! I float like a butterfly,
sting like a...

1380
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,767
I used to have my own
bistro in Laguna Beach.

1381
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:44,741
Only one house rule.
Absolutely no substitutions.

1382
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,345
Aah! Oh, yeah.

1383
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,844
Nice on, cabron. Landed flush.

1384
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:51,141
Yeah, it did.

1385
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,318
It was a Thursday.

1386
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,180
I was of course in the kitchen

1387
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,856
preparing a
six-course fugu feast

1388
01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:01,425
featuring the
exotic puffer fish.

1389
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,597
- That's the poisonous one.
- Oui.

1390
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,427
This idiot insists
that the fugu skin

1391
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:11,469
be drizzled with ponzu
sauce for added flavor.

1392
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,654
Yannick, you're gonna
need to cap this story, bro.

1393
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,639
I gotta castrate you
before my face implodes.

1394
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,435
All right.

1395
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,977
Disco.

1396
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:23,676
Bloodbath.

1397
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:26,776
Boogie.

1398
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:31,287
Somehow, poison from
the liver of the puffer fish

1399
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,290
made it into the zosui.

1400
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,157
One bite later the son
of a bitch was dead.

1401
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:40,859
Oops.

1402
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,403
Well, butter my biscuit,
Yannick,

1403
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,233
because you broke
my one and only rule.

1404
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,202
And you know what that means.

1405
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:48,964
Fever!

1406
01:12:56,505 --> 01:13:00,146
- (all screaming)
- (Music playing)

1407
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,219
Come on! Come on!

1408
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,555
(grunting)

1409
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,828
(screaming)

1410
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,902
Fuck you, bitch!

1411
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,105
Sorry, Kerry!

1412
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:23,037
Getting on this bitch
was a bad fucking idea!

1413
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:25,075
(grunting)

1414
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:29,917
All right,
this is lame baggins.

1415
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:33,016
How does that feel, Yannick?
Tell me how that feels.

1416
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,586
- (choking)
- I'm sending you home, man.

1417
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:38,189
You like it? Do you like...

1418
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,419
(shouts) Oh, shit!

1419
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,094
<i>When disc-goes to hell.</i>

1420
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,033
<i>That's where we're at,
where we're at</i>

1421
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,434
(shrieks)

1422
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:56,938
- You're like a cockroach!
- I'm a cricket!

1423
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:04,979
(screaming and crying)

1424
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,744
(shouting)

1425
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:15,089
Ow! Why would you do that, man?

1426
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,895
(laughing) Okay,
okay, okay, okay,

1427
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,002
Way, Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay!

1428
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:31,571
Hey, why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1429
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:32,779
Huh.

1430
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:37,909
(groaning)

1431
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,477
<i>Disco this.</i>

1432
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,347
<i>Disco that.</i>

1433
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,352
<i>Disc-goes to hell.</i>

1434
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:47,093
<i>That's where we're at,
where we're at.</i>

1435
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,854
Shut your eyes,
Liberace! (Grunts)

1436
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,293
(grunting)

1437
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,467
We clearly had a
falling-out, Yannick!

1438
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,274
(screaming)

1439
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,211
(growling)

1440
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:16,388
<i>(screams)</i>

1441
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,488
No, no, no, no!
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1442
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:21,154
Fuck, Kerry, I'm sorry!
You were supposed to fucking hold her!

1443
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:22,787
I'm sorry! Get up! Get up!

1444
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,966
(sighs) Well, you really blew
the shit out of that one.

1445
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,799
Now, how shall we do this?

1446
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,304
Is there a single scenario
where I don't die?

1447
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,806
(laughs)

1448
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,912
(panting) Fine.

1449
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:46,085
But no more blood, seriously.

1450
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,183
I can respect that.

1451
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:51,915
(grunting and groaning)

1452
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:58,190
No holds barred, joto.

1453

(groans)

1454
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,033
Please tell me you've
seen "Road House."

1455
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,504
(giggling)

1456
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,943
You think this is fuckin' funny,
you sick son of a bitch?

1457
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,773
(giggles) I do now.

1458
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:18,780

1459
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:38,938
<i>Oh, Ruck. Whoa'.!</i>

1460
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:44,142
Well, that totally worked.
Yeesh.

1461
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:50,216
(Stef and Yannick laughing)

1462
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,043
Oh, fuck.

1463
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:56,086
It's time for one of us to die.
You know this.

1464
01:16:56,312 --> 01:17:00,158
- Fuck yeah.
- But which one?

1465
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,954
I nominate me...
and vote for me.

1466
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,133
(laughing)

1467
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,096

Oh, God, Cricket.

1478
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,793
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1479
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,189
Hey!

1480
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,055
Oh, God, fuck.

take you seriously

1486
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,393
with that humongous camel toe.

1487
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,754
You're not funny, you asshole!

1488
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,329
I have a long labial
It's genetic!

1489
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,771

(gasps)

1491
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,880
This is what it
feels like to die.

1492
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:04,107
Now go to hell, and take
your giant pussy with you.

1493
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,286

1494
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:20,630
(gassing)

1495
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:36,109
Ah. Ha. This is for Cricket.

1496
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:45,487
Yeah. I'm not sure if Mimi
recovers from that one. (Laughs)

1497
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:49,262
Yeah, she'd really
worn out her welcome.

1498
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:53,160
Yeah. Well, trust me.

1499
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:59,065
You just saved Stef a fuck-load
in couples therapy. (Laughs)

1500
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,572
(sighs) Aw.

1501
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,904
I'm sorry about Cricket.
You okay?

1502
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,479
Yeah. Never better.

1503
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,774
I'm assuming you
took care of Hector?

1504
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:14,180
Uh, yeah.
Kid had chutzpah though.

1505
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:20,257
And a hell of a ground attack.
Yep, that's my bone.

1506
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:22,817
The kid got cocky though.

1507
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,760
He tried to bust out
some old-school Swayze.

1508
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,789
The kind of mistake he
could have learned from

1509
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:31,199
if I hadn't turned his skull
into a kayak. (Chuckles)

1510
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,371
Come hold hands with me.

1511
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:37,202
Uh, y-yeah. (Sighs)

1512
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,503
(groans)

1513
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,145
Whoa!

1514
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:55,626
Kriss Kross will make you...
jump.. jump. Jump-

1515
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,660
Oh, bro!

1516
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:01,163
It looks like you... you took
some lumps there too, huh?

1517
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,370
You got a big ol' pumpkin head.

1518
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,701
Oh, all right. Brace yourself.

1519
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:16,339
I got some tough news.
Mimi's dead.

1520
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:20,852
I know, I know.

1521
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,886
- "Babil."
- I know... Babil.

1522
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:25,090
"Babil."

1523
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,554
I know... she's a sweet,
sweet Babil, but listen.

1524
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:28,760
We're gonna miss her.

1525
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:32,157
But I gotta tell you she didn't
deserve you, okay, man?

1526
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,388
I'm not afraid to say it.

1527
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:36,934
No, you... you have so much
more to offer than that.

1528
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:40,264
"Babil"! "Babil"!

1529
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:42,031
Sea salb. Panto beans?

1530
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:43,607
I mean, we brought up
everything they had.

1531
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:47,712
Hmm! The Army of
Porthugal cipher.

1532
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:52,078
The Army of Porthugal cipher!

1533
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:55,288
She did this!

1534
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:57,114
I can't understand
what he's saying.

1535
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:59,017
Can you? Can you understand?

1536
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,524
I think what he's trying to
say is that I'm the only one

1537
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,855
who could have
delivered the basil.

1538
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,858
(grunting)

1539
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:15,302
No, Stef! Stef, no! Breathe!
Breathe! Breathe, Stef!

1540
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:17,305
Aah!

1541
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:18,772
You fuckin' bitch!

1542
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,275
You lied to me!
I trusted you and you lied to me!

1543
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:22,709
Yeah, guilty as charged.

1544
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,779
I'm not really attracted
to dickless cannibals.

1545
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,113
That's not true! I have a dick!

1546
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:30,749
I'm gonna fuckin'
kill you, I swear!

1547
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,459
Wagging)
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

1548
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,558
Oh, Stef! Stef, breathe!

1549
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,491
Breathe!
I'm here, little brother!

1550
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:41,428
You're okay! It's okay!
Just breathe!

1551
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:44,831
Hey! Please! Please!
Please! Please!

1552
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,733
I don't know what to do.
I'll do anything.

1553
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:48,670
He needs an airway.
Tracheotomy time.

1554
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,574
Well, you're... you know!
You're a paramedic!

1555
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,681
You, it's your responsibility!
You have to help!

1556
01:22:54,837 --> 01:22:57,010
Yeah, I don't start 'til Monday.

1557
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:03,620
It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay, Stef. No, no.

1558
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:05,985
I'll be here with you,
little brother.

1559
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,491
It's okay. I'll...

1560
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:11,321
(gassing)

1561
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,264
It's okay. I'm with you, bro.

1562
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,869
I'm right here.
Don't be scared, okay?

1563
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:20,936
I'll stay right here with you.

1564
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,301
(coughing)

1565
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:24,636
Okay. Come on, come on.
You've gotta help me, Bert.

1566
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:26,347
- You're an oak, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

1567
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:29,038
- I cannot carry you up the stairs.
- Well, I'm sorry!

1568
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,942
I don't know why
I'm still alive either!

1569
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,777
It doesn't add up!

1570
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,012
(mouthing words)

1571
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:47,391
( screams ) Fuck!

1572
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,391
Well, that's not
gonna do anything.

1573
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:58,808
Are you out of your fucking mind?
He's got an axe!

1574
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,413
- Fuck! Just...
- Hurry! Hurry!

1575
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,914
I got it. I got it.
Okay, okay, okay.

1576
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,881
What is it? Did you get a gun?

1577
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:10,521
- Shut up.
- What is that?

1578
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:11,884
Well, have you ever
used one of those before?

1579
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,149
- Bert, seriously, shut up!
- Did you see a manual in there?

1580
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:15,361
Oh, my God.

1581
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,086
Listen, if that backfires,
it could be very dangerous!

1582
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:19,389
Hurry up with that!

1583
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:24,667
(music playing)

1584
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,265
(screaming)

1585
01:24:41,043 --> 01:24:42,886
<i>(screams)</i>

1586
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,144
(breathing heavily)

1587
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,451
You killed my brother.

1588
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:17,282
Yeah, she killed both brothers,
you dickweed. Ha-ha!

1589
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:21,392
I'm gonna have to soak my
finger in vinegar for a week.

1590
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,722
Now burn in hell
and shame the devil,

1591
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,161
you kraut-berry-gib-lookin'
motherfucker.

1592
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:30,902
(clown nose honks)

1593
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,773
That was awesome.

1594
01:25:34,997 --> 01:25:36,067
All right, come on, Bert.
Let's go.

1595
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,279
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (Grunts)
I mean, he's dead!

1596
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,571
Why are we hurrying now?

1597
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,907
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1598
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,446
Come on. (Grunts)

1599
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:46,553
You're all right.
Come on, buddy. You can do it.

1600
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:48,152
- (grunts)
- Okay. All right.

1601
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:50,651
Oh. Oh, Jesus.

1602
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:54,450
Oh, God.
That's just fuckin' ghastly.

1603
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,622
This is the scene of the crime.

1604
01:25:57,853 --> 01:25:59,161
Oh, fuck.

1605
01:25:59,421 --> 01:26:00,923
This is where
Laundrette said no.

1606
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,357
It's all right, Bert.
There are other fishes in the sea.

1607
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,629
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1608
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:08,034
Well, like,
what are you up to, Kerry?

1609
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,799
- Not me, Bert. Not me.
- Well, you said that really fast!

1610
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:14,845
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Come on! Got it!

1611
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,175
Look at you.
You're so athletic.

1612
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:20,886
Right.
All right, Bert, come on.

1613
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:22,816
It's you and me, pal.
Come on, Bert.

1614
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:24,683
You can do it. Come on.

1615
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:27,290
- Ow! God.
- Come on.

1616
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,995
- Okay.
- It's <i>so</i> small!

1617
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,823
Oh, you're small too.
More like the bonsai than an oak

1618
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:33,965
when you really get
down to it. Okay.

1619
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:38,535
Oh! Oh, it's wonderful!
Oh, I'm flying!

1620
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:41,070
You're not flying, Bert!
Stay focused!

1621
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:45,712
Laundrette!
My beautiful Laundrette, you came!

1622
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,127
Who are you talking to, Bert?

1623
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,682
A woman hung me upside down
and hit me with a frying pan.

1624
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:53,751
Get down here so
I can sit on your head bush!

1625
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:57,183
- Baby?
- Fly to me, Bert!

1626
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,824
(grunts) Here I come, my love!

1627
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,324
Brace yourself for
the landing, Bert!

1628
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:07,026
Bert! Bert, are you okay...

1629
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:12,161
(gasps) Oh, God!

1630
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:16,001
Oh, my God! Oh, fuck!

1631
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:20,611
(sobbing) Oh, my God!
I can't...

1632
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:27,414
Kerry?
These chairs are not cool!

1633
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:30,179
Oh! Jesus Christ.

1634
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,023
Kerry!

1635
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:39,429
Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, fuck!

1636
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:42,692
That's for Stef! Oh, fuck!

1637
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,631
(grunts)

1638
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,878
- (grunts)
- Wait! I'm coming too!

1639
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,810
Bert, I'm gonna take your Vespa.

1640
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,119
Hal I beat you! I won!

1641
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:15,125
Wait! Wait! Come back!

1642
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:19,065
I have something really
cool to tell you! Seriously!

1643
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,973
Ah! Ha-ha-ha!
We reap what we sow!

1644
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:32,747
We got her, bro. We got her.

1645
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:35,922
Oh, dear God!
What have we done?

1646
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:39,819
We're supposed to save lives,
not... not...

1647
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,358
Holy shit.

1648
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,961
Kerry Derzius?

1649
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:47,497
Delroy, bring all the
stuff we need, man!

1650
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:51,863
- I know this chick!
- Jesus! (Sighs)

1651
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,668
What, you... you know my name?

1652
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:59,845
You bet your ass I do. It's me.
It's me, Marty Clement.

1653
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:02,513
Uh, we went through
training together.

1654
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:04,307
Am I gonna die?

1655
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,519
'Cause that would
be really ironic.

1656
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:08,516
(exhales) All right, listen.

1657
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:10,217
I want you to sit
tight for me, okay?

1658
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,621
You sit tight right here.
I'll be right back.

1659
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,987
And then I'm gonna be with
you for the rest of time.

1660
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:16,578
Hey, man!
What are you waitin' for?

1661
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,221
I have a real shot over there!
You're gonna blow it for me!

1662
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,966
Marty! Marty!
It never go down, sir.

1663
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:24,136
You no see me.
I smoke from 1:00 in the mornin'.

1664
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,498
Man, are you... are you
telling me you're still high?

1665
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,730
Look upon my eyes, my brethren.

1666
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:31,477
Sweet Christ.
Put those back on!

1667
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,061
All right, listen.
Here's the deal.

1668
01:29:33,235 --> 01:29:34,509
I'll say I was driving, all right?
That's the plan.

1669
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:37,216
- I was behind the wheel.
- Yo, sir. One.

1670
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:38,815
- Uh, what?
- Me owe you one.

1671
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,320
You're goddamn
right you do, man!

1672
01:29:40,342 --> 01:29:41,862
Just, um, help me
get her on the thing!

1673
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,421
Yeah, man.

1674
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,083
All right, Kerry.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1675
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:50,227
- Wait. No. He's gone.
- Shh. Shh.

1676
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:51,555
- He's... No, he's still in the...
- Kerry. Shh.

1677
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,700
You have to save your breath.
No, no, he's g-

1678
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,224
- No, focus on your breathing.
- He's alive. He's alive.

1679
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:56,851
- You know this drill.
- He's not...

1680
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:58,219
- You pick a focal point.
- Please.

1681
01:29:58,426 --> 01:29:59,586
- Look at my mouth.
- Don't...

1682
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:01,436
At my mouth. Fuckin' mouth!

1683
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:05,166
We're gonna lift on three.
One, two... Oh!

1684
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,674
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

1685
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,176
(Kerry screams)
All right! We're moving!

1686
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:09,848
- Sorry, man!
- We're moving!

1687
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,551
Oh, my God! Oh, God.

1688
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:18,190
<i>Deck the halls
with boughs of holly.</i>

1689
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:23,225
<i>Sowing the seeds oi love...</i>

1690
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:26,091
(Anson): (sighs) I know,
I know, but you're my brother.

1691
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,197
You have to say that.

1692
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,925
(sighs)

1693
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:39,808
Oh, this is absurd.
My palms are sweaty.

1694
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:43,413
What, am I like 13? (sighs)

1695
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,982
Shoot me that
ﬂyboy smile again.

1696
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:55,390
(sighs) Thanks, bro.
I'd be so lost without you.

1697
01:30:56,785 --> 01:31:00,096
Okay, wish me luck.

1698
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:26,251
Indubitably.

1699
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:31,658
In-du-bi-tab... lndu...

1700
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:38,332
Would you like a bag for that?

1701
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:43,141
I think we both know the
answer to that question...

1702
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,369
Bethany Lynne Goolsby.

1703
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:55,143
Anson! You came back!

1704
01:31:55,377 --> 01:31:58,358
But what happened to your
face and arm and things?

1705
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:02,220
I have thought long
and hard about this.

1706
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:08,531
And I feel that it is a story
best suited... for another time.

1707
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,071
I can and will tell you
that I now have to poop

1708
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:18,004
into a colostomy bag...
possibly forever.

1709
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,337
I hope this is
not a deal breaker.

1710
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:24,550
Don't be ridiculous.

1711
01:32:26,975 --> 01:32:28,750
This is for you.

1712
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:35,154
I love it!

1713
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,364
Well, the ball is officially
in your court now,

1714
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:40,725
Bethany Lynne Goolsby.

1715
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:45,067
Is it gonna be one spoon,
or two?

1716
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:48,034

1717
01:32:54,836 --> 01:32:56,747

<i>Try to hold my breath.</i>

1738
01:35:31,426 --> 01:35:36,068
<i>Try to keep everything
to myself.</i>

1739
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,904
<i>Wei}, you shot
a big poison arrow.</i>

1740
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:43,911
<i>And it scares me to death.</i>

1741
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:49,087
<i>But I can't think
of nobody else.</i>

1742
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,718

1743
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,528

Some people say.

1756
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,921
<i>That love's a feast.</i>

1757
01:36:57,145 --> 01:37:02,117
