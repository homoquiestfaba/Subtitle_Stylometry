And the you got stuff like,
like... bears.

683
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:28,158
Bears could go either way, because I totally see
them coming out of the the forest and being like...

684
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:36,099
- Grrrrr. Sorry about all those times we ate
you, we actually want to help you. [LAUGHS]

685
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,638
- And obviously everything serpentine
is on the bad side. -Serpentine!

686
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,544
The snakes and the lizards and
the iguanas.

687
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,281
I've never heard anyone have
disdain for an iguana.

688
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,717
OK, then like, dinosaurs?

689
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,489
- There are no dinosaurs! -Anymore. But
a ghost dinosaur is gonna need...

690
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:01,558
to pick a side, no?

691
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,961
You crazy.

692
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,299
Meow.

693
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,003
Most embarrassing moment.

694
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,474
- Most?
- Yeah, worst. Biggest.

695
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,843
- Most embarrassing.
- OK, got it. 5th grade.

696
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,279
All my stories are from when I was a kid.
I must be a boring adult.

697
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,048
- Yep. You are.
- Anyway, 5th grade...

698
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,818
I'm going out with a girl, Katie Stevens,
she's in 6th grade, she's older.

699
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,819
She's slutty.

700
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:30,920
- Sweet.
- It's great.

701
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:31,955
End of the day...

702
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:36,493
her friends come out of class, my friends come out of class.
I know what's gonna happen...

703
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,461
It's gonna be the traditional,
"going-out" hug.

704
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:41,364
I can see it. She peels out from
her crowd...

705
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,767
Makes a bee-line. Hugs me. Very
unprepared.

706
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,637
Very nervous. So when she hugs
me,

707
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,739
I let out a little
[FART NOISE].

708
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,942
- Yeah. Toot. Toot toot.
- No.

709
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,344
- Yeah.
- Ohmygod.

710
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,579
And so my mind is racing - how
to cover this?

711
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:59,782
And all I can think to do is
break the embrace and go...

712
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:04,053
- [BEAT-BOX SOUNDS]
- [LAUGHS]

713
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,688
You started beat-boxing?

714
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,892
- Yeah.
- Wow. Smooth move.

715
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:11,895
- I guess it wasn't such an embarrassing moment.
- You got away with it.

716
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:16,132
- Just illustrates how cool I am.
- Oh, is that what it is?

717
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,268
- Mine was similar.
- Yeah.

718
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,836
A little older, like 8th grade.

719
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,874
Had a major crush, major crush, on
this guy Drew, who was in 9th grade...

720
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,276
who was also very short.

721
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:28,278
- Gross. Yuck.
- Very short.

722
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,447
- All the other boys were way taller than
him for his age. [ENGINE NOISES]

723

Don't let us down right now.

00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:40,195
- I told you this was a piece of crap.
- It's fine, we just...

727
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,092
Sorry.

728
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,928
We won't make it up this hill.

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,129

- We are going to jail for the rest of our lives.
- Supposed to turn this off, right?

734
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,042
- We are going to jail for the rest of our lives.
- Calm down.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Know why I stopped you?

740
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,858

this sucker was gonna explode?

741
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,761
Alright, I'll be with you in a
few minutes.

742
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,830
He didn't think that was very
funny.

00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,600
- Shit.
- What? No, he doesn't know.

- We're going to prison forever. -No,
we're not going to prison forever.

00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:32,041
There are highly illegal drugs, in
this car, right now, and in my body.

Shhh. He can't. Just be quiet.

748
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:37,981
- Do you know your registration
is expired?

749
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:41,451
Oh, officer, I'm so sorry. I've been
meaning to fix that. I'm so sorry.

00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,187
OK, make sure you take care of
that.

Can I come with you?

00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,995
Um, I kinda need to think some
things over.

771
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,899
Um, so I should probably be
alone for a little bit.

- Jules. I think I made a big
mistake.

773

- I went way too far down the
rabbit hole.

drugs.

your hoo-ha.

Your male hoo-ha. Whatever.

778

You just need to be really
careful with her.

Huh. Can you repeat that last
part? It sounded nice to me.

- I was... totally, totally right.
- You were totally right!

821
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,044

out.

called my mom, and then my mom called me.

01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:10,057
happy for you and, and shocked.
All at the same time.

1366
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:11,091
- Because.
- Why?

1367
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,261
You... Like I walk in there and
you're just...

1368
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:17,264
completely owning the room and,
and, and...

1369
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,601
so confident in what you were
saying. And, um...

1370
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,369
Just not scared...

1371
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:27,074
of your creativity and it had been so
long since I had seen you do that.

1372
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:31,345
And I'm, I'm just happy for you. I
hope this is the beginning of a

1373
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:33,647
new leaf or something.

1374
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,921
This is a weird question...

1375
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:44,558
Is there, um, such a thing as
a...

1376
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,859
break-up kiss?

1377
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,763
Um, hmmmm.

1378
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,432
- You ever heard of that?
- [LAUGHS]

1379
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,002
- It occurs in many a film.
- [LAUGHS]

1380
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:57,237
I guess I could see the benefits
of it.

1381
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,440
Why? Did you have one?

1382
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:00,975
No.

1383
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,077
Did she have one?

1384
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,213
I guess so.

1385
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,349
And I got real jealous.

1386
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,152
And it's good that I left LA.

1387
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,988
I needed to. I needed to do this
thing.

1388
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,724
Even if it was a crazy idea.

1389
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:18,225
Because I had to...

1390
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:19,893
do the opposite of my dad.

1391
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:23,364
I had to do what it took. You
know? Because...

1392
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:24,598
Your dad...

1393
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,102
left his entire existence.

1394
01:23:28,104 --> 01:23:30,504
Including you and your family to
go

1395
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:32,106
pursue his dream.

1396
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,342
But why couldn't he have pursued
his dream

1397
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,910
and held on to who he was?

1398
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:39,146
I don't see why those things
can't go together.

1399
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:43,784
I don't think you have to leave everything you've
ever known and everybody who's ever known you.

1400
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:46,086
To go pursue your dream and be
an artist.

1401
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:49,123
For your dad to run away just
because he wasn't finding instant

1402
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,426
success and instant
gratification from others

1403
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:55,362
to me, feels much more cowardly,
um...

1404
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,664
than anything you were doing.

1405
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,901
So maybe your dad is the example
of what not to do.

1406
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:04,004
Not to run away from all the
things that scare you.

1407
01:24:04,006 --> 01:24:06,974
Just stand up to them and
like...

1408
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:11,011
say, "this is who I am," and
like, and and...

1409
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:13,514
I don't know, do what you did
today.

1410
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,650

Hi.

01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,726
Hi.

1425
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,130
I know I can't really make it up
to you, but

1426
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:05,732
I want to at least return this.

1427
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:07,734
And to tell you that

1428
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,370
I'm incredibly sorry.

1429
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,508
- You taped them all back up.
- Yeah.

said a lot of things I didn't
mean.

didn't want to do.

Oliver, I have a lot of
problems.

pixie" thing.

1446

Yep yep yep yep.

1447
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:24,344
Made me feel kinda stupid but
it's true enough, I guess.

1448
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,184
I like "manic pixie."

1449

1453
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,302
would've left here...

the person that I am now,

That's all you.

1458
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,014

You have no idea how good that
makes me feel.

1462
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,264
It's true.

1463
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:22,869
What about the other part?

1464
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:25,005
What other part?

1465
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,375
The "you and me" part.

I mean...

1467
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,583
I think what happened was
that...

1468
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:40,320
You and I went into our own
little dreamworld.

1469
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:41,488
A fantasy land.

1470
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:43,864
Because...

1471
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,660
We wanted it.

1472
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:48,795
We needed it.

1473
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,866
But... it ended

1474
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:55,202
because it wasn't real.

1475
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:58,605
You know, usually...

1476
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,975
with guys I...

1477
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:05,045
have... in the past

1478
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:07,214
spent a lot of time, um...

1479
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,451

01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,887

1481
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,357
Being someone I'm not.

1482
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:22,062
And I did that with you. I did.
I absolutely did.

1483
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,200
But I would catch myself, you
know...

1484
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:36,843
hanging out, you know, in the
car or on the beach.

1485
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:42,849
I felt safe.

1486
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:48,789
And I haven't...

1487
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:51,992
In a long time.

1488
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:59,466
So to me, um...

1489
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:08,041
I feel that there are enough of those
to make trying something worthwhile.

1490
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,844
But... I...

1491
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:15,649
I can understand if you don't want to do that.
If you don't want, um...

1492
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:22,956
I totally want to do that.

1493
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,561
We don't really know each other
that well.
