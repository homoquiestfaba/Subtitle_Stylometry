00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,319
Are you sure about this, Kiki?

3
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,143
When have I ever been wrong?
Name one time.

4
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:04,658
- I don't lie to you, Nick.
- Yeah, without a doubt.

5
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:07,432
- This is who you saw?
- Yeah, that's him.

6
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:10,488
- He's there a lot.
- Take one more look.

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,507
Definitely him.

8
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:17,187
You know serge, What do they say?
That Diaz works for Wraith.

9
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:20,307
I've heard the rumor.

10
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,569
We've got something.

11
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:47,998
He's Diaz.

12
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:51,149
Remember, We get Diaz and we get out.

13
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:57,456
- What about the girls?
- We'll try to set them free.

14
00:01:57,654 --> 00:02:00,880
- Here, Kiki.
- Thanks, Nick.

15
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:03,258
Watch yourself.

16
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,326
Excuse me, boys.

17
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,763
Go!

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,174
- This man just came in.
- I don't remember.

19
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:53,844
He came in with three
other men and five girls.

20
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,977
I must have missed him.

21
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,332
You saw him. Where did he go?

22
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,212
Four...fourth floor.

23
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,742
It's there.

24
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,326
Go.

25
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,151
Go.

26
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,130
Cesar?

27
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,994
Cesar?

28
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:13,597
Cesar, come in.

29
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:17,811
Cesar.

30
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:22,736
ACU, this is VCU-1.
We have 10-45B.

31
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:24,601
Come in.

32
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:27,331
There's no signal.
Someone's using jammer, sarge.

33
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:32,381
It's a set up.
They knew we were coming.

34
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,260
What's up little bitches?!

35
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,961
You're looking for me?

36
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,204
I'm right here.

37
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:45,155
Flash bang!

38
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,640
Wraith, on the end.

39
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,233
- You're hurt?
- No. you?

40
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,533
No.

41
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,629
I'm out.

42
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,068
Sarge...

43
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,379
Sarge... I'm hit, I'm hit.

44
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:38,554
Sarge, sarge...

45
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,186
- I'm bleeding, I know.
- No.

46
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:42,478
You'll be alright.

47
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:46,820
I'll get Wraith.
Back up is coming.

48
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,488
Come on, you've got this.

49
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,987
Come on.

50
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,465
Move, let's go!

51
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:57,368
Nick.

52
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,359
Nick.

53
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,419
Honey... hey.

54
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,129
Doctor say you were lucky.

55
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,458
Your head, It was just grazed.

56
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,894
The shoulder hits were worse.

57
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:13,894
We need some rehab in that.

58
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:18,039
And it would be fine.
You'll be fine.

59
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,288
- Hi, Sofia.
- Hello.

60
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,888
Hey.

61
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,798
- I shouldn't be alive.
- Don't say that, Nick.

62
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:38,307
She's right. You've got to
focus on the real bad guys.

63
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,977
The ones responsible for all this.

64
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,787
This wasn't you fault.

65
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:49,574
Lieutenant Kalalo.
I need a word.

66
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:55,025
- Captain Minter.
- I just came from the crime scene.

67
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:58,917
Do you realize what kind of PR
nightmare we have on our hands?

68
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:02,104
What the hell happened?
It's a bloodbath out there.

69
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,184
Almost an entire strike team was wiped out.

70
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,554
With all due respect, captain...

71
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,569
This is the violent crime unit.

72
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,172
- We deal with the worst of the worst.
- Funny how he made it out.

73
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:15,908
Sergeant Peyton is an
excellent team leader.

74
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:20,858
Was a team leader. He's thorough.
He led them right into an ambush.

75
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,086
His recklessness caused all this.

76
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,802
With all due respect sir,
I think you're looking for a scapegoat.

77
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,863
Watch yourself, lieutenant.
Somebody didn't do their job right.

78
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,495
I'm saying it was him.

79
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,335
Keep up this attitude,
It could be you, too.

80
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:35,105
What?

81
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:38,208
Excuse me, sir?
Is that a threat?

82
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:39,538
Are you threatening me?!

83
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:42,210
- Stand down, Lieutenant!
- Are you threatening me?!

84
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,959
Lieutenant, Stand down!

85
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,859
Captain...

86
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,817
Captain... It's on me.

87
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,906
Just me.

88
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:42,657
You know, we should probably
get out of these chairs at some point.

89
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,072
Why would we do that?

90
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:48,002
I don't know, get some
exercise or something.

91
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,026
I came here to relax, besides...

92
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:56,956
It's a long walk to the bar.

93
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,000
I like your thinking.

94
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,890
You want another one?

95
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:14,078
Yes, please.

96
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,884
Another one what?

97
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,044
Stop.

98
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,570
Dorn!

99
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,943
Go get help!

100
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,285
No!

101
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:33,516
No, no!
What?

102
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,406
Shh..., It's okay.

103
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,002
I love you.

104
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,203
I love you.
You're gonna be okay.

105
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,320
You're gonna be okay.
Matt?

106
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,403
No, no, Matt!

107
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,149
Hi. I'm Lieutenant Efren Kalalo.

108
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,709
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

109
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,385
Look, I've been here for hours.

110
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:31,495
I've told everyone that
interviewed me exactly what I saw.

111
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,908
I've read your statement.

112
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,822
That must've been a horrific
experience for you.

113
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,550
We confirmed that your husband
was employed by the FBI back in states.

114
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,750
And to vacation in here,
as you told us.

115
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,680
So you believe my account of what happened.

116
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:52,474
Do you know if your husband was
involved with the perpetrators, in any way?

117
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:55,023
What do you mean?

118
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:59,851
Not counting your husband, we have
three dead. all innocent people.

119
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,509
We have a lot of gangs here,
and when they go to war they...

120
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,536
This wasn't a gang war.

121
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:08,976
I gave an exact description of the people
that I saw that were involved.

122
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:14,088
I appreciate that, It's just that there're
dozens of conflicting descriptions...

123
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:17,368
about the perpetrators
and what they look like.

124
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:20,266
I believe this man was in charge.

125
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:25,590
Impressive work.

126
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,980
I'm a police sketch artist.
Do you recognize him?

127
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,347
I'm not sure.

128
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,840
Can you wait here please?

129
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,755
This is detective Jovelyn Sabio
from the violent crime unit.

130
00:16:56,855 --> 00:17:00,425
Hello, Mrs.Wells.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

131
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,180
She would take you to a safe place.

132
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:36,223
Can we at least stop by my hotel first?

133
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:40,247
Sorry, It's too dangerous.

134
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:09,422
- What?
- Sorry.

135
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,860
I thought we had a tail.
It's safe now.

136
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,778
It's all right. We're okay.

137
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,758
Come on!

138
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:56,933
It's okay.

139
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:59,276
No!

140
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,885
You know those guys?

141
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,820
- No.
- But they know you.

142
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,720
That's why you can't
go back to your hotel.

143
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,110
You did good.

144
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,103
Okay, show me.

145
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,757
What's wrong?

146
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:54,560
I don't know, must be the batteries.
Up, there goes.

147
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,969
- That's my wife.
- Keep watching, Mr. Camato.

148
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,290
Who is that cret with Vivian?

149
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,884
His name is David Beckels,
he's a car salesman.

150
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,364
But it doesn't matter.

151
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:12,564
What do you mean?

152
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,114
Keep watching, Mr.Camato.

153
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,564
She has two lovers? Slut!

154
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,350
Keep watching, Mr.Camato.

155
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,990
- Three lovers?
- Clients.

156
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,820
She's a pro, Mr.Camato.

157
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,411
- A prostitute?
- A call girl, a high class call girl.

158
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:41,918
That's why she kisses on the lips.

159
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:43,518
Not that I know of.

160
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,424
Never should've married such a young woman.

161
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,420
You know, you don't watch anymore.

162
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,340
You don't... you don't wanna see this.

163
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,390
- It's gonna break your heart.
- Not again.

164
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,299
Sorry.

165
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,400
Surveillance photos.

166
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,840
We're really sorry you had to find out
about your wife this way, Mr.Camato.

167
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,532
It's what I paid you to do.

168
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,130
Thanks, Mr.Camato.

169
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,930
What was that, Charlie?

170
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,934
I forgot the camera was rolling.

171
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,280
Did you forget to don't
sleep with our clients too?

172
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,650
Technically she's not a client.

173
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,898
Hey, I don't have a hot girlfriend.

174
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,910
Wanna see it again?

175
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,100
- Hey Jovelyn, how's it going?
- It's going good, Nick.

176
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,500
I'd like for you to meet Sheryl Wells.

177
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,993
Charlie Benz, Private investigator.

178
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:37,030
What are we doing here?

179
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,290
Lieutenant Kalalo believes
that they can help you.

180
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,000
And who are they?

181
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,120
Nick Peyton was a sergeant
on the violent crime unit strike force.

182
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,580
And Charlie Benz
was a Los Angeles police officer.

183
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,394
Alright Mr. Peyton,
Why aren't you with the strike force anymore?

184
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,432
The bust went bad, we were set up
and I took the hit for it.

185
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,120
Mr. Benz, why aren't you with LAPD?

186
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,728
- It's complicated.
- He slept with his commander's wife.

187
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,060
I used to have a problem.

188
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,020
- He's a sex addict.
- I go to meetings now.

189
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,600
Look, Mrs. Wells, these men are
actually really good at what they do.

190
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,592
Trust me, they can help you.

191
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,492
Help with what?

192
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,760
As an FBI agent, my husband worked
with Interpol more than once.

193
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm guessing that you recognize this man
from one of his previous cases.

194
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,239
He's called The Wraith.

195
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,040
A police artist drew this
sketch for me, two years ago.

196
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,060
How the artist might've seen him before.

197
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,700
You think you can find him?

198
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,100
If he's back in this area, yes.

199
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,281
But you'll have to be
fast, because he moves

200
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,228
his space of operations
around, all the time.

201
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,328
Excuse me.

202
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:05,240
"The Wraith"?

203
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,613
The cold blooded human drug trafficker
that no one ever sees?

204
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:09,286
And if they do they end up dead.
Which is why

205
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:10,996
they call him "The Wraith"
in the first place.

206
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,120
- That's who we're going after?
- Yes.

207
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,800
But Jovelyn just said, He works globally.

208
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,387
He's probably not even in
the Philippines right now.

209
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,100
You lost an entire team,
and almost got killed.

210
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,930
And now It's rumor that
he has his own private army.

211
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,060
Great.

212
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,170
Why the hell can't
the police handle this?

213
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,550
Because Lieutenant Kalalo believes...

214
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:37,901
that some of the forces
actually are on The Wraith's payroll.

215
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:41,711
That's why Nick got set up,
When he went after Carlo Diaz.

216
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,686
Look, Mrs.Wells...

217
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,366
I feel for you, I really do.

218
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:53,193
But we work with fraud, cheating partners
and some daily scam cases.

219
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,126
I'll give you 50 thousands Us dollars,
if you find him.

220
00:24:57,226 --> 00:25:01,428
- We can look for him.
- Another 50 if you bring him to me.

221
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:03,680
I mean he can't hide forever.

222
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,302
- Does anyone know what his real name is?
- No.

223
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,680
Wonderful, I wanted for this.

224
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,880
You should take her somewhere safe.

225
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,280
I'll take her to my place.

226
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,284
The lieutenant says that
this is off the books.

227
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,090
Call him on his mobile phone,
only after you find the Wraith.

228
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,690
And Nick...

229
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,490
Don't forget that you still have friends.

230
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,923
- Where do you wanna begin?
- We check every resource we have.

231
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:45,144
- Somebody has to know something.
- The trouble's getting them to talk.

232
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,825
- Oh, we'll make them talk.
- We will make them talk?

233
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,870
- You're gonna go Godzilla on me?
- Godzilla?

234
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,204
Every time you take a case personal,
someone gets his head pounded.

235
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,750
- Not all the time.
- Most of the time.

236
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,188
- Some of the time.
- Almost every time.

237
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,748
So what? When you were a cop,
you didn't get passionate about your cases?

238
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:08,648
- When I was a cop?
- Yeah.

239
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,250
Work was work. I did my job,
I didn't take things personal.

240
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,740
That's what we're gonna do on this job.

241
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,340
We're private investigators,
not terminators.

242
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,271
If you want out.

243
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,191
I don't want out.

244
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,109
We're partners.

245
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,943
- And you want your cut of the money?
- I do.

246
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,430
My friend, we're looking for this guy.

247
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,890
No, I haven't seen him.

248
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,540
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

249
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,175
Okay.

250
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,022
We're getting nowhere fast.

251
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,010
- Nobody's seen a thing.
- Or they're covering up.

252
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,840
Probably scared of the Russian hulk.

253
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
We should've done this in my way.

254
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,520
And we would end it up in jail.

255
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,517
Look Nick, I know
how much this thing means to you.

256
00:28:24,637 --> 00:28:26,157
No, you don't.

257
00:28:26,257 --> 00:28:29,459
I got my whole team killed
by this son of a bitch. I owe him.

258
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,507
We'll get him, partner.
Something will turn up.

259
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,550
Sorry.

260
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,680
We're cool.

261
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,800
Hey, Nick. Charlie...

262
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,930
Hey.

263
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,720
Hi Zoya, how are your folks?

264
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,550
Good. business is great,
lots of deliveries.

265
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,230
Listen, you ride all over the city.
Have you seen him?

266
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,980
Who's he?

267
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,090
Someone very bad.

268
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,690
We really need to find him.

269
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,500
I can keep my eyes open.

270
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,954
Why don't you ask Kiki for help?
She's good at these stuff.

271
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:24,641
- She's away, In rehab.
- No, she's not.

272
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,890
I saw her in a club dress last night.

273
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,012
And I saw her with that Datu guy,
outside the Tiki lounge.

274
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,740
That's the first place we checked.

275
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Told you, we should've done this my way.

276
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,286
Do you always have to have the last word?

277
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,750
Absolutely.

278
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,390
- What are you having?
- Information.

279
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,090
I don't know about that guy.

280
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,920
Where can I find Datu?

281
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,897
Who is that?

282
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,800
No more lie!

283
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,070
I don't know anything of Datu!

284
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,090
- Where's Datu?
- I don't know, I don't know.

285
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:47,865
I don't speak Wookie, Chewbacca.

286
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,229
- Talk.
- No, no, no. I don't know.

287
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,140
Upstairs! Upstairs!

288
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,940
Upstairs.

289
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,880
Thank you.

290
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,650
- Nicolas Peyton.
- No shit.

291
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:43,873
Let him in.

292
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,350
- Hold your fire, bro.
- Relax.

293
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,330
Well, well, well!

294
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,890
Look at you.

295
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,153
What are you here for?
You're no longer a cop.

296
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:10,759
That's true, but I missed you so much
that I thought to stop by.

297
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,710
What do you want, Peyton?

298
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,287
First, Where's Kiki?

299
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:18,487
She's smoking pole...

300
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:21,425
- somewhere.
- I see.

301
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,590
You're still pissed you
can't have Kiki, right?

302
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,570
I don't know what you're
talking about, Peyton.

303
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,900
But I've been banging
Kiki, like a firecracker.

304
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,770
You know Bella, you should probably leave.

305
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,086
There've boyfriend over here,
he's going down.

306
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:44,486
Now!

307
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,882
It's time someone shuts your mouth for you.

308
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,280
Get him!

309
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,525
Datu!

310
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,600
As I said...

311
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,720
two questions.

312
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,620
First.

313
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,810
Where's Kiki?

314
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,290
Trina's seen her in...

315
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,530
Bagail street.

316
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,685
Second question.
Who is he?

317
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,025
I don't know, I don't know him.

318
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,440
Look again.

319
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:57,733
I told you. I don't know him!
I swear!

320
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,410
Leave Kiki alone.

321
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,695
I thought you were in the rehab.

322
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:09,295
It sucked, I had to leave.

323
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,136
And you moved out of your place?

324
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,896
My landlord wants favors again.

325
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,641
- Who is this?
- The Wraith.

326
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,520
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

327
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,897
I've never seen his face before.

328
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,320
But I've heard a lot about him, though.

329
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,730
This man, he caused us pain.

330
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,090
Me and Charlie are working for a woman now.

331
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,290
He took her husband in cold blood,
right in front of her.

332
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,210
Hello.

333
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,890
Hi. I'm Sofia,
and you must be...

334
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,343
That's Kiki, Our informant.

335
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,903
Hmm, cool.

336
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,800
So, this is the girlfriend.

337
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:09,035
I guess so.
You want some Chinese?

338
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,482
Yes, Chinese is very good.

339
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:14,122
We met in New York.
I was a cop and she was a journalist

340
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:15,282
I still am.

341
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,460
Back then, when I got
transferred to the Philippines,

342
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,300
Nick said, he wouldn't let me fly alone.

343
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,496
I followed her to Manila.
Finally got a job at the VCU.

344
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:26,816
The rest is history.

345
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:28,396
What can I say?

346
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,716
That's a really nice love story.

347
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,156
Thank you.

348
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,380
Anyway, I just stopped by
to remind you of our...

349
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,173
date on Friday?
Theater.

350
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,630
Don't you forget.

351
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,460
- Okay?
- I will not.

352
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,700
Thank you.
Bye, Kiki.

353
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,236
Say hi to Charlie from me, alright?

354
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,784
- I will, thank you.
- Bye.

355
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,500
Brought you Chinese food.

356
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,510
Sofia stopped by, she said hello.

357
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,150
There's one thing though.

358
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,454
I don't know if this is gonna mean much
but, I worked at Wraith's bar yesterday.

359
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:20,554
Oh, great Go-Go's there.

360
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,390
Or so I've heard.

361
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,680
Anyway, there was this guy,
This big guy.

362
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
And he had long blond hair.

363
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,440
Long blond hair?

364
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:32,695
Yeah, and...

365
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,695
His name was Dorn.

366
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,118
He likes the girls at Wraith's bar.

367
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:39,214
He's from out of town, so
he doesn't come around often.

368
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:41,318
But yesterday I saw him there.

369
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,826
Last time I saw him was two years ago.

370
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,100
When you were trying
to take down Carlo Diaz.

371
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:50,092
What time have you seen him yesterday?

372
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,710
- Around happy hour.
- Great time to go.

373
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,290
Appetizers are half off.

374
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,211
Okay.

375
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:02,577
You can stay here tonight.
We have a couch over there.

376
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:06,500
And Kiki, take it, take it.

377
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,660
But tomorrow you start to earn it.

378
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,750
You can clean up around here,
you can answer the phone.

379
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,080
And there's a secretary desk,
which is there to use it.

380
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,350
- We have a secretary desk?
- It's a secretary desk.

381
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,740
Looks like you've got
my whole day planned out for me.

382
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,120
Get used to it.

383
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,509
Bossy!

384
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,022
Bossy!

385
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:06,410
Hi.

386
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,310
- So how the meeting's going?
- Huh?

387
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,975
The sex addict anonymous meetings.

388
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:15,495
Oh, good, okay.
I guess.

389
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,200
You know, addiction control
is difficult with...

390
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,160
- So many neighbours out there.
- Neighbours?

391
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,990
Cute Filipino girls.

392
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,820
And they're beyond cute.

393
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,770
And keeping what I'm up against,

394
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,330
I'd say that myself discipline
is pretty impressive

395
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,530
You're my hero, Charlie.

396
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,360
Yeah, I know.
Hey, It's him.

397
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,760
We can't chat him up too much

398
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,360
We need him to talk.

399
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,940
Don't worry.

400
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:01,273
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Anton.

401
00:41:01,373 --> 00:41:05,500
- It's Peyton.
- She's there.

402
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:18,635
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey.

403
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:21,699
- Nice to see you again, Charlie.
- You too.

404
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:23,704
My neighbours, huh?

405
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,190
You no call me!

406
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,388
I was gonna call you,
We've been working a big case.

407
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,907
You want bang bang?!

408
00:41:38,027 --> 00:41:40,107
Hey, It's my colleague.

409
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,690
Peyton, Miss. Divina.
Miss Divina, Peyton.

410
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,032
- Peyton.
- Miss. Divina.

411
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:48,470
Okay, don't.

412
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,890
We're looking for someone.

413
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,720
He's big, almost like him,
blond hair.

414
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,598
- Dorn.
- Yeah.

415
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,090
I don't want no trouble here, Charlie.

416
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,090
When have I ever given you any trouble?

417
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,760
Okay, that was just that one time,
but...

418
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,800
Please.

419
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Thank you.

420
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,543
How do you wanna do this?

421
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,350
That'll do it.

422
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,610
Don't move!

423
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,440
Ladies, out.
Now!

424
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,018
- Who the hell are you?
- You don't remember?

425
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:12,118
You tried to kill me.

426
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:18,720
- If that were true, you'd be dead.
- But I'm not.

427
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,950
Palace hotel, roof top, 2 years ago.

428
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,780
Looks like you got lucky.

429
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,010
Alright, you can move with us now.

430
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,230
What?

431
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,980
- We need to talk.
- What are you, cops?

432
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,850
No.

433
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,519
Can't put it out, huh?

434
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:48,553
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm leaving now,

435
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,710
And If you're smart,
and that's a big If...

436
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,910
You forget that we ever met.

437
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,528
I know what you wanna talk about.
It's not gonna happen.

438
00:44:01,628 --> 00:44:05,940
You either shoot me,
or get the fuck out of my way.

439
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,550
Nick...

440
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:19,120
Or we're gonna go mano and mano,
and you can try to make me talk.

441
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,620
But I don't think your
balls are big enough.

442
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,920
Nick, What are you doing?

443
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,750
Put your gun away, Charlie.

444
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,350
Charlie, what's going on?

445
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:41,850
You still owe me money,
you only paid me 20!

446
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:51,326
Charlie, you told me no trouble!

447
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:54,493
What is...? what is going on here?

448
00:45:38,055 --> 00:45:39,939
Move!

449
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,288
- Hey mister, looking for someone?
- Two really big guys.

450
00:45:46,388 --> 00:45:49,229
- Are you police?
- Private investigator.

451
00:45:49,465 --> 00:45:51,959
Wow, so you're chasing bad guys?

452
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,159
Yeah, really bad guys.

453
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:55,819
- Did you see which way they went?
- They went through that gate.

454
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:57,881
- Yeah.
- Look, I can show you the better way.

455
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,580
Take it.

456
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,518
Sorry.

457
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:08,823
Move!

458
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,218
- I'm Larissa.
- I'm Charlie.

459
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:33,505
- I'm an exchange student, you know.
- How great.

460
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:36,055
- I won track in school.
- I don't doubt that.

461
00:46:40,185 --> 00:46:42,510
- Is this a big case?
- Breathing!

462
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,332
- I'm thinking of being an Olympic athlete.
- I believe you.

463
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:55,669
Look!

464
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:57,641
- It's him.
- Thanks.

465
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,480
Come on!

466
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,109
- I had this guy.
- I know you had him, buddy.

467
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,173
Wow!

468
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:31,293
You guys put some pain on him.

469
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:34,140
Although you might want balk up a bit.

470
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,723
Get a little more mass.
I should get a pic of this.

471
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,490
No, no, no photos.

472
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,720
You see, we're undercover.

473
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,280
Oh, cool!

474
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,064
Thank you. but you should go.

475
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,309
- And good luck at the Olympics.
- Thank you.

476
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,409
I'm gonna be a watcher for you.

477
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,890
- Olympics?
- What?

478
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:03,657
So you like Go-Go's girls, right?

479
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:06,776
Hey, hey!

480
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:08,776
You're about to lose your balls, man.

481
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,113
We're gonna ask you some questions,
and you answer them.

482
00:48:11,233 --> 00:48:13,113
Believe it, I've seen him do it.

483
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,763
Holy crap!

484
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,500
- Is he dead?
- Nope.

485
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,350
Just out.

486
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,180
He was getting us in trouble
and then we tied him up.

487
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,770
How can you blame him?

488
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:42,889
Okay, so now that I've seen that,
does that make me accomplice?

489
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,514
- Pretty much.
- For what?

490
00:48:44,614 --> 00:48:47,537
Kidnapping, discharging a
foreign army in public.

491
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,700
- Probably damage to lots out there.
- Yeah, that too. a lot of stuff.

492
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,438
I thought you guys only
did like kiddy spouses,

493
00:48:53,538 --> 00:48:55,308
Dating fraud, stuff like that.

494
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:57,108
So did I.

495
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,340
- Is this like when you are a cop?
- Actually was.

496
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,230
You know, Kiki, It's important
that Dorn will stay in the trunk by now.

497
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,900
If anyone stop by, looking
for him or for us...

498
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,311
- Be polite, be professional...
- And lie!

499
00:49:10,411 --> 00:49:11,760
You've never heard of Dorn.

500
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,680
Tell we're on the infidelity case.

501
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,189
- What if the cops come by?
- Lie again.

502
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,449
Tell them nothing,
they could work for Aldric Cole.

503
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,930
- Who's that?
- The Wraith.

504
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,920
- Or at least that's Dorn said.
- So I'm working for you now?

505
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,594
- Yep, that's the plan, if you want.
- Okay.

506
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:31,960
- But I want a raise.
- Haven't offered a salary yet.

507
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,100
Yeah, but when you do,
it's gonna be too low.

508
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,900
You hired her.

509
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,844
- We gotta go.
- Yeah.

510
00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:40,799
- A raise?
- Raise.

511
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:49,365
- She came in a minute.
- She's a good woman.

512
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:53,890
I know you, something big is happening.

513
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,890
Please, tell me what's going on.

514
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,790
I told you it's nothing

515
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,410
I care about you, don't shut me out

516
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,831
okay, I have to do something.
Part business, part personal.

517
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,110
How dangerous is it?

518
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,094
Don't you dare miss the
theater night on Friday.

519
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,250
I won't, I promise.

520
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,560
Don't worry.

521
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,010
Bye.

522
00:50:31,444 --> 00:50:33,244
You think Dorn left the place?

523
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,160
I think he wanna do keep his balls.

524
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:44,289
I just hope I can read his handwriting.

525
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,737
Sir.

526
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,585
Nick?

527
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,057
Lieutenant, I think I've found The Wraith.

528
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,954
I need some help.

529
00:51:00,054 --> 00:51:01,646
Where are you?

530
00:51:01,746 --> 00:51:05,296
I'll give you my location, but listen,
I need my friends.

531
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:56,120
Peyton, don't tell me you're
still a lowlife gunshu?

532
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,690
You surprised me, Ford.

533
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,650
I thought you'd be beach bencher by now.

534
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,910
Barking at others to meter maids.

535
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,946
Well, you know the Three Stooges, right?

536
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,230
Yeah, I've seen a few of their films.

537
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,299
I see you're still getting
your butt kicked.

538
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:16,939
And I see you're still nagging me
when I do, Hainse.

539
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:18,638
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

540
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:22,102
- It's been a while, Peyton.
- For a long, my friend.

541
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:33,070
Guys, this is Charlie.
He's my friend, you can comment him.

542
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,900
Charlie, Haines, Ford,
Dillon, and Victor.

543
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,105
Great to meet you all.
Another Russian, huh?

544
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:42,445
Yeah, there is more than one into work.

545
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,500
I was talking about speaking Russian.

546
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,890
It's called bilingual.

547
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,599
You know what's called
when you speak only one language?

548
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,120
What?

549
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,520
American.

550
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,880
They're just bursting your balls pall,
We do it all the time.

551
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,932
You see, We all used to
work together with Nick.

552
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:01,120
Understood.

553
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,080
I work with him now.

554
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,890
Alright, let's get this out of the way.

555
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,310
We all know you got set up by the Brasol...

556
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,500
in PR, Nick.

557
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,311
Everybody knew it was bullshit.

558
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:14,591
Absolutely.

559
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,933
Enough of this.

560
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,893
Let's kick some ass.

561
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,360
I see you came hard.

562
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,050
Well, we set stuff the best we could.

563
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,630
- And I brought a few things to go boom.
- Not bad.

564
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,380
That wasn't creepy.

565
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,330
You've gotta see this.

566
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,370
Dorn told the truth.

567
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,270
They're getting ready to move.

568
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,620
Figures, he's always on the move.

569
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,420
Can we get eyes on him?

570
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,610
Check out the tent.

571
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,740
It's Aldric Cole.

572
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,790
That son of a bitch.

573
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,144
You know what, Charlie,
screw the money.

574
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:51,160
You do that, he'll know
exactly where we're at.

575
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,866
We can still get him.

576
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,320
I can take out those.

577
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,120
At least they won't be able
to tell the others where it's coming from.

578
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,220
What about the fifty?

579
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,467
- Who is the quickest runner?
- Me!

580
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,234
Think you can take the one in the fifty's?

581
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:47,089
I can make it to the first one,
but I'm gonna need a lot of cover.

582
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:48,329
Will diversion help?

583
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:49,889
Yeah, a lot.

584
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,227
You see the gun snipers?

585
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:55,047
That would be the biggest problem.

586
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:57,287
Hit again, I don't know
of how many are them.

587
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,850
You can end up stepping on them.

588
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,820
Call lieutenant, get the rest of
the forces back up.

589
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,008
Yeah, in the moment we
do that there's a good

590
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,120
chance he'll get tipped
off, they'll be gone.

591
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,970
If we want to get him,

592
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,990
We're gonna have to to this on our own.

593
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,290
But It's up to you.

594
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,430
Let's do it.

595
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:37,624
I can make it down that
bridge, get out their rides.

596
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,980
- That'll be the diversion.
- Good enough.

597
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,890
Victor, where can you get the best shot?

598
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,220
Right there.

599
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:48,040
Charlie, Ford, and me,
we'll take this side.

600
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,210
And try to be up to the
tent to grab the Cole.

601
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,940
Hey Victor, give us ten.

602
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,200
Before we get to the position
and after that take out the OPS.

603
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,330
And Haines, as soon as you
get to one of the fifty's...

604
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,490
take it, we need a fire power.

605
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,890
You've got it.

606
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:06,809
One question. when we get this Cole
asshole, what do we do with him?

607
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:10,130
Take him alive. Me and Charlie are
supposed to bring him to Mrs. Wells.

608
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,030
For what?

609
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,590
We didn't ask.

610
01:00:19,497 --> 01:00:21,532
I can not find Dorn.

611
01:00:26,452 --> 01:00:27,692
Go!

612
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,910
Get down!

613
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,471
Go, go, go!

614
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:14,120
Batman and Robin come to save the day

615
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,080
Bravo...

616
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,010
I wish I could offer you a cigar, but...

617
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,899
that ain't my way

618
01:12:24,099 --> 01:12:25,699
You're coming with us.

619
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,650
Rather not.

620
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,690
You blew up my lab,
you killed all my men.

621
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,920
Wouldn't it be hard to believe
that I fought back and got away?

622
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,680
Not this time.

623
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,915
You know, I've got international
friends in law places.

624
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,510
Who wouldn't be happy if I were arrested.

625
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,710
We're not here to arrest you.

626
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,510
As I said, you're coming with us.

627
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:09,287
Good job

628
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,980
Hey, Cole!

629
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:25,970
Take a good look. come on, take it!

630
01:14:19,032 --> 01:14:21,778
- You okay?
- Cold.

631
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,330
Cold?

632
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:26,490
It's so cold in Russia,

633
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:31,394
I used to have an Ice fish
in Czech in my bathtub base with my bear.

634
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,450
Alright.

635
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,194
Let's go.

636
01:14:40,339 --> 01:14:42,120
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

637
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,720
Good bye.

638
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,560
Next time you wanna take
down some bad guys,

639
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,080
count me in.

640
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:56,020
I promise to you. Thanks for everything.

641
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,942
Next time you need your hand health,
make sure you give me a call.

642
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,977
You must be there.

643
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,110
I'll be right back.

644
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

645
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:08,577
- You did good out there.
- Thanks.

646
01:15:08,677 --> 01:15:10,870
I was wondering...

647
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:13,770
Would you like to go out with me sometime?

648
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,496
I'll go out with you.

649
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,810
But if you cheat on me...

650
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:27,441
I'll kill you.

651
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:30,075
Call me.

652
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,912
If you ever get tired of work in VCU,

653
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:42,712
You can be PI very fast.

654
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,160
Are you kidding me?
That's too boring.

655
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:49,507
The lieutenant has a doctor
that will take care of Victor,

656
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:52,700
- No questions asked.
- Good.

657
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,712
What are you gonna do with Cole?

658
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:01,245
I don't know. It's up to Mrs.Wells.

659
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,804
He doesn't go to jail.

660
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:13,180
Let us know if you need a cleaner.

661
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,481
- I will, thank you.
- Alright.

662
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,592
It would've never worked out
between her an I.

663
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,074
She's here.

664
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,340
Thanks, send him in.

665
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:17,318
Hey, Kiki, you can go home now.
I'll see you tomorrow.

666
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,829
But... but I thought that...

667
01:17:20,029 --> 01:17:23,309
No, just lock the front
door on your way out.

668
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:25,769
Do it.

669
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:39,096
This is Aldric Cole, The Wraith.

670
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,510
And Dorn, as viki.

671
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,699
We've seen your social club.
Can we get on with this?

672
01:17:44,839 --> 01:17:47,730
Shut up!

673
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,050
You murdered my husband, Matthew.

674
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,370
He didn't stand a chance
considering the odds against him.

675
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,030
Matthew was a good man.

676
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,305
Good husband.

677
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:05,390
And an excellent marksman.

678
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,685
He taught me all about guns.

679
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:11,085
How to shoot them.

680
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:14,387
That's so touchy.

681
01:18:14,587 --> 01:18:16,147
Are you done?

682
01:18:16,347 --> 01:18:17,947
No.

683
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,473
Am I to arrest?

684
01:18:48,988 --> 01:18:50,788
No.

685
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,819
Detective Sabio, I need
a car to the airport,

686
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:58,789
transporting my husband's body back home.

687
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:00,509
Okay, Mrs. Wells.

688
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,157
Your money will be in your accounts...

689
01:19:08,169 --> 01:19:10,200
before the end of the day tomorrow,
is that alright?

690
01:19:10,369 --> 01:19:12,041
Yeah.

691
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:16,723
Mr. Peyton, Mr. Benz,
Thank you.

692
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,163
Send it down to me cleaners.

693
01:19:21,263 --> 01:19:23,689
Done.

694
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:32,610
What are we gonna do now?

695
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,390
We'll sit down and wait for cleaners.

696
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:04,368
I took these off from
Cole when I cuffed him.

697
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,689
He won't need them in where he's at.

698
01:20:07,529 --> 01:20:09,489
That's true.

699
01:20:35,737 --> 01:20:37,505
Not bad.

700
01:20:40,056 --> 01:20:42,056
