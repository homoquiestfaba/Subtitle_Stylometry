1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,753
Now, I want you to try and tell us
everything that happened.

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,592
Anything you can remember.

3
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,350
I can't, I can't remember.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,478
We need your help so we can
find the other children.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,988
A house.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,158
- What?
- They took us to a house.

7
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,197
- Who?
- I don't know. People.

8
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,829
Do you think the other children
are still there?

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,198
Do you think they've been hurt?

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,108
Yes.

11
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,557
You're doing just fine.
We're going to find them.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,272
But we need you to tell us more.
You've got to try and remember.

13
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,629
I can't, I can't remember anything.

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,191
Shit!

15
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,199
- Drink it.
- But...

16
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,556
No complaints. Drink.

17
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,198
- Did you get 'em?
- Get what?

18
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,395
The pencils.

19
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,316
Yeah.

20
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,027
Has he had breakfast?

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,198
- We're on it. How did it go?
- I'm bushed.

22
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,836
I think it's going to take me a while
to get used to it,

23
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,638
and on top of that,
night shifts.

24
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,557
Don't worry,
you're just starting.

25
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,792
Anyhow I'm going to my father
about getting your shift changed.

26
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,995
We'll see.

27
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,668
Do you know
where the toaster is?

28
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,550
I have no idea.

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,753
We still have tons
of boxes left to open.

30
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,875
Unless you give me a hand,
I give up.

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,029
Hey, big guy.

32
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,156
Hi.

33
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,956
- Today's your first day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,151
- You nervous?
- A little.

35
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,358
You'll see that you'll like it.
You'll make lots of friends soon.

36
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,315
Come on, Paul.

37
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,233
You're gonna be late,
come on.

38
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,396
Bye.

39
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,552
It's about time.

40
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,117
I was just about to get you up.

41
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,033
We've got to do.

42
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,793
It's too early.

43
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,072
And I have swim practice.

44
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,552
That's not for two hours.

45
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,067
And travel.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,988
This is the sticks,
I have to take the bus everywhere.

47
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,512
I'm not waiting any longer for this
to start looking like a real house.

48
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,351
We've been here almost three weeks,

49
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,389
and with the notable
exception of myself,

50
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,959
one has unpacked one single box.

51
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,074
And don't forget, you promised you
were going to paint your room.

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,074
Mom, I don't...
I don't know if I'm staying.

53
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,439
I thought we discussed this, Reggie.

54
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,677
You know how your father
and I feel.

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,829
When have you
ever listened to me?

56
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,673
I just want to finish
school in the States with my friends.

57
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,952
Is that so abnormal?

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,478
- Hi.
- Hi.

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,319
What are you doing here?

60
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,829
You're crazy.

61
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,798
I'm not doing anything wrong.

62
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,312
I'm just here to pick up
my American friend.

63
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,079
Well, you got here too late
'cause I got to go.

64
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,757
Just tell me if you're gonna stay.

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm not.

66
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,117
- Come on, you got to go.
- Why not?

67
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,312
Go, please.

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,555
They saw you.

69
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,475
- We'll talk about it later.
- Promise?

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,629
I promise.

71
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,189
I'm warning you,

72
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,079
it's not going to be easy for your
family to live in another country.

73
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,394
Especially for the kids.

74
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,952
Oh, I know. It's a big move.
I'm sure hoping they'll get used to it.

75
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,872
It's a great place.

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,394
Think so?

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,353
It needs work.

78
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,632
Yeah, That's true.

79
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,471
A hammer and nails and a bit
of paint, you'll see.

80
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,196
Plus I got one month
before semester starts.

81
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,235
Good luck.

82
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,872
Did you meet?

83
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,596
- No. Hi.
- How ya doing?

84
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,831
I was just saying,
it's like a dream come true.

85
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,831
You know what? He's lying.

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,632
You don't want to play anymore?

87
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,713
Oh, thanks.

88
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,434
Everybody seems to be having
a good time, right?

89
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,475
Paul reminds me of Mark
when he was that age.

90
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,069
Before...

91
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,668
he left.

92
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,788
Now you'll have your grandchildren
all to yourself

93
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,197
and you're gonna get sick of them.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,988
Yes.

95
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,637
It must be strange for them.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,999
Poor Paul.

97
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,433
He'll end up crazy about you.
You'll see.

98
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,518
I'm gonna get jealous.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,913
It's good to see you, dad.

100
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,635
That's it. It's over.

101
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,549
Finally.
I thought it would never end.

102
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,712
Way to close a party.

103
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,753
Not again.

104
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,232
...experts suggest to be cautious.
Never look directly at the sun,

105
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,197
nor the optlcal device.

106
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,118
So take care, but make sure not to miss
it, Don't forget it's a unique event,

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,707
A very special eclipse

108
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,272
that takes place only every 40 years
and there are just 5 days to go.

109
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,798
- You lived here with grandpa?
- Yeah, when I was your age.

110
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,158
That's when you left for the States?

111
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,197
Why did you have to?

112
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,710
Well, your grandparents decided
to split up and...

113
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,510
I didn't have a choice
I had to go.

114
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,193
With your mom?

115
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,149
That's right.

116
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,318
Are you and mom going

117
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,312
- To split up?
- No.

118
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,590
Only families that don't get
along split up.

119
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,871
We get along,
don't we?

120
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,590
Yeah.

121
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,876
It's the second day and I bet
I'm the only one late.

122
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,509
Don't worry. You'll make it.

123
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,837
'We're like the lonely wildebeest

124
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,078
bleating his plaintive poetry
to the infinite herd."

125
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,317
Hey dad, do you even know
what a wildebeest is?

126
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,436
Sure it's...

127
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,711
It's like a cow.

128
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,273
And what's your cow saying?

129
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,789
"Get your ass

130
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,591
out of my face."

131
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,390
"Get your ass

132
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,153
out of my face."

133
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,591
Dad look, it worked.

134
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,556
Dad?

135
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,115
Hey, shithead,
what are you doing? Move it!

136
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,672
Fuck!

137
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,596
Help me!

138
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,754
Help me!

139
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,309
Please!

140
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,716
- When was his last attack?
- More than ten years ago.

141
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,355
Haughtlngton is unpredictable,
but it doesn't have to be serious.

142
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,313
As quickly as it has come,
it can go.

143
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,349
I don't know.

144
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,596
I'm going to give him Haloperidol.

145
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,868
But if he does have an attack,
you know about the risk of choking.

146
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,278
Just keep a close eye on him.

147
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,836
This couldn't come
at a worse time.

148
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,153
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

149
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,355
Trust me.

150
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,989
Dad.

151
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,953
I'm okay, sweetie.
Nothing's happened.

152
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,273
Come on, let's go inside.

153
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,552
We've still got a lot
of work ahead of us.

154
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,634
This is going to be the best house
in the whole world.

155
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,035
Mom?

156
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,955
What happened?

157
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,110
Your father had a small attack,

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,479
but it's nothing,
don't worry.

159
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,631
I've been talking
to your grandfather.

160
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,232
He's got to go back on medication
for a while and that's all.

161
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,150
Mom.

162
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,668
It's starting again.

163
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,668
Nothing is starting again.

164
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,037
This is an isolated incident.
Don't blow it out of proportion.

165
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,232
You remember what happened.

166
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,278
You know exactly what this is.

167
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,107
And just now.

168
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,873
Just now what?

169
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,309
We're completely isolated.
What if something were to happen?

170
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,830
We're ten minutes away from
downtown and I already told you,

171
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,068
nothing's going to happen.

172
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,238
- Mom.
- What?

173
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,711
If you don't like this house
or your family,

174
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,428
then get your things and go.

175
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,190
Isn't that what you wanted, to go?

176
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,875
Well, go on then!

177
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,958
I think we'll survive.

178
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,832
Since the beginning of time,

179
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,230
people considered this phenomenon
in different ways.

180
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,471
But how do eclipses exactly work?

181
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,677
- Feeling better?
- No.

182
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,236
Come on, I fight
with my Mom all the time.

183
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:03,950
It's normal.

184
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,108
No it's not.

185
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,518
She's never been this cruel before.

186
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,632
I bet she didn't even notice.

187
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,357
- Sometimes people say things that...
- I don't care.

188
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,473
I'm not comfortable.

189
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,191
I don't feel happy in that house.

190
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,758
- Hey there, Tiger.
- Hi.

191
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,115
What are you doing?

192
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,596
Drawing.

193
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,518
You don't play with this anymore.

194
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,199
You used to like it.

195
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,595
Are you going to die?

196
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,634
No.

197
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,510
Listen buddy, what happened
is that your dad...

198
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,712
I got a little too tense

199
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,949
this morning.

200
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,878
Forget about it.

201
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,628
You're not going to let

202
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,313
that worry you, are you?

203
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,914
Come on,

204
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,275
time for bed.

205
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,595
Dad,

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,875
don't.

207
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,630
Come on,

208
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,911
lights out.

209
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,869
- You okay?
- Yeah.

210
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,108
What are you doing up?

211
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,199
I couldn't sleep.

212
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,150
Dad said I couldn't leave
a light on.

213
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,438
- Since when are you afraid of the dark?
- I'm not.

214
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,270
So?

215
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,915
It's different here the dark.

216
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,714
What do you mean?

217
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,673
It eats my pencils.

218
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,878
Come on, I'll tell you what, how'bout
we make a deal? I'll lie down with you

219
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,076
- Until you fall asleep.
- Promise?

220
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,435
Of course.

221
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,348
Just give me a minute.

222
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,914
Okay.

223
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,030
- I can't find anything wrong.
- There's definitely something wrong.

224
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,919
Maybe you should check again.

225
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,275
I don't know what it could be.

226
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,397
Look, I'll check the sockets.

227
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,509
Where's my drawing pad?
I left it here last night.

228
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,153
- These are kind of wierd drawings.
- They're not wierd.

229
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,992
They're just drawings.

230
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,430
Yeah, but you keep on doing
the same thing.

231
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,477
They're not the same.
They're different.

232
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,273
They look the same to me.

233
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,833
That's because they're all children.

234
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,393
But they're different children.

235
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,596
Paul.

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,273
What's this?
Did you hurt yourself?

237
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,954
I don't know.

238
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,627
Has mom seen it?

239
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,474
Yeah. She says I probably did it
in my sleep.

240
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,798
When it was dark.

241
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,194
I'm going.

242
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,511
If you go outside,
don't go near the road. Okay?

243
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,308
Okay.

244
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,594
What are you doing here?

245
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,029
I need to use up the last few frames
on this roll and you will be my model.

246
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,792
I like you as a photographer, but I
think I like you better as a painter.

247
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,719
Oh, Dad, this is Carlos.

248
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,951
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

249
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,637
Do you know anything
about electricity?

250
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,516
No.

251
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,349
Come on.

252
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,792
It doesn't look like mold,

253
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,469
it's more like... rust.

254
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,355
I don't understand.

255
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,355
They painted the whole house
before we moved in.

256
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,829
Trust me, baby,

257
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,353
this is going to look great.

258
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:45,915
It better.

259
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,516
And I'm gonna go get
some paint thinner, just in case.

260
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,836
If you want,
phone the electric company.

261
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,558
The hell with that, there's
something here that doesn't work.

262
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,191
We've been here for three weeks now,
and every day the lights go out.

263
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,393
They flicker, like the voltage dropped.
Do you understand?

264
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,837
Look, if I were you,
I'd talk to the neighbors.

265
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,432
If it's a supply thing,
they'll have noticed something too.

266
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,750
What neighbors?
We don't have neighbors.

267
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,108
This is a fucking nightmare.

268
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,278
Calm down, okay?
I've done all I can.

269
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,556
In other words, fuck you, right?

270
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,790
In my own house. And to my face.
Fuck you!

271
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,758
Well, you're not getting
a penny from me. Not a goddamn penny.

272
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,391
The insurance company will pay me
either way. Tell it to them.

273
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,355
Not now.

274
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,634
What's wrong?

275
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,191
I'm staying.

276
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,838
I can't leave now.

277
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,718
I'm not going to ask you why.

278
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,513
That's probably a good idea.

279
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,270
What are you doing up?
It's late.

280
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,188
I was waiting up for you.

281
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,788
I'm bushed.

282
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,990
I hope you painted
that room.

283
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,239
I need to talk to you.

284
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,556
Tomorrow. I'm wrecked.

285
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,994
You can't imagine
how busy it's been today.

286
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,673
Why can't wejust talk?

287
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,873
Theres something I need to tell you.

288
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,832
You say not to worry,

289
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,356
but Dad is a bundle of nerves.

290
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,148
You should have seen the way he blew
up at the electrician this morning.

291
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,752
Oh, he's just...

292
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:46,994
- And like, Paul's not well. I mean...
- Paul's okay.

293
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,798
Look at the drawings.

294
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,039
I mean, does this look like the kind

295
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,032
of thing normal kids do? I mean...

296
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,950
He's a kid. You should have seen
the ones you used to make. Come on.

297
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,029
Don't touch it!

298
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,710
Sorry.

299
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,915
These old things
can be pretty delicate.

300
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,395
What's that?

301
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,750
A room. Hidden behind the wall.

302
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,508
How did you know it was there?

303
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,988
Paul told me.

304
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,673
Hey, check it out.

305
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,872
What about hanging it here?

306
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,473
Fuck!

307
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,430
It works.

308
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,031
That's the beauty
of old things,

309
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,478
no electricity required.

310
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,430
I'll stop it.

311
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,875
No.

312
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,674
And you, little psychic, how did
you know that room was there?

313
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,151
What are you talking about?

314
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,269
- Dad said you told him it was there.
- I didn't say anything. That's a lie.

315
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,715
You want to be a martyr,
fine.

316
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,315
If you keep this up,
I don't know what we'll do.

317
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,154
What's going on?

318
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,833
Nothing. Your brother's gone and
bruised himself again. That's all.

319
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,029
Clumsy.

320
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,358
Who did this to you?

321
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,153
Oh, Reggie. Don't start.

322
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,627
Please, don't get paranoid.

323
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,429
Don't get paranoid?
This has happened twice.

324
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,113
Are you trying to tell me
there's nothing going on?

325
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,635
That's not what I'm saying. All
I'm saying is these things happen.

326
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,919
He's got to be more careful,
that's all.

327
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,070
Mom, why do you refuse to see what
is staring you clearly in the face?

328
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,991
This is not normal.

329
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,832
We'll talk to your grandpa. Maybe
he can talk to Paul. I don't know.

330
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,307
What more
do you want me to do?

331
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,835
I need to get the rust off the floor.
Where did you guys put the matt knife?

332
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,791
I was opening boxes yesterday.
It's gotta be in there somewhere.

333
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,269
I don't understand you.

334
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,509
- Honestly, I don't.
- What's going on here?

335
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,828
Everything's fine. Great.

336
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,275
Couldn't be better,
right, mom?

337
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,317
Fantastic. Maybe you ought
to unpack something.

338
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,595
What's up?

339
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,751
You said you weren't going
to ask me why.

340
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,469
What?

341
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,759
Why I'm staying.

342
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:31,915
And?

343
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,598
I wanted you to ask me.

344
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,596
My dad's kind of sick.

345
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,355
He has this disease.

346
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,838
It's called
"Haughtington's Syndrome".

347
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,596
Just before Paul
was born it got really bad.

348
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,790
He was having attacks.

349
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,708
But you can't imagine

350
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,752
what it must be like
to be afraid of your own father.

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,308
But...
he's okay now.

352
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,352
The treatment took.

353
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,512
He's been fine for years
until now.

354
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,835
Until now?

355
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,709
He's not doing so good.

356
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,874
And there's definitely
something wrong with Paul.

357
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,114
He's woken up
with bruises twice now.

358
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,112
Hold on.

359
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,796
- You don't think?
- I don't think anything.

360
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,829
He's acting weird
and he barely speaks.

361
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,993
Sometimes I think it's that house.

362
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,154
You know, this thing is much
more complicated than it looks.

363
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,476
Where's Paul?

364
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,558
Grandfather came to talk to him.
They're upstairs.

365
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,588
- I'm a mother. Mothers worry.
- Don't worry.

366
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,515
Regina...

367
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,829
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't get to see you.

368
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:06,875
Hi, grampa.

369
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,958
- You're going to catch a cold.
- Dry off, hon.

370
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,989
Try and get him to stay
for dinner.

371
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,396
Thanks again.

372
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,114
How are you?

373
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,393
I'm good. And Paul?

374
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,675
He's fine.

375
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,233
I'm sure this is no big deal.

376
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,873
The change of houses,

377
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,311
habits, environment.

378
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,311
But he's never been afraid
of the dark before.

379
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,315
I don't think that Paul's fear
of darkness is your biggest concern.

380
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,032
Why would he hurt hinself?

381
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,838
He'sjust trying to call attention.

382
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,838
But Dad's been strange too.

383
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,393
He's worse.

384
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,829
He's aggressive

385
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,389
- Like he used to be.
- That's nonsense, Regina.

386
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,557
I know what you all went through.
And I know it wasn't easy.

387
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,349
But your father

388
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,873
is under control now.

389
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,835
You need to stop worrying.
Nothing is going to happen.

390
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,471
- All right, dear?
- Thanks, granpa.

391
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,394
And now, I'm off.

392
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,391
He says
we shouldn't worry.

393
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,909
Kids do strange things sometimes.

394
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,755
We have to find a place
to hang that picture.

395
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,878
I don't know...

396
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,838
Mark, please.
We're talking

397
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,114
about our children.

398
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,077
They're going through a rough time.

399
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,230
Reggie...

400
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,797
she's at a difficult age.

401
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,195
Maybe we're not being understanding
enough with her.

402
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,269
And what about me?

403
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,438
Who's being understanding with me?

404
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,911
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, please.

405
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:49,869
You don't think

406
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,509
I hear the little secret conversations
that go on behind my back?

407
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:53,871
You're losing it.

408
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,797
Right. Exactly. That's exactly
the attitude I'm talking about.

409
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:58,956
Thank you.

410
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,077
I know where they get it from now.

411
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,273
Mark, please, calm down.

412
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,717
Did you take your medication?

413
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,396
Mark!

414
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,351
Mark?

415
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,074
Mark!

416
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,309
Regina!

417
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,190
Mom?

418
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,956
Reggie, quickly!

419
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,228
Come over here.

420
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,748
I'm feeling kinda woozy.

421
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,318
Slow breaths, okay?

422
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,358
Hold it.
I have to get the alcohol.

423
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,195
Not now!

424
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,956
Mom!

425
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:35,789
Mom!

426
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,556
Mom!

427
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,427
Where's the fuse box?

428
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,394
In the laundry room.

429
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,715
Reggie!

430
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,675
Paul?

431
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,795
Paul, what's the matter?
Let me in.

432
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:41,789
They won't let me.

433
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,715
- There's someone here.
- Paul, let me in.

434
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,510
I can't.

435
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,438
- Paul!
- Dad!

436
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,469
Shut up!

437
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,548
You're scaring him!

438
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,108
I said, stop it! Dad!

439
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,715
Open this door right now!

440
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,237
Mom!

441
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,150
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

442
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:09,916
Let me go!

443
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,469
Stop!

444
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,798
Paul, honey, come here.
It's okay.

445
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,110
It's okay.

446
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,876
It's okay.

447
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,275
I don't know.

448
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,639
I got scared.
We couldn't open the door.

449
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,391
Baby,

450
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,914
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong with you?

451
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,231
I'm here now. It's okay.
It's all over.

452
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:17,039
It's not all over.

453
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,552
They never go away.
They only hide.

454
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,954
Who? What are you talking about?

455
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,516
The kids.

456
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,748
What kids?

457
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,711
The ones in my room.
They wouldn't let me out.

458
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,632
They hate me.
They say I'm an impostor.

459
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:41,396
Paul,

460
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,677
there's no one else here.

461
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,867
Just you and me,

462
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:49,947
and mom and dad.

463
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,353
Those kids don't exist.

464
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,873
You're imagining them.

465
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,713
Yes they do.
They come out when it's dark.

466
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,358
They live in the dark.

467
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,278
Didn't you hear them?

468
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:07,594
Didn't you?

469
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,753
- Hello.
- Carlos?

470
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,197
- Reggie, is it late?
- I know. I know, I'm sorry.

471
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,679
I need your help.

472
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,188
What's wrong?

473
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,315
It's this house.

474
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,630
Nobody has ever lived
in your house before.

475
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,793
The guy who sold the house
to your father

476
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,833
doesn't even exist.

477
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:13,233
Neither does the real estate agent
or the lawyer.

478
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,436
And the phone number that's on the
contract has never been in service.

479
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,072
So there's nothing we can check?

480
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,755
Maybe. I found some information
about the architect.

481
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,309
Great.

482
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,434
Excellent. Wanna help me?

483
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,117
Where's Regina?

484
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,429
She left at the crack of dawn.
I don't know.
