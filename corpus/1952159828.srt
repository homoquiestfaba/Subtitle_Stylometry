00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,701
(male voice on radio)
The I- 10 Santa Monica
Freeway westbound

2
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,833
is jammed due to
a three-car accident...

3
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,503
blocking lanes one and two
just past Hoover Street.

4
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,139
In Van Nuys there's
stop and go traffic
on the 405 southbound...

5
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,206
(Emma)
Hey, loser!
Get up. You're late.

6
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,883
We need money.

7
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,148
For what?

8
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,883
Food.

9
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,618
[sighs]

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,326
I've only got two dollars.
How much is a Happy Meal?

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,561
Oopf.

12
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,400
[light cheerful music]

13
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,030
(Manager)
Good morning, Thea.

14
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,438
Oh, hi.

15
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,635
There's this
thing called rent.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,701
Monday.
You have my word.

17
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,906
Could you
put your word
on an actual check?

18
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,211
[cheerful music]

19
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,044
(Miles)
Whoo! Look
at that foxy momma!

20
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,482
Hey.

21
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,181
Hey, look.
I, uh, I saved
you one of these.

22
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,383
It wasn't easy.
These people
are animals.

23
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,653
Thanks. It's
all downhill
after the donut.

24
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,854
Hey. Let's go
camping right now.

25
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,829
Oh, don't tempt
me. You know I can't.

26
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,891
Come on. Don't be
such a buzz kill. Just
call in sick from work.

27
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,698
Oh, Miles.
It was hard enough
getting Monday off.

28
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,467
Hey. You really
need to bail on
this lame job, babe.

29
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,068
Bailing isn't exactly in
my vocabulary right now.
I'm late. I'm late.

30
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,644
[depressing music]

31
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,345
Alarm clock
on the fritz again?

32
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,646
(Jerry)
Thea.

33
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,213
Thea!

34
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,394
Four minutes
after nine, Thea.

35
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,329
We agreed to 8:59.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,960
I know. I'm
sorry. I've got
your coffee piping hot.

37
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,470
Greg already
got it for me.

38
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,335
All right.
Let's get started.

39
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,171
I found two errors
in your transcription.

40
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:34,009
Ur-Nammu, the Mesopotamian
ruler, has a hyphen
in his name.

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,015
Are you sure? I checked it
in Oxford English Dictionary.

42
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,450
You should always
cross reference with
the Military Encyclopedia.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,010
It is
the definitive source.

44
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,578
Absolutely right, Greg.

45
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,454
The intern
shouldn't be more
thorough than you.

46
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,622
You have to remember
that every mistake you
make, impacts history.

47
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,631
I'm sorry
I didn't give
enough thought

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,167
to the long
reaching impact
of a missing hyphen.

49
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,499
Think of it next time,
or someone else will.

50
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,028
There are
a million people out there
who'd kill for your job.

51
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,634
The secretary
to the publisher, it's
a dream for so many of us.

52
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,179
I have a big
project for you.

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,944
Now, you can make
up for this morning's
mistakes by acing this one.

54
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,780
Okay. What
can I do for you?

55
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,413
MacArthur rolled
in some poop.

56
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,786
Again?

57
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,449
She's got one
good eye, Thea.

58
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,824
I don't appreciate
you taking that tone. Now.

59
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,927
Hi, there.
[dog whines]

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,959
Let's really try
and nail it this
time, shall we?

61
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,061
[sighs]

62
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,867
[whines]

63
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,340
[whines]

64
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,142
No way. She
rolled in poop again?

65
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,442
Uh-hm.

66
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,176
How come
Greg never
washes her?

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,775
I'm glad that I
don't have to wash
the poop off Greg

68
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,879
since he spends most
of his time with his
head up Jerry's ass.

69
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,925
Tell me about it.
Last week he CC'd
me on an email to Jerry

70
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,859
complaining that I ordered
too many rainbow Post-lts.

71
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,725
Said it creates
a party atmosphere.

72
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,890
Come here, MacArthur.

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,628
MacArthur.
[dog whines]

74
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,034
Do you think we'll
ever get out of here?

75
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,369
How long 'til
your little sister
graduates college?

76
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,432
Five years.
Five long years.

77
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,535
[sighs] Wow.

78
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,410
When you finally
ditch this place
I'm gonna leave, too.

79
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,642
I can't survive this
hellhole without you.

80
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,743
I don't even know
if I'm gonna survive
Monday without you.

81
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,118
Oh, well, your rainbow
Post-Its should help.

82
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,817
[fake laugh]
Ha, ha, ha.
Just promise me

83
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:30,261
that when you're celebrating
with Miles the big 25, you'll
have two extra shots for me.

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,924
Done. Two for
you, two for me

85
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,489
and two
for MacArthur.

86
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,728
And cold
beer chasers
and a sliced lime.

87
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,270
[sigh]
Gets me right here.

88
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,568
[rhythmic music]

89
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,932
What is MacArthur eating?

90
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,808
Oh, that's not
good. Hold on.

91
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,039
No, no, that's soap!

92
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,183
(Garth)
Well, Thea, you are
a sopping mess.

93
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,585
I know, I'm sorry.

94
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,850
Well, don't apologize.

95
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,585
(Carl)
This one
has two staples.

96
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,683
Yeah. And?

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,091
It's bad feng shui.

98
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,651
It'd be nice
to give the agenda

99
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,789
to the guy
the disability first.

100
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,799
When I gave you yours
first last month,

101
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,597
you reprimanded
me for giving you
special treatment.

102
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,968
I don't like your giving
me special back talk.

103
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,667
(Jerry)
Good morning, everyone.
Ready for Abbott?

104
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,800
[ringing]

105
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,241
Sorry.

106
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,108
(Abbot)
Let's have another round!

107
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,444
Hey, Johnny, my good man.
How's the book coming?

108
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,574
(Abbot)
Jerry!

109
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,811
War. What is
it good for?

110
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,788
Apparently lots
of things, Jerry.
[laughs viciously]

111
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,484
[whines]

112
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,425
If you could just tell
us what chapter
you're up to.

113
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,621
Sweet.

114
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,095
(Abbot)
Pigs in the blanket

115
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,257
for everybody on me.
[laughs and hangs up]

116
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,733
[chuckles]
Alright, bye-bye.
[clears throat]

117
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,895
(Jerry)
Hemingway used
to write in bars.

118
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,771
Ah. We're so pleased
you decided to bless us
with your presence, Nicky

119
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,833
Sorry, uh, bad,
bad traffic.

120
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,812
Hm. Got hung
up at the divorce
lawyer's office?

121
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,816
I kind of wanted that
to be private, Jerry.

122
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,409
Well, well, privacy is
for people who are on time.

123
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,477
(Nick)
So how's
Abbott's book coming?

124
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:07,288
Extremely well.
There's a method
to his mad genius.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,796
And now we're
ready to go over
the cost report.

126
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,854
Whenever you feel
like presenting it.

127
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,900
(Nick)
Oh, okay.

128
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,097
Sales for The Complete
History of Bullets are
below projections.

129
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,539
Uh, marketing says people
have been intimidated

130
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,439
by the 1400 page length.

131
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,139
(Garth)
There are a lot
of bullets in the world.
We're not making it up.

132
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,206
Let's talk
about the next order
of order of business.

133
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,685
(Jerry)
I've given this
a lot of thought.
[dog whines]

134
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,315
[sighs]
Next week's
softball game.

135
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,191
Now, we're all tired
of losing to Presidio.

136
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,491
So I'm moving Garth
to short stop.

137
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,361
I'm not
quite finished.

138
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,061
I've told you. You're
staying in left field.
We need you there.

139
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,728
This isn't softball related.

140
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,204
You know our
textbook writer,
Suzie Cavendish?

141
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,297
Of course I know her.

142
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,636
I read her new manuscript

143
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,506
and I thought
it was really good.

144
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,978
How did you
get a manuscript?

145
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,515
I ran into her at lunch.
She told me about her book.

146
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,017
You don't send
the accountant
your manuscript.

147
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,486
[dog whines]
Thanks, but I've already
told Suzie it's not for us.

148
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,352
It's not our
subject matter.

149
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,756
[dog whines and groans]
Baby, what's wrong?

150
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,125
(Jerry)
MacArthur?
[dog groans]

151
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,723
What's wrong with you?
Come here, baby.

152
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,394
What is wrong?
Talk to daddy.

153
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,629
[whines and retches]

154
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,167
(Thea)
Ew!

155
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,539
(Jerry)
What did you feed her?

156
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,839
I'm so so sorry
about your dog.

157
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,279
I just scheduled a full body
scan for MacArthur on Monday.

158
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,874
I have the day off Monday
but I'll take her Tuesday.

159
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,418
You'll take her Monday.

160
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,477
I asked for this time
off two months ago.

161
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,648
It's just one day.
I promised my boyfriend

162
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,658
we'd go camping
for his 25th birthday.

163
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,284
It's his 25th birthday?

164
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,555
Yeah, it is.

165
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,824
God, I had no idea.

166
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,423
I'm sorry. Why don't you
take the whole week off?

167
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,524
Really?

168
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,966
No!
[dog whines]

169
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,937
Okay, no problem.

170
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,065
(Lisa)
Come on, things
can't be that bad.

171
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,076
Okay. Let's see
what I have to look
forward to in life.

172
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,873
Washing my boss's dog.

173
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,777
Blow-drying my boss's job.

174
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,008
Uh-mm.

175
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,845
T aking my boss's
dog for a CAT scan.

176
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,783
I'm officially
a pathetic loser.

177
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,686
Well, at least
we still have
Skittles and cigarettes.

178
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,158
(Lisa)
Maybe you and Miles
can reschedule the weekend.

179
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,720
(Thea)
Oh, yeah. I'll
see if Miles can
reschedule his birthday.

180
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,595
No, maybe Jerry's
onto something.

181
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,864
Who needs a significant
other when you're dating
your own dog?

182
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,134
(Thea)
Jerry's repulsive.
Have you smelled
his breath lately?

183
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,333
He's lucky he can get
a dog to date him.

184
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,345
You know, it's one thing
if Jerry is an undersexed
jerk who takes no joy in life

185
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,849
But why does he have
to make the rest of us
that way? I hate him!

186
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,008
[door bangs open]

187
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,142
[both gasp]

188
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,914
In my office. Now!

189
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,452
You've got some pretty
strong opinions about
my personal choices.

190
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,654
You find my relationship
with MacArthur

191
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,128
something to deride?

192
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,563
Not at all.
I respect your
devotion to animals.

193
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,863
You're involvement
with PETA is inspiring.

194
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,061
Don't bullshit me.

195
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,535
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

196
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,766
It was childish
and it won't happen again.

197
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,637
If you hate me so much,

198
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,201
I don't really think
it's healthy for you
to continue working with me.

199
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,270
[gasps]
But, please.
You can't do this.

200
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,372
Watch me.

201
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,473
But I need this job.

202
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,574
Here I go.

203
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,675
I support my sister.

204
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,776
You're fired.

205
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,877
But I'm...

206
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,819
You're what? You're?

207
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,947
I'm pregnant.

208
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,116
Pregnant?

209
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,558
Yes, pregnant.
Totally pregnant.

210
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,961
The doctor says
the chemicals or
hormones or whatever...

211
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,127
are messing up my system
and you can't take anything
I say too seriously.

212
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,932
Except for when
I say I'm pregnant
because, I am.

213
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,205
(Thea)
Oh, God.

214
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,415
When are you due?

215
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,357
Octember.
I mean, October.

216
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,758
October what?

217
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,796
Uh, probably the 6th.
Could be the 7th,

218
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,458
could be the
8th. But fingers are
crossed for the 6th

219
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,626
by then I'll just want
this thing out of me.

220
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,636
You're almost four
months pregnant?

221
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,535
Yeah. [chuckles]
Isn't that crazy?

222
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,736
Feels like yesterday
I wasn't. But I was
because I'm four months

223
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,370
The legal department
is backing your story

224
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,176
about not being able
to fire a pregnant woman

225
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,049
no matter how much
she might deserve it.

226
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,610
So get back to work.

227
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,281
Thank you
so much, Jerry.

228
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,918
I really appreciate
it. Thank you.
From both of us.

229
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:44,002
Congratulations on
the baby. The entire
legal department is thrilled.

230
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,471
Hey, why didn't you
tell me earlier?
Oh, I know.

231
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,634
Probably because
there's so much that
can go horribly wrong.

232
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,941
I mean, I'm out
of the woods. But I
do everything right.
[laughs]

233
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,278
Anyway, so I'm having
my baby first, not that
it's a competition.

234
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,112
But I win! [laughs]

235
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,052
Anyway, no, really,
congratulations.

236
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,090
Oh, Thea!
Oh, I'm so
excited for you.

237
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,648
No wonder you've
been spacey lately.
[chuckles]

238
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,989
(Garth)
What's going on?

239
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,961
(Ann)
Everybody, Thea's pregnant!

240
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,930
Don't look at me.
I never touched her.

241
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,796
(Garth)
Never would have guessed.
You still look sexy.

242
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,632
I had to tell everyone.
Couldn't keep it a secret.

243
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,935
Of course. How can you
hide that kind of thing?

244
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,773
(Carl)
I should've known. My
left knee's been hurting.
When my knee hurts,

245
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,813
it usually means
someone's pregnant.

246
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,782
Y eah, or they're
stuck underwater in a car.
Anyway, I'm glad it's this.

247
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,411
(Garth)
So who's
the very lucky fella?

248
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,921
(Lisa)
You didn't tell 'em
the rest of the news?

249
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,752
Thea and Miles
are engaged!

250
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,520
[all] Oh!

251
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,154
(Kristen)
That's so great!

252
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,724
I mean, I got married
before I got pregnant,
but better late than never.

253
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,291
Whoo-hoo!
Yay for you!

254
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,530
Yeah, I'm, I'm really
excited, everyone.

255
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,972
Yeah, thrilled.
Over the moon.
Way over it!

256
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,668
[all chuckle]

257
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,835
[silence]

258
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,105
Psst.
[chuckles]

259
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,946
(Lisa)
Pregnant? It's brilliant.

260
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,647
Where did you
come up with that?

261
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,418
I saw it on an episode
of Law and Order.

262
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,482
Yeah. You can't fire
a pregnant woman.

263
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,154
Discrimination, lawsuits,
bad mojo, whatever.

264
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,629
Smart.

265
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,325
By the way,
thanks for your help.

266
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,925
Pregnant wasn't bad enough.
I had to get engaged.

267
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,598
Well, I didn't want
people to think you were
some kind of wayward skank.

268
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,732
Is that what you
think of single mothers?

269
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,370
No, of course not.
I just happen to know that
a lot of people in the office

270
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,903
think you're a wayward
skank and I thought this
could turn it around.

271
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,679
[sigh]
Thanks. Crap, Lisa.
What am I gonna do?
How will I get out of this?

272
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,154
Can't we just
say that you know,
something happened to,

273
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,057
I don't know, one
of your tubes. Sprung a leak.

274
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,095
Do you know what
you're talking about?

275
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,426
Let's just go along with
it for a little while

276
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,432
and then we'll say
it was a false alarm.

277
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,992
You thought you were
pregnant, but it turns out
you just had crabs.

278
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,230
Ew.

279
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,210
(Thea)
I'm so sorry, Em. I had
a crazy day at work

280
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,079
and I lost track of time.
Am I too late?

281
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,019
The meeting was at four
and it's five o'clock now.
You do the math.

282
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,988
I'm really sorry.

283
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,321
Have you been drinking?

284
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,258
I had a cocktail.

285
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,227
Come on. You're 17.
You should be out
drinking and smoking

286
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,305
(Thea)
I'll reschedule
with your guidance
counselor next week.

287
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,971
Don't bother. I already met
with Miss Talbot and we
discussed my options

288
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,173
What options?

289
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,650
She suggested I start
taking some cooking
classes after school.

290
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,313
You have
tennis after school.

291
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,686
Yeah, but I'm
sick of tennis.

292
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:56,194
I was thinking maybe I could
go to the Culinary Institute
in San Francisco.

293
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,856
No way. You're
staying right here
and going to UCLA.

294
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,924
Tennis will cover the tuition
and I'm busting my ass
off to cover the rest.

295
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,995
I know. You keep telling me
when Mom and Dad died,
we lost out on options.

296
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:11,168
(Thea)
Just do me a favor, be
a grown-up and accept the
hand that you've been dealt.

297
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,710
So that's
what you do?

298
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,609
Yeah, that's
what I do.

299
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,014
Really? 'Cause you were
at a bar instead of my
parent teacher conference.

300
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,891
Oh, hello, Mr. Abbott.

301
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,658
Jerry? Jerry,
where are you?

302
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,130
Mr. Abbott,
can I help you?

303
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,599
Is there anything
to drink in this place

304
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,069
or do I have to go
to my car and get
my divining rod?

305
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,867
I could get you
some water.

306
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,307
Go ahead, soldier.
Three parts scotch,
one part water.

307
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,310
Okay. Move, move,
move. Hey, soldier.

308
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,936
What brings
you to the office?

309
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,107
How are you? [chuckles]
Well, your brother
wants my book.

310
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,209
Jerry's at lunch.
But Thea can take
your manuscript for you

311
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,810
Who's Thea?

312
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,322
Jerry's secretary.
You talk to her
every day.

313
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,486
Congratulations are probably
in order. Thea has good news.
She's having a baby

314
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,823
Hm.

315
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,330
She looks like
she's strong stock.

316
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:11,301
Maybe she can
give us a strong
future Marine.

317
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,133
(Greg)
Thea, do you
have a minute?

318
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,695
So, uh, how are you?

319
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,764
Fine, thanks. You?

320
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:21,836
Oh, I'm fine. But I'm not
the one with a magical bundle
of joy growing inside of me.

321
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,906
So, no morning sickness?
No bloating?

322
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,782
No. Nuh-unh. Guess
I'm just really lucky.

323
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,548
A little too lucky,
if you ask me.

324
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,713
Yeah.

325
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,189
And uh, where
is your ring?

326
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,590
Well, we...

327
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,221
Her fianceé is saving
up for her ring.

328
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,891
It's not very
nice to try to
embarrass people.

329
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,629
So why don't you get back
to lying about yourself
on your dating websites?

330
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,576
Don't worry about him.
He doesn't know anything.
He's an idiot.

331
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,577
And I'm sure Greg
is still a virgin.

332
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,314
(woman)
Come on, Jerry.

333
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,873
Oh! Alright, Jerry.

334
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,179
(Umpire)
Oh! Watch it!

335
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,378
Dumbass.

336
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,580
(woman)
Come on, Nick.

337
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,486
(woman)
Come on Nick,
you can do it.

338
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,615
[MacArthur whines]

339
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,820
[all cheer Nick]

340
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,358
(Umpire)
Hit it!

341
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,628
Ow!

342
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,693
(Umpire)
Ball. Take your base.

343
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,068
(woman)
Take your base!

344
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,334
(woman)
Come on, Thea.

345
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,466
(man)
Come on, Thea!

346
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,839
(man)
Let's go, Thea!

347
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,968
[hit]

348
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,569
(man)
Go, go. Home run.

349
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,977
Come on, come on.

350
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,107
Go, go.
Get home, get home.

351
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,746
(man)
Come on, come on.

352
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,481
[all continue cheering]

353
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,886
Safe!

354
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,651
[all cheer]

355
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,617
Are you okay?

356
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,853
Y eah. I'm great.

357
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,359
(man)
Come on, Colonel.
You can do it.

358
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,559
(woman)
You got it!

359
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,623
Great.

360
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,759
(Jerry)
Thea.

361
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,703
Kristen. Come
here, please now.

362
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,833
(Jerry)
You shouldn't be playing
in your condition.

363
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,036
What condition?

364
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,703
Your baby.

365
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,747
(Garth)
Lisa, get your
ass out on base?

366
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,009
Of course.

367
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,176
We are taking you
out. For the season.

368
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,377
[sighs]

369
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,853
All season.

370
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,258
(woman)
Come on!

371
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,759
Hey, thanks
for the RBI.

372
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,887
Yeah, well,
no more RBIs.

373
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,592
Jerry says I'm
a liability, so I can't
play 'cause I'm pregnant.

374
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,659
Sounds like the most
reasonable opinion
he's had in years.

375
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,501
[all]
Oh!

376
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,598
[all cheer]

377
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,204
Yes!

378
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,642
[dog barks]

379
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,521
[dog whines]

380
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,820
[all gasp]

381
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,360
MacArthur?

382
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,861
(Ann)
Good heavens.

383
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,057
Oh, it's okay. I'm
coming for you, baby.

384
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,293
[dog barks and whines]

385
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,340
I need a copy
of Abbott's manuscript.

386
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,345
I'm gonna read
it in the car on
the way to his funeral.

387
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,280
What? You've never
seen a manuscript
on napkins before?

388
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,148
When genius
strikes, you write
it down. Do it now.

389
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,447
Okay.

390
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,685
Oh. Thea, um,
should you still
be using the copier?

391
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,560
Copy machines emit
electro magnetic waves.

392
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,327
And what does that do?

393
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,699
Well, no one knows yet.
But I've been reading
on the message boards

394
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,866
and it seems like something
you should avoid if you're
trying to have a well pregnancy.

395
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,465
I think I should be okay.

396
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:41,138
Oh, good. Well, if it
doesn't bother you,

397
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,408
then can you make 50
copies of that for me?

398
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,143
(Kristen)
Thank you.

399
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,281
You know, I,
I find it fascinating

400
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,879
that Kristen is only
a month further along
than you

401
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,688
and yet she's the size
of a school bus and you're
still the size of Kate Moss.

402
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,252
Different strokes,
I guess.

403
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,426
Perhaps it's easier
to feel the bump
than to see it.

404
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,959
What's the big deal?
Everyone likes to touch
a pregnant stomach.

405
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,233
Because you're
a gross weirdo, Greg.

406
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,011
And the baby
doesn't like
gross weirdos, Greg.

407
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,746
Hmpf.

408
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,941
You and me are going
shopping after work.

409
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,062
What on earth
are you doing?

410
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,495
I'm stealing
you a belly.

411
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,623
What?

412
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,167
You're four
months pregnant

413
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,635
and you've
got the abs of a
Jenku swimsuit model.

414
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,228
Sh. Cover me. Okay?

415
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,001
Look. If you
want people to
think you're pregnant,

416
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,205
you've gotta start
talking the talk and
walking the... waddle

417
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,171
I don't know
if I can do this.

418
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,377
You can do this.
Just do it for a week.

419
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,149
But you've gotta look
the part or people are
gonna get suspicious.

420
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,656
I look ridiculous.

421
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,989
These jeans
are elastic on the top.

422
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,358
I feel like I'm wearing
a condom on my stomach.

423
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,297
[chuckles]
You don't look
like you've been
anywhere near a condom.

424
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:13,066
(Lisa)
Gross. Did you know that
when women are in labor
they sometimes poop?

425
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,628
Ew.

426
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,472
Have you ever heard
of an episiotomy?
Or cankles? Hmm?

427
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,771
Agh.

428
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,837
Well, we should get
this as a reference.

429
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,883
I thought this whole
thing was gonna blow
over in a few days.

430
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,580
Yeah, but until then
you should know the ins and
outs of being preggers.

431
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,681
There's a whole world
of stuff here you know
nothing about.

432
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,522
Yeah. And I'd
kind of like to
keep it that way.

433
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,994
Ew. Look
at those nipples.

434
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,530
Wait a second,
wait a second.

435
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,622
What?

436
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,030
Here. here.

437
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,193
No. Can I keep
the stomach at your house?

438
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,533
No. That's like keeping
your arm at my house.

439
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,768
No, no. I don't want
Emma to find out and
she hates when I lie.

440
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,865
You lie all the time.

441
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,136
No, really.

442
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,576
It stays with you.
It's your stomach.

443
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,319
[knocking]

444
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,949
Hey! Can I get
a little privacy?

445
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,654
Whoa, what are
you doing in there?
Can I just come in?

446
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,321
I'm trying
to talk to you.

447
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,366
It doesn't matter
what I'm doing right
now, I am busy. Shoo.

448
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,701
Morning, Thea,
you got my check?

449
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,401
Wow. Look at you.

450
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,468
Yeah, look at me.
Oh, it's not what, um--.

451
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,481
Oh, geez, I mean.
You've obviously got
a lot on your plate.

452
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,780
I'm sorry about the other
day. Don't worry about
the rent check.

453
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,820
Take another
week or two.

454
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,514
You just take
care of yourself.

455
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,921
[Donna]
Oh, my God.

456
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,085
Oh, how
exciting. [gasps]

457
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,129
I have so much baby
stuff I can lend you.

458
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,722
Let me know
if you need to borrow
my old breast pump.

459
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,959
I just have
to rinse it.

460
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,696
[cheerful music]

461
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,289
(Garth)
My favorite lubricant,
Ann? WD-40.

462
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,258
(Ann)
Thea. I've made some
brownies for you
to fatten you up.

463
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,351
Oh, thank you.

464
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,656
It popped.

465
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,720
Y eah, once you pop,
you can't stop.

466
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,699
[chuckles]
You're carrying low.
It's definitely a boy.

467
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,499
Whatever it is,
you've obviously begun that
slippery slide into obesity.

468
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,438
Well, you had
a nice run there,
didn't you, champ?

469
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,033
Oh, good morning.

470
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,101
Look at you.

471
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,773
Oh, my God. I think
I just felt it kick.

472
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh. Yeah, mark it in
the baby journal
for me, will you?

473
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,078
I will.

474
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,450
Are people buying it?

475
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,012
Totally. Totally.
Ann made me brownies.

476
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,081
I got a seat
on the bus today.

477
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,252
And Garth is not
attracted to me anymore.

478
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,318
It's the best morning
I've had in years.

479
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,058
Okay, you want to hear
something even more amazing?

480
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,259
Have you read Abbott's
new manuscript?

481
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,097
I get asked
to Xerox, not to read.

482
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,162
Okay. Get ready
to have your mind blown.

483
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,697
Ah, "Philip of Macedon
had a hard-on."

484
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,438
"Scaled great peaks
to conquer the Greeks."

485
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,980
It's all rhyming couplets
and dirty limericks.

486
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,346
And this is what Jerry's
betting the bank on.

487
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,785
It's insane.

488
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,047
Oh, you're welcome.

489
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,621
Well, you
look different.

490
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,560
Sorry. I'll move
you to the shitty
corner in a second.

491
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,655
It's all
right, dear. You've
got your hands full.

492
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,927
You've exploded.

493
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,059
Well, yes, she has.

494
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,099
[clears throat]

495
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,733
Well, people.
I'm sure you'll
be relieved to hear

496
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,404
that MacArthur is expected
to make a full recovery.

497
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,141
I've gotten her a spot

498
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,616
at the McElroy
Center for Veterinary
Rehabilitation in Bethesda.

499
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,516
It's the best in the country.

500
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,250
They tell me she
should be at 90 percent
tail-wagging capability

501
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,586
after just six weeks.

502
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,649
I'll be out of
the office for a while.

503
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,252
I'll be working
out of the rehab
center in Bethesda

504
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,458
where I've taken
a room for the duration
of MacArthur's stay.

505
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,991
Until I get
back, Nicky will be
holding down the fort.

506
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,198
I'm giving him
strict instructions not
to do anything stupid.

507
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,002
(Garth)
Code red.

508
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,339
[sighs]
Seriously, Nick.

509
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,275
Don't blow it.

510
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,040
Check it out.

511
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,210
There's our fearless
leader plotting our
brilliant future.

512
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,585
(Thea)
Well at least
with him in charge,
I'm off the hook.

513
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,851
Well, things
are looking up.

514
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,519
Okay, let's figure
out how to get me
out of this mess.

515
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,223
I'll Google what
kind of mishaps can
happen when you're pregnant.

516
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,289
Hi, guys. Sorry
to bother you.

517
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,803
(Lisa)
You're boss now, Nick.
You can bother us
anytime you want.

518
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,570
Right. Um, Thea,
I kind of need a favor.
Would you, come with me?

519
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,139
We're meeting
Suzie Cavendish.

520
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,546
I mentioned her in
the meeting last week.

521
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,642
You see, Suzie's written
this hilarious book

522
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,086
about pregnancy.
It, it's true stories
about pregnant women

523
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,149
getting stuck in bathtubs
and throwing up under
their desks at work

524
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,991
and farting
by mistake in meetings.

525
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,624
It, it's stuff you,
you must know a lot more
about than me, obviously.

526
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,759
Yeah, totally. Totally.

527
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,168
I'm trying
really, really hard
not to fart right now.

528
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,572
Anyway, I want
to publish Suzie's book

529
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,577
and, and while Jerry's
gone, I'm gonna do it.

530
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,909
You know, carpe diem
and all that stuff.

531
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,676
Yeah, definitely.

532
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,708
I actually used to
be a pretty carpe diem
kind of person myself.

533
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,981
But not anymore.

534
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,283
Because I'm pregnant.

535
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,085
See, that's just it.

536
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,093
Suzie's not convinced
that Steinwald's
the right place.

537
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,460
So I thought
you might help
convince her otherwise.

538
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,123
Yeah, sure.

539
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,532
I mean, I'll just
talk to her about
the whole farting thing.

540
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,971
Uh, one thing.
Uh, Suzie kind of
thinks you're an editor.

541
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,599
Why would
she think that?

542
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,200
I kind of implied it.

543
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,302
What?

544
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,403
Suzie!

545
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,948
(Suzie)
Hi. Nice to see you.

546
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,952
(Suzie)
Most pregnancy books make
you feel totally inadequate

547
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,545
and how you're
destined to be
a failure as a parent.

548
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,183
No one writes
about what pregnancy
is really like,

549
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,726
how you feel
fat and clumsy
and stupid.

550
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,694
The absolute worst

551
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,460
is "What to Expect
When You're Expecting."
Have you read that?

552
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:20,163
Oh, no, I was
told it was so bad I
shouldn't even go near it.

553
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,035
So, what are you reading?

554
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,598
Uh,

555
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,645
You know, just
the usual suspects.

556
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,202
Like?

557
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,546
Well, I was
banking on finding
Pregnancy for Dummies.

558
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,178
I love
that series. Yeah.

559
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,518
Hm. Interesting.

560
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,785
Come on, Nicky,
how can you guys
sell my book

561
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,225
if you're not familiar
with the competition?

562
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,694
Thea has had a pretty
full workload lately.

563
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,564
I don't know, guys.
I don't know if this
is the right marriage.

564
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,967
Come on. From
the people who brought
you the Kalashnikov diaries

565
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,530
comes a comedic send-up
of 21 st century pregnancy?

566
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,543
It's just, the right
home is so important.

567
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,203
I know. We are
the right home.

568
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,409
I mean, sure,
our, uh, plumbing
is a little leaky

569
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,883
and maybe we need
a new paint job.

570
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:12,048
But our backyard is a really
great place for a barbecue
in the summer.

571
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,490
You know?

572
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,293
If we can make a bestseller
out of the " Defeat of Darius
at Issus" we've gotta be good.

573
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,299
I mean, that couldn't
be easy, right?

574
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,096
Absolutely.

575
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,831
The thing about
pregnancy is it's
incredibly messy.

576
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,806
Those other books
are teaching you how
to avoid the mess.

577
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,307
You're embracing the mess.

578
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,402
And you've written
an incredible insightful,

579
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:38,472
hilarious,
controversial manifesto.

580
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,485
Just give us a shot.
It has bestseller
written all over it.

581
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,418
We promise we
won't let you down.

582
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:46,983
So you've read it.

583
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,322
Oh. I live it.
Love it. Every day.

584
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,925
Let me think about it.

585
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,489
Hey, I'm starting a new
birthing class tomorrow.

586
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,126
Maybe Thea could
come with me.

587
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,500
She'll be there.

588
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,232
And bring your partner.

589
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,469
Her fiancee. Miles, right?

590
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,568
Yeah. Could you excuse
me for a second?

591
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,839
(Nick)
Yes.

592
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,715
Vodka. Straight up.

593
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,089
[gasps] Thanks.

594
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,863
You okay?

595
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,271
I just set the world
record for bullshitting.

596
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,866
What happened?

597
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,434
Long story.
I can't handle
doing it again.

598
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,173
A promotion?

599
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,547
You are the new
Associate Editor

600
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,381
of our brand
new Family division.

601
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,114
Family division?

602
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,055
Suzie called.
She wants to give us
a shot, thanks to you.

603
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,524
Now, Suzie's book will
launch our new division.

604
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,494
It's a perfect opportunity
to capture a new demographic

605
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,758
and help the company
to grow vertically...

606
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,390
Nick.

607
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,163
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

608
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,703
This whole thing
is a big lie.

609
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,069
I feel terrible,
but I'm not really...

610
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,869
An editor?

611
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,308
I know, I'm the one
who forced you to lie.

612
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,747
which as a rule isn't great
but what's not a lie is that
you did really good today.

613
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,841
There's so many
people more qualified.

614
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,910
So many people in ways
you don't even know.

615
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:27,390
Thea. T o be a good
editor all you need is a,
a feel for the material

616
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,052
It's what my father had
when he started this company

617
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,959
and it's
what you have.

618
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,488
You're living
through the thrills
of starting a family.

619
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,899
What about Kristen?
She's pregnant.

620
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,268
Obviously I am too,
but she's, she's
really pregnant.

621
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,776
First of all, Kristen's a
lawyer without a creative
bone in her body.

622
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:50,440
And then there's
the indisputable fact that
she's a complete weirdo.

623
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,576
[sighs]
Oh. Look, Nick,
I mean, I see your point.

624
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,847
I do. And I wanna help.

625
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,856
But I just, I can't.

626
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,949
I'm not your accountant.

627
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,324
But the other thing
you should know is that

628
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:08,161
associate editors
make a lot more money
than secretaries.

629
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,325
A lot?

630
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,027
Let's just say,

631
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,297
you'll have your own
secretary and office.

632
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,306
So are you my new
associate editor?

633
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,899
[gasps and music]
I guess I am.

634
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,208
"War Stories From
the Pregnancy Front"
by Suzie Cavendish.

635
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,252
You loved it,
you live it.

636
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,911
You should
probably read it.

637
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,650
I do, I agree with
what you're saying.

638
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,522
If you have your
colon health you
do have everything.

639
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,427
But, I do, I thought
it interesting when you
said we were going wrong

640
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:45,231
and we should be sort of
on the seat like a gargoyle
as opposed to just sitting.

641
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,295
Not now, Miles.

642
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,275
Don't you know
enough about being
fake pregnant already?

643
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,835
How can this be this
big of a deal?

644
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,577
I mean, come on,
you do the nasty,
you're knocked up,

645
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,553
you inflate and then, uh,
eight, nine months?
Nine months later

646
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:07,785
you shoot that puppy out.
I mean, how can there be
8 million books about this?

647
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,952
Just promise me
you won't write one.

648
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,429
Okay. If you promise
you're still on
birth control.

649
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,295
Believe me, I am.

650
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,560
Oh, yeah?

651
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,658
Uh-huh.

652
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,827
Excellent.

653
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,269
[rhythmic music]

654
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,625
Nice new digs, huh?

655
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,754
Yeah.

656
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,297
So, what did you think?

657
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,559
About what?

658
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,464
Uh, Suzie's book.
Any thoughts?

659
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,799
Oh, yeah, it was great.

660
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,703
What do you think?

661
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,402
How much did
you actually read?

662
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,809
The first two chapters.

663
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:05,508
But I'm gonna finish
the rest of it today. I
just got a little distracted.

664
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,278
Nick, please,
let me explain.

665
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,411
Thanks for your thoughts.

666
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,481
[gasps] You have
shelves. And a door.

667
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,527
[thud]

668
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,188
Congratulations, Thea.

669
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,288
Thank you, Greg.

670
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,801
You really think you can
get to the top by playing
games, don't ya?

671
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:31,171
I know what you're
up to, Thea. And l
think that it stinks.

672
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,710
Hm.

673
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,578
Really? Do you think that it
stinks that I want to hire
you to be my Assistant?

674
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,582
[gasps] Really?

675
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,017
You'll start first
thing Monday after
I put the paperwork through.

676
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,784
Oh, wow, Thea. Thea,
thank you so much. I, I
could kiss you right now.

677
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,291
You don't have
to do that.

678
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,690
I'll see you later, boss.

679
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,752
Look at you,
Little Miss Executive.

680
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,525
Hardly. I don't
even really know
what I'm doing here.

681
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,159
I didn't finish
the manuscript
last night and Nick

682
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,601
just asked for my opinion
and I didn't have one.

683
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,768
You might wanna get one.
This is your ticket out
of the secretarial pool.

684
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,138
[rhythmic music]

685
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,050
(Garth)
If your last name
is O'Keeffe, why do
you look Jewish?

686
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:27,120
Well, it's true.
You don't look lrish.

687
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,395
[louder music]

688
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,647
Steinwald Publishing.

689
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,917
So O' Keeffe got
a new girlfriend.
He's robbing the cradle.

690
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,587
She's 95.

691
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,925
Did you hear me?

692
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,297
(Thea)
I loved it. It
was funny and smart

693
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,842
and you don't even
have to be pregnant
to enjoy it.

694
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,310
I'm guessing
about that because
I am pregnant.

695
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,244
I enjoyed it and I'm
not pregnant.

696
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,716
I was thinking, you could
organize the chapters
like a pregnancy.

697
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,515
You know,
group each woman's
stories by trimester.

698
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,989
So, so the book would
start with stories about
the awkward moments

699
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,050
when everyone thinks
you've been eating
too many cupcakes.

700
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,187
Exactly. And then
the second trimester.

701
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,596
Like Sally's story
when she threw up in
her purse at her kid's play.

702
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,397
Nick, I'm sorry I didn't
finish the book last night.
It won't happen again.

703
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,233
I'm glad you like it.

704
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,604
We've got our work
cut out for us. It'll be
in bookstores in 6 weeks.

705
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:50,011
I'd like to see your notes,
but Suzie's class starts in
20 minutes so you should go.

706
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:55,383
I totally forgot.
The thing is, Miles is, is
going out of town for work.

707
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,545
That's too bad.

708
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,248
Do you think
I could reschedule?

709
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,923
Now it's time for partner
relaxation techniques

710
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,052
for when your
special marathon begins.

711
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,530
So, partners, I want
you to move behind
your marathoners

712
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,658
with your legs
open in a big V.

713
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,363
Hm. Welcome home.

714
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:18,136
Now, take this
opportunity to stroke
your wives or girlfriends.

715
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,268
Stroke it out.

716
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,541
Now why don't you
whisper something
special to her, okay?

717
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,845
Something that only
you two would share
in this private moment.

718
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,786
It could be funny,
It could be naughty.
[chuckles]

719
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,050
I'm not listening.

720
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,422
Let that relaxation
wash over you.

721
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,017
I am so sorry
about this.

722
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,528
It's, you know,
you don't have
to stroke my hair.

723
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,258
Okay, I'm sorry.

724
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,459
Uh, you know, you can
lean back if you want.

725
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,502
I, I can tell you're
kind of straining.

726
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,696
I am.

727
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,137
Great. Now that
we're all relaxed,

728
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,767
let's try some
birthing positions, okay?

729
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:55,073
Mary? Could I borrow
your partner for just a sec?

730
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,546
I promise I'll give
him back. [chuckles] Maybe.

731
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,981
I'm just kidding. Come
here, cutie. All right.

732
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,750
I want you to get on
all fours with your palms
firmly placed to the ground

733
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:09,282
and then we're gonna
rock back. We're gonna
rock back into it. Oh.

734
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,658
Feel that womb open up.

735
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,290
It feels familiar,
right? This is how we got
ourselves into this mess.

736
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:19,496
[chuckles]
For some of us, not all
of us. The position's
not for everybody.

737
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,507
Partners, I want
you to envelope
your marathoner, okay?

738
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,908
And just get in a
deep stretch here
around the belly

739
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,245
keep moving back and forth,
right? Get your hands on
the tummy back there.

740
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,342
And keep pushing
in. Keep pushing
in and envelope.

741
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,944
Get right on top of there.
Feel that, feel... Oop.

742
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,353
Man down, okay.

743
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,685
It's okay.

744
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,625
J ust hop back on.
No mistakes here.

745
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:49,496
Okay. All right. Finish
up when you feel done.
I need a few more.

746
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,967
If you'll indulge
me Mary, thank you.

747
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,437
Okay, and just
keep the rocking.
Never stop rocking.

748
00:37:55,506 --> 00:38:00,967
Oh! Y es.
Give it to me, Rob,
we're doing it now.

749
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,913
Oh! Oh!

750
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,315
Okay. [sighs]
And we're done.

751
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,287
Wonderful, thank you.
This guy's good, right?

752
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,949
I'm gonna borrow
you for another class.

753
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,552
Or after class.
[chuckles] I'm kidding.

754
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,727
(Suzie)
Bye, guys.

755
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,826
(Nick)
That was great.
Thanks a lot.

756
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,097
(Thea)
Bye.

757
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,071
(Nick)
Wow.
That was up there

758
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,576
as one of
the most embarrassing
moments of my life.

759
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,441
Hey, here, let me
get you something.

760
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,641
No, no, it's the least
I can do after nearly
paralyzing you.

761
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,082
Hi.

762
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,211
Hi.

763
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,324
Thanks.

764
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,917
(Thea)
Did you always work
in the family business?

765
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:56,433
Uh, I wanted to be a
writer. But I was scared
I might be a total hack

766
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,661
so I got
an accounting degree.
[chuckles]

767
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,035
I figured I'd make
a living doing that
while I finished my book...

768
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,666
but kind of been
stuck in the middle
for a few years.

769
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,573
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

770
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,477
Well, in college
I played in a badass
metal band.

771
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,606
Really?
You're a badass?

772
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,082
A little bit, kind of.

773
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,848
Fascinating. A little
terrifying but fascinating.

774
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:22,052
So is that what you did
in college, badass metal
band studies?

775
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,185
No, I didn't
finish college.

776
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,287
Oh, why not?
Too boring? Not
Joan Jett enough for you?

777
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:32,803
No. Um, I loved college.
It's just my parents passed
away in a car accident,

778
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,169
so I had to leave
to take care of my
little sister.

779
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,470
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't
have said anything.

780
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,409
Oh, n-no. I, I'm
glad you told me.

781
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,277
I'm just so sorry
that happened.

782
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,781
Thanks.

783
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,683
So is your sister
a badass like you?

784
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,847
No, she's more
of a smart ass.

785
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,516
[laughs] Here.

786
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,921
Hey, you know, uh,
Suzie's having a pool
party this weekend.

787
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,726
You should come.
And bring Miles.

788
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,323
Pool party?

789
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,767
Yeah. I promise, I won't
be wearing a Speedo.

790
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,928
[chuckles]

791
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,706
[door opens]

792
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,275
Nice look!

793
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,186
Do we have a secret steam
room you never told me about?

794
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,723
No, I'm going
to a pool party.

795
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,259
Ah. Well, good thing
you've got that towel on now.

796
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,352
Wouldn't wanna
leave that 'til when
you actually get there.

797
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,365
Enough of the sass,
smarty pants. What
are you doing here?

798
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,094
Tennis ended early.

799
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,159
What's the bag for?

800
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,760
Nothing.

801
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,432
Come on, you can
do better than that.

802
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,031
At least I'm wearing pants.

803
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,872
Pants? You call
those pants?

804
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,071
They're shorts.

805
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,913
All right, bye. Don't
call if you need me.

806
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,181
[rock music]

807
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:01,281
Okay, you really
have to act like
you're the father, okay?

808
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,620
Yeah.

809
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,752
You're the father.
It's serious.

810
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,023
Oh, come on.

811
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,961
You have to appear
to be responsible.

812
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,000
Are you kidding me?
I'm totally psyched.

813
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,230
I thought about
this. Everyone's gonna
think I'm a super-stud

814
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,204
for knocking up a
hot chick like you.

815
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,264
Okay, so, that's an
example of something
you wouldn't say.

816
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,743
Baby. Well, I think
you're beautiful
even with your...

817
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,040
Thank you.

818
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,144
(Thea)
Hey.

819
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,689
How are you?

820
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,953
Nick, this is
my fiance, Miles.
Miles, this is Nick.

821
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,927
Congratulations.
You must be so excited.

822
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,693
Oh, it's, I just can't
wait for the little guy
to [pop] pop out.

823
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,960
Oh, you're
having a boy.

824
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,058
Yeah.

825
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,432
We, uh, we
just found out.

826
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,994
And do you
have a name yet?

827
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,699
Now, see,
I didn't think any...

828
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,865
Hey.

829
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,875
Garth, this is
my fiance, Miles.

830
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,468
Miles, Garth.
He's an editor
at the company.

831
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,945
You're a lucky guy, huh?

832
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:01,644
Yes, I am.
You look pretty
lucky yourself there.

833
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,153
I'm gonna go inside
and say hi to Suzie.

834
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,745
Oh, yeah,
hold up, babe.

835
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,257
I'm taking
a dip. It's
blazing here. Babes.

836
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,349
Yeah?

837
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,654
Right there.

838
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,195
Anybody care to join?

839
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,355
I will. Let's go in.

840
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,795
That's what
I like to hear.

841
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,389
I don't wanna
get my chain wet.

842
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,300
Listen, I have two
friends that I want
you to meet.

843
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,965
They're both writers
and they're actually
looking for a new publisher,

844
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,837
so I think they'll
really like you.

845
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,171
Really?

846
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,040
You and Nick
make such a good team.

847
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,340
Thank you.

848
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,112
Hey, guys.
I want you to
meet Audrey Gold

849
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,921
and Dr. Terry
Bournachle. Terry wrote
the Bournachle Baby Book,

850
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,859
which is the bible.

851
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,559
I won't even touch that.
I don't wanna be accused
of having a God complex.

852
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,363
And Audrey just
finished a book
on single parenting

853
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:56,770
and I hear from reliable
sources that she's not
very happy at Boyle Donner.

854
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,775
Oh, well we would love
to meet with you guys.

855
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,272
Yeah, Nick and Thea
just started a parenting
division at Steinwald.

856
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,715
Hmm. You have
the most unique shape.

857
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:12,222
If you don't mind me
asking, you don't have
a distended uterus, do you?

858
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:16,521
Uh, no, no, I,
I don't think so.

859
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,085
Well, who's your OB?

860
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,429
[clears throat]
Dr. Draken Barysinwitz.

861
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,628
You mean Hans?
Frogenberry Schoenewitz?

862
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,264
I thought he moved
back to Vienna.

863
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,534
[splash]

864
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,132
[all]
Oh!

865
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,770
My bad. I just,
I was trying to,
totally going for her.

866
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,279
Very funny, Miles.

867
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:41,250
Hey. You should,
uh, you should
totally come in.

868
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,252
We're having
such a good
time in there.

869
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,254
I don't feel like
swimming right now.

870
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,256
Come on. It's
so nice in there.

871
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:50,191
No one cares
that you're fat.
Kids, tell her to come in.

872
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,525
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.

873
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,394
(Thea)
It's okay.

874
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,696
You don't want to
disappoint the children.

875
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,792
Woo!

876
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,131
Shit.

877
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,637
[laughs]

878
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,100
What is that?

879
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,801
Oh!

880
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,104
[all] Oh!

881
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,269
[Miles laughs]

882
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,437
[gasps]

883
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,810
(Nick)
That's not cool.

884
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,922
(Thea)
It was so humiliating.

885
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,255
On the way home
I told him to drop me off
and never speak to me again.

886
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,660
Good. I always thought
Miles was a bit of a
numbnut anyway.

887
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,632
[sighs]
I'm just so embarrassed
that Nick thinks he's the
father of my child.

888
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,328
Who cares
what Nick thinks?

889
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,200
He's just the first
person in years

890
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,502
that thinks I'm
capable of doing more
than just pouring coffee.

891
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,804
What do you think he'll
say when he finds out

892
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:44,007
your baby is a piece
of polyurethane foam
we swiped off a mannequin?

893
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,879
He's actually kinda cute
though, don't you think?

894
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,212
Who?

895
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,980
Um, Nick.

896
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,817
Um, no.

897
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,379
Cigarette?

898
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,891
No, I probably shouldn't.

899
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,392
[guffaws]

900
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:03,030
Okay, uh, to recap, uh

901
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,399
only one of you
would even bother
to look at the book.

902
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,998
And the rest of you
wouldn't buy it with
a gun to your head...

903
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,543
which can't
be good for sales.

904
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:20,307
Can any of you
tell me why the cover
doesn't speak to you?

905
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,684
Maybe comparing
pregnancy to a battle
is, uh, putting you off.

906
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,120
Y es.

907
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,385
I can't stay
for the rest
of the focus group.

908
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,087
Can I still
get my check?

909
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,186
Just stop by reception.

910
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,897
Okay. Uh, one down.

911
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,605
Maybe we should
forget what's on
the cover for a second.

912
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,271
what makes this
book great is that
it's a collection

913
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:52,941
of real stories for real
women talking about how
it feels to be pregnant.

914
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,348
So let's talk about some
of us feel right now.

915
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,119
I feel like crap.

916
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,248
That's good. I mean,
that's bad. But keep going.

917
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:05,284
How come no one
talks about how
much pregnancy sucks!

918
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,523
Oh, there's no
glow in my house.

919
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,567
Okay, so what
I'm hearing is that
you're all so over it.

920
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,363
[all] Yeah.

921
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,166
Hello, I'm Orca the Whale.
Like, what's up with that?

922
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,332
I know, they're not
even bloated at all.

923
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,637
Thea, your
sister's at reception.

924
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,381
Hey, what are
you doing here?

925
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,250
You forgot to sign the
release for my trip to Lake
Arrowhead. It's due today.

926
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,188
Thea, aren't you
going to introduce
me to your sister?

927
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:37,227
Oh, Nick, Emma.
Emma, Nick.

928
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,159
She's in a real rush.
She has to go.

929
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:45,260
Okay, well, this has been
fun. It's been fun.

930
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,495
What is that?

931
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,367
Just because you
don't like my dress

932
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,065
doesn't mean you
have to be rude.

933
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,005
Move. I'll
tell you outside.

934
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,337
What's wrong with you?

935
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,469
I'm a big fat liar,
but Jerry was firing me

936
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,241
I had to come up
with something.

937
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,741
You are one sandwich shy
of a picnic, you know that?

938
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,014
You're crazy. What
are you thinking?

939
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,784
[sighs]
You might be interested
to know that I got a
promotion and a raise.

940
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,452
I can't believe we're
actually related.

941
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,324
As soon as I can
I'm gonna come clean.

942
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:15,422
Things are complicated.
The company depends on me.

943
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,663
I have heard enough.
I am out of here.

944
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,069
[soft cheerful music]

945
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,003
Morning, Thea.

946
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,637
Last month's
and this month's.

947
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,272
Wow, early.
That's a first.

948
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,212
I've got
something for you.

949
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,083
Oh, you made these?

950
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,417
Yes.

951
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,583
I went with marigold
because it's neutral.

952
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,320
Thank you.

953
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,625
Hey.

954
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,862
Hey. Okay, not that
you're interested,

955
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,927
but the word is
that Nick's divorce
is finalized this week.

956
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,199
Garth told me.

957
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,865
Garth told you?

958
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,535
I've been
hanging out
with him, Miss Busy.

959
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,876
I took the liberty
of picking you up a
calcium-enriched smoothie

960
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,348
and a bran muffin.
I figured you might be
getting a little backed up.

961
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,406
Thanks, Greg.

962
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,578
You're welcome.
Excuse me.

963
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,145
Greg's worried about
you being backed up?

964
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,021
Constipation is
a common problem
for pregnant women.

965
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,220
Ach.

966
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,890
Well, lucky
for you you're
not actually pregnant.

967
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,899
Or do you even
know that anymore?

968
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,798
Of course I know
that. Obviously.

969
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,200
[knocking]

970
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,898
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

971
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:32,408
wanted to get you
a little something.
I ordered it off of eBay.

972
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:37,179
It's an armadillo
foot for, for when
you're in labor.

973
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,477
It, it wards
off the evil eye.

974
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,949
Thank you so much, Carl.
That's so sweet of you.

975
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,510
I'll keep it with
me the whole time.

976
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,888
Oh-kay. I know I told
you to go along with
this for a few weeks,

977
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,927
but you're starting
to freak me out.

978
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,894
Things are going
really well for me.

979
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,932
It's not because
of the stomach.
You're doing good work.

980
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,490
The only thing
you're doing bad
is walking around

981
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,036
with a load of
bullshit strapped
to your stomach.

982
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,298
Nick. Nick.

983
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,600
[whispers]
Nick.

984
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,073
What's up?

985
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,303
You won't
believe who left
me a voicemail.

986
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,311
An Associate
producer from the Vista.

987
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,505
No way.

988
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,979
She read the book,
loves it,

989
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,074
with Claire's
approval, we'll be in.

990
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,142
That would be
the greatest thing ever.

991
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,016
Oh!

992
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,282
Oh.

993
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,792
Sorry. I, I'm a bit
of a closet hugger.

994
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,417
I, that won't
happen again.

995
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:25,984
That's, that's okay.

996
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,758
[intercom]
Nick, Jerry for you.

997
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,163
Oh. Uh, put
him through.

998
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,133
How you holding
down the fort, Nicky?

999
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,295
Good, Everything's
going great.

1000
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,929
Working on a little project.

1001
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,236
You haven't done
anything stupid, have you?

1002
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,639
No, of course not.

1003
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,645
You're doing
great, sweetie.

1004
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,305
[whimpers]

1005
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:48,613
Do me a favor, Nick.
No little projects.
Don't do anything.

1006
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:53,384
Don't touch anything.
If you need a project,
try Match. com.

1007
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,857
It's been awhile since
you've seen any action.

1008
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,417
Okay, Jerry. I'll talk
to you later. Thank you.

1009
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,824
It really hasn't
been that long.

1010
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,525
I'm, I'm sure.

1011
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,592
Um, okay. I got a lot
of work to do. So, I'm
gonna go do it.

1012
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,298
Okay. Bye.

1013
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,136
[vacuum cleaner]

1014
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,376
So the book comes
out in three weeks.

1015
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,074
That, that gives us
plenty of time for publicity.

1016
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,952
I hope you don't mind.

1017
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,458
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

1018
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,289
Oh, wow.

1019
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,696
I can see!

1020
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,530
[chuckles]

1021
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,366
God. I don't know
if you know this,
but you're pregnant.

1022
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,635
Your sense of humor
really takes a dive
after nine o'clock, huh?

1023
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,073
Is it after nine?

1024
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,508
Yeah.

1025
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,977
Oh, my God,
I'm slave-driving
a pregnant woman.

1026
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,674
Not at all,
I want to be here.

1027
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,717
I do, I feel I'm
making up for lost time.

1028
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,413
And I'm really
grateful you've
given me this shot.

1029
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,512
So, thanks.

1030
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,886
It's my pleasure.

1031
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,987
You should be at
home with your fiance.

1032
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,363
Right. My fiance.

1033
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,468
I'm taking you home.

1034
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,704
But, I promise to
have ridiculously
high expectations

1035
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:21,903
of you in the morning.

1036
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:22,967
[softly chuckles]

1037
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,479
Thank you.

1038
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,778
Well, here, no, no.

1039
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,215
Okay.

1040
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,753
[cheerful music]

1041
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:38,386
[velcro sound]

1042
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,290
Is this your first?

1043
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,892
Yeah. I can't wait.
And you?

1044
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,096
It's mine, too.

1045
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,897
Would you
sign this, please?

1046
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,605
(Nick)
Oh, that's amazing.

1047
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:36,243
What about
Thea? Thea?

1048
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,911
Absolutely, you.

1049
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,046
No, no, no.

1050
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,146
Yes.

1051
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,383
Yes.

1052
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,153
No, I stay
behind the camera.

1053
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,091
You, over here
right now.

1054
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,027
(Nick)
Come on, give it a shot.

1055
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,424
Oh, yeah.

1056
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,592
Work it.

1057
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,760
Nick.

1058
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,633
Make love
to the...

1059
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,434
Sorry. I know
you don't actually
say that. I'm sorry.

1060
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,838
Thanks for coming here
with me. I had
such a craving.

1061
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,905
Are you kidding me?
I love mud slide pie.

1062
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,382
I think we could
use a little more
whipped cream.

1063
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,476
Oh, did I tell you we
signed Bournachle?

1064
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,249
Thanks for hooking
us up with him.

1065
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,984
My pleasure. Oh, I may
have some good news.

1066
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:18,323
I may have gotten us two
spots in Sunshine Daycare.

1067
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,523
Great. Thanks. I haven't
even thought about daycare.

1068
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:24,362
I don't know how you
do it, with your kid,
your pregnancy

1069
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,494
and your job. I can't
even take care of my
little sister, Emma.

1070
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,732
I wish my mother left
me user instructions.

1071
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,172
Well, there are no
hard and fast rules.

1072
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,971
You just have to go
with your gut.

1073
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,207
Yeah, well I certainly
have no shortage of
gut at the moment.

1074
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,841
Well, when all else
fails, sugar and shopping.

1075
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,908
Very persuasive.

1076
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,622
[doorbell]

1077
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,724
Hi.

1078
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,393
Hi. Is Emma here?

1079
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,233
Hi, Emma. Can you
babysit tomorrow night?

1080
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,239
Oh, I can't,
Donna. Sorry.

1081
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,639
I have to study
with my friend Chloe.

1082
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,611
Um, I can do it.

1083
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,374
You know, good practice.

1084
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,747
That's right. Oh, God.
Thea, you are the best.

1085
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,285
T omorrow night at eight?

1086
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,547
Yes.

1087
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,747
Great. Bye.

1088
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,656
I don't even know who you
are right now, but you're
definitely not the best.

1089
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,688
Do you wanna make cupcakes
and then maybe go shopping
at Forever Twenty-One?

1090
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:34,635
No. Actually I'd rather
scrub myself down with
a pineapple

1091
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,433
than do that.

1092
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,810
(Kristen)
I don't know what to do.

1093
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:46,611
this was Dan's idea. He
was all, like, let's have
a baby. It'll be so cute.

1094
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,981
You know? I was,
like really?

1095
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:53,045
Really? Well, let's strap
50 pounds of cement
to your torso

1096
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,559
and see how fun it is then.
You know, I just--
[sobs]

1097
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,720
Yeah. I know.
I understand.

1098
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,594
I just need a drink.
Or some weed.

1099
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,327
I know it's scary.

1100
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:08,633
I mean, the fact that
we're gonna have these
tiny fragile humans

1101
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:12,038
totally dependent
on us. It's kind of
freaking me out, too

1102
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,370
Really?

1103
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,740
Yeah.

1104
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,143
'Cause, Thea, you just,
you seem so together.

1105
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,680
Oh, hi.

1106
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,147
We need to talk.

1107
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,911
What happened?

1108
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,850
Okay, thanks
for listening.

1109
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,249
Uh,

1110
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,295
I uh,

1111
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,660
I kind of got into
an altercation with Miles.

1112
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,198
What are you talking about?

1113
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,860
He was kissing
another woman.
So I confronted him.

1114
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,098
And he told me
he's not the father.

1115
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,571
So I punched him.

1116
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,766
You what?

1117
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,174
I punched him.
I couldn't help it.

1118
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,838
You deserve better than
that, Thea, a, a lot better.

1119
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,145
Nick, Miles
is not the father.

1120
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,014
He's not even
my boyfriend anymore.

1121
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,350
The truth is,
there is no father.

1122
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:02,221
I mean, there is but it was
a one-night stand and he's
out of the picture now.

1123
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:07,320
Thea, there is nothing
wrong with being
a single mother.

1124
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,557
Okay.

1125
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,258
[knocking]

1126
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,962
[clears throat]
The printer
has a question
He's on line one.

1127
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,834
Okay.

1128
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,798
Oh.

1129
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,070
What was that about?
He looks like a maniac.

1130
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,611
I just told
Nick the truth.

1131
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,408
[gasps]
How'd he take it?

1132
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,245
Okay. He doesn't
think I should be
with Miles anyway.

1133
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,649
Yeah, but what did he
say about the pregnancy?

1134
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,017
He didn't say anything
about the pregnancy.

1135
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,680
What's there to say?

1136
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,851
Thea. We should talk.
Do you want to get
a beer after work?

1137
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,861
A beer? You know
I can't drink.

1138
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,000
[rhythmic music]

1139
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,036
Is your stomach growing?

1140
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,037
Well, I'm nearly
six months now.

1141
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,640
(Thea)
Hi, how are you?

1142
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,840
Where's my
sister, Emma?

1143
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,277
(Emma coming in)
Hey.

1144
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,184
How was practice?

1145
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,086
Fine. Same as usual.

1146
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:11,924
Really? That's funny
because Coach Henretti
told me you quit a month ago.

1147
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:15,897
I found this
in your backpack. You've
got some explaining to do.

1148
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,490
That's dried cilantro.

1149
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,626
Yeah, right.

1150
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,294
Smell it.

1151
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,404
Okay, maybe it is. But
where were you today?

1152
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:29,343
At Jake's,
waiting tables.

1153
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,710
You've been
lying for weeks.

1154
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,271
Hey, I learn
from the best.

1155
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:43,315
Hey, um, your
boss is here.

1156
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,758
What?

1157
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,126
Maybe he wants
to make cupcakes with you.

1158
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,324
Um, can you get my
stomach? It's in my room.

1159
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:53,893
Yeah. But, um, it'll
cost you 25 bucks.

1160
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,232
15!

1161
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,897
Sold.

1162
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,737
She'll be right with you.
She's just getting dressed.

1163
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,798
Okay, thanks.

1164
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:10,412
Does it make you feel weird
knowing she's naked only,
like, ten feet away.

1165
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,011
Em!

1166
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,612
Coming.

1167
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,748
Stomach.

1168
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,052
No. Pay me.

1169
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,116
I'll pay you after.
Give me the stomach.

1170
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:21,493
A promise from Thea?
I can't take that to the
bank. Just pay me know.

1171
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,927
Thank you.
Here's your fake belly.

1172
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:29,972
Shut up. Get out.

1173
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,567
Hello.

1174
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,803
Hey.

1175
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,778
(Emma)
Okay.

1176
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,177
Hey.

1177
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,773
Um, I, I just,
I thought I'd
stop by, uh...

1178
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,785
I wanted to show
you something.

1179
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:48,290
It's our very first
complete copy of the book
with cover and everything.

1180
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,021
That's, that's great!
And, wow, I'm on the cover.

1181
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,531
Oh. And we booked,
uh, Tynan's bookstore
for the book launch.

1182
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:56,895
That's awesome.

1183
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,127
Well, um, I
should probably
get outta here

1184
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,067
and let you
enjoy your Saturday.

1185
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,833
Well, um, if you're
free then do you
wanna get coffee?

1186
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,169
Sure.

1187
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:12,677
(Nick)
I had a dog once. Then
Jerry stole it, took it
to college with him.

1188
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,239
Oh. [chuckles]

1189
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,650
There's something amazing
about having a child.

1190
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:23,056
It makes you
feel like a part
of something bigger,

1191
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:27,722
you know,
even if it's not real.
Well, for me, that is.

1192
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,559
Lydia didn't want children.
And I never questioned it.

1193
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,866
But now I,

1194
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:41,900
I realize, I, I do
wanna be a father.

1195
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:05,091
I've been wanting to do
that for a really long time.

1196
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,466
Actually, I just,
just did that.

1197
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,164
Right.

1198
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,968
We should probably take
things slowly though.

1199
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,508
Absolutely.

1200
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:15,305
Yeah.

1201
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,456
I have to...
I just realized...

1202
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,084
I have to go.

1203
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,652
There's somewhere...
I have to go somewhere.

1204
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:35,891
Sure. Okay.

1205
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,830
My sister...
I'll talk to you later.

1206
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,231
Okay.

1207
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,769
[soft music]

1208
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,549
Yes, she's due
the sixth of October.

1209
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,215
Alright. Okay.

1210
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,521
That was your
friend, Rachel.
And these are for you.

1211
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,494
She saw the book
at Crown Books.

1212
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,928
How come you didn't
tell her you were pregnant?

1213
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,466
I thought I
told her. It must
have slipped my mind.

1214
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,126
Pregnancy brain.

1215
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,296
I was planning
on waiting a little
longer to start a family.

1216
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,602
Sow my wild oats
a little bit.

1217
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,769
But, I feel like there is
a larger purpose for me.

1218
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:27,009
Thea, you need
someone who is
smart and responsible.

1219
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,607
Oh, God.

1220
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,212
I offer myself to you,
mind and body,
heart and soul.

1221
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,756
Let me be your
baby daddy.

1222
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,487
Uh-uh-uh, that's
very generous of you.

1223
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,793
But it's, you know...
that's not gonna ha...

1224
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,629
Don't worry about it.
It's a tough decision.

1225
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,602
Thea, can I
talk to you?

1226
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,137
Yeah, sure, yes.

1227
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,467
Yes, absolutely.

1228
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,405
If you could
let me know
before lunch.

1229
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,340
I have a J date
I'd have to cancel.

1230
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,777
I don't want to
do that if I don't have
to. She's a little older...

1231
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,472
So you're
ready for tonight?

1232
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,542
Yeah. Totally.

1233
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,814
We should clear the air.

1234
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,883
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened.

1235
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,122
And I feel
terrible about it.

1236
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,789
You do?

1237
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,528
I'm your boss and
I made... [whispers]
I made a pass at you.

1238
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,900
Nick, that's not it.
I made a pass at you.

1239
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,166
I caught that pass
and I threw it back.

1240
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,264
And I liked it.

1241
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:26,672
You did?

1242
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,540
Look, that's not
what it is,

1243
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,278
I'm just afraid of...

1244
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:36,648
There's a guy, Philip,
at reception. He says
he's the father?

1245
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,311
Do want me
to talk to this guy?

1246
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,184
No, no, no.
It's okay.

1247
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,518
(Greg)
I'll talk to him.

1248
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,923
It's okay.
Thank you both.
Excuse me.

1249
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,757
Young man, don't
you have any sense
of responsibility?

1250
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,662
I didn't even
know, lady. She
never returned my calls.

1251
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:52,326
Christ, is it
mine, Thea?

1252
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,800
Believe me,
it's not yours.

1253
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,031
(Phillip)
You can't be sure.
I did the math.

1254
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,436
Believe me.
I can be sure.

1255
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,202
(Philip)
I demand a DNA test!

1256
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,333
Yeah. I'll tell her.

1257
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:01,808
Bye.

1258
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,675
(Ann)
Your sister
needs you at home.

1259
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:05,338
A fire
in the toilet?

1260
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:08,406
Your toilet's
on fire? Isn't that
technically impossible?

1261
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,883
Who's Philip?

1262
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,978
Uh, an old,
old boyfriend.
Big misunderstanding.

1263
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,317
Everything okay?

1264
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,984
Yeah. Everything's okay.
No worries here.

1265
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,995
Completely under control.
But, uh, I, I should probably
get home to my sister.

1266
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,554
I'll meet you
at the party.
Whoa. Sorry.

1267
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,238
[all]
Surprise!

1268
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,646
[applause]
Surprise!

1269
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:42,575
[gasps]

1270
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,142
Hi, everyone.

1271
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,881
Oh my God,
Aunt Betty!

1272
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,583
Surprise, darlin'. Darlin'.

1273
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,456
It's so good
to see you.

1274
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,519
Aunt Jane
and I just drove
in from Seattle.

1275
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,760
Oh, Aunt,
thank you, it's so
sweet of you to do this.

1276
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,325
(Thea)
Thank you.

1277
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,233
[all gasp]
Oooh!

1278
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,332
Ooh, it's a onesies.
Just what I needed.

1279
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,933
We all decorated them.

1280
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,875
Who made this one?

1281
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,173
And this one?

1282
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,774
[speaks baby gibberish]

1283
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,615
What a good job, Sam!

1284
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,177
[chuckles]

1285
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,847
[total silence]

1286
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,652
That one's mine.

1287
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,249
(Emma)
I just thought

1288
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,795
it was
a little ironic.
[doorbell]

1289
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,458
(Donna)
More people are
coming. Hi. Who is it?

1290
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,263
(Lisa)
Whoa. [laughs]

1291
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,897
(Lisa)
Hey, well, I hate
to break up the party,
but, uh, we need to talk.

1292
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,907
(Lisa)
Everybody hang
onto your seats

1293
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,205
just in case something
happens to her story.

1294
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:44,178
Uh, no, I should get changed.
I need to be at a work event.

1295
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,442
So thank you
for the shower, everyone.

1296
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,312
Thank you.

1297
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,681
(woman)
Bye.

1298
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,757
She is so out
of control. Look.
She has stockpiled

1299
01:04:56,826 --> 01:05:00,956
all of this random stuff
in her closet. I mean,
what is this? Seriously.

1300
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,691
It was on sale.

1301
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:06,428
Okay. I need you to say,
My name is Thea and I
am not pregnant.

1302
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:09,130
This is ridiculous.
And I've gotta go.

1303
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,331
Come here.

1304
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,741
(Lisa)
You have got
to come clean.

1305
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:20,782
I will. Okay?
I promise. Just not yet.

1306
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:24,581
It's just I'm better
pregnant. For once,
my life doesn't suck.

1307
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:28,488
And I can't go
back to being Jerry's
secretary or unemployed.

1308
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,993
(Emma)
What are you gonna
do? Stay pregnant for
the rest of your life?

1309
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:35,519
People will
get suspicious.

1310
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,930
Act like a grown-up.
Stop playing dress-up.

1311
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,265
(Emma)
Oh, my God, this
is ridiculous. Take
off the stomach now!

1312
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,497
No.

1313
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,300
Then I'm gonna
take it off for you.

1314
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,567
Get off of me!

1315
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,801
Let me take it off!

1316
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,070
Get off of me.

1317
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:51,602
Oh, hey!
Hey, guys!
Emma, stop it!

1318
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,239
[muffled]
(Lisa)
Stop it!

1319
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,578
(Emma)
Let me take it off!

1320
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,083
Making noise.

1321
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:57,380
They are
making noise.

1322
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,647
Hey! Stop it!

1323
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,847
T ake that thing off.

1324
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,482
(Lisa)
I said stop. Gosh.

1325
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,822
(Lisa)
Come on.

1326
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,054
Stay back!

1327
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,652
I'll get that
thing off of you.

1328
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,856
Get off of me!

1329
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,626
I'm gonna take
that thing off now!

1330
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,724
Give it back!

1331
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,098
[ripping]
Agh.

1332
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,727
What are you doing?
[gasps]

1333
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,998
[gasps]

1334
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,266
[panting]

1335
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,171
You are so grounded!

1336
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,503
Forever!

1337
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:28,416
(Lisa)
Uh, ladies.

1338
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,418
I think we need
to re-group.

1339
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,353
(Emma)
Stark raving mad.

1340
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,151
[rhythmic music]

1341
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:39,685
Excuse me.

1342
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:40,786
[gasp]

1343
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,296
[cheerful music]

1344
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,526
(Aunt Betty)
What are you doing?

1345
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,371
(woman)
I thought
she was pregnant.

1346
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:53,533
[sighs]

1347
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,600
Um.

1348
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,543
(woman)
I'm really confused.

1349
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:12,992
Well, that is the last
time I throw a surprise
party for anyone.

1350
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,791
That baked zitti
goes home with me.

1351
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,859
[walla]

1352
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,904
Sorry. I had to take
care of things with Em.

1353
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,463
The toilet fire?

1354
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,372
Yeah, I
got the blaze
under control.

1355
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,310
You guys are
amazing. This is a
great turnout. Thank you.

1356
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,279
Okay.

1357
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:37,115
Time to struggle
with public speaking.
Sit back and enjoy.

1358
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,551
You're gonna
be great.

1359
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,645
Thanks.

1360
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,019
[kissing sound]

1361
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,816
What was that?
Are you guys...

1362
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,386
I don't know.
Maybe. Kinda.

1363
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,931
(Suzie)
Hey. Good.

1364
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:54,026
Good evening,
everyone. I'm back!

1365
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,571
(Jerry)
MacArthur finished
rehab a week early.

1366
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,268
What's the
matter, Nicky? You
don't look happy to see me.

1367
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,209
Of course I am, Jerry.
Welcome back.

1368
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,440
You're just in time
for Suzie's reading.

1369
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,175
I got a little
surprise for you.

1370
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,275
I just signed Rumsfeld
for his first book deal!

1371
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,717
Donald?

1372
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,914
No, Carlos.
Of course Donald.

1373
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,980
I met him
at the rehab facility.

1374
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,049
His cat had a terrible
case of sciatica.

1375
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,858
They had to put the poor
thing on oxycontin. She
got addicted. It was a mess.

1376
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,660
I'm in the middle
of something.

1377
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,565
Rummy's book
is genius. It's gonna
put us back on the map.

1378
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,263
It's a completely unique
opus about his time in Iraq

1379
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,636
sprinkled with some
of his favorite recipes.

1380
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,175
It's called "Fire It Up."
Here's the manuscript.

1381
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,508
It sounds great, Jerry,
but I've got a reading
now. Can this wait?

1382
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,810
You know what?
I'll be reading my book.

1383
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,476
(Jerry)
I'm shutting down
your little operation.

1384
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,450
Jerry, Suzie's
book is a real gem.

1385
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,217
It could be a hit
for the company.

1386
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,782
What are you so
afraid of? That I might
do a better job than you?

1387
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,022
Hmm. Let me think.

1388
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:57,725
Have you ever done better
than me at anything?

1389
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,133
Hello, everybody. I've got
a treat for you tonight.

1390
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:04,434
I'm gonna
be reading from Donald
Rumsfeld's new book.

1391
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,873
Here's a particularly
touching passage

1392
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:10,343
about a short rib
recipe he picked
up while in Baghdad.

1393
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:13,609
Suzie's reading.
Go read your cookbook
somewhere else, Jerry.

1394
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,116
Step away
from the podium now!

1395
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,209
[rhythmic music]

1396
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,254
Make me.

1397
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,080
He begins.

1398
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,317
Agh!

1399
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,416
[all gasp while Jerry
and Nick growl]

1400
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,890
(Nick)
Get off!

1401
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,833
(Thea)
Okay. Okay.
Stop it! That's enough.

1402
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:37,100
That's enough.
Stop it. Get off of him.

1403
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,734
How pathetic. You
have to have your
secretary defend you.

1404
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,333
She's not a secretary.

1405
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,471
Oh, really?
Then what is
she, other than shrill?

1406
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,176
She's a fantastic editor.

1407
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:52,152
[laughs mockingly]
Oh, that's rich.
An editor?

1408
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:56,089
So I go away for a few
months, and the world's
lamest accountant

1409
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,184
is running
my company with
the world's dumbest secretary.

1410
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,627
(Jerry)
All I can say is,

1411
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,131
I hope your kid
doesn't inherit your brains.

1412
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,929
[shrieks]

1413
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,195
[all gasp]
Oh!

1414
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:09,032
(Suzie)
Be careful!
Be careful

1415
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,366
Oh, God!

1416
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:12,731
[plop]

1417
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,173
[all gasp]

1418
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,711
[all]
Oh.

1419
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,577
(Ann)
What happened
to your stomach?

1420
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:29,115
Oh, Nicky.

1421
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,092
You always were such
a good judge of character.

1422
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,426
Nick. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:39,593
I never meant
for things to
go this far.

1424
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:43,968
Jerry was gonna
fire me and I couldn't
afford to get fired.

1425
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,736
And I thought the whole
thing would blow over
in a day or two.

1426
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,278
Blow over
in a day or two?

1427
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,616
What kind
of person pretends
to be pregnant?

1428
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,188
Nick. I'm sorry. Just...

1429
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,160
Please, just... Nick.

1430
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,759
[cheerful music]

1431
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,841
Hey, Nick, it's Thea, um

1432
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,110
I'm kinda wondering
what you're up to.

1433
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,676
Kinda of assuming
that what you're up
to is hating me.

1434
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,747
Kinda feeling very
bad about that.

1435
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,292
Anyway. Call me.

1436
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,124
Hi, Nick.
Thea again.

1437
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,567
I just wanna say
that I'm so so sorry.

1438
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,161
(Claire on TV)
I was talking to
your mother about it.

1439
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,571
She and I
are on the same
page on this thing.

1440
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:56,805
I would rather say
extra virgin olive oil.
I don't wanna abbreviate it.

1441
01:11:56,879 --> 01:12:01,373
Hi, Nick, it's me. Uh.

1442
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,419
I know you haven't
been interested in
picking up the phone

1443
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:08,547
But I just wanted
to tell you how
much I really, really...
[tone]

1444
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,756
[doorbell]

1445
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,669
(Thea)
Hi.

1446
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,796
(Lisa)
Hi!

1447
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,807
Wow!

1448
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,376
So...

1449
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,439
what have
you been up to?

1450
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:38,111
Watching the Vista
on an endless loop.

1451
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,984
It's self-inflicted torture.

1452
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,647
That sounds healthy.

1453
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,591
Well, it smells
like something
died in here.

1454
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,150
It did.

1455
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,321
My soul.

1456
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,991
Thea. You've gotta give
yourself a tiny break.

1457
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,294
People make mistakes.

1458
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,801
I majorly screwed up.

1459
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,962
Well, look on
the bright side.

1460
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,165
They're still talking
about it at work.

1461
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,366
How's Nick doing?

1462
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,875
I don't know.
He resigned.

1463
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:03,639
What?

1464
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,976
Did he say anything
about what he's gonna do?

1465
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:09,381
If you're asking me if he
said he'd track you down
and propose to you

1466
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,817
and spend the rest
of your lives together?

1467
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,650
No. He wasn't specific.

1468
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,486
I've been calling
him and calling him.

1469
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,423
And he won't call me back.

1470
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,587
Yeah, well maybe that
has something to do

1471
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:24,428
with the massively twisted
lie you've told him for
the last few months.

1472
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,434
Do you think
he'll ever forgive me?

1473
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:31,970
Do you want me to be
honest or do you want me
to make you feel better?

1474
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,338
How are Suzie's book sales?

1475
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,207
Good.

1476
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:40,180
You know, uh, there's
still a few boxes

1477
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,547
that we need to
distribute here and there.

1478
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,880
Oh, no.

1479
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,160
Sorry.

1480
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,927
Hey.

1481
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,229
Hey.

1482
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,599
Mind if I join you?

1483
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,662
It's a free country.

1484
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,643
Hm. What's
in this? Mint?

1485
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,278
Yup.

1486
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,789
It's perfect
with the pear.

1487
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,655
It's so unexpected.

1488
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:28,423
That was actually, um,
my idea. I kind of just
thought it would work.

1489
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,861
Dad would
have loved it.

1490
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,562
Mom would have
thought it was too fussy.

1491
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:39,198
But she would have
polished off the leftovers
after everyone went to bed.

1492
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,347
I'm a big fat liar
and I'm sorry you
got stuck with me.

1493
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,181
Listen, Em.
We're gonna make
this work. Okay?

1494
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:56,213
I made an appointment
with the Culinary Institute
to talk about student loans.

1495
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:59,886
And I talked
to Ms. Talbot
about scholarships.

1496
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:03,193
You know,
Mom and Dad would
have been so proud of you.

1497
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,857
Thanks.

1498
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:07,299
[cheerful music]

1499
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,273
It needs, um...

1500
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,205
I think
ten more minutes.

1501
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:22,807
I don't have
ten more minutes.

1502
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,648
But it's gonna
be all gooey inside.

1503
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,483
I'll just have
to take my chances.

1504
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,718
(man)
Here she comes. Here
comes Claire, everybody.

1505
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,021
[crowd cheers]
(woman)
I love you.

1506
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,289
I haven't missed
a show in five years.

1507
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,331
Thank you. But you
should get out more.

1508
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:37,558
I'm kidding.

1509
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,498
I'm Thea Clayhill,
your biggest fan.

1510
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:42,332
I made you
a pineapple cake. It's
your favorite, right?

1511
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,497
Yes. Good
reconnaissance.
Good for you.

1512
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,906
How did you know
about the cake?

1513
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,570
Her May 15th show.
She said it in passing.

1514
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,344
Hi. I have some
books for you.

1515
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,612
Oh, great. Just leave
'em right over there.

1516
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,984
Okay. Keep your womb open.

1517
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,579
You've got it.

1518
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,218
I actually would like
even more toppings
on my-- Hello.

1519
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,627
Hey. Thea Clayhill,
your number one fan
with banana cream pie.

1520
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,189
You do your homework.
I hope it's as delicious
as your pineapple cake.

1521
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,874
[slams door]

1522
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,105
You can
hit a few more
potholes next time.

1523
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,476
(man)
Claire, I love you.

1524
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,037
(Woman)
There she is. Claire.

1525
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,481
There she is.
My number one
fan, Thea Clayhill.

1526
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:31,485
Uh, pear ginger pie.

1527
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,612
Nicely done,
Betty Crocker.

1528
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,919
It's actually not me,
it's my little sister.

1529
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,084
what's your angle
besides making me a pig?

1530
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,957
Wanna get your
little sister on TV?

1531
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,486
I really want to get
this book on TV. It's
really special.

1532
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,693
Okay. Thank you.

1533
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,133
Thanks.

1534
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:50,865
(Lisa)
Good luck.

1535
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:03,818
Hi.

1536
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,648
Hi.

1537
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,087
I bet I'm the last
person you wanted
to see right now.

1538
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:14,560
[sighs] Well, maybe
not the last person.

1539
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,224
Maybe the second
or third to last person.

1540
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:21,429
I wouldn't want to see my
6th grade English teacher,
Ms. Posey. She was awful.

1541
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,631
Or my college boyfriend.
He dumped me on an
answering machine.

1542
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:28,073
Listen, Suzie.
I'm really sorry,

1543
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:31,306
I really wish I could
have been the person
you thought I was.

1544
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,348
I just figured
if I told you the truth,

1545
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:37,511
you wouldn't want me
in your life and I really
enjoyed being in yours.

1546
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,612
I really enjoyed
being in your life, too,

1547
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,714
for what it's worth.

1548
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:45,089
Well, I've got some
really good news.

1549
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,320
We're gonna...

1550
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,589
Ow!

1551
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,324
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

1552
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,423
[yelling, panting]
The baby's coming.

1553
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,592
Right now?

1554
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,295
My water broke
this morning.

1555
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,599
My contractions
started an hour ago. Ow!

1556
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,071
Where is everyone?

1557
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,870
[panting]
Jesse's on his way.

1558
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:05,970
What should I do? Hot water?
Towels? Let's just get in the
car and go to the hospital.

1559
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:09,347
A lot of people can
help us there. I can't
really do much here.

1560
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,511
No, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1561
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,281
My contraction ended.

1562
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,289
It'll be hours before
I have this baby.

1563
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,790
It's already
that painful?

1564
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,258
[sighs]
You ain't seen
nothin' yet.

1565
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:22,490
It's gonna get
a whole lot worse before
we turn this mother out.

1566
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,555
What were you saying?

1567
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,396
Oh, um, the Vista
wants you.

1568
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,026
[both scream]

1569
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,570
Are you sure
this is normal?

1570
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:33,631
Yes, it's fine.
The Vista? That's
amazing. When?

1571
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,007
In two hours.
They had a cancellation.

1572
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:38,638
Yeah. That's not
gonna work for me.

1573
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,683
[both breathe]

1574
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,548
Hurry! We're
gonna be late!

1575
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:47,918
[cheerful music]

1576
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:50,920
Hello.

1577
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,598
Hi.

1578
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,328
[baby cries]

1579
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,064
(Lisa)
I think I'm sitting on
something. Like this.

1580
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:07,074
[babies cry]
Hey, Em, it's me.
I desperately need a favor.

1581
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,804
Here you go.
Don't cry.

1582
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,712
[knocks]

1583
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,313
Emma.

1584
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:22,481
Hi, Nick.

1585
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:23,785
What are
you doing here?

1586
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,417
I have to take
you somewhere.

1587
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,155
Excuse me?

1588
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,356
[sighs]
Please, don't
make me explain.

1589
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,991
So if you just
get your keys.
We really have to go.

1590
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,193
Emma.

1591
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,667
Come on!

1592
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,705
(Claire)
You're pulling our
legs. Collectively.

1593
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:41,106
We absolutely have
to begin in 3 minutes.
Your guy better get here.

1594
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,700
I promise
he'll be here.

1595
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,212
He'll be here.
It's gonna be great.

1596
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,407
I don't know what's
keeping him so long.

1597
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,882
It'd be really fun
to have you back again.

1598
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,784
(Claire)
When we come back,
"I'm So Over This,

1599
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:55,721
What It's Really Like
to Be Pregnant."
So stick around.

1600
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,951
[clapping]

1601
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,822
I need four asses
in those seats now.

1602
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,759
Oh, my God, Lisa.
What are we gonna do?

1603
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:01,921
You're gonna go.

1604
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,089
What?

1605
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:04,291
I don't wanna go.

1606
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,669
(Claire)
How are you?
Thank you. Loved the book.

1607
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:12,833
Come on in. Hello,
little baby. Come on up.

1608
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,239
Hi. Hello.

1609
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,870
(Claire)
Wow, Laura.
What an amazing story.

1610
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,109
I cannot believe that
beautiful baby was
born at the DMV.

1611
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:24,118
So Thea,
any kids?

1612
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,177
No, never
been pregnant.

1613
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,485
So why another pregnancy
book? Isn't the market
a bit flooded?

1614
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,492
(Thea)
Well, this
one's different.

1615
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,656
It's not a how-to
book or a bunch of
rules and recipes.

1616
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,188
These stories
are ultimately about
the birth of a new love.

1617
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,461
(Emma)
We're late.

1618
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,469
I can't believe she
booked with Vista.

1619
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,028
It can be messy
but in the end
you're much stronger

1620
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:46,698
for having
gone through it.

1621
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:50,040
(Thea)
Even if you did
something you may regret.

1622
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:53,342
And to be honest,
I was just helping out.

1623
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:57,749
You know, I shouldn't
even really be sitting up
here. It was Nick Steinwald

1624
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,946
who's sitting in
the audience right now.

1625
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,955
He's responsible
for the whole thing.

1626
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:05,754
He believed in the book
from the beginning and...

1627
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,727
believed in me.

1628
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:11,027
and I really can't thank
him enough for that.

1629
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,068
[clapping]
Stand up!

1630
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,471
(Claire)
Get him a mike.

1631
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:27,073
She sings your praises.
What is about the book
that appealed to you?

1632
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:30,743
Um, well, uh...

1633
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:34,585
I thought Suzie's book
had a fresh and funny
perspective on pregnancy.

1634
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,681
Thea was right when
she said it was a book

1635
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:38,988
about how love can
see you through anything.

1636
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,491
And how...

1637
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,090
if you love someone,

1638
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:50,194
you can forgive
them for all of the...

1639
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,537
crazy and idiotic
things they do.

1640
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:56,668
Because love
is a leap of faith.

1641
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,373
And...

1642
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,245
sometimes you just
have to jump.

1643
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,717
Don't you?

1644
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,453
Wow. Okay. I'm gonna
jump in here for a second

1645
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:14,791
and, uh, thank you both
so much. Again, the book
is "I'm So Over This,

1646
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,195
What It's Really
Like to Be Pregnant."

1647
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,699
There's a link on
our website, TheVista.com

1648
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,794
One last thing, Nick.
Do you know how
cute you are?

1649
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,236
Uh, no.
[all laugh]

1650
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,240
(Claire)
No, he
doesn't, does he?

1651
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,539
[laughs]
Okay, thank
you very much.
[applause]

1652
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:51,323
(Claire)
Hey. Guess what?

1653
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,890
The producer
said there's been
over 1 00,000 hits

1654
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,200
on the show's link
to your book. Yeah.

1655
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:58,261
That's fantastic.

1656
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,500
Thanks, Claire.

1657
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:00,973
(Claire)
Thank you.

1658
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,271
Hey.

1659
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,205
Thank you.

1660
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:09,216
It's the least
I could do.

1661
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:12,742
I meant what I said
about I can't thank
you enough,

1662
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,688
you know, now
that it's all over.

1663
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:16,951
What's over?

1664
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,921
Working together,

1665
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,487
being together, just
togetherness in general.

1666
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:24,896
[soft guitar music]

1667
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,763
It doesn't have to be.

1668
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,702
We made a good
book together. We
can make another one.

1669
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,762
Would you
wanna do that?

1670
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,138
Yes. Yes, I would.

1671
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,025
Still feel backed up?

1672
01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,589
Thanks, Greg.

1673
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,225
(Nick)
Should it
freak me out

1674
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,634
that he knows
more about your
bowels than I do?

1675
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,297
Uh, maybe that's
a good thing.

1676
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,702
If I've been timing
these right, and
I'm sure I have,

1677
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:12,838
you're up in ten,
nine, eight, seven...

1678
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,381
Ow!

1679
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,246
(Jerry)
Yes! Just six
seconds off.

1680
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:17,477
What I'd miss?

1681
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,452
We're contracting
every half hour.

1682
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:21,113
You okay?

1683
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:23,680
(Garth)
we're gonna kick
this puppy out at 0900.

1684
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,350
(Ann)
They should
head out now.

1685
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:26,917
No one's
going anywhere

1686
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:29,088
the doctor
said to wait
until every 15...

1687
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,495
[screams]

1688
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,328
Wait. You're way off.

1689
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,265
That one was not good.

1690
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,200
Jesus. She's
having a baby. Now!

1691
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,568
(Thea)
What do you mean?

1692
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,072
Okay. No, no, no.

1693
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,903
What the hell
are we going to do?

1694
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,306
Move! Move!

1695
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,868
(Kristen)
My baby got ten
on the APGAR scores

1696
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,176
your baby's maybe
like a seven or a eight.

1697
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,648
(Carl)
If it's a boy, feel
free to name him Carl.

1698
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,548
I forgot. Okay.

1699
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,143
(Kristen)
Get the epidural.

1700
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,212
(Jerry)
Don't screw this up.

1701
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,621
Are you ready?

1702
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:57,988
Let's hope.

1703
01:24:58,059 --> 01:24:59,651
I Love you.

1704
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,718
(Thea)
I love you, too.
It's your fault.

1705
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,024
Semper Fi.

1706
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,089
(Kristen)
Push! [laughs]
Oh, not yet.
