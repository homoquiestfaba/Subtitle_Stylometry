00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,833
Gordon will be treated just like
every other accused felon

177
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,700
whether his father is
running for mayor or not.

178
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,966
You understand what
I'm saying, Gordon?

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
He's right. We have to play
this by the numbers, for now.

180
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,100
Whatever we do, we've
got to get out of here.

181
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,366
The press'll be here any minute.

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,966
Take care of him, Charles.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Yeah, he'll be fine.

184
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,033
Dad, you mean I gotta stay here?

185
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,266
I'm sorry, son. We'll get
you out as soon as we can.

186
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,500
[Gordon Sr.]
I'll talk to you later, okay?

187
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,700
I don't understand this
attitude, Charles.

188
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:23,033
Her name was Isabella Rodriguez.

189
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:27,333
She was 38 years old. She was a
mother of two little kids.

190
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,133
Junior, here, is criminally
responsible for her death.

191
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,133
What don't you
understand about that?

192
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:45,800
You scared?

193
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,633
Good.

194
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,533
You should be.

195
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,500
[Thunder erupts]

196
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,166
Come on.

197
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,566
It' time for Igor's bath.

198
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,066
Hey.

199
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,333
This is a nice neighborhood.

200
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:35,566
Yeah. It's a Russian priest from
the cemetery...it's his church.

201
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,800
All hells breaking loose inside.

202
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,233
Why? What's going on?

203
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,666
I don't know. I'm getting maybe
one word out of twelve.

204
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,866
But it's got nothing to
do with labor trouble.

205
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,133
Let's take a look.

206
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,233
[tense dialog in Russian]

207
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,766
I am brother Yurii.
May I help you?

208
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,300
Yeah, my name's Jack Reed. I'm
with the Sheriff's department.

209
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,533

What's going on?

210
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,600
Her name is Irina Lebed.

211
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,933
Her husband was one of
the men killed at the
cemetery this morning.

212
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,000
She says...

213
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,633
People are murdered
in broad daylight.

214
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,066
The police laugh and
shake their heads.

215
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,733
Nothing is done.

216
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,500
Is this what America is about?

217
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,900
Professor Suvorov, a great man.

218
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,133
[Brother Yurii]
His son is gone.

219
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,466
Vanished.

220
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,700
The police do not care.

221
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:34,133
They smile only; that's it.

222
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,733
And people are robbed.

223
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:38,833
They... they are beaten.

224
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:42,533
They... they disappear.

225
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:45,000
And no one cares.

226
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,733
[Brother Yurii]
And this morning, three are dead

227
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:53,600

madman, the Butcher.

228
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,800

Russia. This is...

What are you doing here?

233
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,600
This is a Holy place.

234
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,333
Do you think you
can frighten me?

235

Do you think you
can frighten God?!

No! No.

Policemen, now you come.

For what? A piece of plaster?!

242
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,933
What about us?! What
about the living?!

243
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,466
Who's the Mad Man?

My name is Jack Reed, ma'am.

I'm a policeman too.

246
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,700
Uh, you said that, uh, people
were killed by the Mad Man

247
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,433

are you talking about?

Little Wolves?

Come on, lady, talk to me.
I'll try to help you.

No. No.

I don't believe you.

Ahhh, no. No!

Let's roust 'em, Jack.

You think they'll
confess, Eddie?

'Cause there sure as hell ain't
gonna be any witnesses.

here? Where are the cops?

vehicular homicide and
driving while impaired.

Sanford Miller, advisor
to mayoral candidate
Gordon Thomas Senior

265
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:23,466

political motive behind the

Mr. Thomas?

Mr. Thomas, any comment?
Any comment at all, sir?

We demand...

269
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:30,400

this tragic accident

270
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,866
be taken from the
Sheriff's Department

271
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,666
and conducted by the office
of the District Attorney.

272
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,133
That is my statement.

273
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:47,866
Sandy Miller was always
a cop-hating creep.

What have we got?

Open and shut.

up to the stop light.

into the intersection, slowly;

it's an old rust-bucket. Bam.

00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
Thomas never touched his brakes.

280

He's doing 70 or 80
in a 35 mile zone.

281
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,633
He's speeding, he runs a red
light, and he's impaired.

There it is.

283
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:07,900
What about the cough medicine?

284
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,833
I didn't find any bottle.
And his blood doesn't
indicate any medication.

Like you said, open and shut.

no-win deal, Lieutenant.

gonna walk one way or the other.

around for years, whether
he's Mayor or not.

precinct before you started

about these teenage gangs?

Yeah, penny ante crap.

and nobody talks to the cops.

And we are not the U.N.
We're not social workers.

problems, especially if they
won't speak to us.

the bus, can we?

here on the right someplace.

it. Satan, himself.

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,166
Don't worry, Vassily. I will
return. I will save you.

349
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,333
Remember, kill Satan.

350
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,666
I'll be back.

351
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,466
[Jack]
Guess it must be the top floor.

352
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,433
[Eddie]
Why are they always
on the top floor?

353
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,400
[Jack]
Ah, stop complaining. It's
good for your girlish figure.

354
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,700
But it's terrible for my knee.

355
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,800
Maybe we should get
some back-up...

356
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,600
[Jack]
C'mon.

357
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:27,433
We'll just see if
anybody's home.

358
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,700
Officers under fire at
135 Kenyon Street.

359
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:38,100
It's that pain the
ass, Reed, again.

360
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,533
I think somebody's home.

361
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe we should have
called for back-up.

362
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:49,333
[In Russian]
Come in, see what happens!

363
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,466
What'd he say?

364
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,166
I don't know, but he's cranky.

365
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,100
Stay back, pal. He's got a gun!

366
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,933
It's okay. He's my
crazy brother, huh.

367
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:05,233
Hey--hey, don't go
in there. Hey!

368
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:07,000
Vassily! It's me!

369
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,333
[in Russian]
It's me!

370
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,300
Remember, be brave.

371
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,233
They cannot hurt you.
You are juvenile.

372
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,866
I will protect you.
I will save you.

373
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,033
Fool! Do you think you
can kill everyone?!

374
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:21,900
Huh?! It's all right.
I... I have gun.

375
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,066
All right, get down
here. Get down.

376
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,733
You got the right
to remain silent.

377
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,600
[Eddie]
You got the right
to legal counsel.

378
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,800
You got the right to
unlimited phone calls.

379
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,866
You got the right to cable TV.

380
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,900
You got the right to pizza three
times a week with toppings of
your choice.

381
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,733
All right, come on.
Let's go. Get up here.

382
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,433
Hey, Jack.

383
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,500
Hey.

384
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:50,566
That the cemetery shooter?

385
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,366
That's him. He just took a
couple shots at us too.

386
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,033
- Yeah, I heard. Good work.
- Thanks.

387
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,433
I'll go and talk to
you for a minute.

388
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,566
I don't wanna bust
your hump, Lieutenant

389
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,366
but you gotta deal with
some of these calls.

390
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,966
You got a congressman here,
two state senators, and a
couple of aldermen.

391
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,666
Old friends, so they say.

392
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,633
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see.

393
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,366
C'mon in, Jack. Close the door.

394
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,133
Okay.

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,466
[Charles]
Have you heard about
Gordon Thomas's kid?

396
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,866
Yeah. Vehicular homicide, huh?

397
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,033
He's in the big leagues now.

398
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,900
Pete Myers been
on the phone yet?

399
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:22,100
They were here, the whole
crew, including Hobart.

400
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,933
[Charles]
They want a mittimus, of course.

401
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,500
Of course. They move the
investigation downtown.

402
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,900
Hobart kicks it around
accidentally on purpose

403
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,966
and the judge throws it out.

404
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,866
[Jack]
Let it go, Charles.

405
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,033
You gotta pick your fights.
You can't win this one.

406
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:40,700
Do they really believe that
I'd try to screw the kid to
hurt his old man?

407
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,166
I mean, we were friends once.

408
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,733
[Jack]
It's got nothing to
do with the kid.

409
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:48,700
This is big-time
politics. Thomas is
gonna be the next mayor.

410
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,400
Maybe the vice president
in a few years.

411
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:54,033
[Jack]
You're up against money,
power, and People magazine.

412
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,466
Who cares if he got
a screwed-up kid?

413
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,133
Isabella Rodriguez's family.

414
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,333
[Jack]
Oh, they'll get to them too.

415
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:03,766
Sandy Miller'll pay 'em a visit.

416
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
It'll turn out that their family
junker had bad breaks.

417
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,633
[Jack]
It rolled right in front of
Thomas's car or something.

418
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,366
I-I-I don't like this job today.

419
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,500
Why do you think you're here?

420
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,233
All these politicians trying
to get you on the phone

421
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,866
they helped get you this job.

422
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,266
You think they were just doing
a favor for a brother?

423
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
It's payback time, pal.

424
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,100
You hold on a minute, Jack. That
has nothing to do with this--

425
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:30,366
Hey, hey. Come on, now, don't
get sensitive on me.

426
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:35,700
[Jack]
It ain't just you. If you are
Irish and Thomas was

427
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:39,400
some Mick alderman from the west
side trying to get Uncle Seamus
out of a jam

428
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,233
you'd roll over in a minute.

429
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:47,933
Charles, Affirmative Action is
hardly a new concept in Chicago.
It's just new for black folks.

430
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,100
But there is a price.

431
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,633
There's always a price.

432
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,866
Kick it to the D. A.'s office.

433
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,366
[Jack]
Look, don't beat yourself
up up about this, Charles.

434
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,666
It's your turn in the barrel.

435
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,766
It's Chicago.

436
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,933
He's a juvenile, Jack.

437
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:28,766
He's what?

438
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,766
He's 17 years old.

439
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,833
His, uh, step-brother here,
Mr. Gulov, brought his papers.

440
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,900
He looks 10 years
older than that.

441
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,866
[Sergei]
Poor boy. Hard life.

442
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,400
You work at the cemetery too,
don't you, Mr. Gulov?

443
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:46,400
Yes, half-time. No,
not, uh, half-time.

444
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,800
Part-time?

445
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, part-time.

446
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:53,100
Mind if I ask, uh, what you
are doing this morning when
the shooting started?

447
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:57,333
Yes, I was in the north section,
uh, passing stone.

448
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:58,400
What?

449
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,300
A headstone, big one.
I was passing it.

450
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,400
[Jack]
You were moving it?

451
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,900
[Sergei]
Ah, yes, uh, moving
it. I'm stupid.

452
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,900
I can take Vassily
home now, yes?

453
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,633
[Eddie]
You can take Vassily home, no.

454
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,933
But, uh, he is, how
you say, juvenile, no?

455
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:14,566
[Jack]
A juvenile. Yeah... [laughing]

456
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,500
If you remember, Mr. Gulov, he
tried to kill us this morning.

457
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:22,100
And, uh, he's gonna be charged
with murder times three, for
the cemetery killings.

458
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,500
We got the shotgun.
We got the shells.

459
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,666
We got his fingerprints. We got
the residue all over him.

460
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,800
No, he's, uh... he's not
going anywhere for a while.

461
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,300
If you wanna help him, I suggest
you give him a good lawyer.

462
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:35,466
But, uh, thanks for coming in.

463
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:39,066
Ah, what about car?

464
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,966
What?

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,466
My car. I--I need for work.

466
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,233
[Jack]
Impounded, Mr. Gulov,
for evidence.

467
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:48,233
But that car belongs to the
cemetery, doesn't it?

468
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,300
Yes, of course.
I must call them.

469
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:55,333
But they let you drive
it, huh? A half-timer?

470
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:59,500
Nyet. No, no, not me.

471
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,100
Vassily.

472
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,533
Because they are afraid of him.

473
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,466
[Jack]
Oh.

474
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,133
Apparently with reason.

475
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:12,066
We'll, uh... we'll be in touch.

476
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:23,666
Well, I guess I better try
to have a conversation
with Junior here.

477
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:28,500
Hey, how are ya? Okay?

478
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:30,000
Boy, you like them
cigarettes, don't ya?

479
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:32,266
- Yes.
- You got key for this?

480
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,333
Why did you try
to kill me today?

481
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,100
I thought you were Satan.

482
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,466
Uh, I'm sorry. Say that again.

483
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,966
I thought you were Satan.

484
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,033
But I'm stupid.

485
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:56,766
A man cannot kill Satan.

486
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,533
What about the shootings
at the cemetery?

487
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:05,000
[Jack]
Those guys are dead, Vassily.

488
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,733
Why'd you kill them? Did you
think they were Satan too?

489
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,900
I did not kill them.

490
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,400
More smoke, please?

491
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,100
Sure, have some smokes.

492
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:16,033
I can't give you the lighter,
that's against regulations.

493
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:18,633
So, Vassily, can you
say "hot seat"?

494
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,433
"Electric chair"? Hmm?

495
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:27,633
Three murders, Vassily.
Special circumstances.
Death penalty.

496
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,766
Shish kabob.

497
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
Not juvenile.

498
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,366
In Russia, maybe.

499
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,433
Here, never.

500
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,233
Juvenile, huh?

501
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:37,366
[Jack]
We've got three bodies.

502
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,166
We've got all kinds of evidence.
And we've got you.

503
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,066
I mean, even if you plead guilty
you're gonna get hammered.

504
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:44,566
I don't understand.

505
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,400
You'll do 20 to 25
years minimum.

506
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,166
M.. maybe I'm wrong.

507
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,833
[Jack]
Uh... maybe it was an accident.

508
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:53,300
The... the gun went off.

509
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,166
Uh, you sneezed or something.

510
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,566
Are we talking manslaughter
here, Vassily?

511
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,833
How much time for accident?

512
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,233
What you say, uh, man-slow...?

513
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,033
Manslaughter.

514
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,633
[Vassily]
Manslaughter.

515
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,666
Maybe five years.

516
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Okay, it was accident.

517
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:11,166
But not five years.

518
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
Six months, maybe.

519
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:17,766
Hey, you'll talk to the judge.
Maybe he'll see it your way.

520
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,600
Okay, so the...

521
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,266
the first shooting
was an accident.

522
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,400
What... what about the
other two killings?

523
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:25,600
Were they accidents too?

524
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:28,533
Yes. Yes, accident.

525
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,333
You a little grumpy in
the morning, Vassily?

526
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:35,366
Coffee nerves? What
was Sergei doing?

527
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,733
He do nothing.

528
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:38,200
He do nothing. He seen nothing.

529
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,533
Okay. Okay.

530
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,533
Why?

531
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,000
What?

532
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,733
These accidents.

533
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:56,900
You're standing there. You're
holding a shotgun on these guys.

534
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:59,666
Why? What was going on?

535
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:06,766
Accident. Juvenile.

536
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:17,600
[noises outside]

537
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,566
[doorknob turning]

538
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:43,733
[In Russian]
Help! Help! Fire! Fire!

539
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:44,966
[In Russian]
Help!

540
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,066
[In Russian]
Oh, my God! Fire!

541
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,066
[In Russian]
How could they do this?!
How could they do this?

542
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:57,900
It's okay. It's okay.

543
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:00,966
Thank you.
[baby crying]

544
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:04,166
Sasha! Sasha!

545
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,433
Mama! Mommy!

546
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,000
[wolf howl]

547
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:21,600
[In Russian]
Irina! Hold your
baby close, Irina.

548
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:25,066
We will come for you. Soon!

549
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:29,000
[wolf howling]

550
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,666
Go to sleep now, son.

551
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,300
[video game noises]

552
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,166
[Charles]
He's getting real good
with that computer.

553
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
[Mary Alice]
Yeah, well, I wish he
do something with it

554
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:39,966
besides play those stupid games.

555
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,733
[Charles]
Oh, you know, at least
he's learning to use it.

556
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,933
He's way ahead of me.
You pick up my tux?

557
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:47,300
[Sighs]
I'll do it tomorrow.

558
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,500
[Charles]
Well, now, don't forget.

559
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,633
You know, we want to leave
here around 6:30 or so.

560
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,700
Maybe we should just forget
about the banquet.

561
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,733
I could use a quiet
night at home.

562
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:57,233
What are you talking about?

563
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,400
You been looking forward
to this for months.

564
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,766
What about the new
dress you got?

565
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,233
I know but I've been
tired this week and...

566
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:08,033
What happened? Who called you?

567
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,766
Nerissa... and Roxanne.

568
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,100
Maybe I'll just call 'em back...

569
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,333
No, Charles, don't. They don't
understand the situation.

570
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:21,133
I think they understand it very
well if they're trying to get to
me through my wife.

571
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,433
That's not fair. These
people have been friends
of ours for years...

572
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:26,866
They're friends of Gordon
Thomas's too, which is why
they called...

573
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,333
[Mary Alice]
He was your friend too. You
named your son after him...

574
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,566
And I'm supposed to let his
son get away with murder!

575
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,733
Is that how it works?!

576
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,600
How can you say that to me?!

577
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:38,333
[Mary Alice]
These people are our oldest
and our closest friends

578
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:40,566
and they cannot understand
why you're so determined

579
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,666
to personally ruin
Gordon and his son!

580
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,066
If they, or anyone, thinks that
that's what's going here

581
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,966
then they don't
know me very well

582
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,600
and they're no
longer my friends.

583
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:55,233
Does that include me to?

584
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:59,233
I don't know. Does it?

585
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:12,933
[Charles]
Maybe you're right
about tomorrow.

586
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:16,233
We'll spend a quiet
evening at home.

587
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:21,066
[dramatic music]

588
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,133
[Horn honking]

589
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,633
[officer]
Put it back by the fence.

590
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,533
[driver]
All right.

591
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:10,800
[music gets more intense]

592
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,033
[car alarm blares]

593
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,333
What do ya think?

594
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,333
You're beautiful, baby.

595
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,500
[Charles]
Mmmm...

596
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,166
Oh, you smell good too.

597
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,466
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about last night...

598
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,066
No, I'm sorry.

599
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,433
I shouldn't have doubted you.

600
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:46,566
[Mary Alice]
Forgive me?

601
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,500
I don't know. Better
do that again.

602
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,033
[Charles]
Does, um...

603
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,300
does this mean, uh...

604
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,166
we're gonna go to
the dance tonight?

605
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,633
Yes, we're gonna go. We're
gonna drink champagne.

606
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,000
We're gonna dance
our booties off.

607
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:05,433
We'll be the happiest
people there.

608
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,933
Can I ask you something, baby?

609
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,500
What?

610
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,433
Do we gotta dance?

611
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,366
[phone rings]

612
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
Ah, damn.

613
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:19,733
What?

614
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:24,900
What?

615
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,100
[Fireman]
We have a pick-up here.

616
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:30,300
[Charles]
The fire started in
the middle of the lot?

617
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah, they used
Molotov cocktails.

618
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,566
The... the guard said he saw the
last one coming over the fence.

619
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,500
Why torch it now? I mean,
it's already been searched.

620
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:39,833
Maybe they didn't know that.

621
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,833
[officer]
Sergeant Reed...

622
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,866
[Jack]
Bicycles.

623
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,100
[Charles]
Yeah. Look at those
footprints. They're small.

624
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,166
[Eddie]
A woman, maybe?

625
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
[Charles]
Making that throw?

626
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:54,733
[Eddie]
Why not? She was wearing
combat boots, wasn't she?

627
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:57,533
[Jack]
Maybe it was a kid.

628
00:36:57,566 --> 00:36:59,033
[Eddie]
Wait a minute, Jack.
Those kids...

629
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,866
[Jack]
Yeah. The Bonewagon...

630
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
[Charles]
The Bonewagon?
What's the Bonewagon?

631
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,266
Hey, come back here
with that umbrella.

632
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,600
Yeah...

633
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,966
that's what they were
after, not Thomas's car.

634
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,233
Whose is it?

635
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,200
I think it's time we had another
talk with big brother, Sergei.

636
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:23,066
[Charles]
Big brother? What the hell's
going on around here?

637
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,033
[sound of kicking at door]

638
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,900
Told ya.

639
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,700
Waste of time.

640
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:46,533
[Hanlan]
He's laughing at you, Reed.

641
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:49,700
He's in, uh, y'know, Brighton
Beach, driving a limo

642
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,233
and he's laughing his ass off.

643
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:53,233
[phone ringing]

644
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,266
[game show announcer]
Get a good spin, Doug.

645
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,200
Eggplant! Beautiful!

646
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,200
[phone continues]

647
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,333
The phone, idiot!

648
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,866
[in Russian]
Turn it down.

649
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,333
[phone continues]

650
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:14,200
Hello?

651
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:16,633
[Vassily]
Sergei. Thank God.

652
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:18,133
I am waiting long time.

653
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:21,433
[Sergei on phone]
Vassily, poor boy,
are you all right?

654
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,833
Sergei, you must come.
[prisoners shouting to
get off the phone]

655
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:24,900
You must help me, I'm afraid.

656
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,800
They put me here
in terrible place.

657
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:30,100
You must tell them you
are juvenile, Vassily.
All will be better.

658
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,533
I tell them but
they don't listen.
[prisoners continue yelling]

659
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,633
They put me here with
terrible people.

660
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,900
- [Sergei] I cannot help you,
Vassily.

661
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:40,566
You have sinned, and only
God can help you now. You
must pray, little brother.

662
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,500
- [prisoners keep yelling]
- [Sergei] Pray hard.

663
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,000
[prisoner]
Tell her you love
her and let's go!

664
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,700
- Sergei!
- [prisoner] Move it! Hey!

665
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,366
- Sergei!
- C'mon, get off!

666
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,333
Sergei!

667
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,233
[Sergei]
Ah, payday. Who's first?

668
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:00,266
Mikhail's Bakery,
two hundred dollars.

669
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,266
A generous man, Mikhail.

670
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,266
Georgi's restaurant, $250.

671
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,833
Should be 300 but
I'll talk to him.

672
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:10,733
What about Brodsky, the jeweler?

673
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:14,466
Um, Brodsky... he says,
sir, his wife is sick.

674
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,066
How much?

675
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,366
Nothing. It's true. She is sick.

676
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,633
His wife has been sick since the
storming of the Winter Palace.

677
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:29,666
Now come on, we are wolves, not
sheep! You two, come here!

678
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:35,400
Go to Brodsky's. Break
the big window.

679
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,366
He'll run out with the money.

680
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,300
Tell him there's a
late charge, mmm, 500.

681
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:44,300
If he squeals, go inside,
get his wife's wheelchair,
bring it here.

682
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,433
What if she's in it?

683
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,533
I don't want her,
just the chair. Go.

684
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:49,466
He'll pay. Go.

685
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,133
You three..

686
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,833
go and see the little bitch
with a big mouth, hmm?

687
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:56,766
I want her terrified.
Do you understand?

688
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,866
I want her wetting
her pants! Go.

689
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,966
Ahhh...

690
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,333
[in Russian]
Watching that junk. Fool...

691
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,566
[wolves howling]

692
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:25,666
Irina, open the door!

693
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,333
We have come to babysit! Irina!

694
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,833
Bitch! Hey, bitch, open the
door! I'll kill you Bitch!

695
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:45,966
Open the door!

696
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:53,533
Don't hurt me.
Please...don't hurt me.

697
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,666
[Jack]
I hate floaters.

698
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,433
[Eddie]
Yeah, so do I. But
that's a fresh one.

699
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:04,500
[Jack]
Well I guess it wasn't
a swimming accident.

700
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:07,466
[Eddie]
Not with his head
caved in like that.

701
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,166
Technician said there's a
shotgun wound to the back.

702
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,100
[Jack]
This is the stuff from
his pockets, huh?

703
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:15,366
Gimme a... lemme borrow a pen
or a pencil or something.

704
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,033
[Jack]
Well, that's really interesting.

705
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,700
What?

706
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:26,133
He's Russian.

707
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:29,300
Look, I gotta find out
what we're dealing with
here in this precinct.

708
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,066
How many people are missing?

709
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,233
How many investigations,
if any, were carried out?

710
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:37,566
Well, you're gonna need the
Precinct Incident Report File

711
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,866
the Investigation File,
and the Complaint File.

712
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,133
Forget about it.

713
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,633
Maybe I can shake
things up a little bit.

714
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:47,466
Meantime, why don't you see if
you can find me Irina Lebed.

715
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,800
Who?

716
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:52,800
That little firecracker
who gave us Gulov. I wanna
talk to her.

717
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,133
Now, what do you mean
by "shake things up?"

718
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,200
You really wanna know, Eddie?

719
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,533
Nah, I don't think so.

720
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:03,433
[Charles]
Good mornin', Pete.

721
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:08,633
[Myers]
No calls, Sergeant. No one
opens this door, understood?

722
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,766
Gentlemen...

723
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,433
what a nice surprise.
You want some coffee?

724
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:23,100
Cut the crap. Let's
get down to business.

725
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:26,000
I'd like some tea, Lieutenant.

726
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:28,933
Billy, a cup of tea for Mr.
Miller here. Thank you.

727
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:30,133
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

728
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:32,166
Pete.

729
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,233
[Miller]
Lieutenant Silvera

730
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:35,700
we're anxious to resolve
this unfortunate situation

731
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:38,666
and we'd like to count
on your cooperation.

732
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,733
Well I haven't read the
papers today, Mr. Miller.

733
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,533
You win an election in
the last 24 hours or so?

734
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:44,766
[Charles]
Am I working for you now?

735
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,066
Listen... the games are over.

736
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,433
You understand?

737
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,166
Well last time I looked,
you weren't Civil Service
either, Pete.

738
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,166
[knocking on door]

739
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:19,733
[Charles]
You don't need my permission to
take over this investigation.

740
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:22,966
Sober up the D.A. long
enough to get his signature,
it's a done deal.

741
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,866
We're not going to move the
investigation to the D.A.'s
office, Lieutenant.

742
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,333
It's too late for that.

743
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:28,466
Too late?

744
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,566
The kid won't go to trial
for another six months...

745
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,633
In six months the
campaign bleeds to death.

746
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:36,800
We need this over
and done with, now.

747
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,066
In two day's time,
you will announce

748
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,633
that all charges against Gordon
Thomas, Jr. are being dropped.

749
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:47,400
What's going on, Miller?

750
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:49,866
I gotta make some calls.

751
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:58,166
The two investigating officers,
Carini and Cartwright

752
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,566
deliberately manipulated
the circumstances of this
tragic accident

753
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,833
to cause charges to be brought
against Gordon Thomas, Jr.

754
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:06,333
They lied.

755
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:08,100
They suborned
witnesses to perjury.

756
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,966
They fabricated evidence.

757
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,333
Have you gone completely
crazy, Miller?

758
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:14,233
We have affidavits from
a score of witnesses

759
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:17,133
including one of the
patrolmen on the scene.

760
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,866
[Miller]
We have a detailed statement
from one Rafael Rodriquez

761
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,366
the victim's husband.

762
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,033
It must've been expensive.

763
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:29,000
What make you think I'm
gonna go along with this?

764
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,433
You'll go along, Lieutenant

765
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:34,233
or you'll go down with them.

766
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:37,300
[Miller]
We have witnesses and affidavits
implicating you too.

767
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,466
And make no mistake, Lieutenant

768
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,666
we won't hesitate to use them.

769
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,500
You have 48 hours
to think about it.

770
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,433
Gordon know about this?

771
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:54,100
Gordon's a politician.

772
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:56,133
He knows what he wants to know.

773
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,800
You surprise me, Sandy.

774
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:03,000
Pete Myers... hell, Pete's got
the conscience of a lizard.

775
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,833
But Sandy Miller...

776
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:07,233
I've watched you all my life.

777
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:10,833
Birmingham, Selma, Little Rock
all those righteous years...

778
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:13,200
Forty years, Lieutenant.

779
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,533
[Miller]
It was a lot simpler then.

780
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:21,566
It was terrifying and majestic,
but pure and simple.

781
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:25,833
Now it's no longer simple
and it certainly isn't pure.

782
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,233
And we're running out of time.

783
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:32,533
Gordon Thomas may be the last
chance we have to put this
nightmare of race behind us.

784
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,600
And it's unfair, yes.
And you are the victims

785
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,466
you and your two
detective friends.

786
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,233
And I'm sorry about that.

787
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:42,000
But there have been many
victims over the years,
millions of them.

788
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,333
And if I'm right about Gordon

789
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:49,000
maybe you and your
friends will be the last.

790
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,600
[in Russian]
This is your father, angel.

791
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:02,533
Remember your sweet
father... always.

792
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,133
[knocking on door]

793
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:25,200
[knocking on door]

794
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:36,200
[Eddie]
Police...

795
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:39,533
I'm, uh, Sergeant Dirksen.

796
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:40,700
Remember me from the church?

797
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:42,133
Yeah. Yeah...

798
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,533
Always interesting knocking
on doors around here.

799
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:47,833
I'm sorry. Come in.

800
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,733
Yeah, come...

801
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,066
[Irina]
We knew it would be hard

802
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,933
but, at least here

803
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,200
there could be hope.

804
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:27,066
And for her...

805
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:30,066
and for her there would be more.

806
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:33,600
My husband, he was, uh...

807
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:37,300
intelligent, um...a professor.

808
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,333
And he was digging graves.

809
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:41,966
He hated the cemetery,
of course.

810
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,133
This is no job for him.

811
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:46,933
And now he's dead.

812
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,733
And now even hope is gone and...

813
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,133
I don't live for myself.
I care nothing for myself.

814
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:55,900
Only for her.
Only for her.

815
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:57,800
Tell us about Sergei.

816
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,666
He is a jackal.

817
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:03,133
When we come here

818
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,633
each of us

819
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,366
we have something.

820
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,200
[Irina]
Some money or some...
gold, diamonds.

821
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:12,266
Antiques. You understand?

822
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,766
Because you cannot start
over with nothing. You
need something.

823
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,366
And Sergei, he
finds the new ones.

824
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,000
And he watches them.

825
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,866
And he talks to them.

826
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,700
And one day, they are no more.

827
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,766
They are gone.

828
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,633
And we go to the police
and the police laugh.

829
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,300
They say... they say, uh

830
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:35,433
your son is in Miami, your
brother is in San Diego.

831
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:37,600
[dramatic music]
[Irina] They... they
are not dead.

832
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:40,633
They have taken the money and
run away. But this is not true.

833
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,300
But they will not listen.

834
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,200
- No one will listen, until you.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

835
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:48,900
Wait wait wait--why would
there be flies in an
empty grave, Eddie?

836
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:51,300
- What?
- Because the grave isn't empty.

837
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,766
The flies, the Bonewagon

838
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,066
the 'half-time' job at the
cemetery, the flies...

839
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,466
What are you talking
about, Jack?

840
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,966
Of course they're not in San
Diego or Miami, they're here.

841
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,566
They're here in Pleasant
Creek Cemetery.

842
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,866
He buried them in a cemetery

843
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,366
probably underneath the
legitimate graves.

844
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,400
That's why he shotgunned
the cemetery workers,
because he got caught.

845
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,666
[Jack]
That's why your husband
is dead, Mrs. Lebed.

846
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:16,900
Because that's where
the bodies are.

847
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:22,700
[singing in Russian]

848
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,466
He needs a doctor, Sergei.

849
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,333
Doctors ask questions.

850
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:50,900
He can see, can't he?

851
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:52,733
[Sergei]
Baba Yelena, she got
magic in her hands.

852
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:54,633
He'll be as good as
new in a few days.

853
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,633
[phone ringing]

854
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,333
It's Vassily.

855
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:11,566
- Hang up.
- But, Sergei--

856
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,700
I said hang up!

857
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:17,733
There is no Vassily!
Vassily is finished!
You understand?

858
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,100
You go back. Watch the
building. When she returns,
I will finish her myself.

859
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,800
And you, my frightened
little duck

860
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,366
you can take care of the baby.

861
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,366
[radio announcer #1]
They're just pounding the
boards today here in Tampa.

862
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,933
Parker gets maximum height
on the jump shot.

863
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,633
He's listed at 6'10"
and he's got--

864
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,500
[announcer #2]
Yeah, but he's about 6'8",
Dom. We know that.

865
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:41,266
[announcer #1]
Maybe 6'9". He's been all
over the defense today

866
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,233
both on offense and defense.
He's on the verge of another
double-double.

867
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:48,666
[Jack]
So this cop goes to a
doctor and he says, uh

868
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,733
"Doctor, every time I talk to a
newspaper reporter, I get a
headache. Why is that?"

869
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:57,100
[Russell]
And the Doctor says, 'It's
probably the hangovers.'

870
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:00,166
You heard it, huh?

871
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,233
How you doin', Jack?

872
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,766
[Jack]
How you doin', Russell?
Good to see you.

873
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,266
Thanks for coming.

874
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,566
[Russell]
So tell me, you ever
make Lieutenant?

875
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,366
Hell, they're still trying
to make am a civilian.

876
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,200
Hey, I've been reading that
stuff that you've been doing
on the Garbage Wars.

877
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:14,800
That's really great work.

878
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:16,833
Y'know, I always knew that
alderman was bent.

879
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:20,033
The dope put the bribe
money in a mutual fund.

880
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:21,733
I'll tell ya, Jack

881
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:24,533
if the politicians in this
town ever get smart we're
gonna be in some real trouble.

882
00:51:24,566 --> 00:51:27,733
Russell, that's probably
one thing we don't have
to worry about.

883
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,900
I got a great story for you.

884
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:33,666
It's got everything in it:
struggling immigrants

885
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,633
teenage gangs, vicious murders

886
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:39,866
and a local police unit that
just ignores the whole mess.

887
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,400
I need it right away.

888
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,533
Declaring war on the
brass again, Jack?

889
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:46,466
Nah... more like a sneak attack.

890
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:50,733
Well, you've never
let me down yet.

891
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,966
So tell me, Jack, what
do you get out of this?

892
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:00,033
Not a promotion,
that's for sure.

893
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,966
[Nerissa]
I'm really glad you both came.

894
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,600
I think you're so brave.

895
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:11,133
[Mary Alice]
While I'm glad you're
glad, Nerissa.

896
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:12,400
But why wouldn't we come?

897
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:15,566
I mean, with Gordon speaking
tonight. You know...

898
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,766
We've known going for years,
haven't we, Charles?

899
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,200
Oh, sure. You know, in the
old days, we served
together, Nerissa.

900
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,833
I was his tail gunner.

901
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:25,066
I didn't know Gordon
was in the Air Force.

902
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,566
He wasn't.

903
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,800
If you'll excuse us, I'm
gonna dance with my wife.

904
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,933
[Miller]
Lieutenant, if I may presume

905
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:36,233
I like to dance with the
most beautiful woman in
the room tonight.

906
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:39,033
Mary Alice, Sandy Miller.

907
00:52:39,066 --> 00:52:41,533
Mr. Miller, my wife Mary Alice.

908
00:52:41,566 --> 00:52:42,800
Pleasure to meet you.

909
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:46,433
If you will do me
the honor, my dear.

910
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:49,933
Lieutenant Silvera.

911
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:52,700
My father was wondering if
you have a few minutes.

912
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:56,600
Excuse me, Nerissa, folks.

913
00:52:57,366 --> 00:53:00,966
[Roxanne]
Close your mouth, Nerissa,
before something jumps in there.

914
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,933
So, how you doing, Gordon?

915
00:53:03,966 --> 00:53:05,666
I am all right, Lieutenant.

916
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,800
I'm not scared anymore, either.

917
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:12,333
Will that's too bad
'cause Isabella Rodriguez
is still dead.

918
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,966
Did you know they work
together on a garbage truck?

919
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,933
You're kidding.

920
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:16,933
No, it's true.

921
00:53:16,966 --> 00:53:20,166
Gordon drove and Charles
handled the trash.

922
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,866
He was Gordon's tail
gunner, he said.

923
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,266
So this is something I have
to show up for, yes?

924
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,466
No... Friday night?

925
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,933
The Palm. 8 o'clock.

926
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:37,666
See you then.

927
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:41,466
Charles, I was afraid that
you wouldn't show up.

928
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,400
Why wouldn't I show up, Gordon?

929
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:45,066
Junior, could you give us
a few minutes, please?

930
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,666
Oh, let him stay. I mean, this
is all about him, isn't it?

931
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,900
I don't want him to stay.

932
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:52,900
Junior, could you please give
me some club soda? Charles?

933
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:57,100
Champagne. Better make a bottle.

934
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,133
Sit down.

935
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,466
Thank you.

936
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:09,233
[Miller]
Whatever happened between them?

937
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:12,500
Willy Bradford, a poor,
black boy, stole a car

938
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:14,800
and the cops shot
him and killed him.

939
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,833
It was a bad shooting,
Charles said.

940
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:19,033
The cop was in a lot of trouble.

941
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:22,966
But it was an election year,
and Gordon made some speeches
that were...

942
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,200
...Inflammatory.

943
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:26,966
Charles thought they were.

944
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,700
A week or so later the cop who
shot the boy killed himself.

945
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,500
Charles and Gordon were
never the same after that.

946
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,666
This is a bunch of
lies and you know it!

947
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,466
You don't think it's possible
that the police could do

948
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,466
what they did to my son,
and me?! What country have
you been living in?!

949
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh, cut the crap, Gordon!

950
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:45,666
Randy Cartwright is a decent,
hard-working black man come
from nothing!

951
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,100
Just like you! And me! He made
detective in eight years.

952
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:51,500
Goes to law school nights!
He's got two kids!

953
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:54,266
You think he's going to throw it
all away because he don't want
you to be Mayor?!

954
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,433
Well, we have the affidavits
and the witnesses.

955
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:59,233
The media, and most of the
people, are gonna be on my side!

956
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:01,966
Well, I won't! I'm gonna
fight you on this, Gordon--

957
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,933
Yeah, well we're gonna roll
all over you, Charles!

958
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:10,766
Then you roll on! I'm gonna
go dance with my wife.

959
00:55:13,766 --> 00:55:16,033
Is this what it was
all about, Gordon?

960
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,966
Is this where we wanted to get,
so we could be just like them?

961
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,900
Getting and having?
Taking care of number one?

962
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:24,966
Screwing or being screwed?!

963
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:30,366
What ever made you think that
we were better than them?

964
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,200
Dad, you're drinking.

965
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,200
Yeah, I'm drinking. I've got
a bad taste in my mouth.

966
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:53,833
You wipe that smile
off your face.

967
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:55,766
You think this is funny?!

968
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,300
That man is the best
friend I ever had

969
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,933
the most honest man I know.

970
00:55:59,966 --> 00:56:04,866
And I have to destroy him
to save your sorry ass!

971
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,633
'Course it has absolutely
nothing to do with saving
your sorry ass, right, Dad?

972
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:15,033
Don't you ever talk to
me like that again.

973
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:19,133
Don't you understand?

974
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:22,266
This is the American dream, Dad.

975
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,733
You.. you work hard.
You make sacrifices.

976
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:30,366
You save money, so your kids can
go crazy and destroy themselves!

977
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,500
Well, congratulations,
Dad, you've made it!

978
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:58,833
[fast paced music]

979
00:57:30,266 --> 00:57:32,033
[Miller]
10 years.

980
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,066
10 years...

981
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,700
working full-time days

982
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:40,100
and going to college and
law school at night.

983
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:43,666
I learned just this evening
that one of Gordon's day jobs

984
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,200
was driving a garbage truck.

985
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:48,466
After years of
struggle, graduation

986
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,866
admission to the bar, then what?

987
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,333
A fat job with a
fat paycheck? No.

988
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:57,933
Because by then there had
been Selma, and Little Rock

989
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:00,866
four little girls
murdered in Alabama

990
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,900
the Rev. King dead in Memphis.

991
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,000
There was destiny then

992
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:08,033
and duty

993
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:10,800
for Gordon Thomas.

994
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,300
You're sure she's alone?

995
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,033
I saw them go.

996
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:25,766
Except for him.

997
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:28,866
Okay.

998
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,533
You remember what
I told you, huh?

999
00:58:30,566 --> 00:58:33,100
Lots of noise. Go.

1000
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,200
Give it to me.

1001
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:46,766
No I want her looking
at me when I do it.

1002
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,333
Right into my eyes.

1003
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:53,833
[glass breaks
car alarm blares]

1004
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,466
Let's go.

1005
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:02,866
[Gordon Sr.]
We have come a long way.

1006
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,566
Just take a look around
you tonight to see

1007
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,566
how far we've come.

1008
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:11,766
Some of us.

1009
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,933
Because too many,
black and white

1010
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,633
have been left behind.

1011
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:22,200
That is a problem that
America faces now.

1012
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:25,066
Not who will sit in
the front of the bus

1013
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,600
and who will sit in
the back of the bus

1014
00:59:27,633 --> 00:59:31,766
but how many will be able
to ride in the bus at all.

1015
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,066
How many, black and white,
will be defeated by poverty

1016
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,866
ignorance, and yes, racism

1017
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,600
and the greatest, most
dangerous enemy of them all...

1018
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,100
Hopelessness.

1019
00:59:48,366 --> 00:59:50,500
[horns honking]

1020
01:00:07,366 --> 01:00:08,600
[in Russian]
Stand back.

1021
01:00:15,066 --> 01:00:16,966
Find her.

1022
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:25,900
Hi, Sergei.

1023
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:33,866
[Jack]
Put the gun down.

1024
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,066
You fooled me.

1025
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,266
You fooled Sergei.

1026
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:02,133
Eddie!

1027
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,466
He's on the third floor
and he's got a hostage.

1028
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:16,966
[woman screams]

1029
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,700
[gun clicks but it is
out of ammunition]

1030
01:01:30,066 --> 01:01:31,700
He's on the roof.

1031
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:51,400
[Sergei]
Shhhh...

1032
01:01:52,466 --> 01:01:54,766
[man speaks in Russian]

1033
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:13,900
For you, eh. A gift.

1034
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:16,200
Now, tell me.

1035
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,133
When you sleep

1036
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:20,133
do you wear pajamas?

1037
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,633
Yeah, he's on the roof.

1038
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,900
No, were trying to get
everybody out now.

1039
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:25,466
C'mon...

1040
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:28,166
[Jack]
It's pitch black up there.
I can't see a thing.

1041
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,933
[Eddie]
Well, he can't go any
place, unless he can fly.

1042
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:31,500
Well, then let's SWAT
team take care of it.

1043
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:32,700
I'm not going to do
anything about it--

1044
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:33,700
Right this way, ladies.

1045
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,033
- C'mon, right this way.
- Keep moving. Come on.

1046
01:02:35,066 --> 01:02:36,266
- How are you doing?
- It's OK.

1047
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,100
I can't even feel it.
Did you get him?

1048
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,900
[Jack]
No, we didn't get
him, but we will.

1049
01:02:39,933 --> 01:02:42,533
It's all right, don't worry
about it. You take it easy. Just
take the rest of the night off.

1050
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:44,600
You did a hell of
a job, all right?

1051
01:02:44,633 --> 01:02:47,100
[Gordon Sr.]
So what it comes down to...

1052
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:50,600
what it always comes down to

1053
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:55,200
is good and evil.

1054
01:02:55,833 --> 01:03:00,433
Now I know it's not
politically correct to talk
in terms of good and evil.

1055
01:03:00,466 --> 01:03:03,566
To denounce the slippery
slope of moral relativism

1056
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,166
we find ourselves so
perilously clinging to.

1057
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,366
But I do denounce it.

1058
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,366
There is a difference
between good and evil

1059
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,666
and we must begin to
choose good again.

1060
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,966
[crowd murmurs]

1061
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:43,900
Good...

1062
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:48,533
And evil.

1063
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:54,133
I am reminded of an old
union slogan from the 30s

1064
01:03:55,166 --> 01:04:00,433
"Which side are you on?"

1065
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:07,033
Which side are you on?

1066
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,766
- [Arlene] Jack?
- [Jack] Yeah, um, Arlene

1067
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,633
I--I'm sorry, uh,
we didn't call.

1068
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,766
This is, uh--this
is Irina Lebed.

1069
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,133
This is Sasha. She's got a
bit of a problem tonight...

1070
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,966
Oh, you poor things.
Eddie, take them upstairs
to the guest room.

1071
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,700
There are clean towels up in the
closet. Go ahead. Go with Eddie.

1072
01:04:42,733 --> 01:04:44,466
Y' know, I'll be up in
a second with some tea.

1073
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,200
You can take a nice warm bath,
and I'll watch the baby.

1074
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm sorry, Jack.
What were you saying?

1075
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,500
[Arlene]
Is she smiling at you?

1076
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:57,633
- [baby laughing]
- [John Jr.] Look at you.

1077
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:58,866
-[Arlene] Don't give her that...
- [John Jr.] Cute baby...

1078
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,566
- [Arlene] She can't eat that.
- [Eddie] Why not?

1079
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,100
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1080
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:08,833
Well, well, well, Eddie.
You been here all night?

1081
01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:09,966
[Eddie]
No, I've been home.

1082
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,700
I, uh, came back to talk
to you about Sergei.

1083
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:14,133
Oh, yeah. What about Sergei?

1084
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,100
He got away.

1085
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,533
- [John Jr. talking to baby]
- [Jack] Yeah.

1086
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:19,133
[Jack]
You could've told me that on
the phone. What's going on?

1087
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,300
- Jack?
- Huh? What?

1088
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,500
- Come here.
- What?

1089
01:05:22,533 --> 01:05:24,000
What, what, what?

1090
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:28,766
Eddie is here because he's
concerned about Irina and
the baby, alright?

1091
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,033
[Jack]
Concerned? What--?

1092
01:05:30,066 --> 01:05:32,366
Sympathetic, okay?

1093
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,966
Okay. Okay...

1094
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,033
Diapers are in the garbage and
the garbage has been put out.

1095
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,066
[John Jr.]
Speaking of diapers. Mom...

1096
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,666
Honey, let me walk
you through that.

1097
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,233
- Eccch..
- I, uh, just remembered

1098
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:46,866
there is something I want
to talk to you about, Jack.

1099
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,166
- What?
- [Eddie] Exhumation.

1100
01:05:51,933 --> 01:05:53,366
You came over here at seven
o'clock in the morning

1101
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,600
wearing a shirt and tie

1102
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:57,533
and wearing cologne,
if I'm not mistaken

1103
01:05:57,566 --> 01:06:01,166
because you wanted to talk about
exhuming bodies, right, Eddie?

1104
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,733
Yeah, that was one
of the reasons.

1105
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:06,166
It's hard enough to get an
exhumation order under
normal circumstances.

1106
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,866
"Your Honor, we really don't
want to look at the body.

1107
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,600
we wanna see if there's anything
buried underneath it."

1108
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,400
Eh, forget about it.

1109
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:14,133
No, I think I'm gonna
go pay a visit to

1110
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:15,400
little brother Vassily.

1111
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:17,566
He's been sitting down
there in maximum security

1112
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,666
in the county jail
for a couple of days.

1113
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,700
his back pressed firmly
against the wall.

1114
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:25,033
Maybe he's looking at things
a little differently.

1115
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:26,000
Coffee?

1116
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:28,633
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah, please.

1117
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:30,433
[Jack]
Thank you, my dear.

1118
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,166
[Eddie]
They're, uh, holding
the, uh, kids....

1119
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,333
the "Wolves"...

1120
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:35,433
at the, uh, detention center.

1121
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:37,633
I suppose I should go down
there and talk to 'em.

1122
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,600
Let 'em go.

1123
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,166
What, are you crazy?

1124
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,433
I wanna try something.

1125
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,166
Get their names and addresses,
and their fingerprints

1126
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,733
and let 'em go.

1127
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:47,366
We got a wounded cop, Jack.

1128
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,433
It might not be that easy.

1129
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:52,233
Nah, you can do it, Eddie.
Just wear that cologne.

1130
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:08,533
[Jack]
So how do you like maximum
security, Vassily?

1131
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,900
Terrible.

1132
01:07:09,933 --> 01:07:12,333
Terrible people, even guards.

1133
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:14,866
Ah, the guards have gotta be
tough to work in this place.

1134
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,000
Hmmm?

1135
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:17,966
[Jack]
What kind of a deal are
they talking about?

1136
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,433
Seventy-five years.

1137
01:07:19,466 --> 01:07:22,800
Hmmm. Well, you'll do thirty.

1138
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,933
That's not generous,
but it's not terrible.

1139
01:07:24,966 --> 01:07:27,500
Y'know, you... you plead
guilty to three murders.

1140
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:29,933
I murdered no one.

1141
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:31,900
Sergei tell me to plea.

1142
01:07:31,933 --> 01:07:35,166
He tell me to say I am
juvenile so I get out soon.

1143
01:07:35,933 --> 01:07:37,333
What's he say now?

1144
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:39,466
He not come.

1145
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,133
He not come once.

1146
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:43,133
He don't even talk
to me on the phone.

1147
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:46,433
I'm shocked by that.
I'm truly shocked.

1148
01:07:46,466 --> 01:07:51,000
Sergei lied to you. He's not
gonna help you but I will.

1149
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:53,066
First, you gotta help me.

1150
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,066
C'mon now, Vassily,
you gotta get smart.

1151
01:07:57,433 --> 01:08:00,366
I am not smart.

1152
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,233
I am stupid.

1153
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:05,000
In old country...

1154
01:08:05,033 --> 01:08:08,433
they put me in place
for stupid people...

1155
01:08:08,466 --> 01:08:10,500
crazy people.

1156
01:08:10,533 --> 01:08:13,000
Terrible place.

1157
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:16,000
Worse that this one.

1158
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:20,433
But Sergei, he come
and take me out.

1159
01:08:20,466 --> 01:08:23,266
He bring me here, to America.

1160
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,666
He take care of me.
He protect me.

1161
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,133
What... what are you saying,
that Sergei is a good man?

1162
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:31,933
No.

1163
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:34,166
He cheat.

1164
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,966
He steal.

1165
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,933
He kill people...

1166
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:42,366
not just for money

1167
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,766
but because he
likes to kill them.

1168
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:49,166
Then he makes me shoot them

1169
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,633
or hit them, after
they are dead.

1170
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:56,166
Misha Sorenski.

1171
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,733
Yuri Brodski.

1172
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,133
Nikita Bulgov.

1173
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:08,100
I see them always.

1174
01:09:08,133 --> 01:09:13,733
Yeah, I let Sergei fool me too.

1175
01:09:14,966 --> 01:09:17,400
But I'll help you, Vassily.

1176
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:18,866
I swear to you, I'll help you.

1177
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,433
No...

1178
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:24,833
no one can help Vassily now.

1179
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,466
Maybe cigarettes.

1180
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,033
You get me good cigarettes?

1181
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,466
Unfiltered, yes?

1182
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,266
Yeah, I'll get you
cigarettes. You gotta
smoke these first, right?

1183
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,466
Alright...

1184
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,233
tell me where the bodies are.

1185
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:51,666
[dogs barking]
[dramatic music]

1186
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,633
Baba!

1187
01:09:57,133 --> 01:09:58,966
Baba!

1188
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:01,800
[dogs barking]

1189
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:04,200
Old woman!

1190
01:10:06,933 --> 01:10:08,933
Baba!

1191
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:18,133
My guns! Where are my guns?!?

1192
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,766
So you have returned, finally.
Where have you been?

1193
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:40,300
The Old Ones have gone.
They have take the guns.
We must find them. Go.

1194
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:46,866
It wasn't me. It was the police.

1195
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,900
It was you, Sergei.

1196
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:52,500
His leg is shattered.
He's crippled.

1197
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,600
I had to get away.
I had to shoot.

1198
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:02,733
[Sergei]
What are you doing?

1199
01:11:06,633 --> 01:11:08,666
Where are you going?

1200
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:10,200
Come back, I have no money.

1201
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:13,233
I... I have no guns.
I have no shoes!

1202
01:11:13,266 --> 01:11:15,233
Come back!

1203
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,800
Yuri Brodsky.

1204
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,800
Misha Sorenski.

1205
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,933
-Is that it?
- I don't know.

1206
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,900
Some we do it at night.
Some we do in the morning.

1207
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:42,500
It... when it's dark.

1208
01:11:42,533 --> 01:11:44,600
One or two, maybe.

1209
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,533
Jack!

1210
01:11:46,566 --> 01:11:47,633
[Eddie]
Yeah, okay.

1211
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:49,800
Alright. Thanks.

1212
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:52,266
They got Sergei holed
up, you were right.

1213
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,533
The Little Wolves turned him in.

1214
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:59,933
[dramatic music]

1215
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,533
Hi, Sergei.

1216
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,900
[Jack]
What, you wanna
make a run for it?

1217
01:12:31,933 --> 01:12:33,233
Hmm?

1218
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:38,800
Go ahead. Please...

1219
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,600
I want you to.

1220
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:56,600
Cuff him.

1221
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:07,900
Can we get started, please?

1222
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:11,766
I don't want to miss my ten
o'clock baloney sandwich.

1223
01:13:30,233 --> 01:13:31,400
How about a drink?

1224
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:34,200
Yes. Vodka. A double.

1225
01:13:34,233 --> 01:13:36,600
A root beer.

1226
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,666
[Jack]
I saw your brother yesterday.

1227
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,400
Half-brother.

1228
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,666
You could get him off the hook.

1229
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:48,566
As you Americans say,
what's in it for me?

1230
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,666
My sentence reduced from, uh

1231
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,300
three hundred to
two hundred years?

1232
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:54,600
He's your brother.

1233
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:56,700
[Sergei]
Half-brother.

1234
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,866
Half-wit.

1235
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,400
I saved him once and
brought him here.

1236
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,900
It was a moment of
weakness for me

1237
01:14:02,933 --> 01:14:04,866
and a total disaster
for both of us.

1238
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:09,000
No, Vassily needs a
structured environment.

1239
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:11,033
Besides...

1240
01:14:11,066 --> 01:14:13,466
I like the idea of you
feeling guilty about him

1241
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,333
for the next twenty
or thirty years.

1242
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:19,266
What happened to your accent?

1243
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,133
I still have an accent.

1244
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,700
It's not the same.

1245
01:14:22,733 --> 01:14:27,333
Oh, what a detective.

1246
01:14:27,366 --> 01:14:30,300
[Sergei]
I speak better English
than you do, Sergeant.

1247
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,800
Which is not saying much, I know

1248
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:35,666
because I probably studied
it longer that you did,
when I was in the Army.

1249
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,266
When there was an Army.

1250
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,400
That's right, nearly Cold
War was lost, you know.

1251
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:45,166
Everyone was so desperate
to study English.

1252
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,733
Oh, the Great Detective
is perplexed, hmm?

1253
01:14:48,766 --> 01:14:50,866
Who is this person?

1254
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,366
Obviously he's intelligent
and well-educated.

1255
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,066
Why would he commit such
loathsome crimes?

1256
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,566
Okay. Why?

1257
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,333
Why not?

1258
01:15:10,933 --> 01:15:17,133
[Sergei]
Oh... the good policeman frowns
at the evil outlaw, huh?

1259
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:20,033
What do you want me
to do, beg for mercy?

1260
01:15:20,066 --> 01:15:21,533
Tremble beneath the

1261
01:15:21,566 --> 01:15:23,066
- [men walk in talking]
- [Sergei] majesty of your law.

1262
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:28,400
- Shut the door. And be quiet.
- [Sergei] What hypocrisy.

1263
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:33,200
An American lives
in a huge house.

1264
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:36,400
Thirty people could like in this
house comfortably, yet...

1265
01:15:36,433 --> 01:15:38,066
he's alone.

1266
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:41,333
He has, uh, three cars...

1267
01:15:41,366 --> 01:15:44,400
four bedrooms, six televisions.

1268
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,300
They sit and gather dust.

1269
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,366
Another American, a
block from here...

1270
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,566
lives in a cardboard box.

1271
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:58,533
Flea-bitten, and
starving, he breaks in...

1272
01:15:58,566 --> 01:16:04,166
to the huge house and steals one
of the unused televisions.

1273
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,700
He is arrested and punished

1274
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:11,533
by you, Detective.

1275
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,366
So, who is criminal?

1276
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,033
The rich man, the poor thief...

1277
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:24,200
or you?

1278
01:16:24,866 --> 01:16:28,800
This is your society, your law.

1279
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:29,966
Congratulations.

1280
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,966
[Jack]
What a bunch of crap.

1281
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:38,000
You... you preyed on
these people yourself.

1282
01:16:38,033 --> 01:16:41,800
Poor immigrants, women,
children, defenseless people--

1283
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,700
Of course, because
they are defenseless.

1284
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:46,000
Because you do not defend them.

1285
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:48,833
I'm not a Marxist, Sergeant.

1286
01:16:48,866 --> 01:16:50,966
I'm a Darwinist.

1287
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,200
A predator.

1288
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,866
A wolf, if you will.

1289
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:58,166
I do not accept your
society or its rules.

1290
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,433
So I am outlaw.

1291
01:17:00,466 --> 01:17:03,333
And I choose to be outlaw.

1292
01:17:03,366 --> 01:17:07,933
Ahhh. A Darwinist.

1293
01:17:07,966 --> 01:17:09,833
[Jack]
A wolf.

1294
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:15,400
Hmmm. Tell me something, Sergei.

1295
01:17:15,433 --> 01:17:18,800
Does a wolf take
pleasure in killing?

1296
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:19,933
What?

1297
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:21,900
Vassily said that you kill
because you like to kill.

1298
01:17:21,933 --> 01:17:25,166
Does... does a
wolf like to kill?

1299
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,700
Oh... not just wolves.

1300
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:39,966
Shall I tell you, what
joy really is, Sergeant?

1301
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:46,733
[Sergei]
It's looking into their eyes,
right before the end.

1302
01:17:46,766 --> 01:17:50,333
They've given up all their
pathetic little treasures.

1303
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:55,933
And they have only one thing
left, and they want to keep
it so badly.

1304
01:17:55,966 --> 01:17:58,000
And they beg you

1305
01:17:58,033 --> 01:18:02,633
"Please... please..."

1306
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:07,400
And then you take it,
that last thing.

1307
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,833
Joy.

1308
01:18:08,866 --> 01:18:10,433
Exhalation.

1309
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:12,600
Life.

1310
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:18,233
Oh, I've upset you, Sergeant.

1311
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:21,433
Forgive me.

1312
01:18:27,066 --> 01:18:29,900
Finished so soon? I
am disappointed...

1313
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:38,100
What are you doing?

1314
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,166
A new game, Sergeant?

1315
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,700
What are you doing?
This is childish.

1316
01:18:42,733 --> 01:18:45,366
Hello? Are you watching?
Stop this, now.

1317
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,333
[Jack]
They can't see you.

1318
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:50,600
Besides, they're cops, Sergei.
They don't care about you.

1319
01:18:50,633 --> 01:18:52,966
Nobody moves unless I tell 'em.

1320
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,933
[Sergei]
No...

1321
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,633
No, I don't, uh...

1322
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:02,533
I don't like this. Hello!

1323
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:04,266
- [Jack] Louder, Sergei.
- [Sergei] Hello!

1324
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,633
- [Jack] Louder!
- [Sergei] Hello!

1325
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:08,633
- [Jack] Can't hear you, Sergei!
- [Sergei] You don't understand.

1326
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:09,833
I...

1327
01:19:09,866 --> 01:19:11,133
You must not...

1328
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,666
[Jack]
What? I must not what?

1329
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,900
[Sergei]
You can't do this.
You can't do this!

1330
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:19,833
[Jack]
Why? Why can't I?

1331
01:19:19,866 --> 01:19:22,200
[Sergei]
I... I don't like the dark.

1332
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:26,233
- [Jack] What did you say?
- I'm afraid of the dark!

1333
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:29,100
[Jack]
They're out there,
aren't they, Sergei?

1334
01:19:29,133 --> 01:19:30,733
In the dark...

1335
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,966
- they're waiting for you.
- [Sergei] No...

1336
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,566
- NOOO!!!
- [Jack] Say it!

1337
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,533
- [Sergei] No!
- [Jack] Say it, Sergei!

1338
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:43,100
[Sergei]
HELP ME, SOMEBODY!!!

1339
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:51,833
I'm looking' in
your eyes, Sergei.

1340
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:54,633
I don't feel any joy.

1341
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:59,066
No, all I feel is disgust.

1342
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,833
Outlaw, huh?

1343
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:05,500
Shall I tell you what
society is, outlaw?

1344
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:07,100
See, all it is is
a bunch of people

1345
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:09,866
trying to live together, trying
to -- trying to raise their kids

1346
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,333
trying to live decent lives

1347
01:20:11,366 --> 01:20:15,833
and trying to protect
themselves from scum like you.

1348
01:20:15,866 --> 01:20:18,166
Y'see, I get to
choose too, Sergei.

1349
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,600
I choose to protect that society

1350
01:20:20,633 --> 01:20:25,333
and to kick your arrogant,
bloodthirsty ass.

1351
01:20:25,366 --> 01:20:28,466
I got a big present for
you Sergei. Oh, you're
gonna love it too.

1352
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,533
You know what?

1353
01:20:29,566 --> 01:20:32,200
You're gonna get to spend
the rest of your life

1354
01:20:32,233 --> 01:20:35,900
in the most Darwinist Society
on the face of the Earth

1355
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:39,433
a maximum security prison
in the state of Illinois.

1356
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,500
Let's see how long you survive.

1357
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,166
[noise and commotion in station]

1358
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,700
Jack, can I talk to you?

1359
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:33,566
Yeah. What's...
what's going on here?

1360
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,766
Press conference in a few
minutes. Gordon Thomas
and entourage.

1361
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,400
Why are they having a
press conference here?

1362
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:40,166
Well that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1363
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,733
Let's find a quiet place.

1364
01:21:50,533 --> 01:21:51,400
Where's Gordon?

1365
01:21:51,433 --> 01:21:52,866

plead guilty to the charges
made against him.

And that we will cooperate fully

1378

with the District
Attorney's office with
regard to sentencing.

1379
01:22:28,366 --> 01:22:31,233
Gordon will plead guilty

1380
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:33,233
because he is guilty.

1381

to accept responsibility

for the office of Mayor.
