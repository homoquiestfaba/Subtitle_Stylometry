1
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,299
Okay, Shinobu! Come in

2
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,963
Tatsuya!

3
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,440
Kazuya! Look at me

4
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,936
Minami! Look at me

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,003
Tatsuya Kazuya Here we go!

6
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,114
We've always been together
since we were born

7
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,218
People said we were like triplets

8
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,202
Tatsuya Uesugi

9
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,201
Kazuya Uesugi

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,311
They were twins

11
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,787
I'm Minami Asakura

12
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,091
Happy days passed by like dreams

13
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,702
Our fathers loved baseball

14
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,966
We followed them

15
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,291
I'm back!

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,023
Two outs, bases loaded,
in the seventh

17
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,634
Koshien Stadium abruptly
appeared before us

18
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:28,771
To participate in the championship
tournament became our dream

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,714
Punch

20
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,149
Come here

21
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,786
The three kids messed up
their houses

22
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:46,897
Our parents built a joint
playhouse for us

23
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,830
My mother said

24
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:57,508
If only we could I ive this
way forever

25
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:26,504
I need someone who catches my ball

26
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,609
You need hard training to go to
Koshien Stadium

27
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,643
I know Girls can't play
baseball there

28
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,453
Take me there

29
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,649
Take me to Koshien

30
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:27,160
< TOUCH >

31
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,731
I'll be going

32
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,679
Hi, Punch!

33
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,612
Hi, Kazuya

34
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,809
Hi, Minami

35
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,651
You look cool

36
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,156
Why is the winner's picture
so small?

37
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,926
Get ready

38
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,303
Morning, Mom

39
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,955
Hi, stupid!

40
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,190
I slept late

41
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,800
Very, Tatsuya

42
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,040
All comic books!

43
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,209
Never mind textbooks

44
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,207
They're at school

45
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,740
Your uniform?

46
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,047
Where is it?

47
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,585
Why can't you use a hanger?

48
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,846
Let me go through!

49
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,420
A crumpled hankie

50
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,155
it's wet and smells!

51
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,352
Give it to me!

52
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,123
Bro!

53
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,527
I'd be late

54
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,473
I'm hungry

55
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,802
Because you slept late

56
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,242
Dump your stuffed animals

57
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,676
None of your concern

58
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,909
Devi I

59
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:01,849
Devi I

60
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,078
You're mean

61
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,586
- Devi I
- Bro!

62
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,622
Devi I

63
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,555
You'll turn into a toad

64
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,955
- No
- Yes

65
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,630
- No
- Yes

66
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,130
Devi I

67
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,765
Bro!

68
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,112
Meisei High School

69
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,682
Under protection of
aristocrats and merchants

70
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,852
It means the hobby of the rich

71
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:41,425
Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa
was a result of such a hobby

72
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,286
The hobby produced culture

73
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,661
This Mona Lisa in the textbook

74
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,861
She's a glamorous type

75
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,871
Tatsuya

76
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,207
What lesson are you taking?

77
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,747
Your teacher's class?

78
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,714
He was watching the girls

79
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,948
Shut up, baldhead!

80
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,188
What?

81
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,348
Kotaro

82
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,495
Baldhead!

83
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,955
Kotaro!

84
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,764
Don't eat in class!

85
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:21,899
I'm sorry

86
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,289
It breaks well Terrific!

87
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,891
Very fast, too

88
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,650
About 87 mph

89
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,099
Uesugi! Go!

90
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,137
Catch it! Catch it!

91
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,506
You did it!

92
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,885
Go home now

93
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,020
You've taken a lot of pictures

94
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,197
Remember I'm not soft

95
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,440
Nice pitch

96
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,279
Nice pitching

97
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,205
Next, fastball

98
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,637
Tatsuya

99
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,236
Take it easy!

100
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,748
Tatsuya

101
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,386
Going home so soon?

102
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,988
You want to pitch?

103
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,191
I saw you in the Little League

104
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,029
You've got a nice throwing arm

105
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,982
Join my team

106
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,399
Your brother shut them out

107
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,165
He'll go to Koshien

108
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,343
He's made the team invincible

109
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,340
Harada, stop jabbering!

110
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,178
Or no supper!

111
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,244
Go to cheer him?

112
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,774
No

113
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,222
Why not?

114
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,352
Don't worry Minami did

115
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,730
Does a blow hurt you?

116
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,864
No

117
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,505
it's a lie

118
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,402
Rather

119
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,004
Once the gong sounds, nothing
matters

120
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,748
Only boxers know by experience

121
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,995
Stay back

122
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,122
Be sure

123
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,972
Let's talk

124
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,379
Lina!

125
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,826
Let's go

126
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,563
I told you to stay back

127
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,002
I'm sorry

128
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,403
Blame yourself

129
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,578
I'm sorry

130
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,682
Change your clothes

131
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:19,190
What did you do? So dirty all over!

132
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,632
You really know what you're doing?

133
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,398
Yes, I do

134
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,804
Don't you have a dream?

135
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,702
Anything you want to do
in the future?

136
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,307
You've always been like that

137
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:44,756
Doing this and that, without
a steadfast purpose

138
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,523
Are you listening?

139
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,723
What a fool!

140
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,382
It hurts

141
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:36,274
Ecole de Paris,
a group of artists after WW1

142
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,308
Minami, have some tea

143
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,376
Thank you

144
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,578
These amulets are nice

145
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,212
Very cute

146
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,553
How many will you make?

147
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,093
Twenty

148
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,255
So many? Hard work

149
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,570
This is Enoshima Island

150
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,439
I'm not good at sewing

151
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,969
You do it allright

152
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,943
So I stealthily went upstairs

153
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:28,558
They were discussing seriously
who'd marry Minami

154
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,987
They were schoolboys

155
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,759
You have the right to choose

156
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,832
Which one would?

157
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,732
Tatsuya? Kazuya? Who'd marry me?

158
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,077
The one who takes you to Koshien

159
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,194
You know, I started boxing practice

160
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,100
Boxing?!

161
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,971
Why boxing?

162
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,511
Why not baseball?

163
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,012
Why are you angry?

164
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,448
Your fastball was great

165
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,860
It swished as you threw it

166
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,492
Speed is a talent

167
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,373
Breaking balls depend on practice

168
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,307
Why did you quit baseball?

169
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,720
Because of me?

170
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,954
Why you?

171
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,738
Look! Terrific, isn't it?

172
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,976
Lina shows all

173
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,176
One more minute

174
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:06,777
Asakura

175
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,753
Let's go

176
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,991
Thanks

177
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,062
Like a tough guy

178
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,413
Meisei Keeps Going

179
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,177
13 Strikeouts

180
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,684
Meisei Wins Again!

181
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,669
What's this?

182
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,477
Lt's dead!

183
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,201
You're no good

184
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,403
One more game!

185
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,089
A punching bag

186
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,663
Never mind

187
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,459
Attack!

188
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,203
No problem

189
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,311
Today's match We gotta win!

190
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,250
Don't sllp down, ass!

191
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,911
The last ball!

192
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,860
Strikeout! That's his fast
sllder!

193
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,796
Uesugiled Meisei to the final

194
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,859
Stay on the mat

195
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:17,903
Hello

196
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,639
He forgot this

197
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,077
He left after the match

198
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,500
He practiced very hard

199
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,431
He was serious

200
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,510
But he lost?

201
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,180
He tried his best

202
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,855
He looked cool

203
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,430
Thanks

204
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,307
Hello

205
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,749
Next, the final

206
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,324
Kazuya's in a good condition

207
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,926
My father's compllment

208
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,061
How heavy!

209
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,730
Best beef from Kobe

210
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,041
Let's make Sukiyaki

211
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,471
How was Tatsuya?

212
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,485
The boxing team secretary came

213
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:19,721
Tatsuya lost the game but
he tried hard

214
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,336
He did his best

215
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:38,948
Supper!

216
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,612
Sukiyaki for supper

217
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,820
No, thanks

218
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,925
The match is over No more diet

219
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,308
Harada coached me

220
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,483
You did your best

221
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,888
No problem

222
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,784
it's not so simple

223
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,957
What should I say?

224
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,299
A sweetie would

225
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,602
smack a kiss without a word

226
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,184
Take three meals a day

227
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,729
Harada! Get moving!

228
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,149
Why are you so cool?

229
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,787
What about?

230
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,122
What about?

231
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:21,322
What's that? Is that so simple
a thing to you?

232
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,567
Say something

233
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,238
Why did you kiss me?

234
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,712
Don't do it on a whim

235
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,476
it's not that

236
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,453
It was for you

237
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,630
Just for you, Tatsuya

238
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,584
Ishigaki, left fielder

239
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,349
Just knock a grounder and run

240
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,424
Thanks for the advice

241
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,796
Nakajima, shortstop

242
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,628
Hit the first ball

243
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,161
Hit a home run

244
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,598
As always!

245
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,240
Not as always

246
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,112
Lastly, Asakura, scorer

247
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,392
Take a rest today for the
game tomorrow

248
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,222
Get over your fatigue

249
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,564
One more game to Koshien

250
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,506
Kazuya

251
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,835
Let's do it

252
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,974
Nitta is a slugger

253
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,678
0750. His average is 0750
In the ellmination

254
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,056
I'm not surprised

255
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,022
You faced him before?

256
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,822
Yes Just once in junior high

257
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,924
I shut him out

258
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:45,903
Minami Another round

259
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,813
Eat some sandwich

260
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:56,179
But you can't tell what'll
happen next

261
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,654
Don't worry I assure you.
You'll win

262
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:10,728
Will the goddess of victory
kiss me?

263
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,646
Oh, no

264
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,180
Kazuya will have a game tomorrow

265
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,914
Tatsuya, you have nothing
to do today?

266
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:42,331
We're short of hands Join my
team for a day. I'll pay forit

267
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,078
Why are you here? I'd get
only half my pay

268
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,881
You bring Kazuya?

269
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,050
He'll have the final tomorrow

270
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,756
He just came

271
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,958
Too large for me

272
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,899
Is it washed clean?

273
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,556
Bro

274
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,699
How about a bet?

275
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:26,173
The winner will get what he wants

276
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,021
Take it easy, Kazuya

277
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,458
Strike!

278
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,239
Oh, no He's a jewel in a dunghill

279
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:56,999
I'm sorry

280
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,599
Strike!

281
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,374
Don't worry

282
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:54,182
The Sumi High batters
are immune to breaking balls

283
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,223
You can fan them

284
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:08,100
Just don't have a runner on
base before Nitta

285
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,976
You're in a good condition

286
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,949
lt'll be hot tomorrow

287
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:29,090
Go to bed now Team secretaries
must get up ear ly in the morning

288
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,660
Tough work, but

289
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,199
Take it easy

290
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,736
Let's hang in there

291
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,281
Minami

292
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,519
Remember what I said in the cafe?

293
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,391
Will you kiss me?

294
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,566
Just as a charm

295
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,172
Then I'll be able to sleep

296
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,079
Good night, secretary

297
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,439
You want to play catch?

298
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,947
Thanks

299
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,642
Gone

300
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,593
Bro, I

301
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,741
I kissed Minami

302
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,916
On the forehead

303
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,622
Why report that to me?

304
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,800
Right

305
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:36,070
Even kids kiss on the forehead

306
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,048
Take her

307
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,585
To Koshien Stadium

308
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,056
That's your task

309
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,595
You want to see

310
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,997
her smiling face?

311
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,007
Win the game

312
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,379
Never lose it!

313
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,294
I thought you were here

314
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,895
You could have invited me

315
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,741
Let's play triangular catch

316
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,944
Yes, let's!

317
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,738
We used to do this every day

318
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,968
All day until dusk

319
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,480
What interested us?

320
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,646
Well, I was fascinated

321
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:42,528
Aunt Haruko was angry because
we were late

322
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,497
She came

323
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,373
Minami

324
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,754
The memories are dear to me

325
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:11,925
Here we go!

326
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:12,959
Fight!

327
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,663
Here we go!

328
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,557
One more!

329
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:24,933
Minami

330
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,999
Minami

331
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:42,352
Are you allright?

332
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,384
Are you al right?

333
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,384
Hang on!

334
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,016
You hear me?

335
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,286
Are you allright?

336
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,547
Take it easy

337
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,513
Uesugi will come

338
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,693
Let's hang in there till then

339
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,646
Nitta gets to his feet

340
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:53,551
The slugger is at bat with
runners on bases

341
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,702
Come on, cheer up!

342
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,447
Uesugi absent? Why?

343
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,631
He hit it hard!

344
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,406
To the right field!

345
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,667
Deep! Deep!

346
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,940
Gone! A home run!

347
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,480
The excited supporters!

348
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,754
The pitcher gives way to the mound

349
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,419
The homer has cleared the bases

350
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,287
Sumi High wins 4-3

351
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,229
The team is going to Koshien
for the 17th time

352
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:34,185
Kazuya Kazuya

353
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,086
Can't belleve it

354
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,282
He's dead

355
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:26,361
Sumi High Wins Championship at Koshien

356
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,842
Uesugi!

357
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,815
A nice job for you

358
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,953
He's offering a bet

359
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,619
You pitch; he swings

360
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,951
It pays 10, 000 yen

361
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,726
If struck out, another 10, 000

362
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:12,233
You throw, that's all. A good deal

363
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:19,642
If I win, you'll join my team

364
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:23,279
He's captain He needs a pitcher

365
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,604
My last request

366
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:30,118
If you win, I won't bother you again

367
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,100
Genuine

368
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,001
Will he make it?

369
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,637
It depends

370
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:12,486
Naka j ima, drop the ball
at the waist!

371
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,883
Why all this?

372
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,152
What do you want?

373
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,585
Baseball

374
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,195
Liar

375
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,792
You didn't tell me

376
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,763
I don't have to consult you

377
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,966
Can't I play baseball?

378
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:32,341
No! Look at the mi rror

379
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:36,245
Your whim can cause a shock
to the others

380
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,377
Do I look like Kazuya?

381
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,146
Naturally

382
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,376
You, too?

383
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,444
Stupid!

384
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,757
Too bad!

385
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,361
In a uniform, he's Kazuya

386
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,621
So what?

387
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,670
I'm Kazuya's partner, and
he's not Kazuya

388
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,462
You intentionally lost the bet

389
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,990
I am exhausted this week

390
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,221
Let me see

391
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,897
Poor hands!

392
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:06,660
But they'll become tough that way

393
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,670
Did you know?

394
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,914
Of course You're team secretary

395
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:33,993
I found these under his bed.
He hid them there

396
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:37,291
He tells me nothing

397
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,467
Can't he trust his own mother?

398
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,504
Lt's not that

399
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,201
Minami

400
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:49,441
Won't you tell him to quit baseball?

401
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,471
Wait a minute

402
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,478
Why ask her that?

403
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,846
Why can't Tatsuya play baseball?

404
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,689
Why did you quit boxing?

405
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,696
You went for it Wasn't it fun?

406
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,338
You're mistaken

407
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:24,111
You're not Kazuya
You don't have to bear his life

408
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,275
I know

409
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,608
You don't

410
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,909
I like baseball, so I play it.
Can't I?

411
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,022
No You don't understand

412
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,753
Minami, persuade him

413
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,488
Please!

414
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,072
Uesugi

415
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,802
Take it easy

416
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,909
Is it fun?

417
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,624
Throw

418
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,136
Kotaro, catch

419
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,343
No

420
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,138
Kotaro!

421
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,344
He can't be a pitcher

422
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,742
Not to me

423
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,420
Somebody, catch his ball

425
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,512
No You're in danger

426
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,844
He's not a kid

427
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,252
Minami Asakura

428
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,440
You afraid?

429
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,510
Never mind hurting me

430
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,787
Be serious!

431
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:06,791
Is that your fastball?

432
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,181

You never get tired?

436
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,026
Nitta of Sumi High

437
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,263
It sounds familiar

438
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:52,866
Don't you know?

439
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,345
