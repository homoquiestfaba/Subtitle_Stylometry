1
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,846
She just went downstairs.

2
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,246
Good.

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,348
Let's get started.

4
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,508
Sarah?

5
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,209
Jules?

6
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,850
Girls?

7
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,890
Mom, Mom!

8
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,223
- Sarah?
- Please!

9
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,291
- Jules?
- Mom!

10
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,528
Momma!

11
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,729
Open the door!

12
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:15,730
- Mom, help!
- Sarah!

13
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,230
Please!

14
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,337
Jules!

15
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,743
Jules?

16
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,343
- Yeah?
- You okay?

17
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,715
Zonin' out there, babe.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

18
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:15,623
What is he saying?

19
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,060
He's telling her to shut up.

20
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,436
Can you tell him to stop?

21
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,404
I don't think we need him.
- Jules, I don't think we should interfere.

22
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,272
I don't think we need it.

23
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:32,874
It's fine.

24
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,876
Tell him to stop, please.

25
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,810
What is he saying?

26
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:13,413
He says, "All of this
might look barbaric to her,

27
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,551
but if she keeps silent,

28
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:20,021
she might learn a thing or
two about helping others,

29
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,523
instead of making money
from their misery".

30
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,028
Excuse me?

31
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,730
I'm sorry, I
think he's hurting her.

32
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:30,998
We don't need it.

33
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,399
Tell him we can just stop it.

34
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,034
We don't need it.

35
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:33,901
Thank you.

36
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,507
Does it make you
sleep better at night

37
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,009
thinking you can shut
out the things you see?

38
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,081
Excuse me?

39
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:44,772
And cut.

40
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,874
Good, you got it?

41
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:47,675
- Got it.
- Good.

42
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,809
Ben, you good?
- Yeah, I got it.

43
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:49,409
Good.

44
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,144
All right, let's pack up.

45
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:50,912
Let's wrap out.

46
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:51,345
- Thanks.
- We're gonna get on

47
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,080
the move soon.

48
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:54,447
Jules, you good?

49
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,383
I'll be there in a minute, yeah.

50
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,717
All right, we'll be in the van.

51
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,153
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,488
I thought you were hurting her.

53
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,558
The nails contain a curse

54
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,127
sent by a former lover,

55
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,897
but you could tell
that, couldn't you,

56
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,200
even if you no longer see?

57
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:19,540
There is no evil,
only ignorance.

58
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,181
That's easy for you to say.

59
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,751
You have an ability,

60
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,589
but you use it only for profit.

61
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,825
We all have bills to pay.

62
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:50,671
What is it?

63
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,008
Our sorrows and
wounds are healed

64
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,746
only when you touch them
with your compassion.

65
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,052
Jules, we gotta go!

66
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,260
You good?
- You guys ready?

67
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,262
Let's go.

68
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,831
I'm always laggin' behind.

69
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,801
I need the fuck outta here.

70
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,737
Okay, remember where to go?

71
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,904
The same way we came

72
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,206
with a different intersection.

73
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,774
The same way we came, you idiot!

74
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:28,943
Oh, my god!

75
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:29,777
Here, pull over right now.

76
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,811
Just let me drive.

77
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:31,712
I can handle this.
- No!

78
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:32,580
Wolf, I know the way.

79
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,748
- God, you're such a baby!
- I got this.

80
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,582
Let's go!

81
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,296
How do you they didn't get shot?

82
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,135
Okay, I guess we're back
to keepin' secrets then.

83
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,674
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,343
Look at you two, makin'
out in front of us,

85
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,045
not makin' us feel weird at all.

86
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,747
You ever heard the saying,
don't shit where you eat?

87
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,348
It's for you.

88
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,116
It's for me?

89
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,350
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, we can do more?

90
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,752
Yeah, keep doin' it.

91
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,886
Oh, yeah, this'll be fun.

92
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,026
So Annie, I was wondering,

93
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,628
why did you drag
us to that place?

94
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,165
I mean, do you like seeing
monks hurt little girls?

95
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,867
- Come on, man!
- Hey!

96
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,068
Don't mind my brother.

97
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,770
Most people find
it hard to believe,

98
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,906
but beneath that asshole front
is a really sensitive soul.

99
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,343
Beneath that is a
crusty, old bastard.

100
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:14,415
I didn't like what the monks
were doing either, you know.

101
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,417
I just thought it
would be interesting,

102
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,751
because Mr. Crane mentioned it.

103
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,720
No, no, no, just Matty.

104
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,655
We're all family here.

105
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,057
Okay, Matty.

106
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,658
I thought it was interesting
for your show, you know.

107
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,726
It was my fault.

108
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,294
He was just trying to help her.

109
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,698
Is that what he
said, he's helping her?

110
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,403
You know what?

111
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,105
Annie, I just
realized we haven't

112
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,242
officially welcomed you
to "The Skeleton Crew".

113
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:46,280
So this is for you.

114
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,749
Yay!

115
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,050
Welcome!

116
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,152
- Yay!
- Nice!

117
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,019
Thank you.

118
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:57,458
So how do you guys figure
where you are going next?

119
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,393
Jules,

120
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,162
will you do the honors?
- First...

121
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,165
- Wolf.
- Yep, yep, yep.

122
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,366
Oh, yep.

123
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,333
Yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep.

124
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,768
Ready?

125
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,103
Rollin'.

126
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,704
So ever since we announced
we're touring Asia,

127
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,406
viewers in the region
have been writing to us

128
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,941
to investigate their homes.

129
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,210
Now, most of them aren't
genuinely haunted,

130
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,781
but this is how we choose
which ones are, or might be.

131
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,318
Bullshit.

132
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,421
Bullshit.

133
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,289
Bullshit.

134
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,224
Faking it.

135
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,092
Nonsense.

136
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,395
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

137
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,331
Is she even reading them?

138
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,365
Just watch.

139
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,735
Definitely faking it.

140
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,938
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

141
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,208
Faking it, bullshit.

142
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,809
Bullshit.

143
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,086
We have something.
- Yeah?

144
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,222
Great, here we go.

145
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:05,326
Fraser's Hill in
the state of Pahang.

146
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,827
Did I pronounce
that right, Anne?

147
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,229
- Yes, Pahong.
- Great.

148
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,533
Wolf.

149
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,967
All right, well,
I will call them

150
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,201
and tell 'em we're on our way.

151
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:19,507
Okay, it's a four hour drive.

152
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,476
This how you
choose the location?

153
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,911
Based on what?

154
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,146
Effin' freaky shit, huh?

155
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,282
God, I hate this
stupid seatbelt!

156
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,917
I'm not wearing it anymore.
- I'm sorry,

157
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,151
turn back a little bit.

158
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,853
Take a left at the next corner.

159
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:33,988
All right.

160
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,256
Is it on?

161
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,890
Yeah, go ahead.

162
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,394
It's okay, honey.
- Okay.

163
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,831
Well, hi.

164
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:55,943
My name is Martha Benchley,
and this is Ian, my husband.

165
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,111
Hi.

166
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,348
Yeah, we heard
"The Skeleton Crew"

167
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:02,816
was coming over to Asia,

168
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,552
and, like, I mean, we-
- We're big fans.

169
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,157
So-
- Yeah, we watch

170
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,159
the show all the time
when here in Malaysia.

171
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:14,461
And...

172
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,798
We...

173
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,907
Hey!

174
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,342
You know, they get this
all the time, right?

175
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,877
Just tell 'em.

176
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,911
It's okay, honey.

177
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,146
All right?

178
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,122
Look, we...

179
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,395
We desperately need your help.

180
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,304
Please help us.

181
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,029
Get off me!

182
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,121
You're sure we got
the right address?

183
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:50,023
This is it.

184
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,102
All right.

185
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,506
Here we go.

186
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,981
It's a nice place.

187
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,115
Where's the welcome wagon?

188
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,684
Hey, Mr. Benchley?

189
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:18,118
Matty Crane here.

190
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,254
Yes, yes, we just arrived.

191
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,556
So listen, we'd love
to get a shot of you

192
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,091
coming out of the house
and greeting Jules.

193
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,994
Yeah, but don't mention
the show on camera,

194
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,163
and don't look
straight at it, okay?

195
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,964
No, it kinda breaks
the fourth wall.

196
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,434
The fourth...

197
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,103
Just don't look at it and
don't mention the show, okay?

198
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,071
Great.

199
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,974
Oh, we're unloading now.

200
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,076
Come out in about a minute?

201
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,044
Yeah.

202
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,112
Batteries.

203
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,048
All right, see you then.

204
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,751
Bye.
- Batteries.

205
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,218
Charged?

206
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,453
Charge the batteries?
- Yeah, let's go.

207
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,254
Okay, guys, let's set up...

208
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,989
Let's set up right here.

209
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,525
Let's get him as he's comin'
outta the front door, okay?

210
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like every other time

211
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:03,130
we do this, of course.

212
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:07,100
Well, this is truly an honor.

213
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,603
Ian Benchley.

214
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,337
Thank you so much for
coming, Ms. Julia.

215
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,774
My wife and I, we're
big fans of your show.

216
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:13,775
Just Jules, please.

217
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,043
Right, Jules, Jules.

218
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,546
You know, when your
producer told us

219
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,748
that we've been chosen
to be on the show,

220
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,750
I couldn't believe it.
- Yeah, that'd be me.

221
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:23,785
You guys cut.

222
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,018
Matty Crane.

223
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,019
- Ian.
- Nice to meet you,

224
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,287
Mr. Benchley.

225
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,022
We just now spoke
about the fourth wall.

226
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,358
Yeah.

227
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,260
This is my cameraman,
Wolf and Ben.

228
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,328
The cameramen.

229
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,097
The real geniuses behind
"The Skeleton Crew".

230
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,199
You wouldn't know
that by how much he pays us.

231
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,537
And this is our local
translator and guide, Annie.

232
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,505
Hi.

233
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,072
Well...

234
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,274
Right, as I was saying,
thank you all for coming.

235
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,141
There.

236
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,211
Thank you for comin'.

237
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,515
I mean, it's been a relief

238
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,048
since we knew we were
gonna be on the show,

239
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,584
especially for Martha, my wife.

240
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,987
And she's inside.

241
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,256
Things haven't been
going too well lately.

242
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,125
Why don't you tell
us all about it?

243
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,159
Right.

244
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,730
You'll understand as
soon as you come in.

245
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:13,768
Wow!

246
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,205
It's beautiful.

247
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,116
The house is so new.

248
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:34,087
Haunted houses usually
aren't this freshly built.

249
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,592
- Well-
- It is fairly new.

250
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,294
It was built in the
1970s, I believe.

251
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,784
If you don't mind,
Martha's this way.

252
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:04,552
Sure.

253
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:09,156
Earth Mother who art in heaven,

254
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,593
hallowed be thy name.

255
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,226
Thy kingdom come,

256
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:18,198
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in heaven.

257
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,835
Give us today our daily bread,

258
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,804
and forgive us our sins,

259
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,572
as we forgive sins.

260
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,173
Honey?

261
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:30,377
It just happened again, Ian.

262
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,411
I don't know how long

263
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,614
I can take this.

264
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:33,715
- It's okay.
- No.

265
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:34,816
It-
- Breathe.

266
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,185
- What?
- Look who's here.

267
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:42,757
No.

268
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:44,792
Oh, I'm so sorry.

269
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,493
Can we pan across?

270
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:47,595
I'm such a mess.

271
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:48,796
You don't want me to just snap,

272
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,163
zooming it out over
and over again?

273
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,866
- Your Martha?
- Just do it, Wolf.

274
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,400
Come on.

275
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,769
Why don't you
tell us what happened?

276
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,237
Oh, that's what we're
hoping you would tell us.

277
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,473
Like, look, this just happened.

278
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:03,276
I just painted these.

279
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,246
She gets into a trance,

280
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,348
paints pictures of this man.

281
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,652
She's never met him or seen him.

282
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,562
Do you feel anything?

283
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,564
Can you sense them?

284
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:25,198
Let her do her job.

285
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,299
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,334
I just...

287
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,201
Sorry.

288
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,188
Jules?

289
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,291
I got nothing.

290
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,492
Can you try again?

291
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,261
Something's off.

292
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,462
You chose this place.

293
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:57,932
On the email and
the video, yeah,

294
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,968
but ever since I've been
here, I've got nothing.

295
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,672
So what now?

296
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:05,540
There's more.

297
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:08,576
If that helps?

298
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,983
Martha, were you watchin'
us from an upstairs window?

299
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:18,351
Well, I wasn't.

300
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,525
We moved in here
around six months ago.

301
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,594
Ian was doing business in KL.

302
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:28,696
Kuala Lumpur?

303
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,997
Yeah, I mostly work from home,

304
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,999
and this place on the
market for such a steal

305
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,534
we just had to have it.

306
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,268
And the first three
months, nothing happened.

307
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,704
We moved in.

308
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:38,806
We decorated the house, and-
- The previous owner

309
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,908
was an nice man, Australian?
- Yeah.

310
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,410
Lived here for a
couple of months with his wife.

311
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,378
That's not long.

312
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,247
Well, about two months ago,

313
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,586
some pretty weird stuff
started happening.

314
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:52,920
I'd go to sleep,

315
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:54,522
but ever morning I'd wake up

316
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,323
in different parts of the house.

317
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,493
I'd wake up in
bed covered in soil.

318
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,328
That's strange.

319
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,697
You must be very religious?

320
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,298
Not really.

321
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,634
Ever since all this started,

322
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,037
it's comforting to have
them around the house.

323
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:21,015
This happened shortly after
we contacted you guys.

324
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:26,587
It's there.

325
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,963
This, the paintings,
this never happened before.

326
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:40,701
It's like whatever's doing
this is threatening us somehow.

327
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:42,837
Or trying to stop
us from gettin' help.

328
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:47,074
Anything?

329
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:48,375
- Mm-mmm.
- Hey!

330
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,489
Those are my garden shears.

331
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,490
I was cuttin'
flowers this morning.

332
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:04,725
I must've left 'em there.

333
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,764
Could this be like a poltergeist
or something, you think?

334
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:12,567
Poltergeist is just a
German word for ghost.

335
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,468
Noisy ghost to be exact.

336
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,738
That or seismic activity.

337
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,475
Martha, do you have any
pets, like a dog or anything?

338
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,479
You don't seriously
believe a dog did this?

339
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,751
We're just trying to
rule out the possibilities.

340
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:34,121
Maybe you should
see the basement?

341
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:39,927
We had workers come in

342
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,729
to rewire the
basement last week,

343
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,463
but they refused to come down.

344
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:46,466
Just watch the step.

345
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,035
Guys, whoa.

346
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,907
We mostly use the
basement for storage, laundry,

347
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,076
but we stopped usin'
it for the time being.

348
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,181
Oh, good god!

349
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,583
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, wow!

350
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:03,584
What's that?

351
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:06,419
It smells like roasted dick!

352
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:07,420
Duck.

353
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,723
The smell started last week.

354
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:11,659
We've tried almost
everything to get rid of it.

355
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,895
We even tried
scrubbin' everything down.

356
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,563
Yeah, but it only got worse.

357
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,699
Can I borrow these?

358
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,533
Sure.

359
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,550
No, listen, that
has to be recent.

360
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,753
I told you, we scrubbed
every inch of this floor.

361
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:39,654
That wasn't there.

362
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:40,888
You have to believe us!

363
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,056
I mean, seriously,

364
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,456
you can't take the case?
- Okay.

365
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,158
No, we're good.

366
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,660
I think we've seen...

367
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,862
I think we've seen
everything we need to see.

368
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,097
Thank you.

369
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,098
Appreciate it.

370
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:51,966
Nice to meet you.

371
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:56,137
So you must think
we're idiots or worse,

372
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:59,507
that we made all this stuff up?

373
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,008
I don't.

374
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,244
I think sometimes we want
these things to be real,

375
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,646
so we make them
real in our minds.

376
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,751
What is that?
- What?

377
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,887
That noise?

378
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,661
Martha?

379
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:11,645
Jules!

380
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:13,748
Jules, what the...

381
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:14,582
Jules, what the...

382
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:15,816
What the fuck are you doing?
- Stop it!

383
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,884
What...

384
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:17,852
Stop it!

385
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:18,786
- Matty, stop!
- Stop!

386
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,021
Stop it!

387
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,589
We popped 10 fuckin'
benzos in a row!

388
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:23,858
- It's my fucking medication!
- All right, stop.

389
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:28,062
What the fuck
happened down there?

390
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,997
Fuck!

391
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,001
I fucking saw it, Matty.

392
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:35,736
What?

393
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,973
Whatever it
is that's haunting that house

394
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:39,974
fucking touched me!

395
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,109
Okay?

396
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,011
It's trying to make contact.

397
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:46,113
It's trying to make it through.

398
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,281
Okay.

399
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:48,215
Well, that...

400
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,051
It's a good thing, right?

401
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,854
It's not supposed
to happen like that.

402
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:55,122
What are you talking about?

403
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,590
What do you mean?

404
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:58,793
We deal with this
kinda shit every day!

405
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:00,861
Jules, I have seen you
lead our cameras to places,

406
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,763
to things I can't even explain.

407
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,633
Because I sense them.

408
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,333
I hear them.

409
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:07,968
That is it.

410
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,703
I point the camera
in some direction,

411
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,639
you get some bullshit on
camera, and we fuck off,

412
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,606
and we get paid.

413
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,707
That is all I signed up for!

414
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,844
But they don't fucking
touch me, Matty!

415
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,581
Because I do not want them to.

416
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:23,684
I can't have them.

417
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:31,692
Okay.

418
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,632
I'm not gonna let
them hurt you, okay?

419
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,703
I promise.

420
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,202
Can you hear me?

421
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:16,670
Loud and clear.

422
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,372
Comin' down the next room.

423
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,674
So these are the
night vision cameras?

424
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,110
No, better, they record
on multiple wavelengths,

425
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,812
infrared, all that stuff.

426
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,680
Yeah, thermo sensitive as well.

427
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,849
Many, they can detect minute
changes in room temperature.

428
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:31,752
We've got them wired to
every corner of the house,

429
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,788
so if something turns
up, we'll get it on tape.

430
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:35,856
Yep.

431
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,857
Good.

432
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,392
I guess we'll leave you to it.

433
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:39,994
Yeah.

434
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,795
And there's food and drinks
in the kitchen stocked.

435
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,230
Great, thank you.

436
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,832
- Thank you.
- Okay.

437
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,000
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

438
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,739
So I'll go to bed, too.

439
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:52,806
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

440
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,742
Goodnight.

441
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,443
Okay, we're all set.

442
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,078
Nice work.

443
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:03,450
Did you talk to him?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:06,687
What?

445
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:09,023
My brother and I
were sort of wondering

446
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,358
when we're gonna get
our first payment?

447
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,893
I mean, we only came
all the way out here

448
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:13,994
because of cash you promised.

449
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:15,329
And you're gonna get it

450
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,199
as soon as this episode
is wrapped, as promised.

451
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,467
Like you promised us in Austin?

452
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:22,803
Austin wasn't my show.

453
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:23,505
You know that!

454
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:24,506
I was the line producer.

455
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,739
I got screwed, too.

456
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,975
- Bullshit.
- Hey!

457
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,811
Didn't I get you two a union
gig for a whole season?

458
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:36,050
Yeah.

459
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,017
It's fine with me.

460
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,452
You cool?

461
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:39,386
- Yeah.
- All right.

462
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,223
Okay.

463
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,824
Boss, by the way,

464
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,127
what the hell happened earlier?

465
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:48,963
I haven't seen her
like that before.

466
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,134
Honestly, I don't have
a fuckin' clue either.

467
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:47,154
Want me to go?

468
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,222
- Then go ahead.
- All right.

469
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,824
This pair of five's
is a queen kicker.

470
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:51,526
What you got?

471
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,826
What you got, son?

472
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,595
Boom!

473
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,297
What the fuck, man?!

474
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,599
That's three times
in a row tonight.

475
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,166
Losin' your touch there, bro.

476
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,868
- No, you're cheating, bro!
- I'm fuckin' not.

477
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:01,536
God!

478
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,406
You ever wonder why
people don't just move?

479
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:08,409
I mean, if their house is
haunted, why would you stay here?

480
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:09,443
I don't know.

481
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,612
Would you move if you
dumped all your life savings

482
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:11,613
into the house?

483
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:12,479
Yeah, I'd move!

484
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:13,847
Are you kidding me?!

485
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,087
And what if they move

486
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,589
and the spirit
follows them, and...

487
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:22,856
Shit, shit!

488
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,991
Where's Ian going?

489
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:26,894
We've got a walker.

490
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,942
Where are you
goin', Mr. Benchley?

491
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:46,146
All right, 10 bucks
says the guy takes a leak.

492
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,115
You don't have 10 bucks.

493
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,397
Did that shut down?
- No.

494
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,570
Camera.

495
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,371
- Come on.
- Camera, camera, camera!

496
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:12,473
Wheel.

497
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,343
Go time.

498
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:17,478
Come on, come on, come on!

499
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:19,380
Go, go, go, go, go!

500
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:20,948
To the right!

501
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,120
- Oh, shit!
- Help me!

502
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:28,255
Oh, shit!

503
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:29,456
Holy shit!
- Help me!

504
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:31,593
Whoa!

505
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:34,995
Martha?

506
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,202
- Why won't you-
- Martha!

507
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:48,710
Martha!

508
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,016
No!

509
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:06,293
Martha?

510
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,428
Martha?

511
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:11,331
Martha?

512
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,635
Jules?

513
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,068
Jules?
- Matty?

514
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,203
Jules?

515
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,204
Matty?!

516
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:17,971
- Come on!
- Matty!

517
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,173
Jules!

518
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,407
Jules!

519
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:21,442
- Matty!
- The door!

520
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,076
Why don't you open the door?

521
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,944
Martha?

522
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:27,515
Martha?

523
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,683
Jules, can you hear me?

524
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:29,651
- What's happening?
- Jules?

525
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:31,151
They're locked inside.

526
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,286
- Who's locked inside?
- Jules and Martha!

527
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,021
Martha!

528
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,957
Martha!
- Open the door!

529
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,730
Martha?

530
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:46,166
Jules?

531
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,769
Jules?

532
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,705
Martha!

533
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,774
Jules!

534
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:56,644
Martha?

535
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:00,981
Martha.

536
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,619
- You're Jules.
- You okay?

537
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:08,055
What happened?

538
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,090
Where am I?

539
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:11,058
It's okay.

540
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,165
It's okay.

541
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,618
Oh, god!

542
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,820
Quick!

543
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:46,426
It's okay.

544
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,629
It's all right.

545
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,048
Sorry.

546
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,417
Help me!

547
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,686
Fuck me!

548
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,186
This is fuckin' insane!

549
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,422
I mean, we've done
haunted houses before,

550
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:50,525
possessions,
exorcisms, you name it.

551
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,660
We've never seen
anything as genuine,

552
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,361
as concrete, as this, man.

553
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:56,196
Whoa, you're gonna bust a
nut if you don't slow down.

554
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:58,600
No, no, this is the first
time in the history of the show

555
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,702
that we've ever come
close to actually proving

556
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,302
the existence of the paranormal.

557
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:03,605
I mean, look at the footage!

558
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,172
Yeah, the kid's right.

559
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,576
At least no one will say
we're faking it anymore.

560
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:33,801
Everything all right?

561
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,173
Fuck, yeah,
I can't do this, Matty.

562
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,809
Jules, Jules?

563
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,478
Shit!

564
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,179
Off she goes again.

565
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:49,784
Pull up Annie's bedroom.

566
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:51,719
- I'm quitting!
- What?!

567
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,621
Jules!

568
00:35:53,655 --> 00:35:54,922
Stop!

569
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:56,356
I can't do this, Matty.

570
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,625
Okay, I'm seein' it everywhere!

571
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:58,660
What?

572
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,394
This is gonna keep going
until it hurts somebody.

573
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:01,328
We need to leave.

574
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,295
Well, then, don't look.

575
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,765
Look away.

576
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:04,732
It doesn't work like that!

577
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,233
You think I haven't tried?!

578
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,669
Well, then, try and
communicate with it.

579
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:08,936
You've only ever
listened, right?

580
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,204
You've only ever
overheard things?

581
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,439
Find out what it wants!

582
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:13,775
We've never done
that for the show!

583
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,375
You don't know what
you're talking about.

584
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,678
If you knew what could
happen, you wouldn't even ask.

585
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:19,914
Well, then tell me
what is gonna happen!

586
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:22,950
You can't just
fucking leave, Jules!

587
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:24,284
We're doing a show,
for Christ's sake!

588
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:24,919
You're show!

589
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:26,186
Our show!

590
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,525
That's all you ever
cared about, isn't it?

591
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:31,893
That is not fair.

592
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:46,974
That's good.

593
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:47,775
- All right.
- Make sure you

594
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:48,475
back this one up, too.

595
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:49,777
Yeah, I'll transfer it.

596
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:50,477
Good morning.

597
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:54,949
Wait.

598
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,018
Where the fuck were you?

599
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,251
What?

600
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,253
- Last night?
- Wait a minute.

601
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:03,891
Yeah, you were asleep just
before the possession.

602
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,029
You didn't hear anything
strange last night?

603
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,664
What are you talking about?

604
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:13,433
All right, see for yourself.

605
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,005
You're tellin' us

606
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:18,973
you slept through
the whole thing?

607
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:19,907
- Martha.
- I need to

608
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:21,042
speak with Jules, please.

609
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,845
- Jules...
- Went out for a bit.

610
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,049
I need you to see something.

611
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,091
Look at me, look
at me, look at me.

612
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,560
It's Ian, it's Ian, look at me.

613
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:46,694
Look at me.

614
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:47,628
Look at me.

615
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:49,396
It was just a dream, okay?

616
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,833
It was just a dream, huh?

617
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:55,036
All right.

618
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:55,903
Give me that.

619
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,038
Give it to me.

620
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,371
Give it to me.

621
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,607
Go back to sleep.
- Uh-huh.

622
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,441
All right?

623
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:16,123
She does not look good.

624
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:20,962
It wasn't easy
convincin' the doctor

625
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,530
she'd fallen down the stairs.

626
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,167
But if I'd told him

627
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,101
what really happened-
- I know.

628
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,704
I know.

629
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:38,779
She remembered
somethin' from last night.

630
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:41,549
It was in her dreams this time.

631
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:49,190
This is the
same man she drew before.

632
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:08,609
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

633
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,115
A long night, huh?

634
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:15,750
You have no idea.

635
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:18,619
Can I have a scotch,
please, no ice?

636
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:19,553
Sure.

637
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:29,163
Thank you.

638
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:30,531
You are American.

639
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:32,432
I recognize the accent.

640
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:35,569
Guilty as charged.

641
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:38,172
You local?

642
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,641
Well, for the past 50-odd years.

643
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:41,876
Are you staying in town?

644
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,645
You know the Benchley's?

645
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,513
I do.

646
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,580
It is a small town.

647
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,183
Are you one of the
Benchley family?

648
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,153
No, no, I'm...

649
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:53,854
I'm doin' a thing
at their house.

650
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:57,792
Kind of like a
investigative journalist.

651
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:59,794
Journalist, ah!

652
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:01,494
We don't get many up here.

653
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,665
Funny you should
mention the house.

654
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,169
Most people here try to
avoid talking about it.

655
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,003
Why?

656
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:14,542
Every person who has ever
lived in the house moved out,

657
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:16,243
and suddenly, too.

658
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,249
Where are you going?

659
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:24,518
I'm gonna go look for Jules.

660
00:41:24,552 --> 00:41:25,519
May I join you?

661
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:32,293
Not a good idea, Annie.

662
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,961
But why don't you stay
here with the guys?

663
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:34,829
I won't be long.

664
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:48,242
You must love her a lot?

665
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:52,013
You get to a certain point

666
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:53,681
where you stop
believing in love.

667
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:58,753
So what do you believe in then?

668
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,057
Jules and I are two people

669
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,292
who happened to need each
other at the right moment,

670
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:08,562
and that moment got picked up,

671
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,299
renewed for a second season.

672
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,972
What happened seemed like

673
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:19,774
something ruins the moment?

674
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,812
What, like Jules
running off now?

675
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:27,948
I didn't say that.

676
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:32,253
What do you know
about the house?

677
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:35,322
It was built by a
local businessman.

678
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:37,625
It was his holiday retreat.

679
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:41,295
But one day, he just
disappeared, just like that.

680
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:42,897
And after that,

681
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,666
the house just has been
passing from owner to owner.

682
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:50,104
Do you know anything
about the last owners?

683
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:53,140
Australian couple, the Keenes.

684
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,342
Rumors say his wife suffered

685
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:57,945
a mysterious and
terrible injury.

686
00:42:59,146 --> 00:43:00,748
What kind?

687
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:04,151
Enough for them to move
out just after a few months.

688
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:07,054
All the previous owners left
under similar circumstances.

689
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:09,623
What circumstances?

690
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:14,161
Something terrible
happened to their wives.

691
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,976
Maybe when you go
back to the house,

692
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,277
you will be able to see?

693
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:34,014
Your friends are in grave
danger if you don't.

694
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:44,925
Huh?

695
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,093
And you talk to who?

696
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,195
I was...

697
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,098
I'm sorry, who is that?

698
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:53,901
Used to own this place.

699
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,202
Okay, what do you
mean, "used to"?

700
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:56,670
He's dead.

701
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,207
Years ago.
- How?

702
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,408
His pregnant wife,

703
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:03,811
one day, she just disappeared.

704
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:06,380
He died from sorrow.

705
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:08,015
And how did you get in here?
- I'm sorry!

706
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:08,649
This place is closed,

707
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:09,683
you know?
- I'm sorry!

708
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:10,451
I'm sorry!

709
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:16,323
When I first met Jules,
she was a total train wreck.

710
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:20,394
In and out of rehab,
waiting to explode,

711
00:44:22,863 --> 00:44:24,064
but she had this ability.

712
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,068
I suggested we go into
business together.

713
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:31,438
A TV producer and the medium.

714
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:37,878
She's always carried her
past around with her.

715
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:42,183
I've tried to get her
to open up about it,

716
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:45,786
but-
- She's secretive

717
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:51,492
and it hurts that she
shuts you out sometimes.

718
00:44:58,799 --> 00:44:59,433
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,436
That was out of line.

720
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,307
But not far off the mark.

721
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:10,878
This coffee
isn't workin' for shit!

722
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,947
So tired.

723
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,282
Hey, you hear that?

724
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,785
What?

725
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:27,027
Play it again.

726
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:35,302
What is that?

727
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:40,040
Sounds like a crying kid.

728
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,843
The Benchley's don't have a kid.

729
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:46,080
I'm gonna try and
isolate the sound.

730
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,422
What the fuck?

731
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,294
I've got a camera malfunction.

732
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,157
Okay, okay, okay.

733
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:12,627
Okay.

734
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:27,509
Fuck you!

735
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:28,442
Fuck you!

736
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:30,612
Whoo, yeah.

737
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,349
Ben?

738
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:54,001
Ben?

739
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:57,605
Ben?

740
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,978
- No, Ben.
- Come on, come on!

741
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:05,713
Come on!

742
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:07,615
- Ben!
- Come on!

743
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:08,482
Ben, Ben!

744
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:10,685
Wake up.
- Oh, my god!

745
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:12,019
- Shit!
- What happened?

746
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:12,986
Where the fuck you been?

747
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,488
Oh, no!
- Ben!

748
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,023
Hold him, hold him!

749
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:16,691
Look at me!

750
00:49:16,724 --> 00:49:18,158
Ben, look at me!

751
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,426
He's having a seizure.

752
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,428
- Ben!
- Do something!

753
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:22,597
No!

754
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,264
- It's the man!
- What?

755
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:26,033
Put something in his mouth
or he'll chew his tongue out!

756
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:27,000
Okay, hold.

757
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,570
It's the man in my dreams!

758
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:31,071
It's him!

759
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,712
Our Father,

760
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:39,480
who art in heaven...

761
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:44,652
Hallowed be thy name.

762
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:46,086
As thy kingdom come...

763
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:51,693
We know you killed your sister.

764
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:55,563
She suffers greatly.

765
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:59,032
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

766
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,334
Give us today our daily bread.

767
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:05,607
Deliver us from evil.

768
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:10,410
Ben, Ben?

769
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:12,112
Hey, hey!

770
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:13,413
Hey, hey, hi!

771
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,731
This'll help.

772
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:38,773
Jules?

773
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,280
God!

774
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:48,081
Yo, what the hell
happened to my brother?

775
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:52,185
And why didn't you help him?

776
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,254
I mean, you're the
fucking expert, right?

777
00:50:56,123 --> 00:50:57,157
He was possessed.

778
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:00,528
Possessed by who?

779
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:01,796
I don't know!

780
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,330
You don't know
or you won't say?!

781
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:05,733
Why don't you bring
it down a notch, huh?

782
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:10,304
Whatever possessed Ben
seems to know a lot about you.

783
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:15,610
Don't you wanna stop it?

784
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:16,578
Or maybe...

785
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:17,879
Maybe you're scared of it?

786
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:19,413
Maybe you're scared of
what it knows about you?

787
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:20,380
Is that what it is?

788
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,118
What it said about your
sister, is that true?

789
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:26,153
Did you kill her?

790
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:27,321
Don't

791
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,323
you fucking bring her into this!

792
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:34,161
Listen, you are
gonna help my brother.

793
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,364
Go out, have a smoke,
take your pills,

794
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:41,134
do whatever you have to do
to pull yourself together,

795
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:43,470
and then you're gonna
come back in here,

796
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:45,238
and you're gonna
make him better.

797
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:46,841
You hear me?!

798
00:51:46,874 --> 00:51:48,776
Right, right, enough.

799
00:51:51,178 --> 00:51:53,548
You need to calm yourself.

800
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:55,750
This is bullshit!

801
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:04,859
Fuck!

802
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,126
Fuck!

803
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:17,237
What will you do now?

804
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,575
I don't know.

805
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:24,646
Matty?

806
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:49,269
Shit!

807
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:54,676
Shit!

808
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,343
Jules, stop.

809
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:57,444
- Forget it,
- Jules, stop!

810
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:58,345
Will you talk to me?

811
00:52:58,378 --> 00:52:59,346
About what?

812
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:01,348
Look, we were out
looking for you.

813
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:02,249
I was worried about you.

814
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:02,917
I could tell.

815
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:06,888
She kissed me.

816
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:09,891
Yeah, and I kissed her back.

817
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,728
What do you want me to say?

818
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:19,299
Jules, when you don't take
care of something, it dies.

819
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:22,537
You're gonna blame me for this?

820
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:24,438
Do you know

821
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,707
how hard it is to
love someone like you?

822
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:28,910
No matter what I do,

823
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,647
no matter how hard I try,
I'm not good enough for you.

824
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:35,449
I can't help you.

825
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:36,684
I can't understand
what's going on with you,

826
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,720
because you won't let me.

827
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,421
What am I supposed to do?

828
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:44,424
I was trying to
protect you, Matty.

829
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,727
From what?

830
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,562
You don't wanna know.

831
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:55,830
Thanks.

832
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,878
When I was a kid, I used
to see them, talk to them,

833
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,716
and I would call them,
and they would come,

834
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:20,755
my aunt, this old man
who lived downstairs.

835
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:25,793
No one believed me,
except my sister, Sarah.

836
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:28,428
She knew.

837
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:32,967
And we made a game of it.

838
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,704
We would lock
ourselves in our room,

839
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:39,472
and we'd call up the soul
of some, like, celebrity

840
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,442
we had heard had
died, or our cat.

841
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:46,113
And then one day,

842
00:55:46,147 --> 00:55:48,649
we called up the soul
of the boy who had died.

843
00:55:50,585 --> 00:55:53,087
Sarah had had a crush on
him for the longest time.

844
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:57,859
But when he came, he
didn't wanna leave.

845
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:00,393
He was angry.

846
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:02,597
Get out!

847
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,633
And he ate her soul
and made me watch.

848
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:21,582
Ever since that day,

849
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:23,517
I swore I'd never
contact another spirit,

850
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,620
and I tried shutting
it out altogether,

851
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:26,921
and I tried everything.

852
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,159
And then one day,
it just stopped.

853
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:38,032
But I've seen
you, I mean, on TV.

854
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,133
You can sense them.

855
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:41,736
Yeah, that part never goes away.

856
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,905
I figure, you might as
well make a living, right?

857
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:47,909
But the point is, is that
I stopped contacting them,

858
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:49,510
and they stopped talking to me,

859
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:55,448
and I can't go through
that again, Martha.

860
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:57,518
I'm sorry.

861
00:56:58,519 --> 00:56:59,186
I can't help you.

862
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:11,666
At least, please help my baby.

863
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:18,773
The doctor's confirmed it.

864
00:57:21,142 --> 00:57:22,843
I've known for a
couple weeks now.

865
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,753
How far along are you?

866
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:33,721
Three months.

867
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:35,488
Ian doesn't know.

868
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:39,492
I made the doctor
swear not to tell him.

869
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:40,795
He doesn't want kids.

870
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:47,467
And for some reason,
despite all that's happened,

871
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,738
the baby's still alive.

872
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:57,178
Please.

873
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:00,480
I don't wanna lose my baby.

874
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:05,519
Please.

875
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:10,191
These symbols, do
you know what they mean?

876
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,160
Can you read them?

877
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,033
That's weird.

878
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:19,900
I can't.

879
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:25,239
But they look like the symbols
of the good luck charms,

880
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:27,975
the one the monk
made in the temple.

881
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:30,177
Like the symbols the
monk tattooed on the girl?

882
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:31,612
Yes.

883
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:32,880
But I thought that
was for protection

884
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:34,815
to, like, ward off
evil or some shit?

885
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:35,683
I don't know.

886
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:37,785
Right.

887
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:42,556
We'll get to the
bottom of this, Wolf.

888
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,858
I promise.

889
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:45,192
You better.

890
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:46,694
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

891
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:57,571
Okay, talk to me.

892
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:06,080
I'm entering the room.

893
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:07,615
Are you getting this?

894
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:09,083
Loud and clear.

895
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:11,052
And Jules...

896
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,256
Thank you.

897
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:19,226
All this time, and you never
knew there was another room?

898
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:22,363
The room was hidden.

899
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:23,264
How could they know it?

900
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:24,598
- Did I ask you?
- Hey!

901
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:25,699
Take it easy!

902
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:30,037
Now, let's just focus, okay?

903
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:30,905
- Fine.
- That's enough.

904
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,076
Jules?

905
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:37,211
Ben picked up the
sound of a crying kid

906
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:39,213
before he went up there.

907
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,915
Copy that.

908
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:53,260
That's a lot of toys for a kid.

909
00:59:53,294 --> 00:59:55,629
Maybe there was more than one?

910
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:58,332
[] Jules, are you sure
you gotta do this by yourself?

911
00:59:58,365 --> 01:00:01,969
Yeah, it's safer
for me if you stay downstairs.

912
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:05,372
We don't want anyone else
getting possessed like Ben.

913
01:00:05,406 --> 01:00:08,008
Look at these dresses.

914
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:51,886
This is the date.

915
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,089
1972.

916
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:56,824
This house was
built in the '70s.

917
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,966
It's a lot of uneaten candy.

918
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,134
Who gives a shit?

919
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:08,402
Are you pickin' up anything?

920
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:18,812
Nothing.

921
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:22,750
I'm not getting anything.

922
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:24,885
Would you try harder?

923
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:25,886
That thing attacked my brother!

924
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,921
Wolf, for fuck's sake, man,

925
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:28,055
will you take it easy?

926
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:32,359
Try harder, please.

927
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:41,735
What the fuck is goin' on?

928
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:43,003
There's no one up
there except her.

929
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:46,440
What the fuck is happening?

930
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:48,008
Jules, are you there?

931
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:49,276
Jules, can you hear me?

932
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:51,278
Jules?

933
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:52,880
Jules?

934
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:55,382
- Where's Martha?
- Jules?

935
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:57,818
Where's my wife?

936
01:01:57,851 --> 01:01:59,453
- Where's Ben?
- No, no, no, no, no!

937
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:10,532
Hey!

938
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:12,066
Come on.

939
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:13,535
Yeah.

940
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:17,037
Why can't you be quiet?

941
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:19,507
Forgive us of our
trespasses, huh?

942
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:20,908
Martha!

943
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,176
Will be done on earth

944
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:23,545
as it is in heaven.

945
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:27,348
Jules?

946
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,488
Martha!

947
01:02:38,158 --> 01:02:39,426
Jules?

948
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:43,998
Martha!

949
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:46,066
Martha!

950
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,502
Go help Ian, go help Ian!

951
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:50,137
Take this.

952
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,405
Jules!

953
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:52,540
Dammit!

954
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,475
Jules, can you hear me?

955
01:02:59,046 --> 01:02:59,880
Jules?

956
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:02,349
I'm scared.

957
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:06,020
As long as we stay in
the circle it won't escape.

958
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,223
Matty!

959
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:46,327
Matty!

960
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,629
Jules!

961
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:48,530
Jules!

962
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:49,863
Jules, can you hear me?

963
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:56,103
Martha, Martha, Martha?

964
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:57,505
- Ben?
- Is he here?

965
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:59,006
- Ben?
- Is she okay?

966
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,074
I want her out of this house!

967
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:38,379
Oh, shit!

968
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:39,980
You scared the
hell outta me, man.

969
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:42,449
You okay?

970
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:45,486
Wolf?

971
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,387
Wolf?

972
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,455
Annie, help me.

973
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,605
Wolf?

974
01:05:11,513 --> 01:05:12,346
Wolf?

975
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:15,583
Wolf?

976
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:27,995
Where's Ben?

977
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,196
Shh, I'm here, it's okay.

978
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,130
You're gonna be okay.

979
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:32,667
Wolf, where's Ben?

980
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:41,442
What happened?

981
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:43,711
Talk to me, man.

982
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:49,216
Come on, man.

983
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:53,755
He made me.

984
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:54,722
He made me.

985
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,024
Who?

986
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,260
Who made you do what?

987
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:04,666
The crucifix.

988
01:06:05,466 --> 01:06:08,703
He made me suck the crucifix.
- Oh, my god!

989
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:13,407
Ohh!

990
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:32,727
Get off me!

991
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,229
Don't touch her!

992
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:40,033
I will rape her soul!

993
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:52,346
This is my home, bitch!

994
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:50,838
In my hometown, those
tattoos were a custom

995
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:54,676
for our protection.

996
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,712
Everyone has one.

997
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:02,817
When it was my turn,

998
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:06,821
I begged a monk to let me go.

999
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,358
It hurt so bad.

1000
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:15,830
I fainted more than once.

1001
01:08:23,503 --> 01:08:25,305
My own mother held me down,

1002
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:26,874
so the monk could
finish his job.

1003
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:30,545
I was only nine.

1004
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:38,586
I have never believed
it worked until now.

1005
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:42,890
That's why you slept
through the first night.

1006
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:45,192
They can't touch you.

1007
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:06,848
So what now?

1008
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:21,596
Our sorrows and
wounds are healed

1009
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:23,731
only when we touch
them with compassion.

1010
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,369
Get the car keys.

1011
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:31,471
You and Annie are
gonna go find him.

1012
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:32,707
Who?

1013
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,608
My backup.

1014
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:13,514
Jules?

1015
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:14,381
He's here.

1016
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,318
Thank you so much for coming.

1017
01:10:20,855 --> 01:10:22,824
I see you have
chosen compassion.

1018
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:25,626
I had to.

1019
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,530
My abilities, they came back.

1020
01:10:30,665 --> 01:10:32,466
Of course they did.

1021
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:33,835
I give them back to you.

1022
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:51,018
There's no evil.

1023
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:54,522
There is only ignorance.

1024
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:57,992
When wisdom prevails,
evil ceases to be.

1025
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:03,330
Let us begin.

1026
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:04,932
Don't let go of the string.

1027
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,058
Show yourself!

1028
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:37,497
I'm not picking anything up.

1029
01:11:37,532 --> 01:11:39,466
I said, show yourself!

1030
01:11:47,675 --> 01:11:49,010
Nothing.

1031
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:50,812
No one's here except us.

1032
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:02,590
What do we do now?

1033
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,127
I don't know.

1034
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,596
They've been the one
initiating contact.

1035
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:11,999
They should be all
around us right...

1036
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:18,072
Now.

1037
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:49,837
Don't look at him.

1038
01:13:05,086 --> 01:13:07,420
Remember last night, Wolf?

1039
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,525
He's not your brother.

1040
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:15,162
We had so much fun.

1041
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,064
You're not my brother.

1042
01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:18,833
Not your brother?

1043
01:13:18,866 --> 01:13:20,635
You are a fucking piece of shit!

1044
01:13:20,668 --> 01:13:23,503
I'm wearing his filthy,
little, cocksucking soul!

1045
01:13:23,537 --> 01:13:25,573
Not my brother!

1046
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:30,144
You knew Mom was doing
all those things to me.

1047
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:32,546
What did you do?

1048
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,415
You stood and watched.

1049
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:39,787
What?

1050
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,055
I was just a kid.

1051
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:44,525
Did you like watching Mom

1052
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:47,161
do all those filthy
things to me?

1053
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:48,629
Don't listen to him.

1054
01:13:48,663 --> 01:13:50,197
It's not Ben!

1055
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:52,800
Martha.

1056
01:13:54,902 --> 01:13:55,970
Sweet Martha.

1057
01:13:58,272 --> 01:14:02,076
Ian, you know what I did
to your wife last night?

1058
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:05,079
She was so fucking sweet.

1059
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:08,916
So fuckin' sweet!

1060
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:19,026
Who are you tryin' to call?

1061
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,828
I'm here, goddammit.

1062
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:22,163
Wanna talk?

1063
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:24,699
I'm right fuckin'
here, you stupid slut!

1064
01:14:24,732 --> 01:14:25,733
Yes!

1065
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:29,770
There was no one
else in the house.

1066
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:31,105
It was just you...

1067
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,874
And me!

1068
01:14:35,009 --> 01:14:36,711
- Jules!
- Don't let go of her!

1069
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:41,949
There's somebody behind Martha!

1070
01:14:41,983 --> 01:14:43,250
There's a whole bunch of 'em!

1071
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:44,118
Shit!

1072
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:46,988
It's inside of her!

1073
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:58,132
I sense the anger from
the spirit within her.

1074
01:14:58,165 --> 01:14:59,066
Can you hear them?

1075
01:14:59,100 --> 01:14:59,967
What's he talking about?

1076
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,135
Who's he talkin' about?

1077
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:03,671
The spirits inside Martha.

1078
01:15:03,704 --> 01:15:04,705
They're trying to get out of

1079
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:06,607
whatever spirits are inside Ben.

1080
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,775
Who's inside Ben?

1081
01:15:07,808 --> 01:15:09,977
The one who killed us!

1082
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:16,250
Holy shit!

1083
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:21,989
Oh, my god!

1084
01:15:33,868 --> 01:15:35,002
You okay?

1085
01:15:35,036 --> 01:15:36,037
Martha?

1086
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:37,705
Martha, Martha?

1087
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:39,206
Honey?

1088
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,274
Hey.

1089
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:41,308
No!

1090
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:42,176
Oh!

1091
01:15:49,183 --> 01:15:50,785
- Help me, Ian!
- Martha!

1092
01:15:58,893 --> 01:16:00,194
Don't touch her!

1093
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,595
Yeah, no, wait, wait, wait!

1094
01:16:01,629 --> 01:16:03,731
Why?!

1095
01:16:03,764 --> 01:16:05,166
Why won't you see?!

1096
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:19,346
Jules, quick.

1097
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,315
Jules, please help her.

1098
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:22,349
Is this her?

1099
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:25,252
Why won't you see?!

1100
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:35,396
It's okay.

1101
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:40,701
- No.
- Annie, come here.

1102
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,203
Put it down.

1103
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:44,038
There's something
behind this wall.

1104
01:16:51,412 --> 01:16:52,313
Jesus!

1105
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:55,349
Are there any real
walls in this place?

1106
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:14,768
- Wolf, get the light.
- Yeah.

1107
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,775
What is this place?

1108
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:39,827
It's a projector.

1109
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:17,398
Oh, my god!

1110
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:56,203
They're not here.

1111
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:10,884
What the fuck was that?

1112
01:19:10,918 --> 01:19:11,952
Kuman Thong.

1113
01:19:13,988 --> 01:19:15,489
What the hell is Kuman Thong?

1114
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:18,560
The spirit of dead children...

1115
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:25,032
Taken from their mother
when they are not born

1116
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,003
to protect and
empower their master,

1117
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:31,872
the master of the house.

1118
01:19:34,509 --> 01:19:39,514
And in her, are the
spirits of dead women...

1119
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:46,153
Who's stolen children
now serve as master.

1120
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:51,425
That's what's inside
Ben, their master?

1121
01:19:52,993 --> 01:19:56,964
The Kuman Thong protect
their master and his house,

1122
01:19:58,499 --> 01:20:02,136
even after its
master is long gone.

1123
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:06,440
It's why I couldn't
sense anything,

1124
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:09,076
because they were
protecting him.

1125
01:20:10,944 --> 01:20:12,179
Nothing.

1126
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:17,217
He is now after a new
victim, a new child,

1127
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:19,253
to join his ranks.

1128
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:21,255
Why?

1129
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,458
None of this makes any sense.

1130
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:27,928
Martha's not pregnant.

1131
01:20:35,336 --> 01:20:36,170
Oh, god!

1132
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:56,490
All this time, all they
wanted was for us to see.

1133
01:20:58,092 --> 01:20:59,193
We've already seen!

1134
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:01,095
What else do they want?

1135
01:21:01,128 --> 01:21:02,496
Why won't they just let her go?

1136
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,168
Do we need to do
more than just see?

1137
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:12,272
Look who's here.

1138
01:21:13,608 --> 01:21:15,042
Go to the
first night we were here.

1139
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:19,446
All right, what
are you looking for?

1140
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,682
You fuckin' whore!

1141
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,416
Who do you think you are?

1142
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:25,452
Do you know
who you're fucking with?

1143
01:21:27,589 --> 01:21:29,089
It's right there.

1144
01:21:30,592 --> 01:21:32,594
There, you see it?

1145
01:21:32,627 --> 01:21:33,695
- No.
- Where is it?

1146
01:21:33,728 --> 01:21:35,028
See what?

1147
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:40,167
I'm gonna need a shovel, too.

1148
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:57,552
No, no, no, no,
you fuckin' bitch!

1149
01:21:57,585 --> 01:21:59,420
You fuckin' whore!

1150
01:21:59,453 --> 01:22:01,656
Ben, chill the fuck out.

1151
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:46,266
It's there.

1152
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,035
- Yeah.
- Dig right there.

1153
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,470
Okay.

1154
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:52,740
Huh?

1155
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:07,087
I got it.

1156
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:45,527
We found it.

1157
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,494
This is your big secret?

1158
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:49,631
You killed those women
to steal their babies?

1159
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:51,431
You don't know who
you're fuckin' with.

1160
01:23:51,465 --> 01:23:52,366
This is my home.

1161
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,201
You're in my fuckin' home!

1162
01:23:55,269 --> 01:23:57,104
You must lay them to rest now!

1163
01:23:57,137 --> 01:23:58,305
Jules.

1164
01:24:00,675 --> 01:24:03,545
The Kuman Thong have
been buried together

1165
01:24:03,578 --> 01:24:05,145
with their mothers.

1166
01:24:05,178 --> 01:24:08,148
Now, we can finish
what we started.

1167
01:25:06,874 --> 01:25:08,141
She's free now.

1168
01:25:09,811 --> 01:25:10,778
Martha?

1169
01:25:10,812 --> 01:25:11,646
Martha?

1170
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:15,717
It's okay.

1171
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:21,689
Ben?

1172
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:23,758
Hey, hey, you okay?
- What happened?

1173
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:26,894
Why am I tied up?

1174
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:35,435
Mom!

1175
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,342
- Hang on, hang on.
- You got it.

1176
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:43,343
We got it.

1177
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:44,211
Hang on, buddy.
- Come on.

1178
01:25:44,244 --> 01:25:45,613
You okay?

1179
01:25:52,854 --> 01:25:55,389
Ben?

1180
01:26:17,612 --> 01:26:19,747
Hey!

1181
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:21,214
You want me?

1182
01:27:13,735 --> 01:27:14,969
She's so sweet.

1183
01:27:15,002 --> 01:27:18,506
She tastes so fucking sweet!

1184
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:27,542
Is it over?

1185
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:02,877
Thank you for everything.

1186
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:03,945
Thank you for saving our child.

1187
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:05,445
Yeah.

1188
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:06,814
Have you guys been
thinking about names?

1189
01:29:06,848 --> 01:29:08,883
Well, we haven't really
talked about it yet,

1190
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:11,018
but-
- If it's a girl,

1191
01:29:11,986 --> 01:29:14,021
we were thinkin' maybe Jules.

1192
01:29:14,055 --> 01:29:17,992
Don't do that.

1193
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:19,060
Thank you.

1194
01:29:21,128 --> 01:29:23,698
Well, we should get goin'.

1195
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:25,498
Got a long road ahead of us.

1196
01:29:25,533 --> 01:29:27,134
- God speed.
- Thanks.

1197
01:29:27,168 --> 01:29:29,502
- And God bless.
- Thank you.

1198
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:30,370
Yeah.

1199
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:33,574
Annie.

1200
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:36,010
Where's the monk?

1201
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:37,745
- Oh, I'll get him.
- Okay.

1202
01:29:39,513 --> 01:29:40,413
Bye.

1203
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:41,949
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1204
01:29:43,517 --> 01:29:47,387
Sir, we're ready to go.

1205
01:29:49,123 --> 01:29:50,758
You killed her.

1206
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:55,830
Excuse me?

1207
01:29:55,863 --> 01:29:56,764
Your sister.

1208
01:29:58,633 --> 01:30:00,101
All those years ago,

1209
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:02,970
you killed her.

1210
01:30:15,016 --> 01:30:18,819
We're going to have
so much fun together.

1211
01:30:30,497 --> 01:30:33,234
And now, it has happened again.

1212
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,041
And now, you kill us all!

1213
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:56,857
Oh, my god.

1214
01:31:46,307 --> 01:31:48,809
Kill us all.

1215
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:16,570
And give us...

1216
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:41,295

so much fun together.
