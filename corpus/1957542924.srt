and I swallowed really quickly,

12
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,000
and half the mozzarella stick
got lodged, (grunts)

13
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,375
And the other one was still in my hand
with the connecting cheese,

14
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,708
and I had to have the Heimlich.

15
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,875
It was, like…
ruined the whole bat mitzvah.

16
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,875
Hi. Can I get another
Lover's Punch, please?

17
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,291
- WAITRESS: Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

19
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,625
These pancakes are bonkers.

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,458

- Mmm.

22
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,208
Have some of my steak.

23
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,250
- Great source of iron.
- Thank you, baby.

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,875
And, you know, you can
cook this at home really easily.

25
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:34,000
So you should do it a lot 'cause you never
remember to take your iron pills.

26
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,500
And your levels are… are really low.

27
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,750
Okay, what is this?

28
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,416
Like, are you trying to be the cutest,
sweetest, nicest boyfriend in the world?

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,166
Because… you're really winning.

30
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,625
Emma, I'm breaking up with you.

- Aw, thank you, honey.

00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,958
I'm glad you like it.
Everything for Toby, you know.

45
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,875

Hey, uh, Anne, have you seen
your nephew Toby anywhere?

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,708
I can't find this kid.

52
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,291
- Uh…
- (laughs): I'm up here, Uncle Peter.

53
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,583
I mean, I want to give him
his birthday present and all, but I think

54
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,041
- maybe he split the party or…?
- (laughs): Up here.

55
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,000
I mean, I just can't find him.
Do you have any idea where he is…

56
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,666
He's on your shoulders, Peter.

57
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,916
Oh, yeah?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,333
Oh, hey. Hi. (chuckles)

59
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,583
There he is.

60
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,125
All right, bud, go, go mingle.

61
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,625
It's your… your big day.

62
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,333
Is everything okay? You seem upset.

63
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,541
Me? (scoffs)

64
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,875
Ha. Yeah. No, everything's fine.

65
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,125
Everything's fine.

66
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,750
Okay, well, y-you're clearly not fine.

67
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,083
I mean, look, you just started

68
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,958
- full-on crying out of nowhere.
- (sniffles)

69
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,625
Let's just not talk about it right here,
Peter, okay?

70
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,958
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

71
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,541
I feel like, whatever it is,
you can just tell me.

72
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,416
Uh, it's gonna be weird
to go back to the party.

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,458
- You're crying.
- I want to break up with you.

74
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,416
What?!

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,416
Don't we have a really good time together?

76
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,958
We do. It's just not enough.

77
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,083
I… I'm ready for the next chapter
in my life, and…

78
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,666
You're still figuring a lot out.

79
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,750
Like what?

80
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,416
Your roommates are college students.

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,416
Okay. But they're very mature people.

82
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,916
And they're prelaw.
They're practically lawyers.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,958
You also don't even know
what you want to do with your life.

84
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:45,083
I… I think I'm just kind of,
like, doing it. (chuckles)

85
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,291
29 is the new 16.

86
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,416
You're 32.

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,791
Yeah, I mean, if you want to be,
like, a scientist about it, I'm 32.

88
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,333
Look, I met someone.

89
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,541
(sighs)

90
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,708
Why didn't you just say that
instead of making me eat your steak?

91
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,416
I mean, this just makes no sense.
It's completely out of nowhere.

92
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,916
ANNE:
Oh, no, it's not.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,708
I have been unhappy for a while, Peter.

94
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,416
Really? You have? I mean…

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,875
- Yes. Yes.
- You never said anything.

96
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,208
We're stuck.

97
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,625
No, what-what do we do?

98
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,000
We go to work and we make salmon
and we watch Dancing with the Stars.

99
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, come on. I…

100
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,625
We do stuff. We went to Wind Creek Casino
to see Rod Stewart.

101
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,916
Okay.

102
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,041
I was never supposed to be
an English teacher, Peter.

103
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,000
My sense memory professor said
I could've been the next Kate Winslet.

104
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,041
- You still could be.
- Not with you.

105
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,291
- (sighs) God.
- Oh, Peter, that's not... I didn't…

106
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,791
I mean, that is a really specific
and hurtful thing to say.

107
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,458
- Not with me?
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

108
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,541
Okay.

109
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,750
You're very…

110
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,416
Complacent, and it makes me complacent.

111
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,833
And I really wanted a big life.

112
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,041
Yeah, I wanted to study
commedia dell'arte in Florence,

113
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,833
and I wanted to do Shakespeare
at the Globe in London.

114
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,250
(Peter sighs)

115
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,458
Six years and we've never even been
out of the country together.

116
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,291
- But we did go see…
- Don't say Rod Stewart.

117
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:15,291
So, this new girl, is she, like,
really together or something?

118
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,541
I-I guess so.

119
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,541
I mean, she has this little pie shop
down the street from my gym and…

120
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,916
Cute.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,541
I don't know why that matters.
(clears throat)

122
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,208
What?

123
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,416
ANNE:
I'm sorry, Peter.

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,916
You are the last person in the world
I want to hurt.

125
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,541
I should…

126
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,416
I should probably get back downstairs.

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,666
Well, do you mind if I stick around long
enough to sing "Happy Birthday" to Toby?

128
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,208
Peter, I don't think that's a good idea.

129
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,875

316

- Mm.

317
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,791
But, uh, you know,
she wanted to be an artist

Pie's actually not that great.

327
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,333

You want to jump in on this with me?

00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,833
- I want to call Noah.
- Yeah.

355
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,208
Wh-What? No.

356
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,625
- Yeah, because it's, like…
- No, no.

357
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,333
-Oh, wh… hey, it fell all
the way right… -No. No.

358
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,416
- (sighs)
- Oh.

359
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,416
(over speakers):
Sir, I need you to return that phone.

360
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,625
No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,791
- I need to have it back.
- Okay, listen to me.

362
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,958
They dumped us, right?

363
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,541
- If they miss us, they'll call.
- (groans)

364
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,416
But they're never
gonna miss us if we call,

365
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,041
so we can't call
if we want them to miss us or call.

366
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,375
- Huh?
- I don't know.

367
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,166
I feel like Anne's just going through
something right now,

368
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,666
but any minute, she's gonna realize
she made a terrible mistake,

369
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,333
and then she's gonna take me back.

370
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,000
And I bet Noah will, too.

371
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,500
Yeah, I bet he definitely would
if I called him right now.

372
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,625
All right, look.

373
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,125
What about this?

374
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,750
It's a good plan.

375
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,875
- Hear me out.
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,208
How about, whenever we're feeling
like we really have to call them

377
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,500
- and we just can't take it anymore…
- Mm-hmm?

378
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,666
…Instead of calling our exes,
let's call each other.

379
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,875
Mm! I love that.

380
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,208
- Yeah?
- I love it

381
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,750
because we're intercepting
each other's sadness.

382
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,375
We're each other's sadness sisters.

384
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,291
Well, "Sadness Sisters" sounds like
you're Diane Keaton and I'm Meryl Streep

385
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,708
and we're in a Broadway play,
but I like it, yeah.

386
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,250
That's a great cast.

387
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,458

PAUL:
Okay, ready?

395
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,958
What is the minimum sentence
for first-degree assault

396
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:16,166
of persons blind, disabled or pregnant?

397
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,750
- Five years?
- Excellent.

398
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,458
- Very nice, babe. Good job.
- Mm.

399
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,083
Good job, babe.

400
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,541
Morning, roomies.

401
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,041
(groans):
Oh. Oh, God.

402
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,416
Is that a piece of Cinnamon Toast Crunch
in your hair?

403
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,541
- No, on the other side. Yeah.
- Oh.

404
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,000
So it is.

405
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,541
Another correct answer.

406
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,333

(Paul and Lisa chuckle)

408
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,291
Proceed. (chuckles)

409
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,541
Uh, just a quick reminder.

410
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,916
We're having this study group
over on Saturday, you know,

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,041
just in case you wanted to… not be here.

412
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,791
Oh, young man,

413
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,791
maybe I'll just stay here
in the apartment that I pay to live at,

414
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,666
but who knows?

415
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,958
- Who knows?
- (Lisa chuckles)

416
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,583
Land this thing!

417
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,500
Where the hell is The Virus?

418
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,375
EMMA (quietly):
Thanks for meeting me.

00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,416

00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,458
- (sighs)
- Don't be sad.

424
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,708
This isn't a sad movie, okay?

425
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,416
Nic Cage is gonna survive in the end.
We're not…

426
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,250
MAN:
Thanks a lot.

427
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,375
(whispering):
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Sorry about that.

428
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,750
Movie's, like, 25 years old.
I didn't think I could spoil it.

429
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,291
I'm not sad because of the movie.

430
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:40,333
I'm sad because Noah was
my airplane safety mask person.

431
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,750
Your what?

432
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,375
(sighs) My airplane safety mask person.

433
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,791
- What is that?
- (sighs)

434
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,500
Have you ever been on an airplane
and they play that video that says,

435
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,916
"Please secure your own oxygen mask
before helping others"?

436
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,791
Yeah, that's every airplane I've been on.

437
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,166
Well, I remember, when I was little,

438
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,833
thinking that,
if I were ever really in love

439
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,458
- and I was on an airplane with my lover…
- Hmm.

440
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,000
…that I would put his mask on
before my own.

441
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,791
When you were little, you used
the word "lover" in your thoughts?

442
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,291
(both laugh quietly)

443
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,125
Well, that's not the point.

444
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,625
- Well, it's kind of ridiculous…
- No.

445
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,166
…because you always put
your own mask on first.

446
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,708
No, you don't.

447
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,333
You're actually more helpful to others

448
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,125
once you're getting
a steady flow of oxygen to your brain.

449
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,125
- Oh, that's just…
- It's just logical, right?

450
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,875
You're actually putting your "lover"

451
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,041
- at greater risk…
- Why did you do that?

452
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,125
- Would you two shut the fuck up?
- …by not putting on your mask. Sorry.

453
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,791
(whispering): By not putting
your own mask on first, so…

454
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,333
No, but it's not about that.

455
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,875
- It's about romance.
- I don't mean for it not…

456
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,291
- It would be immediate that I can't…
- (laughs)

457
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,500
- It's all true.
- Yeah.

458
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,375
- All right. (sighs)
- (sighs)

459
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,791
You want to have lunch tomorrow?

460
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,500
Uh, yeah.

461
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,916
Yeah, that sounds nice. Let's do it.

462
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,666
- Okay.
- All right. See ya.

463
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

464
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,916
This is what I need.

465
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,250
I just need to see
what's happening with him,

466
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,708
and then…

467
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,958
- All right, let's just do it, right?
- Yeah.

468
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,708
Let's just rip off the Band-Aid and look.

469
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,416
- Let's just do it. Let's just do it.
- You got it. Okay, here we go.

470
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,833
Oh, my God.

471
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,875
Oh, no.

472
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,875
- EMMA: Jesus, this is, this is bad.
- Why?

473
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,416
This pie girl is really pretty.

474
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,041
Look at her muffins.

475
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,416
She looks like
she's really good at her job.

476
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,833
And look at her with my boyfriend.

477
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,916
They look so happy.

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,500
Hey, guys. I just wanted
to show you these pies I made

479
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,875
for Chrissy Teigen
and John Legend's anniversary party.

480
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,375
This is like a mean prank.

481
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,083
- I can't take it with this guy.
- (drops phone on table)

482
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,375
Look at that bio.

483
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,833
EMMA:
"Logan Santos.

484

485
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,750
Oh, you're a human man?

486
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,791
- Wow.
- Dude, that's awesome. What's that like?

487
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,791
I bet he's a chill hang.

488
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,708
"Come help paint sets for
Andrews Middle School production

- Oh.

490
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,041
Is he 14?

491
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,458
Andrews Middle School,
that's… that's Anne's school.

492
00:20:55,541 --> 00:21:00,625
So… so this guy is the drama teacher
at her school? Really?

493
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,875
Really? This is her living a-a big life?

494
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,750
Leaving me for
a middle school drama teacher?

495
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,750
Ooh, she commented on
this picture of him drinking coffee.

496
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,833
What'd she say?

497
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,791
Ugh, you don't want to know.

498
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,250
I think I do want to know.
What did... what did she write?

499
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,041
He's just drinking coffee
and it's, like…

500
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,250
- Well…
- …that kind of content.

501
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,208
- See, I feel like you're trying to protect me.
- I am.

502
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,583
But that's actually...
It's making it worse.

503
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,125
- Now I have to know what she says.
- No, you don't.

504
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,958
- Come on. Let me... Can I…
- It's just, like, not... It's not.

505
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,416
- It's not. It doesn't matter.
- May…

506
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,625
- I don't... It's a... Okay.
- Come on.

507
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,541
(sighs) She wrote kissy face,
kissy face, coffee cup.

508
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,166
Yeah, it's, like, stupid.

509
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,958
Oh, and he wrote,
"I miss you. Come back to bed."

510
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,916
(smacks lips)

511
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,166
- Wow, I…
- I'm sorry.

512
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,291
So she's, like, fully
in a new relationship.

513
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,375
Uh…

♪ She's some kind of wonderful… ♪

518
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,458
I can't do this.

519
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,166
I-I can't start over, you know?

520
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,041
I'm-I'm too old.

521
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,708
I'm too old. I missed the boat.

522
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,041
(stammers) All my friends,
they're married, they got kids.

523
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,250
- My one friend Dave, he's got a 12-year-old son.
- Mm.

524
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,916
Dave has a kid who's old enough
to have his own kid.

525
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,791
You think 12 years old
is old enough to have a kid?

526
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,333
I'm not saying it'd be a good idea.

527
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,458
I'm just saying Cody's
definitely gone through puberty,

528
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,833
- so his body's definitely producing semen.
- No.

529
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,875
- Biologically speaking, yeah, the semen's there.
- No, no.

530
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,166
- I need you to stop talking about…
- The babies are…

531
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,250
Don't do that.

532
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:31,500
The point is, at this rate,
I'm gonna wind up old and alone.

533
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,708
I'm gonna have no grandkids.

534
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,833
I'm gonna be eating Hint of Chicken

535
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,208
in one of the hellhole nursing homes
I helped create.

536
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,708
Oh, me, too.

537
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,083
I'm never gonna find a man
as kind and good as Noah.

538
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,500
Yeah.

539
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,708
He was the love of my life.

540
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,166
A-Anne is the love of mine.

541
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,500
And I feel like
I'm still the love of hers.

542
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,083
You know?

543
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,625
We can't give up.
We have to get them back.

544
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,541
(sighs) What?

545
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,291
It's just like you said.

546
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,708
- We know that we're supposed to be with Noah and Anne.
- Mm.

547
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,875
But I'm not so sure
that they're gonna realize it,

548
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,958
not with these shiny new people around.

549
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,583
So what are we supposed to do?

550
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,625
We have to…

551
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,541
(scoffs)

552
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,458
We have to break them up.

553
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,458
(laughs)

554
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,541
Well, that's crazy. We can't do that.

555
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,458
How would we do that?

556
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,041
PETER:
What if we follow Ginny around, right?

557
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,208
And-and we discover
all her dirty little secrets,

558
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:39,166
and then we slip them to Noah in, like,
an unmarked envelope or something.

559
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,708
What if she doesn't have any?

560
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,000
Then we create some, right?

561
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,750
Little Photoshop makes it look like
Ginny does fracking.

562
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,583
Oh, I would never date someone
if they did fracking.

563
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,750
Right? Yeah, no, me neither.

564
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,333
- What is fracking?
- I don't know, actually.

565
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:55,125
♪ ♪

566
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,416
I could tell Noah
that I'm pregnant with his baby.

567
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,208
All right. How's that help me?

568
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,666
You tell Anne
she's pregnant with your baby.

569
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,000
PETER:
All right, what if we do this?

570
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,166
All right, hear me out.

571
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,541
We send Noah a note from Ginny that says,
"Meet me at my grandmother's cabin

572
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,666
for a weekend of fishing,
maybe a little bit of fun."

573
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,416
But when he gets there, you are there,

574
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,291
-and you're lying naked
on a bearskin rug… -Oh.

575
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,291
…and you say,

576
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,750
"I knew you'd come."

577
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,041
What?

578
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,125
But he didn't know what he was coming to.

579
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,083
Mm, yeah, but it doesn't matter, right?

580
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,958
Because you seduce him very quickly before
he has a chance to get back to his car.

581
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,958
Which I guess would be pretty quick.

582
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,625
Okay, all right, you know, we'll file
this one under "work in progress."

583
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,583
Well, there is something there.

584
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,875
There is something there, right?
To the cabin.

585
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,208
No, the cabin is nothing.

586
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,416
I could seduce Logan.

587
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,666
- Whoa.
- And then Anne would find out

588
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,583
and she would get so upset of course,
and she would dump him

589
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,166
because she would be like,
"Whoa, I miss my ex-boyfriend."

590
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,041
- Me.
- "He was so nice and sweet,

591
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,875
and we had six years
and he never cheated on me once."

592
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:56,958
No, that's true. I never did.

593
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,291
And don't think I didn't have
my chances, you know?

594
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,791
- I don't.
- My dry cleaner was super into me,

595
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,041
- um, until she died of natural causes.
- Uh…

596
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,875
But, um, do you really think
you can seduce Logan?

597
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:10,375
I mean, I don't want to brag,
but, um, in high school, (chuckles)

598
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,625
I once kissed my married gym teacher.

599
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,916
And his wife was really hot, so…

600
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,583
Oh, no.

601
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,375
And it was, like, a whole thing.

602
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,875
Um, let's move past that.

603
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,041
All right, and then I could, too...

604
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,541
I could steal Ginny away from Noah.

605
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,000
(laughs)

606
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,791
Wh… Why are you laughing?

607
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,708
I'm not... I don't think I was laughing.
I…

608
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,333
You don't, you don't think I could do it?

609
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,333
I... Have you seen Noah,
what he's like and everything?

610
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,083
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

611
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,833
I mean, yeah,
he's a classically handsome guy,

612
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,000
but I-I, uh, I, uh, I offer a lot.

613
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,250
I think that you are somebody

614
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,375
that a person could fall
very deeply in love with.

615
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,208
Thank you?

616
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,958
- But it's more like slowly.
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,041
Over five or six months.

618
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,875
Okay.

619
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,541
Or like a year.

620
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:52,916
Two years tops.

621
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,875
Do you realize the number's going up?

622
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,583
Okay, I don't think
that you can get to Ginny.

623
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,041
You've made that perfectly clear.

624
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,791
But I do think that you could
become Noah's friend.

625
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,583
I could do that.

626
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,375
I mean, people like to be my friend.
I'm extremely affable.

627
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:10,416
You know, in college, all the girls
were like, "You're such a good friend."

628
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,958
Aw, darn it.

629
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,333
But-but-but the point is
people like to be my friend.

630
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,666
- Right.
- I get in his head.

631
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,916
You... that's exactly right.

632
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,250
You get in his head, and then you make him
realize that Ginny isn't that great.

633
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,875
- She's not that great.
- Yeah.

634
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:23,791
And that I am the one that got away.

635
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,000
Hey, do you really think we can do this?

636
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,583
- Yes, I do.
- I'm in if you're in.

637
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,625
I will seduce Logan,
you will friendship seduce Noah,

638
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,083
- and we will win back our people.
- All right.

655
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:23,291
Hi. Uh, am I in the right place?

656
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,583
Oh, uh, are you here to volunteer?

I am.

- Hi.

659
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,875
- Uh, Logan. (chuckles)
- Hi.

660
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,541
Um, which-which kid is yours?

661
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,625
(laughing):
Oh, no. I'm much too young.

662
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:36,958
And frickin' single.

663
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,375
Oh, I see.

664
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,833
- And, um, I saw your post on the Internet.
- Okay.

665
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:45,916
And, um, strangely,
I was in Little Shop, um, in high school.

666
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,416
- No way.
- Couple years ago.

667
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,291
You don't say. Who did you play?

668
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,125
Guess.

669
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Audrey.

670
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,083
Yes.

671
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,583
- I knew it.
- (chuckles)

672
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,916
And I just thought, "You know what?
I'm gonna take a risk,

673
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,541
and in that risk, I'm also gonna try
to give back to my community."

674
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,583
- Mm.
- And that's kind of where I was when I...

675
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:04,791
But also, that's weird.

676
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,875
If I'm just being, like, a weirdo...
Sometimes I just, like...

677
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:08,375
- I'm so impulsive and spontaneous…
- No.

678
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,791
- …and have sort of this big energy.
- No, no, no, no. Hey, no.

679
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,583
You're not weird at all.

680
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,291
You know what that is? That's admirable.

681
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,500
Thank you. That's really generous.

682
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,958
What do you do here?

683
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,583
Oh. I am the director.

684
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,666
Oh. (chuckles)

685
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,666
God, I feel so… that's… wow.

686
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,291
It's-it's actually
my-my first year teaching.

687
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:28,833
- Uh-huh.
- I was doing experimental theater before, back in New York and…

688
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:29,916
Ooh, New York City?

689
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,541
- Yeah, in the Big Apple.
- Wow.

690
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,791
Uh, hey, hey, hey!
That paint is for spraying, not huffing.

691
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,208
- Whuh-oh. Party time. (chuckles)
- These kids.

692
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,458
- Sorry, I have to go deal with this.
- No.

693
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,333
But why don't you jump onto
our papier-mâché team?

694
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,666
Oh, that's so beautiful. (chuckles)

695
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,750
- It's a little French. Um…
- Yeah, yeah. I heard that.

696
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,708
- But so good to have you, Emma.
- Oh.

697
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,291
Guys, guys, come on. We talked about this.

698
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,000
So am I for real doing papier-mâché?

699
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,166
(upbeat pop music playing over speakers)

700
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,458
NOAH:
Hey, man. Peter?

701
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,750
- Yeah.
- Hey, Noah.

702
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:02,875
Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

703
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,250
Hell. Ooh.

704
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,750
Wow, that's a firm handshake
you got there. (chuckles)

705
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,750
- We'll get you firm.
- Uh-oh.

706
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,125
- You ready?
- Uh, sure.

707
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,875
- Good. Let's go to my office.
- Oh, okay.

708
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,791
We're gonna strip you down,
get some befores.

709
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,208
Uh, okay. Uh, that's...

710
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,458
Wait. We're gonna what? (chuckles)

711
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:18,000
All right, you ready?

712
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,375
- Uh…
- Pop that shirt off.

713
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,000
I'd rather not. I…

714
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,958
- Come on. Pop it off.
- No, no. I just...

715
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,333
Maybe I'll just describe
what's happening to you and-and…

716
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,500
I'll tell you what.
I'll take mine off, too.

717
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,708
That's not gonna help me at all.

718
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,333
- (laughs) You're funny.
- Yeah.

719
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,333
Let's talk about anything
other than my body right now.

720
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,791
Uh, who's this?
You know, who-who you got here?

721
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,666
- Oh, that's my girl Ginny. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

722
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,083
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

723
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,666
- Girl pal or girl…?
- No, no, girlfriend.

724
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,916
Girlfriend? Oh, yeah.

725
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,708
And her little baby Pomegranate.

726
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,458
All right, last chance
before we hit the floor.

727
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:46,875
-Uh, yeah, I'm not taking my shirt off.
No. (chuckles) -Come on.

728
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,875
- All right, we'll get some anyways. One…
- Ah, I feel trapped!

729
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,875
- …two. There we go.
- I don't like this!

730
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,458
(dance music playing over speakers)

731
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,958
Keep your knees above your feet.

732
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,875
(grunts) All right.
Well, where else would they be?

733
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,291
(both chuckle)

734
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,916
So, uh, so you and-and this Ginny,

735
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,583
uh, uh, you guys been together
a long time or what's your deal?

736
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:03,833
No, no.

737
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,250
Well, I was in something serious,
and... I don't know...

738
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,541
- Now this is sort of a surprise, but… Come on.
- Oh.

739
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,916
- Oh, okay.
- Keep pushing.

740
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,916
-So, so really this is just
like a meaningless… -Come on.

741
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,208
…rebound kind of a, kind of a thang.

742
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,750
No, m-more, more like... I don't know.

743
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:20,750
We-We've known each other for a while,
and, you know, well, just kind of clicked.

744
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,250
- Oh.
- Come on. What was that?

745
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,125
- Uh, okay.
- Really?

746
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,333
But, yeah, she's the kind of girl
I could see going the distance with.

747
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,458
What about your ex?

748
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:31,875
I mean, did you ever imagine,
you know, going the distance with her?

749
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,500
Not exactly.

750
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,458
No, she... you know, she's great.

751
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,583
Really funny.

752
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,791
Was she funny? See, that's...

753
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,625
It's-it's important to remember
those things, you know?

754
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,875
(sighs) She just couldn't
get her act together.

755
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,375
- Ah, could she not?
- So it's a bummer.

756
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,500
- (grunts)
- Come on.

757
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,666
Yeah, push.

758
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,125
Push from your core, from within.

759
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,958
- That's gravity taking over now.
- Okay.

760
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,916
-That's... I'm going straight down.
(grunts) -Yeah.

761
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
- Single.
- (piano playing gentle music)

762
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:58,250
Switch up the rhythm. Solo, single.

763
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,708
Oh, my goodness, what are you looking at?

764
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,208
Whose mom are you?

765
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,250
- Nobody's.
- Then why are you here?

766
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,833
You some kind of pervert?

767
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,208
No, I'm not.

768
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,333
I'm here because
I love musical theater, okay?

769
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,041
Why are you here, narc?

770
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,583
Work detention.

771
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,541
Ooh. What did you do?

772
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,291
I put the class gerbil in a blender.

773
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,541
- Oh, my God!
- Not really.

774
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,791
- (groans)
- Skipped science for a week.

775
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,666
And they're making you
do this plant thing?

776
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,875
Ooh, the education system
in this country is a hot mess.

777
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,375
Woo-hoo! All my Skid Rowers.

778
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,708
- Come get hats and scarves.
- BOY: Nice.

779
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,333
- (fingers snapping)
- ANNE: There's plenty for everyone.

780
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,000
- (whispering): Hey.
- All right, slow down. Slow down.

781
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,000
What's the deal with her?

782
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,000
That's Miss Rivera.

783
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,791
She teaches English.

784
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,875
She does the costumes for the play
'cause she's banging Mr. Santos.

785
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,875
Oh, how do you know that?

786
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,750
Uh, Trevor, don't skimp
on the glue, please.

787
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,041
Thank you.

788
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,833
Yeah, Trevor, don't skimp on the glue.

789
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,791
I got to take five.

790
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,916
(clears throat)

791
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,250
- Hey, Logan.
- LOGAN: Yes?

792
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:12,166
Am I doing this right?
Because I just feel like it's so wet.

793
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,458
LOGAN: I-I think if you just
take your two fingers…

794
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,291
- Like... yeah. Okay.
- Yes, just like that.

795
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,541
- Yeah, you can... okay.
- And then we'll just let it drip out.

796
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,958
- Oh, thank you.
- Let it drip, yeah.

797
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:21,291
- Just-just... yeah.
- I don't think we've met. Hi.

798
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,708
- Oh. (laughs)
- Oh. (laughs)

799
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,416
Emma, this is Anne.

800
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,541
She's one of our English teachers here
and our costume mistress

801
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,333
and the mistress of my heart.

802
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,458
- Uh… (chuckles)
- (laughs)

803
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,541
This is Emma.

804
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,041
She came to help even though
she doesn't have a kid here.

805
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,208
Isn't that cool?

806
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,666
- It's definitely something. (chuckles)
- Right?

807
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,083
But, I mean, who wouldn't want
to help at a school musical?

808
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,208
So fun.

809
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,958
Fun?

810
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,083
(chuckles) It's more than just fun.

811
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,583
- Well, I was…
- You know, it's actually

812
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,333
really impactful, I would say.

813
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:52,000
It's serious.

814
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,583
You are exposing these young minds
to the power of theater.

815
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,458
Yeah, that's what I meant.

816
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,166
You know how serious
I take this production.

817
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,208
Yes, sorry. You're right, you're right.

818
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm-I'm a, I'm a little tense.

819
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,250
Maybe I should've just done
The Music Man like everyone said.

820
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,375
Stop it.

821
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:08,083
I love that you're pushing the envelope.

822
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,083
Maybe we can open a bottle of Barolo
and talk about it tonight.

823
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,375
- (whispers): I'd love that.
- (whispers): Okay.

824
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,125
(Logan exhales)

825
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:18,625
They seemed really into each other
but kind of in that way that's like,

826
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,666
"These people also
might murder each other."

827
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,500
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

828
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,500
So I volunteered for
a bunch more rehearsals.

829
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,666
I really think I can break them up
in, like, no time.

830
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,750
Ah, nice.

831
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,500
So what's he like?

832
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,625
- Logan… Logan's a lot.
- Really?

833
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:37,083
It's like, um, "You're actually directing
a middle school play, sir…" (chuckles)

834
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,666
- Yeah. (groans)
- "…not a production of, like…"

835
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,833
Can't think of a fancy play?

836
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,500
Is the movie Titanic based on a play?

837
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:48,666
- Mm, it's based on a ship.
- Yeah, I don't, uh…

838
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,875
Tell me about Noah.

839
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,750
Right. Um…

840
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,250
Well, I see why you like him.

841
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,208
I mean, the guy looks like a superhero.

842
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,791
Uh, he's charming, he's, um…

843
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,375
- I know all of this about him.
- (chuckles)

844
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,583
That's why I'm trying to, like…

845
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,666
- These are all things you know, huh? Um…
- Yeah, I just want to know, like,

846
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,958
did he say that he missed me
or something like that?

847
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,166
You know what he said?

848
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,375
He said that no one has ever
made him laugh like you did.

849
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,541
- Ugh.
- No, in a very positive way.

850
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,625
- Like…
- Funny girl.

851
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,750
- I would focus on the good.
- LISA: (moans) Oh, my God!

852
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,791
(Paul and Lisa moaning)

853
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,166
- Oh, my God, that feels so good!
- (Paul grunting)

854
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,791
- Okay, don't be alarmed…
- I'm not.

855
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,625
…but I believe there are people
having sex in your apartment.

856
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,333
- Yeah, I share that belief.
- What is that?

857
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,583
- (laughs): It's my roommates.
- What are you talking about?

858
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,250
- You live with a couple?
- Yes, I do.

859
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,875
I live with a couple of
broke college students who are in love,

860
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,750
and I can't pay for
this whole place myself, so…

861
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,750
You ever think about
getting a smaller place, you know?

862
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,916
- Something just for you?
- Yeah, sometimes.

863
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,375
- (Lisa moaning)
- PAUL: It's like we're the only people

864
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,458
- in the world right now.
- LISA: Oh, you are.

865
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,416
I did not mean to live here so long.

866
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,291
I moved in my sophomore year of college.

867
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,041
- I was gonna move out on graduation.
- Okay.

868
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,083
- And then my dad got sick again, and…
- Oh.

869
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,083
So I took the semester off
to kind of, like…

870
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm sorry, I-I didn't know
your dad is sick.

871
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,833
Uh, he was sick.
He had cancer for most of my life.

872
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,291
PAUL (moans):
Oh, that feels so good.

873
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,416
And then he died.

874
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,041
- Oh, my God.
- PAUL: Oh, my God!

875
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,541
- Here it comes! Here comes my love!
- (Lisa moans)

876
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,708
- Where do you want my love?!
- LISA: Oh, my God, everywhere!

877
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,708
(Paul moaning loudly)

878
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,750
- PAUL (sobbing): My God!
- (Lisa moaning)

879
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,500
That sounded like the finale.

880
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,375
- Yeah.
- And so what happened then?

881
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,166
Y-You never wanted to go back
and finish school?

882
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,333
Yeah, I did.

883
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:21,166
I just thought I would figure out
what I wanted to do with my life,

884
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,500
(chuckles):
and then I guess I never did.

885
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,583
(door opens)

886
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,000
- (Lisa laughing)
- Oh.

887
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,166
- Oh, whoa. I didn't know you guys were home.
- Oh.

888
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,500
Didn't know we had an audience.

889
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,375
I didn't hear a thing.
Did you hear anything?

890
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,083
- For... when?
- I didn't hear a thing, guys,

891
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,375
so you're-you're good.

892
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,541
EMMA:
Just out here chomping chips.

893
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,708
Gonna go get water.

894
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,041

- PETER: Mm.

895
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,041
So that's the crew.

896
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,500
- Yeah, it's time to move.
- (laughing)

897
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,000

Yeah.

958
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:57,916
My dad was supposed to pick me up,
but he probably forgot.

959
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,166
Oh.

960
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,833

Okay.

963
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:11,500
But just to be clear, I'm a safe person.

964
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,791
Normally, you shouldn't get in a car
with any, like, random adult,

965
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,166
especially if they tell you
that they're safe.

966
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,625
That's usually a sign
that they're not safe at all.

967
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:21,125
I mean, the first time
I went to a boy-girl sleepover,

968
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,958
it was at my friend Sarah's house.

969
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,666
And this boy Jonathan
brought all these videos,

970
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,541
and they played the scariest movie,
and then I had to call my mom

971
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:32,333
and tell her she forgot
to take me to the orthodontist,

972
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:33,708
but it was like 9:30 p.m. at night.

973
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,833
What are you doing?

974
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,541
Want a cig?

975
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,500
No, I don't want a cig.

976
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,666
And why do you even have cigs?

977
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,416
Aren't you like nine years old?

978
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,375
No, I'm in seventh grade.

979
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,833
I'm 12.

980
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,916
Are you stupid?

981
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,708
Okay.

982
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,916
You know what?

983
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,250
I get that being a kid is hard.

984
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,458
I really do get that.

985
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,833
You're greasy, you're horny…

986
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,666
I'm not greasy. You're greasy.

987
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,000
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

988
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,708
Let me just tell you,
I don't know you well,

989
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:05,500
but I feel like your whole
"I'm over the world" attitude

990
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:08,625
is maybe a little bit more than
just normal tween angst.

991
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:12,166
What's up?

992
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,208
My dad is having an affair.

993
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,583
Oh.

994
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:20,583
With a research librarian named Bruce.

995
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,833
Okay, so let me guess.

996
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:26,541
The dumb-ass kids in your class are
making fun of you for having a gay dad.

997
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,916
- No, my dad's always been gay.
- Oh, yeah.

998
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,833
- He cheated on my other dad.
- Of course.

999
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:33,291
He keeps trying to have
these deep talks with me about it,

1000
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,916
but I'm just like, "Fuck you, Dad.

1001
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,458
- Why don't you go do blowjobs on Bruce."
- Oh.

1002
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:41,125
Okay, well, first of all,
you don't do blowjobs.

1003
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,333
(stammers) No.

1004
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,250
(sighs) Being in love
is-is very complicated,

1005
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:49,875
and if your dad really does
love this man Bruce, then…

1006
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,250
You wouldn't get it.

1007
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,541
Your dad probably loves
having sex with your mom.

1008
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,416
Mm… well, my dad's dead,

1009
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,791
so he doesn't really have much sex
with anyone these days.

1010
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,875
Except for angels maybe.

1011
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,625
If he's lucky.

1012
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,416
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1013
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:10,416
Can I tell you a little secret
about being an adult?

1014
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:14,250
We're all just pretending
that we know what we're doing,

1015
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,083
and we're hoping that
we don't screw it up too badly,

1016
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,791
and then we're feeling really shitty
about ourselves when we do.

1017
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,875
So… (sighs)

1018
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,375
…why don't you cut
your gay dad some slack

1019
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:34,041
and, um, maybe try talking to him.

1020
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,958
♪ ♪

1021
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,291
- That's my street.
- Okay.

1022
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,875
But could you keep driving
a little longer?

1023
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,166
Mm-hmm.

1024
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,708
(quiet chatter)

1025
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,666
NOAH:
Yes!

1026
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,375
Good work, buddy.

1027
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,333
- PETER (panting): Oh, my God.
- (laughing)

1028
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,625
- (Peter groans)
- Whew.

1029
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,625
That was way… way further than you said.

1030
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,416
…tart, and I threw in
a chocolate cream mini pie

1031
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,125
- just for you.
- Hey.

1032
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,250
- Hi, babe.
- Ooh.

1033
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,958
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

1034
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,958
Uh, this is Peter, my new client.

1035
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,875
And also my new buddy.

1036
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:14,708
Oh, nice. Hi. I'm Ginny.

1037
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,791
Oh, hey.

1038
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,125
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1039
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,791
NOAH:
We were just in the neighborhood.

1040
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,750
Thought we'd try
one of those keto quiches.

1041
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,583
- Ah. Okay.
- I got to eat right now, you know,

1042
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:26,583
'cause he's trying to turn my body
from a ectomorph into a megamorph.

1043
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,708
Mesomorph.

1044
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,541
- Oh, a mesomorph. Right. Okay.
- Right?

1045
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:32,000
You guys want to grab a seat
and I'll get you something?

1046
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,041
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1047
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,666
Oh, buddy.

1048
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,583
- Whew! That was a big run.
- Gonna be okay?

1049
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,791
- No.
- (laughs)

1050
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,083
- This place is, um, really nice.
- Yeah.

1051
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,541
All righty, here we go.

1052
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,791
- Hey, thanks, babe.
- That is spinach and gruyere

1053
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,500
- with an almond flour crust.
- PETER: Oh, my God.

1054
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,500
Okay, this looks amazing. I'm gonna…

1055
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,750
Wo... Wow.

1056
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,083
- You're telling me this is good for me?
- Yes, sir.

1057
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,916
- I don't believe it.
- Thanks.

1058
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,416
- PETER: Yeah.
- Um, great to meet you, Peter,

1059
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
but I have got to get back to work.

1060
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,166
- Nice to meet you as well. Yeah.
- Thanks, babe. -Mm-hmm.

1061
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,791
Wow, huh. Yeah.

1062
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,375
- She's impressive, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1063
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,791
What about you?

1064
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:11,500
- You have a girlfriend?
- I did for a long time.

1065
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,875
But, um, she kind of ended things
with me recently.

1066
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:18,500
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1067
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,208
Uh, no, not really.

1068
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,125
It's... I just wasn't expecting it,

1069
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,375
so it's just a big adjustment, I guess.

1070
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,625
Yeah. That's a bummer, man.

1071
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,250
Yeah. Thanks.

1072
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,541
Well, you know what they say.

1073
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,666
You got to get back on the whores.

1074
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:35,708
Uh, I feel like you just said "whores."

1075
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:38,208
Yeah. Get back on the whores.

1076
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,875
Oh, no, well, the expression is "horse."

1077
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,666
Get back up on the horse.

1078
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,333
- No.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

1079
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,541
Why would you fuck a horse? (chuckles)

1080
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,833
You know, we... move past it.

1081
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,333
- But I get your point. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1082
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,041
I think, uh, it's an older expression,
too, so…

1083
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,458
Um… yeah, just... I don't know.

1084
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,041
I'm not ready for all that, but…

1085
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,541
Unless... I don't know
how you feel about this,

1086
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:07,375
but maybe you and I could
go out together sometime,

1087
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,750
like, 'cause I bet you're a great wingman.

1088
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,916
Dude, I'm a great wingman.

1089
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,625
- Yeah.
- (chuckles): Yeah. Mm.

1090
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:12,833
You been to Halo before?

1091
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,583
- No. What is that?
- I'm taking you, bro.

1092
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:15,875
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Oh, yeah?

1093
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,458
Yeah. My buddy manages the place.

1094
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,250
He can totally hook us up, bottle service.

1095
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,541
- Oh, so it's like a club? Like a…
- Yeah.

1096
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,250
Oh, that'd be nice.
I haven't been to a club in, uh, ever?

1097
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,625
I've had a couple wild nights
there myself.

1098
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,083
Uh, who would do that, like,
you and your ex or, like, uh…

1099
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,083
Yeah, we've shut it down.

1100
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,125
- You guys had some good times. Cool, mm.
- Uh-huh.

1101
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,500
- Mm! Babe.
- Yeah?

1102
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,791
You want to go to Halo
with us this weekend?

1103
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,875
Blech. No. Absolutely not.
(inhales sharply)

1104
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,083
I need a shower
just thinking about that place.

1105
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,125
But, you guys, go, have a guys' night.

1106
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,333
NOAH:
Yeah.

1107
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,208
- Guys' night. Yeah.
- PETER: Yeah, it's more fun anyway.

1108
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,375
- You know, it's like, uh…
- It'll be cool.

1109
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,875
Ooh, after this, we should, uh…

1110
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,458
We should run back to the gym, you know?

1111
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:54,291
Fuck no.

1112
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,833
So I guess I'm gonna be a club guy now.

1113
00:43:55,916 --> 00:44:00,291
You know, for a scummy nightclub,
that place is actually shockingly fun.

1114
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,666
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1115
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,625
We used to be, like, the last two people
on the dance floor.

1116
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,625
Oh, you know what's funny?
He said something just like that.

1117
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,625
Yeah, that you supposedly, y-you guys
would shut it down or something like that.

1118
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,583
- He did?
- Yeah.

1119
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:13,791
And I think this could work, you know?

1120
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,916
This is probably, like... it's just
what he needs to make him realize

1121
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,041
how much he misses you.

1122
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:21,375
And this dress is definitely
going to make Logan realize that

1123
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,208
he wants to take me out after rehearsal
for some drinks and some smooching.

1124
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,291
Okay, but won't Anne be at that rehearsal?

1125
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,708
No. She has parent-teacher conferences.

1126
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,583
- Look at you. Good work.
- Oh, yeah, man.

1127
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:32,875
I'm a psycho.

1128
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:37,458
(clears throat)

1129
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,625
Whoa.

1130
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,125
What? (chuckles)

1131
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,958
Um… uh, nothing.

1132
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,166
You look really good. Yeah.

1133
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,458
I mean, it looks great. Yeah.

1134
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:47,958
(chuckles):
I mean you look great.

1135
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,041
I know.

1136
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,125
(both laugh)

1137
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,041
Hey, what do we think about this, though?

1138
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,666
Does this say "night at the club"?

1139
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,375
Um… you look like Catwoman.

1140
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,833
And who likes the rum raisin?

1141
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,500
No one likes... I don't know.
I mean, a raisin?

1142
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,750
- You're gonna put a raisin in your ice cream?
- Mm-mm.

1143
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,583
- (woman whimpers)
- Hey! Hey, watch where you're go...

1144
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,083
Are you okay?

1145
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,625
- Can I help you with this?
- Yeah.

1146
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:07,791
- Here.
- Thank you.

1147
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,000
(chuckles) Here.
There's a nice table over here, madame.

1148
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,541
I see the perfect spot for you.
Look at this.

1149
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,083
We got good natural light,
you know, we're away from the hooligans,

1150
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,500
and look at these guys over here.

1151
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,416
You can soak in the eye candy
while you eat.

1152
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,250
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1153
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,875
It's not too bright for you?
You all right?

1154
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,583
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

1155
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:27,500
- What an unusual young man you are.
- (laughs)

1156
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:29,458
I was going for charming,
but I'll take unusual.

1157
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,791
- Enjoy your lunch.
- (laughs) Thank you.

1158
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,708
- You saved her from those skateboarders.
- (laughs)

1159
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:36,125
-That was… -I-I saved her
from the evil street hoodlums.

1160
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,833
- You're adorable.
- Eh, I don't know.

1161
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,250
I love old people.

1162
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,583
- Oh, man.
- Which is actually deeply ironic

1163
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:45,583
because I make a living
helping an evil corporation earn millions

1164
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:48,833
by malnourishing
sweet, helpless grandparents.

1165
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,291
That's kind of my gig, you know?

1166
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,375
Why do you work there
if you hate it so much?

1167
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,250
Well, it was supposed to be
temporary, you know.

1168
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,291
I got… I got a master's degree
in public health,

1169
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:03,041
and I was gonna revolutionize
the way this country treats their elderly,

1170
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:07,583
but, you know, instead I took
the first job I was offered, and…

1171
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:09,666
And I just stayed
because I was too chickenshit

1172
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,250
to lose my cushy salary
and my good benefits.

1173
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,875
Mm.

1174
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,250
Sorry, hold on.

1175
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:21,125
Your life dream was to revolutionize
the way that we treat old people?

1176
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,416
I mean, both my parents
worked all the time,

1177
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,583
and they'd stick me in my grandmother's
retirement home most days after school.

1178
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,625
And we had fun, but it was sad in there.

1179
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:31,541
You know? It was this ugly,
weird-smelling building

1180
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:35,000
where all these old people with
incredible stories and so much wisdom,

1181
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,375
you know, they eat terrible food,

1182
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,458
they watch bad movies on basic cable,
and they wait to die.

1183
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:40,708
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know, yeah.

1184
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:44,458
So I decided one day
I would open my own retirement home.

1185
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,625
Eh, some place that was, like,
affordable and cozy

1186
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,041
but somewhere where you would
actually like to wake up every day.

1187
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,708
That is so sweet and so weird.

1188
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,208
Okay, I can't tell
if you're making fun of me.

1189
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,458
- I'm not.
- (chuckles): Okay.

1190
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,875
I like it. I-I love your dream.

1191
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:01,250
Only I didn't do it, you know?

1192
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,083
And I became a part of the problem.

1193
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:05,333
Anne was right, you know? I…

1194
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:07,291
I am stuck.

1195
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:08,916
It's no wonder she broke up with me.

1196
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,708
Peter, stop. Stop it.

1197
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,333
- You're a total catch.
- Yeah?

1198
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,541
I mean, I do believe
you said I'm the kind of guy

1199
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,625
you could fall in love with
slowly after several years.

1200
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,000
You know, was it a hundred years?

1201
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,125
That's the best kind of guy, idiot.

1202
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,250
Anyone can be a one-night bang.

But the slow burn
who gets under your skin,

1204
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:28,583
that's way more rare.

1383
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,875
I really needed that, I guess.

1384
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,125
LOGAN:
Okay, wow.

1385
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,458
Um, everyone, let's-let's take five.

1386
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:45,041
Um, you… Okay.

1387
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,500
Um, Emma, that was, um…

1388
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:47,666
Really weird.

1389
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,916
Definitely not
what you were asking me to…

1390
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,166
I was going to say it was
an amazingly powerful interpretation.

1391
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,833
- Oh.
- Yes?

1392
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:55,458
- Yes.
- You were channeling

1393
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,375
all of Audrey's pain
and… and vulnerability.

1394
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,458
It was beautiful.

1395
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:03,625
Thank you so much.

1396
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,583
Uh…

1397
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:10,208
Would you like to have a drink after this
to celebrate how beautiful I just was?

1398
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:11,958
Absolutely. I would love that.

1399
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:14,125
Wow, great. (chuckles)

1400
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,583
Let me text Anne,
see if she wants to join.

1401
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:18,875
Yeah, well, I mean, she wasn't really part
of when I was beautiful before.

1402
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,416
(whispers):
Damn.

1403
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
(grunts softly)

1404
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,291
- You mind if I stick this...
- ("Yee" by Deorro playing)

1405
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:25,083
I-I'm gonna steal your chair.

1406
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:26,708
Oh, my God, I love this place!

1407
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:28,000
- It's crazy, you know?
- (whoops)

1408
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,958
I feel, like, Italian or something.

1409
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:34,958
Yeah. You are so adorable.

1410
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:36,583
- Ah, get out of here. Thanks.
- No, no.

1411
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:41,166
You remind me of that little
singing, uh, cartoon gerbil.

1412
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,125
Oh, what is his name?

1413
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,166
Alvin the Chipmunk?

1414
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,333
- Yes! Yes!
- Okay. (laughs)

1415
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:49,083
Oh, I love that little guy.

1416
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:50,500
This bottle's dead.
Should we get another one?

1417
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,541
No, this place is lame.
Let's get out of here.

1418
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,708
Oh, well, okay, well, get home safe.
Nice meeting you and, uh…

1419
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:57,041
No, no, no, no. She meant all of us.

1420
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,625
Yeah, we can go back to our place.

1421
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,708
Oh, yeah, uh… that sounds fun.

1422
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,416
Let… let me talk that over
with my friend really quick just to…

1423
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,291
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1424
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,166
Grab your things.

1425
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,208
Uh…

1426
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:13,375
What? What?

1427
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:14,708
You got to go.

1428
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:15,916
I'm gonna go, yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?

1429
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,916
- You're gonna come with me, though, right?
- I can't.

1430
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,166
- I shouldn't.
- Why not?

1431
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,291
Well, you know, Ginny…

1432
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,083
Come on, man.
You promised to be my wingman.

1433
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,208
I can't go alone.

1434
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,833
I won't let you do anything stupid.

1435
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:27,500
I just... I need my wingman, right?

1436
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,708
I'll do it for you. Let's go.

1437
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,125
- (laughs) We're in!
- But I got to be good.

1438
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,000
- No, yeah. You're Mr. Good.
- Yes! -Yes?

1439
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,375
- Here he comes! We're in! Yeah!
- (cheering)

1440
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:40,458
So, after Virginia Woolf,
we're planning on going to Europe.

1441
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,583
- LOGAN: Yes, yes.
- Ooh.

1442
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,250
I've just been dying to study
commedia dell'arte in Florence.

1443
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:45,583
- EMMA: Oh.
- Oh, yes.

1444
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:48,125
- I love, love, love Firenze.
- Yeah.

1445
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,666
What a nice way to say that.

1446
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,708
- The food, the wine…
- Ah. Yes.

1447
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,041
…the women.

1448
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,291
Uh, just for looking, of course.

1449
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,500
(Logan chuckles)

1450
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:00,250
She, uh, gets a little jealous.

1451
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:03,458
ANNE:
What? I don't get jealous.

1452
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,041
LOGAN:
Uh, did I say "jealous"?

1453
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,000
- No, no, no. I-I meant…
- (laughs)

1454
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,083
I am having the best time with you guys.

1455
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,958
(sighs) Me, too.

1456
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,750
And hold on one moment
while I just give myself

1457
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:17,041
a dose of liquid courage here, but, um…

1458
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,708
(chuckles) Sorry. I…

1459
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,541
Mmm. Okay.

1460
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:24,375
I find you both to be…

1461
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:27,500
…incredibly attractive.

1462
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:30,708
- Hmm.
- And, um…

1463
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:34,625
I'm wondering, uh,
how you would feel about me,

1464
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:37,750
sometime, maybe…

1465
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,208
Joining you in your bed.

1466
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,458
- Oh, wow.
- (Emma chuckles)

1467
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:44,666
Wow.

1468
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,166
(Emma and Logan chuckle)

1469
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:49,333
Um, well, first of all,
thank you for sharing that.

1470
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,458
You're welcome.

1471
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,750
Um, to be honest, I was expecting this.

1472
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,833
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1473
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,125
It's definitely something I'm open to.

1474
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:59,000
I've had quite a few threesomes in
the past and some really great memories.

1475
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,166
- Yeah.
- Uh, but, Anne, Anne, um…

1476
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,000
- What do you think?
- Mm. What do I think?

1477
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,791
Yeah. Uh, well, I mean,
you are always saying

1478
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,000
that you want to explore
new parts of yourself.

1479
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:10,083
- (chuckles) -Right?
- ANNE: No, I want to.

1480
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,458
You're right. I've been talking about...

1481
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:13,291
We've been talking about it,
and so I do, I want to.

1482
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,791
- Wow.
- But not tonight

1483
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,708
'cause I haven't, liked,
shaved or anything in like…

1484
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:19,000
Great, then how about next weekend?

1485
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:20,458
Opening night of the musical.

1486
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:21,750
- Yes.
- We can celebrate.

1487
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,000
To celebrate, yeah.

1488
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,041
Yeah, sure.

1489
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:29,416
Let's all have sex to celebrate
middle schoolers. (laughs)

1490
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,041
- PETER: Yeah.
- TAYLOR: This is where we live.

1491
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:33,125
- Wow.
- NOAH: Wow.

1492
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:34,208
CHLOE:
You want to come sit with us?

1493
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:36,875
- Hop on.
- NOAH: I'll just maybe

1494
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,916
stand up, stretch a little.

1495
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,666
- Yeah. -What? We don't bite.
- Unless you want us to.

1496
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,625
This is, uh, this is a really nice place.

1497
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45,375
What is it you do for work again?

1498
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,250
Uh, Chloe is a clothing designer.

1499
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,916
- Taylor and I work in PR.
- PETER: Wow.

1500
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,416
Who wants shots?!

1501
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,875
- (others whooping, cheering)
- Oh!

1502
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,041
- Yeah, Noah, we should do one together.
- Shot, shot, shot. -Okay, yeah.

1503
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,541
- Sure.
- All right. Okay.

1504
00:59:56,625 --> 01:00:00,250
Hey, to our hot new friends.

1505
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:02,041
All right. I guess that's us. (laughs)

1506
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,000
(others whooping)

1507
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,041
Knock-knock, motherfuckers!

1508
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,666
Oh, Jesus, you invited
Jase and the guys over?

1509
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,041
He has Molly.

1510
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yay, you're here!

1511
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,333
(excited chatter)

1512
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:16,000
- (laughing)
- (chuckles nervously)

1513
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,625
Who are the old dudes?

1514
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:19,958
These are dope.
I got these from my brother's stepdad.

1515
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:21,791
- Ooh. -Yes, sir.
- JASE: Yeah, yeah.

1516
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:24,041
- So your stepdad?
- Nah.

1517
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,583
- Oh.
- Mm.

1518
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:26,791
All right, enjoy.

1519
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,541
Uh, hey, man, have you,
have you done Molly before?

1520
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,875
- Not since Stagecoach.
- CHLOE: Take it.

1521
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,250
- Come on!
- Come on!

1522
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,958
(others cheering)

1523
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,833
LEIGHTON:
Let's go dance!

1524
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:37,000
- (others whooping)
- Yeah!

1525
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:38,125
Here's nothing.

1526
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:39,333
- All right. All right.
- Come on. Come on.

1527
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:40,500
- Oh, where we going?
- That's right, do that.

1528
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,958
So, uh, you and Leighton, huh?

1529
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,041
That's-that's cool, that's cool.

1530
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:45,250
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah. Oh, I don't know. Yeah.

1531
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,750
Yeah, well, she used to be my girlfriend.

1532
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,833
- Oh, um…
- Yeah.

1533
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,083
Uh, cool. Well, you know what?

1534
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:52,291
I-I actually just met her,
so I don't really…

1535
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,875
(scoffs) That's-that's cool, man.

1536
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,125
- Yeah, nothing's really happening.
- That's cool. That's cool.

1537
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:56,583
So she ever mention me, like?

1538
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:59,416
Uh, well, uh, you know,
I've only known her for like two hours.

1539
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,041
Oh, so that, so that's a no.
Okay, okay, cool.

1540
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,125
- Yeah, it's a no because…
- No, it's cool.

1541
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:05,250
I haven't seen her since
she actually, like, broke up with me.

1542
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,458
- Yeah, so…
- Okay, so this is fresh.

1543
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,000
- It-it wouldn't have worked out anyway, you know.
- Ah.

1544
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,875
We, uh, we had different love languages.

1545
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,041
- You know.
- Sure, you know.

1546
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:15,625
Um, hey, you, uh,
you didn't take your pill, man.

1547
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:18,208
Oh, yeah. You know, um,
I've-I've never done Molly, so…

1548
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,666
- Okay.
- I don't know.

1549
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,000
Like, is my heart gonna explode
if I, uh, take this?

1550
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,208
(laughs):
Oh, no, no.

1551
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,416
You're thinking of crack, bro.

1552
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,791
- That's what it was.
- You're fine.

1553
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,291
- Just pop it. You're cool, man.
- Yeah. Okay.

1554
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,166
- Here we go. Down the, down the hatch.
- Yeah. To Leighton.

1555
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,291
Huh?

1556
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,000
The love of my life.

1557
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:35,500
(dance music playing in distance)

1558
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:39,500
I can feel my heart beating in my eyes.

1559
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,166
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1560
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,666
- If I'm being perfectly honest…
- Mm-hmm?

1561
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,291
…I can smell the moon right now.

1562
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,208
- No. (inhales deeply)
- Which I didn't know was a thing.

1563
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,458
You know, I bet this is
what it's like to be a dog.

1564
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,125
- Oh, man, yeah.
- JASE: Yo!

1565
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,666
- Yo!
- (Leighton gasps)

1566
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,458
- Where's my buddy?!
- Uh, what is that?

1567
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:57,750
- What is that?
- Yo, where's my new friend? -Whoo.

1568
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,416
- Peter? -(gasps)
- Whoa.

1569
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,833
- Oh, there he is.
- Hey.

1570
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,583
- Peter!
- What are you doing, man?

1571
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:04,666
Don't worry, don't worry.
We do this all the time.

1572
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,291
No! No.

1573
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,375
Y-You're not gonna make it
in the pool from there.

1574
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,708
The pool? I'm not jumping in the pool.

1575
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,458
I'm jumping in the hot tub, dude.

1576
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:13,625
I'm tub jumping!

1577
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:15,208
Oh!

1578
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,333
No!

1579
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:18,208
- LEIGHTON: Yes.
- There's not enough water in there, man.

1580
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,666
- Don't do it.
- Do it.

1581
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,291
- Do not do it.
- Do it.

1582
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,000
It's what Leighton wants. I got to do it.

1583
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,083
You heard her.

1584
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,166
Look, hey, look, we've all had
a lot of fun tonight, you know,

1585
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,916
but maybe just step back down.

1586
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,125
I think they got Scrabble inside.
Let's just…

1587
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,416
- Tub jump!
- No, no, no, no.

1588
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,458
- No! No, no, no! No.
- LEIGHTON: Yeah! (whoops)

1589
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,041
(both gasp)

1590
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:39,041
- Is he dead?
- Maybe.

1591
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,333
Tub jump!

1592
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:43,166
Trust me. It's totally safe.

1593
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,375
Okay.

1594
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:47,375
As long as you, like, tuck your knees in
and protect your neck.

1595
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,666
- Protect my neck? Holy shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1596
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,750
What happens if you miss?

1597
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,458
Oh, no, do not miss.

1598
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:54,583
- I can... I cannot bleach blood out of the patio again.
- Oh, shit.

1599
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,125
- MAN: Tub jump!
- Whoa, you all right?

1600
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,666
- (water splashes) -LEIGHTON: I'm okay.
- Whoa, there he went.

1601
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,750
- (whoops) Come on, let's go!
- There he goes.

1602
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,791
Pop that shirt off!

1603
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:02,916
- All right.
- (laughs)

1604
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,541
Why's everyone always want me
to pop my shirt off?

1605
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,416
Hi! I'm coming!

1606
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,041
And where is Noah?

1607
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,666
This couch is everything.

1608
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,291
- I could be your everything.
- Hi.

1609
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:13,458
- Oh. Hi. (chuckles)
- (chuckles)

1610
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:15,041
- Where did you come from?
- (laughing)

1611
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,416
- Do you want to dance?
- (gasps) Oh, my God, we should dance.

1612
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,583
I love to dance.

1613
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,041
Ooh, that's far.

1614
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,833
- JASE: Jump! -MAN: Come on!
- LEIGHTON: You'll love it. -Okay.

1615
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:23,791
- Come on, Peter! You can do this!
- Come on! -You got it!

1616
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,708
- It seems very shallow.
- MAN: You got it!

1617
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:27,041
PETER:
I'm gonna go for the pool.

1618
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:28,583
OTHERS:
No, no, no, no, no!

1619
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:30,208
Do not go for the pool, okay?

1620
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:31,625
That's how Miles got hurt.

1621
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,083
- He's in a wheelchair now.
- Yeah.

1622
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,208
Is he?

1623
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,625
- Yeah. -Yeah.
- Okay.

1624
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:36,875
- MAN: Jump! Jump!
- I can't believe that you'd rather

1625
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:38,125
be with this guy than with me.

1626
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,250
- Jump, Peter! -This is ridiculous.
- MAN: Jump!

1627
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:42,083
By the way, I haven't achieved
my workout goals yet. I…

1628
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,625
Can we just talk about this later?
It's fine.

1629
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,291
No, let's talk about this now,
while he's up there.

1630
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:46,625
You guys are on your own thing?

1631
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:47,791
- 'Cause I can go back.
- LEIGHTON: Come on!

1632
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:49,125
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
- No, no, no, no!

1633
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,333
- Okay. No? Stay out?
- Come on! Come on!

1634
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:51,791
- No, you can do it! -Jump!
- Okay. All right.

1635
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:54,666
- GROUP (chanting): Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
- All right. Ooh.

1636
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,291
- I love you. I love you so much.
- (chanting continues)

1637
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:57,583
I love you so much, Leighton.

1638
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:59,166
- Shut up.
- Just please give me another chance.

1639
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,958
- Whew.
- Please. I'll stop stealing from you.

1640
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,500
- Whatever you want.
- I'm doing it.

1641
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:03,750
Here I go.

1642
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,666
(whoops)

1643
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,791
(cheering)

1644
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:10,708
(whooping)

1645
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:13,791
I'm alive! I'm alive!

1646
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:16,416
- Oh, my God, I can't believe I did that!
- (laughing)

1647
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,666
(panting) Whoa!

1648
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,791
Oh, my God.

1649
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:20,833
I mean, Anne thinks
I never do anything spontaneous.

1650
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:21,958
You know what I mean?

1651
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:24,500
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, she hated listening to me complain about my job,

1652
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,041
always eating the same salmon

1653
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,666
and pretty much everything else
about our life together.

1654
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,041
-But, you know, I think things are
gonna be different now… -Uh-huh.

1655
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:31,250
…'cause I just jumped into a hot tub!

1656
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,375
I mean, thank you so much.

1657
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:35,375
Yeah, no, you're-you're totally welcome,

1658
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:38,666
but, um, like, who's Anne? (chuckles)

1659
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,166
- Hang on a second. Uh…
- Yeah?

1660
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,125
What PR firm did you say
you worked at again?

1661
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,958
Oh, we work at Goldman Personal Research.

1662
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,875
Th-That is, that is not
what "PR" stands for.

1663
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,416
That's not even close.
Oh, my God, how old are you?

1664
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,791
Twenty-three.

1665
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:56,833
How old are you really?

1666
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,666
Okay, fine, I'm 19.

1667
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,250
(Leighton laughs)

1668
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,166
- I'm-I'm 17.
- Oh, my God.

1669
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,166
- Oh, my God! Noah, they're in high school!
- Okay.

1670
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,875
- (vehicle approaching)
- Oh, fuck, my dad's home!

1671
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,875
Oh, shit! Her dad sucks!

1672
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:12,000
PETER:
Noah!

1673
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:13,750
- Oh, my God. See, I knew this house was too nice.
- (mutters) Oh, shit!

1674
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:16,125
- Noah, these are children!
- Oh, my God!

1675
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,000
- (dance music playing)
- PETER: Noah!

1677
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,875
You took your shirt off.

1678
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,458
Yeah, I took my shirt off. They're 17!

1679
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,708
- 17 what?
- Years old, man! We got to go!

1680

Get your shit! Go, let's move!

1682

Uh… hello.

Don't be mad, Daddy.

1686

How old are you?

1687
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:39,208

- You're 17 years old?

- No, no, no.

1691
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,708
- Well, okay, first of all…
- We didn't know how old they were.

1692
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:47,833
We did not.

1693
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:48,958
- NOAH: No.
- Okay, and…

1694
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,083
- NOAH: They tricked us.
- They did trick us.

1695
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,208
NOAH:
Just tell him the truth.

1696
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,958
- Just tell him the truth.
- Here's the thing. (stammers)

1697
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:54,916
I want what you have in life, you know?

1698
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,583
Uh, I want your house, you know?

1699
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:57,791
You want my house?

1700
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:59,083
I want a daughter, you know?

1701
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,791
Um, not your daughter. I want a daughter.

1702
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,333
You know, like-like a little girl,
you know?

1703
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,583
I'm sorry, what?

1704
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,000
- Even a little boy would be fun to play with.
- Okay…

I want your daughter to be my daughter.

Everyone, just calm down.

- Yeah.
- All right?

1711
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,666
I'm calm.

Dude, your stamina's really improved.

with Leighton.

I really wanted that for you.

1721
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:40,250
Yeah, well, she was in high school,
so that's probably for the best.

01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,583
Yeah.

back there with those girls.

1726
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,541
Oh, yeah?

1727
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:56,666
Well, you know, maybe that…

1728
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,958
Maybe that means you're not ready
to settle down just yet, huh?

1729

No.

1730
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:03,833
No, if anything,
tonight was a major wake-up call.

1731
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,958
-I mean… -Tonight was a wake-up call.
I'll give you that. (chuckles)

Holy shit.

about, you know, wanting a daughter…

I was talking off my head.

I'm ready for all that.

1742
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:33,750

2012
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:37,583
Oh, thank you.

2013
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:39,000
You're like a dermatologist's dream.

2014
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:40,083
- (chuckles) Thank you.
- (chuckles)

2015
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,625
- What about my dress?
- Oh, yes.

2016
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:44,166
-Let me, uh… -But I'm still
wearing all my clothes, so…

2017
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,750
Oh, you know what?
Lucky for you two, I am ambidextrous.

2018
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,333
- Oh.
- Okay.

2019
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:50,458
Oh, there you go.
And, uh… (inhales sharply)

2020
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:51,583
Need to feel it out.

2021
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:53,666
Uh, okay, maybe just one at a time.

2022
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,125
- Yeah.
- There we go. Okay.

2023
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,583
Okay, you working on that.

2024
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,250
I can't wait to see what else
these fingies can do, right?

2025
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:00,375
- And there we go.
- Ah.

2026
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:01,916
There it is. (laughs)

2027
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,250
You did it.

2028
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,708
(sighs, chuckles)

2029
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,708
Okay, well, this is heating up, I think.

2030
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:09,916
Um, shall we move this ménage
to-to the bed?

2031
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,083
Or we could dance for you.

2032
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,000
Yes. Yes.

2033
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,250
- Let's dance for you!
- Oh, okay.

2034
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:17,750
Alexa, play anything!

2035
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,083
(sighs heavily)

2036
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:22,916
(front door opens, closes)

2037
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,375
(footsteps ascending stairs)

2038
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:29,583
(sighs)

2039
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:33,125
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

2040
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,541
Hi.

2041
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:35,750
(both chuckle)

2042
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:37,583
It's like a fire hazard in here.

2043
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:39,500
- What's going on?
- (chuckles)

2044
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,833
Well, what's happening is…

2045
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:44,125
Whoa, whoa.

2046
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:46,000
…I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

2047
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:48,250
Will you marry me?

2048
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:50,583
♪ ♪

2049
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,666
It's… it's really fast.

2050
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,791
I know.

2051
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:57,500
But I-I feel like we've been together
long enough for me to know

2052
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,458
all the important stuff.

2053
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:02,958
Like I want to fall asleep
next to you every night,

2054
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:04,833
and I want to wake up
next to you every morning.

2055
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:10,041
And, uh, I want to be
the first person to try

2056
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:12,833
all your new pie flavors

2057
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,875
just so I can see the look
on your face when I tell you

2058
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,375
how amazing they are.

2059
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:19,750
Uh… (sighs)

2060
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,416
I'm screwing this up. I-I-I…

2061
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,875
(both chuckle)

2062
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,375
I love you so much.

2063
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,916
And I, uh…

2064
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,958
I-I just never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

2065
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:42,875
So?

2066
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:45,833
(chuckles nervously)

2067
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,416
Yes, of course.

2068
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,041
- (whispers): Yes?
- Yes, I will marry you.

2069
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:55,666
(both laugh)

2070
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:59,000
I know. I just, uh… Ah.

2071
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,333
- Supposed to put this on.
- Oh, my God.

2072
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,708
Oh, shit.

2073
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,375
(gasps)

2074
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:05,583
Oh, my God.

2075
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:08,375
- Mm.
- I love you so much.

2076
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:10,166
I love you, too.

2077
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,791
- Yeah.
- We're getting married.

2078
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:13,916
- (laughs, pained grunt)
- (laughs)

2079
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,625
Yes.

2080
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,208
Mm, yeah.

2081
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:19,625
(both grunt, chuckle)

2082
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,708
Stupid pants.

2083
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,208
(Ginny laughs)

2084
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:29,125
NOAH:
There. (chuckles)

2085
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:31,208
(R&B music playing)

2086
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:36,833
- (sighs)
- (music ends)

2087
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,583
Oh, I-I think that is... that's the end.

2088
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:40,375
One more song?

2089
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:42,416
- One more song. -(sighs)
- Uh, really?

2090
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,500
Uh, it-it feels like you've been
dancing for-for a while now.

2091
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:46,833
(sighs):
Okay. All right.

2092
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:48,416
- Anne.
- Hmm?

2093
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,500
I think it's time.

2094
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:51,166
It's time, yes.

2095
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,041
- I think it's time for us to all have sex together.
- ANNE: Yeah?

2096
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:57,708
- Sure. Yeah.
- Come on. Yeah.

2097
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,791
Okay, let's do it.

2098
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,291
May I, uh, take off your pants?

2099
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,500
- Oh, yes. Yeah, ple... yeah, of course.
- Yeah. Okay.

2100
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:06,000
- LOGAN: Get-get these... It's just these buttons.
- Oh. Oh.

2101
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:08,541
- Just lift your butt, I think.
- Okay, yeah.

2102
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,458
- Okay.
- Um, maybe... Wow.

2103
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,083
Snug little… little guys, these…

2104
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:13,916
- LOGAN: Maybe one at a time.
- Yeah, one at a time.

2105
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,125
- Okay.
- Oh, yay.

2106
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:16,416
- (laughing): Wow.
- (sighs)

2107
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,708
- That was really difficult.
- (chuckles) It was.

2108
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:20,833
Anne, come on.

2109
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,416
- Yeah, Anne.
- Join us.

2110
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,958
(panting)

2111
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,708
Yeah, j… just a sec.

2112
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:29,250
I... you know, I'm just, um,
I'm just trying to figure out this, uh...

2113
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,750
Ooh. (chuckles)

2114
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:32,125
Here, get this dim right.

2115
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,416
How's that? You like that?

2116
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,750
Uh, Anne, what's-what's going on?

2117
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:38,291
- What do you mean?
- I mean, do-do you not want to do this?

2118
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,625
I thought this was something
that you wanted to explore.

2119
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:43,833
- It is.
- Okay, well, then let yourself be free.

2120
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:44,958
- Right?
- Yeah.

2121
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:48,000
I mean, you're not with your boring
old boyfriend anymore, right?

2122
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:49,291
I never said he was boring.

2123
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,041
No, no, but you mentioned that he's, like,
the human equivalent of toast.

2124
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:54,791
Yeah, but I love toast.
I mean, who doesn't love toast?

2125
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:55,875
Everyone loves toast.

2126
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:58,750
It goes with everything and
it makes you feel all good inside, and…

2127
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:01,458
Peter is not that boring.

2128
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,000
He's not the worst at all.

2129
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:06,791
He's… he's really kind,
and he's-he's really sweet,

2130
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:09,333
and he's funny, and he has my back,
and he cares about me,

2131
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:12,000
and he would never make me have
a threesome with this horrible woman.

2132
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:16,125
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, no, I'm not… being great.

2133
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:17,583
Logan, you're right.

2134
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:19,625
I don't want to do this.

2135
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:22,333
And, uh, I don't want to do anything
with you ever again.

2136
01:23:22,416 --> 01:23:25,125
Um, see you at school.

2137
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,041
(sighs)

2138
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:32,458
(sighs)

2139
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,666
Okay, well, and then…

2140
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,791
There were two.

2141
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,625
- (sighs) Wow.
- (chuckles)

2142
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:44,250
(both sighing)

2143
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,500
Three times?

2144
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:48,208
- Oh, thanks, babe.
- Here.

2145
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:49,708
Yeah.

2146
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,791
- (sighs)
- Oh, I'm dying.

2147
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,791
I can't even move.

2148
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,083
- I need a shower.
- Me, too.

2149
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,625
(sighs) And then pie.

2150
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:00,958
Wait for me.

2151
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:02,750
- Okay.
- (sighs)

2152
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:04,833
- (shower running)
- (Ginny and Noah moaning)

2153
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:10,916
♪ ♪

2154
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,208
(Ginny laughs)

2155
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,291
(moaning continues)

2156
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:30,000
Hi.

2157
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:31,166
Hey.

2158
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,625
(both chuckle)

2159
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:34,125
Um, 'kay.

2160
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:35,375
(sighs) Yeah.

2161
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:37,375
- I had a really weird night.
- Yeah. (laughs)

2162
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:40,666
- Something in the air.
- Uh, maybe the weirdest night ever.

2163
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:41,833
Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec.

2164
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,291
- Uh, actually, you, um…
- I am so hungry.

2165
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,958
Listen. Wait, Emma. Sorry.

2166
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:48,458
Um, before we get into anything, uh…

2167
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:51,916
I got something I got to tell you,
and it's-it's really kind of bad,

2168
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,500
so let me just kind of say it quickly
before I lose my nerve.

2169
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:56,166
Okay.

2170
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:00,000
Noah asked Ginny to marry him.

2171
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,208
And, um, she said yes.

2172
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,791
I'm sorry.

2173
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:10,625
I mean, I-I know you think
that Noah's the love of your life,

2174
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:13,625
and I understand that, but maybe
he's not the love of your life, right?

2175
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:16,666
Maybe if he's marrying Ginny,
that's meant to be,

2176
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,291
and there's something for you
out there that's-that's better,

2177
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:21,708
- that's meant to be, and you j…
- Yes.

2178
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:23,250
No, you're right.

2179
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,458
I am?

2180
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,833
- Yeah.
- Okay.
