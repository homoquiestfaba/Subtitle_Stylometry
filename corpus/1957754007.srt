1
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,041
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:13,180
<i>I'll dry the tears</i>
<i>from your eyes</i>

3
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:19,219
<i>Let's don't let</i>
<i>a good thing die</i>

4
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,639
<i>Snowman's coming</i>

5
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,375
<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

6
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,213
<i>He'll take you by the hand</i>

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,017
<i>He'll say one, two, three</i>

8
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,654
<i>And you will be...</i>

9
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:58,560
<i>In cotton candy land</i>

10
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,828
<i>For those of you</i>
<i>who are wondering,</i>

11
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,831
<i>who this fella here is,</i>

12
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:09,704
<i>I am the legendary</i>
<i>Colonel Tom Parker.</i>

13
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,151
<i>Colonel Tom Parker,</i>
<i>legendary manager</i>

14
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:28,121
<i>of Elvis Presley, has been</i>
<i>rushed to Valley Hospital.</i>

15
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,994
<i>I am the man who</i>
<i>gave the world Elvis Presley.</i>

16
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:40,969
<i>Without me, there would be</i>
<i>no Elvis Presley.</i>

17
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,704
<i>And yet, there are some</i>

18
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,273
<i>who'd make me out</i>
<i>to be the villain</i>

19
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,275
<i>of this here story.</i>

20
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:07,662
<i>Colonel Tom Parker</i>
<i>was a liar, a cheat, a con man.</i>

21
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,231
<i>A shocking new book</i>
<i>accuses Colonel Tom Parker</i>

22
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,901
<i>of massive fraud</i>
<i>and mis-management.</i>

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,374
Parker received as much
as 50% of Elvis' income.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,275
<i>He worked Elvis like a mule,</i>

25
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,978
<i>to support his own</i>
<i>gambling addiction.</i>

26
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:25,813
<i>The court finds</i>
<i>that the compensation received</i>

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,849
<i>by Colonel Parker</i>
<i>was excessive,</i>

28
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,717
<i>and shocked the conscience</i>
<i>of the court.</i>

29
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,586
<i>Many believe</i>
<i>that Colonel Tom Parker</i>

30
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:34,689
<i>was responsible for the death</i>
<i>of Elvis Presley.</i>

31
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,759
Now, you listen to me.

32
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,095
The only thing that matters
is that that man

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,497
gets up on that stage tonight.

34
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,521
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

35
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:48,596
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

36
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:59,640
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

37
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,050
<i>Tom Parker killed him!</i>

38
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:12,220
No! That's not true.

39
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:29,504
No, no, I didn't kill him.

40
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,441
I made Elvis Presley.

41
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:40,380
<i>Nothing all those muckrakers</i>
<i>said in their books was true.</i>

42
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,850
Me and Elvis, we was partners.

43
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:48,890
It was Elvis the Showman
and the Colonel the Snowman.

44
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,825
<i>This is the lying Dutchman.</i>

45
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:54,028
<i>I always knew I was</i>
<i>destined for greatness.</i>

46
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,931
<i>As an orphan,</i>
<i>I ran away to the carnival,</i>

47
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:59,967
<i>where I learned the art</i>
<i>of the "snow job,"</i>

48
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,137
<i>of emptying a rube's wallet</i>
<i>while leaving them with nothing</i>

49
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,840
<i>but a smile on their face.</i>

50
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,708
<i>But a carnival act</i>
<i>that would get you</i>

51
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,477
<i>the most money, the most snow,</i>

52
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:14,115
<i>had great costumes</i>
<i>and a unique trick,</i>

53
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,883
<i>that gave the audience feelings</i>

54
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,386
<i>they weren't sure</i>
<i>they should enjoy.</i>

55
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,454
<i>But they do.</i>

56
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:26,627
<i>And I knew if I could</i>
<i>find such an act,</i>

57
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:30,798
<i>I could create the greatest...</i>

58
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,166
<i>show...</i>

59
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,433
<i>on...</i>

60
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,704
<i>earth.</i>

61
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,274
<i>After the carnival, I moved</i>
<i>into the music business...</i>

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,877
<i>the country music business.</i>

63
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:47,447
<i>I partnered with one of its</i>
<i>biggest stars, Hank Snow.</i>

64
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:53,187
<i>Pardon me</i>
<i>if I'm sentimental</i>

65
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:55,323
<i>When we say goodbye</i>

66
00:05:55,388 --> 00:06:00,027
<i>And his hapless son,</i>
<i>Jimmie Rodgers Snow.</i>

67
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,095
Hot-diggity-dog, Billy.

68
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:03,064
-I got one.
-Oh, yeah.

69
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,067
Can't believe it.
Blow their socks off.

70
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,169
Security. Security, Diskin!

71
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:11,272
Tell the mayors of these towns
that we need a police escort

72
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,840
for Hank when he arrives.

73
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:16,143
In Baton Rouge, we are going
to have a carny wedding

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,645
at the top of the Ferris Wheel,

75
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,847
so, Zina, pick out
your next husband.

76
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,482
In New Orleans, we're gonna
use the loudspeaker

77
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,552
- to announce you, Hank.
- Oh, sure.

78
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,388
...you are going to march
in the parade.

79
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,759
Am I gonna be riding
on an elephant, too?

80
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:34,095
A man on an elephant
looks important.

81
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,363
And taller.

82
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,731
We still need to get
a novelty act

83
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,599
-to bring in the young folk.
-Well, yes, yes,

84
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,636
that's why you have
a meeting with
the Duke of Paducah tonight.

85
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,905
If we can book "the Funniest
Mouth in the South,"

86
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,405
we'll have the greatest show
of the season.

87
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,574
Hey, Jimmie,
turn that record off.

88
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,109
Y'all have to hear this.

89
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,011
Kids all over town
are playing it everywhere I go.

90
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,419
I hear Negro rhythms.

91
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,055
But with a country flavor.

92
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:03,624
Sun Records?
That's Sam Phillips' label.

93
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,226
Oh, yeah, Phillips.

94
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,129
He makes all those race records
with the colored singers.

95
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,231
Well, this fella's
on the Hayride tonight,

96
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,899
after me in the newcomer spot.

97
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,234
In Shreveport?

98
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:16,137
No, they are not putting
a colored boy on the Hayride.

99
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,472
That's the thing. He's white.

100
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,509
He's...

101
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:24,812
He's white?

102
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,213
<i>What do you think,</i>
<i>Texarkana?</i>

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,115
<i>Shall we play it</i>
<i>for the 27th time?</i>

104
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,884
<i>Well, that's all right,</i>
<i>mama</i>

105
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,686
<i>That's all right for you</i>

106
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,287
<i>Shall we play it</i>
<i>for the 27th time?</i>

107
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,190
<i>Everybody's talkin' 'bout</i>
<i>this new Presley kid</i>

108
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,458
<i>That's all right...</i>

109
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:43,197
<i>That's all right</i>
<i>That's all right...</i>

110
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,969
He's white?

111
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,610
<i>But it don't matter</i>
<i>if you do ten stupid things,</i>

112
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,814
<i>as long as you do</i>
<i>one smart one.</i>

113
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,088
<i>Welcome y'all</i>
<i>to the Louisiana Hayride,</i>

114
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,459
<i>broadcasting live</i>
<i>to 26 of these United States.</i>

115
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,161
<i>How do you think I feel</i>

116
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,799
<i>I know your love's not real</i>

117
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,069
Well, the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

118
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:23,437
Where is the Colonel?

119
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,774
You have the fella that's
singing the "All Right, Mama,"

120
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,243
that new record that's
on the Sun label, eh?

121
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,479
-The pop jocks
keep playing him.
-Yeah.

122
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,980
Country DJs, too.

123
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,416
Even the colored kids,
they're buyin' his record.

124
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:39,453
The colored ki-- Well, where
would I find such an act?

125
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,022
The dressing room.

126
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:47,294
- Oh. Howdy.
- Hey, Elvis Presley?

127
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,396
-Blue Moon Boys?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,064
-You're up next.
-Oh, sh--

129
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,701
Excuse me. Bill, go time!

130
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,903
I know, I know.

131
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,571
- Hi!
- How's his stomach?

132
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,973
I thought I'd grab him a Pepsi,

133
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,975
but poor thing's still shaking
like a leaf.

134
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,944
I'll get him on the stage.
Come on. Let's go.

135
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,615
Here.

136
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,983
It'll settle your stomach.

137
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,851
What if I forget
the words on live radio?

138
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,187
All we gotta do out there's
just a bit of clownin' around.

139
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,956
That's how we got this thing
started in the first place.

140
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,758
Scotty and Bill are right,
Elvis.

141
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,226
You're not out there
on your own.

142
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,062
- You boys are a band.
- That's right.

143
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,797
The Lord gave us music
to bring people together.

144
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,265
We're like a family,

145
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,400
and family is the most
important thing of all.

146
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,968
Amen.

147
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,739
Come on now, Booby.
Jesse's shining bright tonight.

148
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,543
Shining down his strength
upon you.

149
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:44,618
<i>Oh, I'll fly away</i>

150
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:49,690
<i>Jesse, Elvis's twin</i>
<i>brother, who died at birth.</i>

151
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,325
<i>Tragic.</i>

152
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,494
<i>Vernon, come quick!</i>
<i>It's another child!</i>

153
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:57,098
<i>My darling,</i>
<i>you'll have</i>
<i>the strength of two men.</i>

154
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,900
<i>But when</i>
<i>my boy's daddy</i>
<i>passed a bad check</i>

155
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,368
<i>and got carted off</i>
<i>to prison...</i>

156
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,839
<i>...the boy and his mama had</i>
<i>to take one of the houses</i>

157
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,141
<i>for white folks</i>
<i>in a colored neighborhood.</i>

158
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,809
<i>New boy! Come over!</i>

159
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,845
<i>But that boy</i>
<i>had a big imagination.</i>

160
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,148
<i>He really believed</i>
<i>he was the hero</i>

161
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,150
<i>in one of them comic books.</i>

162
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,953
<i>He was going to bust</i>
<i>his daddy out of the hoosegow</i>

163
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,890
<i>and fly him</i>
<i>to the Rock of Eternity!</i>

164
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,426
Then he buys
his mama a pink Cadillac.

165
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:28,062
Pink Cadillac?
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,763
Hey, fools! Whoo!

167
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,668
<i>Ohh</i>

168
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,805
<i>Black snake</i>
<i>crawlin' in my room</i>

169
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,608
Come on, Doc, let's go.

170
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,477
<i>Them comic book heroes</i>

<i>His was music.</i>

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

<i>Ohh...</i>
<i>Black snake crawlin'</i>

00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,774
Move, man. Hey, it's my turn.

00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,220
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

177
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,994
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

<i>Oh, I'll fly away</i>
<i>Oh, Glory</i>

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,384
<i>I'll fly away</i>

180

<i>When I die</i>

181
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,756
<i>When I die</i>
<i>Hallelujah, by and by</i>

182
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,091
What you doin'?

183
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,861
<i>I'll fly away</i>

184
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,163
<i>-No more preachin', no more</i>

185
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,099
<i>-No more pain, no more</i>
<i>-I'll fly away</i>

186
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,535
<i>I'll fly away</i>

187
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:14,868

<i>I'll fly away</i>

190
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,406
Hey, fool, come back.

191
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,843
No. He's with the spirit!

192
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:24,745
It's all right.

193
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:32,554
<i>Ohh</i>

194
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,590

<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

197
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,330
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

198
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,132
<i>Anyway you choose</i>

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,270
<i>I'll fly away, oh, Glory</i>

200
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,406
<i>I'll fly away</i>

201
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:54,275
<i>Oh, away</i>

<i>- Ohhh</i>
<i>- I'll fly away</i>

204
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,584
Elvis. Come on,
you gotta get on in.

205
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,984
They've already announced you
on the radio.

206
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,554
Folks are real excited.

207
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,290
<i>At Sun Records,</i>
<i>Sam Phillips was on a mission</i>

208
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,727
<i>to save the world</i>
<i>by recording Black music.</i>

209
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,895
<i>But it didn't sell.</i>

210
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,430
<i>So to pay his bills,</i>

211
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:20,167
<i>he needed to find a new singer</i>
<i>for his country act.</i>

212
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,103
I don't know what it is
you see in this boy.

213
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,906
I just think he's different.

214
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,013
How do you know
"Big Boy" Crudup?

215
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:39,019
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right for you</i>

216
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,456
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

217
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:46,360
<i>That's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

218
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:51,265
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

219
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,471
He's a young singer
from Memphis, Tennessee.

220
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,142
Got a song out
on the Sun label.
It's all over the radio.

221
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,914
Give him a warm Hayride welcome
to a Mr. Elvis Presley.

222
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,001
Elvis,
how are you this evening?

223
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,504
Just fine, how you, sir?

224
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:34,274
<i>Greasy hair,</i>
<i>girly makeup.</i>

225
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,512
<i>I cannot overstate</i>
<i>how strange he looked.</i>

226
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,614
Are you all geared up
with your band there to...

227
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,850
-I'm all geared up.
-...let us hear your songs?

228
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,819
Uh... well, I'd like to say how
happy we are to be down here.

229
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,621
It's a real honor
for us to be...

230
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,757
Get a chance to appear
on the Louisiana Hayride.

231
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,626
We're gonna do a song for you
we got out on Sun Records.

232
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:54,061
Uh...

233
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,563
You got anything else
to say, sir?

234
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,965
No. I'm ready.

235
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,305
It goes...

236
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,374
It goes something like this.

237
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,479
<i>Oh, baby, baby,</i>

238
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,816
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

239
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:16,851
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

240
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,354
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

241
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,657
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

242
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,394
<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

243
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,831
Get a haircut, fairy!

244
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,739
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>in a flash of lightning,</i>

245
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,775
<i>I watched that skinny boy</i>
<i>in the pink suit</i>

246
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:44,612
<i>transform into a superhero.</i>

247
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,983
<i>Well, you may go to college</i>
<i>You may go to school</i>

248
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,655
<i>You may have a pink Cadillac</i>
<i>But don't you be</i>
<i>nobody's fool</i>

249
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,724
<i>Now, baby</i>
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

250
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,425
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

251
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:02,597
<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

252
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,833
<i>Well, listen and</i>
<i>I'll tell you, baby</i>

253
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,467
<i>What I'm talking about</i>

254
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,038
<i>Come on back to me,</i>
<i>little girl</i>
<i>So we can play some house</i>

255
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,808
<i>Baby, come back, baby, come</i>

256
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,075
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

257
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,278
<i>Come back, baby</i>
<i>I wanna play house with you</i>

258
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,515
<i>Wanna play house!</i>

259
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:23,050
-What are they hollerin' at?
-The wiggle!

260
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,284
The what?

261
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,653
Them girls
wanna see you wiggle.

262
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,788
Move, man!

263
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,823
-Do more!
-Much more!

264
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,958
Man!

265
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,526
Do it again.

266
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,498
<i>Well, this is one thing, baby</i>
<i>That I want you to know</i>

267
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,399
<i>Come on back</i>
<i>Let's play a little house</i>

268
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,935
<i>And we can do</i>
<i>what we did before</i>

269
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:41,936
<i>Now, baby</i>

270
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:42,937
Sit down!

271
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,338
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>

272
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,941
<i>Come back, baby, come</i>
<i>Come back, baby</i>

273
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,710
What in God's sweet name
am I looking at?

274
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:49,777
Hit it!

275
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,543
What were you thinking,
Jimmie?

276
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,245
I don't know what I'm thinking.

277
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,250
Please, Lord,
don't let 'em hurt my baby.

278
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,587
Hurt him?
Looks like they wanna--

279
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:39,827
<i>Baby, baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>baby</i>

280
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:43,731
<i>Now, I don't</i>
<i>know nothin' about music...</i>

281
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,870
<i>...but I could see</i>
<i>in that girl's eyes,</i>

282
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,572
<i>that she was having feelings</i>

283
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:53,541
<i>she wasn't sure</i>
<i>she should enjoy.</i>

284
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:56,811
<i>Black snake crawlin' in my room</i>

285
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:58,513
<i>Yes.</i>

286
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:05,285
<i>He was a taste</i>
<i>of forbidden fruit.</i>

287
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,223
<i>She could've eaten him alive.</i>

288
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,742
Why are you trying
to kill my son?

289
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,011
<i>It was the greatest</i>
<i>carnival attraction</i>

290
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,980
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

291
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,481
<i>He was my destiny.</i>

292
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:39,486
<i>Right under my nose...</i>
<i>In Memphis.</i>

293
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:43,390
<i>Top of the morning</i>
<i>to you, friends,</i>

294
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,627
<i>from the home of colorful,</i>
<i>old Beale Street.</i>

295
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:48,863
<i>The place where the blues began</i>
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

296
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,398
<i>Where you see pretty browns</i>
<i>dressed in beautiful gowns,</i>

297
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,968
<i>along with tailor-mades</i>
<i>and hand-me-downs.</i>

298
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,638
<i>Where you see honest men</i>
<i>and pickpockets skilled,</i>

299
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:59,439
<i>and business never closes</i>
<i>till somebody gets killed.</i>

300
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,141
<i>Now, just kidding.</i>

301
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,711
<i>But there's a lot goin' down</i>
<i>on Beale Street tonight,</i>

302
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,913
<i>and nowhere more-so</i>
<i>than at the Club Handy.</i>

303
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,016
<i>Come around if you wanna see</i>
<i>Big Mama Thornton,</i>

304
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,484
<i>layin' down her newest hit.</i>

305
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:11,853
<i>Get it, get it</i>

306
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,854
Get it! Come on!

307
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,622
<i>Oh, let's do it</i>

308
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:18,191
<i>Now, listen up,</i>
<i>while Brown America speaks.</i>

309
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,597
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

310
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,464
<i>Quit snoopin'</i>
<i>'round my door</i>

311
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:37,545
<i>Just why</i>
<i>a truck driver</i>
<i>from Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

312
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:41,149
<i>liked to hang out</i>
<i>on Beale Street, I do not know.</i>

313
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:45,218
<i>You told me</i>
<i>you was high class</i>
<i>But I could see through that...</i>

314
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,522
<i>But it did him no favors,</i>

315
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:51,458
<i>fitting into them</i>
<i>white housing projects.</i>

316
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:54,162
Hey, squirrel. Nice shoes.

317
00:19:54,227 --> 00:20:01,268
<i>And, Daddy, I know</i>
<i>That you ain't</i>
<i>no real cool cat</i>

318
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,403
Hey, Elvis!

319
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,146
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

320
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,481
<i>That's that boy whose record</i>
<i>everybody's talkin' about.</i>

321
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:23,591
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

322
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,147
<i>Hey, sideburns.</i>
<i>Where's the Negro suit today?</i>

323
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:51,018
<i>He was crazy</i>
<i>for that Beale Street music.</i>

324
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,688
<i>Beale Street style.</i>

325
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:57,158
<i>He had Beale Street stars</i>
<i>in his eyes.</i>

326
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:59,160
What do you think, Tony? Huh?

327
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,795
B.B. King.

328
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:05,499
<i>No, I didn't take my boy away</i>
<i>from nothin'.</i>

329
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,970
<i>He was runnin'</i>
<i>from the day he was born.</i>

330
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:13,440
<i>I just opened the door</i>
<i>to our destiny.</i>

331
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:16,644
<i>So without so much as</i>
<i>a word to your daddy and me,</i>

332
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,179
<i>you quit your job</i>
<i>to go traveling</i>

333
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:20,882
<i>all the way to Florida</i>
<i>with this Colonel fellow</i>

334
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,583
<i>that we have never met.</i>

335
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,185
Mama, it's only four days.

336
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,687
Yeah, four days.
And then what?

337
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:30,290
I knew a fella once,
got his record on the radio.

338
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,560
It was all over in a flash.

339
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:35,663
Mama, I'm just trying
to take care of you and Daddy.

340
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,665
That's all I have
ever cared about.

341
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:39,432
I ain't ever gonna let us
get back to a place again

342
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,735
where Daddy gets in trouble
with the law

343
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,637
-to put food on the table.
-Elvis!

344
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:44,939
How dare you?

345
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:46,941
As the good Lord warns us,

346
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:49,544
do not wear yourself out
to get rich.

347
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,714
Do not trust your own
goddamn cleverness!

348
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,486
Elvis, you've upset your mama.

349
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,502
You know, Mama,
I was thinkin',

350
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,571
maybe I'll buy you one of them
pink Cadillacs

351
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:18,906
like you saw back when
you was working
at the hospital.

352
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:21,943
I don't need no pink Cadillac.

353
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,713
Satnin, I just gotta be making

354
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,347
the most of this thing
while I can.

355
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,450
It's like Daddy says, this
could all be over in a flash.

356
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:33,321
I'm not fearful
of it being over, Booby.

357
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,324
I don't know how to explain it.

358
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:40,061
But I saw it
in that girl's eyes.

359
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:44,464
It's something beyond us,
but I know that whatever it is,

360
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:47,034
it's something that...

361
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:49,804
It's something
that can come between us.

362
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:53,341
Oh, no, Mama, no. Hey.

363
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,408
Ain't nothing ever
gonna do that.

364
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,546
You're my girl. My Satnin.

365
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:01,082
You'll always be
my bestest girl.

366
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,984
Hey.

367
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,786
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

368
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:09,123
I will call you every night.

369
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,095
Will you promise me, Booby?

370
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,864
I promise.

371
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,499
I promise. I promise,
I promise.

372
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,602
-All right. I love you.
-Bye, baby.

373
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:23,337
<i>Nothing but nothing...</i>

374
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,437
I love you.

375
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:25,907
<i>...is gonna come between us.</i>

376
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,209
- Let's go!
- Bye, Booby!

377
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,810
See you soon!

378
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:33,281
Wanna bet?

379
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:36,717
<i>Well, it's one for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

380
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,819
<i>Three to get ready</i>
<i>Now go, cat, go</i>

381
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:43,724
<i>But don't you</i>
<i>Step on my blue suede shoes</i>

382
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,126
<i>Well, you can do anything</i>

383
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:48,696
<i>But stay off of my</i>
<i>Blue suede shoes</i>

384
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:51,565
<i>Well, you can knock me down</i>
<i>Step in my face</i>

385
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:53,401
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

386
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,902
<i>I have some good news.</i>

387
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:58,105
<i>Our next four nights</i>
<i>are sold out...</i>

388
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,907
<i>...thanks to the dazzling</i>
<i>performances</i>

389
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:04,011
<i>of our tremendous showman,</i>
<i>Hank Snow.</i>

390
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:11,118
<i>Pardon me if I'm sentimental</i>
<i>When we say goodbye</i>

391
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,887
<i>And I've noticed</i>
<i>a mild interest</i>

392
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,523
<i>in our newest act,</i>
<i>Elvis Presley.</i>

393
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,496
Hi.

394
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,266
Yeah, Dixie, I'll be back
before prom.

395
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:32,640
<i>Well you can burn my house</i>
<i>Steal my car</i>

396
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:35,142
<i>Drink my liquor</i>
<i>From an old fruit jar</i>

397
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,178
<i>Do anything</i>
<i>that you want to do</i>

398
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,714
Colonel,
what is that boy
doing on our tour?

399
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,215
Well, I told you
all about him.

400
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:43,517
And he wants to record
one of your songs.

401
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,119
Oh? Which one?

402
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,220
All of them.

403
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,089
Well, you warn him plenty.

404
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:52,526
None of those lewd gyrations
or sudden, jerky movements.

405
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,497
Let's go!

406
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,767
Let's rock!

407
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:09,677
Is that a pair
of young ladies' intimates

408
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:11,178
I see upon the stage?

409
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,147
Yes, I believe it is, Hank.

410
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:16,317
Best not happen
when he sings one of my songs.

411
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:17,852
I'm sure it won't.

412
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,186
<i>Elvis, the papers say</i>
<i>there are girls</i>

413
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,855
<i>around your hotel</i>
<i>all night long.</i>

414
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,623
<i>I don't even go out, Mama.</i>
<i>I stay in.</i>

415
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,492
<i>You know, it gets lonesome.</i>

416
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,094
<i>I tell you, this</i>
<i>new sensation, Elvis Presley,</i>

417
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,063
<i>he's breaking hearts</i>
<i>all over the South.</i>

418
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,898
Quit knocking at my door,
Scotty.

419
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:42,543
<i>Are you sorry</i>
<i>We drifted apart?</i>

420
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:47,314
<i>Never know</i>
<i>How much I love you</i>

421
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:52,253
<i>Never know how much I care</i>

422
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,656
<i>When you put your arms</i>
<i>around me</i>

423
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,095
<i>Oh, come on, E.P.</i>

424
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:03,764
Life on the road ain't
the concern of folks back home.

425
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,032
<i>Fever</i>

426
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,901
Why don't you try
one of these?

427
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:09,136
Put the pep back
into your step.

428
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:12,039
<i>What a lovely way to burn</i>

429
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:15,910
<i>Well, shake,</i>
<i>rattle and roll</i>

430
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:18,179
<i>I said shake,</i>
<i>rattle and roll</i>

431
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:21,315
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>
<i>I said shake, rattle and roll</i>

432
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,517
<i>Well, you won't do right</i>

433
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,584
Whoo!

434
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,985
<i>To save your doggone soul</i>

435
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:26,220
You're really
something else, man!

436
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:27,788
I promise,
I'll put my heart in--

437
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,290
I wanna be just like you!

438
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,858
Okay. Yeah, thank you.

439
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:32,660
I can no longer,
in good conscience,

440
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,961
go on stage with that boy.

441
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:37,031
Yes, a conundrum. A conundrum.

442
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:40,434
Please welcome
to the stage, Hank Snow!

443
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:44,305
After I perform, I shall
spend the night in prayer.

444
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:47,308
And I will do
what needs to be done.

445
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,852
Come on, Jimmie!

446
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:03,624
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>that I feel</i>

447
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:06,127
<i>Oh, baby</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>

448
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:09,663
<i>How do you think</i>
<i>that I feel</i>

449
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:23,344
<i>That night,</i>
<i>I happened to see him.</i>

450
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,646
<i>Alone.</i>

451
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,648
<i>Lost.</i>

452
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:34,855
<i>A snowman is only as good...</i>

453
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:37,258
<i>as his attraction.</i>

454
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,893
Elvis!

455
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,928
-Come on, man.
-Elvis, come on! Hurry up!

456
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,935
<i>It was all,</i>
<i>or nothing.</i>

457
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:49,571
Elvis, we're going
to the hall of mirrors!

458
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:51,105
Wait up!

459
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,073
Screw the hall
of mirrors. That's boring.

460
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,347
Right, hang on.
Here we go.

461
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,251
Hold on.

462
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,821
All right, fellas. Come on.

463
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,460
- Oh.
- Lost, my boy?

464
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,097
Colonel Parker, sir.

465
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:22,504
You look lost.

466
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,838
-I guess I am.
-Ah, yes.

467
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:28,475
The roar of the crowd.
The life on the road.

468
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:30,878
And then calling home
to your loved ones,

469
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:33,013
pretending nothing has changed,

470
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,816
when everything has.

471
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:39,019
Yeah. Lost.

472
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:43,123
I'm sorry, sir. I... I meant
I don't know the way out.

473
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,861
Yeah, that is precisely
what I am saying.

474
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:53,033
I... I saw you.
Apart from all the others.

475
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,135
Burdened.

476
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,138
Like you don't know
how to get out of this.

477
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,508
But I do.

478
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,777
<i>Snowman's coming</i>

479
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:05,279
Allow me to show you.

480
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:08,082
<i>Yes, he's coming</i>

481
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:12,753
<i>Take his magic hand</i>

482
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,556
Creatures of the carnival.

483
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:16,957
And I am one myself.

484
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:20,194
It's where I learned the art
of the snow job.

485
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,795
- Snow job?
- Yes.

486
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,598
It's like the trick
you do with the wiggling,

487
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:25,165
getting all the girls
hyped up,

488
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:26,934
empty their wallets
and leave them

489
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,571
with nothing but the smiles
on their faces.

490
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:30,739
I'm no trickster.

491
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,674
Oh, yes, you are.

492
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:34,942
All showmen are snowmen.

493
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,844
It's a wonderful place.

494
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,445
Nobody on the aerio.

495
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:46,120
Your future, Mr. Presley,
blazing before you.

496
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:49,790
Recording contracts,
television, even Hollywood.

497
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,562
You're great, Colonel.

498
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,965
You are the best person
I could ever hope to work with.

499
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,668
You know, this is something
I ain't never

500
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,435
said to nobody before...

501
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,605
But I believe
I can be great, too.

502
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,205
Oh, no doubt.

503
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:08,275
But we could be
even greater together.

504
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:13,447
But to achieve this, I need
to represent you exclusively.

505
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:16,150
Exclusively?
Sir, I... I don't follow.

506
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,819
What about Hank Snow?

507
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,755
Hank. Yes...

508
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,990
He sent me here to fire you.

509
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,162
Hank wants you off the tour.

510
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:31,999
So I will have to leave Hank.

511
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,835
We will both have to
make sacrifices.

512
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:38,506
We will need a record label
with national distribution.

513
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,009
RCA?

514
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,580
RCA.

515
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,148
Sam Phillips... discovered me.

516
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:51,485
I know, but we have a way
to help Sam understand

517
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:54,823
that it would be foolish of him
to hold you back.

518
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,990
Every man has his price.

519
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:59,026
RCA does have
the distribution.

520
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:00,127
I just need to know
that you'll

521
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,428
still be with me as friends.

522
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:03,565
Don't doubt that,
we're not going anywhere.

523
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:07,301
Marion and I just don't want to
stand in your way, that's all.

524
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:10,638
The world needs
to hear you sing, Elvis.

525
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:13,173
<i>Elvis Presley's</i>
<i>contract sold to RCA today</i>

526
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,242
<i>for the highest price</i>
<i>in music history.</i>

527
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,911
<i>Quite the payday</i>
<i>for Sun Records.</i>

528
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:20,981
It's just business.
Show business.

529
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:22,316
To achieve truly great things,

530
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,652
one must make
truly great sacrifices.

531
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,455
You will have to be free
of any entanglements.

532
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:32,259
You see, my boy,
show business is snow business.

533
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:36,263
<i>And the fans need to believe</i>
<i>that you are always available.</i>

534
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,031
The Colonel says
that with all the publicity

535
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:39,433
that's gonna be coming,

536
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,770
he might have to
put it out there that...

537
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,137
That...

538
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,472
I don't have a girl.

539
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:52,212
Then we will need
your parents' legal commitment.

540
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,717
They may need a bit
of convincing themselves.

541
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:57,719
Sam Phillips
is a good man we can trust.

542
00:31:57,786 --> 00:32:01,221
We don't know this Colonel
from a nail in a wall.

543
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:03,157
Is there a lawyer
representing the family?

544
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:04,559
Oh, unnecessary.

545
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:06,160
I am of the firm opinion

546
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:09,496
that family is the most
important thing in the world.

547
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:12,299
In mind of that,
I have taken the liberty

548
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,168
of making these contracts out

549
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:17,539
in the name
of Elvis Presley Enterprises.

550
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:18,640
A family business.

551
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,676
And I was thinking,
Vernon Presley:

552
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,310
Business Manager.

553
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:28,583
What do you think,
Daddy?

554
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,685
Uh... Well, uh...

555
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:32,787
- I like it very much, son.
- Ah!

556
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:38,025
Mrs. Presley,
your son has a unique gift.

557
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:39,694
It's as though
he has the strength

558
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:42,062
of two men inside of him.

559
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,365
<i>You know, Colonel,</i>
<i>I would do anything</i>

560
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,134
<i>to make sure my mama and daddy</i>
<i>never have to live</i>

561
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,102
<i>in no poverty ever again.</i>

562
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:52,774
Mama, it's gonna turn out
so, so good.

563
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:54,208
Mm.

564
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:58,613
Colonel, I wasn't fooling
when I told those other kids

565
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,280
I was gonna buy 'em
a Cadillac one day.

566
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:02,917
My boy, with me, you will
buy them two Cadillacs.

567
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,418
Two?

568
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,788
A hundred?

569
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:08,021
Two hundred.

570
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,958
-A thousand.
-A million.

571
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,258
An aeroplane.

572
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,093
How about a rocket ship?

573
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,632
Well, maybe not a rocket ship.
My mama don't like me to fly.

574
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:21,803
But me, I've always
wanted to fly. Fast.

575
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,807
Faster than the speed of light
to the Rock of Eternity.

576
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,008
What? To the Rock of Eternity?

577
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:29,677
Captain Marvel, Jr.

578
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:32,547
He's my favorite
comic book hero.

579
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,282
He flies.

580
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,417
Well, what about you,
Mr. Presley?

581
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:40,387
Are you ready to fly?

582
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,625
Yes, sir. I'm ready.

583
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:45,793
Ready to fly.

584
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,469
<i>Uh, Mr. Presley,</i>

585
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:57,539
<i>try not to move around</i>
<i>so much during the takes.</i>

586
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,040
If I can't move,
I can't sing.

587
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:02,977
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

588
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,782
<i>Well, I found a new place</i>
<i>To dwell</i>

589
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,584
<i>What is he doing?</i>
<i>We paid for this?</i>

590
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,485
<i>It's down at the end of</i>
<i>Lonely Street at...</i>

591
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,353
<i>It's a suicide song.</i>

592
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,957
<i>...Heartbreak Hotel</i>

593
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:19,027
<i>Them know-it-alls</i>
<i>said I'd backed</i>
<i>the wrong horse.</i>

594
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,295
<i>But my boy knew teenagers.</i>

595
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:25,567
<i>And that first record</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

596
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:30,370
<i>Well, it's so very hard to have</i>
<i>To leave the one you love</i>

597
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:33,808
<i>And you get more lonely</i>
<i>With each passing day</i>

598
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,014
<i>It's so lonely just sitting</i>
<i>And dreaming of...</i>

599
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,448
<i>In a few short months,</i>

600
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,317
<i>Elvis Presley has popped</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

601
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:45,520
<i>Everywhere he goes,</i>
<i>he causes riots,</i>

602
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:48,155
<i>mountains of press</i>
<i>and rivers of money.</i>

603
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:50,725
<i>It's another</i>
<i>gold record for Elvis Presley.</i>

604
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,761
<i>This one giving him his first</i>
<i>worldwide hit.</i>

605
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,002
Mrs. Presley, look!

606
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:04,471
Come on, Mrs. Presley,
let me show you
how to use this.

607
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,908
Come on, hens! Come on, hens!
Come on!

608
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:10,477
Come on! Outside!
Out of my house!

609
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:13,347
Come on, this way!
Come on, babies!

610
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,516
Dodger!

611
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,689
- Go, Billy boy!
- Ya-hoo-hoo!

612
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:23,591
<i>I took</i>
<i>my boy's wiggling</i>

613
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:26,360
<i>and put it in the movies.</i>

614
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:28,362
<i>I took his name and face,</i>

615
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,230
<i>and put it on all sorts of toys</i>

616
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,567
<i>and knick-knacks,</i>
<i>and called it...</i>

617
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:33,701
"Merchandise."

618
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:36,303
Your face on every
conceivable object,

619
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,941
including teddy bear, perfume,
plaster busts...

620
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:41,208
Of questionable likeness.

621
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:42,744
"The Elvis Presley Game."

622
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,947
Something so everyone
can show their love.

623
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:50,718
Grandma Dodger,
what is that behind your ear?

624
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,855
"I hate Elvis."

625
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:57,157
Huh?

626
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:58,693
Yes. I hate Elvis.

627
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,427
In my way of thinking,
"I love Elvis,"

628
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,696
that's an easy sell.

629
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,564
Those who hate your son
will do so

630
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,333
whether we profit
from it or not.

631
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,338
After all, what is hate worth
if it's free?

632
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:14,307
Oh, yeah. I get it.

633
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,346
Snowman strikes again.

634
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:24,418
Merchandise, promotion.
 Diskin, what else do we have?

635
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:25,920
- Necklaces.
- Necklaces.

636
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:29,189
- Scarves.
- Oh, scarves. Yes...

637
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,926
<i>Mr. Presley</i>
<i>and Mr. King...</i>

638
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,193
regular peas in a pod,

639
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,096
relieving me
of my finest threads.

640
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:36,263
Must be some occasion.

641
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,565
Mr. Lansky, it's Milton Berle.

642
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,499
The whole of America'll
be watching.

643
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,769
I don't watch television.

644
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:42,837
So what's it gonna be?

645
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:44,739
How you gonna
blow their wigs off?

646
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:48,142
Well, the network
wants me to do a ballad.

647
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,545
But I'm thinking about
cuttin' it up with "Hound Dog."

648
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,746
Whoo!

649
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:57,752
Elvis Presley, "Hound Dog,"
and Uncle Miltie.

650
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:59,787
Strange things
are happening every day.

651
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:02,890
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog, hound dog</i>

652
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,892
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

653
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:07,494
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>but a hound dog</i>

654
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,931
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

655
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,766
<i>Well, you ain't never</i>
<i>Caught a rabbit</i>

656
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:14,502
<i>And you ain't</i>
<i>no friend of mine</i>

657
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,270
<i>When they said</i>
<i>You was high classed</i>

658
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:19,574
<i>Well, that was just a lie</i>

659
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,409
<i>Yeah, they said</i>
<i>You were high classed</i>

660
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:24,746
Behold, tomorrow,
all of America

661
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:27,181
will be talking
about Elvis Presley.

662
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,281
<i>My wiggling boy.</i>

663
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:33,020
Even as a little one,
he made me laugh so.

664
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,756
He's so funny!

665
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:37,257
<i>You never caught a rabbit</i>
<i>You ain't no friend of mine</i>

666
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:43,698
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog,</i>
<i>a hound dog</i>

667
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,466
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

668
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:48,035
And, Senator,
for the next leg

669
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,504
of your racial integrity tour,

670
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,607
we booked the Overton
Park Shell in Memphis.

671
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,509
What are they laughing about?

672
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,815
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

673
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,484
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

674
00:38:04,552 --> 00:38:06,654
Who the hell is that?

675
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:09,090
It's that boy from Memphis.

676
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,324
Elvis Presley.

677
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,528
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

678
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:17,932
A white boy from Memphis,
moving like a goddamn--

679
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:24,304
<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain</i>

680
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,975
<i>Shall I come back...</i>

681
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:32,947
<i>The obscenity and vulgarity</i>
<i>of this rock and roll music</i>

682
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:36,851
<i>is obviously a means by which</i>
<i>the white man and his children</i>

683
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,053
<i>can be driven to the level</i>
<i>of the Negro.</i>

684
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,088
<i>The colored folks have</i>
<i>been singing and playing it</i>

685
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,691
<i>just like</i>
<i>I'm doing it now, man,</i>
<i>more years than I know.</i>

686
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:45,293
Colonel Parker,
we called you in here

687
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:46,928
to talk about this act
of yours.

688
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,629
<i>A petition</i>
<i>has begun circulating</i>

689
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:51,299
<i>to bar Elvis Presley</i>
<i>from television.</i>

690
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:52,867
<i>We've set up a committee</i>

691
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,603
<i>to keep an eye on this vulgar,</i>
<i>animalistic rock and roll bum.</i>

692
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,470
<i>Your style</i>
<i>of gyrating while you sing</i>

693
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:58,806
<i>has been bitterly criticized...</i>

694
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:00,675
I don't feel I'm doing
anything wrong.

695
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,743
<i>We simply will not</i>
<i>advertise on any station</i>

696
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,344
<i>that puts this delinquent</i>
<i>on television.</i>

697
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,414
Colonel, you put an end
to your boy's animal behavior,

698
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,217
<i>or we will.</i>

699
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:11,953
<i>Don't worry, Senator,</i>
<i>my boy does what he's told.</i>

700
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,722
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

701
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:20,595
<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

702
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:26,334
"Elvis the Pelvis."

703
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:29,604
That's one of the most childish
expressions I've ever heard

704
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,706
coming from an adult.

705
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,941
Is Mr. Allen gonna cancel me
from the show?

706
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:35,943
Yes.

707
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,912
Yes, he is.

708
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:42,382
He is replacing you with one of
the country's greatest singers.

709
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:45,086
Mario Lanza?

710
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,386
Someone greater.

711
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:49,489
The new Elvis Presley!

712
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,227
Yeah, I snowed 'em!

713
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:56,163
You just have to put on
one of these tails here,

714
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,665
can sing the "Hound Dog,"

715
00:39:57,732 --> 00:40:00,868
and it's a light-hearted,
sophisticated family show.

716
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:02,370
I can't move in one of these.

717
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:03,436
And that is the point.

718
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,573
Mr. Allen agreed only as long

719
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,942
as there is no wiggling
of those hips.

720
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:10,678
I can't figure it out. My own
mother approves of what I do.

721
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,280
Mmm.

722
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:15,149
You have read the papers,
my boy?

723
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:16,784
Yeah, I read the papers.

724
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:19,153
The papers say that I shot
my mother and smoke marijuana.

725
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,223
Your movement's
in the style of a Black man,

726
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,792
and you have broken
the segregation laws.

727
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:26,894
So let's follow the plan.
It's a good plan.

728
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:29,030
You do the <i>Allen Show,</i>
family style,

729
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,498
and then tomorrow
we go back to Memphis and

730
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:35,336
we snow them on the July 4th
Children's Charitable Concert.

731
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:38,739
And we put this whole
unfortunate misstep behind us.

732
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:41,342
Now, do you want
to go into politics?

733
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:44,512
Or shall we stay
in show business?

734
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,282
<i>We want to do</i>
<i>a show the whole family</i>

735
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,318
<i>can watch and enjoy,</i>
<i>and we always do.</i>

736
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,019
<i>And at this time, it gives me</i>
<i>extreme pleasure to introduce</i>

737
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:53,888
<i>the new Elvis Presley!</i>

738
00:40:57,892 --> 00:40:59,427
<i>He used to be so hip.</i>

739
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:01,128
<i>He looked so silly.</i>

740
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:03,130
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he looked like a butler.</i>

741
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:04,632
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he agreed to sing to a dog.</i>

742
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,033
God damn it!

743
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:09,704
He could've given us
some warning.

744
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,405
I know how to do a skit,
I could've made it funny!

745
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:15,109
The most stupid, embarrassing,
humiliating thing I ever did.

746
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,011
Well, what the hell
do you want me to do about it?

747
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:18,145
We're musicians!

748
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:19,714
<i>It's just embarrassing.</i>

749
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,948
<i>Who does he think he is?</i>

750
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:42,203
<i>She just went on</i>
<i>and on about the damn dog.</i>

751
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,638
And I said, "Neighbors
shouldn't speak like that."

752
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:46,307
And then she said...

753
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:48,042
I like the bit with the dog.

754
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:50,478
It was the most embarrassing
performance of my life, Daddy.

755
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:52,646
She wasn't the only one
who said it.

756
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,482
-All the neighbors did.
-Oh, God.

757
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:55,983
Those New York people
were using you

758
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,752
to poke fun at the whole South.

759
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:01,555
Getting a laugh out of putting
a hillbilly in a tailcoat

760
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,958
and singing to a dog.

761
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,761
God damn it, Mama, it was
either that or I get canceled.

762
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:08,596
Then that's it for television.

763
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:11,599
Colonel says I'm running out
of states that I'm welcome in.

764
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:14,135
And they don't pay
unless I can perform.

765
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,071
So Colonel says I play the
charity concert tomorrow night,

766
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:19,273
as the new family style,

767
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,176
then everybody calms down
and we get back on track.

768
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:25,179
Someone's got to think about
keeping a roof over our heads.

769
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,847
Roof over our head?

770
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:29,483
We've always managed to keep
a roof over our head, Vernon.

771
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,552
Mama, Daddy is
business manager.
It's his job.

772
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,087
That's right.

773
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:35,524
We was doing just fine
before that man came along.

774
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:36,924
Colonel has got us all of this.

775
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:39,593
I don't want all this!
You're unhappy!

776
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,662
I am not!

777
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,598
You're losing yourself, Booby!

778
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:46,434
Oh, hell, Mama, I--

779
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,035
Satnin knows.

780
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:58,547
The way you sing
and move...

781
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:00,314
it's God-given.

782
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:03,851
So there can't be nothing
wrong with it.

783
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:08,523
Hey, I'm gonna ask cousin
about the movie.

784
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:09,924
Hey, E.P., E.P.!

785
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,492
Can we close down
the movie house

786
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,793
and watch <i>Godzilla</i> tonight?

787
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,162
Don't tramp mud
in the house, Billy!

788
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:16,664
But you said
we could watch the movie!

789
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,332
Get out! Get out of my
goddamn house!

790
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,000
- You said you'd take us!
 -Tramping mud in my house

791
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:21,536
and doing my damn head in.

792
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:24,872
Mama, you ain't never happy.

793
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:27,608
No matter what I do,
no matter how much I give you,

794
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,043
it ain't never enough.

795
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,712
And, I wish you would not drink
so goddamn much.

796
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,380
It's not good for you.

797
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,782
Baby!

798
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,383
-Put that back in the shed!
-Elvis, wait!

799
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,024
Elvis! Elvis, come on!
Elvis!

800
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,262
<i>Here's Elvis Presley.</i>

801
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:07,915
<i>This is</i>

<i>You can catch B.B. King tonight</i>

803

Hello.

805
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,658
E.P.!

806
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,694
- B.B.! Hey!
- Get over here!

807
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:58,699
Have a good night.

808
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:08,142
Thank you. Have a good night.

00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:33,000
Get him! Get him in here!
E.P.! E.P.!

812
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,404

00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:48,516
and the Colonel's
got me wearing tails,

00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:49,551
and everybody wants
something different.

818
00:45:49,618 --> 00:45:50,884
Hey, listen, man.

819
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,052
If you're sad

you're at the right place.

You're at the right place.

00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,594
So just do me a favor...

824
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:00,729
Let it all hang out.

825
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,930
Let it all hang out, E.P.!

00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:35,496
Sister Rosetta found this kid
in the backwaters of Georgia.

837
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,875
They should get the Colonel
to book him on Steve Allen.

838
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:54,048
They would love his moves.

00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:17,505
I would love to record that.

849
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:19,940
If you do, you'll make
a whole lot more money

850
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:21,676
than that kid
could ever dream of.

851
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:24,111
<i>Tutti frutti, oh rooty</i>

852
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:26,313
<i>Wop, bop-a-loo-bop,</i>
<i>Ba-lop, bom, bom</i>

853
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:43,330
<i>I'm a-workin'</i>
<i>on the building</i>

854
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:47,167
<i>Workin'</i>
<i>on the building</i>

855
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:50,270
<i>It's the new foundation</i>

856
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:53,775
<i>The new foundation</i>

857
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:56,110
<i>I'm goin' to heaven</i>

858
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:57,144
Yeah!

859
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,546
<i>Goin' to heaven</i>

860
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:01,915
<i>To get my reward</i>

861
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:05,787
<i>Get my reward</i>

862
00:48:05,854 --> 00:48:07,254
Whoo!

863
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:11,325
Ha-ha! That's all right.

864
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:14,161
That's a nice ride
you rode up in tonight.

865
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,930
It ain't like your ol'
big B.B. King bus.

866
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,635
Big Red.

867
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:24,204
Yeah, well, I can go where
I want, play what I want,

868
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:26,541
and if they don't like it,
I can go someplace else.

869
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,476
You've got to be
in control, man.

870
00:48:29,544 --> 00:48:31,513
You should have your own label,
like me.

871
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:34,214
You don't do the business,
the business will do you.

872
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:36,684
Man, I just leave all that
to the Colonel.

873
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,954
So it's, um...

874
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:43,290
It's his idea, this new Elvis?

875
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:45,660
Listen, I don't get it, man.

876
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:48,328
Cats buy your records
because they like what you do,

877
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:52,199
not because you're dressed up
like some... like some butler.

878
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,569
You really think those kids
want to see Elvis the butler

879
00:48:54,636 --> 00:48:56,069
at the Russwood Park
gig tomorrow?

880
00:48:56,136 --> 00:48:57,572
Man, I ain't wearing no tails.

881
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:01,509
I just...
gotta lay off the moves,
is all.

882
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:04,378
Colonel says if I don't,
they're gonna put me in jail.

883
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,050
Come on, man.

884
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:11,619
They're not gonna
put you in jail.

885
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:13,320
They might put me in jail
for walking across the street,

886
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,823
but you're a famous white boy.

887
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:17,491
Too many people are making
too much money off of you

888
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,026
to put you in jail.

889
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:19,960
You think so?

890
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,995
I know so.

891
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:27,367
Colonel's a smart man.
There's gotta be
another reason.

892
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:33,273
<i>Every day, yes</i>

893
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,311
<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

894
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:40,347
Hey, Elvis, B.B.!
Give us a smile.

895
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,886
<i>Every day</i>

896
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:47,488
<i>You promised us</i>
<i>a new Elvis, Colonel.</i>

897
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:51,526
Yet, here he is with this
B.B. King at Club Handy,

898
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:54,662
jiggling and wiggling
with Billy Ward, and here,

899
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:58,131
on Colored Night
at the Memphis Fairgrounds.

900
00:49:58,198 --> 00:49:59,901
We've been poking
into your background,

901
00:49:59,968 --> 00:50:01,636
and we've found your records.

902
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:03,872
"Unfit for military duty."

903
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:06,340
"Acute psychopathic state."

904
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:11,211
Well... I was pretending
to be crazy. I wanted out.

905
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:13,648
I was just a boy
from Huntington, West Virginia.

906
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:17,117
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

907
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,420
<i>Every day, yeah</i>

908
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:25,760
<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

909
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:30,297
<i>Every day</i>
<i>Are so strange</i>

910
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>Every day</i>
<i>People are stealing the planes</i>

911
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:36,538
<i>Oh! There are strange</i>
<i>Things happening</i>

912
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:41,108
<i>Every day</i>
<i>Oh, ain't that</i>
<i>strange, every day</i>

913
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:45,847
<i>Every day, yes</i>

914
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:50,752
<i>There are strange things</i>
<i>Happening every day</i>

915
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:55,422
<i>While 10,000 screaming</i>
<i>fans were cramming in</i>

916
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,859
<i>to see our show,</i>
<i>Senator Eastland was holding</i>

917
00:50:57,926 --> 00:51:01,361
<i>a segregationist rally</i>
<i>just three miles away.</i>

918
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:07,100
The mayor loved you
on the <i>Steve Allen Show.</i>

919
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,637
All the important people did.

920
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:12,172
What song are you going
to sing tonight?

921
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:14,642
I've made no decision.

922
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:18,680
I'll feel it.

923
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:26,721
Pay no mind
to all the cameras.

924
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:29,657
Those are our friends
in the vice squad.

925
00:51:29,724 --> 00:51:32,794
They don't mean nothing.
Ain't that right, chief?

926
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,630
As long as you don't
so much as wiggle a finger.

927
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,780
Oh, yes, sir,
good people!

928
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:56,283
A big thank you
to Shorty Morgan's Dixie Dolls!

929
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,418
But I know some of
the young people

930
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:01,188
are very excited
about this next act!

931
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,459
Jesse's with us tonight, baby.

932
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:08,930
Play it smart out there, yeah?

933
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:12,432
<i>Well, stop talking about it</i>
<i>We're talking</i>
<i>about everything</i>

934
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:14,702
<i>And do somethin' about it</i>

935
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,403
Elvis Presley!

936
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,173
<i>Strange things happening</i>
<i>Every day</i>

937
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,946
Just sing the nice song.
Smile the nice smile.

938
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:26,346
No wiggling.

939
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:28,382
Then we can get back
to our show business.

940
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,885
And have fun, my boy! Fun!

941
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:36,356
<i>Oh, we want peace!</i>

942
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:38,291
<i>We want peace!</i>

943
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:40,695
<i>We oughta stop</i>
<i>talkin' about it</i>
<i>And do somethin' about it</i>

944
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:45,700
<i>Oh, there are strange</i>
<i>Things happening</i>

945
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:51,739
<i>Every day</i>

946
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:12,359
There's been a lot of talk
about the new Elvis.

947
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:22,503
And of course, that other guy.

948
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,209
<i>You ain't</i>
<i>Nothin' but a hound dog</i>

949
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,878
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

950
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:35,850
<i>...at his</i>
<i>command, both civil and other,</i>

951
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:40,054
<i>to maintain public order,</i>
<i>and prevent crime and riots.</i>

952
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:41,689
<i>He can use those forces...</i>

953
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:45,225
to prevent the racial
integration of schools,

954
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:49,496
if this is necessary, under the
police powers of that state...

955
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:51,966
There's a lot of people
saying a lot of things.

956
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:53,768
<i>...in fact, it is his duty...</i>

957
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:56,104
Of course you gotta listen
to the people that you love.

958
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:59,507
<i>...and prevent</i>
<i>turmoil</i>
<i>and strife within the state.</i>

959
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:03,177
But in the end,
you gotta listen to yourself.

960
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:07,414
So I want you to know,
those New York people

961
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:09,183
ain't gonna change me none.

962
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:12,720
<i>...the subversives who own...</i>

963
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:16,624
...control and dominate
the entertainment industry...

964
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:18,325
- "Trouble."
<i>... are determined...</i>

965
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,695
...to spread
Africanized culture...

966
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:24,966
I'm gonna show you what
the real Elvis is like tonight!

967
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:27,168
<i>...influencing your children...</i>

968
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:28,503
to accept the Negroes.

969
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,038
<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

970
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:32,439
-No.
-What's going on?

971
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:34,041
<i>You came to the right place</i>

972
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:37,477
<i>If you're looking</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

973
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:40,313
<i>Just look right in my face</i>

974
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,651
<i>I was born standing up</i>

975
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:47,088
<i>And talking back</i>

976
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:53,326
<i>My daddy was a green-eyed</i>
<i>Mountain jack</i>

977
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:57,598
<i>Because I'm evil</i>

978
00:54:57,665 --> 00:55:01,836
<i>My middle name is misery</i>

979
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,010
<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

980
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:14,314
<i>So don't you mess</i>
<i>around with me</i>

981
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:21,856
<i>I've never looked</i>
<i>for trouble</i>

982
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,425
<i>But I never ran</i>

983
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,563
<i>I don't take no orders</i>

984
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,364
<i>From no kind of man</i>

985
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:34,669
<i>I'm only made out</i>

986
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:37,638
<i>Of flesh, blood and bone</i>

987
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:41,374
<i>But if you're gonna</i>
<i>Start a rumble</i>

988
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:44,579
<i>Don't you try it on alone</i>

989
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:48,049
<i>Because I'm evil</i>

990
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:52,320
<i>My middle name is misery</i>

991
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,158
Elvis!

992
00:55:57,225 --> 00:56:01,629
<i>Well, I'm evil</i>

993
00:56:01,696 --> 00:56:04,198
<i>So don't you</i>
<i>mess around with me</i>

994
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:11,005
<i>I'm evil, evil</i>
<i>evil as can be</i>

995
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:15,009
<i>I'm evil</i>
<i>evil, evil as can be</i>

996
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:17,377
<i>So don't mess around</i>

997
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:19,580
<i>Don't mess around with me</i>

998
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:21,983
<i>I'm evil</i>

999
00:56:22,984 --> 00:56:24,118
<i>I'm evil</i>

1000
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:28,723
<i>Evil, evil</i>

1001
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:32,793
Uh, now would be a good time
to get back into the car.

1002
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,996
<i>I'm evil</i>

1003
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,463
<i>Evil</i>

1004
00:56:36,964 --> 00:56:38,666
<i>Evil</i>

1005
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:44,939
Our friends at RCA
are not gonna
be happy when they see this.

1006
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:02,455
<i>He didn't listen</i>
<i>to me.</i>

1007
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:04,959
<i>Why?</i>

1008
00:57:05,026 --> 00:57:08,362
<i>Why didn't he listen to me?</i>

1009
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,965
<i>I'm evil</i>

1010
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,602
Get my boy off that stage!

1011
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,938
<i>...with me</i>

1012
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:23,544
Get your hands
off him. Hey!

1013
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:25,813
Hey, Elvis!

1014
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,929
Elvis!

1015
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:44,665
Go look after the merchandise.
Look after the merchandise!

1016
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,536
Elvis, come on!

1017
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:50,237
Get off of me!
Mama, you get in the car!

1018
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:52,073
Get in the car!

1019
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,117
You're gonna get us in trouble.

1020
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,753
He's all right, come on.

1021
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,055
- Elvis!
- Scotty, come on.

1022
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:09,156
Let's go.

1023
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,773
<i>My dear boy</i>
<i>had chosen.</i>

1024
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,511
<i>You, his audience, his fans.</i>

1025
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:35,182
<i>He had no idea</i>
<i>what he had done</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

1026
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:36,917
<i>We warned you, Colonel.</i>

1027
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,719
<i>You've lost control</i>
<i>of this act of yours.</i>

1028
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:40,454
<i>And he's dividing this nation.</i>

1029
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:45,026
<i>There are a lot of people</i>
<i>who want to see him in jail.</i>

1030
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:47,561
<i>I had to find</i>
<i>a way out.</i>

1031
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:50,564
<i>A way to save him.</i>

1032
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:58,639
<i>Crawfish</i>

1033
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:03,644
<i>Crawfish</i>

1034
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:10,885
No. There's no way my baby's
going to Germany for two years.

1035
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:15,022
It is either the army or jail.

1036
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:17,925
There is something else.

1037
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:21,762
Vernon, they are poking
into your background.

1038
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:23,564
We don't have nothin'
to be ashamed of!

1039
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,166
Now, my daddy is a good man.

1040
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:28,369
Yes, yes.
But your papa did go to jail.

1041
00:59:28,436 --> 00:59:31,439
You know them,
and their flashy headlines.

1042
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:35,709
"Elvis, The Draft Dodger."
"A Family of Delinquents."

1043
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,679
<i>There was no moon</i>

1044
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:42,750
We may never
book another date,
or sell another record again.

1045
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,351
And my way of thinking,

1046
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,921
the army could be
a brand new start
for all of us.

1047
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:48,656
<i>Let them cut your hair.</i>

1048
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:52,059
Prove to the world that you are
a clean-cut, all-American boy.

1049
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:55,129
<i>You do your two years, and when</i>
<i>you come back, I promise you</i>

1050
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,831
<i>I will have done</i>
<i>everything I can</i>

1051
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:59,700
<i>to make you the biggest</i>
<i>actor in Hollywood.</i>

1052
00:59:59,767 --> 01:00:01,669
You will choose
your own pictures.

1053
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:04,905
It's gonna be okay, Mama.

1054
01:00:04,972 --> 01:00:09,310
<i>And I pulled Mr. Crawfish</i>
<i>out of his hole</i>

1055
01:00:09,376 --> 01:00:11,212
<i>Young Mr. Presley,</i>
<i>a rock and roller no more.</i>

1056
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:14,715
<i>He'll do six months'</i>
<i>basic training at Fort Chaffee</i>

1057
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:16,784
<i>before shipping off to Germany.</i>

1058
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:20,187
<i>Since the day</i>
<i>he was born,</i>

1059
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:23,124
<i>she had feared</i>
<i>losing her second son.</i>

1060
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:28,929
<i>While he was</i>
<i>in basic training...</i>

1061
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:32,233
<i>she worried and drank...</i>

1062
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:35,202
<i>Worried...</i>

1063
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,738
<i>and drank.</i>

1064
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,281
Hey...

1065
01:00:47,348 --> 01:00:48,716
Alberta!

1066
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:14,576
Oh, no...

1067
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:16,243
No!

1068
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:24,451
There are some fine folks
from the press waiting outside.

1069
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,624
A few questions, pictures,
and they will leave us alone.

1070
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,793
I can't get him to do anything.

1071
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:36,830
He trusted her
like nobody else,

1072
01:01:36,897 --> 01:01:40,768
and now she's gone
and who does he have now?

1073
01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:43,704
Well...

1074
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:46,840
He trusts you.

1075
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:49,109
Can you talk to him?

1076
01:01:50,211 --> 01:01:52,079
Oh, no.

1077
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,949
It's not my place...

1078
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,817
Can you do it, Colonel?

1079
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,953
We need your help now.

1080
01:02:09,096 --> 01:02:11,832
Your daddy is doing
the best he knows how,

1081
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:14,969
but he is overwhelmed.

1082
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:17,204
He needs your help out there.

1083
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:21,075
I can't go out there.
I just wanna stay here forever.

1084
01:02:21,141 --> 01:02:23,277
Oh, my boy.

1085
01:02:23,344 --> 01:02:26,648
No one could never
replace her.

1086
01:02:26,715 --> 01:02:28,617
But you listen to me.

1087
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:32,152
From this moment on,
anything she would have done...

1088
01:02:32,987 --> 01:02:35,956
I will carry out, in her name.

1089
01:02:36,023 --> 01:02:41,262
When you are overseas,
I will stay here at home.

1090
01:02:41,328 --> 01:02:44,999
And I will work,
and I will worry.

1091
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,536
Trust me.

1092
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,908
Now, you go and you stand
by your papa.

1093
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,377
You comfort him.

1094
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:59,046
You comfort him.

1095
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:01,415
Comfort your friends
and your family,

1096
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:03,551
and even your fans. Hmm?

1097
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:06,920
Because if you don't do that...

1098
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:09,890
all that your mama
has sacrificed for you

1099
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:11,959
will be for nothing.

1100
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:17,164
No matter what happens,

1101
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:19,900
you stay with me
through thick and thin, okay?

1102
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:23,337
You're like a...
like a father to me.

1103
01:03:58,205 --> 01:04:01,308
<i>I needed</i>
<i>to protect him.</i>

1104
01:04:04,512 --> 01:04:06,413
<i>Even from himself.</i>

1105
01:04:11,485 --> 01:04:15,724
<i>My plan, Elvis Presley</i>
<i>would return</i>

1106
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:20,194
<i>a clean-cut, all-American boy.</i>

1107
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:22,863
<i>But...</i>

1108
01:04:25,065 --> 01:04:26,333
<i>...I did not consider</i>

1109
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,136
<i>the most dangerous thing</i>
<i>of all.</i>

1110
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:33,340
<i>Love.</i>

1111
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,720
<i>Priscilla,</i>
<i>the pretty teenage daughter</i>

1112
01:04:45,787 --> 01:04:49,524
<i>of a United States</i>
<i>Air Force officer.</i>

1113
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:53,894
And then he said to me...

1114
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:57,030
"You know what, Priscilla?

1115
01:04:57,097 --> 01:04:58,700
You gotta listen to me,
sweetie,

1116
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:01,368
because this guy, he's got
girls all over the world, okay?

1117
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,103
He's got girls waiting
outside of his house

1118
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,873
and girls writing him
endless fan mail."

1119
01:05:04,938 --> 01:05:07,341
And then Mommy decides
to pitch in and go,

1120
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:09,577
"Ooh, what could he possibly
see in you, okay?

1121
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:11,679
What do you two do
up there all night?"

1122
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:13,247
And--

1123
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:17,619
And I just said, "Mom, Dad...

1124
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:20,889
we talk and we listen
to music, okay? That's all."

1125
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:23,457
And then they were going on
and on about that photo of you

1126
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:26,126
and Natalie Wood riding around
on that bike in Memphis,

1127
01:05:26,193 --> 01:05:28,530
and...
and then what I said...

1128
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:31,833
And I said this really calmly,
I said, "Listen, okay?

1129
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,470
He's just really lonely.
And quite frankly, so am I."

1130
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:41,008
And then
they didn't really know
what to say after that,

1131
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:44,579
so I went upstairs
and I went to bed.

1132
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:47,047
Never met anyone like you.

1133
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:48,449
Well, I hope not.

1134
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:53,954
So... what
is Natalie Wood like?

1135
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,423
She's nice, you know.

1136
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,258
She's been writing me
about acting.

1137
01:05:58,325 --> 01:06:00,662
I've been asking her
stories about...

1138
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:02,630
working with James Dean and...

1139
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:05,232
God, I just hope to one day
be as good as him, you know?

1140
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,266
Mmm.

1141
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:13,407
Colonel's promised me
that when I get back

1142
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:16,176
he's gonna set me up
in Hollywood
to be a serious actor.

1143
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:22,517
That's really what I dream of.

1144
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:25,986
Hey, E.P., E.P.,
now, you promised the captain

1145
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:28,455
that you'd get her home
by 7:00.

1146
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:30,625
Hey, Charlie.
What's that behind you?

1147
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:32,292
What? No...

1148
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,329
He don't boss me around.

1149
01:06:49,844 --> 01:06:52,580
You know, I think
if you dream it, you'll do it.

1150
01:06:53,982 --> 01:06:55,282
You do?

1151
01:06:56,618 --> 01:06:58,887
Yeah.

1152
01:07:00,955 --> 01:07:05,259
<i>Shall I stay?</i>

1153
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:12,399
<i>Would it be a sin</i>

1154
01:07:14,802 --> 01:07:20,374
<i>If I can't help</i>

1155
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:27,080
<i>Falling in love with you?</i>

1156
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:32,854
<i>You no longer</i>
<i>want to sing in your films,</i>

1157
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:35,222
<i>is that right?</i>
<i>You want to be</i>
<i>a dramatic actor.</i>

1158
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:37,324
<i>Well, sir, that's</i>
<i>my big ambition now.</i>

1159
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:40,460
<i>It takes a lot of time,</i>
<i>a lot of experience.</i>

1160
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:44,464
<i>He was</i>
<i>as good as Brando.</i>

1161
01:07:44,532 --> 01:07:48,736
<i>But you didn't want to see him</i>
<i>in movies where he didn't sing.</i>

1162
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:50,437
<i>A little less conversation</i>

1163
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:52,974
<i>A little more action</i>

1164
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:57,077
<i>All this aggravation</i>
<i>Ain't satisfactioning me</i>

1165
01:07:57,144 --> 01:08:03,618
<i>Thanks to me, his life</i>
<i>became one big Hollywood movie!</i>

1166
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:06,086
<i>Starring Priscilla...</i>

1167
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:08,488
<i>Bright light city</i>
<i>gonna set my soul</i>

1168
01:08:08,556 --> 01:08:10,925
<i>Gonna set my soul on fire</i>

1169
01:08:10,992 --> 01:08:14,662
<i>And a cast</i>
<i>of his "buddies" and "cousins."</i>

1170
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:16,463
<i>His Memphis Mafia.</i>

1171
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:18,600
<i>So get those stakes</i>
<i>up higher</i>

1172
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:22,537
<i>There's a thousand</i>
<i>pretty women</i>
<i>Waitin' out there</i>

1173
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:25,640
<i>And they're all livin'</i>
<i>The devil may care</i>

1174
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:29,142
<i>And I'm just the devil</i>
<i>With love to spare, so</i>

1175
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:32,112
<i>Viva, Las Vegas</i>

1176
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:35,617
<i>There was that</i>
<i>fairytale wedding.</i>

1177
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:38,519
<i>And the honeymoon</i>
<i>on Frank Sinatra's jet.</i>

1178
01:08:38,586 --> 01:08:42,757
<i>And introducing</i>
<i>Baby Lisa Marie.</i>

1179
01:08:42,824 --> 01:08:47,895
<i>I made him the highest paid</i>
<i>actor in Hollywood history.</i>

1180
01:08:47,962 --> 01:08:49,530
<i>We had a lot of fun!</i>

1181
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,133
<i>But Elvis was a young man,</i>

1182
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,536
<i>and of course,</i>
<i>he got distracted.</i>

1183
01:08:55,603 --> 01:09:00,642
<i>So we made them faster</i>
<i>and cheaper.</i>

1184
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,510
<i>Beatlemania sweeps America,</i>

1185
01:09:02,577 --> 01:09:05,580
<i>as teens turn their attention</i>
<i>to the teenage rockers.</i>

1186
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:10,018
<i>Is it my fault</i>
<i>the world changed?</i>

1187
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:15,990
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,</i>

1188
01:09:16,057 --> 01:09:19,292
<i>the apostle of non-violence</i>
<i>in the Civil Rights movement,</i>

1189
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,596
<i>has been shot to death</i>
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

1190
01:09:38,046 --> 01:09:40,882
<i>New Elvis stinker</i>
<i>bombs, another flop.</i>

1191
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:44,484
<i>There's no more appetite</i>
<i>for Presley pictures.</i>

1192
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:47,187
<i>It don't matter</i>
<i>how hard I worked,</i>

1193
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:50,091
<i>how many snow jobs</i>
<i>I came up with,</i>

1194
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,160
<i>how much snow I made them.</i>

1195
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:54,461
<i>My boy loved to spend.</i>

1196
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:57,165
<i>And with them hillbillies</i>
<i>around him,</i>

1197
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,333
<i>the money would just melt away.</i>

1198
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,104
With the sale of the ranch
and the horses,

1199
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:04,505
that's gonna cover the payroll,

1200
01:10:04,572 --> 01:10:06,774
but as for the security
at Graceland...

1201
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:08,710
<i>Officers also reportedly chased</i>

1202
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:10,511
<i>and fired on</i>
<i>a radio-equipped car</i>

1203
01:10:10,578 --> 01:10:12,479
<i>containing two white men.</i>

1204
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:14,716
<i>Dr. King was standing</i>
<i>on the balcony</i>

1205
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:17,151
<i>of his second floor</i>
<i>hotel room tonight,</i>

1206
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,920
<i>when, according to a companion,</i>

1207
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:21,656
<i>a shot was fired</i>
<i>from across the street.</i>

1208
01:10:22,222 --> 01:10:23,423
Dr. King.

1209
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:24,424
Uncle Vernon,
come quick!

1210
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:25,893
He always spoke the truth.

1211
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,662
What happened?

1212
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:29,630
<i>They rushed the 39-year-old</i>
<i>Negro leader to a hospital,</i>

1213
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:32,365
<i>where he died of a bullet wound</i>
<i>in the neck.</i>

1214
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:33,801
<i>Jingle, jingles...</i>

1215
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:36,269
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

1216
01:10:36,336 --> 01:10:38,606
<i>Right down Santa Claus Lane</i>

1217
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:40,842
<i>Vixen and Blitzen</i>
<i>And all the reindeer</i>

1218
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,176
<i>Pulling on the rein</i>

1219
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:44,746
Elvis Presley's
<i>Wonderful World of Christmas.</i>

1220
01:10:44,812 --> 01:10:45,680
Brought to you by

1221
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:47,615
the Singer Sewing Machine
Company,

1222
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:49,984
to every television set
in America.

1223
01:10:50,051 --> 01:10:52,019
It only takes three days
to tape,

1224
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,087
and there's no audience.

1225
01:10:53,154 --> 01:10:54,789
<i>Violence breeds violence,</i>

1226
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:56,591
<i>- repression breeds retaliation.</i>
- ...Christmas sweater.

1227
01:10:56,657 --> 01:10:59,894
Made on the new Singer,
home knitting apparatus.

1228
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:02,997
-Memphis is burning.
<i>-...and to fear his brother.</i>

1229
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:05,666
<i>When you teach</i>
<i>that he is a lesser man</i>

1230
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:08,401
<i>because of his color</i>
<i>or his beliefs...</i>

1231
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:10,303
...dreaming
of a white Christmas,

1232
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:13,508
because, oh,
it's definitely going to snow.

1233
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:15,342
Christmas special.

1234
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:17,410
Is this the best we can do,
Admiral?

1235
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:19,479
Well, we took
the Hollywood phonies

1236
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:20,948
for every nickel they had

1237
01:11:21,015 --> 01:11:23,450
and now it is time
for us to pack up our tents

1238
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:25,485
and move on
to even greener pastures.

1239
01:11:25,553 --> 01:11:27,221
We've seen "Elvis the Rebel,"

1240
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:28,923
we've seen
"Elvis the Movie Star."

1241
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:32,660
Now we will see
"Elvis the Family Entertainer."

1242
01:11:32,727 --> 01:11:34,461
And appliance salesman?

1243
01:11:36,496 --> 01:11:38,465
What did you say?

1244
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,902
Listen, Jerry,
I don't need you to question me

1245
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:44,272
about how I support my family
and every goddamn person here.

1246
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:45,807
You understand me?

1247
01:11:45,873 --> 01:11:47,875
If you don't like it,
you can go back to Memphis.

1248
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:51,779
Laugh it up, assholes.

1249
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:09,197
<i>What</i>
<i>a beautiful rendition</i>

1250
01:12:09,263 --> 01:12:11,699
<i>of "Here Comes Santa Claus"</i>
<i>that was,</i>

1251
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:15,036
<i>with all the sparkle and magic</i>
<i>that the season brings.</i>

1252
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:17,071
<i>And you'll be even warmer</i>
<i>this season</i>

1253
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:19,941
<i>in a 12 gauge</i>
<i>cable-knit woolen sweater...</i>

1254
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,809
-Satnin?
-Hi.

1255
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:24,344
<i>...made right at home</i>
<i>on the Singer Sewer</i>
<i>SK155 home knitter.</i>

1256
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:27,048
<i>And now, here's Elvis!</i>

1257
01:12:30,852 --> 01:12:33,054
Can I watch the memorial
with you?

1258
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,589
Yeah, baby.

1259
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:45,032
I'm so tired of playing
Elvis Presley.

1260
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:47,434
Too many people rely on me.

1261
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:52,439
I love you.

1262
01:12:52,506 --> 01:12:54,542
And your daughter loves you.

1263
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:59,180
We don't care about the money
or anything else.

1264
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:00,848
We just want you to be happy.

1265
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:02,717
<i>Lord, hold my hand</i>

1266
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:04,384
<i>And don't let me fall</i>

1267
01:13:04,451 --> 01:13:08,256
You're only really happy when
you sing the music you love.

1268
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:12,293
<i>Oh</i>

1269
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,596
<i>Take my hand</i>

1270
01:13:15,663 --> 01:13:18,532
Mahalia Jackson.

1271
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:21,168
I used to hear her sing
at East Street Church.

1272
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:24,672
<i>Got a feelin' in my body</i>

1273
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:26,774
That's the music
that makes me happy.

1274
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:32,246
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1275
01:13:32,313 --> 01:13:36,951
So when things are too
dangerous to say... sing!

1276
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:47,395
<i>When Moses walked the children</i>
<i>out of Egypt land</i>

1277
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:52,166
<i>He said "Now don't you worry</i>
<i>we're in the lord's hands"</i>

1278
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:56,137
<i>I got a feelin' in my body</i>

1279
01:13:56,203 --> 01:13:59,472
<i>This will be our lucky day</i>

1280
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:06,681
<i>We'll be released</i>
<i>from all our sorrow</i>

1281
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:10,051
<i>Leave it layin' along the way</i>

1282
01:14:18,059 --> 01:14:20,995
<i>You gotta meet these</i>
<i>Binder and Bones guys, E.P.</i>

1283
01:14:21,062 --> 01:14:22,430
<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>that put James Brown,</i>

1284
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:24,932
<i>the Rolling Stones onstage.</i>

1285
01:14:24,999 --> 01:14:26,767
<i>They're doing some</i>
<i>cutting edge stuff.</i>

1286
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:31,172
Mr. Binder, Mr. Howe...
thanks for coming.

1287
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:49,623
When I first came
to Hollywood, I'd come up here

1288
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:51,926
and sit for hours.

1289
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:53,761
Right over there,
the observatory...

1290
01:14:53,828 --> 01:14:56,430
that's where they shot
<i>Rebel Without a Cause.</i>

1291
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:01,702
Man, I used to dream of being
a great actor like Jimmy Dean.

1292
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:04,038
This sign was beautiful then.

1293
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,975
And now...

1294
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:11,178
Feels as though lots of things
are like that these days.

1295
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:14,215
Broke down, beat up.

1296
01:15:15,082 --> 01:15:16,083
Rotten.

1297
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:19,987
I really like
what you guys did,

1298
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:22,656
putting James Brown
and the Stones together.

1299
01:15:22,723 --> 01:15:26,093
We're, uh...
big fans of yours, too.

1300
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,929
It's just that, Mr. Presley,
we don't usually--

1301
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:30,264
Oh, Elvis.

1302
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:31,866
Elvis, uh...

1303
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:36,137
Christmas specials
aren't really our thing.

1304
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,571
I know.

1305
01:15:39,273 --> 01:15:41,342
Tell me, honestly...

1306
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:44,111
where do you boys
think my career's at right now?

1307
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,648
Well, it's...

1308
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:50,684
It's in the toilet, Elvis.

1309
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,459
You hear that, Jerry?

1310
01:15:58,527 --> 01:16:01,929
Oh, Lord. I knew you were
the right guys for this job.

1311
01:16:01,996 --> 01:16:04,498
You know,
back when I was starting out,

1312
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:06,934
some people wanted
to put me in jail,

1313
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:10,337
even kill me,
'cause of the way I was moving.

1314
01:16:12,507 --> 01:16:14,008
So they cut my hair,

1315
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:17,178
they put me in uniform
and they sent me away.

1316
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:21,882
That killed my mother.

1317
01:16:24,819 --> 01:16:26,854
And ever since then...

1318
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:29,890
I've been lost.

1319
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:35,029
And when you're lost,
people take advantage.

1320
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:41,368
I need you fellas to help me
get back to who I really am.

1321
01:16:42,571 --> 01:16:43,971
And who are you, Elvis?

1322
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,609
I sure as hell ain't somebody
who sings Christmas songs

1323
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:51,546
by a fireplace for an hour.

1324
01:16:51,612 --> 01:16:54,048
And what
does the Colonel think?

1325
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:56,717
I don't give a damn
what the Colonel thinks.

1326
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:13,267
For this television special,

1327
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:16,103
we've got this Bindle fella,
number one hotshot director.

1328
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:19,240
Elvis will be humoring him by
doing a few of his fresh ideas.

1329
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:20,808
Ah, the sweater!

1330
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,377
To Mr. Presley's
dressing room, please.

1331
01:17:23,444 --> 01:17:26,981
We are going to sing three
spectacular Christmas songs

1332
01:17:27,047 --> 01:17:29,316
in that very sweater.

1333
01:17:31,051 --> 01:17:34,121
Now, when that sign lights up,
what do you do?

1334
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:35,956
Applause.

1335
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,996
"Silent is the Night"
and "Deck the Halls,"

1336
01:17:42,062 --> 01:17:45,366
and, uh...
"Whose Child Is This?"

1337
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:47,602
<i>You think</i>
<i>we can do some gospel?</i>

1338
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,136
Well, if you want
to find yourself,

1339
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:50,938
first thing you do is go home.

1340
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:54,576
Metaphorically, you know.
Get back to who you really are.

1341
01:17:54,643 --> 01:17:56,443
And what is the boy that--

1342
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,379
-Oh, "The Little Drummer Boy"?
-Yes, "The Little
Drumming Boy."

1343
01:17:58,445 --> 01:17:59,947
Oh, the... with the...

1344
01:18:00,014 --> 01:18:01,982
<i>We get your old band</i>
<i>back together.</i>

1345
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:05,886
But we are going to start with
"Here Comes Santa Claus,"

1346
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:07,622
isn't that right, Mr. Bindle?

1347
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:09,456
Uh, the Christmas specials
come later in the show.

1348
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:10,858
Can you bring up two?

1349
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:12,693
<i>A leather jacket.</i>
<i>Raw, dirty.</i>

1350
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,030
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
this is television, not radio,

1351
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:17,731
so when that goes up
and you clap,

1352
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:18,933
let's see it
on your faces as well.

1353
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:21,769
<i>But you need</i>
<i>an audience.</i>

1354
01:18:21,835 --> 01:18:23,337
<i>Audience?</i>

1355
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:25,272
- Bring it over to one.
<i>- At any second now,</i>

1356
01:18:25,339 --> 01:18:27,274
Elvis is gonna walk onto this
stage and perform just for you.

1357
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:29,644
<i>I ain't sang in front</i>
<i>of an audience in a long time.</i>

1358
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,078
<i>That's my point.</i>

1359
01:18:31,145 --> 01:18:34,381
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Elvis Presley!

1360
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:14,955
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

1361
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:17,491
<i>Well, I found a new place</i>
<i>To dwell</i>

1362
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:19,728
<i>Well, it's down at the end</i>
<i>Of Lonely Street</i>

1363
01:19:19,827 --> 01:19:22,096
<i>At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

1364
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:25,799
<i>Where I'll be</i>
<i>I'll be so lonely, baby</i>

1365
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:28,135
<i>I'll be so lonely</i>

1366
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:32,106
<i>I'll be so lonely</i>
<i>I could die</i>

1367
01:19:32,172 --> 01:19:35,276
<i>Well, the bellhop's tears</i>
<i>Keep flowin'</i>

1368
01:19:35,342 --> 01:19:38,012
<i>And the desk clerk's</i>
<i>Dressed in black</i>

1369
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:40,414
<i>Well, they've been so long</i>
<i>On Lonely Street</i>

1370
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:44,218
<i>Well, they'll never</i>
<i>They'll never look back</i>

1371
01:19:44,285 --> 01:19:46,554
<i>They'll be so lonely, baby</i>

1372
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:49,056
<i>They'll be so lonely</i>

1373
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:51,559
<i>They'll be so lonely</i>
<i>They could die</i>

1374
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:58,365
Well, that was... energetic.

1375
01:20:00,301 --> 01:20:03,037
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

1376
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:05,105
<i>Snoopin' at my door</i>

1377
01:20:05,172 --> 01:20:07,808
<i>You ain't nothin'</i>
<i>But a hound dog</i>

1378
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,344
<i>Cryin' all the time</i>

1379
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:12,146
<i>Well, you ain't never</i>
<i>Caught a rabbit</i>

1380
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:15,115
<i>You ain't no friend of mine</i>

1381
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:16,884
Come on!

1382
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,054
Colonel...

1383
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,423
Is "Here Comes
Santa Claus" next?

1384
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:23,991
Absolutely.

1385
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:26,493
I see no reason why not.

1386
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:30,264
He's not in the swe-- he's not
even wearing the sweater.

1387
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:33,367
<i>Well, it's one for the money</i>
<i>Two for the show</i>

1388
01:20:33,434 --> 01:20:35,436
<i>Three to get ready</i>
<i>Now go, cat, go</i>

1389
01:20:35,503 --> 01:20:40,040
<i>But don't you</i>
<i>Step on my blue suede shoes</i>

1390
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:42,409
I do not know
what is going on.

1391
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:43,545
Singing "Hound Dog"?

1392
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:45,513
What does that have to do
with Christmas?

1393
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,182
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

1394
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:50,618
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Baby</i>

1395
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:52,787
<i>Blue, blue, blue suede shoes</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

1396
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:54,789
<i>Blue, blue</i>
<i>blue suede shoes</i>

1397
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:56,256
<i>Well, you can do anything</i>

1398
01:20:56,323 --> 01:20:58,959
<i>But lay off of my</i>
<i>Blue suede shoes</i>

1399
01:21:03,063 --> 01:21:04,666
Young man, you tell them

1400
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:06,735
it's time for "Here Comes
Santa Claus." I said so. Now!

1401
01:21:06,801 --> 01:21:08,636
All right. First positions!

1402
01:21:11,271 --> 01:21:13,641
<i>Warden threw a party</i>
<i>In the county jail</i>

1403
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,243
<i>The prison band was there</i>
<i>And they began to wail</i>

1404
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,079
<i>The band was jumping</i>
<i>And the joint began to swing</i>

1405
01:21:19,146 --> 01:21:21,348
<i>You shoulda heard</i>
<i>Those knocked out</i>
<i>jailbirds sing</i>

1406
01:21:21,415 --> 01:21:25,953
<i>Let's rock</i>
<i>All right, everybody,</i>
<i>let's rock</i>

1407
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:28,922
<i>Everybody in the whole</i>
<i>Cell block</i>

1408
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:31,392
<i>Was dancing to the</i>
<i>Jailhouse Rock</i>

1409
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:36,397
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

1410
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:40,568
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>
<i>Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock</i>

1411
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:44,572
<i>They were dancin'</i>

1412
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,775
<i>Well, they were dancin'</i>

1413
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:49,744
<i>To the Jailhouse Rock</i>

1414
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,412
Hah!

1415
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:53,548
All right.

1416
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,624
It's been a long time, baby.

1417
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,358
A long time.

1418
01:22:20,508 --> 01:22:22,176
<i>Well, I like a lot</i>
<i>of the new groups,</i>

1419
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:25,680
<i>you know, the Beatles</i>
<i>and the Byrds, but,</i>

1420
01:22:25,747 --> 01:22:28,482
a lot of it is basically--

1421
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:30,785
rock and roll music
is basically, uh...

1422
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:32,821
gospel or rhythm and blues.

1423
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:37,057
Well, that's one thing about
this TV special that I'm doing,

1424
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:39,928
<i>they're gonna let me do</i>
<i>what I want to do.</i>

1425
01:22:40,027 --> 01:22:42,095
<i>Sing the music that I want.</i>

1426
01:22:42,162 --> 01:22:43,997
Music that I love.

1427
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,402
Music that makes me happy.

1428
01:22:54,341 --> 01:22:58,713
<i>Those know-it-all</i>
<i>hippies had brainwashed Elvis,</i>

1429
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:01,448
<i>acting like he was</i>
<i>one of them radicals,</i>

1430
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:04,351
<i>throwing his career away</i>
<i>to sing spirituals</i>

1431
01:23:04,418 --> 01:23:06,220
<i>with a bunch of longhairs.</i>

1432
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:15,663
Bindle...

1433
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,297
-Cue the gospel number now. Go.
-"Here Comes Santa Claus."

1434
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:19,299
<i>Up above my head</i>

1435
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:24,506
<i>There is music in the air</i>

1436
01:23:24,572 --> 01:23:25,673
No.

1437
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,575
<i>Up above my head</i>

1438
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:31,913
All right, none of this
will be in the special.

1439
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:34,481
Can you make a note that
that should be in the special?

1440
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:40,120
Okay, now let's segue straight
into the whorehouse dancers.
Go!

1441
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:42,524
Whorehouse? No.

1442
01:23:45,058 --> 01:23:47,327
Now bring in
the kung fu spectacular.

1443
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:50,565
What? Kung fu?

1444
01:23:50,632 --> 01:23:52,634
<i>If you ever take a trip</i>
<i>Down to the ocean</i>

1445
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,570
<i>Find yourself down</i>
<i>around Mobile</i>

1446
01:23:55,637 --> 01:23:58,138
This has nothing
to do with Christmas!

1447
01:23:58,205 --> 01:24:00,340
You'll be hearing
from our lawyers.

1448
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:02,109
But, we still have
"Here Comes Santa Claus"!

1449
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:04,311
Santa Claus is bringing you
a lawsuit!

1450
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:05,580
<i>Digging the finest</i>
<i>Little five-piece group</i>

<i>That five-piece band</i>

1453
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:11,184
<i>Well, wouldn't you know</i>

1454
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:12,887
<i>It's that swinging little</i>
<i>Guitar man</i>

<i>Get the gun. Get the gun.</i>

1467
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:55,897
<i>Take a hold of his thumb</i>

<i>Get his gun!</i>

1469
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:58,766
We're ready on set.

1470
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:02,003
Oh, my God.

1471
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:15,482
<i>...Senator Kennedy</i>

1476
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:26,794

01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:37,204
Listen, I, uh...

1480
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:39,874
I just want to say that...

1481
01:25:41,274 --> 01:25:43,511
...that this nation is hurting.

1482
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:45,880
It's lost. You know? It...

1483
01:25:45,947 --> 01:25:50,250
It needs a voice right now
to help it heal.

1484
01:25:52,185 --> 01:25:53,888
We have to say something.

1485
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:56,456
You...

1486
01:25:56,524 --> 01:25:59,459
have to make
a statement, E.P.

1487
01:25:59,527 --> 01:26:03,230
Mr. Presley does not
make statements.

1488
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:07,200
He sings
"Here Comes Santa Claus"

1489
01:26:07,267 --> 01:26:08,970
and wishes everyone,

1490
01:26:09,037 --> 01:26:11,673
"Merry Christmas
and good night."

1491
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:15,242
<i>...Senator Kennedy's</i>
<i>press secretary</i>

1493
01:26:17,512 --> 01:26:20,447
<i>Some five to ten minutes later,</i>
<i>the operation began.</i>

1494
01:26:20,515 --> 01:26:22,850
<i>The six-man team</i>
<i>of neurosurgeons</i>

1495
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,451
<i>probing for the bullet</i>
<i>that had lodged</i>

1496
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:26,087

<i>No report yet</i>

1498
01:26:28,656 --> 01:26:30,892
Poor Mrs. Kennedy.

1499
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:32,727
This tragedy...

1500
01:26:33,695 --> 01:26:35,563
A tragedy.

1501
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,932
But it has nothing
to do with us.

1502
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:41,636
<i>The White House</i>
<i>has reacted to the shooting...</i>

1503
01:26:41,703 --> 01:26:44,038
It has everything
to do with us.

1504
01:26:44,105 --> 01:26:47,474
No, I just do not think

1505
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:50,678
we should be making speeches
about politics and religion.

1506
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:53,413
Dr. King was shot
eight miles from Graceland

1507
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,984
while I was out here
singing to turtles.

1508
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:59,386
And now this, and all you can
think about is how many

1509
01:26:59,453 --> 01:27:01,556
goddamn sweaters I can sell?

1510
01:27:01,622 --> 01:27:03,524
I am a promoter.
That is what I do.

1511
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:05,893
And I'm Elvis Presley.
That's what I do.

1512
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,696
Well, Mr. Bindle has really
gotten inside your head

1513
01:27:08,763 --> 01:27:10,698
with all of his hippie friends.

1514
01:27:10,765 --> 01:27:13,101
You actually think that
you singing your old songs

1515
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:14,736
dressed in black leather,

1516
01:27:14,802 --> 01:27:17,905
sweating, mumbling incoherently
to the audience

1517
01:27:17,972 --> 01:27:19,372
was a good show?

1518
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:21,408
Colonel, I know when
I've excited an audience.

1519
01:27:21,475 --> 01:27:23,845
That was not a real audience,
my boy.

1520
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:25,880
There was a sign
flashing "applaud,"

1521
01:27:25,947 --> 01:27:27,715
telling them
when to clap for you.

1522
01:27:27,782 --> 01:27:30,852
This entire jamboree
is an embarrassment.

1523
01:27:31,953 --> 01:27:33,386
You have embarrassed
the sponsors,

1524
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:34,655
you have embarrassed yourself,

1525
01:27:34,722 --> 01:27:36,224
you have embarrassed me.

1526
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:38,760
Now, you can sing
whatever songs

1527
01:27:38,826 --> 01:27:42,029
you and Mr. Bindle choose
for 55 minutes,

1528
01:27:42,096 --> 01:27:45,733
but at the end of the show,
there will be a Christmas song.

1529
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:49,804
Or else we will be sued.

1530
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:53,107
No, you will be sued
for breach of contract,

1531
01:27:53,174 --> 01:27:56,878
because I will no longer be
the promoter of your career.

1532
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:58,646
I will have to leave you.

1533
01:28:00,748 --> 01:28:01,682
Hmm.

1534
01:28:04,218 --> 01:28:05,720
Mmm-hmm.

1535
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:15,963
Now, I have convinced
our friends

1536
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:18,566
at Singer Sewing Machines
to come back tomorrow

1537
01:28:18,633 --> 01:28:20,935
for "Here Comes Santa Claus."

1538
01:28:21,002 --> 01:28:24,505
I will see you in the morning,
Mr. Presley.

1539
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:26,240
Oh, and as I recall,

1540
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:28,709
Dr. King said
rock and roll music

1541
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:31,546
contributed
to juvenile delinquency.

1542
01:28:31,612 --> 01:28:33,047
<i>It would be wrong,</i>

1543
01:28:33,114 --> 01:28:34,447
<i>it would be self-deceptive</i>

1544
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:36,083
<i>to ignore the connection</i>

1545
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:38,553
<i>between that lawlessness</i>
<i>and hatred</i>

1546
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:40,755
<i>and this act of violence.</i>

1547
01:28:40,822 --> 01:28:42,657
<i>It would be just as wrong</i>

1548
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:45,927
<i>and just as self-deceptive</i>
<i>to conclude from this act</i>

1549
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:48,529
<i>that our country</i>
<i>itself is sick,</i>

1550
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,131
<i>that it's lost its balance,</i>

1551
01:28:50,198 --> 01:28:53,000
<i>that it's lost its sense</i>
<i>of direction,</i>

1552
01:28:53,067 --> 01:28:55,203
<i>even its common decency.</i>

1553
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:56,804
<i>200 million Americans</i>

1554
01:28:56,871 --> 01:29:00,274
<i>did not strike down</i>
<i>Robert Kennedy last night,</i>

1555
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,676
<i>any more than they struck down</i>

1556
01:29:01,742 --> 01:29:05,780
<i>President John F. Kennedy</i>
<i>in 1963,</i>

1557
01:29:05,847 --> 01:29:09,283
<i>or Dr. Martin Luther King</i>
<i>in April of this year.</i>

1558
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:11,719
<i>My fellow citizens, we cannot,</i>

1559
01:29:11,786 --> 01:29:14,387
<i>we just must not tolerate</i>
<i>the sway</i>

1560
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:16,591
<i>of violent men among us.</i>

1561
01:29:16,657 --> 01:29:20,728
<i>We must not permit men</i>
<i>that are filled with hate--</i>

1562
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:34,008
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

1563
01:29:37,078 --> 01:29:41,849
<i>Here comes Santa Claus</i>

1564
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:47,588
<i>Right down Santa Claus...</i>

1565
01:29:54,829 --> 01:29:58,065
We're pretty set for the number
tomorrow, right, E.P.?

1566
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:01,468
<i>It's pretty familiar territory,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1567
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:05,940
A reverend once told me...

1568
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:10,945
"When things are too dangerous
to say...

1569
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,415
sing."

1570
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:44,145
<i>There must be lights</i>
<i>Burning brighter somewhere</i>

1571
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:50,017
<i>Got to be birds</i>
<i>flying higher</i>

1572
01:30:50,084 --> 01:30:53,486
<i>In a sky more blue</i>

1573
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,959
Standing by.
We're seconds away, folks.

1574
01:30:58,025 --> 01:30:59,660
We're just waiting on upstairs.

1575
01:30:59,727 --> 01:31:02,129
We're gonna get a rehearsal
going very shortly.

1576
01:31:02,196 --> 01:31:05,099
Let's go, let's go, people!
First positions!

1577
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:06,634
Here we go, from the top.

1578
01:31:06,701 --> 01:31:09,870
Mrs. Presley is quite
the homemaker, Priscilla is,

1579
01:31:09,937 --> 01:31:11,305
and I'm sure
she would love to have

1580
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:14,742
one of the SK551 machines
so she can knit Elvis's--

1581
01:31:14,809 --> 01:31:16,978
-They were in there all night.
-Doing what?

1582
01:31:17,044 --> 01:31:19,213
He's working on a new song.
He says he's singing it.

1583
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,815
New song? Whoa, hey!

1584
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:23,483
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas. Yes!

1585
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:25,619
Gentlemen, take your seats.

1586
01:31:27,922 --> 01:31:30,958
Now, that's
a winter wonderland.

1587
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:32,492
Mr. Bindle.

1588
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,631
You and I are
on the same page at last.

1589
01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:39,533
Bring up the lights
on the sign.

1590
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,036
Okay, yeah. Let's go.

1591
01:31:42,103 --> 01:31:44,839
Dancers, stop.
Dancers, stop. Stop!

1592
01:31:45,606 --> 01:31:48,242
Turn about. Turn about.

1593
01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:50,277
You've got to get some roll.
I got action on the right side.

1594
01:31:50,344 --> 01:31:53,114
<i>Turn around. Come on,</i>
<i>through, through, through!</i>

1595
01:31:56,417 --> 01:31:58,886
<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

1596
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:02,790
<i>With too much rain</i>

1597
01:32:03,891 --> 01:32:06,660
<i>We're trapped in a world</i>

1598
01:32:07,728 --> 01:32:11,365
<i>That's troubled with pain</i>

1599
01:32:11,432 --> 01:32:17,638
<i>But as long as a man</i>
<i>Has the strength to dream</i>

1600
01:32:17,705 --> 01:32:24,812
<i>He can redeem</i>
<i>his soul and fly</i>

1601
01:32:28,983 --> 01:32:36,657
<i>Deep in my heart</i>
<i>There's a trembling question</i>

1602
01:32:36,724 --> 01:32:40,694
<i>Still, I am sure</i>
<i>That the answer's</i>

1603
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:44,331
<i>Answer's gonna come</i>
<i>somehow</i>

1604
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:47,868
<i>Out there in the dark</i>

1605
01:32:47,935 --> 01:32:52,073
<i>There's a beckoning candle,</i>
<i>yeah</i>

1606
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:55,876
<i>And while I can think</i>
<i>While I can talk</i>

1607
01:32:55,943 --> 01:33:00,147
<i>While I can stand</i>
<i>While I can walk</i>

1608
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:03,651
<i>While I can dream</i>

1609
01:33:03,717 --> 01:33:07,788
<i>Oh, please let my dream</i>

1610
01:33:07,855 --> 01:33:11,725
<i>Come true, oh</i>

1611
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:18,899
<i>Right now</i>

1612
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:21,802
<i>Let it come true right now</i>

1613
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:36,150
<i>Thank you. Good night.</i>

1614
01:33:36,217 --> 01:33:38,752
<i>I was always said,</i>
<i>when it came to music,</i>

1615
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:40,454
<i>my boy knows best.</i>

1616
01:33:40,522 --> 01:33:45,392
<i>But the special was my idea.</i>
<i>It was a tremendous hit.</i>

1617
01:33:46,427 --> 01:33:47,995
<i>We was back on top.</i>

1618
01:33:48,062 --> 01:33:51,866
<i>But some people were</i>
<i>putting ideas into his head</i>

1619
01:33:51,932 --> 01:33:55,703
<i>that he didn't need me no more.</i>

1620
01:34:01,408 --> 01:34:02,743
Whoo-hoo!

1621
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:05,146
<i>It's working.</i>

1622
01:34:05,212 --> 01:34:06,714
<i>London, Germany,</i>
<i>Japan...</i>

1623
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,349
<i>Hulett here has got it</i>
<i>all lined up.</i>

1624
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:10,084
Air Presley's new wings.

1625
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:12,153
You know, when you
play stadiums, it's like...

1626
01:34:12,219 --> 01:34:14,088
you do a week of shows
in just one night.

1627
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:16,457
And when it's done,
you get on the plane...

1628
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:18,560
You go where you want,
you play where you want,

1629
01:34:18,627 --> 01:34:21,195
and if they don't like it,
you go someplace else.

1630
01:34:21,262 --> 01:34:23,197
You know who told me that?
B.B. King.

1631
01:34:23,264 --> 01:34:25,132
Well, B.B. knows, man.

1632
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,536
And the someplace else
you should be going
is overseas.

1633
01:34:27,602 --> 01:34:29,136
I like that.

1634
01:34:29,203 --> 01:34:31,405
You know, I heard last year
alone, you had two offers.

1635
01:34:31,472 --> 01:34:32,840
Germany and Japan,

1636
01:34:32,907 --> 01:34:35,843
for a million bucks
for one night.

1637
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:38,245
I mean, why the Colonel
would turn that down,

1638
01:34:38,312 --> 01:34:39,548
I have no idea, man.

1639
01:34:39,614 --> 01:34:42,316
Well, if you figure it out,
can you let us know?

1640
01:34:42,383 --> 01:34:43,751
Yeah.

1641
01:34:43,817 --> 01:34:44,685
Well, screw him.
You've got the plane now.

1642
01:34:44,752 --> 01:34:46,086
You should use it.

1643
01:34:46,153 --> 01:34:48,122
Yeah, come to Daddy.

1644
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,191
Maybe we should call it
the "Lisa Marie."

1645
01:34:50,257 --> 01:34:51,626
That's a beautiful name.

1646
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:52,960
Right?

1647
01:34:55,296 --> 01:34:58,332
Hit me. Hit me.

1648
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:02,937
Mr. Parker, Mr. Kohn
would like to see you.

1649
01:35:03,003 --> 01:35:05,472
Colonel Parker. Hit me.

1650
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:09,777
I can't, sorry.

1651
01:35:12,446 --> 01:35:15,049
<i>You've run up</i>
<i>quite a tab, Colonel.</i>

1652
01:35:15,115 --> 01:35:18,719
And we hear your boy's working
with new people.

1653
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:22,356
You've lost your meal ticket.

1654
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:24,659
It's time to settle up,

1655
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:27,294
before we have
to make things...

1656
01:35:27,361 --> 01:35:29,263
Uncomfortable.

1657
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:32,499
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

1658
01:35:32,567 --> 01:35:35,169
No passport, no residency.

1659
01:35:35,236 --> 01:35:38,138
You were never a colonel.
Never a Tom.

1660
01:35:38,205 --> 01:35:40,040
You weren't even a Parker.

1661
01:35:40,107 --> 01:35:45,913
Why did you flee Holland,
Andreas van Kuijk?

1662
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,185
I don't know why

1663
01:35:51,252 --> 01:35:53,020
you can't just let
the lawyers take care of it.

1664
01:35:53,087 --> 01:35:54,623
I have to see him
in Vegas.

1665
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:57,091
He's in the hospital.
It's the right thing to do.

1666
01:35:57,157 --> 01:35:58,392
-Yeah, well...
-He's frail right now.

1667
01:35:58,459 --> 01:35:59,860
You know what he's like, baby.

1668
01:35:59,927 --> 01:36:01,795
Hey! Watch it.

1669
01:36:01,862 --> 01:36:03,665
You know what he's like.
The second that
you're near him,

1670
01:36:03,732 --> 01:36:06,200
you'll be under ten feet
of snow before you know
what's happened.

1671
01:36:06,267 --> 01:36:09,504
My mind's made up.
Business is business.

1672
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:10,871
He and I are done.

1673
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:12,641
But I owe it to him
to tell him to his face.

1674
01:36:12,707 --> 01:36:16,443
Well, just make sure he
doesn't clip your wings, honey.

1675
01:36:16,511 --> 01:36:18,112
He won't!

1676
01:36:18,178 --> 01:36:20,715
I am gonna go
see him in Vegas.

1677
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:25,486
I'm gonna look him in the eyes,
and I'm gonna tell him...

1678
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:27,722
- Watch my hair.
- I'm gonna tell him...

1679
01:36:27,788 --> 01:36:29,290
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

1680
01:36:30,692 --> 01:36:31,792
...it's over.

1681
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:39,501
<i>You break it, you burn it</i>

1682
01:36:39,567 --> 01:36:42,403
<i>Drag it all around</i>

1683
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:44,773
You twist it and turn it

1684
01:36:44,838 --> 01:36:47,207
<i>You cannot tear it down</i>

1685
01:36:47,274 --> 01:36:50,044
<i>'Cause every minute,</i>
<i>every hour you'll be shaken</i>

1686
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:52,747
<i>By the strength</i>
<i>and mighty power of my love</i>

1687
01:36:52,813 --> 01:36:54,549
Colonel doesn't want you
making a fuss.

1688
01:37:01,556 --> 01:37:02,657
-Colonel?
-Mmm?

1689
01:37:02,724 --> 01:37:03,758
Elvis is here.

1690
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:04,992
Oh...

1691
01:37:05,059 --> 01:37:08,062
Oh. My boy.

1692
01:37:08,128 --> 01:37:10,264
Admiral. How are you?

1693
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:13,601
Oh, my boy, I should have
come down to see you.

1694
01:37:13,668 --> 01:37:16,036
But I'm a little
laid up, you know.

1695
01:37:16,103 --> 01:37:17,237
You've just
had a heart attack.

1696
01:37:17,304 --> 01:37:18,673
You're not meant
to get out of bed.

1697
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:21,308
Heart attack?
Colonel, you said your back--

1698
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:25,379
My heart just stopped is all,
and I fell. It's--

1699
01:37:25,446 --> 01:37:27,481
I put my back out.

1700
01:37:29,617 --> 01:37:31,318
There you go.

1701
01:37:31,385 --> 01:37:34,221
It was all the excitement about
the Christmas special, you see.

1702
01:37:34,288 --> 01:37:35,590
I should never have worried,

1703
01:37:35,657 --> 01:37:39,460
because you came through
like you always do.

1704
01:37:39,527 --> 01:37:44,064
Nobody can sell "show"
to an audience like you.

1705
01:37:44,131 --> 01:37:46,534
I admit it. I was wrong.

1706
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:49,970
Colonel, I--

1707
01:37:50,938 --> 01:37:52,940
I wanted to tell you in person.

1708
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:55,810
Um...

1709
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:59,146
As far as business
is concerned...

1710
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:01,583
I think we need to go
our separate ways.

1711
01:38:06,688 --> 01:38:08,523
Well, you may be right.

1712
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,258
Maybe it is time for me
to retire.

1713
01:38:11,325 --> 01:38:13,494
Oh, come on, Colonel,
quit snowin' me.

1714
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:14,928
You ain't retiring.

1715
01:38:14,995 --> 01:38:19,133
I will miss the circus. I will.

1716
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,636
But I cannot keep up
with these young fellas,

1717
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,203
like your Mr. Hulett,

1718
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:26,140
who wants to put together
a new show

1719
01:38:26,206 --> 01:38:28,909
for an international tour,

1720
01:38:28,976 --> 01:38:31,345
for you to play stadiums.

1721
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:36,718
These international tours
are very, very expensive.

1722
01:38:36,785 --> 01:38:40,387
And the costs
cut into the artist's profits.

1723
01:38:40,454 --> 01:38:42,456
I worry that the financial risk

1724
01:38:42,524 --> 01:38:45,593
would put a strain
on your daddy.

1725
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:47,161
But I cannot help but think,

1726
01:38:47,227 --> 01:38:49,163
as your former
technical advisor

1727
01:38:49,229 --> 01:38:52,332
and as an old friend,
what if...

1728
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:57,371
the next Elvis Presley show
did not cost you a red cent?

1729
01:38:59,908 --> 01:39:05,379
I wonder if your daddy would
not like the sound of that.

1730
01:39:06,581 --> 01:39:10,217
The brand-new
International Hotel.

1731
01:39:29,537 --> 01:39:32,272
It's a mighty big stage.

1732
01:39:32,339 --> 01:39:34,341
The biggest in Las Vegas.

1733
01:39:34,408 --> 01:39:36,511
You could get lost
in a place like this.

1734
01:39:36,578 --> 01:39:39,413
My boy, you performed
that comeback special

1735
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,584
on a tiny square,
inside a studio,

1736
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:44,218
and the fans loved it.

1737
01:39:44,284 --> 01:39:45,720
In a room this size,

1738
01:39:45,787 --> 01:39:50,491
you could give them
the greatest show on earth.

1739
01:39:50,558 --> 01:39:54,294
Nothing less
than Elvis Presley.

1740
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:57,532
I've been experimenting
with a new, big sound.

1741
01:39:57,599 --> 01:39:58,666
Good. Good, my boy.

1742
01:39:58,733 --> 01:40:00,802
Because you can fill up
this entire stage

1743
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,771
with every musical idea
that is inside that head.

1744
01:40:04,939 --> 01:40:06,273
No, it would cost.

1745
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,676
Yes, that's the beauty of it.

1746
01:40:08,743 --> 01:40:10,612
You see, this here
International Hotel--

1747
01:40:16,985 --> 01:40:18,720
This International Hotel...

1748
01:40:18,786 --> 01:40:19,787
Mmm-hmm.

1749
01:40:19,854 --> 01:40:22,456
...needs a major drawing card

1750
01:40:22,524 --> 01:40:26,326
to pull in all the rubes
and put it on the map.

1751
01:40:26,393 --> 01:40:29,196
So they will cover
all of the costs

1752
01:40:29,263 --> 01:40:31,298
of putting together your show.

1753
01:40:31,365 --> 01:40:33,133
And you just play here
for six weeks,

1754
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,068
and then off you go,

1755
01:40:35,135 --> 01:40:37,739
to tour around the world

1756
01:40:37,805 --> 01:40:41,910
with no financial risk
to Elvis Presley Enterprises.

1757
01:40:41,976 --> 01:40:43,377
None.

1758
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:50,217
Well, goddamn.

1759
01:40:56,558 --> 01:40:59,459
- Snowman strikes again.
- Oh, yeah.

1760
01:40:59,527 --> 01:41:03,698
We're going to make it snow.
It will snow.

1761
01:41:03,765 --> 01:41:06,166
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>we're gonna need</i>
<i>the Sweet Inspirations.</i>

1762
01:41:06,233 --> 01:41:08,435
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1763
01:41:08,503 --> 01:41:10,270
<i>And the Imperials.</i>

1764
01:41:10,337 --> 01:41:12,707
<i>We're caught</i>
<i>in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1765
01:41:12,774 --> 01:41:14,976
<i>And a 30-piece orchestra.</i>

1766
01:41:22,316 --> 01:41:25,185
<i>You know,</i>
<i>the first thing</i>
<i>that I ever recorded,</i>

1767
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:26,654
<i>the very first thing,</i>

1768
01:41:26,721 --> 01:41:29,657
<i>was an old, uh, rhythm</i>
<i>and blues-type song</i>

1769
01:41:29,724 --> 01:41:31,859
<i>called "That's All Right,</i>
<i>Little Mama."</i>

1770
01:41:31,926 --> 01:41:34,494
<i>And back then we only had</i>

1771
01:41:34,562 --> 01:41:37,665
<i>two or three instruments</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

1772
01:41:37,732 --> 01:41:39,701
<i>But this ain't</i>
<i>no nostalgia show.</i>

1773
01:41:39,767 --> 01:41:41,903
<i>We're gonna do something</i>
<i>different.</i>

1774
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:50,011
I, uh...
I wanna try something new.

1775
01:41:50,078 --> 01:41:53,982
All right, Glen, you're gonna
start us off, okay?

1776
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:55,449
Take the intro here.

1777
01:42:12,466 --> 01:42:14,167
All right, bring that
bass up, Jerry.

1778
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,774
Keep playing.

1779
01:42:22,076 --> 01:42:23,578
Whoo!

1780
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:26,279
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1781
01:42:26,346 --> 01:42:27,815
<i>-That's all right</i>
<i>-That's all right</i>

1782
01:42:27,882 --> 01:42:29,651
<i>-That's all right</i>
<i>-That's all right</i>

1783
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:30,752
Boys...

1784
01:42:30,818 --> 01:42:31,719
<i>That's all right</i>

1785
01:42:31,786 --> 01:42:32,486
With me.

1786
01:42:32,553 --> 01:42:34,254
<i>Any way you do</i>

1787
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:35,389
All right.

1788
01:42:40,293 --> 01:42:41,763
<i>James, you ready?</i>

1789
01:42:41,829 --> 01:42:43,931
Oh!

1790
01:42:50,638 --> 01:42:51,639
Flames, man!

1791
01:42:51,706 --> 01:42:53,908
Flames are coming
out of that guitar.

1792
01:42:53,975 --> 01:42:56,744
I got that. Ronnie.

1793
01:42:56,811 --> 01:42:57,912
I'll get back to that.

1794
01:42:58,713 --> 01:43:01,381
Horns, you ready?

1795
01:43:01,448 --> 01:43:05,019
<i>Ba-da-bom! Ba-da-bom!</i>

1796
01:43:07,822 --> 01:43:08,790
Let's up the octave!

1797
01:43:10,424 --> 01:43:13,226
Yeah! Goddamn!

1798
01:43:13,293 --> 01:43:16,531
All right, 'bones.
On a one, three, four...

1799
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:26,339
Ronnie,
you know what to do, man.

1800
01:43:26,406 --> 01:43:28,475
Do it to me, come on.
Take us home.

1801
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:33,413
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Hah! Hah! Hah!

1802
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,516
Come on.
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1803
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:37,284
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1804
01:43:53,768 --> 01:43:56,436
- Colonel, nice to see you.
-  -Oh, here you are.

1805
01:43:56,504 --> 01:43:58,338
Yeah. Here you go.

1806
01:44:00,708 --> 01:44:02,176
-How 'bout a hound dog?
-Cool.

1807
01:44:02,242 --> 01:44:03,310
I'll fix you with
some food and drink.

1808
01:44:03,376 --> 01:44:04,478
Thank you.

1809
01:44:07,548 --> 01:44:09,217
All right, let's go.

1810
01:44:44,384 --> 01:44:47,889
<i>Well, that's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

1811
01:44:47,955 --> 01:44:50,758
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>
<i>Just any way you do</i>

1812
01:44:50,825 --> 01:44:52,527
<i>- That's all right</i>
<i>- That's all right</i>

1813
01:44:52,593 --> 01:44:54,228
<i>- That's all right</i>
<i>- That's all right</i>

1814
01:44:54,294 --> 01:45:00,835
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do, yeah</i>

1815
01:45:00,902 --> 01:45:04,972
<i>Well, my mama,</i>
<i>she done told me</i>
<i>Papa told me too</i>

1816
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:07,575
<i>"The life you're livin, son</i>
<i>Now, women be</i>
<i>the death of you"</i>

1817
01:45:07,642 --> 01:45:09,409
<i>Now, that's all right</i>

1818
01:45:09,476 --> 01:45:10,878
<i>That's all right</i>

1819
01:45:10,945 --> 01:45:15,883
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

1820
01:45:25,226 --> 01:45:26,961
<i>That's all right</i>

01:45:27,028 --> 01:45:28,629
<i>That's all right</i>

1822
01:45:28,696 --> 01:45:30,397
<i>That's all right</i>

1823
01:45:30,463 --> 01:45:32,667
<i>Any way you do</i>

1824
01:45:34,235 --> 01:45:37,738
<i>Da, da-da, dee, dee, dee</i>
<i>Dee, dee, dee-dee</i>

1825
01:45:37,805 --> 01:45:40,975
<i>Dee, dee, dee-dee</i>
<i>Dee-dee, dee-dee, dee-dee, do</i>

1826
01:45:41,042 --> 01:45:42,743
<i>- That's all right</i>

1827
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:44,178
<i>- That's all right</i>

1828
01:45:44,245 --> 01:45:50,852

<i>Any way you do</i>

1829
01:45:50,918 --> 01:45:56,456
<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

1830
01:46:08,069 --> 01:46:11,172
Ain't nobody gonna do
a better show than that.

1831
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:12,607
I tell ya, if I was you,

1832
01:46:12,673 --> 01:46:15,009
I would book him
for a hundred years.

1833
01:46:16,344 --> 01:46:19,146
Well, no better time
than the present.

1834
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:22,617
But we hear Hulett has him
doing a world tour.

1835
01:46:24,218 --> 01:46:27,255
Well, well, well, uh,
I think Mr. Presley

1836
01:46:27,321 --> 01:46:31,025
could be persuaded to make
the International his home,

1837
01:46:31,092 --> 01:46:34,729
provided he was paid
pretty well.

1838
01:46:34,795 --> 01:46:36,364
What did you have in mind?

1839
01:46:36,463 --> 01:46:38,766
I'd like to introduce to you
a couple of people tonight,

1840
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:41,569
one of which being
my beautiful wife, Priscilla.

1841
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,872
Would you stand up, honey?

1842
01:46:44,939 --> 01:46:48,643
For an attraction as tremendous
as Mr. Presley...

1843
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:52,280
- We love you,
Priscilla!

1844
01:46:52,346 --> 01:46:55,883
Also, this man over here,
I wouldn't be here without,

1845
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:59,320
my manager of many years,
Colonel Sanders.

1846
01:46:59,387 --> 01:47:02,957
Parker. Parker.

1847
01:47:03,024 --> 01:47:05,326
Well, we're gonna do a new song
for you tonight.

1848
01:47:05,393 --> 01:47:07,528
It's called "Suspicious Minds."

1849
01:47:07,595 --> 01:47:08,996
"Suspicious Minds."

1850
01:47:13,334 --> 01:47:15,202
<i>We're caught in a trap</i>

1851
01:47:16,804 --> 01:47:19,073
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1852
01:47:20,508 --> 01:47:26,113
<i>Because I love you</i>
<i>Too much, baby</i>

1853
01:47:28,316 --> 01:47:29,850
<i>Why can't you see</i>

1854
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:33,988
<i>Oh, what you're doin' to me</i>

1855
01:47:34,055 --> 01:47:40,227
<i>Oh, when you don't believe</i>
<i>A word I'm sayin'?</i>

1856
01:47:42,863 --> 01:47:49,437
<i>We can't go on together</i>
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

1857
01:47:49,503 --> 01:47:52,540
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

1858
01:47:52,606 --> 01:47:56,277
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

1859
01:47:56,344 --> 01:48:00,214
<i>So, if an old friend I know</i>
<i>Shove it up your nose</i>

1860
01:48:00,281 --> 01:48:02,383
<i>Stops by to say hello</i>

1861
01:48:04,051 --> 01:48:11,392
<i>Would I still see suspicion</i>
<i>in your eyes?</i>

1862
01:48:11,459 --> 01:48:14,895
That is what my boy
would expect.

1863
01:48:16,731 --> 01:48:19,467
Now...

1864
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:22,136
What are you going to pay me?

1865
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:31,078
<i>Oh, let our love survive</i>

1866
01:48:31,145 --> 01:48:36,317
Colonel, your sideshow
is the jackpot.

1867
01:48:37,818 --> 01:48:40,388
If you bring him back
every year,

1868
01:48:40,454 --> 01:48:42,823
I'll make it worth your while.

1869
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,526
<i>Oh, I've never...</i>

1870
01:48:47,695 --> 01:48:50,498
<i>Lied to you</i>

1871
01:48:51,499 --> 01:48:53,000
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

1872
01:48:54,568 --> 01:48:57,438
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1873
01:48:57,506 --> 01:48:59,206
<i>...good thing die</i>

1874
01:49:01,876 --> 01:49:05,646
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Now, don't you know</i>

1875
01:49:05,713 --> 01:49:06,947
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

1876
01:49:08,883 --> 01:49:10,818
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1877
01:49:12,086 --> 01:49:15,556
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1878
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:23,931
<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1879
01:49:25,099 --> 01:49:28,135
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1880
01:49:32,006 --> 01:49:36,944
<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1881
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:41,115
<i>Because I love you too much</i>

1882
01:49:44,985 --> 01:49:49,356
<i>Caught in a trap</i>
<i>I can't walk out</i>

1883
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:56,130
<i>Because I love you</i>
<i>Too much, baby</i>

1884
01:49:56,197 --> 01:49:59,366
<i>Oh, don't you know</i>
<i>Caught in a trap</i>

1885
01:50:01,302 --> 01:50:04,772
Of course, I will reserve
the right to sell calendars,

1886
01:50:04,839 --> 01:50:06,207
pictures and such?

1887
01:50:09,176 --> 01:50:11,145
You do whatever
you want, Colonel,

1888
01:50:11,212 --> 01:50:15,316
as long as that boy
stays on that stage.

1889
01:50:29,463 --> 01:50:31,866
<i>My boy's light</i>
<i>burned brighter</i>

1890
01:50:31,932 --> 01:50:34,768
<i>than even 15 years before.</i>

1891
01:50:34,835 --> 01:50:36,203
Hi, darlin'.

1892
01:51:03,898 --> 01:51:06,901
<i>I saw in her face</i>
<i>that night</i>

1893
01:51:06,967 --> 01:51:09,870
<i>what I had always known.</i>

1894
01:51:09,937 --> 01:51:15,676
<i>She could never compete</i>
<i>with the love he felt from you.</i>

1895
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:25,352
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it up there, man.

1896
01:51:26,887 --> 01:51:31,158
<i>Take my... take my hand</i>

1897
01:51:31,225 --> 01:51:36,063
<i>Take my whole...</i>
<i>whole life too</i>

1898
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:38,633
<i>For I... for I...</i>
<i>I can't help</i>

1899
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:40,134
Hey, guys. Time to go back.

1900
01:51:40,201 --> 01:51:44,071
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

1901
01:51:44,138 --> 01:51:49,743
<i>Oh, oh, for I...</i>
<i>For I can't help</i>

1902
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:53,347
<i>Falling in love</i>

1903
01:51:53,414 --> 01:51:58,819
<i>With you</i>

1904
01:52:18,739 --> 01:52:20,407
Thank you very much.

1905
01:52:24,512 --> 01:52:26,514
Thank you! Thank you.

1906
01:52:41,028 --> 01:52:42,930
Such a fine show.

1907
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:50,271
Yeah, baby! Yeah.

1908
01:52:50,337 --> 01:52:52,840
- Wow, great show.
- Thank you. Thank you, all.

1909
01:52:52,906 --> 01:52:55,242
Goddamn, Elvis.
That was great.

1910
01:52:55,309 --> 01:52:56,611
That was fantastic.

1911
01:52:56,678 --> 01:52:57,712
There she is.

1912
01:53:07,522 --> 01:53:10,024
Oh, God. I don't know
who that was out there.

1913
01:53:10,090 --> 01:53:12,259
You were... You...

1914
01:53:12,326 --> 01:53:13,961
You were incredible.
You were...

1915
01:53:14,028 --> 01:53:15,162
You were everything.

1916
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:18,899
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

1917
01:53:20,635 --> 01:53:22,403
Mr. Elvis Presley,

1918
01:53:22,469 --> 01:53:25,406
I guess that's your
new manager over there, hmm?

1919
01:53:25,472 --> 01:53:27,041
-Mmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

1920
01:53:27,107 --> 01:53:29,310
Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to him,
all right?

1921
01:53:29,376 --> 01:53:31,378
-Okay.
-You okay to get upstairs?

1922
01:53:31,445 --> 01:53:32,514
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1923
01:53:47,562 --> 01:53:50,765
Tremendous...
tremendous triumph.

1924
01:53:50,864 --> 01:53:53,501
The greatest show on earth.

1925
01:53:53,568 --> 01:53:58,339
My dear boy, this brainchild
came from you and me,

1926
01:53:58,405 --> 01:54:02,142
but you alone
rose above it all,
and it worked with your talent,

1927
01:54:02,209 --> 01:54:05,714
and your dedication.

1928
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:07,247
We did it. We did it!

1929
01:54:07,314 --> 01:54:09,316
- We did it.
- We did.

1930
01:54:10,819 --> 01:54:13,688
Come on.

1931
01:54:15,456 --> 01:54:18,492
I can't wait to show the world
what you and I can do.

1932
01:54:21,128 --> 01:54:23,397
The world will see this show.

1933
01:54:23,464 --> 01:54:25,700
Whatever it takes,
I guarantee it.

1934
01:54:25,767 --> 01:54:27,234
Whatever I have to do.

1935
01:54:31,138 --> 01:54:32,439
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i>of the press,</i>

1936
01:54:32,507 --> 01:54:35,543
the King of Rock and Roll,
Elvis Presley!

1937
01:54:37,211 --> 01:54:38,680
No, I'm not the king.

1938
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:41,516
Hey, Fats. Mr. Fats Domino,
ladies and gentlemen.

1939
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,618
This is the real king
of rock and roll.

1940
01:54:43,685 --> 01:54:45,085
Yeah, I'm somethin' else.

1941
01:54:45,152 --> 01:54:47,187
Any plans
to take this show on tour?

1942
01:54:47,254 --> 01:54:49,323
There's so many places
I haven't been yet, you know.

1943
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:53,293
I'd like to go to Europe.
I'd like to go to Japan.

1944
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,496
I've never been
out of the country,

1945
01:54:55,563 --> 01:54:56,897
<i>except in the service.</i>

1946
01:55:03,003 --> 01:55:04,639
What are you lookin' at
back there?

1947
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:06,407
Oh, Mr. Diskin.

1948
01:55:06,473 --> 01:55:08,142
Have we discussed
with Mr. Hulett,

1949
01:55:08,208 --> 01:55:09,943
pertaining
to the death threats?

1950
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:11,979
The death threats?

1951
01:55:12,045 --> 01:55:14,783
Precisely. Death threats!

1952
01:55:16,316 --> 01:55:18,385
<i>Down in Louisiana</i>

1953
01:55:18,452 --> 01:55:22,356
<i>Where the alligators</i>
<i>Grow so mean</i>

1954
01:55:22,423 --> 01:55:25,660
<i>Lived a girl that I swear</i>
<i>To the world</i>

1955
01:55:25,727 --> 01:55:28,095
<i>Made the alligators</i>
<i>look tame</i>

1956
01:55:28,162 --> 01:55:29,062
<i>Polk salad Annie</i>

1957
01:55:32,099 --> 01:55:33,568
<i>Colonel,</i>
<i>once we finish the season,</i>

1958
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:35,570
<i>Elvis wants</i>
<i>to take the tour overseas.</i>

1959
01:55:35,637 --> 01:55:38,972
Overseas? Have you thought
about security, Jerry?

1960
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:41,008
<i>Of course I have.</i>

1961
01:55:41,074 --> 01:55:43,043
<i>This is Elvis Presley,</i>

1962
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:46,180
<i>the most famous man</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

1963
01:55:46,246 --> 01:55:48,850
<i>Straight-razor totin' woman</i>

1964
01:55:48,917 --> 01:55:50,384
<i>Lord, have mercy</i>

1965
01:55:50,451 --> 01:55:51,952
<i>The crazies</i>
<i>in those countries...</i>

1966
01:55:52,019 --> 01:55:54,221
They're a hundred times
more dangerous.

1967
01:55:54,288 --> 01:55:57,090
Am I the only one
who thinks about security?

1968
01:55:57,157 --> 01:56:00,127
<i>Sock a little polk salad</i>

1969
01:56:00,194 --> 01:56:01,663
<i>You know I need it</i>

1970
01:56:03,297 --> 01:56:06,568
There is nothing more important
than security!

1971
01:56:20,414 --> 01:56:24,719
Am I the only one who ever
thinks about Elvis' security!

1972
01:56:31,593 --> 01:56:32,760
Get him out of here!

1973
01:56:39,266 --> 01:56:41,034
<i>Those guys</i>
<i>turned out to be</i>

1974
01:56:41,101 --> 01:56:43,370
<i>some over-excited fans</i>
<i>from Peru.</i>

1975
01:56:43,437 --> 01:56:46,006
<i>But the death threats</i>
<i>were real.</i>

1976
01:56:46,073 --> 01:56:48,442
I'm going back on.

1977
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:50,678
I'll rip his goddamn tongue out
by the roots.

1978
01:56:50,745 --> 01:56:54,582
<i>It started</i>
<i>to take its toll.</i>

1979
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:57,685
Here at Baptist Memorial
Hospital in Midtown Memphis,

1980
01:56:57,752 --> 01:57:00,989
Elvis Presley has apparently
checked in to a private suite,

1981
01:57:01,054 --> 01:57:02,857
suffering from exhaustion.

1982
01:57:02,924 --> 01:57:04,859
A sign that Elvis
is in fact here

1983
01:57:04,926 --> 01:57:08,863
is the aluminum foil
that covers his windows
to deflect the sun.

1984
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:10,598
<i>Shock around the nation today</i>

1985
01:57:10,665 --> 01:57:13,066
<i>as a free rock concert</i>
<i>at the Altamont Speedway</i>

1986
01:57:13,133 --> 01:57:15,637
<i>by English band</i>
<i>The Rolling Stones,</i>

1987
01:57:15,703 --> 01:57:17,371
<i>ended with four deaths.</i>

1988
01:57:17,437 --> 01:57:20,008
<i>One resulting from a stabbing,</i>
<i>allegedly committed...</i>

1989
01:57:20,073 --> 01:57:22,376
Elvis,
Dr. Nick is here.

1990
01:57:24,177 --> 01:57:26,146
Such a lovely girl,
Ms. Tate.

1991
01:57:26,213 --> 01:57:28,883
What has happened to law
and order in this country?

1992
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:30,585
Hippies and radicals,

1993
01:57:30,652 --> 01:57:33,922
threatening and killing
popular entertainers.

1994
01:57:33,988 --> 01:57:38,358
The IRA blowing up England?
Planes exploding in mid-air?

1995
01:57:38,425 --> 01:57:39,761
Has the world gone mad?

1996
01:57:39,827 --> 01:57:42,864
Hulett's security
is not what it needs to be.

1997
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:44,331
And he knows it.

1998
01:57:44,398 --> 01:57:46,568
An international tour now
is out of the question.

1999
01:57:46,634 --> 01:57:48,503
What are you talking about,
Colonel?

2000
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:50,705
I ain't gonna let these sons of
bitches push me off the stage.

2001
01:57:50,772 --> 01:57:52,205
Precisely.

2002
01:57:52,272 --> 01:57:54,008
You are not one of Hulett's
long-hair Zeppelins,

2003
01:57:54,074 --> 01:57:56,076
you are Elvis Presley.

2004
01:57:56,143 --> 01:57:57,812
You are beloved.

2005
01:57:57,879 --> 01:58:00,715
And I told him I have to
look Priscilla in the eye,

2006
01:58:00,782 --> 01:58:05,620
and I have to promise her
that little Lisa Marie's daddy

2007
01:58:05,687 --> 01:58:08,723
will be safe while
he's away from home.

2008
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:10,558
We're taking the show
to the world, Colonel.

2009
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:13,160
I ain't gonna disappoint
those fans.

2010
01:58:17,264 --> 01:58:19,199
Well...

2011
01:58:19,266 --> 01:58:24,338
If you want to book more dates,
we could do an American tour,

2012
01:58:24,404 --> 01:58:26,674
15 cities in 15 days,

2013
01:58:26,741 --> 01:58:30,310
while Mr. Hulett
straightens out his security
problems overseas.

2014
01:58:30,377 --> 01:58:32,479
I'd like that
very much, son.

2015
01:58:32,547 --> 01:58:34,114
How is that gonna be any safer?

2016
01:58:34,181 --> 01:58:36,283
Because staying
in this country,

2017
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:40,187
I can handle every aspect
of security.

2018
01:58:40,253 --> 01:58:41,689
And then we go international?

2019
01:58:41,756 --> 01:58:44,726
Yeah, sure, around the world.
Wherever you want.

2020
01:58:44,792 --> 01:58:46,293
But in the meantime,
here in America,

2021
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:48,997
we put on a great show.

2022
01:58:49,063 --> 01:58:50,330
And what will we do, Charlie?

2023
01:58:50,397 --> 01:58:52,332
And have a lot of fun.

2024
01:58:53,067 --> 01:58:55,637
Taking care of business.

2025
01:58:57,237 --> 01:58:59,641
Taking care of business.

2026
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:09,584
<i>I'll get guarantees</i>
<i>from every mayor.</i>

2027
01:59:09,651 --> 01:59:11,753
<i>We'll double</i>
<i>the police presence.</i>

2028
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:14,789
<i>You'll have more security</i>
<i>than the President.</i>

2029
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:21,629
<i>Lord Almighty</i>
<i>I feel my temperature rising</i>

2030
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:27,568
<i>Higher, higher</i>
<i>It's burning through</i>
<i>to my soul</i>

2031
01:59:29,504 --> 01:59:35,109
<i>Girl, girl, girl</i>
<i>You're gonna set me on fire</i>

2032
01:59:35,175 --> 01:59:38,178
<i>My brain is flaming</i>
<i>I don't know which way to go</i>

2033
01:59:38,245 --> 01:59:39,714
<i>And when</i>
<i>the show is done,</i>

2034
01:59:39,781 --> 01:59:42,917
<i>the boys will hustle you</i>
<i>to the motorcade.</i>

2035
01:59:42,984 --> 01:59:45,019
Elvis has left the building.

2036
01:59:45,086 --> 01:59:49,256
<i>Once you're in the air,</i>
<i>Dr. Nick will ensure your rest.</i>

2037
01:59:50,058 --> 01:59:51,726
<i>Burnin' love</i>

2038
01:59:51,793 --> 01:59:54,327
<i>Land in the next city,</i>
<i>then we do it all again.</i>

2039
01:59:54,394 --> 01:59:55,730
<i>Fifteen times!</i>

2040
01:59:55,797 --> 01:59:58,700
<i>I'm just a hunk</i>
<i>A hunk of burning love</i>

2041
01:59:58,766 --> 02:00:00,768
<i>I'm just a hunk</i>
<i>A hunk of burning love</i>

2042
02:00:00,835 --> 02:00:03,538
<i>It was life</i>
<i>on the road,</i>
<i>just like the old days.</i>

2043
02:00:03,604 --> 02:00:07,842
<i>We were making so much snow,</i>
<i>we did it again.</i>

2044
02:00:10,011 --> 02:00:11,546
<i>And again.</i>

2045
02:00:12,245 --> 02:00:14,247
<i>And again.</i>

2046
02:00:14,314 --> 02:00:17,685
<i>All in the safety</i>
<i>of the US of A.</i>

2047
02:00:21,089 --> 02:00:24,759
<i>Eventually, he lost interest</i>
<i>in going overseas.</i>

2048
02:00:24,826 --> 02:00:26,326
<i>Why would you?</i>

2049
02:00:26,393 --> 02:00:30,932
<i>But I still kept my promise.</i>
<i>I brought the world to him.</i>

2050
02:00:30,998 --> 02:00:35,203
<i>I invented the world's</i>
<i>first ever satellite concert.</i>

2051
02:00:38,039 --> 02:00:43,443
<i>1.5 billion people in</i>
<i>one night, for a single artist.</i>

2052
02:00:43,511 --> 02:00:46,881
<i>Nothing like it before,</i>
<i>nothing like it since.</i>

2053
02:00:56,456 --> 02:00:58,960
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

2054
02:00:59,026 --> 02:01:04,966
<i>He was addicted to the love</i>
<i>he felt from you onstage.</i>

2055
02:01:05,032 --> 02:01:08,669
<i>Ordinary love</i>
<i>just didn't compare.</i>

2056
02:01:09,871 --> 02:01:14,642
<i>So, in the lonely moments</i>
<i>between shows,</i>

2057
02:01:14,709 --> 02:01:18,012
<i>he turned to them pills.</i>

2058
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:20,515
Priscilla, I want you to
do something for me, will you?

2059
02:01:20,581 --> 02:01:24,317
You give my baby girl
a big hug for me, okay?

2060
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,122
<i>The roar of the crowd.</i>

2061
02:01:28,189 --> 02:01:30,091
<i>The life on the road.</i>

2062
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:33,561
<i>Calling home</i>
<i>to your loved ones,</i>
<i>pretending nothing has changed,</i>

2063
02:01:33,628 --> 02:01:35,563
<i>when everything has.</i>

2064
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:37,765
<i>Lost.</i>

2065
02:01:38,533 --> 02:01:40,001
What was that?

2066
02:01:43,704 --> 02:01:45,873
Ain't no one
gonna walk around

2067
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,474
sayin' they killed
Elvis Presley.

2068
02:01:47,542 --> 02:01:49,677
-What did you say?
-Nothing, baby.

2069
02:01:52,814 --> 02:01:55,650
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King</i>
<i>has been shot</i>

2070
02:01:55,716 --> 02:01:57,151
<i>in downtown Memphis,</i>
<i>Tennessee...</i>

2071
02:02:00,288 --> 02:02:02,389
<i>Sharon Tate was the last</i>
<i>to die.</i>

2072
02:02:11,566 --> 02:02:13,433
Is that you, doll?

2073
02:02:13,501 --> 02:02:17,004
I'm leaving you,
and I'm taking Lisa with me.

2074
02:02:17,071 --> 02:02:20,107
Uh, 'Cilla, is this about
what happens on the road?

2075
02:02:20,174 --> 02:02:21,441
About the what?

2076
02:02:21,509 --> 02:02:22,977
Is this about what happens
on the road?

2077
02:02:23,044 --> 02:02:24,545
The girls? You think
I give a shit about the girls

2078
02:02:24,612 --> 02:02:25,913
that you sneak in
through the side door?

2079
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:27,915
No. I couldn't care less
about whoever it is

2080
02:02:27,982 --> 02:02:29,617
you sneak through
the side door.

2081
02:02:29,684 --> 02:02:31,118
It's about this, Elvis.

2082
02:02:31,185 --> 02:02:32,620
-And this.
-Hey. Whoa.

2083
02:02:32,687 --> 02:02:34,722
And these goddamn pills
those leeches

2084
02:02:34,789 --> 02:02:36,290
and has-beens feed
down your throat!

2085
02:02:36,356 --> 02:02:37,525
God damn it.

2086
02:02:37,592 --> 02:02:38,793
-Like you're strung out.
-Strung out?

2087
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:40,360
Goddamn, I'm in the best
shape of my life.

2088
02:02:40,427 --> 02:02:41,996
Best shape of your life.

2089
02:02:42,063 --> 02:02:43,496
The only time you're happy
is when you're on that stage.

2090
02:02:43,564 --> 02:02:44,966
And in between that,
you're a ghost.

2091
02:02:45,032 --> 02:02:47,068
'Cilla, I give you everything
you could want.

2092
02:02:47,134 --> 02:02:48,736
What I want is a husband.

2093
02:02:48,803 --> 02:02:51,539
I am your wife.
I am your wife!

2094
02:02:51,606 --> 02:02:55,009
And Lisa is your daughter.
She needs a father.

2095
02:02:55,076 --> 02:02:57,044
I am her father!

2096
02:03:03,551 --> 02:03:04,719
Do you remember the last time

2097
02:03:04,785 --> 02:03:06,621
that we laughed together?

2098
02:03:06,687 --> 02:03:08,522
Do you remember the last time
that the three of us

2099
02:03:08,589 --> 02:03:10,423
sat down and had
dinner together?

2100
02:03:11,759 --> 02:03:15,495
You won't even make love
to me anymore.

2101
02:03:15,563 --> 02:03:19,967
I gift you my life, and I have
nothing left in me to give you.

2102
02:03:24,505 --> 02:03:26,107
Do you still love me?

2103
02:03:45,726 --> 02:03:50,164
When you're 40 and I'm 50,
we'll be back together.

2104
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,935
You'll see.

2105
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:12,485
I have to go.

2106
02:04:12,553 --> 02:04:14,021
Will you please stay?

2107
02:04:14,088 --> 02:04:17,925
I have to go. Okay?
If I stay, I'll never leave.

2108
02:04:17,992 --> 02:04:19,560
-Please...
-You have to let me go.

2109
02:04:19,627 --> 02:04:21,662
-Please, Priscilla.
-You have to let me go.

2110
02:04:44,085 --> 02:04:45,853
<i>Fifty thousand</i>
<i>people gathered</i>

2111
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,855
<i>in New Orleans earlier today</i>
<i>to mourn the passing</i>

2112
02:04:47,922 --> 02:04:50,591
<i>of gospel legend,</i>
<i>Mahalia Jackson.</i>

2113
02:04:50,658 --> 02:04:51,826
<i>Will you</i>
<i>come to Mississippi</i>

2114
02:04:51,892 --> 02:04:53,694
<i>and sing with us, Mr. Presley?</i>

2115
02:04:53,761 --> 02:04:58,065
Why, B.B. King will be there.
Perhaps even
the Rolling Stones.

2116
02:04:58,132 --> 02:05:00,067
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson.</i>

2117
02:05:00,134 --> 02:05:03,537
<i>The Colonel, he...</i>
<i>he won't allow it.</i>

2118
02:05:03,604 --> 02:05:06,007
<i>You are a man,</i>
<i>Mr. Presley.</i>

2119
02:05:06,073 --> 02:05:07,608
And a man don't
make up his own mind

2120
02:05:07,675 --> 02:05:10,044
about matters of conscience.

2121
02:05:10,111 --> 02:05:12,413
<i>Come on, Diskin.</i>
<i>Elvis needs a challenge</i>

2122
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,814
<i>to get back on track.</i>

2123
02:05:13,881 --> 02:05:16,250
Why won't the Colonel
let him go overseas?

2124
02:05:16,317 --> 02:05:18,185
-Security, Jerry.
You know that.
-Bullshit!

2125
02:05:18,252 --> 02:05:20,588
The Colonel's killing
his greatest asset
without a reason.

2126
02:05:20,654 --> 02:05:22,490
So what is the reason?

2127
02:05:22,556 --> 02:05:25,059
Colonel always has his reasons.

2128
02:05:25,126 --> 02:05:27,061
<i>I'm not at liberty to divulge</i>

2129
02:05:27,128 --> 02:05:28,929
<i>personal information</i>
<i>about Mr. Parker.</i>

2130
02:05:28,996 --> 02:05:31,032
<i>He lied.</i>

2131
02:05:31,098 --> 02:05:32,633
There wasn't gonna be
an international tour

2132
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,001
'cause he can't leave
the country.

2133
02:05:34,068 --> 02:05:36,404
He's got no citizenship,
no official identity.

2134
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:37,738
He doesn't exist.

2135
02:05:37,805 --> 02:05:40,975
There never was
a Colonel Tom Parker.

2136
02:05:41,042 --> 02:05:43,044
What are you
talking about, Jerry?

2137
02:05:44,178 --> 02:05:45,613
Hey, whoa, whoa!

2138
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:46,680
Get him
an ice bucket!

2139
02:05:51,318 --> 02:05:52,620
Colonel's a smart man.

2140
02:05:52,686 --> 02:05:54,188
There's got to be
another reason.

2141
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:55,456
Come on, man!

2142
02:05:55,524 --> 02:05:56,891
I will
stay here at home,

2143
02:05:56,957 --> 02:05:59,060
and I will work
and I will worry.

2144
02:05:59,126 --> 02:06:01,629
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>why the Colonel</i>
<i>kept turning them down,</i>

2145
02:06:01,695 --> 02:06:02,797
I have no idea, man.

2146
02:06:04,398 --> 02:06:05,933
Get out of the way!

2147
02:06:07,568 --> 02:06:11,639
Now, you listen to me.
The only thing that matters...

2148
02:06:11,705 --> 02:06:14,775
is that that man
gets up on that stage tonight.

2149
02:06:16,277 --> 02:06:19,613
If he was my son,
I'd put him in a hospital.

2150
02:06:23,617 --> 02:06:27,121
Well, of course, this is
a Presley Enterprises decision.

2151
02:06:28,055 --> 02:06:29,323
Vernon?

2152
02:06:30,658 --> 02:06:33,294
Well... um...

2153
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,565
Well, what can you...

2154
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:38,999
What can you do for him,
Dr. Nick?

2155
02:06:41,035 --> 02:06:48,075
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

2156
02:06:53,047 --> 02:06:58,953
<i>His truth is marching on</i>

2157
02:07:13,334 --> 02:07:15,269
Thank you. Thank you.

2158
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:17,572
Now he's gonna ask the house
lights to be brought up,

2159
02:07:17,638 --> 02:07:18,973
'cause we've been
looking at him.

2160
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:20,941
He wants to look at us now.
He loves this.

2161
02:07:21,008 --> 02:07:22,544
I'd like to turn
the house lights up,

2162
02:07:22,611 --> 02:07:24,311
-ladies and gentlemen.
-Eh?

2163
02:07:24,378 --> 02:07:27,448
'Cause now that you've seen me,
I'd like to take a look at you.

2164
02:07:30,017 --> 02:07:32,219
Oh, you're beautiful.
Thank you.

2165
02:07:32,286 --> 02:07:34,021
He'll mention the VIPs
that are here.

2166
02:07:34,088 --> 02:07:36,390
We've got some high-rollers
in here tonight.

2167
02:07:36,457 --> 02:07:37,725
Get ready for the spotlight.

2168
02:07:37,791 --> 02:07:41,128
Mr. International Hotel
himself.

2169
02:07:41,195 --> 02:07:43,632
-Thank you.
-Ah, there you go.

2170
02:07:43,697 --> 02:07:46,133
And right next to him,

2171
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:51,038
is my so-called manager,
Colonel Tom Parker.

2172
02:07:51,105 --> 02:07:54,708
- There he is.
- Come on.

2173
02:07:54,775 --> 02:08:00,181
But I hear rumors
that Colonel is an alien.

2174
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:04,586
Got here on my rocket ship.

2175
02:08:07,221 --> 02:08:08,255
Oh.

2176
02:08:11,959 --> 02:08:14,061
Somebody call the FBI

2177
02:08:14,128 --> 02:08:16,730
and tell 'em that
he has abducted me,

2178
02:08:16,797 --> 02:08:21,101
that he has locked me
in this golden cage,

2179
02:08:21,168 --> 02:08:25,406
to keep me here forever
with you, ladies and gentlemen.

2180
02:08:28,342 --> 02:08:31,278
<i>So I'm caught in a trap</i>

2181
02:08:31,345 --> 02:08:33,981
<i>I can't get out</i>

2182
02:08:35,182 --> 02:08:39,019
'Cause Colonel's got some
big debts, baby.

2183
02:08:42,856 --> 02:08:44,992
Excuse me.

2184
02:08:45,059 --> 02:08:48,597
Well, this is the last show
I'm ever playing here.

2185
02:08:50,097 --> 02:08:55,236
I'm gonna get on my jet plane,
the Lisa Marie...

2186
02:08:55,302 --> 02:08:59,907
It's named after my, uh...
my beautiful daughter.

2187
02:08:59,974 --> 02:09:02,176
And I'm gonna fly away.

2188
02:09:03,811 --> 02:09:05,913
No, no, no...

2189
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:08,949
You know, I'm gonna fly away.

2190
02:09:09,016 --> 02:09:10,985
Stop the show.
Stop this show!

2191
02:09:11,051 --> 02:09:12,386
Come on,
get this curtain down.

2192
02:09:12,453 --> 02:09:14,221
Fuck the International.

2193
02:09:14,288 --> 02:09:17,726
Mr. Schilling, what the devil
is happening here?

2194
02:09:17,791 --> 02:09:19,159
And Las Vegas.

2195
02:09:19,226 --> 02:09:20,394
That's what
he wants to know.

2196
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:23,163
Ain't no one
gonna stop me, man.

2197
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:27,535
Oh! Security.

2198
02:09:27,602 --> 02:09:29,169
Security!

2199
02:09:30,605 --> 02:09:34,341
Security, security! Security!

2200
02:09:34,408 --> 02:09:36,377
800 shows!

2201
02:09:36,443 --> 02:09:39,547
You don't have
a goddamn passport,
you son of a bitch!

2202
02:09:40,347 --> 02:09:42,049
You are fired!

2203
02:09:42,684 --> 02:09:44,885
You are fired!

2204
02:09:45,587 --> 02:09:48,088
You're fired!

2205
02:09:57,766 --> 02:09:59,400
You're fired.

2206
02:10:05,372 --> 02:10:06,940
E., I--

2207
02:10:08,909 --> 02:10:11,445
Colonel, I gotta--
I'll talk him down.

2208
02:10:19,654 --> 02:10:21,989
This is Colonel Tom Parker.
I wish it to be known

2209
02:10:22,056 --> 02:10:25,426
that Dr. Nick's services
are no longer required.

2210
02:10:25,492 --> 02:10:26,960
Thank you.

2211
02:10:28,295 --> 02:10:29,798
Hmm.

2212
02:10:29,863 --> 02:10:31,533
Well, Diskin...

2213
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:34,168
if the boy wants to set out
on his own,

2214
02:10:34,234 --> 02:10:37,237
it's all right by me,
but Presley Enterprises

2215
02:10:37,304 --> 02:10:39,808
is going to cough up
what it owes.

2216
02:10:39,873 --> 02:10:41,875
-Are you ready?
-Ready.

2217
02:10:41,942 --> 02:10:44,512
Gasoline for the first trip
to the Hayride...

2218
02:10:44,579 --> 02:10:46,213
one dollar and 25 cents.

2219
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,215
Un-recouped promotional costs

2220
02:10:48,282 --> 02:10:51,118

calendars, $100.

2221

Collectible trading cards,
$100.

<i>Balloons, $50...</i>

2224
02:11:12,807 --> 02:11:14,007
What's the hold-up?

2225
02:11:14,074 --> 02:11:17,111
Sorry, E.P. Your daddy
won't come down.

2226
02:11:21,816 --> 02:11:23,016
Daddy.

2227
02:11:41,001 --> 02:11:43,003
What is this?

2228
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:47,007
Well, that is what we owe
the Colonel.

2229
02:11:49,711 --> 02:11:51,412
We're broke.

2230
02:11:53,947 --> 02:11:56,984
Daddy, I've been playing this
mausoleum for a hundred years.

2231
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:58,485
How could we be broke?

2232
02:11:58,553 --> 02:12:00,320
You spend
so much money.

2233
02:12:00,387 --> 02:12:04,057
You know, you got the cars
and the girls and the clothes,

2234
02:12:04,124 --> 02:12:06,193
and all the...
you know, new airplane.

2235
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:07,662
Daddy, you are
my business manager.

2236
02:12:07,729 --> 02:12:09,296
You're supposed
to be taking care of business.

2237
02:12:09,363 --> 02:12:12,132
I don't know what to tell you,
son, we're broke!

2238
02:12:12,199 --> 02:12:13,934
We're plain broke.

2239
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:15,936
Gotta take the Colonel back.

2240
02:12:16,003 --> 02:12:18,172
I am not taking him back.

2241
02:12:18,238 --> 02:12:20,140
We're gonna lose Graceland.

2242
02:12:32,587 --> 02:12:34,522
I am not taking him back!

2243
02:12:37,424 --> 02:12:38,693
He takes everything from me.

2244
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:41,228
He takes 50%
of everything that I make!

2245
02:12:41,295 --> 02:12:42,730
And now he wants
to take the home

2246
02:12:42,797 --> 02:12:44,398
that we bought for Mama!

2247
02:12:45,567 --> 02:12:46,568
Listen to me, Daddy.

2248
02:12:46,634 --> 02:12:49,737
That old bastard
can sue if he wants,

2249
02:12:49,804 --> 02:12:51,673
but I am flying away.

2250
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:54,374
With or without you.

2251
02:13:04,184 --> 02:13:07,522
Oh, you bloodsucking,
old vampire.

2252
02:13:07,589 --> 02:13:11,024
You bled me dry
and you still want more?

2253
02:13:11,091 --> 02:13:13,327
I'm not an uncaring man,
Mr. Presley.

2254
02:13:13,393 --> 02:13:16,430
Don't you "Mr. Presley" me,
you toad.

2255
02:13:16,497 --> 02:13:19,567
If you are so determined
to get out of our contract--

2256
02:13:19,634 --> 02:13:21,168
You're goddamn right
I want out.

2257
02:13:21,235 --> 02:13:23,136
Well, I will personally
loan you the money

2258
02:13:23,203 --> 02:13:25,172
that you owe
to Jamboree Attractions.

2259
02:13:25,239 --> 02:13:27,007
Yeah, you'll still have
your claws in me.

2260
02:13:27,074 --> 02:13:28,308
You'll still have me
working here

2261
02:13:28,375 --> 02:13:30,277
like a goddamn slave
in a salt mine,

2262
02:13:30,344 --> 02:13:32,647
you phony, no-good
piece of trash!

2263
02:13:32,714 --> 02:13:36,584
I oughta shoot you in your fat,
goddamn face!

2264
02:13:37,685 --> 02:13:38,920
Who are you?

2265
02:13:38,987 --> 02:13:41,088
I am you. And you are me.

2266
02:13:41,154 --> 02:13:42,590
Cut the horseshit!

2267
02:13:42,657 --> 02:13:44,926
Everything I've ever known
about you has been a lie.

2268
02:13:44,993 --> 02:13:46,528
E.P., you all good?

2269
02:13:46,594 --> 02:13:50,999
My past is the least
of your problems, my boy.

2270
02:13:51,064 --> 02:13:56,838
Everyone else
you associate with
lives from you, Mr. Presley.

2271
02:13:56,905 --> 02:13:58,673
Even Vernon.

2272
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:01,776
That's right,
even your own daddy

2273
02:14:01,843 --> 02:14:05,479
has looked after himself
before he's looked after you.

2274
02:14:05,547 --> 02:14:08,716
Yes, I have lived
from you, too,
but the difference is

2275
02:14:08,783 --> 02:14:10,450
you have also lived from me.

2276
02:14:10,518 --> 02:14:15,322
We have supported each other.
Because we shared a dream.

2277
02:14:15,389 --> 02:14:18,660
We are the same, you and I.

2278
02:14:18,726 --> 02:14:24,498
We are two odd,
lonely children,
reaching for eternity.

2279
02:14:27,035 --> 02:14:29,871
Maybe you should fly away,
my boy.

2280
02:14:29,938 --> 02:14:33,641
Away from all of this.

2281
02:14:33,708 --> 02:14:37,812
But if you do choose
to leave...

2282
02:14:39,379 --> 02:14:42,917
then I, for one,
will be very lonely.

2283
02:14:42,984 --> 02:14:45,485
So would your father.

2284
02:14:45,553 --> 02:14:49,323
But I think you may
be lonely, too.

2285
02:14:52,192 --> 02:14:55,262
Oh, you see, my boy, the...

2286
02:14:55,329 --> 02:14:58,833
truth about
the Rock of Eternity...

2287
02:15:01,869 --> 02:15:07,240
It is forever
just beyond our reach.

2288
02:15:35,103 --> 02:15:40,273
<i>Do the chairs</i>
<i>in your parlor</i>

2289
02:15:41,843 --> 02:15:45,613
<i>Seem empty and bare?</i>

2290
02:15:47,649 --> 02:15:52,319
<i>Do you gaze</i>
<i>at your doorstep</i>

2291
02:15:53,955 --> 02:15:57,525
<i>Picture me there?</i>

2292
02:15:59,594 --> 02:16:04,331
<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain?</i>

2293
02:16:05,399 --> 02:16:09,804
<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

2294
02:16:11,471 --> 02:16:14,307
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

2295
02:16:14,374 --> 02:16:19,714
<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

2296
02:16:21,516 --> 02:16:26,253
<i>Is your heart</i>
<i>filled with pain?</i>

2297
02:16:27,287 --> 02:16:31,726
<i>Shall I come back again?</i>

2298
02:16:33,493 --> 02:16:36,130
<i>Tell me, dear</i>

2299
02:16:36,196 --> 02:16:42,369
<i>Are you lonesome tonight?</i>

2300
02:16:50,144 --> 02:16:53,413
Son, I know...
I know, I...

2301
02:16:55,983 --> 02:16:57,985
I wanna try and...

2302
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:02,990
I wanna try and fix this.
You know...

2303
02:17:07,028 --> 02:17:08,395
Daddy...

2304
02:17:13,668 --> 02:17:15,870
Tell that son of a bitch...

2305
02:17:15,937 --> 02:17:18,639
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

2306
02:17:27,048 --> 02:17:28,248
And, Daddy...

2307
02:17:30,618 --> 02:17:35,022
Tell the Colonel
to send up Dr. Nick.

2308
02:17:53,007 --> 02:17:54,809
<i>It's a beautiful day</i>

Oh, look, here they come.

2326
02:18:35,883 --> 02:18:37,484
- Are you all right?
- Yep.

2327
02:18:37,552 --> 02:18:39,287
All right, Daddy loves you.

2328
02:18:39,352 --> 02:18:41,689
- Bye, baby.
- Come on, baby.

2329
02:18:41,756 --> 02:18:43,057
-Bye, Papa.
-Good girl.

2330
02:18:43,124 --> 02:18:45,560
- Bye, baby.
- Give me your hand.

2331
02:18:46,694 --> 02:18:47,862
Hi!

2332
02:18:47,929 --> 02:18:50,832
- Here she is.
- Hi, baby. How you doing?

2333
02:18:53,534 --> 02:18:54,969
Want to say goodbye to Daddy?

2334
02:18:55,036 --> 02:18:58,438
- Bye, Daddy.
- You're so good.

2335
02:18:59,807 --> 02:19:02,409
Hi. How are you?
How you doing?

2336
02:19:02,475 --> 02:19:03,978
We're okay.

2337
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:24,632
Hey.

2338
02:19:25,867 --> 02:19:27,001
Hi.

2339
02:19:29,469 --> 02:19:30,838
Hmm.

2340
02:19:36,277 --> 02:19:37,912
How are you doing?

2341
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:56,230
Honey, there's this place
in San Diego

2342
02:19:56,297 --> 02:19:57,999
that you can go to rest.

2343
02:19:59,033 --> 02:20:00,433
To heal.

2344
02:20:00,501 --> 02:20:02,603
After the show, you can fly
directly and be in a clinic

2345
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:03,738
before anyone knows.

2346
02:20:03,804 --> 02:20:05,172
It's all been arranged.

2347
02:20:07,508 --> 02:20:09,911
I'm gonna be 40 soon, 'Cilla.

2348
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:14,782
Forty.

2349
02:20:14,849 --> 02:20:17,518
And nobody's gonna remember me.

2350
02:20:19,754 --> 02:20:21,956
I never did anything lasting.

2351
02:20:24,158 --> 02:20:27,427
I never made that classic film
that I could be proud of.

2352
02:20:27,494 --> 02:20:29,797
But what about <i>A Star is Born?</i>

2353
02:20:31,599 --> 02:20:34,035
Uh...

2354
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:39,173
Barbra... the Colonel...

2355
02:20:45,646 --> 02:20:48,883
Please go.

2356
02:20:48,950 --> 02:20:50,918
For Lisa?

2357
02:20:50,985 --> 02:20:53,721
If you dream it,
you can do it, baby.

2358
02:20:55,690 --> 02:20:57,658
I'm all out of dreams.

2359
02:21:00,127 --> 02:21:01,862
Promise me.

2360
02:21:35,696 --> 02:21:39,633
I... will always... love you.

2361
02:21:57,585 --> 02:22:00,654
Hi, baby.

2362
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:48,335
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>there's a kind of bird</i>

2363
02:22:48,402 --> 02:22:50,604
<i>that doesn't have any legs?</i>

2364
02:22:50,671 --> 02:22:52,807
<i>So it can't land on nothing.</i>

2365
02:22:54,842 --> 02:22:57,144
<i>It lives its whole life</i>
<i>on the wing.</i>

2366
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:03,451
When it gets tired,
it just spreads its wings

2367
02:23:03,518 --> 02:23:06,020
and sleeps on the wind.

2368
02:23:08,557 --> 02:23:12,259
<i>If it ever does land,</i>
<i>even but one time...</i>

2369
02:23:14,829 --> 02:23:16,730
<i>so it dies.</i>

2370
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:21,302
<i>Good evening.</i>

2371
02:23:21,368 --> 02:23:24,672
<i>Elvis Presley died today.</i>
<i>He was 42.</i>

2372
02:23:24,738 --> 02:23:26,407
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>it was a heart attack.</i>

2373
02:23:26,474 --> 02:23:28,409
<i>He was found in his home</i>
<i>in Memphis...</i>

2374
02:23:28,476 --> 02:23:30,778
<i>President Carter</i>
<i>has just made a statement...</i>

2375
02:23:30,845 --> 02:23:32,279
<i>Elvis Presley's death</i>

2376
02:23:32,346 --> 02:23:34,815
<i>deprives our country</i>
<i>of a part of itself.</i>

2377
02:23:34,882 --> 02:23:36,450
<i>He was unique</i>
<i>and irreplaceable.</i>

2378
02:23:36,518 --> 02:23:38,119
<i>Thousands</i>
<i>of mourners have gathered</i>

2379
02:23:38,185 --> 02:23:39,753
<i>outside the gates</i>
<i>of Graceland...</i>

2380
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:41,489
<i>Using the styles</i>
<i>of white country</i>

2381
02:23:41,556 --> 02:23:43,257
<i>and Black rhythm and blues,</i>

2382
02:23:43,324 --> 02:23:45,860
<i>permanently changed the face</i>
<i>of American popular culture.</i>

2383
02:23:45,926 --> 02:23:48,362
<i>The outpouring</i>
<i>of grief can be seen</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

2384
02:23:48,429 --> 02:23:51,232
<i>He was a symbol</i>
<i>to people the world over,</i>

2385
02:23:51,298 --> 02:23:54,468
<i>of the vitality,</i>
<i>rebelliousness...</i>

2386
02:23:54,536 --> 02:23:57,404
<i>What killed my boy?</i>

2387
02:23:57,471 --> 02:24:00,808
<i>Them doctors say</i>
<i>it was his heart.</i>

2388
02:24:00,875 --> 02:24:03,377
<i>Others, the pills.</i>

2389
02:24:03,444 --> 02:24:06,814
<i>Some say it was me.</i>

2390
02:24:06,881 --> 02:24:10,784
<i>No. I'll tell you</i>
<i>what killed him.</i>

2391
02:24:11,819 --> 02:24:14,889
<i>It was love.</i>

2392
02:24:14,955 --> 02:24:17,424
<i>His love for you.</i>

2393
02:24:19,793 --> 02:24:22,263
<i>You know, a few weeks</i>
<i>before he died,</i>

2394
02:24:22,329 --> 02:24:26,501
<i>I saw him sing</i>
<i>for the very last time.</i>

2395
02:24:26,568 --> 02:24:28,903
<i>He could barely stand up.</i>

2396
02:24:29,937 --> 02:24:32,706
"Unchained Melody."

2397
02:24:32,773 --> 02:24:36,043
From an album called
<i>Unchained Melody.</i>

2398
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:40,047
Makes a lot of sense. Okay.

2399
02:24:40,114 --> 02:24:44,718
<i>But that night,</i>
<i>he sang as he always did.</i>

2400
02:24:44,785 --> 02:24:46,987
<i>With all his heart and soul.</i>

2401
02:24:47,054 --> 02:24:48,689
How you like it so far?

2402
02:24:51,526 --> 02:24:55,062
<i>That old voice</i>
<i>rang out,</i>

2403
02:24:55,129 --> 02:24:59,800
<i>and he sang with all his life.</i>

2404
02:24:59,867 --> 02:25:05,372
<i>Oh, my love</i>

2405
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:07,642
<i>My darling</i>

2406
02:25:07,708 --> 02:25:11,879
<i>I've hungered</i>
<i>for your touch</i>

2407
02:25:11,946 --> 02:25:17,918
<i>A long, lonely time</i>

2408
02:25:20,622 --> 02:25:26,260
<i>Time goes by</i>

2409
02:25:26,327 --> 02:25:28,796
<i>So slowly</i>

2410
02:25:28,862 --> 02:25:33,234
<i>And time can do so much</i>

2411
02:25:33,300 --> 02:25:35,537
<i>Are you</i>

2412
02:25:35,604 --> 02:25:39,940
<i>Still mine?</i>

2413
02:25:40,007 --> 02:25:47,147
<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

2414
02:25:48,349 --> 02:25:53,120
<i>I need your love</i>

2415
02:25:53,187 --> 02:25:58,792
<i>God speed your love</i>

2416
02:25:58,859 --> 02:26:03,397
<i>To me</i>

2417
02:26:04,965 --> 02:26:12,072
<i>Lonely rivers flow to the sea</i>
<i>To the sea</i>

2418
02:26:12,139 --> 02:26:18,445
<i>To the open arms of the sea</i>

2419
02:26:20,582 --> 02:26:27,921
<i>Lonely rivers cry</i>
<i>Wait for me</i>
<i>Wait for me</i>

2420
02:26:28,723 --> 02:26:31,992
<i>I'll be coming home</i>

2421
02:26:32,059 --> 02:26:37,164
<i>Wait for me</i>

2422
02:26:37,231 --> 02:26:42,737
<i>My love, my darling</i>

2423
02:26:42,803 --> 02:26:47,441
<i>I've hungered for your kiss</i>

2424
02:26:48,475 --> 02:26:54,481
<i>A long, lonely time</i>

2425
02:26:54,549 --> 02:26:56,116
<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2426
02:26:56,183 --> 02:26:58,385
<i>I was a dreamer.</i>
<i>I read comic books</i>

2427
02:26:58,452 --> 02:27:01,188
<i>and I was the hero</i>
<i>of the comic book.</i>

2428
02:27:01,255 --> 02:27:04,526
<i>I saw movies and I was</i>
<i>the hero in the movie.</i>

2429
02:27:04,592 --> 02:27:06,827
<i>So every dream</i>
<i>that I ever dreamed</i>

2430
02:27:06,894 --> 02:27:09,296
has come true
a hundred times.

2431
02:27:10,831 --> 02:27:17,572
<i>Are you still mine?</i>

2432
02:27:19,039 --> 02:27:26,180
<i>I need your love, ooh</i>

2433
02:27:29,183 --> 02:27:31,720
I learned very early
in life that...

2434
02:27:31,786 --> 02:27:34,589
"Without a song,
the day would never end,

2435
02:27:34,656 --> 02:27:37,424
without a song,
a man ain't got a friend,

2436
02:27:37,491 --> 02:27:40,795
without a song,
the road would never bend,

2437
02:27:40,861 --> 02:27:41,929
without a song."

2438
02:27:41,995 --> 02:27:43,864
So I keep singing a song.

2439
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:46,701
<i>To...</i>

2440
02:27:46,768 --> 02:27:49,870
<i>Ooh-hoo</i>

2441
02:27:49,937 --> 02:27:54,007
<i>Ooh</i>

2442
02:27:54,576 --> 02:27:55,876
<i>Me</i>

2443
02:28:35,817 --> 02:28:39,019
<i>Elvis has left the building.</i>

2444
02:28:55,235 --> 02:28:59,239
<i>As the snow flies</i>

2445
02:29:00,974 --> 02:29:03,944
<i>On a cold and gray</i>
<i>Chicago mornin'</i>

2446
02:29:04,011 --> 02:29:06,213
<i>A poor little baby child</i>
<i>is born</i>

2447
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:08,215
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2448
02:29:11,619 --> 02:29:15,189
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2449
02:29:16,891 --> 02:29:20,127
<i>'Cause if there's one thing</i>
<i>that she don't need</i>

2450
02:29:20,194 --> 02:29:22,931
<i>Is another hungry mouth</i>
<i>to feed</i>

2451
02:29:22,996 --> 02:29:25,265
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2452
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:30,370
<i>People, don't you understand</i>

2453
02:29:30,437 --> 02:29:33,741
<i>The child needs a helping hand</i>

2454
02:29:33,808 --> 02:29:38,680
<i>Or he'll grow to be</i>
<i>an angry young man some day</i>

2455
02:29:38,746 --> 02:29:41,048
<i>Take a look at you and me</i>

2456
02:29:41,114 --> 02:29:44,519
<i>Are we too blind to see?</i>

2457
02:29:44,586 --> 02:29:50,625
<i>Do we simply turn our heads</i>
<i>And look the other way</i>

2458
02:29:52,192 --> 02:29:56,430
<i>Well, the world turns...</i>

2459
02:30:05,205 --> 02:30:08,208
<i>"You never</i>
<i>stood in that man's shoes</i>

2460
02:30:08,275 --> 02:30:10,645
<i>Or saw things through his eyes</i>

2461
02:30:10,712 --> 02:30:13,313
<i>Or stood and watched</i>
<i>with helpless hands</i>

2462
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:16,250
<i>While the heart inside you dies</i>

2463
02:30:16,316 --> 02:30:19,086
<i>So help your brother</i>
<i>along the way</i>

2464
02:30:19,152 --> 02:30:21,789
<i>No matter where he starts</i>

2465
02:30:21,856 --> 02:30:27,394
<i>For the same God that made you</i>
<i>Made him, too</i>

2466
02:30:27,461 --> 02:30:30,197
<i>These men with broken hearts"</i>

2467
02:30:31,666 --> 02:30:35,102
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2468
02:30:36,971 --> 02:30:39,841
<i>And a hungry, little boy</i>
<i>with a runny nose</i>

2469
02:30:39,908 --> 02:30:42,644
<i>Plays in the street</i>
<i>as the cold wind blows</i>

2470
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:44,411
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2471
02:30:47,782 --> 02:30:51,553
<i>And his hunger burns</i>

2472
02:30:52,854 --> 02:30:55,924
<i>So he starts to roam</i>
<i>the streets at night</i>

2473
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:58,693
<i>And he learns how to steal</i>
<i>And he learns how to fight</i>

2474
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:00,728
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2475
02:31:04,164 --> 02:31:09,604
<i>Then one night in desperation</i>
<i>The young man breaks away</i>

2476
02:31:09,671 --> 02:31:12,339
<i>He buys a gun, steals a car</i>

2477
02:31:12,406 --> 02:31:15,743
<i>Tries to run,</i>
<i>but he don't get far</i>

2478
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:19,614
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2479
02:31:43,738 --> 02:31:46,674
<i>On a cold and gray</i>
<i>Chicago mornin'</i>

2480
02:31:46,741 --> 02:31:50,377
<i>Another little baby child</i>
<i>is born</i>

2481
02:31:50,444 --> 02:31:52,513
<i>In the ghetto</i>

2482
02:32:02,857 --> 02:32:06,159
<i>And his mama cries</i>

2483
02:32:20,541 --> 02:32:24,712
<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

2484
02:32:29,449 --> 02:32:33,988
<i>Summer kisses, winter tears</i>

2485
02:32:34,055 --> 02:32:38,392
<i>That was what she gave to me</i>

2486
02:32:38,458 --> 02:32:42,396
<i>Never thought</i>
<i>I'd travel all alone</i>

2487
02:32:42,462 --> 02:32:48,803
<i>The trail of memories</i>

2488
02:35:22,489 --> 02:35:24,692
<i>Don't tiptoe, stomp my ground</i>

2489
02:35:24,759 --> 02:35:27,327
<i>Gotta let 'em know</i>
<i>we're comin'</i>

2490
02:35:27,394 --> 02:35:29,230
<i>Just stay there, woman</i>

2491
02:35:29,297 --> 02:35:30,998
<i>Engine still runnin'</i>

2492
02:35:31,065 --> 02:35:35,036
<i>Get dressed</i>
<i>Like the whole world watchin'</i>

2493
02:35:35,102 --> 02:35:38,539
<i>God bless</i>
<i>Gotta leave 'em shooken</i>

2494
02:35:38,606 --> 02:35:40,708
<i>Girls goin' wild, too cray</i>

2495
02:35:40,775 --> 02:35:42,844
<i>Look at what you made</i>

2496
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:46,647
<i>Always come correct</i>
<i>There's no turnin' back</i>

2497
02:35:46,714 --> 02:35:48,950
<i>Takin' bigger steps</i>

2498
02:35:49,016 --> 02:35:50,718
<i>That's all I can do</i>

2499
02:35:50,785 --> 02:35:54,421
<i>That's all for the moment</i>
<i>If that's all right with you</i>

2500
02:35:54,487 --> 02:35:56,591
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

2501
02:35:56,657 --> 02:35:58,926
<i>That's all right with you</i>

2502
02:35:58,993 --> 02:36:00,595
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

2503
02:36:00,661 --> 02:36:03,598
<i>Anyway you do, that's all right</i>

2504
02:36:04,265 --> 02:36:06,033
<i>That's all right</i>

2505
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:11,505
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Anyway you do</i>

2506
02:36:11,572 --> 02:36:15,309
<i>We can't go on together</i>

2507
02:36:15,375 --> 02:36:17,945
<i>With suspicious minds</i>

2508
02:36:19,747 --> 02:36:23,718
<i>And we can't build our dreams</i>

2509
02:36:23,784 --> 02:36:26,988
<i>On suspicious minds</i>

2510
02:36:46,807 --> 02:36:53,180
<i>There must be peace</i>
<i>and understanding sometime</i>

2511
02:36:54,548 --> 02:36:56,617
<i>Strong winds of promise</i>

2512
02:36:56,684 --> 02:37:02,290
<i>That will blow away</i>
<i>the doubt and fear</i>

2513
02:37:02,356 --> 02:37:06,594
<i>If I can dream of a warmer sun</i>

2514
02:37:06,661 --> 02:37:10,264
<i>Where hope keeps shining</i>
<i>on everyone</i>

2515
02:37:10,331 --> 02:37:13,768
<i>Tell me why, oh, why,</i>

2516
02:37:13,834 --> 02:37:20,908
<i>Oh, why won't that sun appear</i>

2517
02:37:26,747 --> 02:37:29,717
<i>We're lost in a cloud</i>

2518
02:37:30,584 --> 02:37:34,487
<i>With too much rain</i>

2519
02:37:34,555 --> 02:37:38,225
<i>We're trapped in a world</i>

2520
02:37:38,292 --> 02:37:41,929
<i>That's troubled with pain</i>

2521
02:37:41,996 --> 02:37:48,169
<i>But as long as a man</i>
<i>Has the strength to dream</i>

2522
02:37:48,235 --> 02:37:55,176
<i>He can redeem his soul and fly</i>

2523
02:37:57,078 --> 02:37:59,814
<i>Oh...</i>

2524
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:05,920
<i>Deep in my heart,</i>
<i>there's a trembling question</i>

2525
02:38:07,254 --> 02:38:11,158
<i>Still I am sure</i>
<i>that the answers</i>

2526
02:38:11,225 --> 02:38:14,362
<i>The answers gonna come somehow</i>

2527
02:38:14,428 --> 02:38:22,169
<i>Out there in the dark,</i>
<i>there's a beckoning candle</i>

2528
02:38:22,236 --> 02:38:26,140
<i>And while I can think,</i>
<i>while I can talk</i>

2529
02:38:26,207 --> 02:38:30,511
<i>While I can stand,</i>
<i>while I can walk</i>

2530
02:38:30,578 --> 02:38:33,214
<i>While I can dream</i>

2531
02:38:34,215 --> 02:38:36,984
<i>Please let my dream</i>

2532
02:38:38,119 --> 02:38:42,623
<i>Come true</i>

2533
02:38:45,593 --> 02:38:49,497
<i>Right now</i>

2534
02:38:49,563 --> 02:38:52,033
<i>Let it come true right now</i>

2535
02:38:53,067 --> 02:38:57,038
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

2536
02:39:01,976 --> 02:39:03,377
<i>Thank you.</i>

2537
02:39:03,444 --> 02:39:05,246
<i>You're fantastic.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
