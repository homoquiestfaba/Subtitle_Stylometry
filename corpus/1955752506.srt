1
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:17,204
AGRA 1887

2
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:28,704
BRITAIN HAS FORMALLY RULED
INDIA FOR TWENTY-NINE YEARS

3
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,130
Idiot!

4
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,367
Name?

5
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,371
Jabi.

6
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,753
Hey, you're wanted at
the governor's office.

7
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,382
Ah, Mr Karim.

8
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,362
I wanted to speak to you
about the carpets

9
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,866
we sent to the British Exhibition.

10
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,995
- There is a problem, sir?
- No, no.

11
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,598
The carpets went down very well.

12
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,261
In fact, the Governor General

13
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:53,445
has received a letter
from the Royal Household

14
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,979
thanking him personally.

15
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,392
It's all been such a success,

16
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:59,211
he has decided to present the Queen

17
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,398
with a mohar as part of the Jubilee.

18
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,024
A mohar, sir?

19
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:08,002
A mohar. Apparently some
sort of ceremonial coin.

20
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:10,812
I've been asked to find
someone tall to present it.

21
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:12,676
You're the tallest person here.

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,960
When will she be arriving, sir?

23
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:17,873
Not in Agra, in England!

24
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,782
You will travel to England.

25
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:24,864
And present the mohar
as an official function.

26
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,555
Like an equerry.

27
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,559
On a horse?

28
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:30,734
I don't think
there'll be a horse.

29
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,585
Equerry always has a horse,
Mr Tyler, sir.

30
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,960
Well, maybe not like
an equerry exactly.

31
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:42,200
Morning.

32
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,064
Ah, morning.

33
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:45,800
This is Major Bigge,

34
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:48,787
extra Groom in Waiting
to the Royal Household Windsor

35
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,105
who will be in charge
of your journey.

36
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,127
This is Abdul.

37
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,222
Top hole!
And this is Mohammed,

38
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:57,545
who will also be
presenting the mohar.

39
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:03,434
He's very short.

40
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,527
We had to swop him
at the last moment.

41
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:08,305
The tall chap had an
accident with an elephant.

42
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:23,309
BUCKINGHAM PALACE

43
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,220
Good morning, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,064
At the head is the Lord Chamberlain,

45
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:36,488
then the Private Secretary,
the Deputy Private Secretary,

46
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,186
the Ladies in Waiting,
the Upper Servants,

47
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,881
the lower Upper Servants.

48
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,590
Then the members of the Household:

49
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:42,956
One, the head of the Bedchamber,

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,662
two, the personal head of staff,

51
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,884
three, the Butler in Chief,

52
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,005
who is in charge of
the Household Butler,

53
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,894
the kitchen factotum,
the Head Chef,

54
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,022
the head of waiting staff,
the ordinary waiting staff, Windsor,

55
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,385
the table maids, then you.
Any questions?

56
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,208
Uh-huh, who will have the mohar, sir?

57
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:00,222
I'm not exactly sure as yet.

58
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,393
I suspect you'll both carry it.
On a cushion.

59
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,323
Do we both get a cushion?

60
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:05,398
I really don't know.

61
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:10,125
The key to good service
is standing still and moving backwards.

62
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,945
The most important thing is
you must not look at her.

63
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,985
What an arsehole.

64
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,796
Have you any idea
how cold it is in England?

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,941
We're gonna die there.

66
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,866
Why did you agree to come?

67
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,715
The tall one fell off an elephant,
I wasn't given a choice.

68
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,896
Ugh, five thousand miles
to present a bloody medal

69
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,400
to the oppressor of the
entire Indian subcontinent.

70
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:47,560
You don't realise what a
great honour this is for us.

71
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,293
Have you ever tasted English food?
They eat pig's blood.

72
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:52,593
They do not eat pig's blood.

73
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,953
I'm telling you, they put
pig's blood in the sausages,

74
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,505
and brains of sheep.

75
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,422
Ugh.

76
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,227
The place is completely barbaric.

77
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,400
Give us some money.

78
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Please, sir?

79
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:18,867
Civilisation!

80
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,550
Please, sir, give us a farthing.

81
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,196
Give us a farthing, sir.

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,620
Arms.

83
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:29,760
<i>Arms.</i>

84
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:33,084
We copied them from some drawings

85
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:35,053
in the British Museum.

86
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,057
Splendid!

87
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,200
You do know
the sash is not traditional, sir?

88
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:42,740
The Indian drawings didn't look very...
Indian

89
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,404
so we made some innovations.

90
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,915
The important thing is to look...
authentic.

91
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,977
Looks jolly good to me.

92
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:54,148
<i>Jubilee celebrations:
9:00, breakfast in London,</i>

93
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:55,910
<i>Quarter to ten,
changing of the guard.</i>

94
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,934
11:00, meeting with the
Swedish Ambassador.

95
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:03,370
12:00, luncheon with Oscar II,
King of Sweden and Norway,

96
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,920
<i>the Norwegian Ambassador,</i>

97
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,388
<i>the Chief Undersecretary of State
for the southern Norwegian provinces,</i>

98
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:10,850
<i>the Junior Undersecretary
of State for the</i>

99
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,770
northern Norwegian provinces.

100
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:15,776
2:00, ceremonial drive down the Mall.

101
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Half past two,

102
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,872
tea party at Hyde Park
for 30,000 children.

103
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,500
<i>Half past four,</i>

104
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:26,047
<i>household departs on the
royal train to Windsor.</i>

105
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:29,666
<i>Half past six,
dinner in the Great Hall.</i>

106
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,650
Come on, then,
chop chop!

107
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:34,942
<i>And the ceremonial presentation
of a mohar.</i>

108
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,815
The Hindoos, sir!

109
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,350
But they're completely different sizes.

110
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:52,060
There was an incident, sir,
with an elephant.

111
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:53,424
Hmm.

112
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:54,660
The Queen arrives.

113
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,730
Fanfares.

114
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,146
Ceremonial entrance.

115
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,464
The Royal Entourage
make their way to the table,

116
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:05,712
to be seated thus.

117
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:07,576
Her Majesty.

118
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,540
Sir Henry Ponsonby,
Private Secretary,

119
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,032
the Secretary of State for India,

120
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:13,934
the Emperor of Russia,
Dr Reid, Lady Churchill,

121
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:16,318
Miss Phipps, etcetera,
etcetera. Grace.

122
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:21,675
Soup: potage Saint Germain
with purée de madeleines.

123
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,720
Fish course: morue à huîtres.

124
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,788
Fanfare. Entrée:

Dessert: pain d'épinards,
tartelettes à la Suisse,

127
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:37,530
profiteroles.
Always profiteroles.

128
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:40,973
You will come from the
northwest service entrance.

129
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,171
Process together.

130
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,146
And you will stand here.

131
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,102
No.

132
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,534
A little bit.

133
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,538
That's it.

134
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,383
Presenting the tray thus.

135
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,780
Tray?

136
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:54,867
I-I thought it was a cushion.

137
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:56,605
You will present the tray.

138
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,330
Excuse me...

139
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,921
Do I get a tray?

140
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:00,527
No, we've only got one tray.

141
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,434
Uh-huh. So, what do I do?

142
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,764
You'll just have to improvise.

143
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,880
Whatever you do, you must
not look at Her Majesty.

144
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:10,254
You will bow again.
Then moving backwards,

145
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,158
you will turn to your left.
You will leave thus,

146
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,647
and you will process
down the hall

147
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,212
to be met by Mr Bigge

148
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,387
who will walk you
to the north wall

149
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,960
where you will stand
till the end of the meal.

150
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,880
Would you like me to
run through that again?

151
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:30,270
Mr Yorke, she's heading
to Paddington.

152
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:31,980
Everybody out!

153
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,544
You two, stairs, now.

154
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:44,736
Jesus Christ!

155
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,570
Where are the...
quenelles?

156
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,700
Oi, you two,
out of it!

157
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:53,400
She's at the station, sir!

158
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,101
Jesus H. Christ,
she's at the... station!

159
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:58,874
For God's sake,
just wait where you were told.

160
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:00,395
Open the doors.

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,433
<i>Quenelles!</i>

162
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:03,404
Open the doors!

163
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,222
Open the doors!

164
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:06,774
<i>Open the doors!</i>

165
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,034
She's here.

166
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:46,280
Soup.

167
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,877
Soup!

168
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,450
Soup!

169
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:52,232
Soup!

170
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,055
Soup!

171
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,846
Soup!

172
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,088
Ah, thank heavens.

173
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,665
Soup, Your Majesty.

174
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:28,343
<i>Must you take this one?</i>

175
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,320
I haven't finished it.

176
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:36,287
I-I'm afraid you have to be quick.

177
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,207
They take it off you
as soon as she's done.

178
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,424
One down, six to go.

179
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,300
The morue à huîtres
and then the quenelle.

180
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,346
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,004
The morue à huîtres
and then the quenelle.

182
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,567
This is bloody ridiculous.

183
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:49,990
Two months in a boat
and I haven't even got a tray?

184
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,572
I have the mohar.

185
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:34,250
Is that it?

186
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,340
Your Majesty?

187
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:44,484
Your Majesty?

188
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:49,400
The uh, the profiteroles.

189
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,390
Is that it?

190
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:14,087
The profiteroles have gone.

191
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:17,050
Gentlemen, process.
Turn. Bow. Present.

192
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,170
And absolutely
no eye contact whatsoever.

193
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:06,200
A gift from the Indian Empire.

194
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,262
A mohar, Your Majesty.

195
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,666
A what?

196
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,900
A Mughal coin, Your Majesty

197
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:16,034
in honour of your service
to the uh, subcontinent.

198
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:19,874
Have we finished?

199
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,200
We still have coffee, Your Majesty.

200
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,823
Eyes!

201
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,352
Good morning, Your Majesty.

202
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,043
<i>Breakfast with the
Royal Princes of Belgium.</i>

203
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:17,050
<i>11:00, an audience
with the Sultan of Dubai</i>

204
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:20,990
<i>where Her Majesty will be
presented with the Diamond of Ooojay.</i>

205
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:23,512
<i>Garden party where
Her Majesty will receive</i>

206
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,574
Oscar II, King of Sweden
and Norway, again.

207
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:29,504
And Queen Lili'uokalani.

208
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,985
Who on earth is she?

209
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,564
A monarch and
sole Queen Regnant

210
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,554
of the Kingdom of Hawaii,
Your Majesty.

211
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,465
She has composed a song for you
on the ukulele.

212
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:42,340
But we have managed to put her off.

213
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,884
Then you will eat
with the Prime Minister

214
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:48,558
and at 7:00, the banquet
in the state dining room.

215
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:51,862
And your movements, Your Majesty?

216
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,410
Nothing to speak of, Dr Reid.

217
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,253
Not even during the day?

218
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:58,568
We last moved on Sunday evening.

219
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:03,650
Oh, I feel the celebratory dinners
are taking their toll, Your Majesty.

220
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:06,340
Might I suggest
some Benger's Mixture?

221
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:09,214
I refuse to eat Benger's.
It's baby food.

222
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:12,046
But it is imperative, Your Majesty,

223
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,160
that the royal colon
receives a little roughage.

224
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:16,720
Anything else?

225
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:20,742
Uh, was Her Majesty
pleased with the mohar?

226
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:22,082
What?

227
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:24,370
The mohar, the ceremonial coin.

228
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:28,680
Uh, presented by the
two Indian servants.

229
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:32,563
I thought the tall one
was terribly handsome.

230
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,421
Stop!

231
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,574
Slight change of plan.

232
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:08,894
You must not talk
to any of the guests.

233
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:11,250
Nod or bow but please

234
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:15,225
do not interact with anybody
other than the serving staff.

235
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,762
I will come to you
when the Queen is seated.

236
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:23,456
And you will present
the royal pudding as requested.

237
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,600
Eh, excuse me, sir,

238
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,780
but what is it?

239
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:30,646
That is a jelly. A pudding
made from the liquor of fruit.

240
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,950
How do they get it so stiff?

241
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:35,310
Gelatin.
A byproduct of cow bone.

242
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,820
Barbarians!

243
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:42,600
There's another famine in India.

244
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:46,146
More trouble in Ireland,
I'm afraid.

245
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,555
Suez is a perennial nightmare.

246
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,660
And I'm afraid the Boers
are at it again.

247
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,419
Is there any <i>good</i> news,
Prime Minister?

248
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,690
We've decided to annex Zululand,
Your Majesty.

249
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:56,694
Whatever for?

250
00:18:56,946 --> 00:19:00,600
We really have to box in
the Boers if we possibly can,

251
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:01,604
- Oh, Prime Minister,
- Your Majesty.

252
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,202
you really are terribly depressing.

253
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,206
Yes.

254
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,304
Ah, sandwiches.

255
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:06,191
Mmm.

256
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,352
<i>Splendid!</i>

257
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:18,310
Jelly.

258
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:21,766
Oh.

259
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,970
Splendid.

260
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,220
Jelly, Your Majesty.

261
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,500
I suddenly feel
a great deal better.

262
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:02,150
What the hell were you thinking?!

263
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:03,645
You said present the jelly, sir.

264
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:06,944
I didn't say kiss the feet
of the Empress of India!

265
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:08,400
I-I thought it would cheer her up.

266
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:09,555
Cheer her up?

267
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,700
They'll have me court-martialed!

268
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:13,786
What on earth is going on?

269
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,720
Her Majesty has requested

270
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:19,245
Mr Karim and Mr Baksh

271
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,682
be her personal footmen

272
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,876
for the rest of the Jubilee.

273
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,880
You stupid bloody idiot.

274
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:30,276
All you had to do
was give her jelly.

275
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,560
We could be going home by now.

276
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,874
Ah, gentlemen.
You can wait here by the door.

277
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:40,220
Her Majesty wants you to
stand in here by the writing desk.

278
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,260
Go on.

279
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,546
Thank you.

280
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:53,930
You may go.

281
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:57,230
Oh, thank you, uh
Your Majesty.

282
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,160
Don't worry.

283
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,110
I'm not going to eat you.

284
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:09,140
Doctor Reid,

285
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,324
a very

286
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:14,575
successful

287
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:16,723
movement

288
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:20,402
at 8:00

289
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,000
this morning.

290
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:27,440
What the hell
is going on in there?

291
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,530
Thank you, Mr...

292
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:38,856
Abdul.

293
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:41,530
Abdul Karim.

294
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,510
I am always writing.

295
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,950
In India, I am writing all day.
Every day.

296
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,310
So, in India,
you are not a servant?

297
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:02,214
No.

298
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:04,690
In India, I am writing
in my very big book.

299
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:05,742
You're writing a book?

300
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:06,690
Yes.

301
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm writing every name,

302
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:09,960
who they are,
what they have done.

303
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,725
This is my life.

304
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:14,940
Every day, I'm writing,
from morning to night.

305
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,345
And this is fiction?

306
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:18,635
No. It is the very truth.

307
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,566
I don't understand.

308
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,211
If you are an author,
why are you here?

309
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,622
Presenting me
with the m...

310
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:27,467
- with...
- Mohar.

311
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:31,420
It is my humble privilege
to server Her Majesty.

312
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:40,924
I was the one
who chose your carpets.

313
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,365
Carpets?

314
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:48,300
Yes. The Viceroy asked Mr Tyler, sir,
but actually, it was me.

315
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:51,800
You have to have
a very good eye for the carpets.

316
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,092
Like...this is a very nice one

317
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:56,096
for example.

318
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,050
Very...very tight knots.

319
00:22:58,054 --> 00:23:02,403
The art of carpets
came to India from Persia

320
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:04,480
with the great Emperor Akbar.

321
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,426
The skill of a carpet

322
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,282
is to bring all the different
kinds of threads together

323
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:14,084
and weave something
we can all stand on.

324
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:17,932
You seem to know
a great deal about it.

325
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:21,624
My family were carpet makers.

326
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:23,750
But now I write in the book.

327
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:26,950
Life is like a carpet.

328
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:30,626
We weave in
and out to make a pattern.

329
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:34,700
That is a very beautiful image.

330
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:37,906
Look.

331
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,610
Here is the bird of freedom

332
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:42,734
caught forever in the design.

333
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:50,111
So, in India you are a poet?

334
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:51,250
No.

335
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:54,140
In India, I make a ledger
of the prisoners.

336
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,260
We are all prisoners,
Mr Karim.

337
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,270
Apparently, he's a poet.

338
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:19,761
What the hell
are you playing at?

339
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,645
Stop being so friendly.

340
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:27,520
These people are the exploiters
of a quarter of all of mankind.

341
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:30,333
Do you really think
they give a hoot about us?

342
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:31,337
Huh?

343
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:34,082
Bloody well freeze to death
at this rate.

344
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:37,100
And cut all the nicey-nicey crap
and let's get the hell out of here.

345
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,104
Agreed?

346
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:39,573
I promise.

347
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,293
Goodnight.

348
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,893
Will you stop doing that?!

349
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,392
You realise

350
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,830
this is the third day in a row.

351
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:15,116
So, Mr Abdul...

352
00:25:15,522 --> 00:25:18,780
may I ask what part
of India you're from?

353
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,935
I'm from Agra.

354
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,818
The Taj Mahal?

355
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:24,930
Have you ever been
to the Taj Mahal?

356
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:25,934
No.

357
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:29,620
Oh, it is the most marvellous building
in the entire world, Your Majesty.

358
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:31,980
The Crown of Palaces.

359
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,210
It was built by Shah Jahan
to remember his dead wife

360
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:39,800
who died at childbirth
during their fourteenth child.

361
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,430
Goodness!

362
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,422
He was so upset with grief,

363
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:48,643
he brought the greatest architects
from Persia, Afghanistan

364
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,554
to build the Taj Mahal.

365
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,336
It certainly sounds
a handsome building.

366
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,588
I'd very much like to see it.

367
00:25:55,592 --> 00:25:57,053
Oh, it is beautiful, Your Majesty!

368
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,460
It's all white marble.

369
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,206
All that beauty for the dead Queen.

370
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,400
Mmm. How romantic.

371
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:06,646
Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort,

372
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,696
the Gardens of Shalimar,

373
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,128
the Peacock Throne.

374
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,002
The Peacock Throne?

375
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:14,575
It is the most beautiful
throne in all the world.

376
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,194
And inside the throne
was the Koh-i-Noor.

377
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,386
But I have the Koh-i-Noor.
I wear it as a brooch.

378
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:23,480
- Do you?
- Yes.

379
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:26,864
It wasn't very shiny
so Albert had it recut.

380
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:29,611
What happened
to the Peacock Throne?

381
00:26:30,262 --> 00:26:31,385
They smashed it up.

382
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:33,288
How awful.

383
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,380
They're always smashing things up.

384
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:38,964
The British soldiers have taken
the jewels from the Taj Mahal.

385
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:40,690
British soldiers?

386
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:42,670
Oh, yes, after the Mutiny.

387
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:46,330
But, this is terrible.

388
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:49,176
What can they be talking about?

389
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,160
A servant and an Indian.

390
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:53,800
What on earth
does she see in him?

391
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:57,560
Well, he <i>is</i> rather handsome.

392
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:02,496
What happened to Shah Jahan?

393
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,786
He was overthrown by his son
and died in Agra Fort.

394
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,202
The wickedness of children.

395
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:11,644
They buried him in the Taj Mahal

396
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,604
with his wife, Mumtaz.

397
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,106
They also wrote an inscription:

398
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,340
"Here lies Shah Jahan

399
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:21,730
who left this world for the
Banquet Hall of Eternity."

400
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:24,210
The Banquet Hall of Eternity.

401
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:26,540
I rather like that idea.

402
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:29,070
You seem very well-informed.

403
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:31,890
Oh, these are famous stories of
Uttar Pradesh.

404
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,075
You should go there.

405
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,875
Oh, I can never go there.
I am forbidden.

406
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,174
Forbidden?

407
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,130
They fear I would be assassinated.

408
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:42,086
So, you have never seen an India street?

409
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,193
- Or a stall of spices?
- No.

410
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,665
Oh, oh, the spices.

411
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:50,760
Cumin, coriander,
garam masala.

412
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,820
Garam mas...
What is garam masala?

413
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,770
It is what you put into the sauce.

414
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,420
You have never tasted
Indian food?

415
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:02,230
Dal? Rogan josh?

416
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,611
Biryani with mango chutney?

417
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,102
Mango chutney?

418
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:09,114
Chutney made out of mango.

419
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,745
What is mango?

420
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,760
Mango is the Queen of Fruit.

421
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:16,777
What does it taste like?

422
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:19,370
Like a... an orange...

423
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,387
and a peach.

424
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,390
Hmm.

425
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:26,462
Sir Henry,

426
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,900
I would like a mango.

427
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:30,220
A mango?

428
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:31,773
Yes, I would like to taste a mango.

429
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:36,050
That's impossible, Your Majesty.
They only grow in India.

430
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:38,720
Well, I am Empress of India.
So have one sent.

431
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:45,222
TOP OF THE MOOR,
SCOTLAND

432
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:00,805
Here!

433
00:29:06,922 --> 00:29:08,222
Your Majesty.

434
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,318
Oh.

435
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,830
Thank you.

436
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,812
How do you like your new
Scottish costumes?

437
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,477
They're very scratchy,
Your Majesty.

438
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:25,735
Everything in Scotland is scratchy.

439
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,212
Sir Henry?

440
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:31,931
When does Bertie arrive?

441
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:33,898
Tomorrow, Your Majesty.

442
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:36,260
He's on his way from...
Monte Carlo.

443
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:42,588
It's all right for her.
She's upholstered.

444
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:01,200
Oh, God, I hate Scotland!

445
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:15,955
Ah! Ye must be the Hindoos!

446
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,375
Very nice to meet ye.

447
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,396
Ye must be the Hindoos.

448
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,586
Ye.

449
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,046
Must.

450
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,125
Be.

451
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:24,653
The.

452
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,657
Hin.

453
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:26,661
Doos.

454
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,111
More! More! More!

455
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,267
More!

456
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,032
I wish she'd bloody well
go to bed.

457
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:47,150
<i>Hey!</i>

458
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,708
Good morning, Your Majesty.

459
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:09,450
The boxes, Your Majesty.

460
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:10,454
Thank you.

461
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:14,392
And the uh, the blank journal
Your Majesty requested.

462
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:21,684
You may go.

463
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,488
I'm perfectly capable
of working through the boxes.

464
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:28,437
Abdul is very helpful with his blotter.

465
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,928
Oh, but these are
parliamentary papers, Your Majesty.

466
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:32,220
I'm aware of that.

467
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,828
But Abdul is a servant.

468
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:36,999
He cannot assist with the boxes.

469
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,350
And I am the Queen of England.

470
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:41,760
I will have whatever help
I require with the boxes.

471
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,990
And Sir Henry,

472
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,400
would you get some
gloves for the Hindus?

473
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:57,590
They're suffering terribly
from the cold.

474
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:08,900
He's helping her with the boxes.

475
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:11,980
I want you to teach me Indian.

476
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:14,001
Indian?

477
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:16,352
Hindu, whatever it is you speak.

478
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:19,100
Are you sure?

479
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,320
Of course, I'm sure.

480
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:23,670
But why would you like to
learn Hindi, Your Majesty?

481
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:25,188
Well, I am Empress of India.

482
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:27,950
Look, I've ordered a book.

483
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:29,690
I want you to give me
private lessons.

484
00:32:31,438 --> 00:32:33,980
I can't teach you Hindi,
Your Majesty.

485
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,260
Why ever not?

486
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:37,060
You are the Empress of India.

487
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:39,160
You should learn Urdu.

488
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:40,600
The language of the Mughals.

489
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,363
There are a thousand languages in India

490
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:45,955
but Urdu is the most noble.

491
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,898
May...
in Hindi...

492
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:53,900
you write like this.

493
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,300
- Hmm.
- but in Urdu...

494
00:32:57,404 --> 00:32:59,780
you write like this.

495
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:03,670
Mairn raini hoom.

496
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:05,394
I am the Queen.

497
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:06,444
I see.

498
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:11,494
Mairn

499
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:12,970
May...

500
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:15,567
raini

501
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:18,966
ranee... runny?

502
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,550
hoom. hoom.

503
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:21,940
hooo.

504
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:23,109
- Hoom.
- Hoom.

505
00:33:23,113 --> 00:33:24,907
- Hmoo.
- Hoom, hoom, hoom.

506
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:27,505
He's teaching her Hindu.

507
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:29,706
Is that allowed?

508
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,897
Ahem, I think you will find
it is Urdu.

509
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:35,770
The Muslim version.

510
00:33:35,874 --> 00:33:37,150
Oh, my goodness me!

511
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,007
Ranee...

512
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:40,340
hoom.

513
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,140
That's it!

514
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:43,630
You are the Queen.

515
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:47,175
The Queen is
very wise.

516
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,422
Raini

517
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,312
kafi

518
00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:57,812
akal man

519
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:00,792
You see?

520
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:02,576
Now you write it down.

521
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,775
- Raini
- Raini

522
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,429
kafi

523
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:24,576
She's writing in her journal

524
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,666
and she's speaking in Hindustani!

525
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,500
It's Urdu, actually.

526
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,440
The Muslim version.

527
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,660
Apani

528
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:43,974
knee

529
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:45,200
Up, up, knee?

530
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:46,204
Knee?

531
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,208
Knee.

532
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,650
Up a knee,
Apani!

533
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,365
Ap, ap, apani!

534
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,538
Yes! Yes!

535
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:10,000
Thank you, Abdul.
You are an excellent teacher.

536
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:15,530
- Bertie!
- Mother!

537
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:17,720
Were you spying on me?

538
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,130
Were you learning Urdu?

539
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:20,334
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

540
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:22,200
You think that's
entirely appropriate?

541
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,950
I am Empress of India,
what could be more appropriate?

542
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:27,050
But in front of the entire Household?

543
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,800
You're absolutely right.

544
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:33,530
I have no privacy here.

545
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:35,670
Sir Henry?

546
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:38,830
I would like to go with Abdul
to Glassalt Shiel.

547
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:40,570
Glassalt Shiel?

548
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,170
Alone.

549
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:47,720
But I've only just got here!

550
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:40,710
Oh, to be by oneself

551
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:45,160
and live a simple
rudimentary existence.

552
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,975
They don't understand anything.

553
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:54,270
These stupid aristocratic fools.

554
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,380
Toadying around,
jockeying for position.

555
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,420
I've had it all my life.

556
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:05,930
Ha. They couldn't bear me bringing
dear John Brown here.

557
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:11,050
I was happier here than
anywhere in the entire world.

558
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:15,590
Oh, I miss him, Abdul.

559
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:20,340
And Albert.

560
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:27,160
It's thirty years now,
and I think of him every day.

561
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:33,200
I'm so lonely.

562
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,800
Everyone I've really loved has died.

563
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:40,500
And I just go on and on.

564
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,250
Oh, Your Majesty.

565
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,670
It's an impossible position.

566
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:04,260
No one really knows
what it's like to be Queen.

567
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:11,550
I'm hated by millions of people
all over the world.

568
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:18,560
I have had nine children,
all vain and jealous,

569
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,765
and at loggerheads with each other.

570
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:24,370
And Bertie's a complete
embarrassment.

571
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,150
And look at me.

572
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:32,755
A fat, lame, impotent,
silly old woman.

573
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,320
What is the point, Abdul?

574
00:38:39,824 --> 00:38:41,760
What is the point?

575
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:46,360
Service.

576
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:48,464
Service?

577
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:52,640
I think we are not here
to worry about ourselves.

578
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:54,780
We are here
for a greater purpose.

579
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,820
In the Koran, it says,

580
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:59,760
we are here
for the good of others.

581
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,140
The Koran?

582
00:39:01,144 --> 00:39:04,565
Yes. I am a Hafiz.
I know the Koran by heart.

583
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,290
By heart. Isn't it very long?

584
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:07,960
114 Surahs

585
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,600
containing
6,236 verses.

586
00:39:10,604 --> 00:39:12,150
And you know every word?

587
00:39:12,154 --> 00:39:14,044
Many Muslim people
know the Koran.

588
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:17,746
I thought you were Hindu.

589
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,470
I am a Muslim, Your Majesty.

590
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,363
I learnt the Koran from my father.

591
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:23,754
He is my Munshi.

592
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:26,360
Munshi?

593
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,154
Yes, Munshi. My teacher.

594
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:35,499
Well, we would like you
to be the Queen's Munshi.

595
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:45,495
But I'm only a servant,
Your Majesty.

596
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:48,082
A servant cannot be a Munshi.

597
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,800
Well, you are a servant no longer.

598
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,820
You are my teacher.

599
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,520
You will teach me Urdu
and the Koran,

600
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,950
and anything else
you could think of.

601
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:03,310
<i>So...</i>

602
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:06,200
What the hell is a Munshi?

603
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,204
Well, apparently it's some sort of uh...

604
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,310
spiritual teacher, Your
Royal Highness.

605
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:12,375
I mean, has she completely
lost her mind?

606
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,665
She's the head of the Church
of England, for God's sake.

607
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:17,250
What's the Archbishop of
Canterbury going to say?

608
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:19,700
I say he's the <i>brown</i> John Brown.

609
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:21,900
Oh, my God.

610
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:24,500
Your Majesty.

611
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:26,800
Good evening, Bertie.

612
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:28,160
Mother.

613
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:35,204
What the hell are you wearing?

614
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,100
Dinner is served.

615
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:41,200
Lady Churchill was
absolutely scandalised.

616
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:42,620
Sitting next to a servant.

617
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:44,265
And a Hindoo to boot!

618
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:46,420
The Munshi is a Muslim scholar.

619
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:48,765
And knows the Koran
off by heart

620
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:52,960
And for your information,
is a servant no longer.

621
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,200
He is to be given
a staff of his own.

622
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,570
What do you mean, a staff?

623
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:58,830
The little fat one.

624
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,540
Oh, this is absurd!

625
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,300
Letters, invitations to supper.

626
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:04,300
You're treating him like
a member of the family.

627
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:06,570
No, I like Abdul.

628
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:09,510
Lady Churchill had better
get used to the fact.

629
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,500
As the Munshi is coming
on holiday with us

630
00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:14,504
as a member of the Household.

631
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:18,120
You can't take a Muslim to Florence.

632
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:21,900
I can take a Muslim
wherever I like.

633
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:24,004
Goodnight, Bertie.

634
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,100
Munshi?

635
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,400
Yes.

636
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,700
A spiritual advisor?

637
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,629
You haven't an idea in your head.

638
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:34,980
You promised to get us
out of here.

639
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:36,550
And now we're going to
bloody Florence.

640
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:38,860
You don't see what
a privilege it is to see

641
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,564
the glories of Italy with
all these wonderful people?

642
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,160
You complete bloody idiot.

643
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:44,700
Do you think they're just
going to stand there

644
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,940
and let her promote a wog?

645
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:48,640
I did not come here
to carry your bloody cases.

646
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:50,060
What are you complaining about?

647
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,215
We have our own carriage.

648
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,400
With a bathroom.

649
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:56,500
They've made a very nice
bed for you on the floor.

650
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:00,120
Oh, I'm dying here.

651
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:01,820
I want to go home.

652
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:04,511
I'm getting sick of your
negative attitude.

653
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:08,420
Life is a big adventure.

654
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:11,500
You just need to open up
and enjoy it.

655
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:13,573
We're on holiday.

656
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:16,940
What-what on earth
could possibly go wrong?

657
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:20,444
'Do Not Pull.'

658
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:29,970
I would like to apologise
for the emergency brakes,

659
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:31,100
Your Majesty.

660
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:33,604
And I hope you did not
get injured.

661
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:36,825
Oh, Abdul, it was nothing.

662
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,888
It was a perfectly
understandable mistake.

663
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:42,454
I'm so glad you're with us.

664
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,658
What a treat to show you Florence...

665
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:44,982
What's he doing here?

666
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:47,686
Abdul came to explain
what happened earlier.

667
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,470
Mother, I really don't see why
I have to share your bathroom.

668
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:53,436
I shared a bed with my mother
until I became Queen.

669
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,840
I am 57 years old.

670
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,875
The Munshi's got his own bathroom.

671
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:59,220
- Yes, very fine bathroom...
- Yes! Yes!

672
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:01,490
Goodnight, Ma-mah!

673
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:03,164
Goodnight, Mr Bertie.

674
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:05,213
Bertie, make sure
you shut that door.

675
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:12,476
Abdul...

676
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,150
I have something for you.

677
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:19,456
To celebrate your
first visit to Florence.

678
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,615
And for becoming my Munshi.

679
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:26,200
It is a locket.

680
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:30,271
With a picture of me.

681
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,300
How can I ever thank you,
Your Majesty?

682
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:43,000
Keep me safe.

683
00:43:45,195 --> 00:43:46,500
Forever.

684
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:49,100
Oh, Abdul.

685
00:43:50,505 --> 00:43:52,586
You will love Florence.

686
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:56,654
Such wonderful views.

687
00:44:04,427 --> 00:44:06,170
Isn't it glorious?

688
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:08,174
Albert loved it here.

689
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:11,220
He so admired the Medicis.

690
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:15,160
That they commissioned
the greatest artists of the day.

691
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:19,360
In order to leave something
astonishing behind.

692
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:23,363
In India also, we commissioned
great artists.

693
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:26,760
Each emperor would bring
the greatest craftsmen

694
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,894
to make great glories
for their Durbar Room.

695
00:44:30,198 --> 00:44:32,100
- Durbar Room?
- Ah, yes.

696
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,100
Every emperor had a Durbar Room.

697
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,795
Full of the finest things
known to man.

698
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:38,580
Well, I am the Empress of India.

699
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:40,230
I should have a Durbar Room.

700
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:42,036
That's a wonderful idea,
Your Majesty.

701
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,573
But where would you put it?

702
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,200
Oh, the Isle of Wight, obviously.

703
00:44:47,704 --> 00:44:51,136
Your Majesty,
Signor Puccini has arrived.

704
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:55,173
♪ Deh! non cessare ♪

705
00:44:55,477 --> 00:44:59,660
♪ deh, non cessar ♪

00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:03,800

Shhh.

00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:15,471

710
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:20,960

712
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:31,800
Oh!

713
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:35,074
Where did you say it was from,
Mr Puccini?

714
00:45:35,278 --> 00:45:37,900
From my new opera,
Your Majesty.

715
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:39,520
<i>Manon Lescaut</i>

716
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:43,150
About two lovers
who are separated

717
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:45,652
by the class divide.

718
00:45:46,508 --> 00:45:48,690
But they run away together.

719
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:50,666
Oh, it sounds marvellous.

720
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,211
But she is imprisoned
for her love.

721
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:54,668
Oh.

722
00:45:54,872 --> 00:45:56,535
But they escape.

723
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:57,539
Bravo!

724
00:45:57,543 --> 00:46:00,226
But finally she dies

725
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,042
and he is utterly bereft.

726
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:08,974
I'm not sure we do like
the sound of it after all.

727
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:12,950
We prefer comic opera.

728
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:15,130
Do you know any
Gilbert and Sullivan?

729
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:18,880
Perhaps Your Majesty
will sing us a song?

730
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:21,314
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't possibly.

731
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:25,200
Oh, of course, of course.
Yes, Your Majesty.

732
00:46:25,604 --> 00:46:27,453
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- No, really.

733
00:46:27,857 --> 00:46:28,957
Oh, well.

734
00:46:29,361 --> 00:46:31,100
Maybe just one.

735
00:46:32,763 --> 00:46:35,860
From <i>Pinafore</i>, Bertie?

736
00:46:36,064 --> 00:46:37,304

762
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:07,800
I haven't been as
happy as this for years.

763
00:48:08,004 --> 00:48:11,050
When I first came to England,

764
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:13,830
I was terrified of you.

765
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:17,620
But you're a very kind lady.

766
00:48:18,578 --> 00:48:21,855
A very unique lady to me.

767
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:27,300
And you are very, very
unique to me, Abdul.

768
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:30,500
I know that you are much
older than me.

769
00:48:32,004 --> 00:48:33,500
And...

770
00:48:33,604 --> 00:48:35,853
you are the Queen of England.

771
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:38,540
And the Empress of India.

772
00:48:38,844 --> 00:48:42,100
I am just a humble Munshi.

773
00:48:43,695 --> 00:48:47,300
But I think

774
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,850
you are the most special person
in my whole life.

775
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:55,340
Even more special than my wife.

776
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,760
Wife?

777
00:49:00,364 --> 00:49:01,600
Yes.

778
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,904
You're married?

779
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:08,800
Of course.

780
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:11,200
Where is your wife?

781
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:15,104
In India.

782
00:49:15,408 --> 00:49:17,700
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

783
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:21,355
I didn't think it mattered.

784
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,834
Well, of course it matters.

785
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:24,585
It changes everything.

786
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,955
You must return
to India immediately.

787
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:32,370
And bring her back at once.

788
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:42,374
OSBORNE HOUSE,
ISLE OF WIGHT

789
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:53,310
<i>How is the weather
in Agra these days?</i>

790
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:05,380
Bloody hell.

791
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:10,800
He's coming!

792
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:33,283
How terribly exciting!

793
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:57,950
It's Alibaba!

794
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,524
Look at the size of him.

795
00:50:59,628 --> 00:51:01,210
Where'd he get those medals?

796
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,320
What the devil is she wearing?

797
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,115
You can't even see her face.

798
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,600
She looks rather splendid!

799
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:26,270
But you cannot actually see her,
Your Majesty.

800
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,330
I think it's rather dignified.

801
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,680
Who the hell is that?

802
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:33,911
Get the bags, boy.

803
00:51:34,415 --> 00:51:36,340
He's brought a serving boy.

804
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:43,000
Good God, another one!
How many has he got in there?

805
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,265
Ruddy sod's a bigamist.

806
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:52,200
I do hope they like
their little cottage.

807
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:57,850
Your Majesty.

808
00:51:58,054 --> 00:51:59,846
I hope it's not inconvenient.

809
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,820
I just thought we'd
pop round for tea.

810
00:52:02,124 --> 00:52:03,100
Oh.

811
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:11,950
This is my granddaughter,
Sophia, Queen of Greece,

812
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:15,932
and this is the Grand Duchess
Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,

813
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:19,530
and my daughter,
Princess Helena Augusta Viktoria

814
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:23,370
of Schleswig-Holstein-
Sonderburg-Augustenburg.

815
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,500
This is my wife, Mrs Karim,

816
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:27,181
and this is my mother-in-law.

817
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,055
Your Majesty,
Sophia, Queen of Greece,

818
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,010
Grand Duchess Sophie
of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,

819
00:52:34,114 --> 00:52:36,650
Princess Helena Augusta Viktoria

820
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:40,560
of Schleswig-Holstein-
Sonderburg-Augustenburg,

821
00:52:42,085 --> 00:52:44,390
I would like to take this opportunity

822
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,212
on behalf of myself,

823
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:49,530
my wife, and my wife's mother

824
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:51,230
to thank Her Majesty

825
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,234
for accommodating us.

826
00:52:52,238 --> 00:52:56,180
We are very grateful
for her infinite kindness

827
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:58,100
and interior decoration.

828
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:03,480
The gift of hospitality
and friendship to strangers

829
00:53:03,484 --> 00:53:06,100
is of very high importance
in our culture.

830
00:53:06,304 --> 00:53:10,525
And so, we are honoured to repay it
in our own small way.

831
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:13,620
What is ours is yours.

832
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:14,840
Quite literally.

833
00:53:15,044 --> 00:53:16,480
Thanks be to Allah.

834
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:19,560
My dear Munshi,

835
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,020
we're so glad to have you here,
my children.

836
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:24,275
We've missed you enormously.

837
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:27,890
I can't wait to show you
the Durbar Room.

838
00:53:28,194 --> 00:53:29,722
Children?

839
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:32,960
Ponsonby, you will have
to do something about this.

840
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:35,700
My dear Munshi,
I'm so glad you're back.

841
00:53:35,904 --> 00:53:38,500
It's been dreadfully dull
without you.

842
00:53:38,704 --> 00:53:41,500
And I'm so glad to meet
Mrs Karim.

843
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:45,700
There is just one thing

844
00:53:45,704 --> 00:53:48,100
I've been curious about
the whole afternoon.

845
00:53:49,156 --> 00:53:51,442
What does she look like
behind her veil?

846
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:53,200
You must see her.

847
00:53:53,304 --> 00:53:54,550
Is that allowed?

848
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:56,100
You are a lady,

849
00:53:56,304 --> 00:53:58,100
and the Empress of India.

850
00:53:58,104 --> 00:53:58,904
Oh!

851
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:01,420
Well, where the bloody hell
is she going now?

852
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,990
Your Majesty.

853
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,699
Oh.

854
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:42,965
You really are beautiful.

855
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:47,100
What on earth is a Durbar Room?

856
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,880
It's a celebration of all things
Indian, Prime Minister.

857
00:54:49,884 --> 00:54:51,980
Inspired by the Mughal Emperors.

858
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:53,940
But I don't understand.

859
00:54:53,944 --> 00:54:56,520
Who gave her permission
to build this in the first place?

860
00:54:56,724 --> 00:54:59,710
Don't blame me.
I was in Monte Carlo.

861
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:01,650
I'm afraid she's a law
unto herself, Prime Minister.

862
00:55:01,754 --> 00:55:04,520
For God's sake.
She'll be wearing a burqa next.

863
00:55:05,024 --> 00:55:06,330
Prime Minister.

864
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:07,930
You are late.

865
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,960
I am terribly sorry, Your Majesty.

866
00:55:10,164 --> 00:55:12,125
Well, let us begin.

867
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:16,326
This as you can see
is the Indian corridor.

868
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:22,000
The Durbar Room was designed
by Mr Bhai Ram Singh.

869
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:26,180
The place is crawling with them.

870
00:55:26,284 --> 00:55:29,390
We have commissioned a series
of portraits of eminent Indians.

871
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:30,730
This...

872
00:55:31,197 --> 00:55:33,520
Princess Gouramma.

873
00:55:33,524 --> 00:55:35,240
And this, of course...

874
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,550
is the Munshi.

875
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,100
Honoured to meet you,
Mr Prime Minister, sir.

876
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,490
A good likeness,
don't you think?

877
00:55:43,895 --> 00:55:46,940
I had asked him to take
a few pounds off.

878
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,925
This is my wife,
Mr Prime Minister, sir.

879
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:53,105
And that is my
mother-in-law.

880
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:55,850
At least I think that's
the right way round.

881
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:02,075
These are my servants,
Mohammed and Ahmed.

882
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:05,286
And this
is the Durbar Room.

883
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,176
What the hell is
going on here, Ponsonby?

884
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:19,055
The carvings are from
Uttar Pradesh.

885
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,220
And the carpet was woven
in a jail in Agra.

886
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:25,530
Perfect, I think,
for the tableaux.

887
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,450
But the pièce de résistance

888
00:56:28,454 --> 00:56:31,400
is the Peacock Throne.

889
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:34,324
An exact copy
of the one at Agra.

890
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,100
And of course, the Koh-i-Noor.

891
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:43,000
Now I really do feel
like the Empress of India.

892
00:56:43,684 --> 00:56:45,960
I thought she was
supposed to be dying.

893
00:56:46,064 --> 00:56:49,364
It really is a remarkable
addition to the house, Your Majesty.

894
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:51,910
We have Abdul to thank
for the whole idea.

895
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:54,642
To celebrate the
completion of the Durbar Room.

896
00:56:54,646 --> 00:56:56,946
A little surprise, Your Majesty.

897
00:56:59,525 --> 00:57:00,625
What is it?

898
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:03,500
A mango, Your Majesty.

899
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:06,426
One moment, Your Majesty.

900
00:57:11,885 --> 00:57:15,882
Eh, it-it's... off.

901
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:19,220
Sir Henry.

902
00:57:19,224 --> 00:57:21,140
This mango is off.

903
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:28,315
I'm-I'm terribly sorry,
Your Majesty.

904
00:57:31,134 --> 00:57:34,390
Take one of these
whenever you see the Munshi.

905
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:38,700
I can't wait to show you
the tableau, Prime Minister.

906
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:44,330
A line has definitively been crossed.

907
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:47,784
I can't go onstage like this.

908
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:49,650
I'm absolutely sick.

909
00:57:49,654 --> 00:57:50,854
Oh, but you have to.

910
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:52,800
The Prime Minister will be watching.

911
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:55,150
This is a complete and utter disaster.

912
00:57:57,094 --> 00:57:58,500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

913
00:57:58,504 --> 00:57:59,700
They've been waiting for this.

914
00:57:59,704 --> 00:58:01,000
Who? Who have?

915
00:58:01,004 --> 00:58:02,400
Ponsonby, Reid,
the whole damn lot.

916
00:58:02,404 --> 00:58:03,600
- Uh-huh.
- Don't you see?

917
00:58:03,604 --> 00:58:05,910
She's been rubbing their noses in it.
But now, it's going public.

918
00:58:05,914 --> 00:58:08,200
I'm telling you, they're
not going to stand for it.

919
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:10,390
They'll rise up and
chop your bloody balls off.

920
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:11,850
Yeah, but I haven't done anything.

921
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:14,785
You stupid, bloody Uncle Tom.
You can't win on their terms.

922
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:19,989
Mrs Munshi!

923
00:58:22,993 --> 00:58:24,450
Bertie.

924
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:31,700
I've never been so humiliated
in my entire life.

925
00:58:32,727 --> 00:58:35,550
Actually, I'm rather enjoying it.

926
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,885
Beginners onstage, please.

927
00:58:40,089 --> 00:58:43,400
A scene in ancient Persia.

928
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:51,765
I am the Sultan of Persia!

929
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:55,060
The King of all Kings.

930
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,887
Your Highness,

931
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,540
we bestow upon you

932
00:59:14,644 --> 00:59:17,250
all the riches of the Orient.

933
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:27,576
You are now
under my power.

934
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,115
Bravo! Bravo!
The Munshi!

935
00:59:58,633 --> 01:00:00,420
What the hell is this, Ponsonby?

936
01:00:00,424 --> 01:00:02,200
Munshi mania?

937
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:04,400
I'm trying to keep
an Empire together.

938
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:06,310
Looks like they're running the place.

939
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:10,123
I want this whole sodding mess
knocked on the head.

940
01:00:10,127 --> 01:00:11,696
Or you're finished.

941
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,120
Understood?

942
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:23,500
Oh, Sir Henry.

943
01:00:23,504 --> 01:00:27,686
Tell us what exactly did the Prime
Minister said about the tableau.

944
01:00:28,448 --> 01:00:32,388
Well uh, to be entirely frank,
Your Majesty

945
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:34,800
he seemed to be
a little perturbed.

946
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:35,944
Whatever for?

947
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:38,015
He must have liked the Munshi.

948
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:40,730
I think the Munshi
was the problem, Your Majesty.

949
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:42,720
Really? I thought
he was rather good.

950
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:43,940
I think he meant his position.

951
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,424
I think he was rather
alarmed he had such a

952
01:00:46,528 --> 01:00:49,200
prominent role in the household.

953
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:51,580
Well, of course Abdul has
a prominent role in the household.

954
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:53,025
He is my Munshi.

955
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:55,245
But he's an Indian,
Your Majesty.

956
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:57,250
I am aware of that.

957
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:00,490
Given current sensitivities
in the subcontinent, Your Majesty.

958
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:03,640
The Prime Minister was concerned
that it might be

959
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:06,400
sending the wrong message.

960
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,145
I should have thought it was
a jolly good message.

961
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:11,830
But he's a Muslim, Your Majesty.

962
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,250
Precisely.

963
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,820
We owe them so much,
do we not?

964
01:01:16,784 --> 01:01:19,050
For their role in the Mutiny,
for example.

965
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:22,400
The Mutiny, Your Majesty?

966
01:01:22,404 --> 01:01:24,725
Yes, for the help
they gave us with the Hindus.

967
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:33,520
Ah, but the Mutiny was
a Muslim-led revolt, Your Majesty.

968
01:01:36,424 --> 01:01:37,970
Are you sure?

969
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:39,340
Of course.

970
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:43,040
The Muslim soldiers revolted
when it was rumoured

971
01:01:43,045 --> 01:01:46,100
that their rifles were
greased with pork fat.

972
01:01:49,243 --> 01:01:50,800
Really?

973
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:53,160
The Grand Mufti, himself,

974
01:01:53,464 --> 01:01:57,322
put out a fatwa against
you personally, Your Majesty.

975
01:01:57,326 --> 01:02:02,750
And Muslim soldiers murdered
over 2,000 British personnel.

976
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:08,100
Who have you been
talking to, Mother?

977
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:13,796
Ta-da!

978
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,910
I have opened my heart to you.

979
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:20,850
I brought your family from India.

980
01:02:21,054 --> 01:02:23,999
I promoted you in face
of considerable opposition

981
01:02:24,003 --> 01:02:25,811
and disquiet from the Household.

982
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:29,920
I even turned a blind eye
when you failed to tell me

983
01:02:29,924 --> 01:02:33,252
that you were married, which,
as you know, came as quite a surprise.

984
01:02:33,256 --> 01:02:35,888
How could you let me
humiliate myself

985
01:02:35,892 --> 01:02:37,735
in front of the entire Household?

986
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:40,000
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

987
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:43,310
You said the Hindus
were behind the Mutiny.

988
01:02:43,714 --> 01:02:45,600
I didn't say it was only the Hindus.

989
01:02:45,604 --> 01:02:48,333
You told me categorically
the Muslims were my friends.

990
01:02:48,337 --> 01:02:49,700
We are your friends, Your Ma...

991
01:02:49,705 --> 01:02:51,684
Abdul, there is a fatwa against me.

992
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:54,030
It was the Muslims
who started the whole thing.

993
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:56,292
This is completely unacceptable!

994
01:02:59,549 --> 01:03:01,825
Abdul, I thought you were

995
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:04,423
outstanding as the Sultan of Persia

996
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:06,400
but I'm afraid
you have to go home.

997
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:18,042
You hurt my feelings very much indeed.

998
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:21,515
Don't you see the position
you have put me in?

999
01:03:26,665 --> 01:03:29,420
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

1000
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:32,300
I will miss you a very great deal.

1001
01:03:58,404 --> 01:03:59,615
So.

1002
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,785
We're going home?

1003
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:32,600
Goodnight, Mother.

1004
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:34,577
Goodnight.

1005
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:50,694
Mrs Tuck.

1006
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:52,612
Mrs Tuck!

1007
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:06,940
Abdul.

1008
01:06:08,556 --> 01:06:10,250
You have been an utter fool.

1009
01:06:10,254 --> 01:06:12,500
And I am absolutely furious with you.

1010
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,020
It it unconscionable
that as my Munshi

1011
01:06:16,024 --> 01:06:18,035
you should have
lied to me in any way.

1012
01:06:18,939 --> 01:06:23,600
But it would be also
completely churlish of me

1013
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:29,754
not to recognise the considerable
kindness and devotion you've shown.

1014
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:35,693
I suppose in some way
you thought you were protecting me.

1015
01:06:36,883 --> 01:06:38,967
But as the monarch,
I realise

1016
01:06:38,971 --> 01:06:42,220
that nothing
can really protect me.

1017
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:47,160
And so in that light
I have decided, although

1018
01:06:47,164 --> 01:06:48,972
I'm very disappointed,

1019
01:06:50,972 --> 01:06:52,815
that I want you to stay.

1020
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,955
Your Gracious Majesty!
Thank you.

1021
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:58,959
Your Majesty!

1022
01:06:59,163 --> 01:07:00,370
Abdul,

1023
01:07:00,374 --> 01:07:02,524
there is something we must sort out.

1024
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,800
I am deeply concerned
about Mrs Karim.

1025
01:07:08,804 --> 01:07:10,600
Mrs Karim?

1026
01:07:12,218 --> 01:07:13,900
By now, one would be expected

1027
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:18,296
to hear the pitter-patter
of little Muslim feet

1028
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,805
along the corridors
of Osborne House.

1029
01:07:23,509 --> 01:07:26,365
I am concerned
that everything is

1030
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:30,400
functioning below sex.

1031
01:07:33,689 --> 01:07:36,070
I want you to examine
Mrs Karim.

1032
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,940
Examine Mrs Karim?

1033
01:07:38,944 --> 01:07:39,700
Hmm.

1034
01:07:40,537 --> 01:07:44,625
Just uh, make sure
that everything's... working.

1035
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:47,329
But Your Majesty, I...

1036
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:50,522
I thought the Munshi and his family
were leaving us.

1037
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:52,350
Whatever gave you that impression?

1038
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:58,270
The Munshi and his family are
integral parts of the Royal Household.

1039
01:08:00,724 --> 01:08:02,090
<i>As far as I'm concerned</i>

1040
01:08:02,094 --> 01:08:04,220
this is war.
We're going to dig up

1041
01:08:04,224 --> 01:08:06,600
every last bit of dirt
this blaggard's ever done.

1042
01:08:06,604 --> 01:08:09,588
I want someone in India
raking through the family coals.

1043
01:08:09,592 --> 01:08:11,300
Your son's out there,
isn't he, Ponsonby?

1044
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:14,680
I couldn't possibly be involved
in subterfuge, Your Royal Highness.

1045
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,880
Look, very soon
I am going to be King.

1046
01:08:17,884 --> 01:08:20,374
You will bloody well
do as you are told!

1047
01:08:21,858 --> 01:08:23,320
You'll leave no stone unturned.

1048
01:08:23,324 --> 01:08:24,460
You will make a dossier

1049
01:08:24,464 --> 01:08:25,875
and you will put it all down
in black and white.

1050
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:28,000
And put an end
to all this shit!

1051
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,715
For good.

1052
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:40,152
Well, I better go
and examine Mrs Munshi.

1053
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:44,430
Oh, Dr Reid.

1054
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:46,415
Do come in.

1055
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:50,050
She'll have to uncover her face.

1056
01:08:50,254 --> 01:08:52,250
That is impossible, sir.

1057
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,350
I need to see her tongue.

1058
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:04,850
Well?

1059
01:09:05,454 --> 01:09:06,700
She's fine.

1060
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,340
Mr Mohammed.

1061
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:22,020
We have come here because
we are not unaware

1062
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,340
of your predicament.

1063
01:09:23,344 --> 01:09:26,740
That you arrived in the first place
almost by accident

1064
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:28,360
and now find yourself stuck here

1065
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,970
through a bizarre
set of circumstances

1066
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:32,660
none of your own making.

1067
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,800
Nor is it beneath our notice that

1068
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:38,100
the uh, inclement English weather

1069
01:09:38,104 --> 01:09:40,360
has been the cause
of a precipitous decline

1070
01:09:40,364 --> 01:09:41,975
in your general health.

1071
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:45,340
What is more,

1072
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:50,170
you continue to suffer
the vast indignity

1073
01:09:50,174 --> 01:09:52,930
of being a servant to someone
who is in many ways

1074
01:09:52,934 --> 01:09:54,530
your inferior.

1075
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:57,055
So, it occurred to us that, um

1076
01:09:58,351 --> 01:10:01,030
we might be able to
offer you some help.

1077
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,440
Help?

1078
01:10:05,444 --> 01:10:09,150
Travel home.
Perhaps a modest pension.

1079
01:10:09,354 --> 01:10:12,454
In return, of course, for um

1080
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:14,382
a little information.

1081
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:23,990
You want me to

1082
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:26,500
dish the dirty?

1083
01:10:26,704 --> 01:10:28,400
In a manner of speaking.

1084
01:10:35,104 --> 01:10:37,080
What would you like me to say?

1085
01:10:37,084 --> 01:10:38,870
Anything really.

1086
01:10:40,309 --> 01:10:42,020
Well, we need details.

1087
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:44,300
What he says.

1088
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:46,400
What he does.

1089
01:10:53,377 --> 01:10:57,030
Abdul does what
everyone else does.

1090
01:10:57,234 --> 01:10:58,600
He uh,

1091
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:02,225
He looks for preferment.

1092
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,605
He curries favor.

1093
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:18,375
He crawls up
the stinking greasy pole

1094
01:11:18,379 --> 01:11:21,605
of the shitty British Empire.

1095
01:11:24,504 --> 01:11:27,420
Making fools of
all of you because

1096
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:29,710
he is a servant.

1097
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,600
An Indian, Muslim servant

1098
01:11:33,604 --> 01:11:36,900
and you are all
quaking in your boots because

1099
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:40,130
he's beating you
at your own game.

1100
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:43,040
No one is quaking in their boots.

1101
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:45,860
We are the most
powerful nation on Earth

1102
01:11:46,164 --> 01:11:48,266
at the height of our influence.

1103
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,340
In that case,

1104
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:52,240
the only way is down.

1105
01:11:54,004 --> 01:11:57,485
So stick your stupid British Empire

1106
01:11:57,489 --> 01:12:03,450
up your stinky royal bottomhole,
Mr Bertie Prince, sir.

1107
01:12:10,715 --> 01:12:14,030
I hope he makes the whole
damn thing come tumbling down.

1108
01:12:24,028 --> 01:12:26,800
I will see to it
that you die here.

1109
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:35,850
He didn't say anything.

1110
01:12:35,954 --> 01:12:38,310
What do you mean,
he didn't say anything?

1111
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:40,160
We did our best with him, but I...

1112
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:41,444
He spoke most intemperate...

1113
01:12:41,448 --> 01:12:43,805
The man is an absolute shit.

1114
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,299
Dr Reid!

1115
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,100
I'm not a fool.

1116
01:12:48,304 --> 01:12:50,560
I know there is some
skulduggery afoot.

1117
01:12:50,564 --> 01:12:52,045
Something's going on here.

1118
01:12:52,049 --> 01:12:53,735
And I'm not going to stand for it.

1119
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:54,739
Dr Reid,

1120
01:12:54,743 --> 01:12:58,825
I asked you to get to the bottom
of Mrs Karim's fertility issues.

1121
01:12:58,829 --> 01:13:00,760
It seems that nothing has been done.

1122
01:13:00,764 --> 01:13:03,786
Oh, well, actually, Your Majesty,

1123
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:07,700
it was impossible to make
a conclusive judgement

1124
01:13:07,704 --> 01:13:09,500
for religious reasons.

1125
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:11,100
Did you examine the Munshi?

1126
01:13:11,104 --> 01:13:12,860
No, Your Majesty.

1127
01:13:12,864 --> 01:13:14,550
Well, examine the Munshi.

1128
01:13:14,554 --> 01:13:15,800
Bertie.

1129
01:13:22,401 --> 01:13:25,205
I did not do seven years at
Edinburgh University

1130
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:27,200
to look at Indian dicks!

1131
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,200
Trousers.

1132
01:13:55,872 --> 01:13:57,220
Eureka!

1133
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,200
He is riddled with the clap!

1134
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:02,780
Well, well.

1135
01:14:03,784 --> 01:14:05,710
Mother, we have to see you.

1136
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:07,955
Alone.

1137
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,470
I'm in the middle of my Urdu lesson.

1138
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:13,835
Mother, we come with
very important news

1139
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:15,645
of a highly personal matter.

1140
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,730
I have nothing to hide from Abdul.

1141
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:20,130
Please, Your Majesty.

1142
01:14:35,063 --> 01:14:36,702
Your Majesty, um,

1143
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:41,410
I'm afraid our news concerns
the Munshi, um

1144
01:14:41,414 --> 01:14:44,050
We have proof beyond any doubt

1145
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:46,310
that Abdul Karim is a

1146
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:50,625
a low-born impostor.

1147
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:52,705
Your Majesty.

1148
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:58,385
The Munshi is from a noble family

1149
01:14:58,389 --> 01:15:00,500
and a long line of teachers.

1150
01:15:00,504 --> 01:15:04,630
No, I'm afraid he was a mere
clerk in a common jail.

1151
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:08,230
My own son has
sent word from India

1152
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:11,865
and has actually spoken
to his immediate superior.

1153
01:15:12,347 --> 01:15:15,760
His family are completely uneducated.

1154
01:15:15,764 --> 01:15:19,430
His father is a lowly apothecary.

1155
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:22,460
The Munshi never even
went to school, Mother.

1156
01:15:22,464 --> 01:15:25,150
The man's a complete fraud.

1157
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:27,320
And here he is,
overlooking the boxes.

1158
01:15:27,324 --> 01:15:29,450
I'm afraid it's true,
Your Majesty.

1159
01:15:29,454 --> 01:15:33,250
Abdul and his father
are completely common.

1160
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:38,162
We have prepared a dossier.

1161
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,340
You despicable toads!

1162
01:15:41,965 --> 01:15:43,230
Racialists!

1163
01:15:43,234 --> 01:15:45,750
Spying, dossier?

1164
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:47,880
Picking on a poor defenceless Indian.

1165
01:15:47,884 --> 01:15:49,760
Of course he doesn't have
qualifications.

1166
01:15:49,764 --> 01:15:52,300
They do things completely
differently out there.

1167
01:15:52,304 --> 01:15:53,910
But don't you see, Ma-mah,

1168
01:15:53,914 --> 01:15:57,165
he's using his position
for his own gain.

1169
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,980
And how does that make him
any different from any of you?

1170
01:16:01,384 --> 01:16:04,770
How <i>dare</i> you look down on Abdul.

1171
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:07,530
How dare you defame his poor father.

1172
01:16:07,934 --> 01:16:10,850
Bertie, I am ashamed
that you are part of all this.

1173
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,195
Abdul is a loyal, wise,
sympathetic human being.

1174
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,020
Who has raised himself
on his own merits.

1175
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:20,000
Bring Abdul in here.

1176
01:16:21,804 --> 01:16:23,790
Bring him in!

1177
01:16:27,028 --> 01:16:29,380
Now I want you to repeat after me.

1178
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,405
I will be courteous to the Munshi.

1179
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:44,680
I-I will be courteous to the Munshi.

1180
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:45,684
You.

1181
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:49,715
I will be courteous to the Munshi.

1182
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:51,190
Bertie, all of you.

1183
01:16:51,194 --> 01:16:54,460
I will be courteous to the Munshi.

1184
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:59,000
- I will be courteous to the Munshi.
- I will be courteous to the Munshi.

1185
01:16:59,004 --> 01:17:00,545
It has become apparent

1186
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,255
that in order to get
any respect from the Household

1187
01:17:04,259 --> 01:17:06,845
one needs to be formally recognised.

1188
01:17:08,573 --> 01:17:10,070
In which case, Abdul

1189
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:15,300
I intend to give you a knighthood
in the next honours list.

1190
01:17:15,304 --> 01:17:17,605
Enough! This is absurd.

1191
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,300
We cannot protect you
from this any further.

1192
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:22,576
The man is riddled with gonorrhoea.

1193
01:17:25,855 --> 01:17:27,485
Gonorrhoea?

1194
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:30,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

1195
01:17:36,813 --> 01:17:40,515
Well, you are a doctor.
Why don't you treat him?

1196
01:17:40,519 --> 01:17:42,875
Now get out of my sight!
All of you.

1197
01:17:50,519 --> 01:17:53,670
Listen, you pox-ridden
Indian shit!

1198
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:56,325
Why don't you bloody well
leave her alone!

1199
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:59,280
Dr Reid!
Be courteous!

1200
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,790
Knighted?!

1201
01:18:10,794 --> 01:18:13,300
Surely there is some law against it.

1202
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,125
The man's a common Indian,
for God's sake.

1203
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,115
She can't just do what she likes.

1204
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:20,633
That's right. <i>We</i> are the ones
who make this palace work.

1205
01:18:20,637 --> 01:18:23,772
And we are being
ignored and exploited.

1206
01:18:23,776 --> 01:18:26,775
We have to stand up
to this wanton bullying.

1207
01:18:26,779 --> 01:18:28,175
But she's the Queen.

1208
01:18:28,689 --> 01:18:30,775
She's <i>our</i> sovereign.

1209
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:32,162
Her position is based entirely

1210
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,251
on the <i>implicit</i> contract
she makes with us.

1211
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:38,970
If she does not drop
this preposterous insult,

1212
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:41,000
we should all leave!

1213
01:18:41,004 --> 01:18:42,004
Hear!

1214
01:18:43,023 --> 01:18:45,911
Somebody has to tell her.

1215
01:18:47,544 --> 01:18:50,363
We should make a deputation.

1216
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:54,260
I think you should go.

1217
01:18:54,264 --> 01:18:56,055
You're the head of the Household.

1218
01:18:56,059 --> 01:18:57,984
Well, no, I couldn't possibly go.

1219
01:18:57,988 --> 01:19:00,252
It would bring the
position into disrepute.

1220
01:19:00,956 --> 01:19:02,640
Mrs Tuck.

1221
01:19:04,098 --> 01:19:06,075
You know her very well,
don't you?

1222
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,062
But I'm just her dresser.

1223
01:19:08,066 --> 01:19:10,326
What about you, Miss Phipps?

1224
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,742
Off you go.

1225
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:33,450
And don't take no
for an answer.

1226
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:45,930
Your Majesty.

1227
01:19:47,134 --> 01:19:49,180
Out with it, girl.

1228
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,536
Can't you see I'm busy?

1229
01:19:51,882 --> 01:19:54,726
There is something
I must say that uh...

1230
01:19:58,185 --> 01:20:00,730
What is the meaning of this?
Stop shaking.

1231
01:20:01,754 --> 01:20:05,800
I've come to ask you to
reconsider the uh...

1232
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,114
the elevation of

1233
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:11,870
of Mr Karim.

1234
01:20:13,774 --> 01:20:15,374
What did you say?

1235
01:20:18,219 --> 01:20:20,362
I've come to ask you
not to give Mr Karim

1236
01:20:20,366 --> 01:20:22,100
a knighthood, Your Majesty.

1237
01:20:24,013 --> 01:20:25,540
Why the devil not?

1238
01:20:26,562 --> 01:20:28,530
The members of the Household

1239
01:20:28,534 --> 01:20:31,777
demand that you abandon
your plans, Your Majesty.

1240
01:20:32,981 --> 01:20:34,300
Demand?

1241
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:40,215
We believe that it degrades
the very concept of knighthood.

1242
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:44,300
He comes from a very low family,
Your Majesty.

1243
01:20:44,704 --> 01:20:46,375
And

1244
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:49,000
he is coloured.

1245
01:20:49,904 --> 01:20:51,600
Get out of my sight.

1246
01:20:57,446 --> 01:20:58,600
Did you not hear me?

1247
01:20:59,775 --> 01:21:02,286
Your Majesty, I must inform you
that if you refuse

1248
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:06,000
the entire Household will resign.

1249
01:21:06,704 --> 01:21:08,350
Treason!

1250
01:21:09,254 --> 01:21:10,930
Treason!

1251
01:21:15,985 --> 01:21:17,504
Treason.

1252
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:46,250
Mummy.
Enough is enough.

1253
01:21:47,757 --> 01:21:52,830
You will drop this
Munshi business forthwith.

1254
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:54,220
Do you hear me?!

1255
01:21:56,883 --> 01:21:58,544
Did you really think the

1256
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:01,260
the Household would
countenance such an insult?

1257
01:22:01,264 --> 01:22:02,600
I will not be disobeyed.

1258
01:22:02,604 --> 01:22:04,300
No. No.

1259
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:07,310
I have put up with you
for over fifty years!

1260
01:22:07,314 --> 01:22:10,733
You will drop this forthwith, or...

1261
01:22:10,737 --> 01:22:13,040
- Or, or, or, Bertie?
- Or...

1262
01:22:13,044 --> 01:22:16,910
We will have you
certified insane.

1263
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:23,177
And removed from office
immediately.

1264
01:22:25,454 --> 01:22:28,995
Here are the papers
signed by Dr Reid.

1265
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:48,470
I'm eighty-one years of age.

1266
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:51,951
I've had nine children,

1267
01:22:51,955 --> 01:22:54,140
and forty-two grandchildren,

1268
01:22:54,144 --> 01:22:57,500
and have almost
a billion citizens.

1269
01:23:00,187 --> 01:23:02,136
I have rheumatism,

1270
01:23:02,849 --> 01:23:04,544
a collapsed uterus,

1271
01:23:04,548 --> 01:23:06,483
am morbidly obese,

1272
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:10,000
and deaf in one ear.

1273
01:23:12,396 --> 01:23:15,373
I have known eleven
prime ministers,

1274
01:23:15,377 --> 01:23:20,150
and passed 2,347
pieces of legislation.

1275
01:23:22,341 --> 01:23:26,430
I have been in office
sixty-two years, 234 days.

1276
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:29,950
Thus I am the longest-serving
monarch in world history.

1277
01:23:32,651 --> 01:23:36,330
I'm responsible for five Households.

1278
01:23:36,334 --> 01:23:39,680
And a staff of over
three thousand.

1279
01:23:42,513 --> 01:23:44,962
I am cantankerous,

1280
01:23:46,102 --> 01:23:47,220
boring,

1281
01:23:47,224 --> 01:23:48,224
greedy,

1282
01:23:48,228 --> 01:23:49,228
fat,

1283
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:50,658
ill-tempered,

1284
01:23:51,355 --> 01:23:53,216
at times selfish and myopic,

1285
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:55,730
both metaphorically
and literally.

1286
01:23:57,544 --> 01:23:58,913
I am, perhaps,

1287
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:02,372
disagreeably attached to power

1288
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,730
and should not have smashed

1289
01:24:05,734 --> 01:24:08,366
the Emperor of Russia's egg.

1290
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:14,600
But I am anything but insane.

1291
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,080
If the Household wish
to disobey me, so be it.

1292
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:24,900
Let them do it to my face.

1293
01:24:25,275 --> 01:24:28,400
I will see everyone
in the Durbar Room at once.

1294
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,600
Her Majesty, the Queen.

1295
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:08,395
I understand

1296
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,950
there is some concern over
my desires on preferment.

1297
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:17,800
I understand feelings have run high

1298
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:21,122
and I understand
you have decided to resign

1299
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:24,180
rather than withstand my decision.

1300
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:27,576
If any one of you

1301
01:25:28,266 --> 01:25:31,742
wishes to tender their resignation

1302
01:25:31,746 --> 01:25:34,083
it will be accepted

1303
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:39,100
without any
unfortunate consequences.

1304
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:46,100
But at least have the decency
to do it to my face!

1305
01:25:51,174 --> 01:25:54,285
Anyone wishing to resign,
please step forward.

1306
01:26:15,089 --> 01:26:16,300
Hmm.

1307
01:26:20,496 --> 01:26:23,030
I would like to inform you
that I have decided

1308
01:26:23,034 --> 01:26:27,999
against awarding any knighthoods
at this moment.

1309
01:26:32,422 --> 01:26:35,900
Instead, you'll be delighted to know

1310
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,980
that I have decided

1311
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:39,474
to make the Munshi

1312
01:26:39,478 --> 01:26:42,264
a Commander of the
Royal Victorian Order

1313
01:26:43,468 --> 01:26:46,296
as a special token
of my personal esteem

1314
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:50,390
for his services to the Empire.

1315
01:26:53,094 --> 01:26:54,582
That is all.

1316
01:27:16,503 --> 01:27:18,274
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

1317
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,575
Are you all right?

1318
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:24,227
Dr Reid!

1319
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:26,578
Dr Reid!

1320
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:28,535
- Dr Reid!
- Shh, shh, shh.

1321
01:27:28,539 --> 01:27:29,776
- Dr Reid, you must come quick!
- Not now.

1322
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,211
Dr Reid!
It's Mr Mohammed!

1323
01:27:32,215 --> 01:27:33,071
Get that boy!

1324
01:27:33,075 --> 01:27:34,999
Your Majesty,
can you hear me?

1325
01:27:35,003 --> 01:27:36,312
Your Majesty?

1326
01:28:15,635 --> 01:28:19,000
I am sorry, my friend.

1327
01:28:24,316 --> 01:28:26,771
I'm so sorry, Abdul.

1328
01:28:43,075 --> 01:28:46,544
I think it's time
you went home, Abdul.

1329
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:54,100
This <i>is</i> my home.

1330
01:28:54,104 --> 01:28:58,444
I've been short-sighted
and selfish.

1331
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:02,264
You are a young man.

1332
01:29:02,268 --> 01:29:05,100
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

1333
01:29:05,504 --> 01:29:07,000
It's not safe here.

1334
01:29:07,004 --> 01:29:07,804
Your Majesty...

1335
01:29:07,808 --> 01:29:10,600
The vultures are already circling.

1336
01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:13,856
How can I protect you
if I'm not here?

1337
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:17,400
Your Majesty, you will reign
for many years to come.

1338
01:29:17,404 --> 01:29:18,404
No, Abdul.

1339
01:29:18,408 --> 01:29:20,192
I'm sick.

1340
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:25,408
All these stupid ceremonies
will kill me.

1341
01:29:27,006 --> 01:29:28,982
You have been
a very good friend.

1342
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:30,720
But you must leave me.

1343
01:29:32,324 --> 01:29:33,854
I'm your servant.

1344
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:39,012
And as long as I shall live

1345
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,630
I shall be by your side

1346
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:44,300
every single day.

1347
01:29:44,404 --> 01:29:45,542
Nothing.

1348
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,664
Nothing will stop me.

1349
01:29:47,668 --> 01:29:49,550
Abdul, I am your Queen.

1350
01:29:49,554 --> 01:29:52,054
Your Majesty,
I am your Munshi.

1351
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:53,888
And I will never leave you.

1352
01:29:53,892 --> 01:29:56,200
You are a fool.

1353
01:29:57,586 --> 01:29:59,260
But I adore you.

1354
01:31:41,619 --> 01:31:43,864
I think you should
inform the Kaiser.

1355
01:31:59,868 --> 01:32:00,967
Abdul...

1356
01:32:00,971 --> 01:32:02,800
- Abdul...
- It's me, Mummy.

1357
01:32:02,804 --> 01:32:05,154
And your grandson, Wilhelm.

1358
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:06,777
Where is my Munshi?

1359
01:32:06,781 --> 01:32:09,572
- The Kaiser.
- I need my Munshi.

1360
01:32:09,576 --> 01:32:11,954
Hush, hush.
Everything will be all right.

1361
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,764
I want my Munshi.

1362
01:32:24,368 --> 01:32:27,099
Don't you dare upset her.

1363
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:04,936
I want to talk
to the Munshi alone.

1364
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:08,000
I-I think perhaps Your Majesty...

1365
01:33:08,004 --> 01:33:09,713
I said alone.

1366
01:33:32,317 --> 01:33:33,900
When I was young

1367
01:33:35,904 --> 01:33:38,523
I used to long for death.

1368
01:33:40,022 --> 01:33:44,280
Now when there
is nothing to live for

1369
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:48,583
I cling to life with every breath.

1370
01:33:51,262 --> 01:33:53,450
I am scared, Abdul.

1371
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:56,582
Don't be scared.

1372
01:34:02,245 --> 01:34:04,911
'Listen, little drop

1373
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:08,485
'give yourself up
without regret

1374
01:34:09,495 --> 01:34:12,084
'And in return
you will gain the ocean

1375
01:34:13,793 --> 01:34:16,074
'Give yourself away

1376
01:34:16,078 --> 01:34:19,840
'And in the Great Sea
you will be secure.'

1377
01:34:21,444 --> 01:34:23,150
Rumi.

1378
01:34:25,042 --> 01:34:27,900
You are a teacher, Abdul.

1379
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:31,210
Everybody knows Rumi.

1380
01:34:33,314 --> 01:34:35,081
Allah is the teacher.

1381
01:34:39,985 --> 01:34:41,513
Love is the whole.

1382
01:34:42,817 --> 01:34:45,500
We are only pieces.

1383
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:10,500
I keep thinking

1384
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,420
I'm falling.

1385
01:35:16,124 --> 01:35:17,911
Fall.

1386
01:35:21,433 --> 01:35:23,820
All will be well.

1387
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:32,100
You are about to go
to a much safer place.

1388
01:35:35,966 --> 01:35:40,524
To the Banquet Hall of Eternity.

1389
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:49,930
Yes.

1390
01:35:55,934 --> 01:35:57,634
Goodbye,

1391
01:36:00,537 --> 01:36:02,308
my Queen.

1392
01:36:06,812 --> 01:36:08,900
Goodbye.

1393
01:36:10,404 --> 01:36:12,530
Take care,

1394
01:36:14,228 --> 01:36:19,290
my sweet son.

1395
01:36:32,374 --> 01:36:34,100
Let her sleep.

1396
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,440
I grieve to say

1397
01:38:58,444 --> 01:39:02,410
Her Majesty passed away
at six-thirty precisely.

1398
01:39:02,814 --> 01:39:06,166
Long live the King.

1399
01:40:15,555 --> 01:40:19,100
We belong to Allah.
To Allah we return.

1400
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:52,610
Get out of the way!

1401
01:41:04,201 --> 01:41:08,500
I want every last thing
that's connected to her.

1402
01:41:09,804 --> 01:41:11,804
Abdul!

1403
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:23,308
Abdul, they are burning everything.

1404
01:41:27,608 --> 01:41:29,277
I want you out of here.

1405
01:41:31,481 --> 01:41:33,100
Immediately.

1406
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:51,950
No! Your Majesty!

1407
01:41:53,954 --> 01:41:55,434
Come, my dear.

1408
01:41:56,138 --> 01:41:57,500
Take it.

1409
01:41:58,404 --> 01:41:59,980
Keep it safe.

1410
01:43:44,962 --> 01:43:47,000
Good morning, Your Majesty.

1411
01:43:47,004 --> 01:43:49,000
How are you today?

1412
01:44:07,538 --> 01:44:13,000
ABDUL RETURNED TO AGRA IN 1901

1413
01:44:15,688 --> 01:44:22,000
HE DIED IN 1909

1414
01:44:25,255 --> 01:44:33,700
INDIA GAINED INDEPENDENCE IN 1947

1415
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:41,000
HIS PERSONAL DIARY
WAS DISCOVERED IN 2010

1416
01:44:41,104 --> 01:44:44,787
HIS STORY IS FINALLY TOLD
