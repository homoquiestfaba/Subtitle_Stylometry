Bather

6
00:02:53,231-->00:02:54,793
What's that?

7
00:02:54,794-->00:02:58,017
Turbokit a GT35,
XMotor an intercooler ...

8
00:02:58,047-->00:03:01,427
XCS and an exhaust system.
- Nice.

9
00:03:08,382-->00:03:10,846
Look, it's the ESX car.

10
00:03:15,506-->00:03:18,320
He does everything legally,
sponsors and all the trimmings.

11
00:03:19,260-->00:03:20,822
What's next, Krueger?

12
00:03:20,823-->00:03:23,127
I want the first gemporteerde
race driver in Topfuel.

13
00:03:24,576-->00:03:27,942
I can now better your autograph and
EBay to sell when you become famous.

14
00:03:29,824-->00:03:32,118
Come on, you know you're not
here should be that.

15
00:03:32,120-->00:03:34,409
Quiet, Mikey. I'm here
but a visit.

16
00:03:34,864-->00:03:38,205
If ESX find out that you just
are visiting, you can leave.

17
00:03:38,582-->00:03:41,947
Look who show up here.
Will you show respect for your king?

18
00:03:43,238-->00:03:46,103
Tony, if I beat you again, you
a complaint against abuse.

19
00:03:47,583-->00:03:50,883
Nobody beats my new material
more. You're not a big man anymore.

20
00:03:50,884-->00:03:52,579
Do not listen to him, you know
he is challenging you.

21
00:03:53,073-->00:03:55,988
I will come back with my slow
car, is it fair.

22
00:03:58,911-->00:04:00,854
You know what?
It does not matter what you drive.

23
00:04:01,344-->00:04:03,871
Come forward or shut up.

24
00:04:05,723-->00:04:08,037
Not tonight.
- Yes, forget it.

25
00:04:08,712-->00:04:11,370
What now?
Come show off what you just now?

26
00:04:11,891-->00:04:16,452
Go ahead. Stand there like a sissy
and show it next to show car.

27
00:04:18,442-->00:04:24,129
Say what you want, Krueger. But if
I went to the ring, I get to boxing.

28
00:04:28,242-->00:04:29,805
Okay, come on over.

29
00:04:30,952-->00:04:32,515
Let's go.

30
00:04:36,339-->00:04:39,220
Walk away from it.
- I let this kid not to embarrass myself.

31
00:04:39,221-->00:04:41,574
Who cares what they think?
They just want to see a race.

32
00:04:45,270-->00:04:50,552
Attention all units, we have called
of an illegal street race in downtown.

33
00:05:11,821-->00:05:14,454
I just heard on the scanner, they come.
- Start the race.

34
00:05:14,455-->00:05:16,018
I do not, this is stupid.

35
00:05:16,234-->00:05:18,485
Just do it.
It's over within 10 seconds.

36
00:06:17,571-->00:06:19,226
Are you okay?
- Yes.

37
00:06:19,227-->00:06:21,195
Well, put your hands up.
You're under arrest.

38
00:06:29,735-->00:06:35,005
I left you only race for them because I
thought you would stay out of trouble.

39
00:06:35,006-->00:06:38,387
You finally do something productive.
I've had enough.

40
00:06:44,157-->00:06:47,309
My goodness.
How bad is it this time?

41
00:07:05,078-->00:07:07,092
I do not think we should do.

42
00:07:19,951-->00:07:21,863
Mr. Ashtar.

43
00:07:21,864-->00:07:26,545
I'm so sorry, I can explain ...
- What part do you explain?

44
00:07:27,945-->00:07:31,071
The part where you have a car of $ 100,000
bring to an illegal street race?

45
00:07:31,072-->00:07:33,365
Or how you managed to get
against a police car to crash?

46
00:07:33,366-->00:07:36,354
You are lucky that no one
injured. - I know, I made a mistake ...

47
00:07:36,355-->00:07:40,015
What you did was stupid.
This is a disaster.

48
00:07:40,455-->00:07:42,018
You're done, Krueger.

49
00:07:42,054-->00:07:43,860
I will repay ...
- You're done.

50
00:07:43,861-->00:07:46,935
Come on, Danny. We go.
Sorry, Mr.. Ashtar.

51
00:08:03,844-->00:08:08,738
I had to listen to you.
- You're like a bull ...

52
00:08:09,299-->00:08:10,861
if you see red, go for it.

53
00:08:11,558-->00:08:13,120
No matter what anyone says.

54
00:08:13,747-->00:08:15,310
Yes.

55
00:08:16,389-->00:08:18,730
Keep your head up,
it'll be fine.

56
00:08:28,169-->00:08:29,732
What?

57
00:08:33,904-->00:08:37,488
We're trying to help
really, it just ...

58
00:08:38,317-->00:08:41,895
We will send you to your father to live there.
- What?

59
00:08:41,897-->00:08:44,363
You need a clean slate
this all behind you.

60
00:08:44,364-->00:08:46,357
When did you talk to him?
- This morning.

61
00:08:47,770-->00:08:49,576
He set up for this, right?

62
00:08:49,577-->00:08:52,113
No, Joe has nothing to do.

63
00:08:52,114-->00:08:54,614
Every time there is a problem,
it is worse than the last.

64
00:08:54,616-->00:08:57,534
Fines speed, street racing
and now an accident.

65
00:08:57,535-->00:09:00,105
I would not even think about it
what next is going to be.

66
00:09:00,106-->00:09:03,515
So you will send me to a guy
I have not seen in five years?

67
00:09:03,894-->00:09:06,500
He is a drunkard.
- No, Danny, he's not drunk.

68
00:09:06,501-->00:09:08,064
Yes, no more.

69
00:09:08,899-->00:09:12,743
I did everything I could think of
and I do not know what else to do.

70
00:09:14,146-->00:09:18,281
I'm not.
My whole life is here.

71
00:09:18,282-->00:09:20,748
There is no ...
- No, you have no choice.

72
00:09:20,749-->00:09:23,184
You go. End of story.

73
00:10:25,144-->00:10:28,779
Hi, Lisa.
- Hello, Frank.

74
00:10:31,469-->00:10:34,752
You look good.
- You too.

75
00:10:50,687-->00:10:53,604
Hello, boy.
- Hello, Frank.

76
00:11:00,314-->00:11:03,065
Do you want to load or not?

77
00:11:59,983-->00:12:05,420
Nice car you got there. And in 2003?
- 2004.

78
00:12:07,733-->00:12:10,581
Converted itself?
- Me and my friend Mikey.

79
00:12:10,582-->00:12:13,071
Beautiful, it looks expensive.

80
00:12:14,058-->00:12:16,106
What a guy, who stepfather of yours.

81
00:12:16,107-->00:12:17,670
I bought it myself.

82
00:12:19,201-->00:12:21,381
We can chitchat
keep to a minimum?

83
00:12:26,463-->00:12:31,402
That's your plan, ignoring me.
- Until I'm 18, yes.

84
00:12:38,487-->00:12:41,058
Why wait, tough guy?
Come on.

85
00:12:42,275-->00:12:44,830
Get out.
Go hiking.

86
00:12:46,411-->00:12:48,701
You can catch me so much
if you want, but ...

87
00:12:48,703-->00:12:50,784
does not change that we
bragged to each other down.

88
00:12:51,416-->00:12:52,978
Do you understand?

89
00:12:58,018-->00:13:01,388
I'm not a popularity contest
win or your best friend ...

90
00:13:01,389-->00:13:06,814
or lost time. I am here because
your mother no more.

91
00:13:06,950-->00:13:09,379
Do you understand?
Got it?

92
00:13:16,680-->00:13:21,022
Done with it.
- Yes? What about me?

93
00:13:22,415-->00:13:23,977
What about you?

94
00:14:07,939-->00:14:09,501
So this is home.

95
00:14:27,470-->00:14:30,416
Do you have that thing?
- Yes.

96
00:14:31,119-->00:14:33,395
I bet it's bad driving.

97
00:14:44,568-->00:14:48,658
Well, my humble stulpje.

98
00:14:51,484-->00:14:54,606
So, now that you live with me ...

99
00:14:54,608-->00:14:59,059
there are a few rules to follow.
There is no girl, well after yourself.

100
00:14:59,060-->00:15:03,153
You make your own food, you do your
own dishes, you can do your laundry there.

101
00:15:04,655-->00:15:06,217
Your room.

102
00:15:13,134-->00:15:14,696
Any questions?

103
00:15:15,185-->00:15:18,311
We can now unload my car? - Why
in such a hurry? You should not be driving.

104
00:15:18,312-->00:15:21,104
My license has limitations,
I may ride to school and work.

105
00:15:22,379-->00:15:26,169
And nowhere else, right?
Ok.

106
00:15:26,339-->00:15:27,902
Pack your stuff out.

107
00:15:55,740-->00:15:57,554
I take it this is about.

108
00:15:59,389-->00:16:04,223
What does it need?
- I work on a turbo upgrade, nothing special.

109
00:16:04,880-->00:16:09,145
So you think you know anything about engines?
- Probably better than you.

110
00:16:11,969-->00:16:16,103
Fantastic, I always wanted half
mechanic, but I could never pay.

111
00:16:16,104-->00:16:20,912
You go to your expertise
show every day after school.

112
00:16:21,074-->00:16:22,834
No free rides.

113
00:17:00,518-->00:17:02,393
Okay, look after the fuel cards.

114
00:17:02,394-->00:17:06,424
If the air-fuel ratio somewhere
comes close to 11.5 / 1, we work it out.

115
00:17:06,425-->00:17:09,031
That is not cool, we would
The rich have to test.

116
00:17:09,032-->00:17:11,220
Dude, I want a 12.5 / 1.

117
00:17:11,221-->00:17:14,669
Ok, if the pistons will give,
is it for you. - Whatever.

118
00:17:20,292-->00:17:23,366
Also check the DGT.
- Yes, master.

119
00:17:25,331-->00:17:26,893
You'll see, baby.

120
00:17:28,458-->00:17:31,237
H Max, how does the schrootbak?

121
00:17:31,238-->00:17:33,972
Pretty good, we have
worked there all summer.

122
00:17:34,678-->00:17:36,929
Want to see whether all the hard work yields something?

123
00:17:39,926-->00:17:43,400
Yes.
- It's much faster with the turbo.

124
00:17:43,401-->00:17:45,515
We leave him a poopy smell.

125
00:17:47,050-->00:17:49,450
We can not do this, please.

126
00:17:50,804-->00:17:52,366
Jake, do not.

127
00:18:00,152-->00:18:01,714
Jake, stop.

128
00:18:03,766-->00:18:05,328
Ok, we got it.

129
00:18:18,083-->00:18:20,987
Keep it up.
- Jake.

130
00:18:26,077-->00:18:27,639
You're such an idiot.

131
00:18:32,679-->00:18:36,745
Come on.

132
00:18:41,820-->00:18:43,973
Shake and bake, baby.

133
00:18:56,103-->00:18:58,778
What's wrong with you?
They could get hurt.

134
00:18:58,779-->00:19:00,341
All is well with them.

135
00:19:58,483-->00:20:01,046
Come on.
Are you still mad?

136
00:20:59,576-->00:21:02,771
Quite a price, h?
- Yes.

137
00:21:02,773-->00:21:05,120
The best school there is.

138
00:21:05,449-->00:21:08,229
All race teams look for their new pilots there.

139
00:21:08,230-->00:21:10,522
You need a fast car
have to win it.

140
00:21:10,523-->00:21:13,278
I have covered.
- That sounds familiar.

141
00:21:13,721-->00:21:16,631
Are you here?
- No.

142
00:21:19,176-->00:21:23,763
Another thing to hope for.
- It's cruel that they hang the posters there.

143
00:21:23,764-->00:21:28,072
Let them think they have a chance.
- Max H, exciting race this morning.

144
00:21:45,831-->00:21:49,968
I am Mr. Briggs, I'm going
now say this ...

145
00:21:49,986-->00:21:53,821
No lesson is that you do not
just to succeed.

146
00:21:53,824-->00:21:58,292
I give a serious lesson.
Jake.

147
00:21:59,384-->00:22:01,364
I'm talking to you.
- Against me?

148
00:22:01,365-->00:22:04,596
Yeah, you.
It does not matter who I think you are ...

149
00:22:04,597-->00:22:08,558
but in my teaching, you
carefully and do it.

150
00:22:08,559-->00:22:10,800
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

151
00:22:12,048-->00:22:14,465
Ok.
Now you are in a good mood, you Jake ...

152
00:22:14,466-->00:22:18,391
Why do you tell the class is not
what a variable magnetic field?

153
00:22:19,610-->00:22:21,317
What did you say?

154
00:22:23,607-->00:22:27,187
You.
Explain.

155
00:22:28,298-->00:22:31,884
Well, it varies
time of the intake ...

156
00:22:31,887-->00:22:35,099
using energy-coupling
the camshaft to rotate.

157
00:22:35,527-->00:22:39,120
I am not aware
of the import tuning magazine.

158
00:22:41,330-->00:22:43,411
Actually, the variable CTH
Timing is used ...

159
00:22:43,413-->00:22:45,806
in domestic vehicles,
like the new Mustang.

160
00:22:46,126-->00:22:47,953
Drive a car you not?

161
00:22:51,061-->00:22:53,742
Not bad.
What is your name?

162
00:22:54,049-->00:22:55,611
Danny.

163
00:22:55,612-->00:22:59,124
Do you have a last name, Danny?
- Krueger.

164
00:23:00,687-->00:23:04,057
Are you Frank's son?
He said you were coming.

165
00:23:04,058-->00:23:06,316
He also said that you have a bad
attendance file.

166
00:23:06,317-->00:23:08,385
I'm still no problems
have with you ...

167
00:23:08,387-->00:23:09,949
Danny?
- No.

168
00:23:10,417-->00:23:11,980
Well.

169
00:23:13,093-->00:23:19,264
Frank Krueger's your father? Another reason
not to step on the racetrack to set.

170
00:23:30,365-->00:23:32,553
How do I register for the race?

171
00:23:32,936-->00:23:34,552
Already 18?

172
00:23:38,254-->00:23:42,857
Let your dad drawing and bring it back to me.
At the latest within two weeks.

173
00:23:44,578-->00:23:46,140
Danny ...

174
00:23:48,470-->00:23:53,599
Ignore them.
Your father was a great race driver.

175
00:24:04,387-->00:24:09,425
Ok, for all the new faces,
I want to welcome you into the drama class.

176
00:24:09,426-->00:24:11,163
I am Ms.. Parker.

177
00:24:11,164-->00:24:15,992
I would like to start each new class
an exercise which I call "first impression" call.

178
00:24:16,273-->00:24:18,467
So, how many of you want first?

179
00:24:21,381-->00:24:24,351
Ok. You, in the back.

180
00:24:25,412-->00:24:28,608
What is your name?
- Danny.

181
00:24:28,609-->00:24:36,253
Danny, come stand over here. Who wants
their first impression of Danny?

182
00:24:36,254-->00:24:41,133
Jessica.
You seem a lot to say today.

183
00:24:42,023-->00:24:44,204
Why not say what you see?

184
00:24:46,923-->00:24:51,210
He's definitely a transition student.
- Okay, interesting. Go on.

185
00:24:52,797-->00:24:55,645
Probably only in the drama lesson
because that was all that was still free.

186
00:24:55,646-->00:24:59,760
Why do you say?
- He does not seem like Shakespeare-type.

187
00:24:59,920-->00:25:03,845
Do not you, Ms. Popularity,
with your $ 400 jeans.

188
00:25:04,265-->00:25:05,135
Name one character from n
of his plays?

189
00:25:05,136-->00:25:08,052
I can not even mention two,
Romeo and Juliet.

190
00:25:08,053-->00:25:13,046
Please, everyone knows that.
- You said "any character". Your turn.

191
00:25:14,030-->00:25:17,854
This is difficult, there are so many good.

192
00:25:18,062-->00:25:22,083
Like Macbeth, Shila, Mr.. Mona,
Affello and Hamlet.

193
00:25:22,475-->00:25:28,207
Your turn.
- Are they all characters?

194
00:25:29,356-->00:25:30,918
You did well.

195
00:25:35,403-->00:25:38,164
Pock.
- Excuse me?

196
00:25:38,495-->00:25:40,924
Pock, A Midsummer Night's Dream?

197
00:25:41,727-->00:25:43,892
The mischief maker, the night elf.

198
00:25:44,126-->00:25:46,939
Someone googled Shakespeare after class.

199
00:25:48,539-->00:25:51,882
How did you know I stuck
Sat with drama class?

200
00:25:51,883-->00:25:53,820
It happened to me
when I was transferred.

201
00:25:53,821-->00:25:55,407
You were also transferred?

202
00:25:55,558-->00:25:57,744
When was that?
- Last year, from Tampa.

203
00:25:57,817-->00:25:59,979
And you?
- Insino.

204
00:26:00,181-->00:26:02,299
A valley-boy, h?
- Yes.

205
00:26:02,300-->00:26:04,868
So a huge culture shock Bradford?

206
00:26:07,861-->00:26:09,961
It sucks here.

207
00:26:12,205-->00:26:13,810
Things are getting better.

208
00:26:13,978-->00:26:15,540
I hope so.

209
00:26:16,862-->00:26:21,119
I like a "back to school
party "tonight. You should come.

210
00:26:22,491-->00:26:24,053
I do not know.

211
00:26:24,890-->00:26:27,035
Not a social type?

212
00:26:28,017-->00:26:32,610
Here's the address.
In case you could get bored.

213
00:26:50,953-->00:26:55,836
You're late. I have 3 cars that have a turn
needed 15 minutes ago.

214
00:27:10,831-->00:27:13,124
Faster, you must still
two do next.

215
00:27:13,125-->00:27:15,140
I'm not used to
working with antiques.

216
00:27:16,048-->00:27:20,561
Antiques.
Do you know the world is?

217
00:27:20,562-->00:27:23,387
What I know are programmable
engine management systems ...

218
00:27:23,388-->00:27:25,579
no carbs and mechanical inflammation.

219
00:27:25,601-->00:27:28,214
Try the fuel valve once,
that will help.

220
00:27:45,235-->00:27:49,302
Where do you keep this stupid thing?
- I do not know, I've never needed.

221
00:27:57,017-->00:27:58,579
Write it down.

222
00:28:11,995-->00:28:15,122
I'm just in the restaurant,
do you want to go?

223
00:28:15,123-->00:28:16,685
I already ate.

224
00:28:20,440-->00:28:22,002
Or not.

225
00:28:53,002-->00:28:54,564
H, Danny.

226
00:28:59,849-->00:29:04,643
Now I know where I know you.
- Put that away, that's history.

227
00:29:04,644-->00:29:07,559
History is our favorite subject.

228
00:29:07,807-->00:29:12,401
I'm Max, this is Harry.
What does a superstar like you in Bradford?

229
00:29:14,270-->00:29:16,158
Do you know the girl who gives this party?

230
00:29:16,159-->00:29:17,721
Yeah, sure.
- A little.

231
00:29:20,630-->00:29:24,554
Do you mind if we go with you?
- No.

232
00:29:28,310-->00:29:33,193
There's the pool.
I had to bring a swimsuit.

233
00:29:33,557-->00:29:36,018
Let's go get some beer.
Would you also one?

234
00:29:36,720-->00:29:38,283
No, thank you.

235
00:29:46,486-->00:29:51,801
Nice turnout, Jessica.
Where's Jake?

236
00:29:51,802-->00:29:55,728
Come on, Rachel. We have been the worst
dates had, I've had enough.

237
00:29:55,729-->00:29:57,779
Yes, but look what he has
done for you ...

238
00:29:58,854-->00:29:59,966
social life. This feast
belongs to the top.

239
00:30:00,629-->00:30:04,570
My God, that's the boy
the drama class. Danny Krueger.

240
00:30:04,869-->00:30:08,599
And?
- Have you invited him?

241
00:30:08,726-->00:30:12,011
I thought it would be a good opportunity
for him to get to know new people.

242
00:30:12,376-->00:30:16,182
Well, he has been a good start
continue to raise the nerds.

243
00:30:16,198-->00:30:19,472
Have you invited them?
- They do no harm?

244
00:30:32,323-->00:30:34,720
Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:30:34,721-->00:30:36,383
I did not think you were coming.

246
00:30:36,388-->00:30:38,257
As the hostess me
VIP invitation gave ...

247
00:30:38,258-->00:30:41,809
I thought, I turn over the work
and go there. - And she appreciates that.

248
00:30:41,810-->00:30:44,251
That's good, because my boss is hard.

249
00:31:05,094-->00:31:08,464
It is good to have you here instead
always in that garage of yours.

250
00:31:08,465-->00:31:10,982
It's my turn.
- Frank Krueger, is that you?

251
00:31:11,107-->00:31:15,389
I did not recognize you because you are right.
You know that they serve no whiskey.

252
00:31:16,320-->00:31:18,723
I have been sober since October, Jimmy.

253
00:31:25,007-->00:31:29,039
A new car in your collection?
- What are you talking about?

254
00:31:29,455-->00:31:31,152
I've always had this.

255
00:31:38,039-->00:31:40,321
Now I recognize it, I just
but still ...

256
00:31:40,331-->00:31:42,613
seen in educating
my rearview mirror.

257
00:31:46,414-->00:31:48,066
You're a funny man.

258
00:31:54,963-->00:31:57,707
Jake, you okay?
How are you?

259
00:31:57,708-->00:32:00,557
Can your parents every time
come in and shut down this party?

260
00:32:00,558-->00:32:02,826
Are you kidding? I had never
such a celebration ...

261
00:32:02,828-->00:32:04,909
My stepfather had to
began to fraternize.

262
00:32:05,146-->00:32:07,076
Mine could not wait
to get rid of me.

263
00:32:07,439-->00:32:10,399
Have you seen Jessica somewhere?
- That guy is good at Krueger.

264
00:32:10,984-->00:32:13,555
Is that how you ended up in Bradford?
- Approximately, yes.

265
00:32:13,556-->00:32:16,243
My father lives here.
I do not know why.

266
00:32:16,266-->00:32:22,180
Come on, it's not so bad?
- It gets better.

267
00:32:25,163-->00:32:29,217
Jake.
- What are you doing with this idiot?

268
00:32:29,263-->00:32:32,077
We talk.
- If you leave it at that.

269
00:32:32,078-->00:32:35,239
Do not pretend you're my boyfriend, Jake
Because you're not.

270
00:32:35,240-->00:32:39,027
I know we had a little fight
But we must get to know each other.

271
00:32:39,028-->00:32:43,738
Really? How? The only thing you're talking about,
about yourself and your car.

272
00:32:45,180-->00:32:46,742
What's wrong with that?

273
00:32:48,238-->00:32:52,749
Bitches. They never know what they want.
- Okay, there's no reason to do common.

274
00:32:53,382-->00:32:57,863
Will you do something about it?
- Easy, right? Nobody wants trouble.

275
00:32:57,864-->00:32:59,427
Too late.

276
00:33:04,662-->00:33:06,834
Are you tired of your life?
Want more?

277
00:33:17,951-->00:33:19,513
Is that all you got?

278
00:33:21,704-->00:33:23,266
Come on.

279
00:33:43,841-->00:33:47,610
Danny, stop.
- He is like a superhero.

280
00:34:11,087-->00:34:12,649
Jake, do not.

281
00:34:42,815-->00:34:45,247
Damn.
- He is going down.

282
00:34:45,248-->00:34:46,810
Come on.

283
00:34:52,476-->00:34:54,038
Come on.

284
00:35:40,747-->00:35:42,875
That is,
We have a straight, guys.

285
00:35:49,678-->00:35:52,770
Why do we get him in?
- Because you two idiots sitting in the car.

286
00:35:55,481-->00:35:57,069
No police.

287
00:35:59,269-->00:36:02,901
I'm impressed. You begin at last
your temper under control.

288
00:36:03,648-->00:36:06,815
It is not easy with that
uittest child every day.

289
00:36:06,845-->00:36:10,726
He is as bad as I was.
- You were worse, and you know it.

290
00:36:13,796-->00:36:16,645
He looks like a good boy,
give him some time.

291
00:36:16,923-->00:36:19,458
I only hope that I
can keep out of trouble.

292
00:36:27,453-->00:36:29,573
You do good work so far.

293
00:36:50,737-->00:36:52,299
Out of my way.

294
00:36:54,664-->00:36:57,727
Come on Krueger,
We only want to talk.

295
00:37:03,074-->00:37:04,636
Go.

296
00:37:25,176-->00:37:27,738
Come on.
We got him.

297
00:37:30,598-->00:37:32,160
Here we go.

298
00:37:37,548-->00:37:39,675
Come on, Krueger.
- Come on.

299
00:37:42,969-->00:37:44,696
We got him, boys.

300
00:37:57,531-->00:37:59,310
He is going down.

301
00:38:39,684-->00:38:44,837
You better leave, you'll be late ...
- My car has problems, give you a ride?

302
00:38:45,871-->00:38:47,700
Driving too fast?

303
00:38:51,744-->00:38:53,742
I find my own ride back.

304
00:39:06,722-->00:39:10,563
H guy, is it true that you
Jake's Mustang have preserved?

305
00:39:11,030-->00:39:13,463
What do you have under your hood?

306
00:39:33,272-->00:39:36,249
Krueger, you'd better sit down.

307
00:39:41,960-->00:39:46,430
Ok, we start with a test
on air-fuel ratios.

308
00:39:51,934-->00:39:55,547
Dude, you were faster than Jake.
- That's what everyone at the restaurant said.

309
00:39:55,548-->00:39:57,679
He had two people in his car,
So I had ...

310
00:39:57,683-->00:39:59,450
advantage. I did it
reasonably well, why?

311
00:39:59,451-->00:40:02,705
He is the fastest in the province. Nobody
can beat him in the street races.

312
00:40:02,706-->00:40:06,372
His father is the owner of Kendall Performances
He's got a lot to store his disposal.

313
00:40:06,374-->00:40:08,711
Yes? - Jake's car is
this school on the map.

314
00:40:08,753-->00:40:11,594
Our football team is rotslecht.
- You will participate in the race, right?

315
00:40:11,603-->00:40:13,869
Yes, but I must first have
some work on my car.

316
00:40:15,809-->00:40:17,725
You do not know what you have started.

317
00:40:17,726-->00:40:21,389
Stop it.
There is no fighting in my classroom.

318
00:40:21,786-->00:40:24,016
Not if you want
participate in the race.

319
00:40:24,017-->00:40:26,561
And if you have a problem with each other,
Will you arrange it on the racetrack.

320
00:40:26,685-->00:40:28,644
And stop racing on the street.

321
00:40:29,848-->00:40:32,252
See you after school.

322
00:40:38,536-->00:40:41,530
See you after school?
- Yeah, okay.

323
00:40:46,703-->00:40:48,265
Danny.

324
00:40:54,834-->00:40:57,146
Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:40:57,719-->00:41:00,854
How's the lip?
- Good.

326
00:41:04,461-->00:41:07,481
So, how does it feel to be the most
discussed guy at school?

327
00:41:08,283-->00:41:10,508
I liked it better when
No one knew my name.

328
00:41:12,071-->00:41:13,634
Thanks.

329
00:41:13,774-->00:41:17,339
Well, I liked the way
He did not speak to you ok.

330
00:41:17,612-->00:41:19,918
It was very chivalrous.

331
00:41:20,482-->00:41:23,133
That's something good, right?
- Yes.

332
00:41:25,834-->00:41:27,594
Go out with me.

333
00:41:32,818-->00:41:38,239
I shall think about it.
- But my car is broken, so you should drive.

334
00:41:38,309-->00:41:41,615
The car everyone is talking about?
- Yes, but do not go.

335
00:41:47,936-->00:41:51,549
It's the end of the month.
- You keep kidding, right?

336
00:41:51,550-->00:41:56,398
First prize is a full scholarship to
The NHA racing school, that's what everyone ...

337
00:41:56,399-->00:41:59,542
Yes, I think you temporarily
The racing should stay away.

338
00:41:59,543-->00:42:02,787
I knew you would do about this stupid.
- Watch your language.

339
00:42:03,192-->00:42:07,222
Especially if you ask for favors.
- I have not asked for 7 years.

340
00:42:07,223-->00:42:11,293
All I want is your signature.
- Do you want my autograph?

341
00:42:11,323-->00:42:13,715
Then I best not again
caught in a street race.

342
00:42:14,521-->00:42:19,183
I have not done that.
- Who do you think you have it?

343
00:43:00,880-->00:43:05,278
You keep kidding.
- You are not the only one with a fast car.

344
00:43:12,348-->00:43:16,398
And a gear too.
- What is the use of a Porsche with automatic transmission?

345
00:43:16,518-->00:43:19,675
You make me very hard
about you now not to like.

346
00:43:19,959-->00:43:21,522
Seat belt.

347
00:43:23,225-->00:43:25,929
Where are we?
- To Chuck E 'Cheese.

348
00:43:25,930-->00:43:28,656
Chuck E 'Cheese, which is fun.
- Have you ever been?

349
00:43:28,657-->00:43:30,219
No.

350
00:43:35,250-->00:43:38,518
Who taught you driving?
You're right.

351
00:43:38,621-->00:43:42,295
Not like most girls?
- You said, I do not.

352
00:43:42,860-->00:43:44,855
That is the car where
I learned to drive.

353
00:43:46,127-->00:43:49,384
Mine was an old Honda Civic.
- He's my father.

354
00:43:50,298-->00:43:52,839
The day he came home with it,
he was a small child.

355
00:43:52,840-->00:43:57,281
He saved it for years to purchase,
My mother was so angry.

356
00:43:58,012-->00:44:01,141
She calls it his convertible with my princess.

357
00:44:02,356-->00:44:07,307
I remember the feeling of
doctrine when it was new, and that smell.

358
00:44:07,708-->00:44:10,867
He always said that the Porsche
learn a unique smell.

359
00:44:12,191-->00:44:16,718
And I do not want to leave. So I'm driving
it only on special occasions.

360
00:44:17,543-->00:44:19,625
Or if I have a lot to think.

361
00:44:21,226-->00:44:27,354
How long is he gone?
- Three years.

362
00:44:32,973-->00:44:35,387
I'm sorry.
- For what?

363
00:44:39,367-->00:44:42,358
I heard a rumor that you
father once drove for NASCAR.

364
00:44:42,359-->00:44:45,651
150km per hour until he against a wall
and drove his foot crushed.

365
00:44:46,630-->00:44:48,770
Ouch.
- Yes.

366
00:44:49,341-->00:44:52,954
He was never the same afterwards.
It was like living with a ghost.

367
00:44:52,955-->00:44:57,367
You knew he was there, but did
just as he wants for it.

368
00:44:57,368-->00:45:02,384
But you still closer to him now, right?
- From a geographic standpoint it.

369
00:45:02,616-->00:45:07,967
But, I do not know. It's weird.
- What is it weird?

370
00:45:07,968-->00:45:10,014
Trying to communicate.

371
00:45:11,409-->00:45:18,395
There is too much to say.
- That's not bad, trust me.

372
00:45:22,703-->00:45:25,050
Want a ride to make?
- Yes.

373
00:46:05,344-->00:46:10,710
Good night.
- Good night.

374
00:46:29,843-->00:46:35,015
What is it?
- Can you look at my car?

375
00:46:36,307-->00:46:40,464
Maybe this weekend, I must first
the head gasket replaced urgently.

376
00:46:43,640-->00:46:46,752
Forget it, I go at it myself.

377
00:46:54,413-->00:46:56,202
What is the problem?

378
00:46:56,203-->00:47:01,954
He gets fuel, ignition, pipes
are good, there's nothing broken.

379
00:47:01,955-->00:47:07,170
I do not understand. Normally I would Mickey's
Laptop at release, but that's not now.

380
00:47:15,575-->00:47:16,914
Try it now.

381
00:47:19,521-->00:47:21,647
Start him now but.

382
00:47:28,005-->00:47:31,610
You forgot the crankshaft sensor
turn, so he was not.

383
00:47:31,611-->00:47:34,550
And those links are
definitely loose vibrated.

384
00:47:36,423-->00:47:38,707
I have not even thought of as
control.

385
00:47:39,607-->00:47:41,752
It's a 2.5, right?
- Yes.

386
00:47:41,753-->00:47:47,725
If you link to that little injectors
your turbo, then he is even harder.

387
00:47:47,726-->00:47:52,168
He was certainly in the last red.
- I think he can be even harder.

388
00:47:52,169-->00:47:57,501
Anyway, now that it works,
you need to get parts for me.

389
00:47:57,502-->00:47:58,698
Where to?

390
00:48:02,808-->00:48:07,039
Candles.
- Buy items in the rival?

391
00:48:07,040-->00:48:11,782
Competitors? I am lucky
that the case was still running.

392
00:48:14,794-->00:48:15,827
You're welcome.

393
00:48:18,193-->00:48:19,285
Thanks.

394
00:48:26,969-->00:48:30,074
If your gas pedal,
make sure that nobody sees.

395
00:49:40,806-->00:49:42,642
Are you sure nothing is wrong?

396
00:49:42,852-->00:49:47,015
It is built with 1 / 16 racing gas
and lost 3% of it each time.

397
00:49:47,016-->00:49:48,578
This baby is ready.

398
00:49:48,579-->00:49:51,936
I hope so.
I race against the college boy tonight.

399
00:49:51,937-->00:49:56,159
You beat them well.
Better be, or you get a name.

400
00:50:05,167-->00:50:08,271
H, you. It is still
by at 7:30, right?

401
00:50:10,692-->00:50:14,357
Actually, I do not make it.
I have to work overtime.

402
00:50:17,781-->00:50:22,280
I'm sorry, Jess.
Can we do it tomorrow?

403
00:50:23,655-->00:50:27,163
Yes.
- Thank you, you're wonderful.

404
00:50:27,164-->00:50:30,779
Talk to you later, okay?
- Bye.

405
00:50:56,738-->00:50:58,613
Harder, old man.

406
00:51:05,218-->00:51:09,090
Are you crazy? When Jake and his boys
You see, they destroy you.

407
00:51:09,091-->00:51:11,082
Quiet, I'm just some reconnaissance.

408
00:51:11,542-->00:51:13,105
Ok.

409
00:51:49,353-->00:51:51,332
Come on, Jake.

410
00:51:53,823-->00:51:56,092
You will be defeated, college boy.

411
00:52:21,220-->00:52:24,596
It seems that his college boy
handbrake had forgotten to turn off.

412
00:52:24,835-->00:52:26,397
Too bad.

413
00:52:34,843-->00:52:36,405
Hi, Rachel.

414
00:52:36,512-->00:52:39,707
I thought you and the newcomer
going out tonight?

415
00:52:39,708-->00:52:42,102
Yes, but he canceled
because he had to work late.

416
00:52:42,103-->00:52:45,552
No, he's in street racing.
I'm looking at him.

417
00:52:46,833-->00:52:49,906
He finished in the top 4, so
probably about 120 miles / h.

418
00:52:51,316-->00:52:55,307
If he can beat him on the
racetrack, he must sit around ten.

419
00:52:56,146-->00:52:58,387
Okay, I'll see you later.

420
00:52:58,892-->00:53:00,550
What have we here?

421
00:53:00,733-->00:53:03,623
Do not be shy, Krueger.
Come say days.

422
00:53:07,962-->00:53:11,227
Krueger, I'm glad you stop by.

423
00:53:11,228-->00:53:13,452
I think we are wrong foot.

424
00:53:13,453-->00:53:17,205
I did not know I was in the presence
was a celebrity.

425
00:53:17,206-->00:53:20,541
I did some research and apparently
were you a big man in LA.

426
00:53:20,542-->00:53:24,179
Not that that means much if your opponent
China has a rommelbak.

427
00:53:27,006-->00:53:30,264
But you did get a good sponsor ...

428
00:53:30,265-->00:53:35,616
that surprised me, because I thought ...
This is the son of that loser, Frank Krueger.

429
00:53:35,763-->00:53:37,326
Shut up, Jake.

430
00:53:37,883-->00:53:42,425
And then I found out that you
You sponsor race car driving piece.

431
00:53:42,645-->00:53:45,882
And then I thought, you see,
He is an Krueger.

432
00:53:50,325-->00:53:56,231
And now everybody thinks you are quick.

433
00:53:56,232-->00:53:58,590
Maybe faster than me.

434
00:54:00,194-->00:54:01,889
Let's fix this.

435
00:54:04,121-->00:54:06,194
You did not even close last night.

436
00:54:06,380-->00:54:09,223
I had three people in my car.
- And I did not drive at full speed.

437
00:54:09,334-->00:54:11,205
Let's settle it now.

438
00:54:16,179-->00:54:18,644
You still have a few
hours before the cafés close ...

439
00:54:18,786-->00:54:20,966
your father to the floor there to pick up.

440
00:54:22,922-->00:54:26,915
That's why you moved over here?
Your personal assistant to his father.

441
00:54:29,733-->00:54:33,451
That was low, you're right. I had
Your father should not offend.

442
00:54:33,452-->00:54:35,288
My gardener says
He delivered a good job.

443
00:54:36,648-->00:54:38,414
Would you like racing?

444
00:54:38,838-->00:54:41,231
Come on, let's go.

445
00:54:41,514-->00:54:43,386
Quiet, Danny.

446
00:54:47,804-->00:54:49,854
It appears that Krueger goes down.

447
00:55:21,132-->00:55:22,694
Here we go.

448
00:55:45,979-->00:55:47,541
Come on.

449
00:55:55,432-->00:55:56,994
No.

450
00:56:00,019-->00:56:01,581
Damn.

451
00:56:02,556-->00:56:04,118
That's it.

452
00:56:25,318-->00:56:27,993
That's what happens when you choose Japanese.

453
00:56:27,994-->00:56:30,982
I almost had you and you know it.
- Almost does not count.

454
00:56:30,983-->00:56:35,186
Now is a good time to leave
for yourself even more ridiculous.

455
00:56:49,263-->00:56:50,825
Damn.

456
00:57:02,920-->00:57:04,482
I think we lost.

457
00:57:11,121-->00:57:12,683
How many did you beat him?

458
00:57:14,310-->00:57:15,872
Not enough.

459
00:57:16,960-->00:57:20,649
I was almost defeated and you know it.
- Almost does not count.

460
00:57:32,250-->00:57:34,157
Krueger, Kendall, follow me.

461
00:57:34,335-->00:57:37,417
Be sure the car has a relationship
has 8 / 71. Come on.

462
00:57:43,406-->00:57:45,621
What were you thinking?
- I do not know.

463
00:57:45,769-->00:57:49,903
I want you to keep track of.
Now I call your father.

464
00:57:49,904-->00:57:53,189
Mine almost gave a party
because I've defeated Krueger.

465
00:57:53,190-->00:57:56,647
I'll still talk to him,
go back to class.

466
00:58:01,094-->00:58:04,077
You put me in a bad position, Danny,
you know?

467
00:58:04,291-->00:58:06,767
I thought you were smarter.

468
00:58:30,946-->00:58:33,083
What does it need?
- I'm sorry.

469
00:58:34,839-->00:58:36,760
What does it need?

470
00:58:37,028-->00:58:39,972
Because I think now, maybe
I let him race.

471
00:58:40,052-->00:58:43,976
He does his homework, it is timely
I may have less severe.

472
00:58:46,724-->00:58:50,294
Give me your keys. You are nothing more than
an irresponsible, spoiled little child.

473
00:58:50,295-->00:58:54,643
Give me a lesson about responsibility.
You left your wife and child behind.

474
00:58:54,644-->00:58:57,901
You're 17, you remember
nothing about life.

475
00:58:57,903-->00:59:00,573
You do not know what it is
if your father left behind.

476
00:59:00,833-->00:59:02,396
I was ten.

477
00:59:02,397-->00:59:06,647
Come once again talking like 15 years of
hard work explodes in your face by a mistake.

478
00:59:06,648-->00:59:08,145
Maybe you better
concentrate on what you had ...

479
00:59:08,146-->00:59:10,109
rather than obsess about what you lost.

480
00:59:10,251-->00:59:12,846
Enough now, give me your keys.
Gone away.

481
00:59:12,892-->00:59:14,515
You know what I think?

482
00:59:14,665-->00:59:16,252
I think you're jealous.

483
00:59:16,368-->00:59:19,758
Because I have a real chance
to do what you never could.

484
00:59:19,759-->00:59:22,538
Give me your keys.

485
00:59:49,347-->00:59:50,934
Hello.

486
00:59:52,718-->00:59:54,280
Jessica is at home?

487
00:59:56,506-->00:59:58,377
What do you, Danny?

488
01:00:01,684-->01:00:04,750
I screwed up, but I'm not
went over there to race.

489
01:00:04,751-->01:00:06,314
Why were you there?

490
01:00:06,315-->01:00:08,525
I wanted to see where I compared
come to stand in the race.

491
01:00:08,526-->01:00:11,032
Why did not you just?
- I do not know.

492
01:00:15,619-->01:00:20,091
In LA I had a sponsor.
A very big.

493
01:00:20,092-->01:00:23,123
And that I lost.
- How?

494
01:00:23,124-->01:00:24,910
It does not matter why.

495
01:00:25,455-->01:00:30,467
When I heard of the race, I thought,
This is my chance, you know?

496
01:00:30,468-->01:00:31,810
My second chance.

497
01:00:31,811-->01:00:36,300
So I'm just a little time to spend
until you have the opportunity to get out of here?

498
01:00:36,301-->01:00:37,863
No, not at all.

499
01:00:37,864-->01:00:40,997
Have you ever thought that there
more important things than racing?

500
01:00:40,998-->01:00:44,462
I came here to apologize.
Why are you so difficult?

501
01:00:44,463-->01:00:48,422
If that's how you feel,
you'd better go.

502
01:00:49,606-->01:00:52,267
Are you serious?
- Now.

503
01:02:27,120-->01:02:29,234
Yes.
- Dad?

504
01:02:29,235-->01:02:31,003
I need your help.

505
01:02:32,473-->01:02:34,598
Where are you?

506
01:02:47,451-->01:02:50,472
Are you okay?
- Yes.

507
01:02:52,246-->01:02:54,838
Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

508
01:03:03,228-->01:03:04,790
What happened?

509
01:03:05,035-->01:03:07,435
Someone tampered with my brakes.

510
01:03:14,800-->01:03:17,241
You must have driven fast
in order to end up.

511
01:03:17,242-->01:03:19,924
I'm telling you,
someone messed with my car.

512
01:03:21,265-->01:03:23,800
It's always someone
different from their mistake with you.

513
01:03:25,053-->01:03:29,257
You could be dead. You do not think.

514
01:03:29,848-->01:03:32,143
What's wrong with you?

515
01:03:42,671-->01:03:44,366
Help me with the pull cord.

516
01:03:57,823-->01:03:59,385
Hello.

517
01:04:00,082-->01:04:03,308
Mommy?
- Danny.

518
01:04:04,670-->01:04:06,471
Can I come home?

519
01:04:07,554-->01:04:09,284
Danny anyway.

520
01:04:14,261-->01:04:19,293
If I did not think this is the best
was for you, I get you right.

521
01:04:22,324-->01:04:26,667
He hates me. He wants me here.
He never wanted.

522
01:04:26,668-->01:04:31,665
No, that's not true. It was his idea
for you to come there.

523
01:04:32,992-->01:04:36,488
Danny, talk to him.
He loves you.

524
01:04:37,058-->01:04:39,344
Maybe it's time to forgive him.

525
01:04:42,653-->01:04:44,276
I'm sorry, Mom.

526
01:04:45,990-->01:04:47,552
I know.

527
01:04:48,804-->01:04:50,366
I love you.

528
01:04:51,167-->01:04:52,730
I love you.

529
01:05:22,132-->01:05:23,694
Why did you leave?

530
01:05:34,990-->01:05:36,553
I could not take it anymore.

531
01:05:37,006-->01:05:39,829
I ruined everything by
possible path to follow ...

532
01:05:39,830-->01:05:42,772
instead of finishing second and
a family and career to have.

533
01:05:55,946-->01:05:58,683
Remember when I
came to collect from school?

534
01:05:59,246-->01:06:04,321
Just before I left?
- No.

535
01:06:04,911-->01:06:08,132
You had 39 degrees fever.

536
01:06:08,282-->01:06:11,179
The school nurse called
for you to collect.

537
01:06:11,827-->01:06:15,525
Mum was at work and
I had no job because I ...

538
01:06:18,117-->01:06:19,956
When I got there ...

539
01:06:23,434-->01:06:25,330
They did not give me.

540
01:06:26,250-->01:06:30,767
It was not yet half past nine
Morning and I was already drunk.

541
01:06:32,435-->01:06:33,997
I remember no more.

542
01:06:40,393-->01:06:41,956
You know what I did remember?

543
01:06:43,381-->01:06:46,299
The first time you took me
for a ride in this beast.

544
01:06:47,656-->01:06:50,250
I had the whole trip butterflies in my stomach.

545
01:06:50,679-->01:06:53,736
That feeling of acceleration was so intense.

546
01:06:53,981-->01:06:55,923
I was very scared before.

547
01:06:56,761-->01:06:58,323
Then I felt safe.

548
01:06:59,820-->01:07:02,208
Because I knew you behind the wheel.

549
01:07:12,851-->01:07:17,434
How hard it is to hear, I am happy.

550
01:07:17,994-->01:07:21,714
It was better that I have in recent years
was not, it was not a pretty picture.

551
01:07:22,096-->01:07:24,690
Then just hated me more.
- I hated you.

552
01:07:24,910-->01:07:26,897
I never hated.

553
01:07:29,150-->01:07:33,670
An occasional visit would have been nice.

554
01:07:36,031-->01:07:39,728
Yes. I should have been there.

555
01:08:01,643-->01:08:03,751
Thanks, I ask later
get a ride to Max.

556
01:08:09,566-->01:08:12,788
Hello, Krueger, where is your car?

557
01:08:12,789-->01:08:16,827
He gets new tires?
- Yes, guys. I do not anymore.

558
01:08:21,868-->01:08:23,669
Where's Fernando?

559
01:08:23,885-->01:08:26,386
He would normally have to play Ben.
I Am a need.

560
01:08:26,387-->01:08:29,964
He sits on the toilet.
- Do you kidding me?

561
01:08:29,965-->01:08:31,527
I'll do it.

562
01:08:37,993-->01:08:40,685
Nice that you want to do, Danny.

563
01:08:43,450-->01:08:46,386
Ok, before you start ...

564
01:08:46,387-->01:08:51,177
I want you in your own words say what
Do you think Claire wants to say.

565
01:08:54,778-->01:08:57,426
Okay, just keep in mind
he is a compulsive gambler and ...

566
01:08:57,427-->01:09:01,346
He just bet all his money on it wrong
horse, now he must answer.

567
01:09:01,486-->01:09:04,390
I think he wants to offer his apologies.

568
01:09:04,391-->01:09:05,954
Excuses?

569
01:09:05,955-->01:09:11,001
He wagered just her wedding ring.
You will have to do better as "I'm sorry".

570
01:09:14,310-->01:09:16,181
He would say he was stupid.

571
01:09:16,533-->01:09:19,969
Him and that his addiction was just too much.

572
01:09:20,147-->01:09:22,573
Well. What else?

573
01:09:22,754-->01:09:26,360
He would say he should have listened
to her when she wanted to help him.

574
01:09:26,647-->01:09:28,554
And he would say, thank you.

575
01:09:29,426-->01:09:30,989
You're welcome.

576
01:09:57,541-->01:10:01,640
This is a familiar face. Long ago
I have seen you again driving that thing.

577
01:10:01,641-->01:10:04,793
I thought I'd dust it off and apply today
my son with them to school.

578
01:10:05,013-->01:10:07,957
I think you've heard that our
boys had a collision last night ...

579
01:10:07,958-->01:10:11,165
as we used to.
Kendall only won it once.

580
01:10:19,956-->01:10:22,585
It's good for business if he wins.

581
01:10:22,736-->01:10:24,916
Other children will then
along and give all their money.

582
01:10:28,748-->01:10:32,563
I'm not sure if your son
future in racing.

583
01:10:32,568-->01:10:37,525
But you can always name your
case change in Krueger and son.

584
01:10:40,042-->01:10:41,878
You know what, Jimmy?

585
01:10:42,927-->01:10:47,370
It's one thing to know how the
components of your car can change.

586
01:10:49,043-->01:10:56,509
It's another thing to know
how they all work together.

587
01:12:12,934-->01:12:15,879
Hello, boy.
- What is it?

588
01:12:16,062-->01:12:19,726
Remember that today is the last day to
toestemmingsbewijsjes you to bring.

589
01:12:19,727-->01:12:21,289
So give them away if you have them.

590
01:12:36,322-->01:12:38,530
I'm glad you're participating.

591
01:12:47,130-->01:12:49,545
Will you be part
from my pit crew?

592
01:12:49,598-->01:12:51,160
Absolutely.

593
01:12:53,942-->01:12:58,847
We have three days, guys, so let
the front strip, stripping everything.

594
01:12:58,876-->01:13:01,058
Can you still use a few hands?

595
01:13:06,626-->01:13:08,189
Thanks.

596
01:13:08,190-->01:13:10,566
Protectors, the front cross member,
radiator support ...

597
01:13:10,567-->01:13:14,963
2 arms, intercooler,
the large air intake and total ...

598
01:13:15,905-->01:13:19,896
We do not get that, it's too much.

599
01:13:26,921-->01:13:29,794
Tomorrow at school, everyone goes home.

600
01:13:29,979-->01:13:32,270
We come together again tomorrow.

601
01:13:54,376-->01:13:57,755
Hi, Randy.
Same for you.

602
01:13:58,476-->01:14:01,013
Do you still interested in my Buick?

603
01:14:22,247-->01:14:25,154
I'm Greg, hello.
Long ago.

604
01:14:25,479-->01:14:27,041
What can I do for you?

605
01:14:29,927-->01:14:33,498
I want you to make a price,
it is for my son.

606
01:14:36,112-->01:14:38,195
He participates in the school race.

607
01:15:02,455-->01:15:06,519
Have you sold the Buick?
- Yes.

608
01:15:08,918-->01:15:12,379
There should be enough to
for the rest of your stuff.

609
01:15:14,409-->01:15:16,599
But he needs you
your first trophy worried.

610
01:15:18,857-->01:15:21,701
Time to leave the past and
to concentrate on what's coming.

611
01:15:24,244-->01:15:25,831
Thanks, Dad.

612
01:15:26,746-->01:15:28,547
That's the least I could do.

613
01:15:31,611-->01:15:33,277
Help me now to unload this stuff.

614
01:15:37,067-->01:15:40,847
The right button makes your car is ready
and the left button makes the nitro finished.

615
01:15:41,029-->01:15:43,603
Kendall has a heavier
engine and a supercharger ...

616
01:15:43,604-->01:15:45,650
and you have 200 units of nitrogen under your thumb.

617
01:15:45,651-->01:15:49,933
If the light turns green, hit it.
Keep it pressed all the time.

618
01:15:53,400-->01:15:58,516
Yes, a GT-40 Mansfield. Is that the
best price you can give me?

619
01:16:06,537-->01:16:08,308
The rocket fuel.

620
01:16:30,342-->01:16:31,904
How does it feel?

621
01:16:32,010-->01:16:34,060
Feels good and sounds good.

622
01:16:34,790-->01:16:37,369
I have a little surprise.

623
01:16:39,586-->01:16:41,357
I do not like surprises.

624
01:16:50,255-->01:16:52,921
That's good advertising for the garage.

625
01:16:53,104-->01:16:55,841
You would think there is need to
here to change to an import dealer.

626
01:16:57,831-->01:17:00,081
Ok, good work everyone.
We go racing tomorrow.

627
01:17:23,200-->01:17:27,330
Welcome everyone, to the NHRA racing school.

628
01:17:27,331-->01:17:33,190
With over 65 students and 32 schools,
this is the biggest event ever.

629
01:17:36,545-->01:17:42,145
Look out for the home favorite and Jake Kendall
the whole team of Kendall Performance Centers.

630
01:17:42,146-->01:17:45,089
And newcomer Danny Krueger this year ...

631
01:17:45,268-->01:17:49,480
that drives a 2.5 liter, four cylinder,
four-wheel drive Subaru STI.

632
01:17:49,482-->01:17:54,863
It is one of the few four-cylinder
and that goes against all these big V8's.

633
01:17:54,864-->01:17:57,655
Let's see if this Subaru
There has to cope.

634
01:17:57,656-->01:18:00,166
We would like to thank all our sponsors ...

635
01:18:03,338-->01:18:05,835
You load it, I'm going to register us.

636
01:18:15,744-->01:18:18,931
Next to the warm up lap
Miguel Sanchez ...

637
01:18:19,150-->01:18:21,473
with its classical turbo diesel
truck, "Little Red".

638
01:18:42,260-->01:18:47,430
11.22 and 11.41. I have these two
see all the faster cars go so ...

639
01:18:47,432-->01:18:49,872
I do not think they have given everything.

640
01:18:51,922-->01:18:53,616
You go down, Krueger.

641
01:18:54,389-->01:18:56,190
It is hereditary.

642
01:18:56,440-->01:18:58,419
Like father, like son.

643
01:19:00,228-->01:19:02,550
It seems that you
have chosen the wrong team, Jess.

644
01:19:02,729-->01:19:04,803
It seems that I
have chosen the wrong girlfriend.

645
01:19:06,169-->01:19:09,327
Ignore them,
You need to stay focused.

646
01:19:09,541-->01:19:11,103
Here.

647
01:19:11,486-->01:19:14,509
We are ready to go.
- Fantastic.

648
01:19:14,510-->01:19:18,505
Let's us be at the start,
The formation lap is almost over.

649
01:19:18,506-->01:19:21,890
The first round we must provide
we end up under 13 seconds.

650
01:19:21,891-->01:19:23,260
That would not be a problem.

651
01:19:29,870-->01:19:34,273
This is the last race in the warm up lap
Danny Krueger in STI.

652
01:19:34,388-->01:19:35,951
His opponent was Alex Dod ...

653
01:19:35,952-->01:19:38,339
with the classic Mustang
Washington secondary.

654
01:19:43,215-->01:19:44,910
Look at the burn-out.

655
01:19:45,058-->01:19:49,638
Dod make the tires nice and sticky so
he maximum grip on the starting line.

656
01:19:49,853-->01:19:54,298
It is not necessary to warm up your tires
if you have a four-wheel-drive Subaru.

657
01:20:09,141-->01:20:12,363
Krueger had some problems with the
starting line and the Mustang was gone.

658
01:20:12,477-->01:20:14,419
Let's see if he can overtake Krueger.

659
01:20:30,130-->01:20:34,647
It failed.
Alex comes in at 12.29 ...

660
01:20:34,648-->01:20:38,834
Danny Krueger, there is only
correct with his 12.98.

661
01:20:41,807-->01:20:43,723
The race has been won.

662
01:20:46,081-->01:20:48,812
I know.
- Come on, man.

663
01:20:48,813-->01:20:51,252
The circuit is thicker than the street,
I did not expect that.

664
01:20:51,253-->01:20:55,062
And the strength ...
- Each round Now you have time drop.

665
01:20:55,063-->01:20:56,625
You would have to have around 11.

666
01:20:56,627-->01:21:00,315
If you lose a race,
is done. Concentrate.

667
01:21:00,538-->01:21:03,839
To all our racers,
we go to round n.

668
01:21:03,840-->01:21:09,767
Now the starting line, Grant Warner
with his 1969 Oldsmobile 442.

669
01:21:09,768-->01:21:11,342
Grant is quite the summer practicing ...

670
01:21:11,343-->01:21:14,670
and let me say this,
wheeler that bars are not just for luck.

671
01:21:15,899-->01:21:20,763
The opponent, Jake Kendall,
with his 2011 Mustang GT.

672
01:21:20,764-->01:21:24,751
These are our fastest racers
who compete against each other.

673
01:21:43,318-->01:21:45,604
And take a look at Jake, who thumb
down is for Grant.

674
01:21:45,716-->01:21:47,992
Jake is confident.

675
01:22:22,657-->01:22:26,381
It seems that Grant
fast car has to go ...

676
01:22:26,382-->01:22:28,470
who goes on the trailer home.

677
01:22:28,471-->01:22:32,902
Jake Kendall won with a time
of 10.98 and went 127 miles per hour.

678
01:22:47,157-->01:22:49,207
As next, Danny Krueger
STI against his ...

679
01:22:49,381-->01:22:51,976
Kevin Bakar and his 1970 Chevy Nova.

680
01:22:52,127-->01:22:55,079
Let's see if Danny
This leaves more time.

681
01:22:59,078-->01:23:02,129
A good start for Danny,
He stands for the Nova.

682
01:23:11,345-->01:23:15,178
And he did it.
Danny Krueger goes to the next round ...

683
01:23:15,180-->01:23:18,061
with a time of 11.40 and 121 miles per hour.

684
01:23:18,062-->01:23:20,929
That was a tough ride.

685
01:23:21,944-->01:23:24,966
It is difficult to Andrea Faust and her hot,
Dodge rose about to overlook.

686
01:23:27,295-->01:23:29,589
This girl racing all her life.

687
01:23:29,590-->01:23:32,091
She knows how the boys
to give a firm ride.

688
01:23:32,092-->01:23:34,842
They sure like to see her race.

689
01:23:47,174-->01:23:49,710
Andrea Faust goes to the next round.

690
01:23:49,711-->01:23:53,706
There is some competition between these young
and they're certainly not done.

691
01:23:53,707-->01:23:55,270
Let's see what they can do.

692
01:23:57,147-->01:23:59,385
H, how are you?

693
01:23:59,386-->01:24:01,450
How are you?
- Good to see you.

694
01:24:01,451-->01:24:03,534
You too.
Do you too?

695
01:24:03,681-->01:24:06,892
No, we belong to Danny Krueger.
- With the Subaru.

696
01:24:06,948-->01:24:09,206
He looks good.

697
01:24:09,207-->01:24:11,114
As a birthday cake.

698
01:24:11,257-->01:24:14,564
In the quarterfinals are still
Kendall Performance a racer ...

699
01:24:14,565-->01:24:18,746
Bradford for the secondary,
Clint Johnson with his 1969 Chevy Chevelle ...

700
01:24:18,747-->01:24:22,291
which takes on Danny Krueger in his
Corvaille from The Fast And The Furious.

701
01:24:36,974-->01:24:39,083
The winner goes to the semifinals.

702
01:25:13,776-->01:25:18,393
An easy victory for Krueger
with 11.17 against 11.88 of Johnson.

703
01:25:18,394-->01:25:20,402
Yes, successfully.

704
01:25:24,932-->01:25:28,304
In the first semifinal
Andrea Faust, we ...

705
01:25:28,305-->01:25:31,122
with her beautiful brown hair
From the Patriot secondary ...

706
01:25:31,124-->01:25:34,622
by Jake Kendall with
Mustang is from Bradford.

707
01:26:15,321-->01:26:18,974
Jake Kendall goes to the final.

708
01:26:18,975-->01:26:21,044
This is the fastest ride today.

709
01:26:21,194-->01:26:23,209
For the next semi-final ...

710
01:26:23,349-->01:26:25,292
We Miguel Sanchez
with his Dodge truck ...

711
01:26:25,400-->01:26:27,548
against Krueger in STI.

712
01:26:28,458-->01:26:30,914
Hi, Tom.
- Neil, how are you?

713
01:26:30,915-->01:26:33,024
Karl, Tom Bricks.
- How are you?

714
01:26:33,025-->01:26:34,587
Well.

715
01:26:34,588-->01:26:38,246
You have three of your students there.
Impressive.

716
01:26:39,474-->01:26:41,275
A guess who will win?

717
01:26:43,470-->01:26:45,342
Is that what you are going to give me?

718
01:26:45,834-->01:26:49,558
The liquids are ok.
Everything checked? Ready to go?

719
01:26:57,858-->01:26:59,797
What an idiot.

720
01:27:02,932-->01:27:06,863
That thing has a lot of torque,
He will beat you to the starting line ...

721
01:27:06,864-->01:27:11,028
no doubt. Let him not be distracted.
Stay focused on maximum torque.

722
01:27:11,029-->01:27:14,825
You get him in the end,
then you have won.

723
01:27:41,715-->01:27:44,428
Fun, h?
- Yes.

724
01:28:19,872-->01:28:21,946
Danny Krueger gets him on the last.

725
01:28:22,097-->01:28:25,506
Ladies and gentlemen, Danny Krueger continues.
He took it just in time.

726
01:28:25,507-->01:28:27,069
What?

727
01:28:27,344-->01:28:28,906
He did it.

728
01:28:33,147-->01:28:34,710
An unexpected victory.

729
01:28:34,781-->01:28:38,499
I can not believe this little Subaru
has made it to the final.

730
01:28:38,500-->01:28:40,688
But Krueger's work is not over.

731
01:28:40,689-->01:28:45,917
Jake Kendall has been faster rounds
Danny Krueger traveled than ever.

732
01:28:45,918-->01:28:50,119
Danny must hope for a miracle.
Or at least a few more cylinders.

733
01:28:50,350-->01:28:52,988
What do you mean?
- The thrust increase ...

734
01:28:53,130-->01:28:55,329
otherwise I think I better not
can do more than my last trip.

735
01:28:55,330-->01:28:57,783
Danny, what are you doing?

736
01:28:57,784-->01:29:00,303
Your turbo is running at maximum,
you will blow up your engine.

737
01:29:00,304-->01:29:02,756
It is only at 23 bar
it is a bit higher.

738
01:29:02,895-->01:29:04,482
I do a benefit show.

739
01:29:04,633-->01:29:06,399
Do you know how a few
seconds of your time can do?

740
01:29:06,545-->01:29:08,107
How?

741
01:29:08,490-->01:29:10,113
Powershift with this ride.

742
01:29:10,297-->01:29:12,892
Is not that just as dangerous?
- Not unless you screwed up.

743
01:29:13,356-->01:29:14,943
Make us proud.

744
01:29:18,603-->01:29:23,563
I do not want to embarrass us Krueger.
That would be very bad, you know?

745
01:29:23,712-->01:29:25,299
Yes, sir.

746
01:29:27,534-->01:29:29,122
Is it almost done?

747
01:29:29,515-->01:29:32,248
Yes, the new tires are on it
and the dampers are off.

748
01:29:32,249-->01:29:35,036
You would have to go faster now,
but not too fast.

749
01:29:35,037-->01:29:36,600
Yeah, okay.

750
01:29:42,061-->01:29:46,852
Here we are,
the final of the NHRA racing school.

751
01:29:53,251-->01:29:54,981
What is power shifting?

752
01:29:55,093-->01:29:57,107
It's off without
accelerator release.

753
01:29:57,248-->01:29:59,151
In turbo cars keeps the engine ...

754
01:29:59,152-->01:30:01,619
at full speed between two
gears for maximum acceleration.

755
01:30:01,765-->01:30:03,352
You need fast
for it to be.

756
01:30:03,503-->01:30:06,092
There is no room for
errors or otherwise 'boom'.

757
01:30:34,918-->01:30:36,613
RICE DID YOU?

758
01:31:09,323-->01:31:10,885
Go.

759
01:34:44,958-->01:34:46,975
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my honor ...

760
01:34:46,976-->01:34:52,366
Danny Krueger for this year to call
as the winner of the NHRA racing school.

761
01:34:55,524-->01:34:58,972
Congratulations, you have talent.
See you next summer.

762
01:34:58,973-->01:35:00,535
Thank you.

763
01:35:08,104-->01:35:10,481
Maybe your idea is not so bad.

764
01:35:10,502-->01:35:12,064
Any idea?

765
01:35:12,065-->01:35:13,967
In order to transform my garage
to import a race shop.

766
