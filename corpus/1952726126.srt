(children singing)

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,138
¶ When our weeping's over ¶

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,743
¶ He will bid us welcome ¶

4
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:12,545
¶ We shall come rejoicing ¶

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,181
¶ Bringing in the sheaves ¶

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,650
¶ Bringing
in the sheaves ¶

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,253
¶ Bringing in the sheaves ¶

8
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,789
¶ We shall come rejoicing ¶

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,359
- (pig snorting)
- ¶ Bringing in the sheaves ¶

- ¶ Bringing in the sheaves ¶
- (pig squealing)

¶ Bringing in the sheaves ¶

12
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,265
¶ We shall come rejoicing ¶

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:37,673
- (squealing stops)
- ¶ Bringing in the sheaves ¶

14
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:41,534
Now you've got drought here.

15
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,945
You've got drought

16
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,347
right here in Gatlin, Nebraska.

17
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:49,617
And there's not gonna be
no harvest this year...

18
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:53,756
not in this Lord's year
of 1963, there ain't.

19
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:56,258
- And say why.
- [All]: Sin.

20
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,960
Say that louder.

21
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,062
Sin!

22
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:01,964
Oh, we drown in sin here,

23
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:04,734
- and there's no rain for our corn.
- (snorting softly)

24
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:07,203
- And why is that?
- (children murmur)

25
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:10,507
[Preacher]: Because of
all of the adults in this world.

26
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:14,377
God has spoken to me
in a dream.

27
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,045
And in that dream...

28
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:19,842
He said that
all adults are sinners!

29
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:22,923
He said there's
not a soul here in Gatlin

30
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:25,002
over the age of 19

31
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,878
who isn't wallowing in sin,
loving it, even as they drown

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,396
- like pigs in a mire.
- (groaning softly)

33
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:33,631
It says in the Good Book,

34
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:36,635
"Suffer the children
to come unto me".

35
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:39,404
And if this town has any hope,

36
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:42,975
it's in you young people.

37
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:44,876
And so I want you to shout it out!

38
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:47,908
- [All]: Sin!
- Sin!

39
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,753
But, brothers and sisters,

40
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:57,290
we know the old ways of God,
isn't it so?

41
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,893
We know there's
a God of the Old Testament,

42
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:01,594
as well as the New...

43
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:05,499
the God of sacrifice,

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,236
the God who walked
on the face of the earth,

45
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:12,372
He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

46
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:15,311
All:
He Who Walks Behind The Rows.

47
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:18,346
He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

48
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,716
God does speak to me
in my dreams,

49
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:25,220
and God has told me
that it is now our time...

50
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,389
time to make sacrifice,

51
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,521
time to kill!

52
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,130
(squeals)

53
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:36,065
(snorting softly)

54
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:39,668
Now the Good Book does say
that a child shall lead them.

55
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,807
So do what God tells me
in my dreams to tell to you,

56
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:49,646
and never go without water
or be hungry again!

57
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,982
- [All]: Praise God.
- Praise the Lord.

58
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:54,852
Praise God. Praise the Lord.

59
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,518
Praise God!

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,294
(radio static)

61
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:07,156
(man speaking on radio)

62
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:10,035
Man:
Hail Mary, full of grace,

63
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,572
- help me win this stock car race.
- (rock music playing)

64
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:16,137
All right. Boogie.

65
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:21,347
¶ Riding on the road
to nowhere ¶

66
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:25,785
- ¶ Trying to keep love alive... ¶
- [Woman]: Turn it down!

67
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,487
Do you want to break
my eardrums?

68
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:30,089
Yes, Vicky.
Whatever you say.

69
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,159
[Man on radio]:... who was
cited for reckless driving.

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,597
¶ Be happy
if you'll just stay with me ¶

71
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,165
(vocalizes)

72
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,836
¶ I know everything
will be all right ¶

73
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:45,004
¶ We'll laugh and we'll sing
all through the night... ¶

74
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:47,399
- [Vicky]: Too loud, Burt!
- What's that?

75
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,979
- (music stops)
- You play it like that

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,013
- just to get under my skin.
- Oh, come on.

77
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,182
Your paranoia is
showing again, Vicky.

78
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,885
Sometimes, I wonder
how I ended up married to you.

79
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,287
By saying two little words.

80
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:03,059
Shut up.

81
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,394
(Burt sighs)

82
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,629
(sighs)

83
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,922
Nebraska.

84
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,774
I'm hungry. Where are we?

85
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,189
Nebraska.

86
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,725
Yes, I know that.

87
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:36,728
But where in the hell are we?
Where's the lunch stop?

88
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,831
You've got the road atlas.
You should look it up.

89
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,799
You still remember
how to read, don't you?

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,204
Such a comedian.
Is that why we got off the interstate,

91
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:48,874
to look at 60 miles of corn and listen
to the wit and wisdom of Burt?

92
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:53,043
Just get off it, Vicky!
Will you just get off it?!

93
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:58,517
(rock music playing)

94
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:01,454
¶ Oh, well, they call me ¶

95
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:04,491
- ¶ Sergeant Evil... ¶
- (music gets louder)

96
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:09,829
¶ But I just played a part ¶

97
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,936
¶ They think
my eyes are tearing ¶

98
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:21,574
¶ But they don't know me
at all, yeah! ¶

99
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:29,184
(sighs)

100
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,886
- (music stops)
- I'm sorry.

101
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,522
It's all right. It's fine.

102
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:37,359
It's just that I've driven so far
on the interstate... 1500 miles...

103
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,029
- and since you won't drive, I...
- You know I get migraines

104
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,732
- when I drive for a long time.
- I know you do. I know, okay?

105
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,234
That's why I asked you to navigate
for me on these secondary roads,

106
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,560
and you said you would.

107
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,612
(sighs)

108
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,780
- Well?
- Where did we get off the interstate?

109
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:59,174
Back in Grand Island.

110
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,485
The next town is...

111
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:05,856
Gatlin.
It's about 10 miles.

112
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:09,149
(boy wheezing)

113
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,661
(groans)

114
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,969
A wide space in the road.
Do you suppose we can go there

115
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,636
and get something to eat?
Or does the almighty schedule say

116
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,741
we have to go on until 2 o'clock
like we did yesterday?

117
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:24,543
All right. You know what?
I have about had it with you.

118
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,645
(choking)

119
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:29,449
As far as I am concerned,
we can call it quits right now.

120
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,617
We can just turn around and see
that lawyer you wanted to see

121
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,453
- because I have had it...
- Watch out!

122
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,922
- No!
- (tires screeching)

123
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:38,418
(Vicky screams, gasps)

124
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,762
(panting)

125
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:50,401
Burt!

126
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,406
A dog... tell me it was a dog.

127
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,947
It was a boy.
It was a little boy.

128
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:02,377
He ran out of the corn.

129
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,823
He's dead.
He's dead, isn't he?

130
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:10,115
Oh, yeah.

131
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:17,599
Congratulations, tiger.

132
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,688
It's manslaughter!

133
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:45,363
That's what they call it!
You took your eyes off the road!

134
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,131
Well, don't you
wanna come see

135
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,868
so you can tell
all your NRA buddies

136
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,103
what you bagged
in Nebraska, huh?!

137
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,567
Don't you wanna come
and see?

138
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,034
What're you gonna do?!

139
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,719
What are you gonna do?

140
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,058
Answer me!

141
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,350
Answer me, you...
(panting)

142
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,965
Answer me when I talk to you!

143
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,225
Look at me!

144
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,529
Look at me!

145
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:34,750
How'd you handle it
over in Nam, huh?

146
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:38,220
How'd you handle it in the hooches?

147
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:40,422
What do you use?
Grease guns, right?

148
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:42,158
Grease guns and Zippos!

149
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,593
Settle down.
You're hysterical.

150
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:47,630
(chuckles)
Oh, tell me. You crapped out.

151
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:51,536
Big Vietnam War hero, huh?

152
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:55,005
Purple Heart
and all that, huh?

153
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:58,542
Come on, John Wayne!
What are you gonna do?!

154
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:00,877
It's no time to go Section 8!

155
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:02,779
You ran that little boy down.

156
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,516
He was just a little boy,
you ran him down

157
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:08,479
and you can't...

158
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,466
(sobs)

159
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,894
You're going to jail.

160
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,704
- You're going to jail.
- Yeah?

161
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,740
- Yeah.
- You're rabid.

162
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,909
Okay. It's taken me
all this time to figure it out.

163
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,179
You've got a terminal case
of rabies.

164
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,948
Shut up.

165
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,977
(Vicky pants)

166
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:47,294
- What are you doing?
- Turning him over.

167
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,996
- No. You're not supposed to touch...
- I wanna see what I did.

168
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:56,101
- I'm sorry about this, fella.
- I don't wanna look.

169
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,105
(sighs)

170
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,246
(panting)

171
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,911
His carotid artery and jugular vein
have been severed.

172
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:16,083
His throat's been cut.

173
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,161
Somebody scragged this kid...

174
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:22,365
bayonet, maybe a kitchen knife,
a cleaver... I don't know.

175
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,657
It sure wasn't
a two-dollar buck.

176
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:31,540
You don't go to any more Kiwanis
meetings after your throat's been cut.

177
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,536
I sure learned that
in the jungle.

178
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,480
You get 20, maybe 30 seconds,
before you...

179
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:39,683
- That little boy is dead.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:40,885
- You ran him down.
- Yeah.

181
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,787
- And you killed him!
- Sure, I ran him down,

182
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:44,722
but I didn't kill him.

183
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:47,292
Look. Go on, look at him.

184
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:48,926
I haven't gone crazy.
His throat's been cut.

185
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,596
Why would anybody cut
a little boy's throat? Huh, why?

186
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,032
You like the idea that I killed him
too much to let it go?

187
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,235
- No. Of course not.
- Just look!

188
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:02,003
- Please look.
- (whimpers)

189
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:10,250
(gasps, pants)

190
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:11,885
- Hey hey hey.
- Oh!

191
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:15,721
- Don't faint. Look at me.
- Okay.

192
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,291
Don't look around.
Don't look around.

193
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,895
- There's so much blood.
- His throat's been cut,

194
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,832
and that corn over there
is all bent and twisted.

195
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,067
- Where?
- Don't look around.

196
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:27,067
Ow!

197
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,770
Don't act suspicious.

198
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:31,206
(pants)
Okay.

199
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,406
- Okay?
- Yeah.

200
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,378
Now we're gonna cover
this boy up

201
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,382
- and we're gonna put him in the trunk.
- (whimpering)

202
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,983
- I'm sorry about this, Vicky...
- Okay.

203
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,821
- but we've gotta do this.
- Okay.

204
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:49,114
(sobbing)

205
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:54,563
Sure. Yeah.

206
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,833
That didn't cut his throat...

207
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,835
not all ragged
and jagged like this.

208
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:02,973
No army sergeant ever showed
the finer points of hand-to-hand combat

209
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:05,174
to this poor boy's murderer.

210
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:08,646
No, he was as good as dead
when I hit him.

211
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:12,278
- (crackles)
- (grunts)

212
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,483
Okay.

213
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:27,599
Get in.

214
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,835
No. Driver's side.

215
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,372
- You want me to drive?
- No. I want you to start the car

216
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,841
and wait for me.
I'm gonna go take a look.

217
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,878
I can see blood on the corn
where the boy came out.

218
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,580
I think I saw something else.
It's hard to tell from the road,

219
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:44,049
but you can hide an army in there.

220
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,086
The Vietcong sure did.

221
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:50,117
In the paddies of course,
not the corn... like jungles.

222
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,094
Scragged, right?

223
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:54,795
- Someone scragged him?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:57,697
Sometimes, I think you'd sell your soul
to the devil for it never to have ended.

225
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:59,667
That way you could go on
doing sweeps and smoking dope

226
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:02,170
for the rest of your life 'cause
that was the high point of your life,

227
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,871
wasn't it, Burt?
Good old Vietnam, right?

228
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:07,508
This isn't one of your damn
consciousness-raising groups, Vicky.

229
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,811
Now get in the car.
That's an order.

230
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,875
Screw your orders.

231
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:15,717
Vicky, would you just do it?!

232
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,683
(sighs)

233
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,060
What's up with the gun?

234
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,764
His throat was cut, right?

235
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,034
They're probably gone,
but I don't wanna take any chances.

236
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:34,737
Now get in the car,
keep the engine running

237
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:37,106
and you'd better bug out
should anyone come out of there,

238
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,677
no matter how innocent he,
she or they may look, okay?

239
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:41,779
Do you understand?

240
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,048
I don't wanna sit in the car
all by myself.

241
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:47,910
At this point,
I don't really care what you want.

242
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:51,088
How did I end up married
to a son of a bitch like you

243
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,915
in the first place, huh?
I wonder about that.

244
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:57,225
I wonder about that a lot.

245
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:01,398
So do I, babe.

246
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,564
I'm scared.

247
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,878
Is that all right, sir?

248
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,012
Is it all right for me
to be scared, sir?

249
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:15,213
That's fine by me.

250
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:26,016
(car engine starts)

251
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:02,262
(panting softly)

252
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:15,742
(flies buzzing)

253
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:10,427
(continues panting)

254
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,675
(car honking)

255
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:28,791
(honking stops)

256
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:31,390
(leaves rustle)

257
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,671
(rustles)

258
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:46,233
(honking)

259
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:51,581
(quivering)

260
00:16:51,582 --> 00:16:54,875
(leaves rustling)

261
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,220
(wood creaking)

262
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:30,623
- Oh, God.
- (engine stops)

263
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:33,622
(keys jingle)

264
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:42,662
Hey! Mr. Comedian!

265
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:48,238
Where are you?

266
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:52,980
It's not funny!

267
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:57,385
Burt!

268
00:17:57,386 --> 00:18:00,088
I told you to stay in the car.

269
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,225
I thought somebody was watching me.
I looked behind me

270
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:04,517
- and I couldn't see you.
- Get in.

271
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:07,622
I should've tied a string
around the antenna.

272
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:10,399
I got lost in there for awhile.

273
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,191
It's a good thing you called
when you did. Push over.

274
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:18,841
Here, grab this.

275
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:20,978
What is it?

276
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,147
Is that... is that blood?
Is that his blood?

277
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:26,315
- Yeah, I guess so. Grab it.
- No!

278
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,892
(thunder crashing)

279
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,043
I was scared.

280
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:24,046
Uh-huh.

281
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,746
Afraid... I was afraid.

282
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,251
You went into the corn and it felt
like somebody was watching me.

283
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,254
Well, maybe someone was.

284
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,656
You know what I'm talking about.

285
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:38,328
Someone was there, all right?
I could feel it too.

286
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,631
I remember that feeling
from Do Luc.

287
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:44,560
You don't forget that.

288
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,941
- (thunder crashing)
- What did you say the next town is?

289
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:52,910
Gatlin.

290
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:54,678
Does it look big enough
to have a police station?

291
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,244
No, it's just a dot.

292
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,785
That little boy was on foot, right?

293
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,721
Gatlin is the only town for 80 miles.

294
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:07,425
- He must have come from there.
- If you say so.

295
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:13,521
(thunder crashing)

296
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,769
Why? Why would anybody
wanna do that to a little kid?

297
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,130
I don't know.

298
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,542
(sighs)
We might get a better idea

299
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:26,312
- if we look inside that.
- Hmm?

300
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,638
Do you really think so?

301
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:31,316
Probably not.

302
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,053
It's worth a shot.

303
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:35,345
Do you wanna open it?

304
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,359
Okay.

305
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,460
Hey...

306
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,967
thanks.

307
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,428
(radio static)

308
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:19,002
Didn't we cross a barn
or something back there?

309
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,937
No. It was deserted...

310
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:23,940
no power feeds
from the road...

311
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,708
no good.

312
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:28,879
- I think you see everything.
- Huh.

313
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,650
It freaks me out sometimes.
It really does.

314
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:35,319
I just feel as if
this is my responsibility, Vicky.

315
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,056
I hit him, even if he was
bleeding to death when I did.

316
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,527
- You see, I don't see everything.
- (static continues)

317
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:45,627
I sure didn't see him.
I took my eyes off the road.

318
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:51,970
We haven't seen a car
or a truck in like an hour.

319
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:53,271
It's weird.

320
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,575
Maybe Nebraska's playing
a home game.

321
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:56,909
(static)

322
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,277
Why don't you tell that
to your American Studies class

323
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,247
when we get back home?

324
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:04,050
"In Nebraska,
radio hasn't been invented yet".

325
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:07,453
- There's nothing at all?
- Zilch.

326
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:09,390
The other knot is coming now.

327
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,425
(boy shouts on radio)
Atonement!

328
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:15,496
Only by the blood
of the lamb are we saved!

329
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:18,098
"Atonement" is the word,
brothers and sisters.

330
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,001
There are some that think...

331
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,970
No wonder
we're coming in five-by.

332
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:24,105
We're right on top
of the radio tower.

333
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:25,907
[Boy preacher]:... "wilt thou be
besmirched by the world".

334
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:29,344
Now is that what
the word of God teaches us?

335
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:32,747
Holy Jesus!
When are they gonna know

336
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:34,249
- that way is dead?
- Hmm.

337
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,853
When are they gonna know
that the wages of the world

338
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:40,456
are paid on the other side, that there's
no room for the fornicator?!

339
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,592
- [Children]: No!
- No room for the defiler of the corn!

340
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:46,195
- No vacancy!
- [Vicky]: Wha...

341
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:49,197
No room for the homosexual!
No vacancy.

342
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:51,334
- This drivel makes me sick.
- (radio turns off)

343
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:54,104
What did he say about the corn?

344
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,909
- I wasn't paying attention.
- He said something about the corn.

345
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,770
I know he did...
something weird.

346
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,156
Hey hey!

347
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,152
There is life in Nebraska.

348
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,207
Are you sure anyone is here?

349
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,145
It doesn't matter.
I just wanna use the pay phone.

350
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:34,846
I have to report this... murder.

351
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,351
Are you all right?

352
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:40,420
Yeah. Yeah, I will be...

353
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:43,989
as soon as we're 1,000 miles
away from here.

354
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,961
Sunny and sinful California.

355
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:51,130
The Rocky Mountains
between us and Nebraska.

356
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,236
You got any change?

357
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:57,038
Nope.

358
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,102
I'll just dial the emergency operator.

359
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:50,253
We'll be in town
in a few minutes.

360
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,242
Looks like folks
in Gatlin got religion.

361
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:06,478
I thought all folks
in Nebraska had religion.

362
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,882
It sure sounds
that way from the radio.

363
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,719
Mm-hmm. Have you been
reading the signs?

364
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,754
"A cloud by day,

365
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:18,291
a pillar of fire by night".

366
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:22,029
When they called it the Bible Belt,
they sure weren't kidding.

367
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,132
"Take this...

368
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,335
and eat...

369
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:30,871
saith the Lord,

370
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:35,667
God of hosts".

371
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:40,115
It's what they say
when they give you communion.

372
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:44,818
Yeah? I bet they use cornbread
for holy wafer around these parts.

373
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:49,823
- Got it.
- Attagirl.

374
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:55,130
A shirt...

375
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,457
a belt...

376
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,337
What is this?

377
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:03,842
That's a real golden oldie.

378
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:06,439
Huh.

379
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:12,111
Anything strikes you as funny
about that radio sermon?

380
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:16,522
You were obviously never
the son of a preacher...

381
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:20,125
dragged from tent to tent,
going to meetings,

382
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:22,927
hearing every kind of evangelist
preying on the uneducated,

383
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:26,531
the lonely and the weak
instead of praying for them.

384
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:29,324
I had enough of that religious crap
to last me forever.

385
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:31,872
I told you about it.

386
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:34,974
Yeah, but didn't this preacher
sound young?

387
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:37,977
A teenager, maybe, but that's what's
so monstrous about their whole trip.

388
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:40,579
They like to get them
while their minds are still rubber,

389
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,085
and all the emotional checks
and balances to put in.

390
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:46,887
You should've seen
some of the ones I got saved by.

391
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:49,256
Let's see, there was...

392
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,591
Baby Hortense,

393
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:53,760
the singing marvel.
She was eight.

394
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,129
She'd come on singing
"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"

395
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,566
while her daddy passed the plate,
telling everybody to

396
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:01,336
(deep voice)
"Dig deep now, brothers and sisters.

397
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,871
Let's not let
this blessed child down.

398
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,174
She does the work of our Lord,
the son of God".

399
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:09,171
Jesus.

400
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:13,541
- Oh my God!
- (tires screech)

401
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:18,274
It's just...
(whimpering)

402
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,028
Wow. It's a fantastic piece
of workmanship.

403
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:28,065
Real American primitive.

404
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:30,200
It's hideous.

405
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:33,671
- It's a blasphemy. Throw it out.
- No, the police will want to see this.

406
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:36,306
- Why?
- I don't know. Evidence, maybe.

407
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:39,044
Just throw it out!
Will you do that for me?

408
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,608
Just throw it out.
I don't want it in the car.

409
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:45,148
All right. I'll tell you what...
we'll put it all in the back for now.

410
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:47,485
As soon as we see the cops,
we give 'em everything...

411
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:50,821
the body, the whole works.
And we'll be done with it, all right?

412
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:53,489
Do what you want, okay?

413
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:00,931
You will, anyway.

414
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,612
Boy preacher:
Behold...

415
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:16,683
a dream that come to me
in the night.

416
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:19,386
And in my dream
the Lord was a shadow

417
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:22,156
that walked behind the rows.

418
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:25,859
And God spoke to me as He has
spoken to our older brothers

419
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,530
since we children started
making sacrifice.

420
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:32,466
Praise God.
Praise the Lord.

421
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:35,270
And God told me all
that has happened since.

422
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:36,971
God said to me,

423
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:40,974
"Joseph will take his things
and flee this happy place

424
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:44,012
because the fear of me
is no more upon him.

425
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,683
So take of his life
in punishment, not sacrifice.

426
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,153
Let not his flesh pollute the corn,

427
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:52,555
but cast his body upon the road.

428
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:54,991
So thus evermore will Joseph,

429
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:57,059
the betrayer of the corn,

430
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,330
be known as Ahaz, cursed of God".

431
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:04,100
Yea, so it is, Joseph, the unbeliever.

432
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:06,737
Yea, Ahaz be cursed.

433
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:08,772
And the Lord did say,

434
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:12,375
"I will send outlanders among you...
a man and a woman...

435
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:17,114
and these unbelievers will be
profaners and defilers of the corn.

436
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:20,384
Then shall your faith be tested
as it was in the days of the blue man".

437
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,887
- [All]: The blue man.
- The blue man.

438
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,383
Yea, the blue man.

439
00:29:26,258 --> 00:29:30,195
He Who Walks Behind The Rows
has protected us from the outside world

440
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:34,066
and provided for us since
the oldest amongst us were little.

441
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:37,135
But a time of tribulation has come.

442
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:39,371
A test is at hand!

443
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,771
We welcome the test.

444
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:43,710
You should not show pride,
Malachai.

445
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:46,845
For does not the Bible say that the Lord
will not lift up his countenance

446
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:49,776
upon the prideful man?

447
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,952
What did God say we must do?

448
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:57,557
God told me, "Be not like
Ahaz's fate to desert him,

449
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,462
for My name is strong here,
My power is great.

450
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:02,562
I'm the Lord of lords,

451
00:30:02,563 --> 00:30:04,932
so now you must make
sacrifices to me

452
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:09,033
and behold the unbelievers
who've come to fulfill this purpose".

453
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:12,440
Make sacrifice.

454
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,901
Yea!

455
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:19,079
Thus shall it be with the outlanders.

456
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,050
This is the word
of He Who Walks Behind The Rows.

457
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:24,820
We do His work
from shine to shadow.

458
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,489
It is well we do this.

459
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,526
- Yea, verily.
- Amen.

460
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,260
(girl laughs)

461
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,670
- [Vicky]: Do you smell that?
- Yeah.

462
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,471
What stinks?

463
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,476
You were obviously never
a farmer's daughter.

464
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:50,305
It's fertilizer. It's the stuff
that makes corn grow green.

465
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:32,393
- (fly buzzing)
- [Vicky]: Just stop right here.

466
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:34,559
Stop.

467
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:45,440
(whimpers)

468
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:49,077
Let's turn around, Burt. Let's just take
the body back to Grand Island.

469
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:51,647
No. Grand Island is 70 miles away
in the wrong direction.

470
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:53,682
It would look funny
if we brought him there.

471
00:31:53,683 --> 00:31:55,717
I don't care.

472
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:57,986
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean, "What's wrong?"

473
00:31:57,987 --> 00:32:00,423
This town is empty.
There's nobody here but us.

474
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:02,925
Yeah, it sure seems that way.

475
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:05,595
It's a one-stoplight town, I agree
with you, but everybody's probably down

476
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:08,465
at the town square
having a bake sale or something.

477
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:11,134
There's no one here.

478
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:13,605
- Do you remember that gas station?
- Yeah, what about it?

479
00:32:13,606 --> 00:32:18,543
When was the last time you paid
35.9¢ for gas in this country?

480
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:20,978
The '60s, maybe.

481
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,981
We're in the middle of town
and I haven't seen one car moving...

482
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,375
not one car!

483
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,623
Where are you...
where are you going?

484
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,191
I'm gonna go pull
that hair out of your ass.

485
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:36,593
I'm gonna go see where everybody is.
The sign says "Open". I'm going in.

486
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:39,998
And you're just gonna leave me
alone in the car again, huh?

487
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,502
You said you wanted
an early lunch stop. Congratulations.

488
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,506
You've got it. And no talking about
what happened to the boy, all right?

489
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,743
Huh. If you think so.

490
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:53,512
I do. So...

491
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,805
join me?

492
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:12,767
You've got
a busted headlight, mister.

493
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:16,037
Blood on it, too. Maybe you hit
a dog or something.

494
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,039
(whimpers)

495
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,638
Hmm?

496
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:23,479
(whispers)
Look,

497
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,348
- do you hear it?
- Hear what?

498
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,952
The nothing. There are no cars.
There are no people.

499
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:31,587
There are no fertilizer spreaders.
There's nothing here.

500
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:34,880
(distant children playing)

501
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:40,788
I hear kids, don't you?

502
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,833
(creaks)

503
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,126
(whimpers)

504
00:33:48,204 --> 00:33:50,337
(flies buzzing)

505
00:34:17,037 --> 00:34:20,101
(buzzing continues)

506
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:26,206
Pardon me, sir. Can I try some
of your 25c sweet potato pie?

507
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,327
I've been at that
bake sale or football game

508
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,324
for 12 years now.

509
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:50,872
I can't make sense of this.
I'm sure there's people here.

510
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,874
You know what?
That's what's wrong with you.

511
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,644
You're always sure.
You spent your whole life being sure.

512
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:59,415
Why do you have to be so stubborn?
Why can't you just admit

513
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:02,742
that there's something wrong here?
The whole place stinks of it.

514
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:09,616
(Vicky panting)

515
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:12,562
(softly)
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:15,497
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um...

517
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:18,401
Why don't we just go find
some local authorities

518
00:35:18,402 --> 00:35:21,397
and report this accident?

519
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:24,475
Okay?

520
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:26,178
No.

521
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,913
- What?
- No.

522
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:31,449
There, I said it. No!

523
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,652
And in a nutshell, why our entire
marriage is falling apart, Burt.

524
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:36,621
I said, "No!" No, sir!

525
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:38,890
- Just give it a rest.
- I'll give it a rest

526
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:40,593
when we're going
the other way, okay?

527
00:35:40,594 --> 00:35:42,994
Now turn this car around.
Turn it around right now.

528
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:45,931
- Let's go and see that lawyer.
- We have a dead child

529
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:49,101
in the trunk of our car.
If you wanna go back to I-80

530
00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:52,170
and walk, that's fine.
I'll pick you up later.

531
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,041
But do not tell me to drive
70 miles backwards

532
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:57,844
and act like we have nothing
but a bag of garbage in our trunk.

533
00:35:57,845 --> 00:36:00,612
This kid was
some mother's son, Vicky!

534
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:03,349
So, I'm gonna find whatever
local justice they have around here

535
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,587
and report it before whoever killed him
is over the hills and far away!

536
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:09,456
- Is that fine by you?
- Yes, sir. Yes, captain, sir.

537
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:12,158
I forgot we were back
at Lon Dong or Dung Ho,

538
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,796
wherever it was
that you won the war.

539
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,497
It must have been
the Cong, sir.

540
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:18,532
Why don't we go back in there,
burn a few hooches

541
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:22,861
- and rape a few grandmothers, huh?
- Why don't you stop talking for awhile?

542
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:26,374
And put that down.

543
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,343
- Put it down!
- Tsk.

544
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:31,847
You play your games,
and I'll play mine, huh?

545
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:36,285
Oh, of course.
That's always the way you play it.

546
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:40,215
Let's remember we've got
a prom queen to take care of here.

547
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,250
(woofs)

548
00:36:58,643 --> 00:37:01,011
David.

549
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,782
Get Mark and meet me
at the church.

550
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:07,381
Do not let
the outlanders escape.

551
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:12,516
I'll get us some
bailing wire then.

552
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,963
[Ben]: People gotta come
to Gatlin all the time.

553
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:21,768
There must be people who have
friends and relatives here

554
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:24,935
and delivery trucks
that come from the outside.

555
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,808
Not to mention the people just
passing through, like you and me.

556
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:31,444
I mean, some of them have to
have noticed something.

557
00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:34,613
Certain things can't happen...
not in the '70s.

558
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:37,584
Whole towns don't just shut down.
What about the state patrol?

559
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:39,718
They must cruise through
from time to time.

560
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,588
The power company, huh?

561
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:44,024
Don't you think the power company
would've noticed

562
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:47,128
the electricity had been shut off
for 12 long years?

563
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:50,261
The stoplight is dead.

564
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,251
You see that sermon board?

565
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:23,433
That's last Sunday.

566
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,601
Something's happened in this town...

567
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,605
something wrong.

568
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,272
In a crisis,
they all collect at the church.

569
00:38:32,211 --> 00:38:35,312
- "He Who Walks Behind The Rows"?
- Yeah.

570
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,812
Just one of 9,000 different names
for God in Nebraska, I guess.

571
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,789
I'm gonna go take a look.
Join me?

572
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,192
I'm not going in there with you.

573
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:50,087
Fine. Do whatever you want.

574
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,300
I haven't been in a church
since I was a kid.

575
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:56,902
I don't wanna be in this church,
I don't wanna be in this town

576
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,205
and can we just go?!

577
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:01,906
I'm just gonna go in
for 10 minutes tops.

578
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,643
I'll be right back out.

579
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:12,151
Okay. That's the deal...
10 minutes.

580
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:15,188
I've got my keys.

581
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:18,116
If you're not back out here,
I'm gonna drive away.

582
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:21,829
All right.
No more games.

583
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,900
I'm gonna tell you that once...
no more games.

584
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:29,237
No games.
10 minutes,

585
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:32,240
and then little old Vicky Jean is
gonna put on her boogie shoes.

586
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:35,010
I don't think so.

587
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,447
What are you gonna do? Hmm?

588
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:41,583
- Are you gonna assault me? Hmm?
- No.

589
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:44,487
Is that what you're gonna do?
Just mug me, take my keys?

590
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:47,223
- No, but you think that I would.
- Yeah.

591
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:49,092
I think you're
just about capable of that.

592
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:51,361
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,431
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag!
- Give it to me, you son of a bitch!

594
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:57,167
Give me my purse!
Give it to...

595
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:59,536
- my... give me my purse!
- Give me... give me the bag!

596
00:39:59,537 --> 00:40:01,430
(sobs)

597
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,978
Oh, look who has
all the coins in Nebraska.

598
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:11,949
You did not have to do that.

599
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,353
Is that what your sarge
taught you out in the jungle...

600
00:40:15,354 --> 00:40:18,790
along with how to cut gook tits off
and make moccasins out of them

601
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,026
in 20 seconds?

602
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,597
- Just give them back to me.
- No.

603
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:27,466
No.

604
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:31,571
You'd wait two minutes and decide that
that's long enough. No.

605
00:40:31,572 --> 00:40:33,674
- No, I wouldn't.
- Yeah! Yeah, you would.

606
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,541
Then, you'd drive off
laughing, saying,

607
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:38,678
"That'll teach that SOB Burt
to mess with the ex-prom queen

608
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,848
when she wants something".
That's been your whole thesis as a wife,

609
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:45,879
hasn't it, Vicky?
"That'll teach Burt to mess with me".

610
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:57,130
It's a second honeymoon, huh?

611
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:59,832
That's a laugh.

612
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:03,003
That I still feel something for you...

613
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:08,139
if it means anything... I think.

614
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,451
It's okay. You can say it...

615
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,519
that you hate my guts.

616
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,091
You hate my guts, and you've...
you've hated them for years.

617
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,526
No. There's no hate.

618
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:27,697
I don't hate. I...

619
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:30,990
I feel responsibility.

620
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:35,037
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

621
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:39,640
No. I don't think that you do.

622
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,848
I'm gonna go in now.

623
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:47,518
Lock all the doors
and roll up the windows.

624
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,491
Look, let's just get out of town
and find a phone booth, okay?

625
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:55,827
- I've got change.
- I'm sick and tired of your tantrums.

626
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:58,964
This is not a tantrum.
There is something wrong here.

627
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:01,359
(softly)
I can feel it.

628
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,739
Please.

629
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,009
Please. Please.

630
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,479
- No, not this time.
- Please.

631
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,182
I'm not letting you push
my buttons anymore.

632
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:18,219
Please.

633
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,487
(sobs)
Burt, don't leave me in here.

634
00:42:20,488 --> 00:42:22,590
Burt!

635
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,791
Burt, come back here!
Burt, please!

636
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:29,297
Son of a bitch!

637
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,030
Burt, please!
We've gotta get out of here!

638
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:32,934
We've gotta
get out of here!

639
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:34,936
Burt!

640
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,738
Come on, we've gotta get outta here.
We've gotta get outta here.

641
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:39,330
Please!

642
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:59,527
(creaks)

643
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,725
(loudly)
Hello?

644
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,961
Anyone here?

645
00:43:31,164 --> 00:43:33,265
Why are the adults sinners,
Malachai?

646
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:34,767
'Cause God said so.

647
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,969
Does God speak to you
and tell you this, Malachai?

648
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,407
No. He only speaks to Isaac.

649
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:42,542
But on this matter
he has spoken.

650
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:44,310
We must sacrifice
the adult sinners

651
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:48,615
to protect ourselves from
the outside world. This is our test.

652
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:52,310
- [All]: The will of God be done. Amen.
- The will of God be done. Amen.

653
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:48,968
(change clinking)

654
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,657
(sighs)

655
00:45:32,226 --> 00:45:35,921
Tsk. Damn you, Burt.

656
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:52,303
Who's there?

657
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:55,017
I know there's...

658
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,788
I know there's somebody there.
I can hear you.

659
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,557
(faint whispering)

660
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,023
Stop playing games.

661
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,563
Stop playing games!

662
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,155
(whispering grows louder)

663
00:46:28,354 --> 00:46:30,555
(whimpers)
Who are you?

664
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:32,953
We are your destiny.

665
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:50,076
Malachai,
what about the man?

666
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:53,704
God has provided
the woman first.

667
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:03,314
Burt. Burt!

668
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,871
(honking)

669
00:47:24,948 --> 00:47:28,108
(honking continues)

670
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,750
Burt!

671
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:37,560
- Burt!
- (honking continues)

672
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:41,231
"Then the Lord answered Job
out of the whirlwind, and said,

673
00:47:41,232 --> 00:47:45,825
'Who is this that darkeneth counsel
by words without knowledge?"'

674
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:50,333
And please pass the corn.

675
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,858
(pants)

676
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:27,270
(pants)

677
00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:32,653
What do you want?

678
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:35,022
Do you want the body
so you can cover it up?

679
00:48:35,023 --> 00:48:36,757
It's in the trunk, okay?
Just take it. Take it!

680
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:39,860
We don't want his body, sister.

681
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:41,762
(sobs)

682
00:48:41,763 --> 00:48:44,265
I'm not your sister!

683
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:46,634
We've come to give you peace.

684
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,002
No. No.

685
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:52,073
Burt! Burt!

686
00:48:52,074 --> 00:48:55,471
- (shrieks) Burt!
- (children clamor)

687
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:16,732
(Vicky screaming) Burt!

688
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:19,570
- (honking)
- Help me!

689
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:22,763
- Help me!
- (clamoring)

690
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:25,710
Help me. Help me.
Help me. Help me.

691
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:28,546
Burt. Ah-hh.

692
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,978
(sobs)

693
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:36,420
(gasps)

694
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:38,690
(clamoring continues)

695
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:41,759
- Burt!
- (screeching)

696
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:21,159
(gasps)

697
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:25,971
Burt!

698
00:50:41,024 --> 00:50:44,650
Ah! Look at me!

699
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:49,166
- (sobs)
- Would you like to pray?

700
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:50,234
Pray?

701
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:54,138
The time for forgiveness has come
to an end for you, woman.

702
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:57,107
The time of judgment
is now at hand.

703
00:50:57,108 --> 00:51:01,042
- (panting)
- Hell yawns beneath you!

704
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:06,680
- Say your own prayers, brother!
- (grunts)

705
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:09,954
(gunshot)

706
00:51:09,955 --> 00:51:12,648
- (children screaming)
- (Vicky screams)

707
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:20,691
(groans)

708
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,675
Help me, Burt.
Help me, help me.

709
00:51:27,676 --> 00:51:31,642
(sobbing)

710
00:51:40,989 --> 00:51:44,957
- (screams)
- (knife zings)

711
00:51:48,096 --> 00:51:51,096
Hey! Stop!

712
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:55,705
Vicky!
(pants)

713
00:51:55,706 --> 00:51:58,603
Don't. My wife's in there.

714
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,668
No more, brother.

715
00:52:07,516 --> 00:52:09,983
No!

716
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,425
(children scream)

717
00:52:28,773 --> 00:52:32,900
Where is she?
Where have you taken her?

718
00:52:34,712 --> 00:52:37,248
So you've killed her?

719
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:40,417
The time of sacrifice is at hand.

720
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:44,285
Sacrifice? Sacrifice?

721
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,038
(children chanting)
Kill kill kill

722
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,976
- kill kill kill kill.
- Kill him!

723
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:36,345
Kill kill kill kill kill!

724
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,580
Kill kill.

725
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:41,011
- No!
- (grunts)

726
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,822
My name is Isaac, chosen by
He Who Walks Behinds The Rows,

727
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,518
seer and prophet,
guardian of the corn!

728
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:54,254
Let my aim be true
if it is thy will!

729
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:58,125
(grunts)

730
00:53:59,204 --> 00:54:02,939
You little bastard.
You little bastard!

731
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,843
You are a sinner.
You are a defiler of the corn.

732
00:54:05,844 --> 00:54:08,244
It will do you no good
to curse me.

733
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,948
Bow to God's will.

734
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:12,685
What have you done with my wife?

735
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:14,753
Is she dead?

736
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:17,756
So it was that
the will of God be done.

737
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:19,423
Oh, so you enjoyed it.

738
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:23,290
The Lord loveth a cheerful heart
and a glad countenance.

739
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:31,434
Watch, all of you!

740
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:35,906
(groans softly)

741
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,583
(gasps)

742
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:44,585
(knife clatters)

743
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:47,988
You better have more than kitchen knives
and screwdrivers, kiddies.

744
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:51,757
You'd better find a flamethrower.
This is my game.

745
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:55,029
I've played it before
on better courts than yours.

746
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,665
The Lord is not mocked.

747
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,636
Neither am I, sonny.

748
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,203
Neither am I.
(chuckles)

749
00:55:02,204 --> 00:55:05,406
I'm leaving now.
I'm gonna go find some people

750
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:07,811
and tell them about
what's happening here in Gatlin.

751
00:55:07,812 --> 00:55:09,512
I don't think
they'll believe me at first...

752
00:55:09,513 --> 00:55:11,348
I don't think I believe it myself...

753
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,314
but they will, eventually.

754
00:55:15,251 --> 00:55:18,787
You guys all belong in an asylum
somewhere... a loony bin.

755
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:22,425
Where are your parents?

756
00:55:22,426 --> 00:55:26,963
I asked you a question!
Where are your parents?!

757
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:30,033
In the corn.

758
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,802
What does that even mean?

759
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:36,807
What have you done?
What's happened here?

760
00:55:36,808 --> 00:55:38,609
Remand your soul to God,

761
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,778
for you will stand before
His throne momentarily.

762
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:44,883
- (murmuring)
- I can take you, boy.

763
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:48,044
Don't make me prove it.

764
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:58,163
God is my strength.

765
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:01,565
That's what they told us
in the Marines.

766
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:07,373
Kill him! Kill him!

767
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:10,101
(grunts)

768
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:16,573
(choking)

769
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:28,596
How do you like it?

770
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:30,898
It's unwise to mess with a guy
who spent three years

771
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:33,235
- on jungle patrol.
- (murmuring)

772
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:38,101
Why don't you put that
in your god and smoke it?

773
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:42,941
I'm gonna blow the whistle
so hard when I get back.

774
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:48,384
- [Malachai]: Kill the outlander!
- (children yelling)

775
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:50,418
Kill him!

776
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,900
- Kill the outlander!
- Kill him!

777
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:08,301
Kill kill kill kill kill!

778
00:57:17,249 --> 00:57:20,283
(children shouting)

779
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:24,679
(shouting continues)

780
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:48,175
- [All]: Ah!
- Ah!

781
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:51,650
Whoa.

782
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:57,014
(panting)

783
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:06,702
- What do we do now?
- I'm not going in there.

784
00:58:06,703 --> 00:58:08,437
- Not without Malachai and Isaac.
- Me neither.

785
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:11,973
- I can't...
- (murmuring)

786
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:29,058
- The Lord is displeased with us.
- Why?

787
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:33,230
First Ahaz,
his blood was spilled in the corn.

788
00:58:33,231 --> 00:58:35,265
Then the man and the woman came.

789
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:37,000
They both killed.

790
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:39,703
- The man still runs free.
- They will catch him.

791
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:42,506
It doesn't matter if they do or not.
The Lord guided my aim...

792
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:45,175
and not into his heart,
only into his arm.

793
00:58:45,176 --> 00:58:48,613
And he took the knife and broke it...
broken in two.

794
00:58:48,614 --> 00:58:51,082
It was a sign.

795
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:52,650
A sign from a sinner?

796
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:55,520
The clay knows not
the potter's work.

797
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:57,689
All things do the work of God...

798
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,993
even the sinners,
though they not know it.

799
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:04,264
The outlander broke our knives.
We broke our covenant with God

800
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:06,866
when you spilled
Ahaz's blood in the corn.

801
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:10,336
But he... Joseph was...
Ahaz was running away.

802
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:12,004
Your faith weakened.

803
00:59:12,005 --> 00:59:15,875
You've led the biggest boys
for three years now.

804
00:59:15,876 --> 00:59:18,912
Perhaps you've gotten prideful...

805
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:22,916
and this is your punishment.

806
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:25,819
He Who Walks Behind The Rows
is a jealous God.

807
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,189
He was old
when Jesus was unborn.

808
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,492
He is a god of favor, but He's
a god of sacrifice as well.

809
00:59:31,493 --> 00:59:34,962
- But, Isaac...
- But He's a god of sacrifice as well!

810
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:38,399
For what other reason has He allowed
us to survive unseen and unnoticed

811
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,137
all these years while the world
outside grows more wicked?

812
00:59:42,138 --> 00:59:44,440
You are old enough to remember
the time of the drought

813
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:46,643
before He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

814
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:50,302
But now there's rain and corn,
and everything is good.

815
00:59:50,747 --> 00:59:54,850
When God speaks to me, Malachai,
will you accept his will?

816
00:59:54,851 --> 00:59:58,114
Yes, Isaac.

817
00:59:58,989 --> 01:00:03,356
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

818
01:00:04,695 --> 01:00:08,059
Then let us pray.

819
01:00:10,835 --> 01:00:13,571
The outlander is in God's hands.

820
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:16,474
You must give chase
until his time.

821
01:00:16,475 --> 01:00:18,442
Like the blue man?

822
01:00:18,443 --> 01:00:21,671
Yes, like the blue man.

823
01:00:36,562 --> 01:00:40,155
(children murmuring)

824
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,716
There's an outlander in the corn...

825
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:58,086
an unbeliever, like the blue man.

826
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:01,121
Children:
The blue man, yea.

827
01:01:01,122 --> 01:01:04,392
The outlander must be chased
to the clearing of the blue man.

828
01:01:04,393 --> 01:01:06,628
There he'll be taken in sacrifice.

829
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:10,064
Only then will the covenant
be restored.

830
01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:12,667
This is the word of God.

831
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:15,303
First, we'll sing our praise
to the Lord.

832
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,674
- Will you lead us in hymn?
- Yes, Isaac.

833
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,744
- Hallelujah!
- [Children]: Hallelujah!

834
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:25,347
¶ Sowing in the morning ¶

835
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,782
¶ Sowing seeds of kindness ¶

836
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:31,855
¶ Sowing in the noontide
and the dewy eve ¶

837
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:36,459
¶ Waiting for the harvest
and the time of reaping ¶

838
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,197
¶ We shall come rejoicing,
bringing in the sheaves ¶

839
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:45,001
¶ Bringing in the sheaves,
bringing in the sheaves... ¶

840
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,572
- Sing on, you little bastards.
- ¶¶ We shall come rejoicing ¶¶

841
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:49,607
- ¶¶ Bringing in the sheaves. ¶¶
- There he is! Over there!

842
01:01:49,608 --> 01:01:50,775
- (gasps)
- [Boys]: What?

843
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:54,106
- Go get him!
- (shouting)

844
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:03,313
(shouting continues)

845
01:02:05,692 --> 01:02:08,555
(panting)

846
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:25,205
(pants)

847
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:03,685
(pants)

848
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:35,546
[Boy]: I hear him!

849
01:03:45,764 --> 01:03:48,995
[Boy #2]:
Go go go go!

850
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:29,901
- Go go!
- Run run run run run!

851
01:04:44,429 --> 01:04:46,430
Boy:
I want to be the one who...

852
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:49,898
(Burt panting)

853
01:04:50,868 --> 01:04:53,937
(creaks)

854
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,319
(boys talking indistinctly)

855
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:27,274
[Boy]: Let me do it.
Let me do it. Let me do it!

856
01:05:27,275 --> 01:05:29,308
[Boy ¶2]: No.

857
01:05:32,547 --> 01:05:34,748
(talking continues)

858
01:05:34,749 --> 01:05:38,216
(steps approaching)

859
01:05:46,194 --> 01:05:49,162
Naham.

860
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:53,268
- Naham!
- I saw His shadow. I saw it.

861
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:56,238
The man? Where?

862
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:59,241
Not him, He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

863
01:05:59,242 --> 01:06:02,544
- That's blasphemy.
- But, Malachai, I did.

864
01:06:02,545 --> 01:06:05,409
I saw His shadow.

865
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:10,887
I was back there,
walking up the row,

866
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:13,522
Looking for the sinner
or more of his footprints.

867
01:06:13,523 --> 01:06:17,261
Only I didn't see any footprints because
the ground was all hard and powdery.

868
01:06:17,262 --> 01:06:20,397
- I know.
- And all of a sudden it got darker

869
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:22,366
on my one side
and I looked over

870
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:25,168
and it was like the sun
was out on that side.

871
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:27,505
I could hear something
walking, breathing,

872
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:29,274
and the shadow
came up on the corn.

873
01:06:29,275 --> 01:06:31,942
I couldn't catch my breath.

874
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:33,946
I thought He was coming for me

875
01:06:33,947 --> 01:06:37,682
because Joseph...
I mean, Ahaz... was my friend.

876
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:41,919
It was He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

877
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,183
He passed right by me.

878
01:06:46,558 --> 01:06:49,458
You had a vision, Naham.

879
01:06:49,864 --> 01:06:53,032
You're very lucky, if it's true.

880
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:57,263
I swear it. I swear it is.

881
01:06:58,805 --> 01:07:01,141
You may be the next prophet

882
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,210
once Isaac reaches
the age of favor.

883
01:07:03,211 --> 01:07:07,474
- I don't wanna be a prophet.
- Do not blaspheme, Naham!

884
01:07:11,753 --> 01:07:14,719
by the sun.

885
01:07:17,493 --> 01:07:18,961
Yes, it is.

886
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:22,397
We won't stay in the corn after dark
if we don't find the man,

887
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:25,099
- will we?
- We will find him.

888
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,372
- But if we don't?
- We never stay in the corn after dark.

889
01:07:29,373 --> 01:07:32,340
You know it's not wise.

890
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:35,577
Because of... Him?

891
01:07:35,578 --> 01:07:40,215
- Yes, because of Him.
- He's very old, isn't He?

892
01:07:40,216 --> 01:07:42,986
Yes, very old,

893
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:45,680
and the night is His time.

894
01:07:58,302 --> 01:08:01,997
- You go that way. I'll go that way.
- Wait, I hear him.

895
01:08:05,444 --> 01:08:08,979
(panting)

896
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:31,501
(men speaking Vietnamese)

897
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,406
(shouting in Vietnamese)

898
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,460
Hey, this is my row.

899
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:55,764
No, Peter and I were here first.

900
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:58,356
He's right, Amos.

901
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:10,267
(speaking Vietnamese)

902
01:09:16,787 --> 01:09:18,287
(speaks Vietnamese)

903
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:22,450
(guns firing)

904
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:35,762
(firing continues)

905
01:09:36,774 --> 01:09:38,976
(gasps)

906
01:09:38,977 --> 01:09:41,712
I see him! I see him!
It's the sinner!

907
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:43,915
- He's here! He's here! He's here!
- Shh.

908
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:47,918
- (muffled shouting)
- (shouting)

909
01:09:50,356 --> 01:09:52,559
(grunts)

910
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,787
- (neck cracks)
- (Burt groans)

911
01:09:56,896 --> 01:10:00,057
(children speaking loudly)

912
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:13,569
(rocket roars)

913
01:10:18,286 --> 01:10:20,548
Okay.

914
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,006
(firing continues)

915
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,790
(rockets roars, explodes)

916
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:57,794
(panting)

917
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,385
(blood sloshing)

918
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:20,652
Come on!

919
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:24,246
- Come on! (echoes)
- (bell ringing)

920
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:07,125
They're back!

921
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:11,139
(murmuring)

922
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:16,707
Take these to the others.

923
01:12:18,782 --> 01:12:21,749
It's Amos.

924
01:12:25,056 --> 01:12:27,748
(coos)

925
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:32,627
(murmuring continues)

926
01:13:12,573 --> 01:13:15,471
- (rips)
- (groans)

927
01:13:21,949 --> 01:13:25,541
(murmuring)

928
01:13:33,227 --> 01:13:34,929
(bangs)

929
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:38,227
Let us pray.

930
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:44,473
(laughing softly)

931
01:13:44,474 --> 01:13:45,941
(whispers)
Shut up.

932
01:13:45,942 --> 01:13:49,170
(giggles softly)

933
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,191
(crickets chirping)

934
01:14:21,314 --> 01:14:24,750
- (coos)
- [Isaac]: "Be fruitful and multiply

935
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:29,488
as the corn multiplies, that my favor
be shewn you and be upon you.

936
01:14:29,489 --> 01:14:32,525
Dear God, we beg
thy blessing on the crop.

937
01:14:32,526 --> 01:14:34,693
In the name of He Who Walks
Behind The Rows".

938
01:14:34,694 --> 01:14:36,763
- [All]: Amen.
- Amen.

939
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,888
The time of fertilization
has come.

940
01:15:05,528 --> 01:15:08,493
(rustling)

941
01:16:06,392 --> 01:16:09,722
(gasps, pants)

942
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:12,892
Oh shit.

943
01:16:17,838 --> 01:16:20,338
(moaning)

944
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:35,122
Dead!
(shouting)

945
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,091
Ah! God!

946
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,719
(moaning)

947
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:45,895
God! Ah!

948
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,501
(shouting continues)

949
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,246
(screaming)

950
01:16:56,247 --> 01:16:58,370
(shouting)

951
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:37,420
(static screeching)

952
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:46,398
He's here! It's the sinner!
It's the sinner!

953
01:17:46,999 --> 01:17:49,803
God is my strength.

954
01:17:49,804 --> 01:17:53,134
It was He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

955
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:59,079
[Children]: The blue man.
Yea, the blue man.

956
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,984
(Vicky screams)

957
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:05,951
(panting)

958
01:18:11,193 --> 01:18:13,894
It's due west
back to the highway, right?

959
01:18:13,895 --> 01:18:16,157
Right.

960
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,005
I'll hitch a ride.

961
01:18:23,006 --> 01:18:25,573
I'll make
some phone calls.

962
01:18:25,574 --> 01:18:27,576
(rustles)

963
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:31,341
Which way is it
back to the road?

964
01:18:32,182 --> 01:18:36,013
Okay, I can go west by the stars.

965
01:18:36,653 --> 01:18:38,421
I went on 61 patrols.

966
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,257
- (rustles, creaks)
- I came back from every one of 'em.

967
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:43,060
(rustles)

968
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:44,728
(sniffs)

969
01:18:44,729 --> 01:18:46,296
'Cause I've got
a compass in my head.

970
01:18:46,297 --> 01:18:49,400
I'm gonna get out.
I'm gonna get outta here.

971
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:51,368
(rustles)

972
01:18:51,369 --> 01:18:54,370
- Stop talking to yourself.
- (rustles)

973
01:18:54,371 --> 01:18:56,634
Stop talking to yourself.

974
01:19:28,076 --> 01:19:30,371
(swishes)

975
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:38,110
(panting)

976
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:02,141
- (crackles)
- (grunts)

977
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:29,238
(creaking)

978
01:20:31,977 --> 01:20:34,570
(crackling)

979
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:46,058
(crackling continues)

980
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:48,650
(groans)

981
01:20:53,534 --> 01:20:56,329
(groans)

982
01:20:57,671 --> 01:21:01,503
- (rustles)
- (knife clangs)

983
01:21:31,008 --> 01:21:32,740
(sighs)

984
01:21:32,741 --> 01:21:35,044
(whispers)
Oh my God.

985
01:21:35,045 --> 01:21:36,946
Oh my God!

986
01:21:36,947 --> 01:21:39,515
(wheezes)
Oh my God.

987
01:21:39,516 --> 01:21:43,348
Vicky. Vicky.

988
01:21:56,168 --> 01:21:59,566
(crackling)

989
01:22:00,272 --> 01:22:01,839
Who's there?

990
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,432
- Who's there?!
- (crackling continues)

991
01:22:06,144 --> 01:22:09,047
Come out where I can see you,
you black pajama'd bastards!

992
01:22:09,048 --> 01:22:13,209
(rustling, crackling)

993
01:22:13,786 --> 01:22:18,049
Come out here!
Come out here and look at me!

994
01:22:19,926 --> 01:22:23,519
(louder, faster rustling)

995
01:22:43,952 --> 01:22:46,454
Hey, Burt.

996
01:22:46,455 --> 01:22:50,558
Come on, it's not so bad.

997
01:22:50,559 --> 01:22:53,562
Being sacrificed by devil
pagan children in the corn...

998
01:22:53,563 --> 01:22:56,756
- it's not so bad.
- (static screeching)

999
01:22:58,034 --> 01:23:00,702
Having your eyes ripped
out of your skull,

1000
01:23:00,703 --> 01:23:02,404
- according to the laws of Moses...
- (grunts)

1001
01:23:02,405 --> 01:23:04,807
it's not so bad.

1002
01:23:04,808 --> 01:23:06,976
- (man screams)
- It's all right.

1003
01:23:06,977 --> 01:23:08,978
- Join me?
- (thunders)

1004
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:11,814
(shouts)

1005
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:14,747
(knife clangs)

1006
01:23:23,327 --> 01:23:25,624
(buzzes)

1007
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:30,200
Last night, He Who Walks Behind
The Rows spoke to me in a dream,

1008
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:32,937
and I did fall down
upon my knees in fright

1009
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:37,275
and hide my eyes lest the terror
of His face strike me dead.

1010
01:23:37,276 --> 01:23:42,313
He is much displeased
with this sacrifice.

1011
01:23:43,682 --> 01:23:47,387
And the Lord did say, "Have I not
given you this place of killing

1012
01:23:47,388 --> 01:23:49,355
so that you might make
sacrifice here?

1013
01:23:49,356 --> 01:23:52,257
Have I not shewn you favor?

1014
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:54,059
But I did give you a test.

1015
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:57,463
Two outlanders did come...
a man and a woman.

1016
01:23:57,464 --> 01:23:59,966
But this man has made
a blasphemy within me

1017
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:02,502
and did cause confusion
among you.

1018
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:05,333
This man was strong
in his evil.

1019
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,975
And so then I've completed
this sacrifice myself

1020
01:24:08,976 --> 01:24:11,811
Like the blue man who tried
to escape many years ago".

1021
01:24:11,812 --> 01:24:14,483
The blue man.
Yea, the blue man.

1022
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:17,917
"And so now
the age of favor is lowered

1023
01:24:17,918 --> 01:24:20,221
from 19 planting harvests to 18.

1024
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:24,058
Each and every one of you
will walk into the corn at dusk

1025
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,294
upon your 18th birthday

1026
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:30,098
and He Who Walks Behind
The Rows will find you,

1027
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:32,067
and you will walk with Him".

1028
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:35,398
So the Lord told me.

1029
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:46,845
I obey the word of God.

1030
01:24:50,387 --> 01:24:53,490
- Praise God!
- [All]: Praise God.

1031
01:24:53,491 --> 01:24:57,194
May the favor of He Who Walks
Behind The Rows be shewn

1032
01:24:57,195 --> 01:25:00,628
- and be upon you.
- Amen.

1033
01:25:54,724 --> 01:25:57,916
Scarecrow!

1034
01:29:24,046 --> 01:29:27,639
(steps approaching)

1035
01:29:58,884 --> 01:30:01,715
Never mind.

1036
01:30:02,488 --> 01:30:04,188
If it is God's will,

1037
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:08,851
the children will continue on
as always, Ruth.

1038
01:30:09,397 --> 01:30:12,898
If it's God's will, yes.

1039
01:30:13,467 --> 01:30:15,168
Then why do you fear?

1040
01:30:15,169 --> 01:30:17,871
- I fear nothing.
- Please, Malachai.

1041
01:30:17,872 --> 01:30:19,773
I obey the will of God.

1042
01:30:19,774 --> 01:30:23,477
My birthday will come
in October after the harvest.

1043
01:30:23,478 --> 01:30:26,347
I barely lose one month.

1044
01:30:26,348 --> 01:30:29,551
Amos is losing almost
his entire 18th year.

1045
01:30:29,552 --> 01:30:33,354
If this is the will of God,
I wish there were no God!

1046
01:30:33,355 --> 01:30:36,321
Do not blaspheme!

1047
01:30:46,702 --> 01:30:50,139
Have a fine son, Ruth,

1048
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:53,799
and raise him to love religion
and to hate the world.

1049
01:30:57,881 --> 01:31:00,349
Promise me.

1050
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:03,714
I... I can't.

1051
01:31:23,677 --> 01:31:26,869
Amos:
It's night now.

1052
01:31:28,982 --> 01:31:31,811
His time.

1053
01:31:32,452 --> 01:31:35,680
I know, Amos.

1054
01:31:38,525 --> 01:31:41,822
(sobs)
Goodbye, Malachai.
