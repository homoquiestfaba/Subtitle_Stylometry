1
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,858
Taqi.

2
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,161
It hurts.

3
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,999
It's Apuna!
Can you hear me?

4
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,265
Apuna?

5
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,465
Yes.

6
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,506
He stole it.

7
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,341
What?

8
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,703
He's crazy!

9
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,111
He stabbed me.

10
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,808
Can you stand?

11
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,551
- He stole it...
- What?

12
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,054
...so I took it.

13
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,521
What?

14
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,620
Don't let him have it.

15
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,424
What did he take?

16
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,688
My radio.

17
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,491
He stole it, but...

18
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,494
I took it back.

19
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,802
Hold on!

20
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,210
Miqu!

21
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,255
Miqu! What did you do?

22
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,632
Apuna!

23
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,171
Did I kill him?

24
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,679
Yes.

25
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,622
That's enough!

26
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,196
It wasn't my fault!

27
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,139
You saw it, right?

28
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,841
He was trying to kill me!

29
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,642
I saw it.

30
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,918
It's not my fault, right?

31
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,381
Get on. We'll go home now.

32
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,156
You crazy motherfucker!

33
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,357
Enough!

34
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,568
We're going home.

35
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,743
What are you going to do?

36
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,078
What are you going to tell them?

37
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,895
Stay away from there!

38
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,562
It's my sled!

39
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,708
We can't bring him back.

40
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,404
If we do, they're gonna take me.

41
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,112
We're not going to take him back!
Do you hear me?

42
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,913
Yes, I hear you.

43
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,081
What will you do?

44
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,419
I don't know.

45
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,478
We can say he fell through the ice.

46
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,058
Or a bear got him.

47
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,522
They won't believe you.

48
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,697
They will if you tell them.

49
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,829
There's a crack down that way.

50
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,730
I could take him there.

51
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,535
No one will know.

52
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,312
I fucked up.

53
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,981
Help me, Apuna!

54
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,216
You're my friend!

55
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,856
He has a son.

56
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,192
I'll raise him.
I have a son too.

57
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,027
I'll take care of him.

58
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,871
His son is like my nephew.

59
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,740
I'll teach him how to hunt.

60
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,744
I'm done with that!

61
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,225
If they send me to jail,
who's gonna raise my son?

62
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,593
Or his?

63
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,492
You?

64
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,596
That's what will happen
if you take him back.

65
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,868
They'll send me outside,
down South,

66
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,174
I'll never see my son again.

67
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,906
I'll never hunt again.

68
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,842
Don't take him back.

69
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,718
Take my sled!

70
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,697
And my dogs! Anything you want!

71
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,098
I said, stay away from there!

72
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,431
OK.

73
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,567
Let's take him off.
