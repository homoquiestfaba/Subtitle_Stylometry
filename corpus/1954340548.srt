1
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,720
<i>We're lucky to be in the city.</i>

2
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,156
<i>They say the war was terrible.</i>

3
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,259
<i>That the rest of</i>
<i>the world was destroyed.</i>

4
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,162
<i>Our founders built</i>
<i>the wall to keep us safe</i>

5
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,598
<i>and they divided us into</i>
<i>five groups, factions,</i>

6
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,167
<i>to keep the peace.</i>

7
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,739
<i>The smart ones,</i>
<i>the ones who value</i>
<i>knowledge and logic</i>

8
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,508
<i>are in erudite.</i>

9
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,411
<i>They know everything.</i>

10
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,948
<i>Amity farm the land.</i>

11
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,685
<i>They're all about</i>
<i>kindness and harmony,</i>
<i>always happy.</i>

12
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,291
<i>Candor value honesty and order.</i>

13
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,227
<i>They tell the truth,</i>
<i>even when you</i>
<i>wish they wouldn't.</i>

14
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,830
<i>And then there's dauntless.</i>

15
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:23,802
<i>They're our protectors,</i>
<i>our soldiers, our police.</i>

16
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,904
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>they were amazing.</i>

17
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,376
<i>Brave, fearless and free.</i>

18
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,714
<i>Some people think</i>
<i>dauntless are crazy,</i>

19
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,916
<i>which they kind of are.</i>

20
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,619
Come on, Beatrice.

21
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,654
<i>My faction is abnegation.</i>

22
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,356
<i>The others all</i>
<i>call us "stiffs."</i>

23
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,459
<i>We lead a simple life,</i>

24
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,662
<i>selfless,</i>
<i>dedicated to helping others.</i>

25
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,864
<i>We even feed the factionless,</i>

26
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,566
<i>the ones who</i>
<i>don't fit in anywhere.</i>

27
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,337
<i>Because we're public servants,</i>

28
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,273
<i>we're trusted to</i>
<i>run the government.</i>

29
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,276
<i>My father works alongside</i>
<i>our leader, Marcus.</i>

30
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,849
<i>It all works.</i>
<i>Everyone knows</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

31
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,418
<i>Except for me.</i>

32
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,898
<i>My mother says</i>
<i>there's an art to</i>
<i>losing yourself.</i>

33
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,938
<i>But I haven't</i>
<i>figured it out yet.</i>

34
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,440
<i>I'm supposed to</i>
<i>never think of myself,</i>

35
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,309
<i>to always help others.</i>

36
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,446
<i>To never look too</i>
<i>long in the mirror.</i>

37
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,485
Are you nervous?

38
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:48,955
No.

39
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,358
Were you? For your test?

40
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,393
Mmm-mm. No.

41
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,461
I was terrified.

42
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,633
But I didn't have
any reason to be
and neither do you.

43
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,743
That's all you get.

44
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,847
Rules are rules.

45
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,423
<i>Today I take the test.</i>

46
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,962
<i>I'm scared it'll tell</i>
<i>me I'm not abnegation.</i>

47
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,864
<i>That I have to leave my family.</i>

48
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,302
<i>But I'm even more scared</i>
<i>that it will tell me to stay.</i>

49
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,807
<i>For my brother Caleb, it's easy.</i>

50
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,841
Let me help you with that.

51
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,476
<i>He's a natural.</i>

52
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,347
Beatrice, do you
wanna get the other bags?

53
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,781
Sorry.

54
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,949
What if she'd been
blind or an amputee?

55
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,384
Would you have helped her then?

56
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,119
I was thinking
about helping her.

57
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,654
It's not that hard.

58
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,956
For you, maybe.

59
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,726
Just relax, Beatrice.
Take a deep breath
and trust the test.

60
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,563
<i>Trust the test.</i>

61
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,898
<i>Test will tell me who</i>
<i>I am, where I belong.</i>

62
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,969
<i>Am I smart?</i>

63
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,706
<i>Kind?</i>

64
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,708
<i>Am I honest?</i>

65
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,510
<i>Selfless?</i>

66
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,413
<i>Or brave?</i>

67
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:25,450
Hey. So, all the food
that we're not getting,

68
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,686
you guys are giving away
to the factionless?

69
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,621
Right? Yeah?
Yeah.

70
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,557
You're a liar.
Why are you lying to me?

71
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,059
Everybody knows
you keep it for yourselves.

72
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,494
So why don't you just admit it?

73
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,530
Huh?

74
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,932
I'm talking to you.
Are all you stiffs
deaf or somethin'? Hey!

75
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,902
Beatrice...

76
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,037
Don't.

77
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,972
One hundred years ago,
after the war,

78
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,208
our founders created
a system they believed

79
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,711
would prevent future conflict
and create lasting peace.

80
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,648
Today, aptitude testing
based on your personality

81
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,818
will assign you to
one of the factions.

82
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,853
While it is our belief that
choosing the faction

83
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,655
indicated by your test
is the best way to ensure

84
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,858
success within
the faction system,

85
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,761
it is your right tomorrow
at the choosing ceremony

86
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,796
<i>to choose any of</i>
<i>the five factions,</i>

87
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,998
<i>regardless of your test results.</i>

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,469
<i>However, once</i>
<i>the choice has been made,</i>

89
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,604
<i>there will be no</i>
<i>change permitted.</i>

90
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,791
What is it with you
abnegation and mirrors?

91
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,628
We reject vanity.

92
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,762
Yeah. I know. Sit down.

93
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,546
I'm Tori. I'll be
administering your test.

94
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,615
You'll be offered
a series of choices

95
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,817
to test your
aptitude for each faction

96
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,519
until you get one result.

97
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,054
I wouldn't sweat it.

98
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,156
95% get
the faction of their origin,

99
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,858
and from the looks of you...

100
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,797
What is it?

101
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,932
Bottoms up.

102
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,947
Choose.

103
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,684
Now. Before it's too late.

104
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,020
Why? What will I
do with them?

105
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,121
Choose.

106
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,823
Just tell me.

107
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,364
Puppy!

108
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,021
Get up.

109
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,956
We're going out the back door
before a supervisor comes.

110
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,858
But what was my result?
Come on!

111
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,062
What happened?

112
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,064
You're going to
tell your family
that the serum made you sick

113
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,165
and that I sent you home.
All right?

114
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,067
No, but what was my result?

115
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,202
Abnegation.

116
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,339
And erudite.
And dauntless.

117
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,109
Dauntless...

118
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,211
Your results were inconclusive.

119
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,146
That's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.

120
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,981
No. Not impossible.

121
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,283
It's just extremely rare.

122
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,387
They call it "divergent."

123
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,791
You can't tell
anyone about this.
Not even your parents.

124
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,760
As far as
the world is concerned,

125
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,062
you received
an abnegation result because

126
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,497
that is what I manually entered.

127
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,333
So what am I supposed to do
at the choosing ceremony?

128
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,769
I was supposed to
learn what to do.

129
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,471
This was supposed to tell me
what faction to choose,
the test.

130
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,972
We're supposed
to trust the test.

131
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,441
The test didn't work on you.

132
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,479
You have to trust yourself.

133
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,495
What happened to you today?

134
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,831
Where did you go
after your test?

135
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,467
I got sick,
so they sent me home early.

136
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,269
Did you finish your test?

137
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,336
Mmm-hmm.

138
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,574
What was your result?

139
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,379
What was yours?

140
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,083
Why did you just leave
without telling anybody?

141
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,351
I was sick.

142
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,855
Beatrice...

143
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,891
I don't think you understand
the level of
scrutiny we're under.

144
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,494
They're doing
everything they can
to discredit us right now.

145
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,563
Who is?

146
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,832
Erudite.

147
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,568
They believe that they should
be the governing faction,
not us.

148
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,503
So you have to be
careful right now, okay?

149
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,538
Even Marcus is under attack.

150
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
For what?

151
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,010
It's an old accusation.

152
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,913
That he mistreated his son

153
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,195
and that's why the boy defected.

154
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,151
Is that true?
No.

155
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,953
'Course not.

156
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,556
Children defect for
all kinds of reasons.

157
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,233
Don't take too long in here.
You need a good
night's sleep...

158
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,869
For tomorrow.

159
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,007
I, um...

160
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,547
We love you.

161
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,361
Good night.

162
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,431
I'm so proud of you, honey.

163
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,977
Beatrice?
What?

164
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,514
Tomorrow when we choose...

165
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,019
You have to think of the family.

166
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,420
Yeah.

167
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,556
But you also have
to think of yourself.

168
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,603
<i>Factions, please gather</i>
<i>in your assigned areas.</i>

169
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,346
Morning, jeanine.

170
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,749
Good morning, Andrew.
How is Marcus holding up?

171
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,151
As well as can be expected.

172
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,620
We need to find out
who's behind these rumors.

173
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,091
I think we all know who it is.

174
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:37,328
If it's someone from erudite,
I promise I'll find out who.

175
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,763
These are your children.

176
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,231
I don't think I knew
they were choosing today.

177
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,266
What's your name?
I'm... I'm Caleb.

178
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,368
It's a pleasure to meet you.

179
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,602
Jeanine Matthews.

180
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,571
And you are?

181
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,006
This is Beatrice.

182
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,710
Well, you both have a big
decision to make today.

183
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,546
I'm sure your
parents will support
whatever choice you make.

184
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,615
That's not
supposed to be a choice.

185
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,019
The test should
tell us what to do.

186
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,488
You're still free to choose.

187
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,189
But you don't really want that.

188
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,424
Beatrice...

189
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,562
I want you to
choose who you truly are

190
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,098
and where you truly belong.

191
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,435
Not on a whim.
Not because you wish
you were someone you're not.

192
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,738
But because you
honestly know yourself.

193
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
I want you to choose wisely.

194
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,309
And I know you will.

195
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,485
The faction system
is a living being

196
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,589
composed of cells, all of you.

197
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,225
And the only way it
can survive and thrive

198
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,496
is for each of you
to claim your rightful place.

199
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,634
The future belongs to those
who know where they belong.

200
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,175
When we leave this room,

201
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,677
you will no longer be dependents

202
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
but full-fledged
members of our society.

203
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,149
Faction before blood.

204
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,685
Faction before blood.

205
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,257
I love you...

206
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,726
No matter what.

207
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,797
Jonathan ziegler.

208
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,715
Erudite.

209
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,785
Jeffrey yates.

210
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,522
Dauntless.

211
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,492
Morgan Stokes.

212
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,696
Amity.

213
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,838
Claire satron. Candor.

214
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,608
Sam robertson. Abnegation.

215
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,677
Caleb prior.

216
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,866
Erudite.

217
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,879
Quiet, please.

218
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,449
Beatrice prior.

219
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,309
Dauntless.

220
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,423
Welcome to dauntless!

221
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,126
Come on! Let's go!

222
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,049
Come on!

223
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,694
Sorry.

224
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,929
You made it.

225
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,666
I'm Christina.
Beatrice.

226
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,872
Is it just me or are
they trying to kill us?

227
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,620
Get ready!

228
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,707
Yeah!

229
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,744
They're jumping.
What?

230
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,182
What if you don't jump?

231
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,584
What do you think?
You'll be factionless.

232
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,586
Good luck, Al.

233
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,755
Whoa!

234
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,131
Together?
Yeah.

235
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,968
One, two, three...

236
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,518
All right, listen up!

237
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,490
I'm Eric.
I'm one of your leaders.

238
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,725
If you want to
enter dauntless,
this is the way in.

239
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,660
And if you don't
have the guts to jump,

240
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,729
then you don't
belong in dauntless.

241
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,698
Is there water at
the bottom or something?

242
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,899
I guess you'll find out.

243
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,503
Or not.

244
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,872
We just jumped.
They want us to jump again?

245
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,594
Someone's gotta go first.
Who's it gonna be?

246
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,619
Me.

247
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,645
Yeah, stiff, take it off!

248
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,747
Put it back on!

249
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,239
Today, initiate.

250
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,741
What, you get pushed?

251
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:51,743
No.

252
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,280
What's your name?

253
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,615
It's...

254
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,085
Is that a hard one?

255
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,087
You can pick
a new one if you want,
but make it good.

256
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,822
You don't get to pick again.

257
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,994
Okay... my name's tris.

258
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,365
First jumper, tris!

259
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,367
Welcome to dauntless.

260
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,984
Dauntless-born,
go with Lauren,
transfers stay with me.

261
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,120
Go.

262
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,187
This way.

263
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,258
Most of the time I
work in intelligence,

264
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,961
but during your training,
I'll be your instructor.

265
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,697
My name's four.

266
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,931
Four like the number?

267
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,701
Exactly like the number.

268
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,870
What happened,
one through three were taken?

269
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,276
What's your name?

270
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,344
Christina.

271
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,352
Well, Christina.

272
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,854
The first lesson
you learn from me

273
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,456
if you wanna survive here,

274
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,991
is keep your mouth shut.

275
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,994
Do you understand me?

276
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,162
Yes.

277
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,398
Good.

278
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,002
Follow me.

279
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,215
The center of life
here at dauntless.

280
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,803
You're gonna be sleeping here
for the next 10 weeks.

281
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,899
Girls or boys?

282
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,301
Both.

283
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,270
- Nice.
- That works.

284
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,339
If you like this,
you're gonna
love the bathroom.

285
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,341
Great.

286
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,512
Okay...

287
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:43,280
- Seriously?
- Is there no other area?

288
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,450
Are you kidding?

289
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,951
You should feel
right at home, candor.

290
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,853
Everything out in the open.

291
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,455
Is this a joke?

292
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,556
Get changed.

293
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,860
Right. Shower, anyone?

294
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,500
Nice legs, stiff.

295
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,606
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

296
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,076
Shall we sit there?

297
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,199
Have you never seen
a hamburger before?

298
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,269
No, I've seen one.
I just have never eaten one.

299
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,171
Abnegation eat plain food.

300
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:17,441
Plant-based
diet with no sauces
and a minimum of seasoning.

301
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,683
Which textbook did you swallow?

302
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,013
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm will. Erudite.

303
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,149
Of course you are.

304
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,518
No offense, but I'm surprised
abnegation even eats at all.

305
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,388
Too selfish, right?
No wonder you left.

306
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,423
You gotta be
pretty self-confident
to be friends with a candor.

307
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,625
What is that supposed to mean?

308
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,326
You have no filter.

309
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,961
You say the first thing
that comes into your head.

310
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,243
You mean like,
"you're an idiot"?

311
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,599
Nice one, Al.
At least we tell the truth.

312
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,035
Erudite can tell the truth
because we have the facts.

313
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,797
I don't want to hear
about your old factions.

314
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,174
You're dauntless now.

315
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:54,611
Were you a transfer, too?
Or dauntless-born?

316
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,514
Are you kidding?

317
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,616
No.

318
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,121
What makes you think
you can talk to me?

319
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,058
It...

320
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,328
Must be because
you're so approachable.

321
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,939
Careful.

322
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,475
Four...

323
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,046
You, my friend,
have a death wish.

324
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,316
You know,
he was first in his class.

325
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,384
They tried to recruit him
for leadership twice,

326
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:35,686
but he said no.

327
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,300
Initiates, stand.

328
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,209
You have chosen to
join the warrior faction

329
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,113
tasked with
the defense of this city
and all its inhabitants.

330
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,216
We believe in
ordinary acts of bravery

331
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,252
and the courage
that drives one person

332
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,054
to stand up for another.

333
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,290
Respect that.

334
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,592
Do us proud.

335
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,171
Whoa!

336
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,607
I want everyone in the pit.
Two minutes.

337
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,451
There are two
stages of training.

338
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,820
The first is physical.

339
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,522
Push your bodies to
the breaking point

340
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:20,123
and you'll master
the methods of combat.

341
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:24,094
The second is mental.
Again, breaking point.

342
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,829
You'll face your worst fears
and conquer them

343
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,331
unless they get you first.

344
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,333
You'll be trained separately
from the dauntless-born,

345
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,436
but you'll be ranked together.

346
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:36,673
After initiations,
rankings will determine
what jobs you move into.

347
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,643
Leadership, guarding the fence,

348
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,445
or keeping the factionless
from killing each other.

349
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,447
The rankings will also
determine who gets cut.

350
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,318
Cut?

351
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,420
At the end of each
stage of training,
the lowest-ranking initiates

352
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,322
will be leaving us.

353
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,591
To do what?

354
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,694
There's no going
home to your families,
so you'd live factionless.

355
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,164
Why didn't we know that?

356
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,133
It's a new rule.

357
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,134
A new rule?
Somebody should
have told us that.

358
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,435
Why?

359
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,604
Would you have
chosen differently?

360
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,407
Out of fear?

361
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,844
I mean, if that's the case,
you might as well get out now.

362
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:16,847
If you're really one of us,
it won't matter to
you that you might fail.

363
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,749
Now you chose us.

364
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,886
Now we get to choose you.

365
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,678
Statistically speaking,
you should have hit the target

366
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,880
at least once by now.

367
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,482
Even by accident.

368
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,258
Hey. What have you got?

369
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,661
Factionless.
Not doing anything.

370
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,796
Check it out, stiff.
That's gonna be
your new family.

371
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,169
Go say "hi."

372
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,311
You ready for
some real fighting?

373
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,180
Not even close.

374
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,182
First jumper!

375
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,484
In the ring.

376
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,820
Last jumper!

377
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,890
Time to fight.

378
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,266
How long do we fight for?

379
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,202
Till one of you can't continue.

380
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,836
Or one of you concedes.

381
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,638
According to the old rules.

382
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,707
New rules, no one concedes.

383
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,511
You really want to lose
'em on their first fight?

384
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,613
A brave man never surrenders.

385
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:00,283
Lucky for you, those weren't
the rules when we fought.

386
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,846
You'll be scored on this,
so fight hard.

387
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,756
Go!

388
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,911
Don't be scared, stiff!

389
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,350
Nice, tris!

390
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,765
- Nice.
- Yeah!

391
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,675
All right, guys, over here.

392
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,444
Listen up.

393
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,650
Know what this board is?

394
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,019
It's your life.

395
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,921
We grade you every day.

396
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,823
If you're still in the red by
the end of the first stage,

397
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,058
you're out.

398
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,561
<i>I'm never gonna make it.</i>

399
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,430
Yes, you are.

400
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,998
I'm the weakest one here.

401
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,900
Then you'll be most improved.

402
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,437
You're candor.
You're not supposed to lie.

403
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:31,374
I was candor.
And I'm not lying.

404
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,877
If they cut me, I think my
parents would take me back.

405
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:37,414
No, it doesn't work like that.

406
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,317
Even if they wanted to,
their faction
wouldn't allow it.

407
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,585
Even if my parents
would take me back,

408
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,955
I wouldn't belong there anymore.

409
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:47,957
This is getting depressing.

410
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,592
Yeah.

411
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,661
You know
what we should do?
Get tattoos.

412
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,623
Did you know they had
a tattoo of your face?

413
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,673
- Like it?
- Yeah.

414
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,375
Where would you get it?
I don't know.

415
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,577
Where do you suggest?

416
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,879
Anywhere you want.

417
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,749
Here, it's this thing here.

418
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,601
You remember me, right?

419
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,371
I was just wondering
if you could...

420
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,438
No.

421
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,074
I just do tattoos.

422
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Okay.

423
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,959
I'd like this one.

424
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,128
Please.

425
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,670
Can I just ask you...

426
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,707
You made a mistake
choosing dauntless.

427
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,542
They'll find out about you...
Who?

428
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,145
Who will?

429
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,546
The people you're a threat to.

430
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:17,881
What people? Who, dauntless?

431
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:19,983
No, society.

432
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,452
If you don't fit
into a category,
they can't control you.

433
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,122
I don't get it.

434
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,891
I'm dauntless.
I'm going to be dauntless.

435
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,159
I chose dauntless.

436
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,731
For your sake, I hope so.

437
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,135
You're weak.
You have no muscle.

438
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,742
You're never gonna win,
not like that.

439
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,244
That's good to know.
Yeah, you're gonna have to

440
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,613
use your whole body.

441
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,014
Keep tension here.

442
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,686
Okay...
And go on offense.

443
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,556
You're fast, so you could win
if you attack first.

444
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,338
You get inside,
you jab to the throat.

445
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,862
Four!

446
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,664
Keep working.

447
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,908
Sorry about that, will.

448
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,651
Come on, Chris.

449
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,627
Stop... stop!

450
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,664
I'm done. I'm done.

451
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,666
You need to stop?

452
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,335
Okay.

453
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,271
Let me give you a hand.

454
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,714
Thanks.

455
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,236
All right,
let's everyone take a break!

456
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,260
You feelin' a little better?

457
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,028
Yeah, I'm fine.

458
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,164
Whoa!

459
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,002
Grab the rail.

460
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:27,370
Or don't.

461
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,708
You've got three options.

462
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,943
Hang there and I'll
forget your cowardice.

463
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,078
Fall and die.

464
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,647
Or give up.

465
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,289
But if you give up, you're out.

466
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,261
Come on, Chris!

467
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,278
Time!

468
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,155
Dauntless never give up.

469
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,132
As dauntless,
we fight to protect

470
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,167
every life inside the fence,
without fail.

471
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,737
That's why we train
you the way we do.

472
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,674
To teach you not to give up.

473
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,012
And to find out who
has what it takes.

474
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,984
<i>Even though it's been quiet</i>
<i>out there for years,</i>

475
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:51,054
<i>that could change at any moment.</i>

476
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:52,922
<i>So we have to be</i>
<i>ready for everything.</i>

477
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:53,990
Whoo!

478
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,374
What's out there?

479
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,443
Monsters.

480
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:15,144
Amity farms.

481
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,979
No, I know. But beyond that?

482
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,582
Places that never
recovered from the war.

483
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,084
Do you know?

484
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:23,319
Let's just say they built
their fence for a reason.

485
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,205
Man!

486
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,116
You're kinda good at this.

487
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,350
Come on.

488
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,759
That was pathetic.

489
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,896
It slipped.

490
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:07,898
Well, go get it!

491
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,237
What, while they're throwing?

492
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,105
Are you afraid?

493
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,107
Of getting stabbed
by an airborne knife? Yeah.

494
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,408
Everybody stop.

495
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,441
Stand in front of the target.

496
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,861
Four, gimme a hand here.

497
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,964
You're gonna stand there
while he throws those knives.

498
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,836
And if I see you flinch,
you're out.

499
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,306
One thing you will learn here

500
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,975
is that orders are not optional.

501
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,293
Stop.

502
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,201
Anyone can stand in
front of a target.
It doesn't prove anything.

503
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,336
Then it should be easy
for you to take his place.

504
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,982
Same rules apply.

505
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,159
Oh, come on, four.

506
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,208
You can get closer than that.

507
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,509
You want me to give
her a little trim?

508
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,345
Yeah, maybe just
a little off the top.

509
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,362
Points for bravery, stiff.

510
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:22,098
Not as many as you just lost
for opening your mouth.

511
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,436
Now watch yourself.

512
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,073
We train soldiers, not rebels.

513
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,111
But we're done for today.
Get out.

514
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,152
You all right?
You cut me.

515
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,487
I meant to.

516
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,657
You meant to?

517
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:50,293
You think he was gonna
let you off without a scratch?

518
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:54,597
You'd still be standing there
if I hadn't hit you.

519
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,565
So am I supposed to thank you?

520
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,271
You're supposed to be smart.

521
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,107
If I wanted to hurt you,
I would have.

522
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,420
There she is.

523
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,092
You do have a death wish.

524
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,294
I can't believe you
said that to Eric.

525
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,996
You're the only one
who's ever stood up to him.

526
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,031
Look at your ear.
Let's get you cleaned up.

527
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,199
Hey, tris.

528
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,202
That was cool.

529
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:34,470
Thanks.

530
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,510
Impressive, stiff. Congrats.

531
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:42,545
Shut up.

532
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:43,546
What? Hey, you're famous now.

533
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,147
Hold up.

534
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,682
I mean, not because
of the thing with Eric.

535
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,151
You're in the news.
Yeah, listen.

536
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,588
"The recent transfers
of Beatrice and Caleb prior,

537
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,690
"children of Andrew prior,

538
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,659

"of abnegation's
teachings and values.

540
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,264
"What prompted them to leave?

541
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,533
"Perhaps the answer lies
in the corrupted ideal

542
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:06,268
"of an entire faction.

543
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,071
"The theft of resources,
the general incompetence,

544
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:11,007
"the abuse of their children."

545
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,689
Did they beat you,
like Marcus eaton's kid?

546
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,147
They didn't beat anyone.
They're good people.

547
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,549
Right.
And that's why you left?

548
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,357
Was it something I said?

549
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,759
He's an idiot.
Yeah.

550
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,494
Yeah. That's okay.

551
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,336
What's she doing at dauntless?

552
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,442
Prior.

553
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,677
You're Andrew prior's
daughter, aren't you?

554
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,347
Beatrice.

555
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:53,783
It's just tris now.

556
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:55,384
Tris, I like that.

557
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,456
Hmm.

558
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,526
You made an impressive choice,
tris, despite your parents.

559
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:05,194
And your test result.

560
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,730
You've seen my test result?

561
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,566
Of course.

562
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,701
I'm glad you were smart enough
to know your own mind.

563
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,673
Let me know if you
ever need anything.

564
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,084
Well, that was weird.

565
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,086
Yeah.

566
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,390
What do you think is goin' on?

567
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:37,460
I bet they're
hunting divergents.

568
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,762
That's all they talk about
at erudite these days.

569
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,233
Wait.
Divergents are real?

570
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,801
Come on, Al.

571
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,245
First fight.
Peter versus tris.

572
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,248
What?

573
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,250
Uh-oh.

574
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,853
It's Eric.

575
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:05,788
He's just trying
to get back at you.

576
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,427
- Hey.
- What?

577
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,364
Remember what I
said about attack?

578
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,399
First shot, right to the throat.

579
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,901
And you watch him.

580
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:21,437
He steps before he punches.

581
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,505
All right?

582
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:23,572
Mmm.

583
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,648
All right there, stiff?

584
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,351
Look like you're about to cry.

585
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,852
Might take it easy
on you if you cry.

586
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,454
Come on, tris.

587
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:04,947
Get up. Get up.

588
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,815
Come on.
Stop playin' with each other.

589
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,263
Wow. You look...

590
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:55,265
Look bad.

591
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,270
How long have I been here?

592
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,404
About a day.

593
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,573
A day?

594
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,009
Have you seen the scoreboard?
Where am I?

595
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:09,411
You got below the line.

596
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,883
Why are you wearing those vests?

597
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,287
War games.

598
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:20,856
Whoa. What are you doing?

599
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,391
I'm coming.
You can't.

600
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:24,026
Eric says you're done.

601
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:25,561
What?

602
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,795
He said you're out.

603
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,866
Your father's on
the council, tris.

604
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,868
Maybe they'll
make an exception
and let you go home.

605
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,472
We're sorry, tris.

606
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,541
We gotta go.
We're gonna miss the train.

607
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:41,910
Yeah, okay.

608
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,885
- Bye.
- Bye.

609
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,353
- Bye.
- Bye.

610
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,632
Thanks.

611
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,641
Hi.

612
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,009
Hi.
What are you doing here?

613
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,611
I just figured
that I had to make it.

614
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:50,846
Who let you out?

615
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,083
I did.

616
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:55,451
You did?

617
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,659
Okay.

618
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,607
Let's sit you down.

619
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,776
The game's simple.
It's like capture the flag.

620
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,012
Weapon of choice.

621
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,382
You call that a gun?

622
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,794
Neuro-stim dart.

623
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,430
Simulates the pain of
a real gunshot wound.

624
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:43,465
Only lasts a couple minutes.

625
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,901
Two teams.
Four and I are captains.

626
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,736
You pick first.

627
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,972
Okay. Edward.

628
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,942
I'll take the stiff.

629
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,778
Oh. Picking the weak ones

630
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,540
so you've got someone
to blame when you lose.

631
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,149
Something like that.

632
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,560
Where did Eric's team go?

633
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,061
They must have gone to the end.

634
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,001
All right. Lights off.

635
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,068
Gather around. Come on.

636
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,971
Okay. What's your strategy?

637
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,441
We can hide the flag
well enough so
they can't find it.

638
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,109
Let's send out a team
to scout their location.
See if we can find their flag.

639
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,744
I say we blitz them.
Just beat them
with sheer force.

640
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:29,945
Yeah, that's the best
way to lose quickly.

641
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,447
Let's make them come to us.

642
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:32,714
End this quickly,
they won't expect it.

643
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,583
We don't know where they are.

644
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,584
Okay,
we split into two groups,
defense and offense.

645
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,952
Who put you in charge?

646
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,220
Someone has to make a decision.

647
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:39,688
We need to be more aggressive.

648
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,850
We need to be smart about it.

649
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,035
You're not gonna jump, are you?

650
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:55,904
No, I'm just trying to get
a good vantage point.

651
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,241
Good thinking.

652
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,946
You don't have to come with me.

653
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:06,014
You should go easy.
You took a beating.

654
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,983
I'm surprised you noticed.

655
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,651
I saw you leave
during the fight.

656
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,573
Yeah, well, it's not something
I wanted to watch.

657
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,663
Hey!

658
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,038
You good?

659
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,575
You okay?

660
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,910
Yeah. I'm fine.

661
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,017
This is high enough.

662
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,153
No, we need to go higher.

663
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,159
You all right?

664
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,965
You're afraid of heights.

665
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,101
Everyone's afraid of something.

666
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,483
I didn't think you
were afraid of anything.

667
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,816
Come on, tris.

668
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,088
Really?

669
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,327
Are you even human?

670
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,011
This isn't so bad.

671
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,050
Good eye.

672
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,355
Look!

673
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,823
There it is.

674
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,960
All right.
What's your plan?

675
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,928
We split into two groups.

676
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,197
We'll go up this side
and let the rest
of you engage Eric.

677
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,276
- I can see 'em.
- Go! Go!

678
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,879
Light 'em up!

679
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,751
There's two more!
I'm gonna move in closer!

680
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,119
Follow me. Go!

681
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,957
- Watch on your right!
- Go, go, go.

682
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,827
Go.

683
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:32,861
Christina, let's go!

684
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:34,196
Get 'em, get 'em!

685
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,770
This way!

686
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:42,838
- Cover me!
- All right.

687
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:52,981
Tell me if this hurts.

688
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,950
You tell me.

689
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,418
You bitch!

690
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,087
Asshole.

691
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:02,991
That was awesome!

692
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,194
Get covered!

693
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,890
Go, tris!
I'll guard.

694
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,879
Whoo!

695
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,987
Game over!

696
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,456
Good job, tris!

697
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,296
Hey, tris!

698
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,430
Yeah?

699
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:16,865
Come with us.

700
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,166
Where you going?

701
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:19,768
Shortcut back.

702
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,905
A little initiation ritual,
dauntless style.

703
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,131
Wow.

704
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,282
All right, let's do this!

705
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,483
- Good.
- All right, you good?

706
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:09,985
- Hang tight.
- Yeah. Go, go!

707
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,353
Fly, baby.
Whoo!

708
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,124
You're up.

709
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,161
All right, do it!

710
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,797
Come on, girl.

711
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,401
Go for it! Do it, tris!

712
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,338
Like flying!

713
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,042
Don't forget to pull
the brake at the bottom!

714
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:35,343
Okay.

715
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,814
Go.

716
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:39,881
You ready?

717
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:41,116
Harness is good.

718
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,045
Pull the brake!
Pull the brake!

719
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,968
Yeah!

720
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,513
Tris!

721
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:26,388
Hey.
Hey.

722
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,456
Congratulations.

723
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,027
Thanks.

724
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:35,063
You know, I wanted to say
that you were
really good tonight.

725
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:36,598
You were brave.

726
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,402
Yeah.

727
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,192
Anyway, you should
get back to your friends.

728
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,044
Okay.

729
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,291
If you're ranked
above the red line,

730
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,627
you'll move on to
the second stage of training.

731
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,329
If you're below it,

732
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,611
we'll waste no more time on you.

733
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,367
Here are your rankings.

734
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,410
Nice.

735
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,448
You made it.

736
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,582
You made it, tris.

737
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,523
- Got it.
- Thank you.

738
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:53,375
Here you go.

739
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:56,277
So we pass
the first stage of training,
and this is our reward.

740
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,345
Toss it up!

741
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,546
Glamorous.

742
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,690
Mom?

743
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,629
Oh, my girl!

744
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,466
Mom, what are you doing here?

745
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:53,334
I knew they'd assign
you here sooner or later.

746
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:55,570
Look at you!
God, you're so
strong and beautiful.

747
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:58,706
Mom, you can't be here.

748
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,275
I know, but you're in danger.

749
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:01,509
What?

750
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:04,079
I had to ask you something.

751
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:06,521
You weren't sick the day
you took your
aptitude test, were you?

752
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,450
Why?

753
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:09,573
What were your test results?

754
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,154
Honey, it's okay.
You can tell me.

755
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,262
They were...
They were inconclusive.

756
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,266
Divergent?

757
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,102
You can't tell anyone.
You can't tell your friends,

758
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,170
your instructors.
You can't trust anyone.

759
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,872
I'm not.

760
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:34,209
People have always been
so threatened by divergents.

761
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,643
But now erudite
is looking for
them everywhere.

762
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:36,644
They're actively
seeking them out.

763
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,213
Why?

764
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:40,248
Mom, what am I?

765
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,450
You don't conform.
Your mind works in
a million different ways.

766
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:45,253
They're scared of you.

767
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:48,289
Stage two of training
is where you are most at risk.

768
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,524
They're gonna get
inside your head

769
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,392
and watch how you
respond to fear.

770
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,228
But you can pass.
You can make it
through dauntless.

771
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,396
I have seen it before.

772
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:57,899
How do you know
so much about this?
About dauntless?

773
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,502
Never mind about me.
Do not let them
know who you are.

774
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:02,237
Wait!
Wait! Were you dauntless?

775
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,438
- Listen.
- Hey!

776
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,142
What are you doing?

777
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,681
Truck's loaded. Let's go.

778
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,870
What did they do to her?

779
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:38,740
Tris.

780
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,953
Take a seat.

781
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,660
I'm going to inject you
with a serum that stimulates

782
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,728
the part of your
brain that processes fear.

783
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:02,530
Great.

784
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,732
It induces a hallucination,

785
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,301
and then
transmitters in the serum

786
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:07,602
allow me to see
the images in your mind.

787
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:08,803
You can see inside my mind?

788
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:10,872
Mmm-hmm.

789
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,344
Lay back.

790
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,332
Now, you're gonna be facing
your worst fears, tris.

791
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,867
Most people have 10
to 15 really bad ones.

792
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,371
You have to calm yourself.

793
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,839
Slow your heart rate
and your breathing,

794
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,281
and deal with
what's in front of you.

795
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,780
Be brave.

796
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,024
This isn't real.

797
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,941
It's all right, it's all right.

798
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:28,509
You okay?

799
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,795
How long do you think
you were in the hallucination,
tris?

800
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:50,865
Twenty minutes?
Three.

801
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,401
Four times faster
than the average.

802
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,673
I've never seen anyone
do that well the first time.

803
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,541
How did you get
rid of the birds?

804
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,009
The image wasn't clear.

805
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:03,711
Um...

806
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,413
I just went into the water.

807
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,152
Well, next time
it'll be a lot easier.

808
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,121
I have to do that again?

809
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,789
Yeah, you have to practice
several times
before the final,

810
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:15,990
but you're a natural.

811
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:17,892
You got nothing to worry about.

812
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,531
My whole body
was covered in
these little insects.

813
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,933
They were in my ears,
and my throat...

814
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,736
I couldn't breathe.

815
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,639
Yeah, I heard about this guy,
like two years ago...

816
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,107
So panicked he had
a heart attack in his chair

817
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:35,076
and he almost died.
What?

818
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,038
Yeah, so we've got that
to look forward to, right?

819
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,614
You didn't seem to
have any problem at all.

820
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:43,418
Me? No, no, my God,
it was awful.

821
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,520
Oh, come on.
No one even came
close to your time.

822
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:47,121
You were amazing.
Yeah, what's amazing is that

823
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,556
she's gonna knock
you right out of dauntless.

824
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,191
She's not gonna knock
me out of dauntless.

825
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:52,593
Look, she's gone from being
the worst to one of the best.

826
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,662
Somebody's gotta take
her place at the bottom.

827
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,064
Who's it gonna be? You.

828
01:13:57,066 --> 01:13:58,633
Do you ever stop talking?

829
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:00,735
I just want to
know how she does it.

830
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:02,837
What's your trick?

831
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:04,605
I don't have a trick.

832
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,940
Nobody gets
through it that fast.

833
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,342
Why don't you tell
us how you do it?

834
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,579
At least tell your friends.

835
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,483
What's he talkin' about?

836
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:16,684
Is there some way
to make it easier?

837
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:17,718
No.

838
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,025
No, I...
I'm not doing anything.

839
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:55,156
Hey! Hey!

840
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,758
This isn't real.

841
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,047
How'd you do that?

842
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,182
What?

843
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,920
How'd you break the glass?

844
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,323
I don't know. Just did it.

845
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:04,992
You just did it?

846
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,773
What were your test results?

847
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,242
Your aptitude test.

848
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,178
Abnegation.

849
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,847
I don't think so.

850
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:27,949
What?

851
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:30,084
I think you're lying to me.

852
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,988
Why would I lie to you?

853
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,627
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

854
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,763
What were your test results?

855
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,168
Abnegation.

856
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,872
Time for you to go.

857
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,313
Tris?

858
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,817
Just so you know,

859
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,386
dauntless don't break
the glass like that.

860
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,661
My brother was like you.

861
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:16,297
During the second stage,
he got good really fast.

862
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:17,999
Last day of the simulations,

863
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,968
one of the dauntless leaders
came to watch him.

864
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,071
Then the next morning,
we found his body

865
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,040
at the bottom of the chasm.

866
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,642
They got rid of him.

867
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,844
Who did?

868
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:31,145
Dauntless leadership.

869
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,647
You can't let them
find out about you.

870
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,984
And what if they already know?

871
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,320
Then you're already dead.

872
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,422
Beatrice.

873
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,465
What are you doing here?

874
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:25,700
I'm in trouble.

875
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,440
What happened?

876
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:34,108
I'm not gonna
make it at dauntless.

877
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,310
I don't fit in there.

878
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:37,312
You have to fit in there.

879
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:38,379
I can't.

880
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,454
I'm just...
I'm not like them.

881
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,989
I mean, who is?
They're crazy.

882
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,227
Maybe I can go
back to abnegation.

883
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,029
You can't go back.
I know, but...

884
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:58,065
They're never
gonna let you do that.

885
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,034
Who?
Erudite.

886
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:02,116
They're not
gonna let abnegation
break any more rules.

887
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:05,940
They actually think that
they're running
the government now?

888
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,108
They might be soon.

889
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,010
Wait. Really?

890
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:12,880
Erudite should be in charge.
Certainly not abnegation.

891
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,050
Wait, hold on, Caleb.
How can you say that?

892
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:19,153
It's what all
the other factions want,
now that abnegation failed.

893
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:22,022
No. That's just what
they're telling you here...

894
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,924
It's true.
It's not true.

895
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,259
It's not.

896
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,927
There are liars here.

897
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,996
There are people who know
how to manipulate you.

898
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:30,164
You need to understand that.

899
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,465
Beatrice.

900
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:35,536
I think you should go.

901
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,409
Faction before blood. Yeah?

902
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,049
Got it.

903
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,459
I need you to come with me.

904
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,495
Stop!

905
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,799
Are you all right?

906
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,568
Yeah, I'm fine.

907
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,952
Please, sit down.

908
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,059
Thank you.

909
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:33,894
I'm glad you came here today.

910
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,162
You are?

911
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,597
Are you happy with
your new faction?

912
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,500
Yeah.

913
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,269
But you came to
see your brother.

914
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:44,305
I just...
I just wanted to talk to him.

915
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:46,907
Have you seen your parents?

916
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:47,909
No.

917
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,847
It's hard to let go.

918
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,317
Faction before blood.

919
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,118
It's an important ideal,

920
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,020
but sometimes
difficult to fulfill.

921
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:03,324
It goes against our
fundamental human nature.

922
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,159
But that's exactly the weakness

923
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,528
we need to overcome.

924
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,297
You think that human
nature is a weakness?

925
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:14,168
I think human
nature is the enemy.

926
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,470
It's human nature to
keep secrets, lie, steal.

927
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,640
And I wanna eradicate that.

928
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:23,477
That's how we'll maintain
a stable, peaceful society.

929
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,522
You would help me
with that, wouldn't you?

930
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,286
How would I help you?

931
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:34,154
You're aware
that abnegation
is undermining

932
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,457
the faction system
and breaking laws

933
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:38,492
harboring divergents?

934
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,165
I didn't know that.

935
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:49,203
But if that's true,
then I'm glad that I left.

936
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,174
See, I need to know
that I can count on you

937
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,277
to enforce the law,

938
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:59,013
even if it's been broken
by someone close to you.

939
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,514
Someone you care about.

940
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,651
Of course.

941
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,977
Then I'll have my car
take you back to dauntless.

942
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,205
Come on! Get her over!

943
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,177
Come on, do it! Do it!

944
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:04,545
Hey!

945
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,601
You all right?

946
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,004
Yeah.

947
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,006
Come on. Let's go.

948
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,452
Here, put this on.

949
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:48,255
Thank you.

950
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:49,257
You'll be safe here.

951
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,471
Sorry.

952
01:24:04,473 --> 01:24:05,539
It's okay.

953
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,314
I can't believe Al...

954
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:18,285
You're moving up
through the ranks,
and he's failing.

955
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:21,221
It makes him hate himself
and it makes him hate you.

956
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,358
He's just afraid.

957
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,326
Everyone's afraid.

958
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:29,763
I know, but fear does
something strange
to people like Al.

959
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,265
But not you.

960
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,636
Fear doesn't shut you down,
it wakes you up.

961
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,272
I've seen it.

962
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,720
You should lie down.

963
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,624
Get some sleep.
Yeah.

964
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:00,561
I'll take the floor.

965
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,353
How you feeling?

966
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:28,255
Better.

967
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:30,124
Good.

968
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,760
Where'd you go yesterday?

969
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,497
To see my brother.

970
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,137
It's getting a little
boring for you here, is it?

971
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:47,508
My brother said that...

972
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,677
He thinks erudite is planning
to overthrow abnegation.

973
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:55,449
Do you think they could do that?

974
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:57,851
Yeah, I do.
I think it's possible.

975
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,221
Depends how far
they're willing to go.

976
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,526
I'm worried about my parents.

977
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,797
Yeah.

978
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:15,569
But I think you
got other things
you need to worry about.

979
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:17,738
Don't you?

980
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:20,741
Yeah.

981
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,514
I should go.

982
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:41,828
Hi.

983
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,830
Hey.

984
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,200
Is that your sweater?

985
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,202
No.

986
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:49,603
So what happened
to you last night?

987
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:51,805
Tris, can I talk
to you for a second?

988
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,541
Listen, I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

989
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,244
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

990
01:26:57,246 --> 01:26:58,845
Please, can you ever forgive me?

991
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,850
If you ever come
close to me again,
I will kill you.

992
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:04,952
Tris...

993
01:27:04,954 --> 01:27:07,588
You need to stay away from me!

994
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,323
You are a coward.

995
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,605
I just can't
believe he would do that.

996
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:26,373
It's not like him at all.

997
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:29,443
What's that?

998
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:33,780
Come on.

999
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,353
Oh, my God!

1000
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,322
Guess he just jumped.

1001
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,273
Tris.

1002
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,508
Tris!

1003
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,710
Leave me alone.

1004
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:04,978
I'm sorry about Al.

1005
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,382
It's my fault that he's dead.

1006
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:11,551
No, it's not because of you.
He made his own choice.

1007
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:13,320
He would have been factionless.

1008
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:14,802
He was not gonna
pass that final test.

1009
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:16,957
Neither am I.

1010
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,329
Why do you say that?

1011
01:28:27,735 --> 01:28:29,036
You know why.

1012
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,942
And as soon as all
the others find out,
they're gonna kill me.

1013
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:37,778
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1014
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,323
Shut the door.

1015
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,393
You're gonna practice.

1016
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:55,362
In my fear landscape?
No.

1017
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:56,530
In mine.

1018
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,435
Have you ever done this before?

1019
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:04,971
No, I haven't.

1020
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:09,643
You sure you want to?

1021
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:11,745
Why wouldn't I?

1022
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,482
I don't know.

1023
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:17,117
You haven't told me
anything about yourself

1024
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,199
and now you're just gonna
let me inside of your head?

1025
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,388
Are you afraid of that?

1026
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,723
You're not?

1027
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:25,659
No.

1028
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:09,002
Fear of heights.

1029
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,670
I'm not surprised.

1030
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,477
It's not real.

1031
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:19,413
No.
We could just jump.

1032
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:21,047
Divergent would jump.

1033
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:23,083
Dauntless would
get to that building.

1034
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,152
If you want to pass,
if you want to
avoid discovery,

1035
01:30:25,154 --> 01:30:28,188
you have to do everything
the way
a dauntless would do it.

1036
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:31,425
You have to find some tool,
some method to survive.

1037
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:03,490
Fear of confinement.

1038
01:31:03,492 --> 01:31:04,825
You have to find
a way of stopping it.

1039
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:06,226
What would a dauntless do?

1040
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:08,695
Good!

1041
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,904
Take your time.

1042
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:19,747
I'm just enjoying myself
in this shrinking box.

1043
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:37,958
As a dauntless soldier,
you have to follow orders

1044
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,726
you don't always agree with.

1045
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,130
Who is she?

1046
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:49,236
She's an innocent.

1047
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,840
I have to kill her.

1048
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:03,617
But I can never do it.

1049
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,953
Unless I look away.

1050
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,574
Why are we in abnegation?

1051
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:32,245
Your last fear is
your worst fear.

1052
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,850
It lives in
the deepest part of your mind.

1053
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,327
Marcus had a son.

1054
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:49,930
What was his name?

1055
01:32:49,932 --> 01:32:51,865
Tobias.

1056
01:32:51,867 --> 01:32:53,199
Tobias.

1057
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,271
<i>Tobias...</i>

1058
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,675
<i>Tobias...</i>

1059
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:06,680
<i>Tobias...</i>

1060
01:33:06,682 --> 01:33:08,949
I'm just trying to
help you to be better.

1061
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:13,353
No!

1062
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,181
Four?

1063
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:42,949
Four fears?

1064
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,751
Four then, four now.

1065
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:50,256
I keep going in there,
but I don't think
you ever lose them.

1066
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:03,370
Can I ask you something?

1067
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:06,206
Sure.

1068
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:08,008
What's your tattoo?

1069
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,347
You wanna see it?

1070
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,364
It's amazing.

1071
01:34:43,978 --> 01:34:45,745
The factions.

1072
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,952
Why do you have all of them?

1073
01:34:52,954 --> 01:34:54,888
I don't want to
be just one thing.

1074
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,123
I can't be.

1075
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:02,796
I want to be brave and
I want to be selfless...

1076
01:35:02,798 --> 01:35:04,831
Intelligent and honest and kind.

1077
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:10,236
Although I'm still
working on "kind."

1078
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,004
I don't wanna go too fast.

1079
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,441
It's okay.

1080
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,512
I've already got my
spot on the floor.

1081
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:12,966
Morning.

1082
01:36:12,968 --> 01:36:14,167
Hey.

1083
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,250
Come on.
I'm gonna show you something.

1084
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:20,206
Okay.

1085
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:36,189
Look.

1086
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:43,229
Erudite.
Yeah.

1087
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,331
They're here every morning.

1088
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:47,133
I've been
watching them for weeks.

1089
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,035
What are they
doing at dauntless?

1090
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:51,504
Loading in supplies.
Computers.

1091
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:54,507
And these.

1092
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:58,812
What is it?

1093
01:36:58,814 --> 01:37:00,146
I think it's some kind
of cognitive transmitter.

1094
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,347
You inject it like a serum.

1095
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:03,149
Why?

1096
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:06,486
It's supposed to make you more
susceptible to suggestion,

1097
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:10,023
but as many as they have,
they could create an army.

1098
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:18,898
<i>Attention,</i>

1099
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:21,467
<i>all initiates</i>
<i>report for final testing.</i>

1100
01:37:21,469 --> 01:37:23,937
<i>All initiates</i>
<i>report for final testing.</i>

1101
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,980
You're ready.

1102
01:37:33,982 --> 01:37:35,381
You can do this.

1103
01:37:57,338 --> 01:38:00,874
They can see
your hallucinations
on the screen.

1104
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,976
So you get past your fears
the way a dauntless would,

1105
01:38:02,978 --> 01:38:04,544
but do it quickly.

1106
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:07,480
Right. If I'm too good,
then they'll kill me,

1107
01:38:07,482 --> 01:38:09,315
and if I'm too slow,
then I'll die.

1108
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:11,050
Right.

1109
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,485
Good luck.

1110
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,428
Good luck, tris.

1111
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:25,198
Hope you make it.

1112
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:28,554
Congratulations.

1113
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:39,732
Whoa. Four!

1114
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:43,669
Stop! Four!

1115
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:45,571
Aren't you dauntless?

1116
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,760
Please tell me that
you weren't watching that.

1117
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:09,595
Would you feel
better if I said no?

1118
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,200
You did well.

1119
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:16,269
Now...

1120
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:19,572
One final test.

1121
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:28,081
You know what to do.

1122
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,284
What?

1123
01:41:31,286 --> 01:41:33,086
If you want to be dauntless.

1124
01:41:33,088 --> 01:41:34,187
No.

1125
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:36,456
Do it.

1126
01:41:49,838 --> 01:41:51,204
You all right?

1127
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,702
That looked good to me, okay?

1128
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:00,179
Come on. Let's go.

1129
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:02,415
Congratulations,

1130
01:42:02,417 --> 01:42:03,417
new members of dauntless.

1131
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,391
Dauntless!
Dauntless! Dauntless!

1132
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,664
Come on. Get in line.

1133
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:20,600
All right, everybody, line up.

1134
01:42:20,602 --> 01:42:22,135
What's going on?

1135
01:42:22,137 --> 01:42:23,803
<i>All dauntless initiates,</i>

1136
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:25,171
<i>report to your command leader.</i>

1137
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,907
All right, listen up!

1138
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:32,678
Before you leave tonight,
I want you all in four lines.

1139
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,348
Everyone gets a tracking device.

1140
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,817
Don't ask questions.
It's just a precaution.

1141
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:51,764
Do you see four?

1142
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:54,734
No.

1143
01:42:54,736 --> 01:42:56,169
Next!

1144
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,837
What's going on?
Oh, my God.

1145
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:00,740
Congratulations.

1146
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:04,644
You should be
first in line, but...

1147
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:05,845
I'll make it easy for you.

1148
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,817
Hurts like a bitch, huh?

1149
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:14,587
Now you're really one of us.

1150
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,542
Hey, what's...

1151
01:43:50,991 --> 01:43:52,725
<i>Faction before blood.</i>

1152
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:53,893
Oh, my God.

1153
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:11,677
They can see and hear us.

1154
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,013
They just don't
process it the same way.

1155
01:44:14,015 --> 01:44:16,849
Commands come in
through the transmitter.

1156
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:26,659
What's goin' on?

1157
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:30,496
What are we doin'?

1158
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:36,602
Divergent.

1159
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:42,875
Hey!

1160
01:44:42,877 --> 01:44:44,797
Everything's fine.
There's nothing
to worry about.

1161
01:47:15,695 --> 01:47:17,630
Hurry up! Move!

1162
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:24,069
<i>Abnegation</i>
<i>leaders must</i>
<i>identify themselves.</i>

1163
01:47:24,071 --> 01:47:25,871
We need to find my parents.

1164
01:47:30,812 --> 01:47:33,546
Just keep moving.
Where's your house?

1165
01:47:33,548 --> 01:47:35,915
<i>We are looking for information.</i>

1166
01:47:35,917 --> 01:47:38,517
<i>All houses will be searched.</i>

1167
01:47:38,519 --> 01:47:40,586
<i>Do not resist.</i>
<i>You will not be hurt.</i>

1168
01:47:47,928 --> 01:47:49,528
Mom? Dad?

1169
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:53,199
Where would they have gone?

1170
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:56,101
I don't know.

1171
01:47:59,606 --> 01:48:02,174
This can't happen here!
Just stop it!

1172
01:48:08,748 --> 01:48:10,015
<i>Do not resist.</i>

1173
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,822
<i>All abnegation</i>
<i>will be questioned.</i>

1174
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:18,090
The legendary four...

1175
01:48:19,092 --> 01:48:21,160
A mindless drone.

1176
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:23,195
You were first in your class.
Now you're...

1177
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:25,731
Nothing.

1178
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:43,682
What?

1179
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,017
Think he might be...

1180
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,754
There's one way to find out.

1181
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:51,790
Say goodbye, asshole.

1182
01:48:51,792 --> 01:48:52,925
Goodbye.

1183
01:48:52,927 --> 01:48:54,093
Move and you die!

1184
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:56,829
The stiff?

1185
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:01,267
Two stiffs.

1186
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:03,035
Two dead stiffs.

1187
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:06,005
You can't let
a single divergent
slip through.

1188
01:49:06,007 --> 01:49:08,007
This is what happens.

1189
01:49:08,009 --> 01:49:09,742
She's not gonna shoot me.

1190
01:49:09,744 --> 01:49:11,585
Think you might be
overestimating my character.

1191
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:16,181
Run!

1192
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:23,923
You were hit?
Yeah.

1193
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:27,092
Right there! Don't move!

1194
01:49:27,094 --> 01:49:28,094
Drop your weapons.

1195
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,916
Tobias eaton.

1196
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:55,287
And you, Beatrice.

1197
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:59,858
I thought it was intellect
I was sensing in you.

1198
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:01,701
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

1199
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,897
Why are you attacking
all these innocent people?

1200
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:06,765
Innocent people?

1201
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:10,736
Abnegation, if left
unchecked, will destroy
the faction system.

1202
01:50:10,738 --> 01:50:13,339
Same can be said of both of you.

1203
01:50:13,341 --> 01:50:15,107
Somebody has to stop you.

1204
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:17,376
If we don't, peace will be lost.

1205
01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:20,212
It's already been lost.
You destroyed it.

1206
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:23,248
Human nature destroyed it.

1207
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:25,818
Those of us with
the vision to see that

1208
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:28,387
are called upon to
protect the rest.

1209
01:50:28,389 --> 01:50:31,223
We will restore the peace.

1210
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:33,359
And this time, it will last.

1211
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:34,994
And what if you're wrong?

1212
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:43,969
Bring him with us.

1213
01:50:47,274 --> 01:50:48,641
She's injured.

1214
01:50:50,076 --> 01:50:51,777
Any results would be unclear.

1215
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:54,793
- You can get rid of her.
- All right.

1216
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:02,287
Get down!

1217
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,062
Let's go.
Come on!

1218
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:19,071

Okay, we gotta run!

1223

You were dauntless.

1224
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:26,505
Served me well today.

1225
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:29,775
Is dad okay?

1226
01:52:29,777 --> 01:52:31,777
Yeah. He led a group over
to Monroe and state.

1227
01:52:31,779 --> 01:52:33,078
We're gonna meet him there.

1228
01:52:35,348 --> 01:52:36,381

Okay.
Come on, honey.
We gotta go.

1236
01:53:53,026 --> 01:53:55,327
I killed him. I killed him.

1237
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,096
I killed him.

No.

1242
01:54:14,314 --> 01:54:15,981
I'll go.

1243
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:23,856
Got it, sir!

1244
01:54:27,862 --> 01:54:28,894
Don't stop!
Don't stop!

1245
01:54:29,896 --> 01:54:31,430

Yeah, I'm good.

1247

01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,961
Oh, my God!

1262
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:35,087
Where's my father?

1263
01:56:35,089 --> 01:56:36,755
Beatrice?

1264
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:44,696
Your mother?

1265
01:57:05,752 --> 01:57:07,686
She saved me.

1266
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,622
She saved me.

1267
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:13,492
Then it wasn't in vain.

1268
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:17,062
We need to leave here.

1269
01:57:18,798 --> 01:57:20,499
Are there soldiers outside?

1270
01:57:25,405 --> 01:57:26,772
No, it's clear.

1271
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:30,742
I should have believed you.

1272
01:57:30,744 --> 01:57:33,612
I left as soon as I realized.

1273
01:57:33,614 --> 01:57:35,747
Why is this happening?
I don't understand.

1274
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:39,751
Why are dauntless
fighting for erudite?

1275
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:41,219
They don't know
what they're doing.

1276
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:44,289
They're under simulation.

1277
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:46,658
We need to wake 'em up.
I need to get into dauntless.

1278
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:47,759
That's a fortress.

1279
01:57:48,761 --> 01:57:50,062
It's not gonna happen.

1280
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:54,399
I can get us in there.

1281
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:03,475
Get ready.

1282
01:58:04,477 --> 01:58:06,478
What now?

1283
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,246
You're not gonna like it.

1284
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,869
There's a net at the bottom.

1285
01:58:30,871 --> 01:58:32,437
Don't think, just jump.

1286
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:45,584
Are you good?

1287
01:58:45,586 --> 01:58:46,818
Good?

1288
01:58:48,588 --> 01:58:50,188
Let's go.

1289
01:58:56,496 --> 01:58:57,829
Wait here.

1290
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:06,771
Against the wall.

1291
01:59:06,773 --> 01:59:08,406
Against the wall!

1292
01:59:12,378 --> 01:59:13,845
How are you awake?

1293
01:59:13,847 --> 01:59:16,148
Because I'm smarter than you.

1294
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:17,549
And they need me.

1295
01:59:17,551 --> 01:59:19,584
Where are they
controlling it from?

1296
01:59:19,586 --> 01:59:22,254
Why would I tell you that?
It's not like
you're gonna shoot me.

1297
01:59:22,256 --> 01:59:24,456
Why do people keep saying that?

1298
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:29,361
Where are they
controlling it from?

1299
01:59:36,536 --> 01:59:37,816
Did you really
need to shoot him?

1300
01:59:39,472 --> 01:59:41,773
Every minute we waste,
another abnegation dies

1301
01:59:41,775 --> 01:59:44,209
and another
dauntless becomes a murderer.

1302
01:59:44,211 --> 01:59:45,844
Peter, let's go.

1303
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:03,328
That's it, isn't it?

1304
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:04,663
Yeah.

1305
02:00:04,665 --> 02:00:06,498
I've seen jeanine go in there.

1306
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,300
That's where she's
controlling it from.

1307
02:00:20,646 --> 02:00:23,682
Like you said, there
isn't a second to waste.

1308
02:00:29,388 --> 02:00:30,455
Dad, no!

1309
02:00:31,958 --> 02:00:33,625
Dad...

1310
02:00:33,627 --> 02:00:34,960
Do whatever it takes...

1311
02:00:34,962 --> 02:00:36,828
Hey!

1312
02:01:15,868 --> 02:01:18,470
Watch Caleb.
I'm going in there.

1313
02:02:10,856 --> 02:02:12,524
Hey. Hi.

1314
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,673
Four...

1315
02:02:30,076 --> 02:02:32,877
Four... four,
it's me. You're in a SIM.

1316
02:02:32,879 --> 02:02:34,646
He can't hear you.

1317
02:02:36,615 --> 02:02:38,583
Amazing, isn't it?

1318
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:41,086
Everything we think of
that makes up a person,

1319
02:02:41,088 --> 02:02:44,489
thoughts, emotions, history...

1320
02:02:44,491 --> 02:02:46,491
All wiped away by chemistry.

1321
02:02:46,493 --> 02:02:47,592
Four.

1322
02:02:47,594 --> 02:02:48,927
He's gone.

1323
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:51,763
And we're all safer for it.

1324
02:02:51,765 --> 02:02:54,666
Safer? How are we safer?

1325
02:02:54,668 --> 02:02:56,835
The brilliance of
the faction system

1326
02:02:56,837 --> 02:02:59,070
is that conformity to
the faction removes the threat

1327
02:02:59,072 --> 02:03:02,774
of anyone exercising
their independent will.

1328
02:03:02,776 --> 02:03:04,909
Divergents threaten that system.

1329
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:10,482
Don't get me wrong.

1330
02:03:10,484 --> 02:03:13,551
There's a certain
beauty in your resistance,

1331
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:16,154
your defiance of categorization.

1332
02:03:16,156 --> 02:03:18,423
But it's a beauty
we can't afford.

1333
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:35,140
Four, it's me. It's me.

1334
02:03:35,142 --> 02:03:36,908
Please, four, look at me.
Look at me.

1335
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:59,164
Four! It's me!

1336
02:04:28,627 --> 02:04:29,627
Four, stop!

1337
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:32,096
Stop!

1338
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:34,632
Stop...

1339
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:38,036
Four... please...

1340
02:04:43,876 --> 02:04:46,945
It's okay, it's okay.
I love you. It's okay.

1341
02:04:51,884 --> 02:04:53,084
It's okay.

1342
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:55,787
I love you. It's okay.

1343
02:05:01,961 --> 02:05:03,127
Four, look at me. Look at me.

1344
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:09,033
It's me. It's me.

1345
02:05:09,035 --> 02:05:11,202
It's me. It's me.

1346
02:05:20,613 --> 02:05:21,613
Tris...

1347
02:05:26,986 --> 02:05:28,086
Go.

1348
02:05:31,757 --> 02:05:32,824
Finish it.

1349
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:10,328
Help!

1350
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:16,034
Hey!

1351
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:26,878
Shut it down.

1352
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,946
No.

1353
02:06:43,028 --> 02:06:44,862
I am not gonna
ask you again. Do it!

1354
02:06:44,864 --> 02:06:46,831
Shut it down!

1355
02:06:46,833 --> 02:06:48,933
I admire you willing to die
for what you believe...

1356
02:06:49,935 --> 02:06:51,202
But so am I.

1357
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:56,307
You can't do it, can you?

1358
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:34,345
Maybe you're not
quite as dauntless
as you thought you were.

1359
02:07:34,347 --> 02:07:36,080
You're right.

1360
02:07:37,783 --> 02:07:39,651
I'm not.

1361
02:07:39,653 --> 02:07:40,885
I'm divergent.

1362
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:54,198
Now shut it down
and wipe the program.

1363
02:08:23,996 --> 02:08:25,697
<i>Simulation abort.</i>

1364
02:08:25,699 --> 02:08:27,331
<i>System-wide shutdown.</i>

1365
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,375
No... no...

1366
02:08:40,412 --> 02:08:41,879
No!

1367
02:08:49,455 --> 02:08:52,123
Don't get me wrong.

1368
02:08:52,125 --> 02:08:53,845
There's a certain
beauty to your resistance.

1369
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:04,068
Tris...

1370
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:06,037
<i>Lockdown now in effect.</i>

1371
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:08,306
All right, let's move!

1372
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:11,342
We gotta go. Now.

1373
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:19,283
Tobias.

1374
02:09:21,386 --> 02:09:23,321
We need to keep moving.

1375
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:33,431
All right, move!

1376
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:49,413
Son!

1377
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,259
I got it!

1378
02:10:01,261 --> 02:10:02,393
I know you do.

1379
02:10:18,877 --> 02:10:20,378
My mom and dad died today.

1380
02:10:24,416 --> 02:10:26,150
They're gone.

1381
02:10:26,152 --> 02:10:27,919
I know.

1382
02:10:27,921 --> 02:10:29,520
But they loved you, tris.

1383
02:10:32,057 --> 02:10:34,392
For them, there was
no better way to show you.

1384
02:10:40,465 --> 02:10:42,400
Now we have nothing.

1385
02:10:42,402 --> 02:10:44,302
We have no home, no faction...

1386
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:52,076
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

1387
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:00,518
I know exactly who you are.

1388
02:11:02,221 --> 02:11:03,554
You sure about that?

1389
02:11:05,424 --> 02:11:07,391
Yeah, I'm very sure.

1390
02:11:11,063 --> 02:11:12,230
Come here.

1391
02:11:25,577 --> 02:11:28,079
<i>We're like the factionless now.</i>

1392
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:31,048
<i>We've left everything behind,</i>

1393
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:33,618
<i>but we found</i>
<i>ourselves and each other.</i>

1394
02:11:35,988 --> 02:11:39,523
<i>Tomorrow we may</i>
<i>have to fight again,</i>

1395
02:11:39,525 --> 02:11:42,927
<i>but,</i>
<i>for now, we'll ride the train</i>
<i>to the end of the line...</i>

1396
02:11:42,929 --> 02:11:44,428
<i>And then</i>

1397
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:45,463
<i>we'll jump.</i>
